####Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions.

<sup> 1)  Former title of the Agreement: Agreement Concerning the Adoption of Uniform Conditions of Approval for Motor Vehicle Equipment and Parts, done at Geneva on 20 March 1958.  </sup>   Preamble The Contracting Parties, Having decided to amend the Agreement Concerning the Adoption of Uniform Conditions of Approval and Reciprocal Recognition of Approval for Motor Vehicle Equipment and Parts, done at Geneva on 20 March 1958, and Desiring to define uniform technical prescriptions that it will suffice for certain wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts to fulfil in order to be used in their countries, Desiring to adopt these prescriptions whenever possible in their countries, and, Desiring to facilitate the use in their countries of the vehicles, equipment and parts, where approved according to these prescriptions by the competent authorities of another Contracting Party, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

1.  The Contracting Parties shall establish through an Administrative Committee made up of all the Contracting Parties in conformity with the internal rules set out in Appendix 1 and on the basis of the following articles and paragraphs, Regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles. Where necessary the technical requirements will include alternatives and when possible they will be performance oriented and include test methods. Conditions for granting type approvals and their reciprocal recognition will be included for use by Contracting Parties who choose to implement Regulations through type approval. For the purposes of this Agreement: The term “wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts" shall include any wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts whose characteristics have a bearing on road safety, protection of the environment and energy saving; The term “type approval pursuant to a Regulation" indicates an administrative procedure by which the competent authorities of one Contracting Party declare, after carrying out the required verifications, that a vehicle, equipment or parts submitted by the manufacturer as a prototype of the series production conform to the requirements of the given Regulation. Afterwards the manufacturer certifies that each vehicle, equipment or parts put on the market were produced to be identical with the approved product. For the application of the Regulations there could be various administrative procedures alternative to type approval. The only alternative procedure generally known and applied in certain Member States of the Economic Commission for Europe is the self-certification by which the manufacturer certifies, without any preliminary administrative control, that each product put on the market conforms to the given Regulation; the competent administrative authorities may verify by random sampling at the market that the self-certified products comply with the requirements of the given Regulation.   
2.  The Administrative Committee shall be composed of alle the Contracting Parties in accordance with the rules of procedure set out in Appendix 1. A Regulation, after having been established in accordance with the procedure indicated in Appendix 1, shall be communicated by the Administrative Committee to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, hereinafter called “Secretary-General". As soon as possible thereafter the Secretary-General shall give notification of this Regulation to the Contracting Parties. The Regulation will be considered as adopted unless, within a period of six months from its notification by the Secretary-General, more than one-third of the Contracting Parties at the time of notification have informed the Secretary-General of their disagreement with the Regulation. The Regulation shall cover the following: 

a) Wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts concerned;  

b) Technical requirements, which if necessary may include alternatives;  

c) Test methods by which any performance requirements are to be demonstrated;  

d) Conditions for granting type approval and their reciprocal recognition including any approval markings and conditions for ensuring conformity of production.  

e) The date(s) on which the Regulation enters into force.   The Regulation may, if needed, include references to the laboratories accredited by the competent authorities where acceptance tests of the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts submitted for approval must be carried out.   
3.  When a Regulation has been adopted the Secretary-General shall so notify as soon as possible all the Contracting Parties, specifying which Contracting Parties have objected and in respect of which the Regulation shall not enter into force.   
4.  The adopted Regulation shall enter into force on the date(s) specified therein as a Regulation annexed to this Agreement for all Contracting Parties which did not notify their disagreement.   
5.  When depositing its instrument of accession, any new Contracting Party may declare that it is not bound by certain Regulations then annexed to this Agreement or that it is not bound by any of them. If, at that time, the procedure laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article is in progress for a draft or adopted Regulation, the Secretary-General shall communicate such draft or adopted Regulation to the new Contracting Party and it shall enter into force as a Regulation for the new Contracting Party only under the conditions specified in paragraph 4 of this Article. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of the date of such entry into force. The Secretary-General shall also communicate to them all declarations concerning the non-application of certain Regulations that any Contracting Party may make in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.   
6.  Any Contracting Party applying a Regulation may at any time notify the Secretary-General, subject to one year's notice, that its administration intends to cease applying it. Such notification shall be communicated by the Secretary-General to the other Contracting Parties. Approvals granted shall remain valid until their withdrawal. If a Contracting Party ceases to issue approvals to a Regulation it shall: Maintain proper supervision on conformity of production of products for which it previously granted type approval; Take the necessary steps set out in Article 4 when advised of nonconformity by a Contracting Party that continues to apply the Regulation; Continue to notify the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties of withdrawal of approvals as set out in Article 5; Continue to grant extensions to existing approvals.   
7.  Any Contracting Party not applying a Regulation may at any time notify the Secretary-General that it intends henceforth to apply it, and the Regulation will then enter into force for this Party on the sixtieth day after this notification. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of every entry into force of a Regulation for a new Contracting Party effected in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.   
8.  The Contracting Parties for which a Regulation is in force shall hereinafter be referred to as “the Contracting Parties applying a Regulation".   

### Article  2  

Each Contracting Party applying Regulations largely through type approval shall grant the type approvals and approval markings described in any Regulation for the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts covered by the Regulation, provided that it has the technical competence and is satisfied with the arrangements for ensuring conformity of the product with the approved type as set out in Appendix 2. Each Contracting Party applying a Regulation through type approval shall refuse the type approvals and approval markings covered by the Regulation if the above-mentioned conditions are not complied with.  

### Article  3  

Wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts for which type approvals have been issued by a Contracting Party in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement and manufactured either in the territory of a Contracting Party applying the Regulation concerned, or in such other country as is designated by the Contracting Party which has duly approved the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts concerned shall be held to be in conformity with the legislation of all the Contracting Parties applying the said Regulation through type approval.  

### Article  4  

Should the competent authorities of a Contracting Party applying a Regulation through type approval find that certain wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts bearing approval markings issued under the said Regulation by one of the Contracting Parties, do not conform to the approved types, they shall advise the competent authorities of the Contracting Party which issued the approval. That Contracting Party shall take the necessary steps to bring the products of those manufacturers into conformity with the approved types and shall advise the other Contracting Parties applying the Regulation through type approval of the steps it has taken, which may include, if necessary, the withdrawal of approval. Where there might be a threat to road safety or to the environment, the Contracting Party which issued the approval and after receiving the information about the nonconformity to the approved type(s) shall inform thereof all other Contracting Parties about the situation. Contracting Parties may prohibit the sale and use of such wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts in their territory.  

### Article  5  

The competent authorities of each Contracting Party applying Regulations through type approval shall send monthly to the competent authorities of the other Contracting Parties a list of the wheeled vehicle, equipment or parts, approvals of which it has refused to grant or has withdrawn during that month; in addition, on receiving a request from the competent authority of another Contracting Party applying a Regulation through type approval, it shall send forthwith to that competent authority a copy of all relevant information on which it based its decision to grant, refuse to grant, or to withdraw an approval of a wheeled vehicle, equipment or parts to that Regulation.

### 1  

####INITIAL ASSESSMENT

1.1.  The approval authority of a Contracting Party must verify – before granting type approval – the existence of satisfactory arrangements and procedures for ensuring effective control so that vehicles, equipment or parts when in production conform to the approved type.   
1.2.  The requirement in paragraph 1.1. must be verified to the satisfaction of the authority granting type approval but may also be verified, on behalf and at the request of the authority granting type approval, by the approval authority of another Contracting Party. In that case, the latter approval authority prepares a statement of compliance outlining the areas and production facilities it has covered as relevant to the product(s) to be type approved.   
1.3.  The approval authority must also accept the manufacturer's registration to harmonized standard ISO 9002 (the scope of which covers the product(s) to be approved) or an equivalent accreditation standard as satisfying the requirements of paragraph 1.1. The manufacturer must provide details of the registration and undertake to inform the approval authority of any revisions to its validity or scope.   
1.4.  On receiving an application from the authority of another Member State the approval authority shall send forthwith the statement of compliance mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1.2. or advise that it is not in a position to provide such a statement.   

### 2  

####CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION

2.1.  Every vehicle, equipment or part approved under Regulation annexed to this Agreement must be so manufactured as to conform to the type approved by meeting the requirements of this Appendix and of the said Regulation.   
2.2.  The approval authority of a Contracting Party granting a type approval pursuant to a Regulation annexed to this Agreement must verify the existence of adequate arrangements and documented control plans, to be agreed with the manufacturer for each approval, to carry out at specified intervals those tests of associated checks necessary to verify continued conformity with the approved type, including, specifically, where applicable, tests specified in the said Regulation.   
2.3.  The holder of the approval must in particular: 

2.3.1. Ensure the existence of procedures for effective control of the conformity of products (vehicles, equipment or parts) to the type approval;  

2.3.2. Have access to the testing equipment necessary for checking the conformity to each approved type;  

2.3.3. Ensure that test results data are recorded and that annexed documents remain available for a period to be determined in agreement with the approval authority. This period must not exceed 10 years;  

2.3.4. Analyze results of each type of test, in order to verify and ensure the stability of the product characteristics, making allowance for variation of an industrial production;  

2.3.5. Ensure that for each type of product, at least the checks prescribed in this Appendix and the tests prescribed in the applicable Regulations are carried out;  

2.3.6. Ensure that any set of samples or test pieces giving evidence of nonconformity in the type of test in question gives rise to a further sampling and test. All the necessary steps must be taken to restore conformity of the corresponding production.     
2.4.  The authority which has granted type approval may at any time verify the conformity control methods applied in each production facility. The normal frequency of these verifications must be consistent with the arrangements (if any) accepted under paragraph 1.2. or 1.3. of this Appendix and be such as to ensure that the relevant controls are reviewed over a period consistent with the climate of trust established by the approval authority.   
2.4.1.  At every inspection, the test records and production records must be available to the visiting inspector.   
2.4.2.  Where the nature of the test is appropriate, the inspector may select samples at random to be tested in the manufacturer's laboratory (or by the Technical Service where the Regulation annexed to this Agreement so provides). The minimum number of samples may be determined according to the results of the manufacturer's own verification.   
2.4.3.  Where the level of control appears unsatisfactory, or when it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in application of paragraph 2.4.2., the inspector must select samples to be sent to the Technical Service which conducts the type approval tests.   
2.4.4.  The approval authority may carry out any check or test prescribed in this Appendix or in the applicable Regulation annexed to this Agreement.   
2.4.5.  In cases where unsatisfactory results are found during an inspection, the approval authority must ensure that all necessary steps are taken to restore conformity of production as rapidly as possible.   

####Overeenkomst betreffende het aannemen van eenvormige technische eisen voor wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen die kunnen worden aangebracht en/of gebruikt op wielvoertuigen en de voorwaarden voor wederzijdse erkenning van goedkeuringen verleend op basis van deze eisen

<sup> 1)  Vroegere titel: Overeenkomst betreffende het aannemen van eenvormige goedkeuringsvoorwaarden en de wederzijdse erkenning van goedkeuring van uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen van motorrijtuigen; Genève, 20 maart 1958  </sup>   Preambule De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, Besloten hebbende de Overeenkomst betreffende het aannemen van eenvormige goedkeuringsvoorwaarden en de wederzijdse erkenning van goedkeuring van uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen van motorrijtuigen, gedaan te Genève op 20 maart 1958, te wijzigen, en Geleid door de wens eenvormige technische eisen vast te leggen waaraan bepaalde wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen moeten voldoen om in hun landen te kunnen worden gebruikt, Geleid door de wens deze eisen telkens wanneer dat mogelijk is, in hun landen aan te nemen, en Geleid door de wens het gebruik in hun landen van de op basis van deze eisen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij goedgekeurde voertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen te vergemakkelijken, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen stellen, door tussenkomst van een Administratief Comité samengesteld uit alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in overeenstemming met het in Aanhangsel I vervatte Huishoudelijk Reglement en op basis van de volgende artikelen en leden, Reglementen op voor wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen die kunnen worden aangebracht en/of gebruikt op wielvoertuigen. Indien nodig omvatten de technische eisen alternatieven en indien mogelijk zijn zij gericht op prestaties en bevatten zij beproevingsmethoden. Voorwaarden voor de verlening van typegoedkeuringen en de wederzijdse erkenning daarvan worden geregeld ten behoeve van Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die besluiten de Reglementen uit te voeren door middel van typegoedkeuring. Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt verstaan onder: „Wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen", alle wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen waarvan de eigenschappen van invloed zijn op de veiligheid van het wegverkeer, bescherming van het milieu en energiebesparing; „Typegoedkeuring ingevolge een Reglement", een administratieve procedure waardoor de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, na uitvoering van de vereiste verificaties, verklaren dat een door de fabrikant aangeboden prototype van een voertuig, uitrustingsstuk of onderdeel dat in serie wordt gefabriceerd, in overeenstemming is met de in het desbetreffende Reglement genoemde eisen. Vervolgens garandeert de fabrikant dat elk voertuig, uitrustingsstuk of onderdeel dat op de markt wordt gebracht zodanig is geproduceerd dat het identiek is aan het goedgekeurde product. Voor de toepassing van de Reglementen zijn tal van alternatieve administratieve procedures voor typegoedkeuring denkbaar. De enige algemeen bekende en toegepaste alternatieve procedure in bepaalde lidstaten van de Economische Commissie voor Europa is de fabrikantenverklaring waarmee de fabrikant, zonder enige voorafgaande administratieve controle, garandeert dat elk product dat op de markt wordt gebracht in overeenstemming is met het desbetreffende Reglement; de bevoegde administratieve autoriteiten kunnen in de markt door middel van steekproeven verifiëren of de overeenkomstig verklaarde producten voldoen aan de eisen van het desbetreffende Reglement.   
2.  Het Administratief Comité bestaat uit alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, in overeenstemming met het Huishoudelijk Reglement vervat in Aanhangsel 1. Nadat een Reglement in overeenstemming met de in Aanhangsel 1 weergegeven procedure is vastgelegd, wordt dit door het Administratief Comité toegezonden aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, hierna te noemen „Secretaris-Generaal". De Secretaris-Generaal deelt dit Reglement daarop zo spoedig mogelijk mede aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. De Reglementen worden geacht te zijn aangenomen, tenzij binnen een termijn van zes maanden na het tijdstip van mededeling door de Secretaris-Generaal meer dan een derde van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op het tijdstip van mededeling, de Secretaris-Generaal hebben medegedeeld dat zij bezwaar maken tegen het Reglement. Het Reglement heeft betrekking op: 

a. de desbetreffende wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen;  

b. de technische eisen, indien nodig met alternatieven;  

c. de beproevingsmethoden waarmee kan worden aangetoond dat aan de eisen wordt voldaan;  

d. de voorwaarden voor de verlening van typegoedkeuringen en de wederzijdse erkenning hiervan, met inbegrip van alle goedkeuringsmerken en voorwaarden voor conforme productie.  

e. de datum of data waarop het Reglement in werking treedt.   Indien nodig mag het Reglement referenties bevatten naar de door bevoegde autoriteiten geaccrediteerde laboratoria, waar de acceptatiebeproevingen voor de typen wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen die ter goedkeuring worden aangeboden, moeten worden verricht.   
3.  Wanneer een Reglement is aangenomen, doet de Secretaris-Generaal daarvan zo spoedig mogelijk mededeling aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, daarbij aangevend welke Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen daartegen bezwaar hebben aangetekend en ten aanzien waarvan het Reglement niet in werking zal treden.   
4.  Het aangenomen Reglement treedt als Reglement behorend bij deze Overeenkomst in werking op de daarin vermelde datum of data voor alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die daartegen geen bezwaar hebben aangetekend.   
5.  Elke nieuwe Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan, wanneer zij haar akte van toetreding nederlegt, verklaren dat zij niet gebonden is door bepaalde Reglementen, op dat ogenblik behorend bij deze Overeenkomst, of dat het door geen enkele daarvan is gebonden. Indien op dat tijdstip de werkwijze geregeld in het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel voor een ontwerp-Reglement of aangenomen Reglement wordt gevolgd, zendt de Secretaris-Generaal dit ontwerp toe aan de nieuwe Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en het ontwerp treedt ten aanzien van deze Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts in werking als Reglement onder de voorwaarden genoemd in het vierde lid van dit artikel. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de datum van deze inwerkingtreding mede. Hij deelt hun eveneens mede alle verklaringen die de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen betreffende het niet toepassen van bepaalde Reglementen ingevolge dit lid hebben afgelegd.   
6.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een Reglement toepast kan te allen tijde, met inachtneming van een termijn van een jaar, de Secretaris-Generaal kennisgeven van het feit dat haar bevoegde autoriteiten dit Reglement niet langer zullen toepassen. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze kennisgeving aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mede. Verleende goedkeuringen zijn geldig totdat zij worden ingetrokken. Indien een Partij stopt met de afgifte van goedkeuringen ingevolge een Reglement, heeft zij de volgende verplichtingen: Het handhaven van een deugdelijk toezicht op conforme productie van producten waarvoor zij eerder een typegoedkeuring heeft verleend; Het nemen van de nodige maatregelen omschreven in Artikel 4 ingeval zij een melding ontvangt van non-conformiteit door een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die het Reglement blijft toepassen; Het blijven kennisgeven aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van intrekkingen van goedkeuringen zoals omschreven in Artikel 5; Het blijven toekennen van uitbreidingen voor bestaande goedkeuringen.   
7.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een Reglement niet toepast kan te allen tijde de Secretaris-Generaal kennisgeven van het feit dat zij dit Reglement voortaan wenst toe te passen; het Reglement treedt ten aanzien van deze Partij in werking op de zestigste dag na deze kennisgeving. De Secretaris-Generaal geeft aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kennis van iedere inwerkingtreding van een Reglement ten aanzien van een nieuwe Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke zich voordoet ingevolge dit lid.

### Artikel  3  

Wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen waarvoor een typegoedkeuring door een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is verleend in overeenstemming met Artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst en die zijn vervaardigd op het grondgebied hetzij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die het desbetreffende Reglement toepast, hetzij van een ander land dat is aangewezen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die is overgegaan tot goedkeuring van het desbetreffende type wielvoertuig, uitrustingstuk of onderdeel, worden geacht in overeenstemming te zijn met de wetgeving van alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die genoemd Reglement door middel van typegoedkeuring toepassen.  

### Artikel  4  

Indien de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een Reglement door middel van typegoedkeuring toepast, vaststellen dat bepaalde wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen, voorzien van de goedkeuringsmerken krachtens dat Reglement verleend door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, niet conform het goedgekeurde type zijn, berichten zij zulks aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de goedkeuring verleende. Deze Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is gehouden de nodige maatregelen te nemen om de conformiteit met het goedgekeurde type te herstellen en aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement door middel van typegoedkeuring toepassen de daartoe genomen maatregelen te berichten, welke zich eventueel kunnen uitstrekken tot intrekking van de goedkeuring. Ingeval de veiligheid van het wegverkeer of het milieu in gevaar gebracht dreigt te worden, brengt de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de goedkeuring heeft verleend, na ontvangst van gegevens betreffende de non-conformiteit met het goedgekeurde type of de goedgekeurde typen, alle andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van de situatie op de hoogte. Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kunnen de verkoop en het gebruik van de desbetreffende wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen op hun grondgebied verbieden.  

### Artikel  5  

De bevoegde autoriteiten van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die Reglementen door middel van typegoedkeuring toepassen, zenden maandelijks aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een lijst van wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen waarvan zij de goedkeuring in die maand hebben geweigerd of ingetrokken; bovendien zenden zij wanneer zij een aanvraag hebben ontvangen van de bevoegde autoriteiten van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een Reglement door middel van typegoedkeuring toepast, deze autoriteiten onverwijld een exemplaar van alle documenten met relevante gegevens waarop zij hun beslissing tot verlening, weigering of intrekking van de goedkeuring van een wielvoertuig, uitrustingsstuk of onderdeel dat onder dat Reglement valt, hebben gebaseerd.

### Artikel  12  

De procedure voor wijziging van de Reglementen die bij deze Overeenkomst behoren, worden beheerst door de volgende bepalingen:  
1.  Wijzigingen van Reglementen worden vastgesteld door het Administratief Comité overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 1, tweede lid, en in overeenstemming met de procedure weergegeven in Aanhangsel 1. Waar nodig mag een wijziging de bestaande eisen bevatten als alternatief. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen geven aan welke alternatieven in de Reglementen zij toepassen. Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die alternatieven in een Reglement toepassen, zijn niet verplicht goedkeuringen krachtens voorafgaande alternatieven in hetzelfde Reglement te accepteren. Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die alleen de meest recente wijzigingen toepassen, zijn niet verplicht goedkeuringen krachtens eerdere wijzigingen of krachtens ongewijzigde Reglementen te accepteren. Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die eerdere wijzigingen of een ongewijzigd Reglement toepassen, accepteren goedkeuringen die zijn verleend krachtens latere wijzigingen. Nadat een wijziging van een Reglement is vastgesteld, wordt deze door het Administratief Comité aan de Secretaris-Generaal toegezonden. Zo spoedig mogelijk daarop deelt de Secretaris-Generaal deze wijziging mede aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement toepassen.   
2.  Een wijziging van een Reglement wordt geacht te zijn aangenomen tenzij, binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop de Secretaris-Generaal deze heeft medegedeeld, meer dan een derde van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement ten tijde van de mededeling toepassen, de Secretaris-Generaal op de hoogte hebben gebracht van hun bezwaar tegen de wijziging. Indien de Secretaris-Generaal na deze termijn geen verklaringen van bezwaar heeft ontvangen van meer dan een derde van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement toepassen, verklaart de Secretaris-Generaal de wijziging zo spoedig mogelijk als zijnde aangenomen en bindend voor die Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement toepassen en die daartegen geen bezwaar hebben gemaakt. Indien een Reglement wordt gewijzigd en ten minste een vijfde van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het ongewijzigde Reglement toepassen vervolgens verklaren dat zij het ongewijzigde Reglement wensen te blijven toepassen, wordt het ongewijzigde Reglement beschouwd als een alternatief voor het gewijzigde Reglement en formeel als zodanig opgenomen in het Reglement, en treedt het in werking op de datum van aanneming of inwerkingtreding van de wijziging. In dat geval zijn de verplichtingen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die het Reglement toepassen, dezelfde als die genoemd in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  In het geval dat een nieuwe Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tot deze Overeenkomst toetreedt tussen het tijdstip van mededeling door de Secretaris-Generaal van de wijziging van het Reglement en de inwerkingtreding van die wijziging, kan het desbetreffende Reglement ten aanzien van deze Overeenkomstsluitende Partij niet eerder in werking treden dan twee maanden nadat deze Partij de wijziging formeel aanvaard heeft, dan wel na het verstrijken van een termijn twee maanden na de termijn van zes maanden na de mededeling door de Secretaris-Generaal aan deze Partij van de voorgestelde wijziging.   

### Artikel  13  

De procedure voor wijziging van de tekst van deze Overeenkomst en de Aanhangsels wordt beheerst door de volgende bepalingen:  
1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan een of meer wijzigingen in deze Overeenkomst en de Aanhangsels voorstellen. De tekst van elke voorgestelde wijziging van deze Overeenkomst en de Aanhangsels wordt toegezonden aan de Secretaris-Generaal, die deze tekst mededeelt aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en ter kennis brengt van de andere in artikel 6, eerste lid, bedoelde landen.   
2.  Elke voorgestelde wijziging die is toegezonden overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard, indien geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop de Secretaris-Generaal de voorgestelde wijziging heeft toegezonden bezwaren heeft geuit.   
3.  De Secretaris-Generaal doet zo spoedig mogelijk mededeling aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen om hun te doen weten of een bezwaar tegen de voorgestelde wijziging is geuit. Indien een bezwaar is geuit tegen de voorgestelde wijziging, wordt de wijziging geacht niet te zijn aanvaard en heeft deze geen enkel rechtsgevolg. Indien geen bezwaar wordt gemaakt, treedt de wijziging voor alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in werking drie maanden na het verstrijken van de termijn van zes maanden bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  14

g. de inwerkingtreding van elke wijziging overeenkomstig artikel 13, derde lid.    

### Artikel  15  

1.  Indien de procedures voor aanneming van een nieuw Reglement zoals bedoeld in artikel 1, derde en vierde lid, van de ongewijzigde Overeenkomst op de datum van inwerkingtreding van de bovengenoemde bepalingen lopen, treedt het desbetreffende nieuwe Reglement in werking overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het vijfde lid van het genoemde artikel.   
2.  Indien de procedures voor aanneming van een wijziging van een Reglement zoals bedoeld in artikel 12, eerste lid, van de ongewijzigde Overeenkomst op de datum van inwerkingtreding van de bovengenoemde bepalingen lopen, treedt de wijziging in werking in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het genoemde artikel.   
3.  Indien alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bij de Overeenkomst hiermee instemmen, kan ieder Reglement dat krachtens de bepalingen van de ongewijzigde Overeenkomst is aangenomen, worden beschouwd als een Reglement dat is aangenomen in overeenstemming met de bovengenoemde bepalingen.

####PROCEDURES VOOR CONFORMITEIT VAN PRODUCTIE

### 1  

####INITIËLE BEOORDELING

1.1.  De goedkeurende autoriteit van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verifieert – alvorens de typegoedkeuring te verlenen – of er behoorlijke regelingen en procedures bestaan ter waarborging van een doeltreffende controle, opdat in productie zijnde voertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen conform het goedgekeurde type zijn.   
1.2.  Het vereiste van lid 1.1. moet worden geverifieerd ten genoegen van de autoriteit die de typegoedkeuring verleent, maar mag ook, namens en op verzoek van de autoriteit die de typegoedkeuring verleent, worden geverifieerd door de goedkeurende autoriteit van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. In een dergelijk geval stelt de laatste goedkeurende autoriteit een conformverklaring op waarin zij de door haar gecontroleerde locaties en productiefaciliteiten vermeldt die betrekking hebben op het product of de producten waarvoor een typegoedkeuring wordt gevraagd.   
1.3.  De goedkeurende autoriteit accepteert tevens de registratie van de fabrikant uit hoofde van de geharmoniseerde norm ISO 9002 (die betrekking heeft op het goed te keuren product of de goed te keuren producten) of een gelijkwaardige accrediteringsnorm die aan de vereisten van lid 1.1. voldoet. De fabrikant legt de gegevens betreffende de registratie over en brengt de goedkeurende autoriteit op de hoogte van alle herzieningen betreffende de geldigheid of werkingssfeer van de registratie.   
1.4.  Zodra de goedkeurende autoriteit een verzoek ontvangt van de autoriteit van een andere lidstaat, zendt zij onverwijld de in de laatste zin van punt 1.2. genoemde conformverklaring toe, of deelt zij mede dat zij een dergelijke verklaring niet kan overleggen.   

### 2  

####CONFORMITEIT VAN PRODUCTIE

2.1.  Elk voertuig, uitrustingsstuk of onderdeel dat uit hoofde van een Reglement behorend bij deze Overeenkomst wordt goedgekeurd, moet zodanig zijn gefabriceerd dat het overeenkomt met het goedgekeurde type en aan de eisen van dit Aanhangsel alsmede aan het desbetreffende Reglement voldoet.   
2.2.  De goedkeurende autoriteit van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een typegoedkeuring ingevolge een Reglement behorend bij deze Overeenkomst verleent, moet verifiëren of er behoorlijke bepalingen en schriftelijk vastgelegde inspectieprogramma's bestaan, die bij elke typegoedkeuring met de fabrikant moeten worden overeengekomen, zodat de beproevingen of daarbij behorende controles ter verificatie van de voortdurende conformiteit met het goedgekeurde type op vastgestelde tijdstippen worden uitgevoerd, met inbegrip van, indien van toepassing, de in het desbetreffende Reglement genoemde beproevingen.   
2.3.  De houder van een goedkeuring heeft de volgende verplichtingen: 

2.3.1. Zorgen voor het bestaan van procedures voor daadwerkelijke controle van de conformiteit van producten (voertuigen, uitrustingsstukken of onderdelen) met de typegoedkeuring.  

2.3.2. Toegang hebben tot de beproevingsapparatuur die nodig is voor het controleren van de conformiteit met ieder goedgekeurd type.  

2.3.3. Ervoor zorgen dat de beproevingsresultaten worden vastgelegd en dat bijgevoegde documenten gedurende een in overeenstemming met de goedkeurende autoriteit vast te stellen periode beschikbaar blijven. Deze periode bedraagt ten hoogste 10 jaren.  

2.3.4. Het analyseren van de resultaten van elke soort beproeving, om de stabiliteit van de productkenmerken te kunnen verifiëren en waarborgen, rekening houdend met de mogelijke variatie in industriële productie.  

2.3.5. Ervoor zorgen dat op elk type product ten minste de in dit Aanhangsel voorgeschreven controles en de in de desbetreffende Reglementen voorgeschreven beproevingen worden verricht.  

2.3.6. Ervoor zorgen dat elke serie monsternemingen of proefstukken waaruit blijkt dat er bij de desbetreffende soort beproeving geen sprake is van conformiteit, wordt gevolgd door verdere monsternemingen en beproevingen. Alle nodige maatregelen moeten worden getroffen om de desbetreffende productie wederom conform te maken.     
2.4.  De autoriteit die een typegoedkeuring heeft verleend, kan te allen tijde de in elke productiefaciliteit toegepaste methode voor conformiteitscontrole verifiëren. De normale frequentie van deze verificaties moet in overeenstemming zijn met de (eventuele) regelingen geaccepteerd ingevolge lid 1.2. of 1.3. van dit Aanhangsel en moet zodanig zijn dat wordt gewaarborgd dat de bedoelde controles opnieuw worden beoordeeld over een periode die overeenkomt met het door de goedkeurende autoriteit gewekte vertrouwen.   
2.4.1.  Bij elke inspectie moeten de beproevingsgegevens en productiegegevens aan de inspecteur ter beschikking worden gesteld.   
2.4.2.  Indien de aard van de beproeving zich daartoe leent, kan de inspecteur steekproefsgewijs monsters nemen en deze ter beproeving aanbieden aan het laboratorium van de fabrikant (of aan de Technische Dienst indien zulks in een Reglement behorend bij deze Overeenkomst is voorzien). Het minimum aantal monsters mag worden vastgesteld aan de hand van de resultaten van de door de fabrikant zelf verrichte verificatie.   
2.4.3.  Indien blijkt dat het niveau van controle onvoldoende is, of wanneer het nodig lijkt de bruikbaarheid van de ingevolge lid 2.4.2. uitgevoerde beproevingen te verifiëren, moet de inspecteur monsters nemen die worden gezonden naar de Technische Dienst, die de typegoedkeurings-beproevingen uitvoert.   
2.4.4.  De goedkeurende autoriteit kan elke in dit Aanhangsel of in het desbetreffende Reglement in de bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst voorgeschreven controle of beproeving uitvoeren.   
2.4.5.  Indien een inspectie onbevredigende resultaten oplevert, draagt de goedkeurende autoriteit er zorg voor dat alle nodige maatregelen worden getroffen om zo spoedig mogelijk de conformiteit van productie te herstellen."
