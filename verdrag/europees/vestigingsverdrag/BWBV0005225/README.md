The Governments signatory hereto, being Members of the Council of Europe, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to safeguard and to realise the ideals and principles which are the common heritage of its Members and to facilitate their economic and social progress; Recognising the special character of the links between the member countries of the Council of Europe as affirmed in conventions and agreements already concluded within the framework of the Council such as the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed on 4th November, 1950, the Protocol to this Convention signed on 20th March, 1952, the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance and the two European Interim Agreements on Social Security signed on 11th December, 1953; Being convinced that, by the conclusion of a regional convention, the establishment of common rules for the treatment accorded to nationals of each Member State in the territory of the others may further the achievement of greater unity; Affirming that the rights and privileges which they grant to each other's nationals are conceded solely by virtue of the close association uniting the member countries of the Council of Europe by means of its Statute; Noting that the general plan of the Convention fits into the framework of the organisation of the Council of Europe,   Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####Entry, Residence and Expulsion

### Article  18  

No Contracting Party may forbid nationals of another Party who have been lawfully engaged for at least five years in an appropriate occupation in the territory of the former Party from taking part on an equal footing with its own nationals as electors in elections held by bodies or organisations of an economic or professional nature such as Chambers of Commerce or of Agricultural or Trade Associations, subject to the decisions which such bodies or organisations may take in this respect within the limits of their competence.  

### Article  19

(a) Each Contracting Party shall have the right to judge by national criteria: 

(1) the reasons of “ *ordre public*, national security, public health or morality” which may provide grounds for the exclusion from its territory of nationals of other Parties;  

(2) “the economic and social conditions” which may prevent the admission of nationals of other Parties to prolonged or permanent residence or the exercise of gainful occupations in its territory;  

(3) the circumstances which constitute a threat to national security or an offence against *ordre public* or morality;  

(4) the reasons specified in the Convention for which a Contracting Party may reserve for its own nationals the acquisition, possession or use of any categories of property or the exercise of certain rights and occupations or may make the exercise thereof by nationals of the other Parties subject to special conditions.    

(b) Each Contracting Party shall determine whether the reasons for expulsion are of a “particularly serious nature”. In this connection account shall be taken of the behaviour of the individual concerned during his whole period of residence.

Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij genieten op het grondgebied van een andere Partij een behandeling welke gelijk is aan die welke wordt genoten door onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij ten aanzien van het genot van de burgerlijke rechten, hetzij van persoonlijke hetzij van vermogensrechtelijke aard.  

### Artikel  5  

In afwijking van de bepalingen van artikel 4 van dit Verdrag, kan iedere Verdragsluitende Partij, om redenen van nationale veiligheid of verdediging, de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van goederen, van welke soort ook, aan haar eigen onderdanen voorbehouden, of onderdanen van andere Partijen aan speciale voorwaarden welke voor vreemdelingen ten aanzien van zodanige goederen gelden, onderwerpen.  

### Artikel  6  

1.  Afgezien van de gevallen welke betrekking hebben op nationale veiligheid of verdediging 

(a) dient iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van bepaalde soorten goederen aan haar eigen onderdanen heeft voorbehouden of, in het geval van vreemdelingen - waaronder begrepen onderdanen van andere Partijen -, aan bepaalde voorschriften heeft onderworpen, of de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van zodanige goederen afhankelijk heeft gesteld van wederkerigheid, op het ogenblik van ondertekening van dit Verdrag aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa een lijst van deze beperkingen over te leggen waarop wordt aangegeven, op welke bepalingen van haar nationale wetgeving zodanige beperkingen zijn gebaseerd. De Secretaris-Generaal zendt deze lijsten door aan de andere ondertekenende Regeringen;  

(b) voert, nadat dit Verdrag ten aanzien van enige Verdragsluitende Partij in werking is getreden, die Verdragsluitende Partij geen verdere beperkingen in ten aanzien van de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van enige soort goederen door onderdanen van de andere Partijen, tenzij zij zich daartoe verplicht ziet uit hoofde van dwingende redenen van economische of sociale aard of teneinde de monopolisering van de vitale bronnen van het land te verhinderen. In dat geval houdt zij de Secretaris-Generaal volledig op de hoogte van de genomen maatregelen, de daarop betrekking hebbende bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving en de beweegredenen voor dergelijke maatregelen. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze inlichtingen mede aan de andere Partijen.     
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij tracht, ten gunste van onderdanen van de andere Partijen, haar lijst van beperkingen te verminderen. Zij doet van iedere zodanige wijziging mededeling aan de Secretaris-Generaal, die ze aan de andere Partijen mededeelt. Iedere Partij tracht tevens aan onderdanen van andere Partijen die uitzonderingen op de algemene ten aanzien van vreemdelingen van kracht zijnde voorschriften toe te staan, als uit hoofde van de bepalingen van haar eigen wetgeving mogelijk is.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Gerechtelijke en administratieve garanties

### Artikel  7  

Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij genieten op het grondgebied van een andere Partij, onder dezelfde voorwaarden als onderdanen van die andere Partij, volledige wettelijke en gerechtelijke bescherming van persoon en goed en van hun rechten en belangen. In het bijzonder hebben zij, op dezelfde wijze als onderdanen van die andere Partij, het recht zich te wenden tot de bevoegde gerechtelijke en administratieve instanties, en het recht zich te doen bijstaan door ieder persoon te hunner keuze die, volgens de wetten van het land, daartoe bevoegd is.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij hebben, op het grondgebied van een andere Partij, recht op kosteloze rechtsbijstand onder dezelfde voorwaarden als onderdanen van die andere Partij.   
2.  Behoeftige onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij hebben, op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, er recht op dat uittreksels uit akten van de burgerlijke stand kosteloos aan hen worden verstrekt, voor zover dergelijke uittreksels kosteloos worden verstrekt aan behoeftige onderdanen van die andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Geen zekerheidstelling of dépôt, onder welke benaming ook, kan op grond hetzij van hun hoedanigheid van vreemdelingen, hetzij van gemis van domicilie of verblijfplaats in het land, worden gevorderd van onderdanen van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen, die hun domicilie of gewoon verblijf op het grondgebied van een van die Partijen hebben, wanneer zij als eisers of tussenkomende partijen voor de rechtbanken van een ander van die Partijen optreden.   
2.  Dezelfde regel is van toepassing op de storting, welke tot dekking der gerechtskosten van eisers of tussenkomende partijen mocht worden gevorderd.   
3.  De veroordelingen in de kosten van het geding, uitgesproken tegen de eiser of de tussenkomende partij, die hetzij krachtens de voorafgaande leden van dit artikel, hetzij krachtens de wet van het land waar het geding is aangelegd, vrijgesteld is van de zekerheidstelling, het dépôt of de storting, worden ingevolge een langs diplomatieke weg gedaan verzoek, kosteloos uitvoerbaar verklaard door de bevoegde autoriteit op het grondgebied van ieder der andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Uitoefening van op winst gerichte activiteit

### Artikel  10  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij machtigt onderdanen van de andere Partijen tot het op haar grondgebied uitoefenen van op winst gerichte activiteit op voet van gelijkheid met haar eigen onderdanen, tenzij genoemde Verdragsluitende Partij ernstige economische of sociale redenen heeft om deze machtiging niet te verlenen. Deze bepaling is van toepassing op, doch niet beperkt tot, industriële, commerciële, financiële en agrarische activiteiten, ambachten en de vrije beroepen, ongeacht het feit of de betrokken persoon voor eigen rekening werkt of in dienst is van een werkgever.  

### Artikel  11  

Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij aan wie door een andere Partij is toegestaan gedurende een bepaalde periode een op winst gerichte activiteit uit te oefenen, mogen, gedurende die periode, niet worden onderworpen aan beperkingen waarin op het ogenblik waarop de machtiging aan hen werd verleend niet was voorzien, tenzij zodanige beperkingen onder gelijke omstandigheden eveneens van toepassing zijn op onderdanen van die andere Partij.  

### Artikel  12  

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij die rechtmatig op het grondgebied van enige andere Partij wonen, zijn, zonder te worden onderworpen aan de in artikel 10 van dit Verdrag bedoelde beperkingen, gemachtigd enigerlei op winst gerichte activiteit uit te oefenen op voet van gelijkheid met onderdanen van de andere Partij, mits zij voldoen aan een van de hiernavolgende voorwaarden: 

(a) zij moeten op dat grondgebied gedurende een ononderbroken tijdvak van vijf jaar rechtmatig een op winst gerichte activiteit hebben uitgeoefend;  

(b) zij moeten gedurende een ononderbroken tijdvak van tien jaar rechtmatig op dat grondgebied hebben gewoond;  

(c) zij moeten toestemming hebben gekregen duurzaam op dat grondgebied te verblijven.   Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan, op het ogenblik van ondertekening of van nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag, verklaren dat zij een of twee van bovenstaande voorwaarden niet aanvaardt.   
2.  Zij kan tevens, overeenkomstig bovenstaande procedure, het in lid 1 *(a)* van dit artikel bepaalde tijdvak uitbreiden tot ten hoogste tien jaar met dien verstande dat na afloop van het eerste tijdvak van vijf jaar verlenging van de machtiging in geen geval kan worden geweigerd ten aanzien van de tot op dat ogenblik uitgeoefende activiteit. Een dergelijke verlenging mag eveneens niet afhankelijk worden gesteld van enige verandering van die activiteit. Zij kan tevens verklaren, dat zij niet in alle gevallen automatisch het recht zal verlenen van een dienstbetrekking over te gaan tot het uitoefenen van een zelfstandige activiteit.   

### Artikel  13  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan aan haar eigen onderdanen de uitoefening voorbehouden van openbare ambten of activiteiten welke verband houden met nationale veiligheid of verdediging, dan wel de uitoefening van deze activiteiten door vreemdelingen aan speciale voorwaarden onderwerpen.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Afgezien van de in artikel 13 van dit Verdrag genoemde onderwerpen 

(a) dient iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die bepaalde activiteiten aan haar eigen onderdanen heeft voorbehouden of de uitoefening van die activiteiten door vreemdelingen - waaronder begrepen onderdanen van de andere Partijen - afhankelijk heeft gesteld van bepalingen of van wederkerigheid, op het ogenblik van ondertekening van dit Verdrag aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa een lijst van deze beperkingen over te leggen waarop wordt aangegeven, op welke bepalingen van haar nationale wetgeving zodanige beperkingen zijn gebaseerd. De Secretaris-Generaal zendt deze lijsten door aan de andere ondertekenende Regeringen;  

(b) voert, nadat dit Verdrag ten aanzien van enige Verdragsluitende Partij in werking is getreden, die Partij geen nieuwe beperkingen in ten aanzien van de uitoefening van op winst gerichte activiteit door onderdanen van de andere Partijen, tenzij zij zich daartoe verplicht ziet uit hoofde van dwingende redenen van economische of sociale aard. In dat geval houdt zij de Secretaris-Generaal volledig op de hoogte van de genomen maatregelen, de daarop betrekking hebbende bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving en de redenen voor dergelijke maatregelen. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze inlichtingen aan de andere Partijen mede.     
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij tracht, ten gunste van de onderdanen van de andere Partijen: 

- de lijst van activiteiten welke aan haar eigen onderdanen zijn voorbehouden of waarvan de uitoefening door vreemdelingen afhankelijk is gesteld van bepalingen of van wederkerigheid, te verminderen; zij doet van iedere zodanige wijziging mededeling aan de Secretaris-Generaal, die ze aan de andere Partijen mededeelt;  

- in individuele gevallen vrijstelling van de van kracht zijnde bepalingen toe te staan, voor zover haar wetten daarin voorzien.     

### Artikel  15  

De uitoefening door onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied van een andere Partij van een activiteit waarvoor onderdanen van die andere Partij een bewijs van vak- of technische bekwaamheid moeten bezitten of waarborgen moeten verstrekken, wordt afhankelijk gesteld van het verstrekken van dezelfde waarborgen of het bezit van dezelfde bewijzen van bekwaamheid of andere welke, volgens het oordeel van de bevoegde nationale autoriteit, daaraan gelijkwaardig zijn. Onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die rechtmatig hun beroep uitoefenen op het grondgebied van een Partij kunnen echter door een van hun collega's naar het grondgebied van een andere Partij worden geroepen ten einde in een bepaald geval bijstand te verlenen.  

### Artikel  16  

Handelsreizigers die onderdanen zijn van een Verdragsluitende Partij en in dienst zijn van een onderneming wier voornaamste centrum van werkzaamheden ligt op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij, hebben geen enkele machtiging nodig ten einde hun beroep op het grondgebied van een andere Partij uit te oefenen mits zij daar per half jaar niet langer dan twee maanden verblijven.  

### Artikel  17  

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij genieten op het grondgebied van een andere Partij ten aanzien van wettelijke, door een openbare instantie vastgestelde regelingen inzake lonen en arbeidsvoorwaarden in het algemeen, een behandeling welke niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt genoten door onderdanen van die andere Partij.   
2.  De bepalingen van dit Hoofdstuk worden niet zo uitgelegd, dat zij een Verdragsluitende Partij verplichten op haar grondgebied aan onderdanen van een andere Partij ten aanzien van de uitoefening van op winst gerichte activiteit een behandeling toe te kennen welke gunstiger is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan haar eigen onderdanen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Individuele rechten

### Artikel  18  

Een Verdragsluitende Partij mag onderdanen van een andere Partij, die tenminste vijf jaar op het grondgebied van eerstgenoemde Partij rechtmatig een daarvoor geëigend beroep hebben uitgeoefend, niet verbieden onder dezelfde voorwaarden als haar eigen onderdanen in de hoedanigheid van kiesman deel te nemen aan verkiezingen welke worden gehouden door economische of beroepslichamen of -organisaties, zoals Kamers van Koophandel of Landbouwverenigingen of Beroepsbonden, met inachtneming van de beslissingen welke zulke lichamen of organisaties in dit opzicht binnen de grenzen van hun bevoegdheid kunnen nemen.  

### Artikel  19  

Het is onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied van een andere Partij toegestaan, zonder enige andere beperkingen dan die welke van toepassing zijn op onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij, als scheidsmannen op te treden in scheidsrechterrijke procedures waarin de keuze van de scheidsmannen geheel aan de betrokken partijen is overgelaten.  

### Artikel  20  

Voor zover de toelating tot het onderwijs is overgelaten aan de bevoegdheid van de Staat, worden onderdanen van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die de schoolgaande leeftijd hebben en rechtmatig op het grondgebied van enige andere Partij wonen, onder dezelfde voorwaarden als onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij toegelaten tot instellingen voor lager en middelbaar onderwijs en technisch en vakonderwijs. De toepassing van deze bepaling op het verstrekken van studiebeurzen wordt aan de beslissing van ieder der Partijen overgelaten. Voor onderdanen van schoolgaande leeftijd die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen bestaat leerplicht indien er ook leerplicht bestaat voor onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Belastingheffing, burgerlijke dienstplicht, onteigening, nationalisatie

### Artikel  21  

1.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen inzake dubbele belasting vervat in reeds gesloten of nog te sluiten overeenkomsten, worden onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij niet onderworpen aan andere, hogere of drukkender rechten, heffingen, belastingen of bijdragen, hoe ook genaamd, dan die welke onder soortgelijke omstandigheden van onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij worden gevorderd; zij hebben in het bijzonder recht op verminderingen of vrijstellingen van belastingen of heffingen en op alle aftrekken met inbegrip van aftrekken voor gezinsleden.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij legt aan onderdanen van een andere Partij geen verblijfsbelasting op welke niet van haar eigen onderdanen wordt geëist. Deze bepaling verhindert echter niet dat in daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen heffingen worden gevorderd welke verband houden met administratieve formaliteiten zoals de afgifte van vergunningen en machtigingen welker bezit voor vreemdelingen is vereist, met dien verstande echter dat die heffingen niet hoger mogen zijn dan de aan zodanige formaliteiten verbonden kosten.   

### Artikel  22  

Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij kunnen in geen geval worden verplicht op het grondgebied van een andere Partij andere of drukkender burgerlijke diensten te verrichten - hetzij van persoonlijke hetzij van vermogensrechtelijke aard - dan die welke worden geëist van onderdanen van laatstgenoemde Partij.  

### Artikel  23  

Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 1 van het Protocol bij het Verdrag tot bescherming van de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden, hebben onderdanen van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij, in het geval van onteigening of nationalisatie van hun eigendom door een andere Partij, recht op een behandeling die tenminste even gunstig is als de behandeling van onderdanen van die andere Partij.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII

Deze Commissie doet alle voorstellen welke erop zijn gericht de tenuitvoerlegging van het Verdrag in de praktijk te verbeteren en, indien zulks noodzakelijk is, zijn bepalingen te wijzigen of aan te vullen.   
2.  Indien tussen de Partijen verschil van mening mocht ontstaan ten aanzien van de uitlegging of toepassing van de bepalingen van artikel 6, lid 1 *(b),* en artikel 14, lid 1 *(b),* van dit Verdrag, tracht de Commissie, op verzoek van een der betrokken Partijen, een zodanig geschil te regelen.   
3.  De Commissie doet een periodiek verslag verschijnen dat alle inlichtingen bevat inzake de wetten en regelingen welke op het grondgebied van de Partijen van kracht zijn ten aanzien van in dit Verdrag geregelde zaken.   
4.  Ieder Lid van de Raad van Europa dat dit Verdrag heeft bekrachtigd, benoemt een vertegenwoordiger bij deze Commissie. Ieder ander Lid van de Raad kan zich doen vertegenwoordigen door een waarnemer met raadgevende stem.   
5.  De Commissie wordt bijeengeroepen door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa. De eerste zitting vindt plaats binnen drie maanden na de datum van instelling. Daarna worden de zittingen tenminste eenmaal per twee jaar gehouden. De Commissie kan ook worden bijeengeroepen wanneer het Comité van Ministers van de Raad dit noodzakelijk acht. Het tijdvak van twee jaar wordt gerekend van de datum van het einde van de laatste zitting af.   
6.  Meningen of aanbevelingen van de Permanente Commissie worden voorgelegd aan het Comité van Ministers.   
7.  De Permanente Commissie stelt haar eigen huishoudelijk reglement op.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  25  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag laten onverlet de bepalingen van de nationale wetgevingen, bilaterale of multilaterale verdragen of overeenkomsten welke van kracht zijn of van kracht kunnen worden en krachtens welke een gunstiger behandeling zou worden toegekend aan onderdanen van een of meer andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.

Een zodanige intrekking geschiedt door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad gerichte mededeling en wordt van kracht op de datum van ontvangst van een zodanige mededeling. De Secretaris-Generaal doet aan alle Regeringen die dit Verdrag ondertekenen, de tekst van deze mededeling toekomen.   

### Artikel  27  

Een Verdragsluitende Partij die in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 26 van dit Verdrag een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt ten aanzien van een afzonderlijke bepaling van het Verdrag, kan niet eisen dat bedoelde bepaling door een andere Partij wordt toegepast, behalve voor zover zij zelf de bepaling heeft aanvaard.  

### Artikel  28  

1.  In tijd van oorlog of in geval van een andere algemene noodtoestand welke het bestaan van de natie bedreigt, kan iedere Verdragsluitende Partij maatregelen nemen welke afwijken van haar verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag in de mate waarin de toestand zulks absoluut vereist en onder voorbehoud dat zulke maatregelen niet in strijd zijn met haar andere verplichtingen krachtens het internationale recht.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die gebruik maakt van dit recht om af te wijken van haar verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag, houdt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa volledig op de hoogte van de maatregelen welke zij heeft genomen en de daaraan ten grondslag liggende redenen. Zij deelt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad ook mede, wanneer zulke maatregelen niet langer van kracht zijn en de bepalingen van het Verdrag wederom volledig worden toegepast.

Het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Protocol vormt een integrerend onderdeel van het Verdrag.  

### Artikel  33  

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan dit Verdrag slechts opzeggen na verloop van een tijdvak van vijf jaar, te rekenen van de datum waarop dit Verdrag te haren opzichte in werking treedt, na het zes maanden van te voren te hebben opgezegd door middel van een schriftelijke mededeling gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, die zulks aan de andere Partijen mededeelt. Een Partij die niet op deze wijze gebruik maakt van het recht van opzegging blijft daarna gebonden voor verdere tijdvakken van twee jaar en kan dit Verdrag slechts opzeggen tegen de afloop van een zodanig tijdvak, na zes maanden van te voren schriftelijk te hebben opgezegd.   
2.  Opzegging kan niet tot gevolg hebben dat de Verdragsluitende Partij ontslagen wordt van uit hoofde van dit Verdrag op haar rustende verplichtingen ten aanzien van een door haar vóór de datum waarop de opzegging van kracht werd, verrichte handeling.   
3.  Onder dezelfde voorwaarden houdt iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die ophoudt Lid te zijn van de Raad van Europa, op Partij te zijn bij dit Verdrag.

### Protocol  

### AFDELING  I  

####Artikelen 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, lid 1 (b), 10, 13 en 14, lid 1 (b)

(a) Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij heeft het recht, nationale criteria aan te leggen bij de beoordeling van: 

(1) „de redenen van openbare orde, nationale veiligheid, volksgezondheid of goede zeden” welke zich zouden kunnen verzetten tegen toegang van onderdanen van andere Partijen tot haar grondgebied;  

(2) de „economische en sociale toestand” welke zich zou kunnen verzetten tegen toegang van onderdanen van andere Partijen voor voortgezet of duurzaam verblijf of de uitoefening van op winst gerichte activiteit op haar grondgebied;  

(3) de omstandigheden welke een gevaar vormen voor de nationale veiligheid of een inbreuk op de openbare orde of goede zeden;  

(4) de in het Verdrag genoemde redenen om welke een Verdragsluitende Partij de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van goederen, van welke soort ook, of de uitoefening van bepaalde rechten en activiteiten aan haar eigen onderdanen kan voorbehouden, of onderdanen van andere Partijen in dit opzicht aan speciale voorwaarden kan onderwerpen.    

(b) Het staat aan iedere Verdragsluitende Partij te beoordelen of de redenen voor verwijdering van „bijzonder ernstige aard” zijn. Bij deze beoordeling dient het gedrag van de betrokken persoon gedurende de gehele periode van verblijf in aanmerking te worden genomen.  

(c) Een Verdragsluitende Partij mag de rechten van onderdanen van andere Partijen slechts beperken op grond van de in dit Verdrag vermelde redenen en voor zover dit verenigbaar is met de door de Partijen aangegane verplichtingen.    

### AFDELING  II  

####Artikelen 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 en 20

(a) De voorschriften welke de toegang, het verblijf en het zich verplaatsen van vreemdelingen, alsmede hun recht om op winst gerichte activiteit uit te oefenen, regelen worden door dit Verdrag niet aangetast voor zover ze er niet mede in strijd zijn.  

(b) Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Partij worden geacht rechtmatig op het grondgebied van een andere Partij te wonen indien zij aan de onder *(a)* bedoelde voorschriften hebben voldaan.    

### AFDELING  III  

####Artikelen 1, 2 en 3

(a) Het begrip „openbare orde” dient te worden opgevat in de ruime betekenis die daaraan in de landen van het vasteland van Europa algemeen wordt gegeven. Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan een onderdaan van een andere Partij bijvoorbeeld toegang weigeren om politieke redenen, of indien er gronden zijn om aan te nemen dat hij niet in staat is de kosten van zijn verblijf te betalen of dat hij van plan is zonder de nodige vergunningen op winst gerichte activiteit uit te oefenen.  

(b) Bij de uitoefening van hun erkende rechten, nemen de Verdragsluitende Partijen op zich rekening te houden met familiebanden.  

(c) Het recht van verwijdering kan slechts in individuele gevallen worden uitgeoefend. De Verdragsluitende Partijen hanteren dit recht met die omzichtigheid welke de bijzondere banden welke tussen de Leden van de Raad van Europa bestaan met zich brengen. Zij houden in het bijzonder rekening met familiebanden en de duur van het verblijf van de betrokken persoon op hun grondgebied.    

### AFDELING  IV  

####Artikelen 8 en 9

De artikelen 8 en 9 van dit Verdrag tasten op geen enkele wijze de verplichtingen aan welke zijn aangegaan krachtens de bepalingen van het te 's-Gravenhage gesloten Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering.  

### AFDELING  V  

####Artikelen 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 en 17

(a) De bepalingen van de artikelen 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 en 17 van dit Verdrag worden toegepast met inachtneming van de in de artikelen 1 en 2 neergelegde voorwaarden met betrekking tot toegang en wonen.
