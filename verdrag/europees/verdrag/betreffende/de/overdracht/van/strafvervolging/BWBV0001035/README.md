##Europees Verdrag betreffende de overdracht van strafvervolging

####European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters

The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is the achievement of greater unity between its Members; Desiring to supplement the work which they have already accomplished in the field of criminal law with a view to arriving at more just and efficient sanctions; Considering it useful to this end to ensure, in a spirit of mutual confidence, the organisation of criminal proceedings on the international level, in particular, by avoiding the disadvantages resulting from conflicts of competence, Have agreed as follows:     
### PART  I  

####Definitions

### Article  1  

For the purposes of this Convention 

(a) "offence" comprises acts dealt with under the criminal law and those dealt with under the legal provisions listed in Appendix III to this Convention on condition that where an administrative authority is competent to deal with the offence it must be possible for the person concerned to have the case tried by a court;  

(b) "sanction" means any punishment or other measure incurred or pronounced in respect of an offence or in respect of a violation of the legal provisions listed in Appendix III.    

### PART  II  

####Competence

### Article  2  

1.  For the purposes of applying this Convention, any Contracting State shall have competence to prosecute under its own criminal law any offence to which the law of another Contracting State is applicable.   
2.  The competence conferred on a Contracting State exclusively by virtue of paragraph 1 of this Article may be exercised only pursuant to a request for proceedings presented by another Contracting State.   

### Article  3  

Any Contracting State having competence under its own law to prosecute an offence may, for the purposes of applying this Convention, waive or desist from proceedings against a suspected person who is being or will be prosecuted for the same offence by another Contracting State. Having regard to Article 21, paragraph 2, any such decision to waive or to desist from proceedings shall be provisional pending a final decision in the other Contracting State.  

### Article  4  

The requested State shall discontinue proceedings exclusively grounded on Article 2 when to its knowledge the right of punishment is extinguished under the law of the requesting State for a reason other than time-limitation, to which Articles 10 *(c),* 11 *(f)* and *(g),* 22, 23 and 26 in particular apply.  

### Article  5  

The provisions of Part III of this Convention do not limit the competence given to a requested State by its municipal law in regard to prosecutions.  

### PART  III  

####Transfer of Proceedings

### SECTION  1  

####REQUEST FOR PROCEEDINGS

### Article  6  

1.  When a person is suspected of having committed an offence under the law of a Contracting State, that State may request another Contracting State to take proceedings in the cases and under the conditions provided for in this Convention.   
2.  If under the provisions of this Convention a Contracting State may request another Contracting State to take proceedings, the competent authorities of the first State shall take that possibility into consideration.   

### Article  7  

1.  Proceedings may not be taken in the requested State unless the offence in respect of which the proceedings are requested would be an offence if committed in its territory and when, under these circumstances, the offender would be liable to sanction under its own law also.   
2.  If the offence was committed by a person of public status or against a person, an institution or any thing of public status in the requesting State, it shall be considered in the requested State as having been committed by a person of public status or against such a person, an institution or any thing corresponding, in the latter State, to that against which it was actually committed.   

### Article  8  

1.  A Contracting State may request another Contracting State to take proceedings in any one or more of the following cases: 

(a) if the suspected person is ordinarily resident in the requested State;  

(b) if the suspected person is a national of the requested State or if that State is his State of origin;  

(c) if the suspected person is undergoing or is to undergo a sentence involving deprivation of liberty in the requested State;  

(d) if proceedings for the same or other offences are being taken against the suspected person in the requested State;  

(e) if it considers that transfer of the proceedings is warranted in the interests of arriving at the truth and in particular that the most important items of evidence are located in the requested State;  

(f) if it considers that the enforcement in the requested State of a sentence if one were passed is likely to improve the prospects for the social rehabilitation of the person sentenced;  

(g) if it considers that the presence of the suspected person cannot be ensured at the hearing of proceedings in the requesting State and that his presence in person at the hearing of proceedings in the requested State can be ensured;  

(h) if it considers that it could not itself enforce a sentence if one were passed, even by having recourse to extradition, and that the requested State could do so.     
2.  Where the suspected person has been finally sentenced in a Contracting State, that State may request the transfer of proceedings in one or more of the cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article only if it cannot itself enforce the sentence, even by having recourse to extradition, and if the other Contracting State does not accept enforcement of a foreign judgment as a matter of principle or refuses to enforce such sentence.   

### Article  9  

1.  The competent authorities in the requested State shall examine the request for proceedings made in pursuance of the preceding Articles. They shall decide, in accordance with their own law, what action to take thereon.   
2.  Where the law of the requested State provides for the punishment of the offence by an administrative authority, that State shall, as soon as possible, so inform the requesting State unless the requested State has made a declaration under paragraph 3 of this Article.   
3.  Any Contracting State may at the time of signature, or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, or at any later date indicate, by declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the conditions under which its domestic law permits the punishment of certain offences by an administrative authority. Such a declaration shall replace the notification envisaged in paragraph 2 of this Article.   

### Article  10  

The requested State shall not take action on the request: 

(a) if the request does not comply with the provisions of Articles 6, paragraph 1, and 7, paragraph 1;  

(b) if the institution of proceedings is contrary to the provisions of Article 35;  

(c) if, at the date on the request, the time-limit for criminal proceedings has already expired in the requesting State under the legislation of that State.    

### Article  11  

Save as provided for in Article 10 the requested State may not refuse acceptance of the request in whole or in part, except in any one or more of the following cases: 

(a) if it considers that the grounds on which the request is based under Article 8 are not justified;  

(b) if the suspected person is not ordinarily resident in the requested State;  

(c) if the suspected person is not a national of the requested State and was not ordinarily resident in the territory of that State at the time of the offence;  

(d) if it considers that the offence for which proceedings are requested is an offence of a political nature or a purely military or fiscal one;  

(e) if it considers that there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for proceedings was motivated by considerations of race, religion, nationality or political opinion;  

(f) if its own law is already applicable to the offence and if at the time of the receipt of the request proceedings were precluded by lapse of time according to that law; Article 26, paragraph 2, shall not apply in such a case;  

(g) if its competence is exclusively grounded on Article 2 and if at the time of the receipt of the request proceedings would be precluded by lapse of time according to its law, the prolongation of the timelimit by six months under the terms of Article 23 being taken into consideration;  

(h) if the offence was committed outside the territory of the requesting State;  

(i) if proceedings would be contrary to the international undertakings of the requested State;  

(j) if proceedings would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal system of the requested State;  

(k) if the requesting State has violated a rule of procedure laid down in this Convention.    

### Article  12  

1.  The requested State shall withdraw its acceptance of the request if, subsequent to this acceptance, a ground mentioned in Article 10 of this Convention for not taking action on the request becomes apparent.   
2.  The requested State may withdraw its acceptance of the request: 

(a) if it becomes apparent that the presence in person of the suspected person cannot be ensured at the hearing of proceedings in that State or that any sentence, which might be passed, could not be enforced in that State;  

(b) if one of the grounds for refusal mentioned in Article 11 becomes apparent before the case is brought before a court; or  

(c) in other cases, if the requesting State agrees.     

### SECTION  2  

####TRANSFER PROCEDURE

### Article  13  

1.  All requests specified in this Convention shall be made in writing. They, and all communications necessary for the application of this Convention, shall be sent either by the Ministry of Justice of the requesting State to the Ministry of Justice of the requested State or, by virtue of special mutual arrangement, direct by the authorities of the requesting State to those of the requested State; they shall be returned by the same channel.   
2.  In urgent cases, requests and communications may be sent through the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).   
3.  Any Contracting State may, by declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, give notice of its intention to adopt insofar as it itself is concerned rules of transmission other than those laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article.   

### Article  14  

If a Contracting State considers that the information supplied by another Contracting State is not adequate to enable it to apply this Convention, it shall ask for the necessary additional information. It may prescribe a date for the receipt of such information.  

### Article  15  

1.  A request for proceedings shall be accompanied by the original, or a certified copy, of the criminal file and all other necessary documents. However, if the suspected person is remanded in custody in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 and if the requesting State is unable to transmit these documents at the same time as the request for proceedings, the documents may be sent subsequently.   
2.  The requesting State shall also inform the requested State in writing of any procedural acts performed or measures taken in the requesting State after the transmission of the request which have a bearing on the proceedings. This communication shall be accompanied by any relevant documents.   

### Article  16  

1.  The requested State shall promptly communicate its decision on the request for proceedings to the requesting State.   
2.  The requested State shall also inform the requesting State of a waiver of proceedings or of the decision taken as a result of proceedings. A certified copy of any written decision shall be transmitted to the requesting State.   

### Article  17  

If the competence of the requested State is exclusively grounded on Article 2 that State shall inform the suspected person of the request for proceedings with a view to allowing him to present his views on the matter before that State has taken a decision on the request.  

### Article  18  

1.  Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, no translation of the documents relating to the application of this Convention shall be required.   
2.  Any Contracting State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, by declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, reserve the right to require that, with the exception of the copy of the written decision referred to in Article 16, paragraph 2, the said documents be accompanied by a translation. The other Contracting States shall send the translations in either the national language of the receiving State or such one of the official languages of the Council of Europe as the receiving State shall indicate. However, such an indication is not obligatory. The other Contracting States may claim reciprocity.   
3.  This Article shall be without prejudice to any provisions concerning translation of requests and supporting documents that may be contained in agreements or arrangements now in force or that may be concluded between two or more Contracting States.   

### Article  19  

Documents transmitted in application of this Convention need not be authenticated.  

### Article  20  

Contracting Parties shall not claim from each other the refund of any expenses resulting from the application of this Convention.  

### SECTION  3  

####EFFECTS IN THE REQUESTING STATE OF A REQUEST FOR PROCEEDINGS

### Article  21  

1.  When the requesting State has requested proceedings, it can no longer prosecute the suspected person for the offence in respect of which the proceedings have been requested or enforce a judgment which has been pronounced previously in that State against him for that offence. Until the requested State's decision on the request for proceedings has been received, the requesting State shall, however, retain its right to take all steps in respect of prosecution, short of bringing the case to trial, or, as the case may be, allowing the competent administrative authority to decide on the case.   
2.  The right of prosecution and of enforcement shall revert to the requesting State: 

(a) if the requested State informs it of a decision in accordance with Article 10 not to take action on the request;  

(b) if the requested State informs it of a decision in accordance with Article 11 to refuse acceptance of the request;  

(c) if the requested State informs it of a decision in accordance with Article 12 to withdraw acceptance of the request;  

(d) if the requested State informs it of a decision not to institute proceedings or discontinue them;  

(e) if it withdraws its request before the requested State has informed it of a decision to take action on the request.     

### Article  22  

A request for proceedings, made in accordance with the provisions of this Part, shall have the effect in the requesting State of prolonging the time-limit for proceedings by six months.  

### SECTION  4  

####EFFECTS IN THE REQUESTED STATE OF A REQUEST FOR PROCEEDINGS

### Article  23  

If the competence of the requested State is exclusively grounded on Article 2 the time-limit for proceedings in that State shall be prolonged by six months.  

### Article  24  

1.  If proceedings are dependent on a complaint in both States the complaint brought in the requesting State shall have equal validity with that brought in the requested State.   
2.  If a complaint is necessary only in the requested State, that State may take proceedings even in the absence of a complaint if the person who is empowered to bring the complaint has not objected within a period of one month from the date of receipt by him of notice from the competent authority informing him of his right to object.   

### Article  25  

In the requested State the sanction applicable to the offence shall be that prescribed by its own law unless that law provides otherwise. Where the competence of the requested State is exclusively grounded on Article 2, the sanction pronounced in that State shall not be more severe than that provided for in the law of the requesting State.  

### Article  26  

1.  Any act with a view to proceedings, taken in the requesting State in accordance with its law and regulations, shall have the same validity in the requested State as if it had been taken by the authorities of that State, provided that assimilation does not give such act a greater evidential weight than it has in the requesting State.   
2.  Any act which interrupts time-limitation and which has been validly performed in the requesting State shall have the same effects in the requested State and vice versa.   

### SECTION  5  

####PROVISIONAL MEASURES IN THE REQUESTED STATE

### Article  27  

1.  When the requesting State announces its intention to transmit a request for proceedings, and if the competence of the requested State would be exclusively grounded on Article 2, the requested State may, on application by the requesting State and by virtue of this Convention, provisionally arrest the suspected person: 

(a) if the law of the requested State authorises remand in custody for the offence, and  

(b) if there are reasons to fear that the suspected person will abscond or that he will cause evidence to be suppressed.     
2.  The application for provisional arrest shall state that there exists a warrant of arrest or other order having the same effect, issued in accordance with the procedure laid down in the law of the requesting State; it shall also state for what offence proceedings will be requested and when and where such offence was committed and it shall contain as accurate a description of the suspected person as possible. It shall also contain a brief statement of the circumstances of the case.   
3.  An application for provisional arrest shall be sent direct by the authorities in the requesting State mentioned in Article 13 to the corresponding authorities in the requested State, by post or telegram or by any other means affording evidence in writing or accepted by the requested State. The requesting State shall be informed without delay of the result of its application.   

### Article  28  

Upon receipt of a request for proceedings accompanied by the documents referred to in Article 15, paragraph 1, the requested State shall have jurisdiction to apply all such provisional measures, including remand in custody of the suspected person and seizure of property, as could be applied under its own law if the offence in respect of which proceedings are requested had been committed in its territory.  

### Article  29  

1.  The provisional measures provided in Articles 27 and 28 shall be governed by the provisions of this Convention and the law of the requested State. The law of that State, or the Convention shall also determine the conditions on which the measures may lapse.   
2.  These measures shall lapse in the cases referred to in Article 21, paragraph 2.   
3.  A person in custody shall in any event be released if he is arrested in pursuance of Article 27 and the requested State does not receive the request for proceedings within 18 days from the date of the arrest.   
4.  A person in custody shall in any event be released if he is arrested in pursuance of Article 27 and the documents which should accompany the request for proceedings have not been received by the requested State within 15 days from the receipt of the request for proceedings.   
5.  The period of custody applied exclusively by virtue of Article 27 shall not in any event exceed 40 days.   

### PART  IV  

####Plurality of Criminal Proceedings

### Article  30  

1.  Any Contracting State which, before the institution or in the course of proceedings for an offence which it considers to be neither of a political nature nor a purely military one, is aware of proceedings pending in another Contracting State against the same person in respect of the same offence shall consider whether it can either waive or suspend its own proceedings, or transfer them to the other State.   
2.  If it deems it advisable in the circumstances not to waive or suspend its own proceedings it shall so notify the other State in good time and in any event before judgment is given on the merits.   

### Article  31  

1.  In the eventuality referred to in Article 30, paragraph 2, the States concerned shall endeavour as far as possible to determine, after evaluation in each case of the circumstances mentioned in Article 8, which of them alone shall continue to conduct proceedings. During this consultative procedure the States concerned shall postpone judgment on the merits without however being obliged to prolong such postponement beyond a period of 30 days as from the despatch of the notification provided for in Article 30, paragraph 2.   
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not be binding: 

(a) on the State despatching the notification provided for in Article 30, paragraph 2, if the main trial has been declared open there in the presence of the accused before despatch of the notification;  

(b) on the State to which the notification is addressed, if the main trial has been declared open there in the presence of the accused before receipt of the notification.     

### Article  32  

In the interests of arriving at the truth and with a view to the application of an appropriate sanction, the States concerned shall examine whether it is expedient that one of them alone shall conduct proceedings and, if so, endeavour to determine which one, when: 

(a) several offences which are materially distinct and which fall under the criminal law of each of those States are ascribed either to a single person or to several persons having acted in unison;  

(b) a single offence which falls under the criminal law of each of those States is ascribed to several persons having acted in unison.    

### Article  33  

All decisions reached in accordance with Articles 31 paragraph 1, and 32 shall entail, as between the States concerned, all the consequences of a transfer of proceedings as provided for in this Convention. The State which waives its own proceedings shall be deemed to have transferred them to the other State.  

### Article  34  

The transfer procedure provided for in Section 2 of Part III shall apply in so far as its provisions are compatible with those contained in the present Part.  

### PART  V  

####Ne bis in idem

### Article  35  

1.  A person in respect of whom a final and enforceable criminal judgment has been rendered may for the same act neither be prosecuted nor sentenced nor subjected to enforcement of a sanction in another Contracting State: 

(a) if he was acquitted;  

(b) if the sanction imposed: 

(i) has been completely enforced or is being enforced, or  

(ii) has been wholly, or with respect to the part not enforced, the subject of a pardon or an amnesty, or  

(iii) can no longer be enforced because of lapse of time;    

(c) if the court convicted the offender without imposing a sanction.     
2.  Nevertheless, a Contracting State shall not, unless it has itself requested the proceedings, be obliged to recognise the effect of *ne bis in idem* if the act which gave rise to the judgment was directed against either a person or an institution or any thing having public status in that State, or if the subject of the judgment had himself a public status in that State.   
3.  Furthermore, a Contracting State where the act was committed or considered as such according to the law of that State shall not be obliged to recognise the effect of *ne bis in idem* unless that State has itself requested the proceedings.   

### Article  36  

If new proceedings are instituted against a person who in another Contracting State has been sentenced for the same act, then any period of deprivation of liberty arising from the sentence enforced shall be deducted from the sanction which may be imposed.  

### Article  37  

This Part shall not prevent the application of wider domestic provisions relating to the effect of *ne bis in idem* attached to foreign criminal judgments.  

### PART  VI  

####Final Clauses

### Article  43

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag is elke Verdragsluitende Staat bevoegd elk strafbaar feit waarop de strafwet van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat van toepassing is, te vervolgen op grond van zijn eigen strafwet.   
2.  De aan een Verdragsluitende Staat uitsluitend op grond van bet eerste lid van dit artikel toegekende bevoegdheid kan slechts worden uitgeoefend na een verzoek om strafvervolging, afkomstig van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat.   

### Artikel  3  

Elke Verdragsluitende Staat die krachtens zijn eigen wet bevoegd is tot het vervolgen van een strafbaar feit kan, voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag, afzien van strafvervolging of een ingestelde strafvervolging staken, ten aanzien van een verdachte die wegens hetzelfde feit wordt of zal worden vervolgd door een andere Verdragsluitende Staat. Gelet op het bepaalde in artikel 21, tweede lid, is de beslissing tot het afzien van of het staken van strafvervolging een voorlopige, zolang geen definitieve beslissing in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat is genomen.  

### Artikel  4  

De aangezochte Staat staakt de uitsluitend op artikel 2 gegronde strafvervolging, indien hij weet dat het recht tot strafvordering volgens de wet van de verzoekende Staat vervalt wegens een andere oorzaak dan de verjaring, waarop met name de artikelen 10, letter *c,* 11, letters *f* en *g,* 22, 23 en 26 van toepassing zijn.  

### Artikel  5  

De bepalingen van Titel III van dit Verdrag vormen geen beperking van de bevoegdheid tot strafvordering die de verzoekende Staat ontleent aan zijn eigen wet.  

### TITEL  III  

####Overdracht van strafvervolging

### AFDELING  1  

####VERZOEK TOT STRAFVERVOLGING

### Artikel  6  

1.  Indien een persoon wordt verdacht van het plegen van een strafbaar feit volgens de wet van een Verdragsluitende Staat, kan die Staat aan een andere Verdragsluitende Staat verzoeken over te gaan tot strafvervolging in de gevallen en op de gronden genoemd in dit Verdrag.   
2.  Indien volgens de bepalingen van dit Verdrag een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een andere Verdragsluitende Staat kan verzoeken over te gaan tot strafvervolging, dienen de bevoegde autoriteiten van eerstgenoemde Staat de mogelijkheid daartoe te overwegen.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  De strafvervolging kan slechts worden ingesteld in de aangezochte Staat indien het feit waarvoor strafvervolging is verzocht ware het op het grondgebied van die Staat begaan een strafbaar feit zou hebben opgeleverd en in dat geval aan de dader eveneens krachtens de wet van die Staat een sanctie had kunnen worden opgelegd.   
2.  Indien het strafbare feit is begaan door of ten aanzien van een persoon, die in de verzoekende Staat met een openbaar ambt is bekleed, dan wel ten aanzien van een tot de openbare dienst van die Staat behorende instelling of zaak, wordt het in de aangezochte Staat beschouwd als zijnde gepleegd door of ten aanzien van een persoon, dan wel een instelling of een zaak die aldaar tot de openbare dienst behoort.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan een andere Verdragsluitende Staat verzoeken over te gaan tot strafvervolging in een of meer van de volgende gevallen: 

(a) indien de verdachte zijn vaste woonplaats heeft in de aangezochte Staat;  

(b) indien de verdachte onderdaan is van de aangezochte Staat of indien hij uit die Staat afkomstig is;  

(c) indien de verdachte in de aangezochte Staat een sanctie ondergaat of moet ondergaan die vrijheidsbeneming met zich brengt;  

(d) indien de verdachte in de aangezochte Staat wordt vervolgd wegens hetzelfde strafbare feit of wegens andere strafbare feiten;  

(e) indien hij van oordeel is dat de overdracht is aangewezen in het belang van de waarheidsvinding, met name indien het belangrijkste bewijsmateriaal zich in de aangezochte Staat bevindt;  

(f) indien hij van oordeel is dat de tenuitvoerlegging van een eventuele veroordeling in de aangezochte Staat naar verwachting betere mogelijkheden biedt voor de reclassering van de veroordeelde;  

(g) indien hij van oordeel is dat de aanwezigheid van de verdachte ter terechtzitting in de verzoekende Staat niet kan worden verzekerd, terwijl diens aanwezigheid ter terechtzitting in de aangezochte Staat wel kan worden verzekerd;  

(h) indien hij van oordeel is dat hij niet in staat is zelf een eventuele veroordeling ten uitvoer te leggen, zelfs niet met toepassing van uitlevering, en dat de aangezochte Staat daartoe wel in staat is.     
2.  Indien de verdachte in een Verdragsluitende Staat onherroepelijk is veroordeeld, kan die Staat geen overdracht van de strafvervolging verzoeken in een of meer van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel vermelde gevallen tenzij hij de sanctie, ook met toepassing van uitlevering, niet zelf ten uitvoer kan leggen en de andere Verdragsluitende Staat het beginsel van de tenuitvoerlegging van een in het buitenland gewezen vonnis niet aanvaardt of weigert een vonnis als het onderhavige ten uitvoer te leggen.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Staat onderwerpen het aan hen met toepassing van de voorgaande artikelen gerichte verzoek tot strafvervolging aan een onderzoek. Zij beslissen overeenkomstig hun eigen wetgeving welk gevolg aan het verzoek zal worden gegeven.   
2.  Indien de wet van de aangezochte Staat voorziet in de bestraffing van het strafbare feit door een bestuurlijke autoriteit geeft die Staat daarvan zo spoedig mogelijk kennis aan de verzoekende Staat, tenzij de aangezochte Staat een verklaring heeft afgelegd krachtens het derde lid van dit artikel.   
3.  Elke Verdragsluitende Staat kan op het ogenblik van ondertekening of van nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding of op elk ander tijdstip door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa gerichte verklaring de gevallen opgeven waarin zijn nationale wet voorziet in de afdoening van strafbare feiten door een bestuurlijke autoriteit. Een zodanige verklaring vervangt de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde kennisgeving.   

### Artikel  10  

De aangezochte Staat geeft geen gevolg aan het verzoek: 

(a) indien het verzoek niet in overeenstemming is met het bepaalde in artikel 6, eerste lid, en in artikel 7, eerste lid;  

(b) indien het instellen van de strafvervolging indruist tegen het bepaalde in artikel 35;  

(c) indien op de in het verzoek vermelde datum het recht tot strafvordering in de verzoekende Staat is verjaard volgens de wet van die Staat.    

### Artikel  11  

Onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 10 kan de aangezochte Staat slechts in een of meer van de volgende gevallen de aanvaarding van het verzoek geheel of gedeeltelijk weigeren: 

(a) indien hij van oordeel is dat de in artikel 8 genoemde gronden waarop het verzoek berust, zich niet voordoen;  

(b) indien de verdachte geen vaste woonplaats heeft in de aangezochte Staat;  

(c) indien de verdachte geen onderdaan is van de aangezochte Staat en geen vaste woonplaats had op het grondgebied van die Staat ten tijde van het begaan van het strafbare feit;  

(d) indien hij van oordeel is dat het strafbare feit waarvoor de strafvervolging is verzocht van politieke aard is of als een zuiver militair of zuiver fiscaal delict moet worden beschouwd;  

(e) indien hij ernstige redenen meent te hebben om aan te nemen dat het verzoek tot strafvervolging is ingegeven door overwegingen van ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit of politieke overtuiging;  

(f) indien zijn eigen wet reeds van toepassing is op het feit en het recht op strafvordering op het tijdstip van ontvangst van het verzoek krachtens die wet reeds is verjaard; in dat geval vindt artikel 26, tweede lid, geen toepassing;  

(g) indien zijn bevoegdheid uitsluitend is gegrond op artikel 2 en het recht op strafvordering op het tijdstip van ontvangst van het verzoek is verjaard krachtens zijn wet, daarbij rekening gehouden met de verlenging van de verjaringstermijn met zes maanden, voorzien in artikel 23;  

(h) indien het feit buiten het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat is begaan;  

(i) indien de strafvervolging in strijd is met de door de aangezochte Staat aangegane internationale verplichtingen;  

(j) indien de vervolging in strijd is met de grondbeginselen van de rechtsorde van de aangezochte Staat;  

(k) indien de verzoekende Staat een in dit Verdrag neergelegde procedureregel heeft overtreden.    

### Artikel  12  

1.  De aangezochte Staat is verplicht zijn aanvaarding van het verzoek in te trekken, indien na die aanvaarding een in artikel 10 van dit Verdrag genoemde grond blijkt te bestaan om geen gevolg te geven aan het verzoek.   
2.  De aangezochte Staat is gerechtigd zijn aanvaarding van het verzoek in te trekken: 

(a) indien blijkt dat de aanwezigheid van de verdachte ter terechtzitting in die Staat niet kan worden verzekerd of indien een eventuele veroordeling in die Staat niet ten uitvoer kan worden gelegd;  

(b) indien een der in artikel 11 genoemde weigeringsgronden zich voordoet alvorens de zaak ter terechtzitting aanhangig is gemaakt; of  

(c) in andere gevallen, indien de verzoekende Staat daarmede instemt.     

### AFDELING  2  

####PROCEDURE VAN OVERDRACHT

### Artikel  13  

1.  De in dit Verdrag bedoelde verzoeken worden schriftelijk gedaan. Zij worden, evenals alle voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag benodigde mededelingen, hetzij door het Ministerie van Justitie van de verzoekende Staat aan het Ministerie van Justitie van de aangezochte Staat, hetzij, krachtens bijzondere overeenkomsten, door de autoriteiten van de verzoekende Staat rechtstreeks aan die van de aangezochte Staat toegezonden en op dezelfde wijze teruggezonden.   
2.  In spoedeisende gevallen kunnen de verzoeken en mededelingen worden gedaan door tussenkomst van de Internationale Politie Organisatie (INTERPOL).   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat kan door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa te richten verklaring te kennen geven, dat hij wat hemzelf betreft wenst af te wijken van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel neergelegde regels voor de overdracht.   

### Artikel  14  

Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat van oordeel is dat de door een andere Verdragsluitende Staat verstrekte inlichtingen onvoldoende zijn om hem in staat te stellen dit Verdrag toe te passen, vraagt hij de nodige aanvullende gegevens. Hij kan een termijn stellen waarbinnen die gegevens moeten zijn ontvangen.  

### Artikel  15  

1.  Het verzoek tot strafvervolging gaat vergezeld van het origineel of een voor gelijkluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift van het strafdossier en van alle ter zake dienende stukken. Indien evenwel een verdachte krachtens de bepalingen van Afdeling 5 in voorlopige hechtenis is gesteld en de verzoekende Staat niet in staat is de genoemde stukken bij het verzoek tot strafvervolging te voegen, kunnen deze naderhand worden toegezonden.   
2.  De verzoekende Staat doet de aangezochte Staat schriftelijk mededeling van alle processuele handelingen en alle maatregelen die in de verzoekende Staat na de overlegging van het verzoek hebben plaatsgevonden en betrekking hebben op de strafvervolging. Deze mededeling dient vergezeld te gaan van alle ter zake dienende documenten.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  De aangezochte Staat deelt de verzoekende Staat onverwijld zijn beslissing op het verzoek tot strafvervolging mede.   
2.  De aangezochte Staat stelt de verzoekende Staat op de hoogte van het staken van strafvervolging of de als resultaat van de procedure gegeven beslissing. Een voor gelijkluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift van elke schriftelijke beslissing wordt de verzoekende Staat toegezonden.   

### Artikel  17  

Indien de bevoegdheid van de aangezochte Staat uitsluitend is gegrond op artikel 2 verwittigt die Staat de verdachte van het verzoek tot strafvervolging, opdat deze zijn beschouwing kan geven alvorens die Staat een beslissing neemt aangaande het verzoek.  

### Artikel  18  

1.  Behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede lid van dit artikel wordt een vertaling van de documenten met betrekking tot de toepassing van dit Verdrag niet vereist.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat kan zich op het tijdstip van ondertekening of van de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa te richten verklaring het recht voorbehouden te verlangen, dat genoemde stukken, met uitzondering van het afschrift van de in artikel 16, tweede lid, bedoelde schriftelijke beslissing, hem worden toegezonden, vergezeld van een vertaling. De andere Verdragsluitende Staten moeten die vertalingen toezenden, hetzij in de landstaal van de Staat van bestemming, hetzij in een der door de Staat van bestemming aan te wijzen officiële talen van de Raad van Europa. Laatstbedoelde aanwijzing is evenwel niet verplicht. De andere Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen het beginsel van wederkerigheid toepassen.   
3.  Dit artikel laat onverlet de bepalingen betreffende de vertaling van verzoeken en bijlagen, neergelegd in de van kracht zijnde of alsnog te sluiten overeenkomsten of regelingen tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten.   

### Artikel  19  

Met toepassing van dit Verdrag overgelegde documenten zijn vrijgesteld van alle formaliteiten van legalisatie.  

### Artikel  20  

Elk der Verdragsluitende Staten doet tegenover de andere afstand van de terugvordering van uit de toepassing van dit Verdrag voortvloeiende kosten.  

### AFDELING  3  

####GEVOLGEN VAN HET VERZOEK TOT STRAFVERVOLGING IN DE VERZOEKENDE STAAT

### Artikel  21  

1.  Zodra de verzoekende Staat het verzoek tot strafvervolging heeft aangeboden, mag hij de verdachte niet meer vervolgen voor het feit, dat ten grondslag ligt aan het verzoek, noch overgaan tot tenuitvoerlegging van een door hem voordien wegens dat feit tegen de verdachte gewezen vonnis. Evenwel behoudt de verzoekende Staat tot het tijdstip van de mededeling van de beslissing van de aangezochte Staat op het verzoek tot strafvervolging het recht tot daden van vervolging over te gaan, met uitzondering van die waarbij de zaak ter terechtzitting aanhangig wordt gemaakt of eventueel wordt aangebracht voor de bestuurlijke autoriteit die bevoegd is over het strafbare feit te beslissen.   
2.  De verzoekende Staat herkrijgt zijn recht tot strafvervolging of tot tenuitvoerlegging: 

(a) indien de aangezochte Staat hem kennis geeft van zijn op grond van artikel 10 genomen beslissing geen gevolg te geven aan het verzoek;  

(b) indien de aangezochte Staat hem mededeelt dat hij op grond van artikel 11 weigert het verzoek te aanvaarden;  

(c) indien de aangezochte Staat de aanvaarding van het verzoek intrekt in de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 12;  

(d) indien de aangezochte Staat hem mededeling doet van zijn beslissing geen vervolging in te stellen of een ingestelde vervolging te staken;  

(e) indien hij zijn verzoek intrekt voordat de aangezochte Staat hem kennis heeft gegeven van zijn beslissing daaraan gevolg te geven.     

### Artikel  22  

In de verzoekende Staat heeft het verzoek tot het instellen van een vervolging overeenkomstig deze Titel ten gevolge dat de termijn van verjaring van het recht tot strafvordering wordt verlengd met zes maanden.  

### AFDELING  4  

####GEVOLGEN VAN HET VERZOEK TOT STRAFVERVOLGING IN DE AANGEZOCHTE STAAT

### Artikel  23  

Indien de bevoegdheid van de aangezochte Staat uitsluitend is gegrond op artikel 2 wordt de termijn van verjaring van het recht van strafvordering verlengd met zes maanden.  

### Artikel  24  

1.  Indien het feit in de beide Staten alleen op klachte vervolgbaar is, geldt de in de verzoekende Staat ingediende klacht ook als zodanig in de aangezochte Staat.   
2.  Indien een klacht slechts in de aangezochte Staat vereist is, kan die Staat overgaan tot strafvervolging, zelfs bij ontbreken van de klacht, mits de persoon die gerechtigd is de klacht in te dienen zich daartegen niet heeft verzet binnen een termijn van een maand te rekenen van de dag van ontvangst van de kennisgeving, waardoor de bevoegde autoriteit hem van dit recht tot verzet op de hoogte heeft gesteld.   

### Artikel  25  

In de aangezochte Staat is de op het strafbare feit toe te passen sanctie die welke is gesteld in de wet van die Staat, tenzij die wet anders bepaalt. Indien de bevoegdheid van de aangezochte Staat uitsluitend is gegrond op artikel 2 kan de opgelegde sanctie in die Staat niet zwaarder zijn dan de sanctie gesteld in de wet van de verzoekende Staat.  

### Artikel  26  

1.  Elke daad van opsporing en vervolging verricht in de verzoekende Staat overeenkomstig de aldaar van kracht zijnde wetten en voorschriften, heeft dezelfde rechtskracht in de aangezochte Staat alsof hij was verricht door de autoriteiten van die Staat. Deze gelijkstelling heeft echter niet tot gevolg dat aan die daad een grotere bewijskracht wordt toegekend dan hij in de verzoekende Staat heeft.   
2.  Elke handeling die de verjaring stuit en die rechtsgeldig is verricht in de verzoekende Staat heeft dezelfde gevolgen in de aangezochte Staat en omgekeerd.   

### AFDELING  5  

####VOORLOPIGE MAATREGELEN IN DE AANGEZOCHTE STAAT

### Artikel  27  

1.  Indien de verzoekende Staat zijn voornemen kenbaar maakt tot het doen van een verzoek tot strafvervolging en de bevoegdheid van de aangezochte Staat uitsluitend is gegrond op artikel 2, kan de aangezochte Staat op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat krachtens dit Verdrag overgaan tot de aanhouding van de verdachte, indien: 

(a) de wet van de aangezochte Staat voorlopige hechtenis voor het strafbare feit toelaat, en  

(b) er redenen bestaan om te vrezen dat de verdachte de vlucht neemt of indien gevaar bestaat voor collusie.     
2.  Het verzoek tot aanhouding dient aan te geven dat een bevel tot aanhouding of een andere akte die dezelfde kracht heeft is afgegeven in de door de wet van de verzoekende Staat voorgeschreven vorm; het dient te vermelden: het strafbare feit waarvoor strafvervolging wordt verzocht, het tijdstip waarop en de plaats waar het is begaan, benevens een zo nauwkeurig mogelijk signalement van de verdachte. Het dient tevens een korte omschrijving te bevatten van de feiten.   
3.  Het verzoek tot aanhouding wordt door de in artikel 13 bedoelde autoriteiten van de verzoekende Staat rechtstreeks toegezonden aan de overeenkomstige autoriteiten van de aangezochte Staat, hetzij per brief of telegram, hetzij op enige andere wijze, waarbij schriftelijk van het verzoek blijkt of welke door de aangezochte Staat wordt aanvaard. De verzoekende Staat wordt onverwijld in kennis gesteld van het gevolg dat aan zijn verzoek is gegeven.   

### Artikel  28  

Zodra de aangezochte Staat een verzoek tot strafvervolging heeft ontvangen, vergezeld van de in artikel 15, eerste lid, bedoelde documenten, is hij bevoegd alle voorlopige maatregelen te treffen, met inbegrip van het in voorlopige hechtenis stellen van de verdachte en de inbeslagneming, die krachtens zijn wet zouden mogen worden toegepast, indien het strafbare feit waarvoor strafvervolging is verzocht, op zijn grondgebied zou zijn gepleegd.  

### Artikel  29  

1.  De voorlopige maatregelen bedoeld in de artikelen 27 en 28 worden beheerst door de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en door de wet van de aangezochte Staat. De wet van die Staat of het Verdrag bepaalt eveneens de omstandigheden waaronder deze maatregelen worden opgeheven.   
2.  Deze maatregelen worden opgeheven in alle gevallen bedoeld in artikel 21, tweede lid.   
3.  Een in hechtenis gesteld persoon dient in vrijheid te worden gesteld indien hij is aangehouden krachtens artikel 27 en de aangezochte Staat het verzoek tot het instellen van een vervolging niet heeft ontvangen binnen 18 dagen na de datum van de aanhouding.   
4.  Een in hechtenis gesteld persoon dient in vrijheid te worden gesteld indien hij is aangehouden krachtens artikel 27 en de bij het verzoek tot strafvervolging te voegen documenten niet binnen een termijn van 15 dagen na de ontvangst van het verzoek tot strafvervolging zijn ontvangen door de aangezochte Staat.   
5.  De termijn van de uitsluitend krachtens artikel 27 bevolen inhechtenisstelling mag in geen geval langer zijn dan 40 dagen.   

### TITEL  IV  

####Samenloop van strafvervolging

### Artikel  30  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat die, voorafgaande aan of tijdens het overgaan tot strafvervolging wegens een strafbaar feit dat door hem geacht wordt geen politiek of zuiver militair karakter te bezitten, kennis draagt van een in een andere Verdragsluitende Staat ingestelde strafvervolging tegen dezelfde persoon wegens dezelfde feiten, dient te overwegen of hij hetzij de door hem ingestelde strafvervolging zal staken of schorsen, hetzij haar zal overdragen aan de andere Staat.   
2.  Indien hij het in deze omstandigheden raadzaam acht de door hem ingestelde strafvervolging niet te staken of te schorsen geeft hij daarvan aan de andere Staat tijdig kennis en in elk geval alvorens uitspraak ten principale is gewezen.   

### Artikel  31  

1.  In het in artikel 30, tweede lid, bedoelde geval trachten de belanghebbende Staten, na beoordeling in elk geval van de in artikel 8 genoemde omstandigheden, zoveel mogelijk vast te stellen aan wie van hen de taak toevalt om een enkele strafvervolging voort te zetten. Tijdens dit overleg stellen de belanghebbende Staten een uitspraak ten principale uit, zonder evenwel verplicht te zijn dit uitstel te verlengen tot een termijn langer dan 30 dagen na de verzending van de in artikel 30, tweede lid, bedoelde kennisgeving.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het eerste lid is niet bindend: 

(a) voor de Staat die de in artikel 30, tweede lid, bedoelde kennisgeving heeft verzonden, indien de terechtzitting ten principale in tegenwoordigheid van de verdachte is geopend vóór de verzending van de kennisgeving;  

(b) voor de Staat van bestemming der kennisgeving indien de terechtzitting in tegenwoordigheid van de verdachte is geopend vóór de ontvangst van die kennisgeving.     

### Artikel  32  

In het belang van de waarheidsvinding en de straftoemeting dienen de betrokken Staten na te gaan of het aanbeveling verdient dat een van hen een enkele strafvervolging instelt, indien: 

(a) verscheidene zakelijk verschillende feiten, die alle strafbaar zijn volgens het strafrecht van elk van die Staten, worden toegeschreven hetzij aan een enkele persoon, hetzij aan verschillende personen die gezamenlijk hebben gehandeld.  

(b) een enkel feit, dat een strafbaar feit is volgens het strafrecht van elk van die Staten, wordt toegeschreven aan verschillende personen, die gezamenlijk hebben gehandeld; in het bevestigende geval bepalen zij tevens wie van hen de strafvervolging instelt.    

### Artikel  33  

Elke beslissing genomen overeenkomstig artikel 31, eerste lid, en artikel 32 brengt voor de betrokken Staten alle gevolgen mede van een overdracht van strafvervolging, zoals die is voorzien in dit Verdrag. De Staat die zijn eigen strafvervolging staakt, wordt geacht zijn strafvervolging te hebben overgedragen aan een andere Staat.  

### Artikel  34  

De procedure van overdracht bedoeld in de 2e Afdeling van Titel III wordt toegepast in zoverre haar bepalingen verenigbaar zijn met deze Titel.  

### TITEL  V  

####Ne bis in idem

### Artikel  35  

1.  Hij die bij een onherroepelijk en voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar strafvonnis is veroordeeld, kan niet voor hetzelfde feit worden vervolgd, veroordeeld of onderworpen aan de tenuitvoerlegging van een sanctie in een andere Verdragsluitende Staat: 

(a) indien hij is vrijgesproken;  

(b) indien de opgelegde sanctie: 

(i) geheel is ondergaan of nog steeds ten uitvoer wordt gelegd, of  

(ii) geheel of wat het nog niet ten uitvoer gelegde gedeelte betreft bij wege van gratie of amnestie is kwijtgescholden of  

(iii) niet meer ten uitvoer kan worden gelegd omdat zij is verjaard;    

(c) indien de rechter de dader van het strafbare feit schuldig heeft verklaard zonder oplegging van een sanctie.     
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat is echter, tenzij hij zelf om vervolging heeft verzocht, niet verplicht de gevolgen van het *ne bis in idem* te erkennen, indien het feit dat aanleiding heeft gegeven tot het vonnis begaan is tegen een tot de openbare dienst van die Staat behorende persoon, instelling of zaak, of indien de persoon tegen wie het vonnis is gewezen zelf tot de openbare dienst van die Staat behoorde.   
3.  Bovendien is de Verdragsluitende Staat waar het feit is begaan, dan wel volgens de wet van die Staat wordt geacht te zijn begaan, niet verplicht de gevolgen van het *ne bis in idem* te erkennen, tenzij hij zelf om de vervolging heeft gevraagd.   

### Artikel  36  

Indien een nieuwe vervolging wordt ingesteld tegen een persoon die voor hetzelfde feit reeds in een andere Verdragsluitende Staat is veroordeeld, wordt iedere periode van vrijheidsbeneming, ondergaan bij de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis, in mindering gebracht op de eventueel op te leggen sanctie.  

### Artikel  37  

Deze Titel vormt geen beletsel voor de toepassing van ruimere nationale bepalingen waardoor aan buitenlandse rechterlijke beslissingen *ne bis in idem* -werking wordt toegekend.  

### TITEL  VI  

####Slotbepalingen

2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan op het ogenblik van nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding, of op elk later tijdstip door middel van een verklaring, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, de toepassing van dit Verdrag uitbreiden tot ieder ander in de verklaring aangegeven grondgebied, voor welks internationale betrekkingen hij verantwoordelijk is of voor hetwelk hij bevoegd is verbintenissen aan te gaan.

2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan een voorbehoud of verklaring, door hem gemaakt krachtens het voorgaande lid, geheel of gedeeltelijk intrekken door middel van een verklaring, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, welke verklaring van kracht wordt op de datum van ontvangst.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Staat die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt met betrekking tot een bepaling van dit Verdrag mag de naleving van deze bepaling door een andere Verdragsluitende Staat niet eisen; hij kan echter, als zijn voorbehoud beperkt of voorwaardelijk is, de naleving van de bepaling eisen voor zover hij zich daaraan gebonden heeft.   

### Artikel  42  

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan op ieder ogenblik door middel van een verklaring, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, de wettelijke bepalingen aanwijzen die opgenomen moeten worden in Bijlage III van dit Verdrag.

### Artikel  43
