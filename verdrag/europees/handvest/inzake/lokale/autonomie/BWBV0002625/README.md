##Europees Handvest inzake lokale autonomie

####European Charter of local self-government

PREAMBLE  

The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage; Considering that one of the methods by which this aim is to be achieved is through agreements in the administrative field; Considering that the local authorities are one of the main foundations of any democratic regime; Considering that the right of citizens to participate in the conduct of public affairs is one of the democratic principles that are shared by all member States of the Council of Europe; Convinced that it is at local level that this right can be most directly exercised; Convinced that the existence of local authorities with real responsibilities can provide an administration which is both effective and close to the citizen; Aware that the safeguarding and reinforcement of local self-government in the different European countries is an important contribution to the construction of a Europe based on the principles of democracy and the decentralisation of power; Asserting that this entails the existence of local authorities endowed with democratically constituted decision-making bodies and possessing a wide degree of autonomy with regard to their responsibilities, the ways and means by which those responsibilities are exercised and the resources required for their fulfilment, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

The Parties undertake to consider themselves bound by the following articles in the manner and to the extent prescribed in Article 12 of this Charter.  

### PART  I  

### Article  2  

####Constitutional and legal foundation for local self-government

The principle of local self-government shall be recognised in domestic legislation, and where practicable in the constitution.  

### Article  3  

####Concept of local self-government

1.  Local self-government denotes the right and the ability of local authorities, within the limits of the law, to regulate and manage a substantial share of public affairs under their own responsibility and in the interests of the local population.   
2.  This right shall be exercised by councils or assemblies composed of members freely elected by secret ballot on the basis of direct, equal, universal suffrage, and which may possess executive organs responsible to them. This provision shall in no way affect recourse to assemblies of citizens, referendums or any other form of direct citizen participation where it is permitted by statute.   

### Article  4  

####Scope of local self-government

1.  The basic powers and responsibilities of local authorities shall be prescribed by the constitution or by statute. However, this provision shall not prevent the attribution to local authorities of powers and responsibilities for specific purposes in accordance with the law.   
2.  Local authorities shall, within the limits of the law, have full discretion to exercise their initiative with regard to any matter which is not excluded from their competence nor assigned to any other authority.   
3.  Public responsibilities shall generally be exercised, in preference, by those authorities which are closest to the citizen. Allocation of responsibility to another authority should weigh up the extent and nature of the task and requirements of efficiency and economy.   
4.  Powers given to local authorities shall normally be full and exclusive. They may not be undermined or limited by another, central or regional, authority except as provided for by the law.   
5.  Where powers are delegated to them by a central or regional authority, local authorities shall, insofar as possible, be allowed discretion in adapting their exercise to local conditions.   
6.  Local authorities shall be consulted, insofar as possible, in due time and in an appropriate way in the planning and decision-making processes for all matters which concern them directly.   

### Article  5  

####Protection of local authority boundaries

Changes in local authority boundaries shall not be made without prior consultation of the local communities concerned, possibly by means of a referendum where this is permitted by statute.  

### Article  6  

####Appropriate administrative structures and resources for the tasks of local authorities

1.  Without prejudice to more general statutory provisions, local authorities shall be able to determine their own internal administrative structures in order to adapt them to local needs and ensure effective management.   
2.  The conditions of service of local government employees shall be such as to permit the recruitment of high-quality staff on the basis of merit and competence; to this end adequate training opportunities, remuneration and career prospects shall be provided.   

### Article  7  

####Conditions under which responsibilities at local level are exercised

1.  The conditions of office of local elected representatives shall provide for free exercise of their functions.   
2.  They shall allow for appropriate financial compensation for expenses incurred in the exercise of the office in question as well as, where appropriate, compensation for loss of earnings or remuneration for work done and corresponding social welfare protection.   
3.  Any functions and activities which are deemed imcompatible with the holding of local elective office shall be determined by statute or fundamental legal principles.   

### Article  8  

####Administrative supervision of local authorities' activities

1.  Any administrative supervision of local authorities may only be exercised according to such procedures and in such cases as are provided for by the constitution or by statute.   
2.  Any administrative supervision of the activities of the local authorities shall normally aim only at ensuring compliance with the law and with constitutional principles. Administrative supervision may however be exercised with regard to expediency by higher-level authorities in respect of tasks the execution of which is delegated to local authorities.   
3.  Administrative supervision of local authorities shall be exercised in such a way as to ensure that the intervention of the controlling authority is kept in proportion to the importance of the interests which it is intended to protect.   

### Article  9  

####Financial resources of local authorities

1.  Local authorities shall be entitled, within national economic policy, to adequate financial resources of their own, of which they may dispose freely within the framework of their powers.   
2.  Local authorities' financial resources shall be commensurate with the responsibilities provided for by the constitution and the law.   
3.  Part at least of the financial resources of local authorities shall derive from local taxes and charges of which, within the limits of statute, they have the power to determine the rate.   
4.  The financial systems on which resources available to local authorities are based shall be of a sufficiently diversified and buoyant nature to enable them to keep pace as far as practically possible with the real evolution of the cost of carrying out their tasks.   
5.  The protection of financially weaker local authorities calls for the institution of financial equalisation procedures or equivalent measures which are designed to correct the effects of the unequal distribution of potential sources of finance and of the financial burden they must support. Such procedures or measures shall not diminish the discretion local authorities may exercise within their own sphere of responsibility.   
6.  Local authorities shall be consulted, in an appropriate manner, on the way in which redistributed resources are to be allocated to them.   
7.  As far as possible, grants to local authorities shall not be earmarked for the financing of specific projects. The provision of grants shall not remove the basic freedom of local authorities to exercise policy discretion within their own jurisdiction.   
8.  For the purpose of borrowing for capital investment, local authorities shall have access to the national capital market within the limits of the law.   

### Article  10  

####Local authorities' right to associate

1.  Local authorities shall be entitled, in exercising their powers, to co-operate and, within the framework of the law, to form consortia with other local authorities in order to carry out tasks of common interest.   
2.  The entitlement of local authorities to belong to an association for the protection and promotion of their common interests and to belong to an international association of local authorities shall be recognised in each State.   
3.  Local authorities shall be entitled, under such conditions as may be provided for by the law, to co-operate with their counterparts in other States.   

### Article  11  

####Legal protection of local self-government

Local authorities shall have the right of recourse to a judicial remedy in order to secure free exercise of their powers and respect for such principles of local self-government as are enshrined in the constitution or domestic legislation.

####Europees Handvest inzake lokale autonomie

PREAMBULE  

De Lidstaten van de Raad van Europa die dit Handvest hebben ondertekend, Overwegende dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn leden, ten einde de idealen en beginselen, die hun gemeenschappelijk erfdeel zijn, te beschermen en te verwezenlijken; Overwegende dat één van de wijzen waarop dit doel tot stand dient te worden gebracht, is door overeenkomsten op het bestuurlijk vlak te sluiten; Overwegende dat de lokale autoriteiten één van de belangrijkste grondslagen van elk democratisch regime zijn; Overwegende dat het recht van burgers deel te nemen aan het openbaar bestuur een van de democratische beginselen is die alle lidstaten van de Raad van Europa gemeen hebben; Ervan overtuigd dat dit recht op lokaal niveau op de meest rechtstreekse wijze kan worden uitgeoefend; Ervan overtuigd dat het bestaan van lokale autoriteiten met werkelijke verantwoordelijkheden een vorm van bestuur mogelijk maakt die zowel doeltreffend is alsook dicht bij de burgers staat; Zich ervan bewust dat de bescherming en versterking van lokale autonomie in de verschillende Europese landen een belangrijke bijdrage levert tot het ontstaan van een Europa gebaseerd op de beginselen van democratie en decentralisatie van de macht; Verklarend dat dit het bestaan van lokale autoriteiten noodzakelijk maakt die beschikken over op democratische wijze tot stand gekomen besluitvormende organen, die in hoge mate autonoom zijn met betrekking tot hun bevoegdheden, de wijze waarop deze bevoegdheden worden uitgeoefend en de financiën die voor deze uitoefening vereist zijn, Zijn als volgt overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

De Partijen verbinden zich ertoe zich gebonden te achten door de volgende artikelen op de wijze en in de mate als is voorgeschreven in artikel 12 van dit Handvest.  

### DEEL  I  

### Artikel  2  

####Grondwettelijke en wettelijke grondslag voor lokale autonomie

Het beginsel van lokale autonomie dient te worden erkend in de interne wetgeving en waar mogelijk in de grondwet.  

### Artikel  3  

####Het begrip lokale autonomie

1.  Lokale autonomie houdt in het recht en het vermogen van lokale autoriteiten, binnen de grenzen van de wet, een belangrijk deel van de openbare aangelegenheden krachtens hun eigen verantwoordelijkheid en in het belang van de plaatselijke bevolking te regelen en te beheren.   
2.  Dit recht wordt uitgeoefend door raden of vergaderingen waarvan de leden zijn gekozen door middel van vrije, geheime, op gelijkheid berustende, rechtstreekse en algemene verkiezingen, en die over uitvoerende organen kunnen beschikken die aan hen verantwoording zijn verschuldigd. Deze bepaling staat op geen enkele wijze in de weg aan het houden van vergaderingen van burgers, aan een referendum, dan wel aan enige andere vorm van rechtstreekse deelname van de burgers waar dit is toegestaan bij wet.   

### Artikel  4  

####Reikwijdte van de lokale autonomie

1.  De fundamentele bevoegdheden en verantwoordelijkheden van de lokale autoriteiten worden bij de grondwet of bij wet vastgesteld. Deze bepaling verhindert evenwel niet de attributie aan de lokale autoriteiten van bevoegdheden voor bepaalde doeleinden overeenkomstig de wet.   
2.  De lokale autoriteiten bezitten, binnen de grenzen van de wet, volledige vrijheid van handelen ten einde hun bevoegdheden uit te oefenen met betrekking tot elke zaak die niet aan hun bevoegdheid is onttrokken of aan enige andere autoriteit is toegewezen.   
3.  Overheidsverantwoordelijkheden dienen in het algemeen bij voorkeur door die autoriteiten te worden uitgeoefend die het dichtst bij de burgers staan. Bij toekenning van verantwoordelijkheid aan een andere autoriteit dient rekening te worden gehouden met de omvang en de aard van de taak en de eisen van doelmatigheid en kostenbesparing.   
4.  Bevoegdheden die aan lokale autoriteiten zijn toegekend dienen in de regel volledig en uitsluitend te zijn. Zij mogen niet worden aangetast of beperkt door een andere, centrale of regionale, autoriteit, behalve voor zover bij of krachtens de wet is bepaald.   
5.  Waar bevoegdheden door een centrale of regionale autoriteit aan hen worden gedelegeerd dient de lokale autoriteiten zoveel mogelijk vrijheid van handelen te worden toegestaan bij het aanpassen van hun beleid aan de plaatselijke omstandigheden.   
6.  De lokale autoriteiten dienen, voor zover mogelijk, tijdig en op gepaste wijze te worden geraadpleegd over de planning en de besluitvormingsprocedures aangaande alle zaken die hen rechtstreeks raken.   

### Artikel  5  

####Bescherming van de territoriale grenzen van de lokale autoriteiten

Wijzigingen van plaatselijke gebiedsgrenzen worden niet aangebracht zonder vooraf de desbetreffende plaatselijke gemeenschappen te raadplegen, zo mogelijk door middel van een referendum, waar dit wettelijk is toegestaan.  

### Artikel  6  

####Passende administratieve structuren en middelen ten behoeve van lokale autoriteiten

1.  Onverminderd meer algemene wettelijke bepalingen kunnen de lokale autoriteiten hun eigen administratieve structuur vaststellen ten einde deze aan de plaatselijke behoeften aan te passen en een doelmatig bestuur te verzekeren.   
2.  De rechtspositie van personeel bij lokale autoriteiten dient zodanig te zijn dat zij het mogelijk maakt kwalitatief hoogstaand personeel aan te nemen op basis van verdienste en bekwaamheid; hiertoe dienen voldoende opleidingsmogelijkheden, bezoldiging en carrièremogelijkheden te worden geboden.   

### Artikel  7  

####Voorwaarden waaronder verantwoordelijkheden op lokaal niveau uitgeoefend worden

1.  De rechtspositie van gekozen lokale vertegenwoordigers dient de vrije uitoefening van hun functies te waarborgen.   
2.  Zij voorziet in een passende financiële vergoeding van de kosten gemaakt in de uitoefening van het mandaat evenals, in voorkomende gevallen, in vergoeding voor het verlies van inkomsten of beloning van de verrichte arbeid en in de daarmee verband houdende sociale voorzieningen.   
3.  De functies en activiteiten welke onverenigbaar worden geacht met het bekleden van een ambt waarvoor men lokaal gekozen is, worden vastgelegd in de wet of fundamentele rechtsbeginselen.   

### Artikel  8  

####Administratief toezicht op de activiteiten van de lokale autoriteiten

1.  Elk administratief toezicht op de lokale autoriteiten mag slechts worden uitgeoefend overeenkomstig de procedures en in de gevallen, waarin door de grondwet of de wet is voorzien.   
2.  Elk administratief toezicht op de activiteiten van de lokale autoriteiten dient in de regel slechts gericht te zijn op het verzekeren van de naleving van de wet en de grondwettelijke beginselen. Administratief toezicht mag echter met betrekking tot doelmatigheid door hogere autoriteiten uitgeoefend worden inzake taken waarvan de uitoefening aan de lokale autoriteiten is gedelegeerd.   
3.  Administratief toezicht op lokale autoriteiten dient zodanig te worden uitgeoefend dat er sprake is van evenredigheid tussen de interventie van de toezichthoudende autoriteit en de belangen die deze beoogt te dienen.   

### Artikel  9  

####Financiële middelen van lokale overheden

1.  De lokale autoriteiten hebben binnen het kader van het nationale economische beleid, recht op voldoende eigen financiële middelen, waarover zij vrijelijk kunnen beschikken bij de uitoefening van hun bevoegdheden.   
2.  De financiële middelen van de lokale autoriteiten dienen evenredig te zijn aan de bevoegdheden zoals die zijn vastgelegd in de grondwet of de wet.   
3.  Ten minste een deel van de financiële middelen van de lokale autoriteiten dient te worden verkregen uit lokale belastingen en heffingen waarover zij, binnen de grenzen bij de wet gesteld, de bevoegdheid hebben de hoogte vast te stellen.   
4.  De financieringsstelsels op basis waarvan lokale autoriteiten middelen ter beschikking krijgen, dienen voldoende gevarieerd van aard te zijn en groeicapaciteit te hebben om hen in staat te stellen gelijke tred te houden, zoveel als in de praktijk mogelijk is, met de werkelijke groei van de kosten van het uitvoeren van hun taken.   
5.  De bescherming van de financieel zwakkere lokale autoriteiten vereist de instelling van procedures om financiële middelen evenredig te verdelen of van gelijkwaardige maatregelen, die bedoeld zijn de gevolgen te corrigeren van een ongelijke verdeling van potentiële financieringsbronnen en van de financiële lasten die deze moeten dragen. Dergelijke procedures of maatregelen mogen de vrijheid van keuze, die de lokale autoriteiten hebben binnen het kader van hun eigen verantwoordelijkheid, niet beperken.   
6.  De lokale autoriteiten worden op gepaste wijze geraadpleegd over de manier waarop de herverdeelde middelen aan hen zullen worden toegewezen.   
7.  Voor zover mogelijk, dienen subsidies aan lokale autoriteiten niet bestemd te worden ter financiering van specifieke projecten. De toewijzing van subsidies dient de fundamentele vrijheid van de lokale autoriteiten een eigen beleid te voeren binnen de grenzen van hun eigen competentie niet te belemmeren.   
8.  Ten einde te kunnen lenen voor kapitaalsinvesteringen dienen de lokale autoriteiten, binnen de grenzen bij de wet gesteld, toegang tot de nationale kapitaalmarkt te hebben.   

### Artikel  10  

####Het recht van de lokale autoriteiten zich te organiseren

1.  De lokale autoriteiten hebben het recht, bij de uitoefening van hun bevoegdheden, samen te werken en, binnen het kader van de wet, zich te verenigen met andere lokale autoriteiten ten einde taken van gemeenschappelijk belang uit te voeren.   
2.  Het recht van de lokale autoriteiten tot een organisatie te behoren ter bescherming en bevordering van hun gemeenschappelijke belangen en lid te zijn van een internationale organisatie van lokale autoriteiten dient door iedere Staat te worden erkend.   
3.  De lokale autoriteiten hebben onder voorwaarden welke de wet kan stellen, het recht samen te werken met autoriteiten in andere Staten.   

### Artikel  11  

####Wettelijke bescherming van lokale autonomie

De lokale autoriteiten hebben het recht rechtsmiddelen aan te wenden ten einde de zelfstandige uitoefening van hun bevoegdheden te verzekeren alsmede de eerbiediging van die beginselen van lokale autonomie die zijn vastgelegd in de grondwet of de interne wetgeving.
