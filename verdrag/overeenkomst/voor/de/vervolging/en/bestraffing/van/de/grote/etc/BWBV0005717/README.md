London, 8th August, 1945. Whereas the United Nations have from time to time made declarations of their intention that War Criminals shall be brought to justice; And whereas the Moscow Declaration of the 30th October, 1943, on German atrocities in Occupied Europe stated that those German officers and men and members of the Nazi Party who have been responsible for or have taken a consenting part in atrocities and crimes will be sent back to the countries in which their abominable deeds were done in order that they may be judged and punished according to the laws of these liberated countries and of the free Governments that will be created therein; And whereas this Declaration was stated to be without prejudice to the case of major criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by the joint decision of the Governments of the Allies; Now therefore the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Government of the United States of America, the Provisional Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (hereinafter called „the Signatories”) acting in the interests of all the United Nations and by their representatives duly authorised thereto have concluded this Agreement.

### Artikel  3  

Noch de Rechtbank noch haar leden noch hun plaatsvervangers kunnen door het Openbaar Ministerie of door de verdachten of hun raadslieden worden gewraakt.

Het beginsel van rouleering van het voorzitterschap voor opeenvolgende processen wordt aanvaard. Indien echter een zitting van de Rechtbank plaats heeft op het grondgebied van één van de vier Onderteekenaars, zal de vertegenwoordiger van dien Onderteekenaar in de Rechtbank presideeren.

De Rechtbank, die door de Overeenkomst bedoeld in art. 1 wordt ingesteld voor de berechting en bestraffing van de groote oorlogsmisdadigers van de landen van de Europeesche As, zal de bevoegdheid hebben personen te berechten en te bestraffen, die, handelende in het belang van de landen van de Europeesche As, hetzij individueel, hetzij als leden van organisaties, een van de volgende misdrijven hebben begaan. De volgende handelingen, of een van deze, zijn misdrijven, die vallen binnen de rechtsmacht van de Rechtbank en waarvoor individueele aansprakelijkheid zal bestaan: 

(a) *Misdrijven tegen den vrede:* namelijk het maken van plannen voor, het voorbereiden van, het nemen van initiatief tot of het voeren van een aanvalsoorlog of een oorlog in strijd met internationale verdragen, overeenkomsten of verzekeringen, of deelneming aan een gemeenschappelijk plan of samenzwering voor het verrichten van een van de bovengenoemde handelingen;  

(b) *Oorlogsmisdrijven:* namelijk schendingen van de wetten of gebruiken van den oorlog. Zoodanige schendingen zullen omvatten, doch niet beperkt zijn tot moord, mishandeling, of deportatie, met het oog op slavenarbeid of voor eenig ander doel, van de burgerbevolking van of in bezet grondgebied, moord of mishandeling van krijgsgevangenen of van personen op zee, het dooden van gijzelaars, plundering van openbaren of particulieren eigendom, willekeurige vernietiging van steden, plaatsen of dorpen, of verwoesting, welke niet door militaire noodzaak gerechtvaardigd was;  

(c) *Misdrijven tegen de menschelijkheid:* namelijk moord, uitroeiing, het in slavernij voeren, deportatie en andere onmenschelijke handelingen, die vóór of gedurende den oorlog bedreven zijn tegen burgerbevolking; of vervolgingen op grond van politiek, ras of godsdienst ter uitvoering van of in verband met eenig misdrijf behoorende tot de rechtsmacht van de Rechtbank, onverschillig of deze geschiedden al dan niet in strijd met het nationale recht van het land, waar deze daden werden bedreven.

### Artikel  7  

De officieele positie van de verdachten, hetzij als Staatshoofden, hetzij als verantwoordelijke ambtenaren in Regeeringsdepartementen, zal niet geacht worden deze personen te bevrijden van hun aansprakelijkheid of als een reden tot verlichting van hun straf gelden.  

### Artikel  8  

Het feit, dat de verdachte heeft gehandeld krachtens een bevel van zijn Regeering of van een boven hem gestelden, zal hem niet bevrijden van zijn aansprakelijkheid, doch zal kunnen worden beschouwd als reden tot verzachting van zijn straf, indien de Rechtbank beslist, dat de rechtvaardigheid zulks vereischt.  

### Artikel  9  

Bij het proces van een individueel lid van een groep of organisatie kan de Rechtbank verklaren (in verband met eenige handeling, waaraan de persoon kan worden schuldig bevonden), dat de groep of organisatie, waarvan de persoon lid was, een misdadige organisatie was. Na ontvangst van de telastelegging zal de Rechtbank op de wijze als zij gewenscht oordeelt bekend maken, dat het Openbaar Ministerie het voornemen heeft aan de Rechtbank te verzoeken, een zoodanige verklaring te geven en ieder lid van de organisatie zal alsdan bevoegd zijn aan de Rechtbank toestemming te vragen om door haar gehoord te worden omtrent de vraag van het misdadige karakter van de organisatie. De Rechtbank zal de bevoegdheid hebben deze aanvrage toe te staan of af te wijzen. Indien de aanvrage wordt toegestaan, kan de Rechtbank bepalen, op welke wijze de aanvragers zullen worden vertegenwoordigd en gehoord.  

### Artikel  10  

In gevallen, waarin een groep of organisatie door de Rechtbank wordt verklaard misdadig te zijn, zal de bevoegde nationale autoriteit van ieder der Onderteekenaars het recht hebben, personen voor nationale of militaire rechtbanken of rechtbanken van een bezetter te doen berechten op grond van hun lidmaatschap van zoodanige groep of organisatie. In ieder zoodanig geval wordt het misdadige karakter van de groep of organisatie geacht te zijn bewezen en zal niet meer betwist kunnen worden.  

### Artikel  11  

Een persoon, die door de Rechtbank is schuldig bevonden, kan voor een nationale of militaire rechtbank of een rechtbank van een bezetter als bedoeld in art. 10 van dit Handvest worden beschuldigd van een ander misdrijf dan dat van lidmaatschap van een misdadige groep of organisatie, en deze laatste rechtbank kan hem, na hem schuldig te hebben bevonden, een straf opleggen, die onafhankelijk is van en wordt toegevoegd aan de straf, waartoe de Rechtbank hem heeft veroordeeld wegens deelneming aan de misdadige handelingen van een zoodanige groep of organisatie.  

### Artikel  12  

De Rechtbank zal het recht hebben de strafzaak tegen een persoon, beschuldigd van misdrijven als aangegeven in art. 6 van dit Handvest, in zijn afwezigheid te behandelen, indien hij niet gevonden is of indien de Rechtbank om een of andere reden het in het belang van het recht noodzakelijk oordeelt om het verhoor in zijn afwezigheid te doen plaats hebben.
