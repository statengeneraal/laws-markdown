### Protocol  

At the time of signing the Agreement on Economic Cooperation between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have, in addition, agreed on the following understanding which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Agreement: 
### *Re Article 2 (maritime affairs)* 

Whilst recognizing the principle of the free participation of sea-going vessels of whatever nationality in international traffic, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia wishes to make clear that certain temporary measures to further the maritime activities, are a consequence of the necessity to develop the Indonesian merchant marine. 
### *Re Article 5* 

(1) Whilst recognizing the principle that the treatment of Netherlands investments shall in no case be less favourable to the investors than the treatment of its own nationals, the Indonesian Government reserves its position with regard to national treatment of Netherlands investments in view of the present stage of development of the Indonesian national economy. The Indonesian Government shall endeavour to the best of its ability to assure national treatment of Netherlands investors. However, as a reflection of recent developments, foreign owned and Indonesian owned businesses presently do not share identical rights, the Foreign Capital Investment Law differing from the Domestic Capital Investment Law. In no case shall treatment of Netherlands investments be less favourable than Law no. 1 of 1967 permits. When, pursuant to present or subsequent legislation, the Indonesian Government extends additional advantages to Indonesian investors, the Indonesian Government shall, in order to ensure fair and equitable treatment, grant identical or compensating facilities to Netherlands investors engaged in similar economic activities.  

(2) With regard to the employment of foreign managerial, commercial or technical staff-personnel in an enterprise, in case such employment is subject to a licence according to the national legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which such enterprise will be established or is run, that Contracting Party will adopt a lenient attitude when deciding on applications for such licences, taking into account the importance of a just personnel-policy in the framework of the general management of an enterprise.   
### *Re Articles 10 and 11* 

The applicability of the obligations laid down in Article 11 shall, in derogation of Article 10, commence on the date of the entry into force of the present Agreement, it being understood that before that date Indonesia shall have ratified the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965.   
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Representatives have signed the present Protocol. DONE at Djakarta, in duplicate, in the English language, this seventh day of July 1968.  *For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,*  (sd.) J. LUNS  *For the Government of the Republic of Indonesia,*  (sd.) A. MALIK  

### Nr.  I  

The Hague, June 17, 1968. Dear Mr. Thajeb, With reference to the Agreement on Economic Cooperation between the Republic of Indonesia an the Kingdom of the Netherlands, initialed to-day, I have the honour to request your attention for the following. During the preparatory talks, relating to the above-mentioned agreement it was explained to me that, although Indonesia is, as the Netherlands, member of the Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, no law is in force in Indonesia, which protects inventions. Recently however a project of law on this subject has been introduced with the Indonesian Parliament. Pending the enactment of this law, applications for registration on a provisional basis of patents for inventions can be introduced with the Department of Justice, according to the Publication by the Minister of Justice, dated November 1, 1953. Provisional applications which are duly registered will be granted precedence after the law comes into force. After the entry into force, the registrations will be made public. I explained to you that the absence of protection of inventions creates a situation of uncertainty which may hamper the application of new inventions or improved techniques by Netherlands investors into Indonesia. In view thereof I would appreciate it very much if you would draw the attention of the Authorities concerned to the desirability of expediting as much as possible the procedure leading to the coming into force of the above-mentioned law. Yours sincerely, (sd.) VAN OORSCHOT  *Mr.Ismael M. Thajeb*   *Chairman of the Indonesian*   *Delegation*    

### II  

The Hague, June 17, 1968. Dear Dr. van Oorschot, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your to-day's letter, reading as follows:  (zoals in Nr. I)  I have the honour to confirm that I will draw the attention of my Authorities to the desirability of expediting as much as possible the procedure leading to the coming into force of the above-mentioned law. Yours sincerely, ISMAEL M. THAJEB  *Dr. W. P. H. van Oorschot*   *Chairman of the Netherlands*   *Delegation*    

### III  

The Hague, June 17, 1968. Dear Mr. Thajeb, In connection with the discussions on the Agreement on Economic Cooperation between the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which we initialed today, and with special reference to Article 2 of this Agreement dealing amongst others with the promotion of cooperation with regard to the appointment of agents and/or representatives, I would like to request your attention for the following. As the situation is at present, the designation of agents in Indonesia by foreign, including Netherlands shipping companies, is subject to governmental regulations which limit the choice amongst five Indonesian shipping companies. Furthermore, the implementation of this regulation, which in itself is considered restrictive by the Netherlands shipping companies, provides that a foreign shipping company, having chosen one of the five officially designated agents, is bound to use that same agent in all ports of Indonesia. The Netherlands shipping companies consider that this situation hampers the efficient development of maritime relations. They urgently request that this situation be modified in such a way so as to allow greater freedom in the choice amongst available agents in the various ports. I would greatly appreciate if you could exercise your good offices to ensure that this request is favourably considered by the Indonesian Authorities entrusted with the implementation of the pertinent regulations. (sd.) VAN OORSCHOT  *Mr. Ismael M. Thajeb*   *Chairman of the Indonesian*   *Delegation*    

### IV  

The Hague, June 17, 1968. Dear Dr. van Oorschot, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your today's letter, reading as follows:  (zoals in Nr. III)  I have the honour to confirm that I will exercise my good offices to ensure that your request will be favourably considered by the Indonesian Authorities, entrusted with the implementation of the pertinent regulations. Yours sincerely, (sd.) ISMAEL M. THAJEB  *Dr. W. P. H. van Oorschot*   *Chairman of the Netherlands*   *Delegation*

### Artikel  21  

Wanneer een aangelegenheid bij zowel deze Overeenkomst als bij een andere internationale overeenkomst die verbindend is voor de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is geregeld, belet niets in deze Overeenkomst een onderdaan van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zich te beroepen op de bepalingen die voor hem het gunstigst zijn.  

### Artikel  22  

1.  Een geschil tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst dat niet op andere wijze kan worden geregeld, wordt op verzoek van een der partijen bij het geschil voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden bestaand scheidsgerecht. Iedere partij benoemt een scheidsman en de aldus benoemde scheidsmannen benoemen samen een derde scheidsman die geen onderdaan van een der partijen is.   
2.  Indien een der partijen geen scheidsman heeft benoemden indien zij geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere partij binnen twee maanden tot deze benoeming over te gaan, wordt de scheidsman op verzoek van laatstbedoelde partij benoemd door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof.   
3.  Indien de twee scheidsmannen binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming niet tot overeenstemming kunnen geraken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, wordt deze op verzoek van een der partijen benoemd door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof.   
4.  Indien in de gevallen genoemd in het tweede en het derde lid van dit artikel, de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen of indien hij onderdaan is van een der partijen, geschieden de noodzakelijke benoemingen door de Vice-President.

5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op de grondslag van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst overeenkomstig de beginselen van het recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen kan het scheidsgerecht, in ieder stadium van de procedure, een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de partijen voorstellen. De bovenstaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan de bevoegdheid van het scheidsgerecht om een uitspraak *ex aequo et bono* te doen wanneer partijen aldus overeenkomen.

2.  Tenzij een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen twaalf maanden voor het verstrijken van het lopende tijdvak mededeling van beëindiging heeft gedaan, wordt de geldigheidsduur van deze Overeenkomst beschouwd als zijnde stilzwijgend met een nieuw tijdvak van 15 jaar te zijn verlengd.   

### Artikel  26  

De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen de onderhavige Overeenkomst voorlopig toepassen, te rekenen van de datum harer ondertekening.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekende Vertegenwoordigers, daartoe behoorlijk gemachtigd, deze Overeenkomst hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te Djakarta, de zevende juli 1968, in tweevoud in de Engelse taal.  *Voor de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden*  (w.g.) J. LUNS  *Voor de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië*  (w.g.) A. MALIK  

### Protocol  

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst inzake Economische Samenwerking tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië hebben de ondergetekende gevolmachtigden tevens overeenstemming bereikt over de volgende regeling, die als integrerend deel van de genoemde Overeenkomst dient te worden beschouwd: 
### *Ad artikel 2 (zeescheepvaart)* 

Hoewel de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië het beginsel van de vrije deelneming van zeeschepen van elke nationaliteit aan het internationale verkeer huldigt, wenst zij duidelijk te stellen dat bepaalde tijdelijke maatregelen ter bevordering van de zeescheepvaart een uitvloeisel zijn van de noodzaak, de Indonesische koopvaardij tot ontwikkeling te brengen. 
### *Ad artikel 5* 

1. Hoewel de Indonesische Regering het beginsel huldigt dat de behandeling van Nederlandse investeringen in geen geval voor de investeerders minder gunstig mag zijn dan de behandeling van haar eigen onderdanen, maakt zij een voorbehoud ten aanzien van de nationale behandeling van Nederlandse investeringen, zulks met het oog op de huidige stand van de ontwikkeling van de nationale economie van Indonesië. De Indonesische Regering tracht naar haar beste vermogen een nationale behandeling van Nederlandse investeerders te verzekeren. Als gevolg echter van recente ontwikkelingen hebben ondernemingen die buitenlands eigendom zijn en ondernemingen die Indonesisch eigendom zijn geen gelijke rechten, daar de Wet inzake investeringen van buitenlands kapitaal verschilt van de Wet inzake investeringen van binnenlands kapitaal. De behandeling van Nederlandse investeringen zal in geen geval minder gunstig zijn dan krachtens Wet nr. 1 van 1967 mogelijk is. Indien de Indonesische Regering ingevolge de huidige of de toekomstige wetgeving extra voordelen toekent of zal toekennen aan Indonesische investeerders zal zij, ten einde een eerlijke en billijke behandeling te verzekeren, dezelfde of compenserende faciliteiten toekennen aan Nederlandse investeerders die soortgelijke economische activiteiten uitoefenen
