(b) motorbrandstof, smeeroliën, reservedelen, normale uitrustingsstukken en boordproviand, niet behorende tot het onder *(a)* genoemde, worden behandeld op een basis, die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke van toepassing is op soortgelijke in het genoemde grondgebied ingevoerde voorraden en die bestemd zijn voor gebruik door of in de vliegtuigen van een nationale luchtvaartmaatschappij van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of van de meestbegunstigde buitenlandse luchtvaartmaatschappij, die internationale lucht diensten onderhoudt. Deze behandeling geldt naast die tot de toepassing waarvan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verplicht is ingevolge artikel 24 van het Verdrag en vermindert deze verplichting niet.    

### Artikel  5  

Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is gemachtigd op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zijn eigen technisch en administratief personeel te onderhouden ten einde de overeengekomen diensten te exploiteren, een en ander onverminderd de nationale voorschriften van de onderscheiden Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.  

### Artikel  6  

(1).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verleent aan een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht van vrije overmaking in U.S.-dollars of, indien beide partijen daarmede instemmen, in een ander wettig betaalmiddel tegen de officiële wisselkoers op het tijdstip van overmaking, van het saldo der ontvangsten na aftrek der uitgaven, dat als winst is geboekt op het grondgebied der eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij terzake van de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten door die aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij. De wijze van overmaken van dergelijke winsten dient evenwel in overeenstemming te zijn met de regelingen voor betalingen naar het buitenland zoals die van kracht zijn binnen het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, waar de winst is gemaakt.   
(2).  Ingeval het betalingsverkeer tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is geregeld krachtens een bijzondere overeenkomst, wordt die overeenkomst toegepast.   

### Artikel  7  

(1).  De wetten en voorschriften van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij met betrekking tot de toelating tot of het vertrek vanuit haar grondgebied van vliegtuigen, die internationale luchtdiensten onderhouden, of met betrekking tot de exploitatie en navigatie van zulke vliegtuigen tijdens hun verblijf binnen dit grondgebied zijn van toepassing op de vliegtuigen van een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij en deze vliegtuigen dienen daaraan te voldoen bij aankomst in of vertrek uit of tijdens hun verblijf binnen het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
(2).

(2).  Bij het exploiteren van de overeengekomen diensten door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt rekening gehouden met de belangen van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ten einde de diensten die laatstgenoemde maatschappij over de gehele route of een gedeelte daarvan onderhoudt, niet te zeer aan te tasten.   
(3).  De door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op de omschreven routes te onderhouden diensten hebben als eerste doel de verschaffing van capaciteit, die beantwoordt aan de vraag naar vervoer tussen het land, waar die luchtvaartmaatschappij gevestigd is en het land van uiteindelijke bestemming van het vervoer. Het recht van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen tot laden en lossen op punten, gelegen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, van internationaal vervoer bestemd voor of afkomstig uit derde landen via de omschreven routes, wordt toegepast in overeenstemming met de algemene beginselen van normale afwikkeling, waaraan de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zich zullen houden, onverminderd de algemene beginselen volgens welke de capaciteit dient te zijn afgestemd op: 

(a) de vervoersbehoeften tussen het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, die een luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen en de bestemmingen van het vervoer op de omschreven routes;  

(b) de behoeften van het doorgaande luchtvervoer;  

(c) de vervoersbehoeften van het gebied dat door de luchtvaartmaatschappij wordt aangedaan, nadat rekening is gehouden met plaatselijke en regionale diensten; en  

(d) de toereikendheid van andere, door de luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of door die van andere landen ingestelde, luchtdiensten tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden.     

### Artikel  9  

(1).  De tarieven geheven door de luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor vervoer naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dienen te worden vastgesteld op redelijk niveau, waarbij behoorlijk rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, de kenmerkende eigenschappen van de dienst (zoals maatstaven voor snelheid en accommodatie) en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor de omschreven routes of enig gedeelte daarvan.   
(2).  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven, evenals de tarieven van de agentenprovisie die daarop worden verleend, dienen, indien mogelijk, in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te worden vastgesteld en, waar zulks gewenst is, in onderling overleg met andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen, die de gehele route of een gedeelte daarvan exploiteren, en die overeenstemming dient, zo mogelijk, te worden bereikt door middel van de procedure van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging („International Air Transport Association”) ter vaststelling van de tarieven.   
(3).  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd ten minste negentig (90) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering; in bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, behoudens toestemming van de genoemde autoriteiten.   
(4).  Indien de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent een van deze tarieven, of indien om een andere reden een tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien gedurende de eerste dertig (30) dagen van de periode van negentig (90) dagen genoemd in het derde lid van dit artikel de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kennisgeving doet van haar ontevredenheid over een tarief vastgesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het tweede lid van dit artikel, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
(5).  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een hun volgens het derde lid van dit artikel voorgelegd tarief en omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief volgens het vierde lid, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 12 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(6).  Geen tarief wordt van kracht indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dit niet hebben goedgekeurd,   
(7).  De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  10  

Ten einde een nauwe samenwerking te verzekeren ten aanzien van alles wat op de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft en ten einde iedere mogelijke onderlinge samenwerking en bijstand tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Partijen voor een billijke en evenwichtige exploitatie van de overeengekomen luchtdiensten te bevorderen wordt door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overleg gepleegd op verzoek van die autoriteiten.  

### Artikel  11  

Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen, uitgereikt of geldig verklaard door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en welke niet zijn verlopen, worden door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij als geldig erkend wat betreft de exploitatie van de routes en diensten, voorzien in deze Overeenkomst, mits de vereisten die bij de uitgifte of de geldigverklaring van bedoelde bewijzen en vergunningen zijn gesteld ten minste gelijk zijn aan de minimummaatstaven, die mogen worden aangelegd krachtens het Verdrag inzake de Internationale Burgerluchtvaart. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor om, wat betreft het vliegen over haar eigen grondgebied, de aan haar eigen onderdanen door een andere staat verleende bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen niet als geldig te erkennen.  

### Artikel  12  

(1).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats het geschil te regelen door onderling overleg. Dit overleg moet een aanvang nemen binnen zestig (60) dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek van een der Partijen door de andere Partij.   
(2).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van overleg een regeling te treffen, wordt het geschil ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht van drie scheidsrechters, van wie er een door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen terwijl over de derde overeenstemming moet worden bereikt door de aldus gekozen twee scheidsrechters, onder het voorbehoud dat een zodanige derde scheidsrechter geen onderdaan is van een der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen benoemt binnen twee (2) maanden na de overhandiging door een der Partijen aan de andere Partij van een diplomatieke nota, waarin om voorlegging van het geschil wordt verzocht, haar scheidsrechter en ten aanzien van de derde scheidsrechter moet binnen een (1) maand na een zodanige periode van twee (2) maanden overeenstemming zijn bereikt. Indien een der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in gebreke blijft haar scheidsrechter binnen de vastgestelde tijd aan te wijzen of indien geen overeenstemming wordt bereikt ten aanzien van de derde scheidsrechter kan door elk der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aan de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie worden verzocht een scheidsrechter of eventueel scheidsrechters te benoemen. In dat geval dient de derde scheidsrechter een onderdaan te zijn van een derde staat en dient hij op te treden als President van het scheidsgerecht.   
(3).  Tenzij door de Overeenkomstsluitende partijen hierin op andere wijze is voorzien bepaalt het scheidsgerecht waar het zitting zal houden en stelt het zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
(4).  Het scheidsgerecht tracht het geschil met eenparigheid van stemmen op te lossen. Indien dit evenwel niet mogelijk is wordt het geschil opgelost bij meerderheid van stemmen.   
(5).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe, zich te houden aan iedere ingevolge het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel genomen beslissing.   

### Artikel  13  

(1).  Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het wenselijk acht de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te wijzigen, kan zij om overleg met de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verzoeken. Dit overleg vangt aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek. Aldus overeengekomen wijzigingen worden van kracht wanneer zij zijn bevestigd door een diplomatieke notawisseling.   
(2).  Wijzigingen van routes worden niet beschouwd als een wijziging van deze Overeenkomst en zij kunnen tot stand worden gebracht door rechtstreekse overeenstemming tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   

### Artikel  14  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan te allen tijde aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mededeling doen dat zij besloten is deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Indien een dergelijke mededeling wordt gedaan loopt de Overeenkomst af twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling in onderling overleg tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor het einde van deze termijn wordt ingetrokken. Indien van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen ontvangstbevestiging wordt ontvangen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.  

### Artikel  15  

Indien een algemeen multilateraal Verdrag inzake luchtvervoer voor beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in werking treedt, wordt deze Overeenkomst zodanig gewijzigd dat zij aansluit bij de bepalingen van een zodanig Verdrag.  

### Artikel  16  

Deze Overeenkomst en alle daarin in overeenstemming met artikel 13 aangebrachte wijzigingen zullen bij de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie worden geregistreerd.  

### Artikel  17  

(1).  Deze Overeenkomst dient door elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te worden goedgekeurd overeenkomstig haar wettelijke procedure en zal in werking treden op de dag van de uitwisseling van diplomatieke nota's die deze goedkeuring bevestigen.   
(2).  Wat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden betreft, is de Overeenkomst slechts van toepassing op het Rijk in Europa.
