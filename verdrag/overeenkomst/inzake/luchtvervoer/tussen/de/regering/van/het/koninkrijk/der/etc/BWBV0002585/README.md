Each of the Contracting Parties shall nominate an arbitrator within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other Contracting Party of a notice through diplomatic channels requesting arbitration of the dispute and the third arbitrator shall be appointed within a further period of sixty (60) days.

####Tarieven

1.  De tarieven die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in rekening worden gebracht voor het vervoer tussen hun grondgebieden dienen die tarieven te zijn welke zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en dienen te worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle ter zake dienende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig gedeelte van de omschreven route.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven dienen zo mogelijk te worden overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen met gebruikmaking van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging (IATA) voor de vaststelling van tarieven. Wanneer zulks niet mogelijk is, worden de tarieven overeengekomen tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen.

5.  Indien geen tarief kan worden overeengekomen in overeenstemming met het tweede lid van dit artikel of indien gedurende de krachtens het vierde lid van dit artikel van toepassing zijnde termijn de ene luchtvaartautoriteit de andere luchtvaartautoriteit kennisgeeft van haar afkeuring van een in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over een krachtens het derde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief of over de vaststelling van een tarief krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld overeenkomstig artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst.
