####Agreement between the Government of India and the Government of the Netherlands relating to air services

The Government of India and the Government of the Netherlands, hereinafter described as the Contracting Parties, Being Contracting Parties to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and the International Air Services Transit Agreement, both signed at Chicago on the seventh day of December, 1944, the terms of which Convention and Agreement are binding on both parties, And desiring to conclude an agreement for the operation of air transport services between and beyond their respective territories,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

Each Contracting Party grants to the other Contracting Party the right to operate the air services specified in the Annex to this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “specified air services”).  

### Article  II  

(A).  Each of the specified air services may be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the Contracting Party to whom the rights are granted, on condition that: 

1. The Contracting Party to whom the rights have been granted shall have designated an airline (hereinafter referred to as a “designated airline”) for the specified air route.  

2. The Contracting Party which grants the rights shall have given the appropriate operating permission to the airline, which it shall do with the least possible delay, provided that the airline has, if called upon, complied with the requirements of paragraph (B) of this Article.     
(B).  The designated airline may be required to satisfy the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Party granting the rights that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed by or under the laws and regulations normally applied by those authorities to the operation of international air services.   
(C).  The operation of each of the specified air services shall be subject to the agreement of the Contracting Party concerned that the route organisation available for civil aviation on the specified air route is adequate for the safe operation of air services.   

### Article  III  

The designated airlines of each Contracting Party operating the specified air services may, subject to the provisions of Article IV, set down or pick up in the territory of the other Contracting Party, at the points specified in the Annex, international traffic originating in or destined for the territory of the former Contracting Party or of a third country on the specified air route concerned.  

### Article  IV  

(A).  The aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall jointly determine in respect of an agreed period the total capacity required for the carriage, at a reasonable load factor, of all traffic, that is to say passengers, cargo and mails, which may reasonably be expected to originate in the territory of each Contracting Party and to be disembarked in the territory of the other Contracting Party on the specified air services to be operated during that period on each of the specified air routes. The aeronautical authorities shall then determine the capacities and frequencies to be provided by the designated airline of each of the Contracting Parties.   
(B).  In this Article, “agreed period” means the first twelve months from the date this Agreement comes into force and, thereafter, every succeeding period of twelve months unless otherwise agreed between the aeronautical authorities.   
(C).  Pending the completion of any review of capacity in accordance with the provisions of this Article the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall be entitled to continue to make available on their air services the capacities and frequencies last agreed between the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties.   

### Article  V  

(A).  The aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties shall exchange information as promptly as possible concerning the current authorizations extended to their respective designated airlines to render service to, through and from the territory of the other Contracting Party. This will include copies of current certificates and authorizations for service on the specified air routes, together with amendments, exemption orders and authorised service patterns,   
(B).  Each Contracting Party shall cause its designated airlines to provide to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party, as long in advance as practicable, copies of time tables, tariff schedules, including any modifications thereof, and all other relevant information concerning the operation of the specified air services including such information as may be required to satisfy the aeronautical authorities that the requirements of this Agreement are being duly observed.   
(C).  Each Contracting Party shall cause its designated airlines to provide to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party statistics relating to the traffic carried on their air services to, from or over the territory of the other Contracting Party showing the origin and destination of the traffic.   

### Article  VI  

(A).  Rates shall be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including costs of comparable economical operation, reasonable profit and differences of characteristics of service.   
(B).  The rates to be charged by the designated airlines of each Contracting Party in respect of traffic carried under this Agreement to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be agreed in the first instance between the designated airlines of both the Parties and shall have regard to relevant rates adopted by the International Air Transport Association. Any rates so agreed shall be subject to the approval of the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties. In the event of disagreement between the airlines and/or the aeronautical authorities, the Contracting Parties themselves shall endeavour to reach agreement and will take all necessary steps to give effect to such agreement. Should the Contracting Parties fail to agree, the dispute shall be dealt with in accordance with Article XI. Pending the settlement of any disagreement, the rates already established shall prevail.   

### Article  VII  

Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into or taken on board aircraft in the territory of one Contracting Party by, or on behalf of, the other Contracting Party or its designated airlines and intended solely for use by the latter's aircraft shall be accorded, with respect to customs duty, inspection fees or other charges imposed by the former Contracting Party, treatment not less favourable than that granted to its national airlines engaged in international public transport or to the airlines of the most favoured nation.  

### Article  VIII  

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to itself to withhold or revoke, or impose such appropriate conditions as it may deem necessary with respect to an operating permission, in case it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of the airline are vested in nationals of the other Contracting Party, or in case of failure by a designated airline of the other Party to comply with the laws and regulations of the former Party, or in case, in the judgment of the former Party, there is a failure to fulfil the conditions under which the rights are granted in accordance with this Agreement. Except in case of a failure to comply with laws and regulations, such action shall be taken only after consultation between the Parties. In the event of action by one Party under this Article, the rights of the other Party under Article XI shall not be prejudiced.  

### Article  VIII – Bis  

####Aviation Security

(A).  Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties reaffirm that their obligation to each other to protect the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference forms an integral part of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall, in particular, act in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970 and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971.   
(B).  The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts on unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.   
(C).  The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and designated as Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Parties, they shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry or operators of aircraft who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory and the operators of airports in their territory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.   
(D).  Each Contracting Party agrees that such operators of aircraft may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph (3) above generally required by the other Contracting Party for entry into, departure from, or while within, territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that adequate measures are effectively applied within its territory to protect the aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew, carry-on items, baggage, cargo and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding and loading. Each Contracting Party shall also give sympathetic consideration to any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
(E).  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.   
(F).  Each Contracting Party shall take measures, as it may find practicable, to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which has landed in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.   

### Article  IX  

(A).  In a spirit of close collaboration, the aeronautical authorities of the two Contracting Parties will consult regularly with a view to assuring the observance of the principles and the implementation of the provisions outlined in this Agreement.   
(B).  Either Contracting Party may at any time request consultation with the other with a view to initiating any amendments of the Agreement which it may deem desirable. Such consultation shall begin within a period of sixty days from the date of the request. Any modification of this Agreement agreed to as a result of such consultation shall come into effect when it has been confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes.   
(C).  Changes made by either Contracting Party in the specified air routes, except those which change the points served by the designated airlines in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall not be considered as modifications of this Agreement. The aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party may, therefore, proceed unilaterally to make such changes, provided, however, that notice of any change shall be given without delay to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party. If such latter aeronautical authorities find that, having regard to the principles set forth in this Agreement, the interests of any of their airlines are prejudiced by the carriage by a designated airline of the first Contracting Party of traffic between the territory of the second Contracting Party, and the new point in the territory of a third country, the latter Party may request consultation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (B) of this Article.   

### Article  X  

Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall be simultaneously communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. This Agreement shall terminate one year after the date of receipt of the notice by the other Contracting Party, unless the notice is withdrawn by agreement before the expiration of this period. In the absence of acknowledgment of receipt by the other Contracting Party notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  

### Article  XI  

(A).  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation between themselves.   
(B).  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, 

(i) they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to an arbitral tribunal or some other person or body appointed by agreement between them; or  

(ii) if they do not so agree or if, having agreed to refer the dispute to an arbitral tribunal they cannot reach agreement as to its composition, either Contracting Party may submit the dispute for decision to any tribunal competent to decide it established within the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or, if there be no such tribunal, to the International Court of Justice.     
(C).  The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision given, including any interim recommendation made, under paragraph (B) of this Article.   
(D).  If and so long as either Contracting Party or a designated airline of either Contracting Party fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (C) of this Article, the other Contracting Party may limit, withhold or revoke any rights which it has granted by virtue of the present Agreement.   

### Article  XII  

This Agreement shall come into force on the 17th of June, 1951.  

### Article  XIII  

In the event of the conclusion of a multilateral convention or agreement concerning air transport to which both Contracting Parties adhere, this Agreement shall be modified to conform with the provisions of such convention or agreement.  

### Article  XIV  

(A).  For the purpose of this Agreement the terms “territory”, “air service”, “international air service” and “air line” shall have the meaning specified in the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944.   
(B).  The term “aeronautical authorities” shall mean, in the case of India, the Director General of Civil Aviation, India, and in the case of the Netherlands, the Director General of Civil Aviation in the Netherlands, and in both cases any person or body authorised to perform the functions presently exercised by the above mentioned authorities.   

### Article  XV  

The Annex to this Agreement shall be deemed to be part of the Agreement and all references to the “Agreement” shall include references to the Annex, except where otherwise expressly provided.  

In witness whereof the undersigned plenipotentiaries, being duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed the present Agreement. Done this 24th day of May 1951 in duplicate at New Delhi in the English language.  *For the Government of India*  (s.) RASI AHMED KIDWAI  *For the Government of the Netherlands*  (s.) A. M. L.

####Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van India en de Nederlandse Regering betreffende luchtdiensten

De Regering van India en de Nederlandse Regering, hierna te noemen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, Partij zijnde bij het Verdrag inzake de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart en de Overeenkomst inzake de doortocht van Internationale Luchtdiensten, beide ondertekend te Chicago op de zevende dag van December 1944, waarvan de bepalingen bindend zijn voor beide partijen, En wensende een overeenkomst te sluiten voor de exploitatie van luchtvervoersdiensten tussen en via haar onderscheidene grondgebieden,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  I  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verleent aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht de luchtdiensten te exploiteren, omschreven in de Bijlage van deze Overeenkomst (hierna te noemen de „omschreven luchtdiensten”).  

### Artikel  II  

A).  Elk van de omschreven luchtdiensten kan onmiddellijk dan wel op een later tijdstip naar verkiezing van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, waaraan de rechten worden verleend, worden geopend, op voorwaarde, dat: 

1) De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, waaraan de rechten zijn verleend, een luchtvaartmaatschappij (hierna te noemen een „aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij”) zal hebben aangewezen voor de omschreven luchtroute.  

2) De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke de rechten verleent, aan de luchtvaartmaatschappij de passende exploitatievergunning zal hebben verleend, hetgeen zij met de minst mogelijke vertraging zal doen, mits de luchtvaartmaatschappij, indien zulks van haar verlangd wordt, voldaan heeft aan de eisen van lid B) van dit Artikel.     
B).  Van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan worden verlangd, dat zij ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke de rechten verleent, aantoont, dat zij in staat is de voorwaarden na te komen, voorgeschreven bij of krachtens de wetten en voorschriften, welke gewoonlijk door die autoriteiten ten aanzien van de exploitatie van internationale luchtdiensten worden toegepast.   
C).  De exploitatie van elk van de omschreven luchtdiensten zal onderworpen zijn aan de bevestiging van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, dat de route-organisatie, beschikbaar voor de burgerlijke luchtvaart op de omschreven luchtroute, voldoende is voor de veilige exploitatie van luchtdiensten.   

### Artikel  III  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, die de omschreven luchtdiensten exploiteren, mogen, behoudens het bepaalde in Artikel IV, op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, op de punten, omschreven in de Bijlage, internationaal verkeer afzetten of opnemen, afkomstig uit of bestemd voor het grondgebied van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of van een derde land op de betreffende omschreven luchtroute.  

### Artikel  IV  

A).  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen gezamenlijk ten aanzien van een overeengekomen periode de totale capaciteit vaststellen, die bij een redelijke bezettingsgraad benodigd is voor het vervoer van alle redelijkerwijs te verwachten verkeer, d.w.z. passagiers, vracht en post, dat op de omschreven luchtdiensten, die gedurende die periode op ieder van de opgesomde luchtroutes zullen worden geëxploiteerd, afkomstig is uit het grondgebied van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en dat zal worden afgezet op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. De luchtvaartautoriteiten zullen dan de door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te verschaffen capaciteiten en frequenties vaststellen.   
B).  In dit Artikel betekent „overeengekomen periode” de eerste twaalf maanden te rekenen van de datum af, waarop deze Overeenkomst van kracht wordt en daarna, iedere volgende periode van twaalf maanden, tenzij tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten anders wordt overeengekomen.   
C).  Hangende de voltooiing van een beoordeling van de capaciteit overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Artikel zullen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gerechtigd zijn om op hun luchtdiensten de capaciteiten en frequenties te blijven verschaffen, waaromtrent tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het laatst overeenstemming is bereikt.   

### Artikel  V  

A).  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen zo spoedig mogelijk gegevens uitwisselen, betreffende de lopende vergunningen verleend aan haar onderscheiden aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen om diensten te verschaffen naar, via en van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Daaronder zullen worden gerekend afschriften van lopende certificaten en vergunningen voor het dienst doen op de omschreven luchtroutes benevens wijzigingen, vrijstellingen en toegestane dienstschema's.   
B).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal bewerkstelligen, dat haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zo lang mogelijk van te voren zullen verschaffen afschriften van dienstregelingen, tarievenlijsten, met inbegrip van alle wijzigingen daarvan en alle andere terzake dienende inlichtingen, betreffende de exploitatie van de omschreven luchtdiensten, waaronder zodanige inlichtingen als verlangd kunnen worden om ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten aan te tonen, dat de vereisten van deze Overeenkomst behoorlijk in acht worden genomen.   
C).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal bewerkstelligen, dat haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij statistieken verschaffen betreffende het verkeer, dat op haar luchtdiensten naar, van en over het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij werd vervoerd, waaruit de herkomst en bestemming van het verkeer blijken.   

### Artikel  VI  

A).  Tarieven zullen worden vastgesteld op redelijke hoogten, waarbij behoorlijk rekening wordt gehouden met alle terzake dienende factoren, daarbij inbegrepen de kosten van vergelijkbare economische exploitatie, redelijke winst en verschillen in hoedanigheid van de dienst.   
B).  De door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te heffen tarieven ten aanzien van verkeer, dat op grond van deze Overeenkomst naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vervoerd wordt, zullen in eerste aanleg overeengekomen worden tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Partijen en zullen verband houden met terzake dienende tarieven, welke zijn aangenomen door de International Air Transport Association. Alle zodanig overeengekomen tarieven zullen onderworpen zijn aan de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. In geval van meningsverschil tussen de luchtvaartmaatschappijen en/of de luchtvaartautoriteiten, zullen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zelf trachten tot overeenstemming te geraken en zullen zij alle nodige stappen ondernemen om zulk een overeenkomst ten uitvoer te brengen. Zouden de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen tot overeenstemming te komen, dan zal het geschilpunt worden behandeld overeenkomstig artikel XI. Hangende de regeling van enig meningsverschil zullen de tarieven, welke reeds zijn vastgesteld, gelden.   

### Artikel  VII  

Ten aanzien van motorbrandstof, smeeroliën en reservedelen, ingevoerd of aan boord genomen van luchtvaartuigen op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij door of namens de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen en uitsluitend bestemd om te worden gebruikt door de luchtvaartuigen van laatstgenoemde, wordt, voor wat betreft douanerechten, inspectiekosten of andere rechten, geheven door de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, een behandeling toegepast, welke niet ongunstiger is dan die, toegestaan aan haar nationale luchtvaartmaatschappijen, welke zich bezig houden met internationaal openbaar vervoer of aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de meest begunstigde natie.  

### Artikel  VIII  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor een exploitatievergunning niet te verlenen of in te trekken of zodanige passende voorwaarden te stellen als zij met betrekking daarop noodzakelijk kan achten ingeval niet tot haar genoegen is gebleken, dat het overwegende eigendomsrecht en de daadwerkelijke leiding van de luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij onderdanen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of in geval een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Partij in gebreke blijft zich te houden aan de wetten en reglementen van de eerste Partij of in geval naar het oordeel van de eerste Partij de voorwaarden, waaronder de rechten overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst worden verleend, niet worden nagekomen. Behoudens in het geval van niet naleven van wetten en reglementen zullen zodanige maatregelen enkel na overleg tussen de Partijen worden genomen. In geval van maatregelen door een Partij op grond van dit Artikel, zullen de rechten van de andere Partij op grond van Artikel XI onverlet blijven.  

### Artikel  VIII-bis  

####Veiligheid van de luchtvaart

a.  In overeenstemming met hun rechten en verplichtingen krachtens het internationale recht bevestigen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen opnieuw dat hun verplichting jegens elkaar tot bescherming van de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart tegen daden van wederrechtelijke inmenging ien wezenlijk deel van deze Overeenkomst uitmaakt. Zonder hun rechten en verplichtingen krachtens het internationale recht in het algemeen te beperken, handelen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, in het bijzonder, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag inzake strafbare feiten en bepaalde andere handelingen begaan aan boord van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te Tokyo op 14 september 1963, het Verdrag tot bestrijding van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te 's-Gravenhage op 16 december 1970, en het Verdrag tot bestrijding van wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, ondertekend te Montreal op 23 september 1971.   
b.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlenen elkaar op verzoek alle nodige bijstand ten einde gedragingen van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van burgerluchtvaartuigen en andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van deze luchtvaartuigen, de passagiers en de bemanning daarvan, luchthavens en voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart, alsmede elke andere bedreiging voor de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, te voorkomen.   
c.  De Partijen handelen in hun onderlinge betrekkingen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart, vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie en aangeduid als Bijlagen bij het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart, voor zover deze veiligheidsbepalingen van toepassing zijn op de Partijen; zij dienen te verlangen dat de exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen die in hun land zijn geregistreerd of die hun voornaamste plaats van bedrijfsuitoefening of hun vaste woon- of verblijfplaats op hun grondgebieden hebben, en de exploitanten van luchthavens op hun grondgebied handelen in overeenstemming met deze bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart.   
d.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stemt ermede in dat deze exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen de bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart, als bedoeld in het derde lid hierboven en in het algemeen verlangd door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bij de binnenkomst op, het verlaten van of gedurende het verblijf op het grondgebied van deze andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, in acht dienen te nemen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zorgt ervoor dat op haar grondgebied op doeltreffende wijze passende maatregelen worden uitgevoerd om de luchtvaartuigen te beschermen en de passagiers, bemanning, handbagage, bagage, vracht en vliegtuigvoorraden aan een onderzoek te onderwerpen voor en tijdens het aan boord gaan en het laden. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt tevens elk verzoek van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om binnen redelijke grenzen bijzondere veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen ten einde aan een bepaalde dreiging het hoofd te bieden, in welwillende overweging.   
e.  Wanneer zich een voorval voordoet van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van burgerluchtvaartuigen of van andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van die luchtvaartuigen, de passagiers en bemanning daarvan, luchthavens of voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart, of dreigt zich voor te doen, verlenen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander bijstand door vergemakkelijking van de verbindingen en door andere passende maatregelen, bedoeld om op snelle en veilige wijze een einde te maken aan een dergelijk voorval of de dreiging daarvan.   
f.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt de door haar uitvoerbaar geachte maatregelen om te verzekeren dat een luchtvaartuig dat op haar grondgebied is geland, en dat het voorwerp is van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen of van andere gedragingen van wederrechtelijke inmenging, op de grond wordt vastgehouden, tenzij het vertrek daarvan noodzakelijk is wegens de alles overheersende plicht mensenlevens te beschermen. Wanneer mogelijk, worden deze maatregelen genomen op basis van onderling overleg.   

### Artikel  IX  

A).  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking zullen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen geregeld overleg plegen, teneinde het inachtnemen van de beginselen en de uitwerking van de bepalingen, uiteengezet in deze Overeenkomst, te verzekeren.   
B).  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan op elk willekeurig tijdstip overleg met de andere verzoeken, teneinde te komen tot wijzigingen van de Overeenkomst, welke zij wenselijk kan achten. Zulk overleg zal aanvangen binnen een periode van 60 dagen te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek. Enige wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, welke als resultaat van zulk overleg wordt overeengekomen, zal van kracht worden wanneer zij is bevestigd door uitwisseling van diplomatieke nota's.   
C).  Wijzigingen, aangebracht door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de omschreven luchtroutes, behoudens die, welke verandering brengen in de punten, bediend door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen in het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zullen niet worden beschouwd als wijzigingen van deze Overeenkomst. De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen derhalve eenzijdig tot zulke wijzigingen overgaan, mits echter onverwijld mededeling van enige verandering aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal worden gedaan. Indien laatstgenoemde luchtvaartautoriteiten van mening zijn, dat met het oog op de beginselen, vervat in deze Overeenkomst, de belangen van enige van haar luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden benadeeld door het vervoer door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van verkeer tussen het grondgebied van de tweede Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en het nieuwe punt in het grondgebied van een derde land, kan laatstgenoemde Partij overleg verzoeken overeenkomstig de voorwaarden van lid B) van dit Artikel.   

### Artikel  X  

Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan ten allen tijde aan de andere mededeling doen van haar wens deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Een zodanige mededeling zal tegelijkertijd worden gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie. Deze Overeenkomst zal eindigen één jaar na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling in onderling overleg wordt ingetrokken voor het verstrijken van die termijn. Bij ontbreken van ontvangstbevestiging van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal de mededeling geacht worden te zijn ontvangen veertien dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie.  

### Artikel  XI  

A).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen enig geschil rijst met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, zullen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats trachten dit geschil door onderling overleg op te lossen.   
B).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door overleg tot oplossing te geraken,
