### Artikel  7  

####Beginselen inzake de exploitatie van overeengekomen diensten

1.  De door beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden op billijke en gelijke wijze in de gelegenheid gesteld de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes te exploiteren.   
2.  Bij de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten houdt de door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij rekening met de belangen van de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zodat de diensten die de laatstgenoemde luchtvaartmaatschappij op dezelfde routes of een deel daarvan onderhoudt, niet op onredelijke wijze worden getroffen.   
3.  De overeengekomen luchtdiensten die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden onderhouden, dienen nauwkeurig te worden afgestemd op de vervoersbehoeften van het publiek op de omschreven routes en hebben als voornaamste doel het verschaffen, bij een redelijke bezettingsgraad, van capaciteit die beantwoordt aan de huidige en redelijkerwijze te verwachten behoefte aan vervoer van passagiers en vracht, met inbegrip van post, naar en van het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen. In het vervoer van passagiers en vracht, met inbegrip van post, zowel aan boord genomen als afgezet op punten van de omschreven routes op het grondgebied van andere Staten dan de Staat die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen, wordt voorzien overeenkomstig de algemene beginselen volgens welke de capaciteit dient te zijn afgestemd op: 

a. de behoeften aan vervoer naar en van het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen;  

b. de vervoersbehoeften van het gebied dat in het kader van de overeengekomen luchtdiensten wordt aangedaan, nadat rekening is gehouden met andere vervoerdiensten, ingesteld door luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Staten die te zamen dit gebied vormen; en  

c. de eisen die de exploitatie van doorgaande luchtdiensten stelt.     

### Artikel  8  

####Goedkeuring dienstregelingen

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij legt uiterlijk dertig (30) dagen vóór de aanvang van de luchtdiensten op de omschreven routes de dienstregelingen met inbegrip van de te gebruiken typen luchtvaartuigen ter goedkeuring voor aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Dit is eveneens van toepasssing op latere wijzigingen. In bijzondere gevallen kan deze termijn worden verkort met toestemming van de bovengenoemde autoriteiten.  

### Artikel  9  

####Tarieven

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt onder „tarief” verstaan een door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen, rechtstreeks of via hun vertegenwoordigers, van een persoon of rechtspersoon geheven of te heffen bedrag voor het vervoer van passagiers (met hun bagage) en vracht (met uitzondering van post), met inbegrip van: 

a. de voorwaarden betreffende de geldigheid en de toepassing van een tarief; en  

b. de kosten van en de voorwaarden voor de door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen verleende extra diensten met betrekking tot dit vervoer.     
2.  De tarieven die door de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden geheven voor het vervoer naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, worden op een redelijk niveau vastgesteld, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
3.  De in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, in onderlinge overeenstemming vastgesteld door de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in overleg met de andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de route of een deel daarvan exploiteren. Deze overeenstemming dient, indien mogelijk, te worden bereikt met gebruikmaking van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging of een soortgelijke internationaal erkende bedrijfsorganisatie.   
4.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd ten minste vijfenveertig (45) dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van invoering. In bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, indien de genoemde autoriteiten zulks overeenkomen.   
5.  Deze goedkeuring kan uitdrukkelijk worden verleend. Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet binnen dertig (30) dagen, te rekenen van de datum waarop deze tarieven in overeenstemming met het vierde lid van dit artikel zijn voorgelegd, te kennen hebben gegeven deze niet goed te keuren, worden zij geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Ingeval het tijdvak van voorlegging is verkort, zoals voorzien in het vierde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten onderling overeenkomen dat het tijdvak waarbinnen de kennisgeving moet worden gedaan dat niet tot goedkeuring wordt overgegaan, korter is dan dertig (30) dagen.   
6.  Indien gedurende het overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van dit artikel van toepassing zijnde tijdvak de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij hun goedkeuring onthouden aan een door of namens de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het vierde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, op verzoek van een van hen, het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen en doen al het mogelijke om deze overeenstemming ten uitvoer te brengen.   
7.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten, na eventueel overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een andere Staat of andere Staten, geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de vaststelling van een tarief ingevolge het zesde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 13 van deze Overeenkomst.   
8.  Een overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgesteld tarief blijft van kracht totdat een nieuw tarief is vastgesteld. Niettemin wordt een tarief niet op grond van dit lid verlengd voor langer dan twaalf (12) maanden na de datum waarop het anders zou zijn vervallen.   

### Artikel  10  

####Uitwisseling van gegevens

1.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wisselen zo spoedig als mogelijk is gegevens uit betreffende de lopende vergunningen, verleend aan hun onderscheiden aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen, voor het onderhouden van luchtdiensten naar, via en vanuit het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Hiertoe behoren afschriften van geldige certificaten en vergunningen voor luchtdiensten op omschreven routes, alsmede wijzigingen, ontheffingsbeschikkingen en goedgekeurde dienstenschema's.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zorgt ervoor dat de door haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, zo tijdig van te voren als uitvoerbaar is, aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij afschriften verschaft van de tarieven, dienstregelingen, met inbegrip van eventuele wijzigingen daarvan, alsmede alle andere ter zake dienende gegevens betreffende de exploitatie van de overeengekomen luchtdiensten, met inbegrip van gegevens omtrent de op elke van de omschreven routes aangeboden capaciteit, en alle andere gegevens die nodig kunnen zijn om ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te kunnen aantonen dat de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst naar behoren in acht worden genomen.   
3.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zorgt ervoor dat de door haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij statistische gegevens verschaft betreffende het op de overeengekomen luchtdiensten verrichte vervoer, daarbij inbegrepen de punten waar passagiers, vracht en post zijn opgenomen en afgezet.   

### Artikel  11  

####Overmaking van inkomsten

Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verleent aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht van vrije overmaking van het batig saldo van de ontvangsten en uitgaven, verkregen door de luchtvaartmaatschappij op het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, op basis van de gangbare koersen op de markt voor buitenlandse valuta voor lopende betalingen.  

### Artikel  12  

####Overleg

1.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen plegen, in een geest van nauwe samenwerking, van tijd tot tijd overleg met elkaar, ten einde de uitvoering en de bevredigende naleving van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en van de aangehechte Routetabellen te verzekeren, en plegen zo nodig overleg ten einde wijzigingen daarvan mogelijk te maken.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan schriftelijk verzoeken om overleg, dat een aanvang dient te nemen binnen een tijdvak van zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek, tenzij beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen instemmen met een verlenging van dit tijdvak.   

### Artikel  13  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen, kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan een persoon of instantie; indien zij zulks niet overeenkomen, wordt het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht, bestaande uit drie (3) scheidsmannen, van wie er één door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen en de derde wordt benoemd door de twee andere aangewezenen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wijst een scheidsman aan binnen zestig (60) dagen na het tijdstip waarop een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen langs diplomatieke weg van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen waarin om voorlegging van het geschil aan een scheidsgerecht wordt verzocht, en de derde scheidsman wordt binnen het daaraan aansluitende tijdvak van eveneens zestig (60) dagen benoemd. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat binnen het aangegeven tijdvak een scheidsman aan te wijzen, of indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen het aangegeven tijdvak wordt benoemd, kan de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een scheidsman of eventueel scheidsmannen benoemen. In dat geval dient de derde scheidsman onderdaan te zijn van een derde Staat en op te treden als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen onderwerpen zich aan iedere ingevolge het tweede lid van dit artikel genomen beslissing.   
4.  De kosten van het scheidsgerecht worden gelijkelijk door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gedragen.

Zulk overleg kan plaatsvinden door middel van wederzijdse correspondentie.   
2.  Indien de wijziging betrekking heeft op andere bepalingen van de Overeenkomst dan de Routetabellen, dan dient de wijziging door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te worden goedgekeurd overeenkomstig haar constitutionele procedures en wordt deze van kracht wanneer zij wordt bevestigd door middel van de uitwisseling van diplomatieke nota's.   
3.  Indien de wijziging slechts betrekking heeft op de Routetabellen, dan wordt deze overeengekomen tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.
