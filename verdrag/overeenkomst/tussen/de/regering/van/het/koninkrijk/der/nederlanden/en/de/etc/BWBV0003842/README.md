### Artikel  6  

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden billijk en gelijkelijk in de gelegenheid gesteld de overeengekomen diensten tussen de grondgebieden van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te exploiteren. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen eerbiedigen het beginsel van gelijke verdeling van de voor de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten aangeboden vervoerscapaciteit.   
2.  De door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij houdt rekening met de belangen van de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, zulks ten einde de overeengekomen diensten van laatstgenoemde luchtvaartmaatschappij niet onnodig aan te tasten.   
3.  Op elk van de in de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst omschreven routes is het voornaamste doel van de overeengekomen diensten het op basis van een redelijk geachte beladingsgraad verschaffen van een capaciteit die beantwoordt aan de normaal en redelijkerwijs te verwachten behoeften van het internationaal verkeer van of naar het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen welke de genoemde diensten exploiteert.   
4.  De door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan, binnen de grenzen van de in het derde lid van dit artikel voorziene globale capaciteit, voldoen aan de verkeersbehoeften tussen de grondgebieden van de derde Staat genoemd in de aan deze Overeenkomst gehechte Routetabellen en het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
5.  Ten einde te voldoen aan de behoeften van onvoorzien of tijdelijk verkeer op deze routes, komen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen onderling tot overeenstemming aangaande de frequentie der diensten, de dienstregelingen en, in het algemeen, aangaande de voorwaarden waarop deze diensten worden geëxploiteerd, daarbij rekening houdend met hun onderscheiden capaciteiten tot het verschaffen van luchtvervoersdiensten. De tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen gesloten overeenkomsten en de daarin aan te brengen wijzigingen worden ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
6.  Ingeval de door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op een of meer routes geen gebruik wenst te maken van een deel of het geheel van de aan haar verleende vervoerscapaciteit, kan zij met de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij overeenkomen aan laatstgenoemde voor een vastgestelde periode een deel of het geheel van de desbetreffende vervoerscapaciteit over te dragen. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij die een deel van of al haar rechten overdraagt, kan deze aan het einde van de vastgestelde periode terugnemen.   
7.  Voor de aanvang van de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten komen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen tot overeenstemming over de praktische toepassing van de in de voorgaande leden van dit artikel bedoelde beginselen met betrekking tot de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   

### Artikel  7

b) reserveonderdelen en normale uitrustingsstukken, ingevoerd op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor het onderhoud of herstel van op de internationale diensten van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in gebruik zijnde vliegtuigen;  

c) motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen, aan boord genomen op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bestemd voor de bevoorrading van door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op internationale diensten geëxploiteerde vliegtuigen, zelfs indien deze voorraden moeten worden gebruikt tijdens het gedeelte van de vlucht boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waarop zij aan boord waren genomen.     
3.  De normale vliegtuiguitrusting en de goederen en proviand die zich aan boord bevinden van een door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geëxploiteerd vliegtuig mogen slechts op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van dat grondgebied. In zo'n geval worden zodanige goederen en proviand geplaatst onder het toezicht van bedoelde autoriteiten totdat zij zijn gebruikt of op andere wijze aangewend.   

### Artikel  8  

Passagiers, bagage en vracht, in rechtstreekse doorvoer via het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, die het te hunnen behoeve gereserveerde deel van het vliegveld niet verlaten, zijn slechts onderworpen aan een sterk vereenvoudigde controle. Bagage en vracht in rechtstreekse doorvoer zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en andere soortgelijke heffingen.  

### Artikel  9  

1.  De wetten en voorschriften van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die binnen haar grondgebied van toepassing zijn op de binnenkomst of het vertrek van vliegtuigen, welke voor internationaal luchtverkeer worden gebruikt, of op vluchten van deze vliegtuigen boven bedoeld grondgebied, zijn van toepassing op de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij.

3.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verbindt zich ertoe terzake van de toepassing van de in dit artikel bedoelde wetten en voorschriften geen voorkeur te geven aan haar eigen luchtvaartmaatschappijen ten opzichte van de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij.   
4.  Voor het gebruik van de luchthavens en andere faciliteiten, aangeboden door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, betaalt de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij geen hogere heffingen dan die welke moeten worden betaald voor de aan de geregelde internationale diensten deelnemende nationale vliegtuigen.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen uitgereikt of geldig verklaard door een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, worden gedurende de duur van hun geldigheid als geldig erkend door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
2.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen, uitgereikt aan haar eigen onderdanen of te hunnen gunste geldig verklaard door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of door een andere Staat, voor vluchten over haar eigen grondgebied, niet als geldig te erkennen.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  De tarieven op de overeengekomen diensten worden vastgesteld op redelijk niveau, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, met inbegrip van de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, de kenmerkende eigenschappen van iedere dienst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, zo mogelijk, in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de twee Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vastgesteld na overleg met de andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de gehele route of een gedeelte daarvan exploiteren. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen dienen, zo mogelijk, die overeenstemming te bereiken met behulp van de procedure ter vaststelling van tarieven, vastgesteld door de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging (IATA).   
3.  De aldus vastgestelde tarieven worden ten minste dertig (30) dagen voor de datum waarop ze van kracht moeten worden, ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. In bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, afhankelijk van de instemming van de genoemde autoriteiten.   
4.  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen of indien de tarieven niet worden goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de tarieven in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
5.  Indien geen overeenstemming wordt bereikt, wordt het geschil onderworpen aan arbitrage, als voorzien in het hierna volgende artikel 15.   
6.  De reeds vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht in afwachting van de vaststelling van nieuwe tarieven in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in dit artikel of in het hierna volgende artikel 15.   

### Artikel  12  

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verschaffen elkaar op verzoek periodieke statistieken of andere soortgelijke inlichtingen, waarin voor elk punt van in- en ontscheping en, waar mogelijk, voor elk punt van aanvang en bestemming het vervoersvolume op de overeengekomen diensten wordt aangegeven.  

### Artikel  13  

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen plegen in een geest van nauwe samenwerking van tijd tot tijd met elkander overleg, teneinde te verzekeren, dat de in deze Overeenkomst neergelegde beginselen worden toegepast en dat haar doelstellingen op bevredigende wijze worden verzekerd.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Indien een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het wenselijk acht een bepaling van deze Overeenkomst te wijzigen, kan zij de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om overleg verzoeken. Dit overleg vangt aan binnen zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen stemmen schriftelijk in met elke wijziging van deze Overeenkomst en die wijziging wordt van kracht zodra de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander hebben medegedeeld dat de voor de inwerkingtreding van internationale overeenkomsten vereiste grondwettelijke procedures zijn voltooid.   
2.  Wijzigingen van de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst kunnen rechtstreeks worden overeengekomen door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. Deze wijzigingen worden van kracht nadat zij zijn bevestigd door een diplomatieke notawisseling.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Geschillen tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, die niet door rechtstreekse onderhandeling of langs diplomatieke weg kunnen worden opgelost, worden op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht, bestaande uit drie leden.   
2.  Te dien einde benoemt elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een scheidsman en de beide scheidsmannen benoemen in onderlinge overeenstemming een derde scheidsman, die een onderdaan moet zijn van een derde Staat, als voorzitter. Indien binnen een tijdsverloop van zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de dag waarop een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een scheidsman heeft benoemd, de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij haar scheidsman niet heeft benoemd, of indien gedurende de zestig dagen volgende op de benoeming van de tweede scheidsman, de aldus benoemde scheidsmannen geen overeenstemming hebben bereikt over de keuze van de voorzitter, kan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie verzoeken de nodige benoemingen te verrichten.   
3.  Het scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedureregels vast en bepaalt de plaats waar het zitting zal houden.   
4.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe zich te houden aan elke overeenkomstig dit artikel genomen beslissing.   
5.  Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zich niet houdt aan de beslissing van de scheidsmannen kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zolang eerstgenoemde Partij daarin volhardt, de rechten en voorrechten welke zij krachtens deze Overeenkomst aan de in gebreke zijnde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij had verleend, beperken, opschorten of intrekken.   
6.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt de vergoeding van haar scheidsman alsmede de helft van de vergoeding van de aangewezen voorzitter voor haar rekening.   

### Artikel  16  

Deze Overeenkomst en de Bijlage, benevens de wijzigingen die daarin mochten worden aangebracht, worden geregistreerd bij de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.  

### Artikel  17  

Deze Overeenkomst en de Bijlage worden gewijzigd ten einde hen, wanneer zulks noodzakelijk is, in overeenstemming te brengen met multilaterale verdragen die de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zouden kunnen binden.  

### Artikel  18  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan te allen tijde aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mededeling doen van haar wens deze Overeenkomst op te zeggen. Een zodanige kennisgeving wordt gelijktijdig gericht aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. De opzegging wordt van kracht twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de opzegging voor het einde van deze periode in onderling overleg wordt ingetrokken. Indien van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen ontvangstbevestiging wordt ontvangen, wordt de kennisgeving geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na de datum waarop de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie de kennisgeving ontvangt.  

### Artikel  19
