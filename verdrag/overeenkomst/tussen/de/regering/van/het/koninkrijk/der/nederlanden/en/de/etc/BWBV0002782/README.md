(a) De Regering van Hong Kong heeft het recht de verlening van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunningen te weigeren of door haar noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden te verbinden aan de uitoefening door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de in artikel 3(2) van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten, in alle gevallen waarin niet tot haar genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het feitelijke toezicht op deze luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden of haar onderdanen of bij beide.  

(b) De Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden heeft het recht de verlening van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunningen te weigeren, of door haar noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden te verbinden aan de uitoefening door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de in artikel 3(2) van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten, in alle gevallen waarin niet tot haar genoegen is aangetoond dat de luchtvaartmaatschappij rechtspersoonlijkheid bezit in en haar hoofdvestiging heeft in Hong Kong.     
(5).  Wanneer een luchtvaartmaatschappij aldus is aangewezen en haar aldus een vergunning is verleend, kan zij beginnen met de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten, mits een overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 7 van deze Overeenkomst vastgesteld tarief voor deze diensten van kracht is.   

### Artikel  5  

####Herroeping of opschorting van een exploitatievergunning

(1).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht een exploitatievergunning te herroepen of de uitoefening van de in artikel 3(2) van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten door een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op te schorten, of door haar noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden te verbinden aan de uitoefening van deze rechten: 

(a) 

(i) met betrekking tot de Regering van Hong Kong: in alle gevallen waarin niet tot haar genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het feitelijk toezicht op, deze luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden of haar onderdanen of bij beide;  

(ii) met betrekking tot de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden: in alle gevallen waarin niet tot haar genoegen is aangetoond dat deze luchtvaartmaatschappij rechtspersoonlijkheid bezit en haar hoofdvestiging heeft in Hong Kong; of    

(b) ingeval deze luchtvaartmaatschappij in gebreke blijft te voldoen aan de wetten of voorschriften van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die deze rechten verleent; of  

(c) ingeval deze luchtvaartmaatschappij anderszins in gebreke blijft de exploitatie te doen geschieden in overeenstemming met de in de Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden.     
(2).  Tenzij onmiddellijke herroeping of opschorting van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde exploitatievergunning of het verbinden van voorwaarden daaraan noodzakelijk is om verdere overtreding van de wetten of voorschriften te voorkomen, worden deze rechten slechts uitgeoefend na overleg met de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  6  

####Beginselen van toepassing op de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten

(1).  Er dient billijke en gelijke gelegenheid te zijn voor de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen om de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes uit te voeren.   
(2).  Bij het exploiteren van de overeengekomen diensten houden de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen rekening met de belangen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, ten einde te voorkomen dat de diensten die de laatstgenoemde maatschappijen op dezelfde route, of op delen daarvan, onderhouden, op onredelijke wijze worden getroffen.   
(3).  De overeengekomen diensten die onderhouden worden door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dienen nauw verband te houden met de eisen van het publiek voor het vervoer op de omschreven routes en hebben in de eerste plaats ten doel het bij een redelijke beladingsgraad verschaffen van capaciteit die toereikend is voor de huidige en redelijkerwijs te verwachten behoefte aan vervoer van passagiers en vracht, met inbegrip van post, naar en uit het gebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen. Het verschaffen van vervoer van passagiers en vracht, met inbegrip van post, zowel opgenomen als afgezet op andere punten op de omschreven routes dan de punten op het gebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen, geschiedt overeenkomstig de algemene beginselen dat de capaciteit dient te zijn afgestemd op: 

(a) de vervoersbehoeften naar en uit het gebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen;  

(b) de vervoersbehoeften van de regio via welke de overeengekomen dienst plaatsvindt, nadat rekening is gehouden met de andere vervoersdiensten die zijn ingesteld door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Staten die tezamen die regio vormen; en  

(c) de eisen die de exploitatie van lange-afstandsdiensten stelt.     
(4).  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen stellen van tijd tot tijd gemeenschappelijk de praktische toepassing vast van de beginselen, vervat in de voorafgaande leden van dit artikel, ten aanzien van de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Tarieven

(1).  Onder „tarief” wordt verstaan: 

(i) de vervoerprijs die door een luchtvaartmaatschappij in rekening wordt gebracht voor het vervoer van passagiers en hun bagage op lijndiensten, alsmede de heffingen en voorwaarden voor de bij dit vervoer bijkomende diensten;  

(ii) de vrachtprijs die door een luchtvaartmaatschappij in rekening wordt gebracht voor het vervoer van vracht (uitgezonderd post) op lijndiensten;  

(iii) de voorwaarden met betrekking tot de beschikbaarheid of toepasbaarheid van deze vervoerprijs of vrachtprijs of prijs, met inbegrip van alle daaraan verbonden voordelen; en  

(iv) de commissie die door een luchtvaartmaatschappij wordt betaald aan een agent met betrekking tot door deze agent verkochte vervoerbewijzen of opgemaakte luchtvrachtbrieven voor het vervoer op lijndiensten.     
(2).  De tarieven te heffen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor vervoer tussen Hong Kong en het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden dienen die te zijn, welke door beide luchtvaartautoriteiten zijn goedgekeurd en zullen worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle relevante factoren, daaronder begrepen de kosten van exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten, de belangen van de gebruikers, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die geheel of gedeeltelijk dezelfde route exploiteren.   
(3).  De in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven kunnen worden overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen die goedkeuring van het tarief verlangen, na overleg met de andere aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen die geheel of gedeeltelijk dezelfde route exploiteren. Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan evenwel niet worden belet een tarief voor te stellen, noch de luchtvaartautoriteiten worden verhinderd een tarief goed te keuren, indien deze luchtvaartmaatschappij er niet in geslaagd is de instemming van de andere aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen met dit tarief te verkrijgen, of omdat er geen andere aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij dezelfde route exploiteert. Met „dezelfde route” in dit en in het voorafgaande lid wordt de gebruikte route en niet de omschreven route bedoeld.   
(4).  Elk voorgesteld tarief voor vervoer tussen Hong Kong en het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden wordt bij de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in zodanige vorm ingediend die de genoemde luchtvaartautoriteiten afzonderlijk kunnen verlangen voor de bekendmaking van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde bijzonderheden. Het dient ten minste 60 dagen (of een zoveel kortere termijn als de luchtvaartautoriteiten kunnen overeenkomen) vóór de voorgestelde datum van inwerkingtreding te worden ingediend. Het voorgestelde tarief wordt behandeld alsof het aan een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is ingediend op de datum waarop het door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van deze Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is ontvangen.   
(5).  Elk tarief, ingediend overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het vierde lid van dit artikel, kan door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op elk tijdstip worden goedgekeurd en, mits het in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in het vierde lid van dit artikel is ingediend, wordt geacht te zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten, tenzij binnen 30 dagen (of een zoveel kortere termijn als de luchtvaartautoriteiten kunnen overeenkomen) na de datum van indiening, één van de luchtvaartautoriteiten een schriftelijke kennisgeving van afkeuring van het voorgestelde tarief heeft betekend aan de ander.   
(6).  Indien kennis van afkeuring wordt gegeven overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het vijfde lid van dit artikel, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van twee Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vaststellen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan binnen 30 dagen na de betekening van de kennisgeving van afkeuring om overleg verzoeken, dat binnen 30 dagen na het verzoek dient plaats te vinden.   
(7).  Indien een tarief door één van de luchtvaartautoriteiten is afgekeurd in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in het vijfde lid van dit artikel en de luchtvaartautoriteiten het tarief niet in onderling overleg hebben kunnen vaststellen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het zesde lid van dit artikel, kan het geschil worden geregeld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(8).  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het negende lid van dit artikel blijft een overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel vastgesteld tarief van kracht totdat een vervangend tarief is vastgesteld.   
(9).  Tenzij met instemming van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en voor een zodanige periode als zij overeen kunnen komen, wordt een tarief niet verlengd krachtens het achtste lid van dit artikel: 

(a) waar een tarief een afloopdatum heeft, met meer dan 12 maanden na deze datum;  

(b) waar een tarief geen afloopdatum heeft, met meer dan 12 maanden na de datum waarop een vervangend tarief bedoeld was van kracht te worden, zoals ingediend bij de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide overeenkomstsluitende Partijen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen van één of beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partij(en).     
(10).  

(a) De tarieven, geheven door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Hong Kong voor vervoer tussen Nederland en een andere Staat zijn onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van Nederland en, indien van toepassing, van de andere Staat. De tarieven die door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Nederland worden geheven voor vervoer tussen Hong Kong en een andere Staat dan Nederland, zijn onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van Hong Kong en, indien van toepassing, van de andere Staat.  

(b) De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende partijen hechten hun goedkeuring aan alle door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ingediende tarieven voor vervoer tussen een punt op het gebied van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en een buiten het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden of Hong Kong gelegen punt, mits: 

(i) aan de desbetreffende luchtvaartmaatschappij vergunning is verleend door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen om dit vervoer te verrichten; en  

(ii) dat tarief identiek is aan het naar behoren goedgekeurde tarief voor dat vervoer, dat wordt geheven door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van het land waarin het andere punt is gelegen, of, indien zulke luchtvaartmaatschappijen er niet zijn, door elke andere luchtvaartmaatschappij waaraan vergunning tot het verrichten van dit vervoer is verleend door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.    

(c) Geen tarief voor dit vervoer wordt goedgekeurd, tenzij het door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij die deze goedkeuring verlangt, bij de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in zodanige vorm is ingediend, als door deze luchtvaartautoriteiten kan worden verlangd voor de bekendmaking van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde bijzonderheden, ten minste 60 dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van inwerkingtreding (of een zoveel kortere termijn als deze luchtvaartautoriteiten in een bijzonder geval kunnen overeenkomen om te voldoen aan het in punt (b) van dit lid gestelde doel).  

(d) De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een overeenkomstig het bepaalde in (a), (b) en (c) van dit lid vastgesteld tarief heeft goedgekeurd, kan zijn goedkeuring intrekken met ingang van dezelfde datum als die waarop het voor haar eigen of voor een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij goedgekeurde tarief niet langer van kracht is.     

### Artikel  8  

####Douanerechten

(1).  Luchtvaartuigen, op internationale luchtdiensten gebruikt door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, hun normale uitrustingsstukken, brandstof, smeermiddelen, reserveonderdelen, met inbegrip van motoren, en proviand (met inbegrip van, doch niet beperkt tot, etenswaren, dranken en tabak) die zich aan boord van een dergelijk luchtvaartuig bevinden, worden op basis van wederkerigheid door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, accijnzen en soortgelijke betalingen en heffingen die niet zijn gebaseerd op de kosten van de bij aankomst verleende diensten, op voorwaarde dat deze uitrustingsstukken en voorraden aan boord van het luchtvaartuig blijven.   
(2).  Normale uitrustingsstukken, reserveonderdelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en proviand, alsmede voorraden gedrukte plaatsbewijzen, luchtvrachtbrieven, alle drukwerken waarop kentekenen van de maatschappij zijn gedrukt, en het gebruikelijke reclamemateriaal dat kosteloos door deze aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij wordt verspreid, ingevoerd op het gebied van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij door of ten behoeve van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of aan boord genomen van het door deze aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuig en uitsluitend bestemd voor het gebruik aan boord van luchtvaartuigen bij het exploiteren van internationale diensten, worden door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op basis van wederkerigheid vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, accijnzen en soortgelijke betalingen en heffingen die niet zijn gebaseerd op de kosten van de bij aankomst verleende diensten, zelfs indien deze voorraden zullen worden gebruikt tijdens die gedeelten van de vlucht die worden afgelegd boven het gebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord zijn genomen. Deze bepaling mag niet zodanig worden uitgelegd, dat een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan worden onderworpen aan de verplichting tot terugbetaling van douanerechten die zijn geheven met betrekking tot de hierboven bedoelde artikelen.   
(3).  Ten aanzien van de in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde artikelen kan worden geëist dat zij onder toezicht of controle van de bevoegde autoriteiten worden gehouden.   
(4).  Normale boorduitrustingsstukken, reserveonderdelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en proviand aan boord van luchtvaartuigen van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van die Partij, die kunnen verlangen, dat deze materialen onder hun toezicht worden gesteld, totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.   

### Artikel  8A  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Inkomsten of winsten uit de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in het internationale verkeer door een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, met inbegrip van deelneming in een ,pool’, een gemeenschappelijke luchtvervoersonderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap, die onderworpen zijn aan belastingheffing op het grondgebied van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zijn vrijgesteld van inkomstenbelasting, winstbelasting en alle andere belastingen op inkomsten of winsten die worden geheven op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
2.  Vermogen en activa van een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in verband met de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in het internationale verkeer zijn vrijgesteld van iedere vorm van belastingen op kapitaal en activa die worden geheven op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
3.  Winsten uit de vervreemding van in het internationale verkeer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen en bij de exploitatie van die luchtvaartuigen behorende roerende zaken die worden ontvangen door een luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zijn alleen op het grondgebied van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij onderworpen aan winstbelasting.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel: 

a. omvat de term ,inkomsten of winsten uit de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in het internationale verkeer’ mede inkomsten of winsten uit de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen voor het vervoer van personen, vee, goederen, post of handelswaar met inbegrip van: 

i. de lease van luchtvaartuigen op charterbasis;  

ii. de verkoop van vervoersbewijzen voor en het verzorgen van diensten in verband met dit vervoer, hetzij voor de luchtvaartmaatschappij zelf hetzij voor enige andere luchtvaartmaatschappij;  

iii. de rente op kapitaal dat onmiddellijk verband houdt met de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in het internationale verkeer;    

b. wordt onder ,internationaal verkeer' verstaan elk vervoer door een luchtvaartuig, tenzij dit vervoer uitsluitend geschiedt tussen plaatsen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

c. wordt onder ,luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij’ verstaan, wat Hong Kong betreft, een luchtvaartmaatschappij met rechtspersoonlijkheid en met haar hoofdvestiging in Hong Kong en, wat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden betreft, een luchtvaartmaatschappij waarvan een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom en het daadwerkelijke toezicht berusten bij de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden of bij zijn onderdanen.     
5.  Dit artikel vindt geen toepassing zolang een Overeenkomst tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen of op winsten die in soortgelijke vrijstellingen voorziet tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van kracht is.   

### Artikel  9  

####Beveiliging van de luchtvaart

De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen elkaar maximale hulp te verlenen met het oog op bestrijding van wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen en van andere wederrechtelijke handelingen tegen luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens en voorzieningen voor de luchtnavigatie, alsmede van bedreiging van de veiligheid van de luchtvaart. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dienen te handelen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen betreffende de beveiliging van de luchtvaart van het Verdrag inzake strafbare feiten en bepaalde andere handelingen, begaan aan boord van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te Tokio op 14 september 1963, het Verdrag tot bestrijding van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te 's-Gravenhage op 16 december 1970, en het Verdrag tot bestrijding van wederrechtelijke gedragingen, gericht tegen de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, ondertekend te Montreal op 23 september 1971. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen slaan tevens acht op de van toepassing zijnde luchtvaartbepalingen vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Wanneer zich gevallen van of bedreigingen tot wederrechtelijk overmeesteren van een luchtvaartuig of andere wederrechtelijke handelingen tegen luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens of voorzieningen voor de luchtnavigatie voordoen, bespoedigen en vergemakkelijken de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen al het berichtenverkeer dat ten doel heeft deze gevallen snel en veilig te beëindigen.  

### Artikel  10  

####De verkoop van diensten voor luchtvervoer

Het staat de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vrij rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van een agent diensten voor luchtvervoer te verkopen op het grondgebied van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.  

### Artikel  11  

####Overmaking van verdiensten

Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Hong Kong heeft het recht, op verzoek, het na aftrek van de plaatselijke uitgaven overblijvende bedrag van de plaatselijke inkomsten in te wisselen en naar Hong Kong over te maken. Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Nederland heeft het recht, op verzoek, het na aftrek van de plaatselijke uitgaven overblijvende bedrag van de plaatselijke inkomsten in te wisselen en naar Nederland over te maken. Inwisseling en overmaking worden zonder beperkingen toegestaan tegen de voor lopende transacties geldende wisselkoers, die van kracht is op het tijdstip waarop deze inkomsten worden aangeboden voor inwisseling en overmaking.  

### Artikel  12  

####Gebruiksheffingen

(1).  Geen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mag de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij gebruiksheffingen opleggen, of toestaan dat deze wordt opgelegd, hoger dan die, welke opgelegd worden aan haar eigen of andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die soortgelijke luchtdiensten exploiteren.   
(2).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bevordert het overleg tussen de tot heffing bevoegde autoriteiten en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen die gebruik maken van de diensten en voorzieningen, waar mogelijk door tussenkomst van de vertegenwoordigende organisaties van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen. Gebruikers dienen een redelijke tijd van tevoren op de hoogte te worden gesteld van enig voorstel tot wijziging van gebruiksheffingen, ten einde hen in staat te stellen hun mening kenbaar te maken alvorens de wijzigingen worden ingevoerd. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij moedigt voorts de tot heffing bevoegde autoriteiten en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen aan toepasselijke gegevens betreffende de gebruiksheffingen uit te wisselen.   

### Artikel  13  

####Consultatie

(1).  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan te allen tijde verzoeken om consultatie inzake de uitvoering, de interpretatie, de toepassing of de wijziging van deze Overeenkomst. Deze consultatie, die kan plaatsvinden tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten, begint binnen een termijn van 60 dagen na de datum waarop de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een schriftelijk verzoek daartoe ontvangt, tenzij anders is overeengekomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
(2).  Elke luchtvaartautoriteit verschaft op verzoek die opgaven van statistieken, die de andere luchtvaartautoriteit redelijkerwijs kan verlangen ten behoeve van de consultaties.   

### Artikel  14  

####Beslechting van geschillen

(1).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen enig geschil rijst met betrekking tot de interpretatie of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil te regelen door onderhandeling.   
(2).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door onderhandeling het geschil te beslechten, kan het door hen worden voorgelegd aan die persoon of instantie waarover zij overeenstemming bereiken, of wordt het, op verzoek van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht, bestaande uit drie scheidsmannen, dat als volgt wordt ingesteld: 

(a) binnen 30 dagen na de ontvangst van een verzoek om arbitrage wijst elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een scheidsman aan. Binnen 60 dagen na de benoeming van de tweede scheidsman wijzen de beide scheidsmannen in onderlinge overeenstemming een derde scheidsman aan, die als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht optreedt;  

(b) indien binnen de hierboven aangegeven limieten enige benoeming niet heeft plaatsgevonden, kan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming binnen 30 dagen te verrichten. Indien de President overweegt dat hij een onderdaan is van een Staat die niet als neutraal kan worden beschouwd met betrekking tot het geschil, geschiedt de benoeming door de oudste Vice-President die niet op deze grond is uitgesloten.     
(3).  Behoudens het hierna in dit artikel bepaalde of zoals anders is overeengekomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, bepaalt het scheidsgerecht de grenzen van zijn rechtsmacht en stelt zijn eigen procedure vast. Op aanwijzing van het scheidsgerecht of op verzoek van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vindt een bijeenkomst plaats voor de vaststelling van de precieze punten welke gearbitreerd moeten worden, en van de specifieke procedures die in acht dienen te worden genomen, uiterlijk 30 dagen nadat het scheidsgerecht volledig is samengesteld.   
(4).  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of is voorgeschreven door het scheidsgerecht, dient elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een memorandum in binnen 45 dagen nadat het scheidsgerecht volledig is samengesteld. De antwoorden dienen binnen 60 dagen daarna binnen te zijn. Het scheidsgerecht houdt zitting op verzoek van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, of naar eigen goeddunken, binnen 30 dagen na de datum waarop de antwoorden binnen moeten zijn.   
(5).  Het scheidsgerecht streeft ernaar een schriftelijke beslissing te geven binnen 30 dagen na afloop van de zitting of, indien er geen zitting is gehouden, na de datum waarop beide antwoorden zijn ingediend, welk van deze tijdstippen het eerst valt. De beslissing dient met een meerderheid van stemmen te worden genomen.   
(6).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kunnen een verzoek om een toelichting op de beslissing indienen binnen 15 dagen na de ontvangst daarvan en deze toelichting dient binnen 15 dagen na dit verzoek te worden verstrekt.   
(7).  De beslissing van het scheidsgerecht is bindend voor de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
(8).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij draagt de kosten van de door haar aangewezen scheidsman. De andere kosten van het scheidsgerecht worden gelijkelijk gedeeld door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, met inbegrip van alle onkosten gemaakt door de President van de Raad voor de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie bij de toepassing van de procedures uit lid 2(b) van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  15
