####Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for the establishment and operation of air services

The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, hereinafter referred to as the Contracting Parties, desiring to stimulate civil air transportation between and beyond their respective territories, hereby conclude the following agreement:    

### Article  1  

1.  Each Contracting Party grants to the other Contracting Party the rights specified in the present Agreement, for the purpose of establishing scheduled international air services on the routes specified in the Annex hereto. Such services and routes are hereafter referred to as “agreed services” and “specified routes” respectively.   
2.  The airlines designated by each Contracting Party shall enjoy, while operating an agreed service on a specified route the following rights: 

(a) to fly without landing across the territory of the other Contracting Party;  

(b) to make stops in the said territory for non-traffic purposes;  

(c) to make stops in the territory of the other Contracting Party for taking on and putting down passengers, mail and cargo in international traffic.     
3.  Nothing in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be deemed to confer on the designated airlines of one Contracting Party the privilege of taking up, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, passengers, cargo or mail carried for remuneration or hire and destined to be set down at another point in the territory of the other Contracting Party.   

### Article  2  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate in writing to the other Contracting Party one or more airlines for the purpose of operating the agreed services on the specified routes.   
2.  On receipt of such designation, the other Contracting Party shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, without delay grant to the airline or airlines designated the appropriate operating authorizations.   
3.  The Aeronautical Authorities of one Contracting Party may require an airline designated by the other Contracting Party to satisfy them that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations normally and reasonably applied to the operation of international air services by such Authorities in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944).   
4.  Each Contracting Party shall have the right to refuse to grant the operating authorizations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise by a designated airline of the rights specified in Article 1, in any case where the said Contracting Party is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of that airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in its nationals.   
5.  When an airline has been so designated and authorized, it may begin at any time to operate the agreed services, provided that a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the present Agreement is in force in respect of that service.   

### Article  3  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall have the right to revoke an operating authorization or to suspend the exercise of the rights specified in Article 1 of the present Agreement by an airline designated by the other Contracting Party, or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise of these rights: 

a. in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of that airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in nationals of such Contracting Party, or  

b. in the case of failure by that airline to comply with the laws or regulations of the Contracting Party granting these rights, or  

c. in case the airline otherwise fails to operate in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the present Agreement.     
2.  Unless immediate revocation, suspension or imposition of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article is essential to prevent further infringements of laws or regulations, such right shall be exercised only after consultation with the other Contracting Party.   

### Article  4  

1.  Aircraft operated on international services by the designated airlines of either Contracting Party, as well as their regular equipment, spare parts, supplies of fuels and lubricants, and aircraft stores (including food, beverages and tobacco) on board such aircraft shall be exempt from all customs duties, inspection fees and other duties or taxes on arriving in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft up to such time as they are re-exported, or are used on the part of the journey performed over that territory.   
2.  Supplies of fuels, lubricants, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores introduced into the territory of one Contracting Party by or on behalf of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party or taken on board the aircraft operated by such designated airline and intended solely for use in the operation of international services shall be exempt from all national duties and charges, including customs duties and inspection fees imposed in the territory of the first Contracting Party, even when these supplies are to be used on the parts of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they are taken on board. The materials referred to above may be required to be kept under customs supervision or control.   
3.  The regular airborne equipment, spare parts, aircraft stores and supplies of fuels and lubricants retained on board the aircraft of either Contracting Party may be unloaded in the territory of the other Contracting Party only with the approval of the customs authorities of that Party, who may require that those materials be placed under their supervision up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with customs regulations.   

### Article  5  

Passengers in transit across the territory of either Contracting Party shall be subject to no more than a very simplified control. Baggage and cargo in direct transit shall be exempt from customs duties and other similar taxes.  

### Article  6  

1.  There shall be fair and equal opportunity for the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties to operate the agreed services on the specified routes between their respective territories.   
2.  In operating the agreed services, the designated airlines of each Contracting Party shall take into account the interests of the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provide on the whole or part of the same routes.   
3.  The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall bear close relationship to the requirements of the public for transportation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of capacity adequate to carry the current and reasonably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail originating from or destined for the territory of the Contracting Party which had designated the airline. Provision for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail both taken up and put down at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating the airline shall be made in accordance with the general principles that capacity shall be related to: – 

a) traffic requirements to and from the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline;  

b) traffic requirements of the area through which the agreed service passes, after taking account of other transport services established by airlines of the States comprising the area; and  

c) the requirements of through airline operation.     

### Article  7  

1.  The tariffs to be charged by the designated airlines of either Contracting Party for the carriage to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be established at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors including cost of operation, reasonable profit and characteristics of service.   
2.  The tariffs referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall, if possible, be agreed by the designated airlines concerned of both Contracting Parties, in consultation with other airlines operating over the whole or part of the route, and such agreement shall, where possible, be reached through the rate-fixing machinery of the International Air Transport Association.   
3.  The tariffs so agreed shall be submitted for the approval of the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties at least ninety (90) days before the proposed date of their introduction; in special cases, this time limit may be reduced, subject to the agreement of the said Authorities.   
4.  If the designated airlines cannot agree on any of these tariffs, or if for some other reason a tariff cannot be fixed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, or if, during the first thirty (30) days of the ninety (90) days' period referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, one Contracting Party gives the other Contracting Party notice of its dissatisfaction with any tariff agreed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties shall try to determine the tariff by agreement between themselves.   
5.  If the Aeronautical Authorities cannot agree on the approval of any tariff submitted to them under paragraph 3 of this Article and on the determination of any tariff under paragraph 4, the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the present Agreement.   
6.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, no tariff shall come into force if the Aeronautical Authorities of either Contracting Party have not approved it.   
7.  The tariffs established in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall remain in force until new tariffs have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

Either Contracting Party undertakes to grant to the other Contracting Party free transfer, at the official rate of exchange, of the excess of receipts over expenditure achieved on its territory in connection with the carriage of passengers, baggage, mail and cargo by a designated airline of the other Contracting Party. Wherever the payments system between the Contracting Parties is governed by a special agreement, the special agreement shall apply.  

### Article  9  

In a spirit of close co-operation, the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties shall consult each other from time to time with a view to ensuring the implementation of, and satisfactory compliance with, the provisions of the present Agreement and the Annex thereto.  

### Article  10  

If either of the Contracting Parties considers it desirable to modify any provision of the present Agreement, or its Annex, it may request consultation with the other Contracting Party; such consultation, which may be between the Aeronautical Authorities and which may be through discussion or by correspondence, shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days of the date of the request. Any modifications so agreed shall come into force when they have been confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes, which, in the case of modification of the Agreement, shall state that the formalities required by the national legislation of each Contracting Party have been accomplished.  

### Article  11  

1.  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation.   
2.  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to some person or body, or the dispute may at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each Contracting Party and the third to be appointed by the two so nominated. Each of the Contracting Parties shall nominate an arbitrator within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other of a notice through diplomatic channels requesting arbitration of the dispute, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed within a further period of sixty (60) days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to nominate an arbitrator within the period specified or if the third arbitrator is not appointed within the period specified, the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization may be requested by either Contracting Party to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case requires. In such case, the third arbitrator shall be a national of a third State and shall act as president of the arbitral body.   
3.  The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision given under paragraph 2 of this Article.   

### Article  12  

The present Agreement and its Annex shall be deemed to be amended without further agreement as may be necessary to conform with any multilateral convention or agreement which may become binding on both Contracting Parties.  

### Article  13  

Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other Contracting Party of its decision to terminate the present Agreement; such notice shall be simultaneously communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organization. In such case the Agreement shall terminate twelve (12) months after the date of receipt of the notice by the other Contracting Party, unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by agreement before the expiry of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

####Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van Trinidad en Tobago inzake de instelling en exploitatie van luchtdiensten

De Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van Trinidad en Tobago, hierna te noemen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, verlangend het burgerluchtvervoer tussen en via hun onderscheiden grondgebieden te bevorderen, sluiten hierbij de volgende overeenkomst:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verleent aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de in deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten voor het instellen van geregelde internationale luchtdiensten op de routes die zijn omschreven in de bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst. Zulke diensten en routes worden hierna onderscheidenlijk „de overeengekomen diensten” en „de omschreven routes” genoemd.   
2.  De door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen hebben, bij de exploitatie van een overeengekomen dienst op een omschreven route, de volgende rechten: 

(a) om zonder te landen over het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te vliegen;  

(b) om op dat grondgebied te landen voor andere dan verkeersdoeleinden;  

(c) om op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te landen voor het opnemen en afzetten van passagiers, post en vracht in internationaal verkeer.     
3.  Geen der in lid 2 van dit artikel vervatte bepalingen wordt geacht de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het recht te geven tot het opnemen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van passagiers, vracht of post tegen vergoeding of beloning en bestemd om op een ander punt op het grondgebied van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te worden afgezet.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is gerechtigd aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij schriftelijk mededeling te doen van de aanwijzing van een of meer luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes.   
2.  Na ontvangst van een dergelijke aanwijzing verleent de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, met inachtneming van het bepaalde in de leden 3 en 4 van dit artikel, onverwijld de vereiste exploitatievergunning aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
3.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kunnen eisen dat een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij hun aantoont dat zij in staat is te voldoen aan de voorwaarden die worden gesteld bij de wetten en voorschriften welke door deze autoriteiten gewoonlijk en op redelijke wijze ten aanzien van de exploitatie van internationale luchtdiensten overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart (Chicago, 1944) worden toegepast.   
4.  In elk geval waarin niet ten genoegen van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of bij haar onderdanen, heeft eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht de exploitatievergunning bedoeld in lid 2 van dit artikel te weigeren, of de door haar noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden te verbinden aan de uitoefening van de in artikel 1 bedoelde rechten door die aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij.   
5.  Wanneer een luchtvaartmaatschappij is aangewezen en haar een vergunning is verleend, kan zij op ieder ogenblik een aanvang maken met de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten, mits ten aanzien van die dienst een tarief, vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 7 van deze Overeenkomst, van kracht is.   

### Artikel  3  

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht een exploitatievergunning te herroepen, of de uitoefening van de in artikel 1 van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten door een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op te schorten, of ten aanzien van de uitoefening van die rechten de voorwaarden te stellen die zij noodzakelijk acht: 

(a) in elk geval waarin niet tot haar genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van en het daadwerkelijke toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij aanwijst, of bij haar onderdanen; of  

(b) ingeval die luchtvaartmaatschappij in gebreke blijft de wetten en voorschriften van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij welke die rechten verleent na te komen; of  

(c) ingeval de luchtvaartmaatschappij anderszins in gebreke blijft de exploitatie te voeren in overeenstemming met de in deze Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden.     
2.  Dit recht wordt slechts uitgeoefend na overleg met de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij onmiddellijke herroeping, opschorting of het stellen van de in lid 1 van dit artikel genoemde voorwaarden noodzakelijk is om hernieuwde inbreuken op de wetten of voorschriften te voorkomen.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  Luchtvaartuigen die door de door een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen op internationale diensten worden gebruikt, en hun normale uitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, voorraden motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen, proviand (met inbegrip van etenswaren, dranken en tabaksartikelen) die zich aan boord bevinden van die luchtvaartuigen, zijn bij binnenkomst op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, inspectiekosten en andere rechten en heffingen, onder voorwaarde dat die uitrustingsstukken en voorraden aan boord van de luchtvaartuigen blijven totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd, of dat zij worden gebruikt op dat deel van de vlucht dat boven dat grondgebied wordt afgelegd.   
2.  Voorraden motorbrandstof, smeermiddelen, reservedelen, normale uitrustingsstukken en proviand die in het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden ingevoerd door of namens een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, of aan boord genomen worden van de luchtvaartuigen geëexploiteerd door zulk een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, en die uitsluitend bestemd zijn voor gebruik bij de exploitatie van internationale diensten zijn vrijgesteld van alle nationale rechten en heffingen, daaronder begrepen douanerechten en inspectiekosten, opgelegd op het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zelfs wanneer die voorraden zullen worden gebruikt op de delen van de vlucht die boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord worden genomen worden afgelegd. Verlangd kan worden dat de bovengenoemde goederen onder douanetoezicht of -controle blijven.   
3.  De normale boorduitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, proviand en voorraden motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen die zich aan boord van de luchtvaartuigen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bevinden kunnen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van die Partij, die kunnen eisen dat die goederen onder hun toezicht worden gesteld, totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.   

### Artikel  5  

Passagiers op doorreis via het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden slechts aan een eenvoudige controle onderworpen. Bagage en vracht die rechtstreeks worden doorgevoerd zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en andere soortgelijke heffingen.  

### Artikel  6  

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden op billijke wijze en gelijkelijk in de gelegenheid gesteld de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden te exploiteren.   
2.  Bij het exploiteren van de overeengekomen diensten houden de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen rekening met de belangen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zodat de diensten die de laatstgenoemde maatschappijen op dezelfde routes of delen daarvan onderhouden hierdoor niet op onredelijke wijze worden getroffen.   
3.  De overeengekomen diensten die worden onderhouden door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen dienen nauwkeurig te worden afgestemd op de vervoersbehoeften op de omschreven routes en hebben als eerste doel de verschaffing, met inachtneming van een redelijke beladingsgraad, van capaciteit die voldoet aan de huidige en redelijkerwijs te verwachten behoeften aan vervoer van passagiers, vracht en post afkomstig van of bestemd voor de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij had aangewezen. Er wordt capaciteit voor het vervoer van passagiers, vracht en post, opgenomen zowel als afgezet op punten op de omschreven routes op het grondgebied van andere Staten dan die welke de luchtvaartmaatschappij aanwijst, verschaft overeenkomstig de algemene beginselen dat de capaciteit dient te zijn afgestemd op: 

a. de vervoersbehoeften naar en van het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen;  

b. de vervoersbehoeften van het gebied via hetwelk de overeengekomen dienst gaat, nadat rekening is gehouden met andere vervoersdiensten die zijn ingesteld door luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Staten die te zamen dit gebied vormen; en  

c. de eisen welke de exploitatie van lange-afstandsdiensten stelt.     

### Artikel  7  

1.  De tarieven te heffen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor vervoer naar of uit het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden vastgesteld op redelijk niveau, waarbij behoorlijk rekening wordt gehouden met alle in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, en de kenmerkende eigenschappen van de diensten.   
2.  De in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, in onderlinge overeenstemming vastgesteld door de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, in overleg met andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de gehele route of delen daarvan exploiteren, en die overeenstemming dient, zo mogelijk, te worden bereikt door middel van de procedure van de „International Air Transport Association” ter vaststelling van de tarieven.   
3.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden tenminste negentig (90) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd; in bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, behoudens toestemming van de genoemde autoriteiten.   
4.  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent een of meer van deze tarieven, of indien om een andere reden een tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel, of indien gedurende de eerste dertig (30) dagen van de periode van negentig (90) dagen, genoemd in lid 3 van dit artikel, de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de andere mededeelt dat zij een tarief, vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel, onbevredigend acht, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
5.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een hun ingevolge lid 3 van dit artikel voorgelegd tarief of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief ingevolge lid 4, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 11 van deze Overeenkomst.   
6.  Geen nieuw tarief wordt van kracht indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dit niet hebben goedgekeurd, behoudens het bepaalde in lid 5 van dit artikel.   
7.  De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

Elk der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbindt zich de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht te verlenen tot het vrijelijk overmaken tegen de officiële wisselkoers van de netto-inkomsten op haar grondgebied verworven ten gevolge van het vervoer van passagiers, bagage, post en vracht door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. In alle gevallen waarin het betalingsverkeer tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen door een bijzondere overeenkomst wordt geregeld, is deze bijzondere overeenkomst van toepassing.  

### Artikel  9  

In een geest van nauwe samenwerking raadplegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander van tijd tot tijd om de uitvoering en bevredigende naleving van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de Bijlage daarbij te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  10  

Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het wenselijk acht bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst of van de Bijlage te wijzigen, kan zij de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om overleg verzoeken; dit overleg, dat kan plaatsvinden tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten, kan zowel mondeling als schriftelijk geschieden, en vangt aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek. Alle zodanig overeengekomen wijzigingen worden van kracht wanneer zij zijn bevestigd door middel van een diplomatieke notawisseling, in welke nota's, in geval van wijziging van de Overeenkomst, wordt verklaard dat de door de nationale wetgeving van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vereiste formaliteiten zijn vervuld.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen eerst dit geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen, kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan een bepaalde persoon of instantie; het geschil kan ook op verzoek van een der Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht van drie scheidsrechters, van wie elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er een aanwijst terwijl de derde door de twee aldus aangewezen scheidsrechters wordt benoemd. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen benoemt een scheidsrechter binnen zestig (60) dagen na het tijdstip waarop zij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij langs diplomatieke weg een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen, waarin om een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing in het geschil wordt verzocht, en de derde scheidsrechter wordt binnen het daaraan aansluitende tijdvak van eveneens zestig (60) dagen benoemd. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat binnen het aangegeven tijdvak een scheidsrechter aan te wijzen, of indien de derde scheidsrechter niet binnen het aangegeven tijdvak is benoemd, kan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een verzoek richten tot de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie om een scheidsrechter of eventueel scheidsrechters te benoemen. In dat geval dient de derde scheidsrechter onderdaan te zijn van een derde staat en dient hij op te treden als President van het Scheidsgerecht.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe, zich aan iedere ingevolge lid 2 van dit artikel genomen beslissing te houden.   

### Artikel  12  

Deze Overeenkomst en haar Bijlage worden geacht te zijn gewijzigd zonder verdere overeenkomst indien zulks nodig is om deze te doen aansluiten bij eventuele multilaterale verdragen of overeenkomsten die in de toekomst voor de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbindend kunnen worden.  

### Artikel  13  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te allen tijde mededeling doen van haar besluit deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen; deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In een dergelijk geval treedt de Overeenkomst buiten werking twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling in onderling overleg voor het einde van deze termijn wordt ingetrokken. Indien van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen ontvangstbevestiging wordt ontvangen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
