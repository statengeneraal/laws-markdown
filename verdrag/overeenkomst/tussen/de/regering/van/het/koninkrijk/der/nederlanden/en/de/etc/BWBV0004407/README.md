### Artikel  9  

Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mag alleen van een toestel van een andere capaciteit gebruik maken van een punt binnen het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op voorwaarde dat: 

(a) daarvoor gegronde redenen uit economische overwegingen ten aanzien van de exploitatie aanwezig zijn;  

(b) de luchtvaartuigen waarvan op het gedeelte dat op grotere afstand van het eindpunt van de route op het grondgebied van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ligt gebruik gemaakt wordt, van een geringere capaciteit zijn dan de luchtvaartuigen welke gebruikt worden op het dichterbij gelegen gedeelte;  

(c) de luchtvaartuigen met de geringere capaciteit slechts dienst doen in aansluiting op de luchtvaartuigen met de grotere capaciteit en dat de dienstregeling dienovereenkomstig wordt vastgesteld; de eerstgenoemde luchtvaartuigen dienen het wisselpunt aan te doen voor het vervoer van de lading overgeladen uit of bestemd voor overlading in de luchtvaartuigen met grotere capaciteit; de capaciteit van deze luchtvaartuigen dient in de eerste plaats op dit doel te zijn afgestemd;  

(d) er een voldoende volume van doorgaand verkeer is; en  

(e) op alle regelingen die verband houden met een verandering van type, de bepalingen van artikel 8 van deze Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn.    

### Artikel  10  

(1).  De tarieven voor alle overeengekomen diensten worden vastgesteld op redelijk niveau, waarbij behoorlijk rekening wordt gehouden met alle in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, de kenmerkende eigenschappen van de dienst (zoals maatstaven voor snelheid en accommodatie) en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig gedeelte van de omschreven route. Deze tarieven worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de hierna volgende bepalingen van dit artikel.   
(2).  De in lid 1 van dit artikel vermelde tarieven, evenals de tarieven van agentencommissies die daarop worden verleend, worden, indien mogelijk, ten aanzien van elk der omschreven routes in onderlinge overeenstemming vastgesteld door de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen, in overleg met andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die een gehele route of een gedeelte daarvan exploiteren, en die overeenstemming dient, zo mogelijk, te worden bereikt door middel van de procedure van de „International Air Transport Association” ter vaststelling van de tarieven. De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd.   
(3).  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent een van deze tarieven, of indien om een andere reden omtrent een tarief geen overeenstemming kan worden bereikt overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel, zullen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen trachten in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
(4).  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een hun volgens lid 2 van dit artikel voorgelegd tarief of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief volgens lid 3, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(5).  Geen tarief zal van kracht worden indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen daarmede niet tevreden zijn, behoudens op grond van de bepalingen van lid 3 van artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(6).  De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  11  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verleent de door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen het recht aan hun hoofdkantoren tegen de op de dag van de remise geldende officiële wisselkoers het bedrag van de netto inkomsten over te maken in welke valuta deze ook verdiend mogen zijn.  

### Artikel  12  

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verstrekken aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op een daartoe strekkend verzoek periodieke of andere statistische gegevens welke redelijkerwijs kunnen worden verlangd om te kunnen beoordelen of eventueel veranderingen dienen te worden aangebracht in de capaciteit welke door de door eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor het onderhouden van de overeengekomen diensten ter beschikking wordt gesteld.  

### Artikel  13  

Ten einde een nauwe samenwerking te verzekeren ten aanzien van alles wat op de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft, vindt regelmatig en veelvuldig overleg plaats tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.  

### Artikel  14  

(1).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats het geschil te regelen door onderling overleg.   
(2).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van overleg een regeling te treffen, 

(a) kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan een onderling overeengekomen scheidsgerecht of aan een andere persoon of instantie; of  

(b) indien daaromtrent geen overeenstemming wordt bereikt, of, indien wordt overeengekomen het geschil aan een scheidsgerecht voor te leggen, doch geen overeenstemming kan worden bereikt omtrent de samenstelling daarvan, kan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan iedere daartoe bevoegde rechtbank die in de toekomst binnen de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie kan worden ingesteld, of, bij gebrek aan een zodanige rechtbank, aan de Raad van die Organisatie.     
(3).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verbinden zich, zich te houden aan iedere ingevolge lid 2 van dit artikel gegeven beslissing.   
(4).  Indien en zolang een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of een door een van deze partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij geen gevolg mocht geven aan een ingevolge lid 2 van dit artikel gegeven beslissing, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij alle rechten of voorrechten die zij krachtens deze Overeenkomst verleend heeft aan de in gebreke blijvende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of aan de door deze aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen, of aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij die in gebreke is gebleven, beperken, onthouden of intrekken.   

### Artikel  15  

(1).  Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het wenselijk acht de voorwaarden van deze Overeenkomst te wijzigen, kan zij om overleg verzoeken tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen omtrent de voorgestelde wijziging. Dit overleg vangt aan binnen een termijn van zestig dagen te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek af. Iedere wijziging in deze Overeenkomst wordt van kracht wanneer beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkaar hebben medegedeeld, dat aan hun onderscheiden grondwettelijke voorschriften is voldaan.   
(2).  Indien een algemeen multilateraal luchtvaartverdrag voor beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van kracht zou worden, wordt deze Overeenkomst zodanig gewijzigd dat zij aansluit aan de bepalingen van dat verdrag.   

### Artikel  16  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan te allen tijde aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mededeling doen dat zij deze Overeenkomst wenst te beëindigen. Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Indien een dergelijke mededeling wordt gedaan loopt de Overeenkomst af twaalf maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling in onderling overleg vóór het einde van deze termijn wordt ingetrokken. Indien van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen ontvangstbevestiging wordt ontvangen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.  

### Artikel  17
