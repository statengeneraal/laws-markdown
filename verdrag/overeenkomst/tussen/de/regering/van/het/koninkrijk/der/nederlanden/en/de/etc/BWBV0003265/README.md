### Artikel  6  

####Tarieven

1.  De tarieven die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in rekening worden gebracht voor het vervoer tussen hun grondgebieden dienen die tarieven te zijn welke zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en dienen te worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle ter zake dienende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de omschreven route.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven dienen zo mogelijk te worden overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. De luchtvaartmaatschappijen kunnen andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen raadplegen die de routes, geheel of ten dele, exploiteren. Wanneer een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen, worden de tarieven opgesteld door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij (en) van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.In ieder geval dienen de tarieven te worden goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Alle aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ten minste vijfenveertig (45) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering daarvan, behalve wanneer genoemde autoriteiten overeenkomen deze termijn in bijzondere gevallen te bekorten.   
4.  De goedkeuring van tarieven kan uitdrukkelijk worden gegeven; doch indien geen van beide luchtvaartautoriteiten kennis van afkeuring heeft gegeven binnen dertig (30) dagen na de datum van voorlegging, overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, worden de tarieven geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Ingeval de termijn voor voorlegging wordt bekort, zoals bepaald in het derde lid van dit artikel, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de termijn waarbinnen kennisgeving van afkeuring moet geschieden, overeenkomstig wordt bekort.   
5.  Indien geen tarief kan worden overeengekomen in overeenstemming met het tweede lid van dit artikel of indien gedurende de krachtens het vierde lid van dit artikel van toepassing zijnde termijn de ene luchtvaartautoriteit de andere luchtvaartautoriteit kennisgeeft van haar afkeuring van een in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over een krachtens het derde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief of over de vaststelling van een tarief krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld overeenkomstig artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst.   
7.  Krachtens dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven in rekening brengen die verschillen van die welke zijn goedgekeurd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  7  

####Commerciële activiteiten

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen: 

a. op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kantoren vestigen voor de bevordering van het luchtvervoer en de verkoop van vliegbiljetten, alsmede andere voorzieningen tot stand brengen die nodig zijn voor het verzorgen van luchtvervoer;  

b. op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij rechtstreeks en, naar goeddunken van die luchtvaartmaatschappij, via haar agenten, zich bezighouden met de verkoop van luchtvervoer.

3.  In deze behoefte aan personeel kan naar goeddunken van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) worden voorzien door haar eigen personeel, dan wel door gebruikmaking van de diensten van een andere organisatie, onderneming of luchtvaartmaatschappij die op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij haar bedrijf uitoefent en gemachtigd is deze diensten op het grondgebied van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te verrichten.   
4.  Bovengenoemde activiteiten worden verricht in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
5.  Beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zien af van het vereiste van arbeidsvergunningen, bezoekervisa of andere soortgelijke documenten voor personeel dat bepaalde tijdelijke diensten of taken verricht, behalve in door de betrokken nationale autoriteiten te bepalen bijzondere omstandigheden. Wanneer zulke vergunningen, visa of documenten vereist zijn, worden zij onverwijld en kosteloos verstrekt, opdat de binnenkomst van het betrokken personeel in de Staat niet wordt vertraagd.   

### Artikel  8  

####Eerlijke concurrentie

Bedoelde goedkeuring wordt niet op onredelijke gronden geweigerd.   
2.  Verzoeken om toestemming voor het uitvoeren van extra vluchten kunnen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) rechtstreeks aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ter goedkeuring worden voorgelegd.

Ten aanzien van bovengenoemde goederen kan worden verlangd dat deze onder toezicht en beheer van de douane blijven. De bepalingen van dit lid mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat aan een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de verplichting kan worden opgelegd douanerechten terug te betalen die reeds op de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde goederen zijn geheven.   
3.  Normale boorduitrustingsstukken, reserve-onderdelen, voorraden motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen en proviand aan boord van luchtvaartuigen van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kunnen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van die Partij, die kunnen verlangen dat deze goederen onder hun toezicht worden geplaatst, totdat deze weder worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.

####Beveiliging

1.  Overeenkomstig hun rechten en verplichtingen krachtens het internationale recht bevestigen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen opnieuw dat hun verplichting jegens elkaar tot bescherming van de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart tegen daden van wederrechtelijke inmenging een wezenlijk deel van deze Overeenkomst uitmaakt.

2.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlenen elkaar op verzoek alle nodige bijstand ten einde gedragingen van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van burgerluchtvaartuigen en andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van deze luchtvaartuigen, de passagiers en de bemanning daarvan, luchthavens en voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart, alsmede elke andere bedreiging voor de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, te voorkomen.   
3.  De Partijen handelen in hun onderlinge betrekkingen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart, vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie en aangeduid als Bijlagen bij het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart, voor zover deze veiligheidsbepalingen van toepassing zijn op de Partijen; zij dienen te verlangen dat de exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen die in hun land zijn geregistreerd of die hun hoofdzetel of domicilie op hun grondgebied hebben, en de exploitanten van luchthavens op hun grondgebied handelen in overeenstemming met deze bepalingen inzake beveiliging van de luchtvaart.   
4.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stemt ermede in dat deze exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen de bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart, als bedoeld in het derde lid en vereist door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, in acht dienen te nemen bij de binnenkomst op, het verlaten van of gedurende het verblijf op het grondgebied van deze andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt tevens elk verzoek van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om binnen redelijke grenzen bijzondere veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen ten einde aan een bijzondere dreiging het hoofd te bieden, in welwillende overweging.   
5.  Wanneer zich een voorval voordoet van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van burgerluchtvaartuigen of van andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van die luchtvaartuigen, de passagiers en bemanning daarvan, luchthavens of voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart, of dreigt zich voor te doen, verlenen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander bijstand door het berichtenverkeer en andere passende maatregelen te vergemakkelijken, bedoeld om op snelle en veilige wijze een einde te maken aan een dergelijk voorval of de dreiging daarvan.   

### Artikel  16  

####Overleg en wijziging

1.  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd overleg met elkander ten einde te verzekeren dat de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst worden uitgevoerd en op bevredigende wijze worden nageleefd; wanneer nodig plegen zij overleg omtrent wijziging van de Overeenkomst.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan verzoeken om overleg, dat begint binnen zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek, tenzij beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen instemmen met een verlenging of bekorting van deze termijn.

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil ontstaat met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dit in de eerste plaats te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen. Indien die onderhandelingen geen resultaat hebben, kunnen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het geschil voor advies voorleggen aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie of een andere derde.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen tot een regeling te komen door middel van onderhandeling, of de in het eerste lid bedoelde voorlegging voor advies, wordt het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een gerecht van drie scheidsmannen, van wie elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij er een benoemt, waarna de derde wordt aangewezen door de twee aldus benoemde scheidsmannen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen benoemt een scheidsman binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum waarop de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij langs diplomatieke weg een nota heeft ontvangen waarin om een scheidsrechterlijke uitspraak in het geschil door bedoeld scheidsgerecht wordt verzocht, en de derde scheidsman dient te worden aangewezen binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen. Indien één van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen niet binnen de genoemde termijn een scheidsman benoemt, of indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen de genoemde termijn wordt aangewezen, kan op verzoek van één van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de Voorzitter van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie een scheidsman of scheidsmannen aanwijzen, naar gelang het geval. In alle gevallen dient de derde scheidsman onderdaan te zijn van een derde Staat en op te treden als Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht. Het scheidsgerecht doet verslag binnen drie (3) maanden na zijn benoeming.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen houden zich aan elke beslissing gegeven op grond van het tweede lid van dit artikel.   
4.  De kosten van het scheidsgerecht worden gelijkelijk door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gedragen.

Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In dit geval eindigt de Overeenkomst twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling van opzegging in onderling overleg voor het einde van dit tijdvak wordt ingetrokken. Indien de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij nalaat de ontvangst te bevestigen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
