Een zodanige overmaking zal geschieden tegen de officiële wisselkoers indien een dergelijke koers bestaat of anders tegen een koers die gelijk is aan die waartegen de ontvangsten werden geboekt. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht bijkantoren te vestigen en te exploiteren met een eigen staf alsmede een algemene verkoopagent en een agent voor de gronddiensten aan te stellen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Ingeval wetten of voorschriften uitgevaardigd door een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verhinderen een van bovengenoemde rechten te genieten, zullen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij evenmin dergelijke rechten genieten.  

### Artikel  8  

(1).  De tarieven voor een overeengekomen dienst moeten worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij behoorlijk rekening dient te worden gehouden met alle in aanmerking komende factoren waaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, de kenmerken van de dienst (zoals de snelheidsnormen en de accommodatie) en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen op een deel van de omschreven route. Deze tarieven zullen worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de volgende bepalingen van dit artikel.   
(2).  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel vermelde tarieven, evenals 4e van toepassing zijnde tarieven van de agentenprovisie die ten aanzien daarvan gebruikelijk zijn, dienen, indien mogelijk, te worden vastgesteld in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen ten aanzien van elk van de omschreven routes en bij deze overeenstemming dient, zo mogelijk, te worden uitgegaan van besluiten, die van toepassing zijn krachtens de procedure van de vervoersconferentie van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging („International Air Transport Association”). De aldus vastgestelde tarieven dienen de goedkeuring te verwerven van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
(3).  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent één of meer van deze tarieven, of indien om een andere reden een tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
(4).  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een hun volgens het tweede lid van dit artikel voorgelegd tarief of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief volgens het derde lid, wordt het geschil beslecht overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 11 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(5).  Geen tarief wordt van kracht indien het door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen niet bevredigend wordt geacht, zulks onverminderd het bepaalde in het derde lid van artikel 11 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(6).  De overeenkomstig het in dit artikel bepaalde, vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel.   

### Artikel  9  

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verschaffen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op een daartoe strekkend verzoek periodieke of andere statistische gegevens welke redelijkerwijze kunnen worden verlangd om te kunnen beoordelen of eventueel veranderingen dienen te worden aangebracht in de capaciteit door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschaft op de overeengekomen diensten. Deze gegevens dienen alle inlichtingen te bevatten die nodig zijn voor het bepalen van het aantal passagiers en de hoeveelheid post en vracht, die door die luchtvaartmaatschappij op de overeengekomen diensten zijn vervoerd.  

### Artikel  10  

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen plegen geregeld en veelvuldig onderling overleg, ter verzekering van een nauwe samenwerking inzake alles wat de tenuitvoerlegging van deze Overeenkomst betreft.  

### Artikel  11  

(1).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil onderling te regelen.   
(2).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van overleg een regeling te treffen, kunnen zij het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan een persoon of instantie, of kan het geschil op verzoek van een der Partijen ter beslissing voorgelegd worden aan een scheidsgerecht van drie scheidslieden, van wie een door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen en de derde door de twee aldus aangewezen scheidsrechters wordt benoemd. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen benoemt binnen zestig dagen na het tijdstip waarop zij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, langs diplomatieke weg, een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen, waarin om voorlegging van het geschil aan een zodanig scheidsgerecht wordt verzocht, een scheidsman en de derde scheidsman wordt binnen het daaraan aansluitende tijdvak van dertig dagen benoemd. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat binnen het aangegeven tijdvak een scheidsman aan te wijzen, of indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen het aangegeven tijdvak wordt benoemd, kan door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een verzoek worden gericht tot de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie om een scheidsman of eventueel scheidslieden te benoemen. Indien de President de nationaliteit van een der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bezit of anderszins verhinderd is zijn functie uit te oefenen verricht zijn plaatsvervanger de noodzakelijke benoemingen. De derde scheidsman dient een onderdaan te zijn van een derde Staat en hij dient op te treden als President van het arbitrale lichaam.   
(3).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verplichten zich ertoe om zich te houden aan iedere ingevolge het tweede lid van dit artikel genomen beslissing.   
(4).  Indien en voor zolang een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat te voldoen aan de beslissing genomen krachtens het tweede lid van dit artikel, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij rechten of voorrechten, verleend krachtens deze Overeenkomst aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die in gebreke blijft of aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij die in gebreke blijft, beperken, onthouden of intrekken.   

### Artikel  12  

(1).  Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het wenselijk acht een bepaling van deze Overeenkomst te wijzigen, verzoekt zij om overleg met de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Zodanig overleg, dat kan worden gevoerd tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten, dient een aanvang te nemen binnen een periode van zestig dagen te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek. Wijzigingen die op deze wijze zijn overeengekomen worden van kracht nadat zij door een diplomatieke notawisseling bevestigd zijn.   
(2).  Deze Overeenkomst wordt zo nodig zodanig gewijzigd dat zij aansluit bij algemene multilaterale verdragen die beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de toekomst zouden kunnen binden.   

### Artikel  13  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan te allen tijde aan de andere mededeling doen dat zij deze Overeenkomst wenst te beëindigen. Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Indien een zodanige mededeling wordt gedaan, loopt deze Overeenkomst af 12 maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling inzake beëindiging in onderling overleg voor het einde van deze termijn wordt ingetrokken. Indien van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen ontvangstbevestiging wordt ontvangen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen 14 dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
