### Artikel  VIII  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij draagt aan de door haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zo tijdig mogelijk voorafgaande aan de opening van de overeengekomen diensten mededeling te doen van het type dienst, het type van de te bezigen luchtvaartuigen en de dienstregeling der vluchten op de te exploiteren overeengekomen diensten.

### Artikel  X  

1.  In de volgende leden wordt aan de term „tarief” de volgende betekenis gehecht: prijzen betaald voor het vervoer van passagiers, bagage en vracht en de voorwaarden waarop deze prijzen van toepassing zijn, met inbegrip van de prijzen en voorwaarden voor agentschappen of andere hulpdiensten, doch met uitsluiting van de vergoeding of voorwaarden voor het vervoer van post.   
2.  De tarieven te heffen door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de ene Partij voor vervoer naar of uit het grondgebied van de andere Partij worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
3.  De in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, in onderlinge overeenstemming vastgesteld door de betrokken aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, na overleg met de andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de gehele route of een gedeelte daarvan exploiteren, en die overeenstemming dient, zo mogelijk, te worden bereikt door middel van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging („International Air Transport Association”) ter vaststelling van de tarieven.   
4.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd ten minste negentig dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering. In bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, behoudens toestemming van de genoemde autoriteiten.   
5.  Deze goedkeuring kan uitdrukkelijk worden gegeven. Indien geen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig dagen na de datum van voorlegging overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel haar afkeuring heeft uitgesproken, worden deze tarieven als goedgekeurd beschouwd. Ingeval het tijdvak van voorlegging is verkort, als bedoeld in het vierde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de periode waarin de afkeuring moet worden medegedeeld korter zal zijn dan dertig dagen.   
6.  Indien een tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, of indien gedurende het tijdvak bedoeld in het vijfde lid, een der luchtvaartautoriteiten de andere luchtvaartautoriteit kennis geeft van haar afkeuring van een tarief, waarover overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het derde lid overeenstemming is bereikt, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Partijen, na overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van enige andere Staat wier advies zij nuttig beschouwen, in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
7.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over een tarief dat hun is voorgelegd overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel, of over de vaststelling van een tarief volgens het zesde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel XV.   
8.  Een tarief vastgesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel, blijft van kracht tot een nieuw tarief is vastgesteld. De geldigheidsduur van een tarief wordt echter krachtens dit lid niet verlengd met meer dan twaalf maanden na de datum waarop anders het tarief zou zijn vervallen.   

### Artikel  XI  

Passagiers op doorreis over het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden ten hoogste onderworpen aan een zeer vereenvoudigde douanecontrole. Bagage en lading in direct transitoverkeer zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en andere soortgelijke heffingen.  

### Artikel  XII  

Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen neemt op zich aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrije overmaking toe te staan, tegen de officiële wisselkoers, van het batig saldo van ontvangsten en uitgaven, geboekt op haar gebied in verband met het vervoer van passagiers, bagage, post en vracht. Indien het betalingsstelsel tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is geregeld door een afzonderlijk verdrag, is dit afzonderlijk verdrag van toepassing.  

### Artikel  XIII  

In een geest van nauwe samenwerking wisselen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen regelmatig van gedachten omtrent de toepassing en de uitlegging van deze Overeenkomst.
