####Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of Pakistan relating to air services

The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of Pakistan, hereinafter described as the Contracting Parties, Being Contracting Parties to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and the International Air Services Transit Agreement, both signed at Chicago on the seventh day of December 1944, the terms of which Convention and Agreement are binding on both Parties, And desiring to conclude an agreement for the operation of air transport services between and beyond their respective territories,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

Each Contracting Party grants to the other Contracting Party the right to operate the air services specified in the Annex to this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “specified air services”) on the routes specified in the said Annex (hereinafter referred to as the “specified air routes”).  

### Article  II  

(A).  Each of the specified air services may be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the Contracting Party to whom the rights are granted, on condition that: 

1. The Contracting Party to whom the rights have been granted shall have designated an airline (hereinafter referred to as a „designated airline”) for the specified air routes.  

2. The Contracting Party which grants the rights shall have given the appropriate operating permission to the airline, which it shall do with the least possible delay, provided that the airline has, if called upon, complied with the requirements of paragraph (B) of this Article.     
(B).  The designated airline may be required to satisfy the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Party granting the rights that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed by or under the laws and regulations normally applied by those authorities to the operation of international air services.   
(C).  The operation of each of the specified air services shall be subject to the agreement of the Contracting Party concerned that the route organisation available for civil aviation on the specified air route is adequate for the safe operation of air services.   

### Article  III  

The airlines designated by each Contracting Party shall enjoy, while operating the specified air services, the rights: 

(i) to fly their aircraft across the territory of the other Contracting Party;  

(ii) to make stops in the said territory for non-traffic purposes; and  

(iii) subject to the provisions of Article IV to make stops in the said territory at the points specified in the Annex to this Agreement for the purposes of setting down and picking up international traffic in passengers, cargo and mail.    

### Article  IV  

1.  It is recognised that each Contracting Party shall have fair and equal rights to the carriage of 3rd and 4th freedom traffic on the routes specified in the Annex to this Agreement, 5th freedom traffic to have a supplementary character. Where traffic is of the nature of 5th freedom to one Contracting Party but 3rd or 4th freedom to the other Contracting Party, the primary right to the carriage of such traffic shall be that of the latter Contracting Party. The first Contracting Party shall have the right to uplift such 5th freedom traffic provided that it shall not be prejudicial to the primary interests of the other Contracting Party.   
2.  The capacity offered by the airlines of each Contracting Party on the specified air routes shall jointly bear a close relationship to the current and reasonable anticipated needs of the public for air transport at a reasonable load factor.   
3.  The right of the airlines of either Contracting Party to embark and to disembark at points in the territory of the other Contracting Party international traffic destined for or coming from third countries shall, subject to the principles in paragraph 1 of this Article, be related to: 

(a) The air transport needs between the country of origin and the countries of destination and the air transport needs of the area through which the airline passes, after taking into account the services operated by airlines of the other Contracting Party over the whole or parts of the route specified, and  

(b) the economics of through airline operation.     
4.  The capacity to be provided at the outset shall be agreed between both Contracting Parties before the agreed services are inaugurated. Thereafter, the capacity to be provided shall be discussed from time to time between the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties and any changes in capacity agreed upon shall be confirmed by an Exchange of Notes. Changes thus agreed upon will become effective not later than six months from the date of the Exchange of Notes.   

### Article  V  

(A).  The aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties shall exchange information as promptly as possible concerning the current authorisations extended to their respective designated airlines to render service to, through and from the territory of the other Contracting Party. This will include copies of current certificates and authorisations for service on the specified air routes, together with amendments, exemption orders and authorised service patterns.   
(B).  Each Contracting Party shall cause its designated airlines to provide to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party, as long in advance as practicable, copies of time tables, tariff schedules, including any modification thereof, and all other relevant information concerning the operation of the specified air services including information about the capacity provided on each of the specified air routes and any further information as may be required to satisfy the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party that the requirements of this Agreement are being duly observed.   
(C).  Each Contracting Party shall cause its designated airlines to provide to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party statistics relating to the traffic carried on their air services to, from or over the territory of the other Contracting Party showing the origin and destination of the traffic.   

### Article  VI  

(A).  Rates shall be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including costs of comparable economical operation, reasonable profit and differences of characteristics of service.   
(B).  The rates to be charged by the designated airlines of each Contracting Party in respect of traffic carried under this Agreement to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be agreed in the first instance between the designated airlines of both the Contracting Parties an shall have regard to relevant rates adopted by the International Air Transport Association. Any rates so agreed shall be subject to the approval of the aeronautical authorities of both the Contracting Parties. In the event of disagreement between the airlines and/or the aeronautical authorities, the Contracting Parties themselves shall endeavour to reach agreement and will take all necessary steps to give effect to such agreement. Should the Contracting Parties fail to agree, the dispute shall be dealt with in accordance with Article XI. Pending settlement of any such disagreement, the rates already established shall prevail.   

### Article  VII  

Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into or taken on board aircraft in the territory of one Contracting Party by, or on behalf of the other Contracting Party or its designated airlines and intended solely for use by the latter's aircraft shall be accorded, with respect to customs duty, inspection fees or other charges imposed by the former Contracting Party, treatment not less favourably than that granted to its national airlines engaged in international public transport or to the airlines of the most favoured nation.  

### Article  VIII  

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to itself to withhold or revoke, or impose such appropriate conditions as it may deem necessary with respect to an operating permission, in case it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of the airline are vested in the nationals of the other Contracting Party, or in case of failure by a designated airline of the other Contracting Party to comply with the laws and regulations of the former Contracting Party, or in case, in the judgment of the former Contracting Party, there is a failure to fulfil the conditions under which the rights are granted in accordance with this Agreement. Except in case of a failure to comply with laws and regulations, such action shall be taken only after consultation between the Contracting Parties. In the event of action by one Contracting Party under this Article, the rights of the other Contracting Party under Article XI shall not be prejudiced.  

### Article  IX  

(A).  In a spirit of close collaboration, the aeronautical authorities of the two Contracting Parties will consult regularly with a view to assuring the observance of the principles and the implementation of the provisions outlined in this Agreement.   
(B).  Either Contracting Party may at any time request consultation with the other with a view to initiating any amendments of the Agreement which it may deem desirable.

(C).  Changes made by either Contracting Party in the specified air routes, except those which change the points served by the designated airlines in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall not be considered as modifications of this Agreement. The aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party may, therefore, proceed unilaterally to make such changes, provided, however, that notice of any change shall be given without delay to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party. If such latter aeronautical authorities find that, having regard to the principles set forth in this Agreement, the interests of any of their airlines are prejudiced by the carriage by a designated airline of the first Contracting Party of traffic between the territory of the second Contracting Party, and the new point in the territory of a third country, the latter Party may request consultation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (B) of this Article.   

### Article  X  

Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall be simultaneously communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. This Agreement shall terminate one year after the date of receipt of the notice by the other Contracting Party, unless the notice is withdrawn by agreement before the expiration of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  

### Article  XI  

(A).  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation between themselves.   
(B).  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, 

(i) they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to an arbitral tribunal or some other person or body appointed by agreement between them; or  

(ii) If they do not so agree or if, having agreed to refer the dispute to an arbitral tribunal they cannot reach agreement as to its composition, either Contracting Party may submit the dispute for decision to any tribunal competent to decide it established within the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or, if there be no such tribunal, to the International Court of Justice.     
(C).  The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision given, including any interim recommendation made, under paragraph (B) of this Article.   
(D).  If and so long as either Contracting Party or a designated airline of either Contracting Party fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (C) of this Article, the other Contracting Party may limit, withhold or revoke any rights which it has granted by virtue of the present Agreement.   

### Article  XII  

To the extent to which they are applicable to the air services established under this Agreement, the provisions of the Convention, and in particular, Articles 9, 11, 13, 15, 24, 31, 32 and 33 thereof, shall remain in force in their present form between the Contracting Parties for the duration of the Agreement, as if they were an integral part of the Agreement, unless both Contracting Parties ratify any amendment to the provisions of the Convention which shall have come into force in accordance with Article 94 of the Convention, in which case these provisions as amended shall remain in force for the duration of this Agreement.  

### Article  XIII  

In the event of the conclusion of a multilateral convention or agreement concerning air transport to which both Contracting Parties adhere, this Agreement shall be modified to conform with the provisions of such convention or agreement.

####Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van Pakistan betreffende luchtdiensten

De Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van Pakistan, hierna te noemen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, Partij zijnde bij het Verdrag inzake de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart en de Overeenkomst inzake de Doortocht van Internationale Luchtdiensten, beide ondertekend te Chicago op de zevende dag van December 1944, waarvan de bepalingen bindend zijn voor beide Partijen, En wensende een overeenkomst te sluiten voor de exploitatie van luchtvervoersdiensten tussen en via haar onderscheidene grondgebieden,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  I  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verleent aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht de luchtdiensten, omschreven in de Bijlage van deze Overeenkomst (hierna te noemen de „omschreven luchtdiensten”) uit te oefenen op de routes, omschreven in bedoelde Bijlage (hierna te noemen de „omschreven luchtroutes”).  

### Artikel  II  

A).  Elk van de omschreven luchtdiensten kan onmiddellijk dan wel op een later tijdstip naar verkiezing van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, waaraan de rechten worden verleend, worden geopend, op voorwaarde, dat: 

1. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, waaraan de rechten zijn verleend, een luchtvaartmaatschappij (hierna te noemen een „aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij”) voor de omschreven luchtroutes zal hebben aangewezen;  

2. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke de rechten verleent, aan de luchtvaartmaatschappij de passende exploitatievergunning zal hebben verleend, hetgeen zij met de minst mogelijke vertraging zal doen, mits de luchtvaartmaatschappij, indien zulks van haar verlangd wordt, voldaan heeft aan de eisen van lid B) van dit Artikel.     
B).  Van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan worden verlangd, dat zij ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke de rechten verleent, aantoont, dat zij in staat is de voorwaarden na te komen, voorgeschreven bij of krachtens de wetten en voorschriften, welke gewoonlijk door die autoriteiten ten aanzien van de exploitatie van internationale luchtdiensten worden toegepast.   
C).  De exploitatie van elk van de omschreven luchtdiensten zal onderworpen zijn aan de accoord-bevinding van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, dat de route-organisatie, beschikbaar voor de burgerlijke luchtvaart op de omschreven luchtroute, voldoende is voor de veilige exploitatie van luchtdiensten.   

### Artikel  III  

De door elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen zullen bij de exploitatie van de omschreven luchtdiensten het recht genieten om 

i) met hun vliegtuigen over het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te vliegen,  

ii) te landen op dat grondgebied voor niet-verkeersdoeleinden, en  

iii) behoudens de bepalingen van Artikel IV op dat grondgebied op de in de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst omschreven punten te landen teneinde internationaal verkeer van passagiers, vracht en post af te zetten of op te nemen.    

### Artikel  IV  

1.  Erkend wordt dat elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij eerlijke en gelijke rechten zal hebben op het vervoer van 3e en 4e vrijheidsverkeer op de in de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst omschreven routes, terwijl 5e vrijheidsverkeer een aanvullend karakter zal hebben. Waar verkeer het karakter van 5e vrijheid heeft voor de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, maar dat van 3e of 4e vrijheid voor de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zal het primaire recht op het vervoer van dat verkeer berusten bij laatstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. De eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal het recht hebben dat 5e vrijheidsverkeer te bewerkstelligen mits dit de primaire belangen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij niet zal schaden.   
2.  De door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangeboden capaciteit op de omschreven luchtroutes zal gezamenlijk met inachtneming van een redelijke bezettingsgraad nauw verband houden met de bestaande en redelijkerwijze te verwachten behoeften van het publiek aan luchtvervoer.   
3.  Het recht van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen om op punten in het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij internationaal verkeer, bestemd voor of afkomstig van derde landen op te nemen en af te zetten, zal, behoudens de beginselen van paragraaf 1 van dit Artikel, verband houden met: 

a) De behoeften aan luchtvervoer tussen het land van herkomst en de landen van bestemming en de behoeften aan luchtvervoer van het gebied, waarover de luchtlijn voert, rekening houdende met de diensten, welke door luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij over het geheel of gedeelten van de omschreven route worden geëxploiteerd en  

b) de economische aspecten van de exploitatie van doorgaande lijnen.     
4.  Beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dienen over de bij de aanvang te verschaffen capaciteit overeenstemming te bereiken voordat met de overeengekomen diensten een aanvang wordt gemaakt. Daarna wordt de te verschaffen capaciteit telkenmale tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen besproken; alle overeengekomen wijzigingen van de capaciteit dienen te worden bevestigd door middel van een notawisseling. Aldus overeengekomen wijzigingen worden niet later dan zes maanden na de datum van de notawisseling van kracht.   

### Artikel  V  

A).  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen zo spoedig mogelijk gegevens uitwisselen betreffende de lopende vergunningen verleend aan haar onderscheidene aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen om diensten te verschaffen naar, via en van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Daaronder zullen worden gerekend afschriften van lopende certificaten en vergunningen voor het uitvoeren van diensten op de omschreven luchtroutes benevens wijzigingen, vrijstellingen en toegestane dienstschema's.   
B).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal bewerkstelligen, dat haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zo lang mogelijk van te voren zullen verschaffen afschriften van dienstregelingen, tarievenlijsten, met inbegrip van alle wijzigingen daarvan, en alle andere terzake dienende inlichtingen betreffende de exploitatie van de omschreven luchtdiensten, inlichtingen omtrent de op ieder van de omschreven luchtroutes te verschaffen capaciteit daaronder begrepen, benevens alle verdere inlichtingen, welke verlangd kunnen worden om ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan te tonen, dat de vereisten van deze Overeenkomst behoorlijk in acht worden genomen.   
C).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal bewerkstelligen, dat haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij statistieken verschaffen betreffende het verkeer, dat op haar luchtdiensten naar, van en over het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij werd vervoerd, waaruit de herkomst en bestemming van het verkeer blijken.   

### Artikel  VI  

A).  Tarieven zullen worden vastgesteld op redelijke hoogten, waarbij behoorlijk rekening zal worden gehouden met alle terzake dienende factoren, daarbij inbegrepen de kosten van vergelijkbare economische exploitatie, redelijke winst en verschillen in hoedanigheid van de dienst.   
B).  De door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te heffen tarieven ten aanzien van verkeer, dat op grond van deze Overeenkomst naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij wordt vervoerd, zullen in eerste aanleg worden overeengekomen tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en zullen verband houden met terzake dienende tarieven, welke zijn aangenomen door de Internationale Luchtvervoers Vereniging. Alle zodanig overeengekomen tarieven zullen onderworpen zijn aan de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. In geval van meningsverschil tussen de luchtvaartmaatschappijen en/of de luchtvaartautoriteiten zullen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zelf trachten tot overeenstemming te geraken en zullen zij alle nodige stappen ondernemen om zulk een overeenkomst ten uitvoer te brengen. Zouden de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen tot overeenstemming te komen, dan zal het geschilpunt worden behandeld overeenkomstig Artikel XI. Hangende de regeling van enig meningsverschil zullen de reeds vastgestelde tarieven blijven gelden.   

### Artikel  VII  

Ten aanzien van motorbrandstof, smeeroliën en reservedelen, ingevoerd in of aan boord genomen van luchtvaartuigen op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij door of namens de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen en uitsluitend bestemd om te worden gebruikt door de luchtvaartuigen van laatstgenoemde, wordt, voor wat betreft douanerechten, inspectiekosten of andere rechten, geheven door de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, een behandeling toegepast, welke niet ongunstiger is dan die, toegestaan aan haar nationale luchtvaartmaatschappijen, welke zich bezighouden met internationaal openbaar vervoer of aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de meest begunstigde natie.  

### Artikel  VIII  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor een exploitatievergunning niet te verlenen of in te trekken of zodanige passende voorwaarden te stellen als zij met betrekking daarop noodzakelijk kan achten, ingeval niet tot haar genoegen is gebleken, dat het overwegende eigendomsrecht en de daadwerkelijke leiding van de luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij onderdanen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of ingeval een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in gebreke blijft zich te houden aan de wetten en voorschriften van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of in geval, naar het oordeel van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, de voorwaarden, waaronder de rechten overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst worden verleend, niet worden nagekomen. Behoudens in geval van niet naleving van de wetten en voorschriften zullen zodanige maatregelen slechts genomen worden na overleg tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. In geval van maatregelen door een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op grond van dit Artikel, zullen de rechten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op grond van Artikel XI onverlet blijven.  

### Artikel  IX  

A).  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking zullen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen geregeld overleg plegen, teneinde het inachtnemen van de beginselen en de toepassing van de bepalingen, uiteengezet in deze Overeenkomst, te verzekeren.   
B).  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan op elk willekeurig tijdstip overleg met de andere verzoeken, teneinde te komen tot wijzigingen van de Overeenkomst, welke zij wenselijk acht. Zulk overleg zal aanvangen binnen een periode van 60 dagen, te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek. Enige wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, welke als resultaat van zulk een overleg wordt overeengekomen, zal van kracht worden, wanneer zij is bevestigd door uitwisseling van diplomatieke nota's.   
C).  Wijzigingen, door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangebracht in de omschreven luchtroutes, behoudens die, welke verandering brengen in de punten, bediend door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen binnen het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zullen niet worden beschouwd als wijzigingen van deze Overeenkomst. De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen derhalve eenzijdig tot zulke wijzigingen overgaan, mits echter onverwijld mededeling van iedere verandering aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal worden gedaan. Indien die laatstgenoemde luchtvaartautoriteiten van mening zijn, dat met het oog op de beginselen, vervat in deze Overeenkomst, de belangen van haar luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden benadeeld door het vervoer door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de eerste Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van verkeer tussen het grondgebied van de tweede Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en het nieuwe punt in het grondgebied van een derde land, kan laatstgenoemde Partij overleg verzoeken overeenkomstig de voorwaarden van lid B) van dit Artikel.   

### Artikel  X

Bij ontbreken van ontvangstbevestiging van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal de mededeling geacht worden te zijn ontvangen veertien dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie.  

### Artikel  XI  

A).  Indien enig geschil ontstaat tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, zullen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats trachten het op te lossen door onderlinge onderhandelingen.   
B).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen geen oplossing kunnen bereiken door onderhandelingen, 

i) kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing te verwijzen naar een scheidsgerecht of naar een ander in onderling overleg door hen aangewezen persoon of lichaam; of  

ii) indien zij hieromtrent niet tot overeenstemming komen of indien zij, na overeengekomen te zijn het geschil naar een scheidsgerecht te verwijzen, niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de samenstelling daarvan, kan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan een tot beslissing bevoegde rechtbank, welke binnen de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie is opgericht, of, indien zulk een rechtbank niet bestaat, aan het Internationale Gerechtshof.     
C).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nemen op zich, zich te houden aan enige ingevolge lid B) van dit Artikel gegeven beslissing, voorlopig gegeven adviezen daaronder begrepen.   
D).
