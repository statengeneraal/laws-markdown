2.

4.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht te weigeren de exploitatievergunning als bedoeld in lid 2 van dit artikel te verlenen, of de door haar noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden te verbinden aan de uitoefening door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de rechten als bedoeld in artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst, in elk geval waarin niet ten genoegen van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij aanwijst, of bij haar onderdanen.

3.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd tenminste dertig (30) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering; in bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, behoudens toestemming van de genoemde autoriteiten.
