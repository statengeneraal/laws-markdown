3.  Na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunning kan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij te allen tijde een aanvang maken met de gehele of gedeeltelijke exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten, mits zij aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst voldoet en de tarieven voor deze diensten zijn vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 6 van deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunning te weigeren of deze vergunning te verlenen onder noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden ter zake van de uitoefening van de in artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, indien niet te haren genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het daadwerkelijke toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen en/of bij haar onderdanen.   

### Artikel  5  

####Intrekking en opschorting van vergunningen

1.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij hebben het recht de in artikel 4 bedoelde vergunningen voor een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij niet te verlenen, deze in te trekken of op te schorten, of hieraan voorwaarden te verbinden: 

a. in het geval een zodanige luchtvaartmaatschappij nalaat ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan te tonen dat zij voldoet aan de door die autoriteiten gewoonlijk en redelijkerwijze in overeenstemming met het Verdrag toegepaste wetten en voorschriften;  

b. in het geval een zodanige luchtvaartmaatschappij in gebreke blijft de wetten en voorschriften van die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij na te leven;  

c. in het geval niet te hunnen genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op de luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen of bij haar onderdanen; en  

d. in het geval de luchtvaartmaatschappij anderszins nalaat de exploitatie te voeren in overeenstemming met de ingevolge deze Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden.     
2.  Tenzij onmiddellijk ingrijpen van wezenlijk belang is ter voorkoming van verdere inbreuken op de hierboven bedoelde wetten en voorschriften, worden de in het eerste lid van dit artikel opgesomde rechten alleen uitgeoefend na overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Tenzij anders door Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, vangt zulk overleg aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen vanaf de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek.   

### Artikel  6  

####Tarieven

1.  De door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in rekening te brengen tarieven voor vervoer tussen hun grondgebieden dienen de tarieven te zijn die zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, en dienen te worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle relevante factoren, waaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van de andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de omschreven route.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, waar mogelijk, overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen door middel van toepassing van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging („International Air Transport Association") voor de vaststelling van tarieven. Wanneer zulks niet mogelijk is, worden de tarieven overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen. In elk geval is voor de tarieven de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vereist.   
3.  Alle aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden ten minste vijfenveertig (45) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, tenzij de bedoelde autoriteiten overeenkomen deze termijn in bijzondere gevallen te bekorten.   
4.  De tarieven kunnen uitdrukkelijk worden goedgekeurd of worden, indien geen van beide luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig (30) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering, overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, te kennen heeft gegeven de tarieven niet goed te keuren, geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Ingeval de termijn van voorlegging wordt bekort, zoals voorzien in het derde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de termijn waarbinnen kennisgeving van afkeuring moet geschieden, dienovereenkomstig wordt bekort.   
5.  Indien een tarief niet kan worden overeengekomen overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien gedurende de overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel van toepassing zijnde termijn de ene luchtvaartautoriteit de andere luchtvaartautoriteit te kennen geeft dat zij een overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief niet goedkeurt, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken omtrent een overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief, of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 18 van deze Overeenkomst.   
7.  Tarieven die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn vastgesteld, blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven in rekening brengen die verschillen van die welke in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn goedgekeurd.

####Bijlage bij de Overeenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Estland inzake luchtdiensten tussen en via hun onderscheiden grondgebieden

### 1  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden heeft het recht luchtdiensten te exploiteren op de hieronder aangegeven routes: punten in Nederland - tussenliggende punten - punten in Estland - verder gelegen punten, in beide richtingen.  

### 2  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de Republiek Estland heeft het recht luchtdiensten te exploiteren op de hieronder aangegeven routes: punten in Estland - tussenliggende punten - punten in Nederland - verder gelegen punten, in beide richtingen.  

### 3  

Elk punt of alle punten op de omschreven routes kan of kunnen, naar keuze van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, op een vlucht of op alle vluchten worden overgeslagen.  

### 4  

Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toegestaan vluchten te exploiteren op de hierboven omschreven routes, zonder beperkingen ten aanzien van frequentie en type luchtvaartuig, in alle klassen.  

### 5  

Elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft het recht volledige vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uit te oefenen op alle tussenliggende en verder gelegen punten in haar onderscheiden routetabel. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft evenwel niet het recht vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uit te oefenen op verder gelegen gedeelten waarop een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij derde- en vierde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uitoefent, tenzij 

a. de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen anders overeenkomen, of  

b. de betrokken luchtvaartmaatschappijen een passende commerciële overeenkomst sluiten.   Ingeval de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uitoefent op een gedeelte waarop een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij derde- en vierde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten begint uit te oefenen in de loop van een IATA-seizoen, mag de eerstbedoelde aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij haar uitoefening van vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten voortzetten tot het einde van dat IATA-seizoen.
