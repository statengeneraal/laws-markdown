### Artikel  7  

####Tarieven

7.1.  De tarieven die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden geheven voor het vervoer naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden op een redelijk niveau vastgesteld, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de aangewezen routes.   
7.2.  De in paragraaf 7.1 van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, vastgesteld in overeenstemming tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen; deze overeenstemming dient, indien mogelijk, te worden bereikt met gebruikmaking van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging voor de opstelling van tarieven.   
7.3.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd ten minste zestig (60) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering. Deze periode kan, wanneer de genoemde autoriteiten aldus overeenkomen, in bijzondere gevallen worden verkort, maar zij mag niet minder bedragen dan dertig (30) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering.   
7.4.

In het geval dat de periode, als voorzien in paragraaf 7.3 van dit artikel, is verkort, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de periode waarbinnen kennis moet worden gegeven dat de tarieven niet worden goedgekeurd, vijftien (15) dagen bedraagt.   
7.5.  Wanneer geen overeenstemming kan worden bereikt overeenkomstig paragraaf 7.2 van dit artikel, of wanneer een luchtvaartautoriteit gedurende de volgens paragraaf 7.4 van dit artikel geldende termijn aan de andere luchtvaartautoriteit kennis geeft niet in te stemmen met een tarief dat overeenkomstig het in paragraaf 7.2 van dit artikel bepaalde is overeengekomen, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, na overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van andere Staten wier advies zij nuttig achten, het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
7.6.  Wanneer de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over de goedkeuring van een tarief dat hun krachtens paragraaf 7.3 van dit artikel is voorgelegd, of over de vaststelling van een tarief overeenkomstig paragraaf 7.5 van dit artikel, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig het in artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst bepaalde.   
7.7.  Tarieven die overeenkomstig het in dit artikel bepaalde zijn vastgesteld, blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
7.8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven heffen die afwijken van degene die in overeenstemming met het in dit artikel bepaalde zijn goedgekeurd.
