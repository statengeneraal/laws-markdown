####Tarieven

1.  De tarieven die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden berekend voor het vervoer tussen hun grondgebieden, zijn die welke zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en zij worden vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle relevante factoren, waaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de omschreven route.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen door middel van toepassing van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging („International Air Transport Association") voor de vaststelling van tarieven. Wanneer zulks niet mogelijk is, worden de tarieven overeengekomen door de aangewezen, luchtvaartmaatschappijen. In elk geval is voor de tarieven goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vereist.   
3.  Alle aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden ten minste zestig (60) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, behalve wanneer genoemde autoriteiten overeenkomen deze termijn in bijzondere gevallen te verkorten.   
4.  De tarieven kunnen uitdrukkelijk worden goedgekeurd of worden, indien geen van beide luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig (30) dagen na de datum van voorlegging overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel te kennen heeft gegeven de tarieven niet goed te keuren, geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Indien de termijn voor de voorlegging van tarieven wordt verkort, zoals bepaald in het derde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de termijn waarbinnen van het niet goedkeuren kennis dient te worden gegeven dienovereenkomstig wordt verkort.   
5.  Indien een tarief niet kan worden overeengekomen overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien gedurende de overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel geldende termijn de ene luchtvaartautoriteit de andere luchtvaartautoriteit te kennen geeft dat zij een overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief niet goedkeurt, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken omtrent een overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief, of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 16 van deze Overeenkomst.   
7.  Overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven berekenen die afwijken van die welke in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn goedgekeurd.
