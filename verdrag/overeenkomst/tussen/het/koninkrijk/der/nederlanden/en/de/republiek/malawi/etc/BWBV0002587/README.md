### Artikel  VI  

####De beginselen waaraan de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten moeten voldoen

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden op billijke en gelijke wijze in de gelegenheid gesteld de omschreven luchtroutes tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden te exploiteren.   
2.  Het door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verrichte luchtvervoer heeft als hoofddoel de verschaffing bij een redelijk beladingsniveau van een capaciteit die toereikend is om te voldoen aan de huidige en de redelijkerwijze te verwachten vraag naar vervoer tussen het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappijen heeft aangewezen en de landen van eindbestemming van dit vervoer.   
3.  Bij de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt de gecombineerde capaciteit die wordt verschaft door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op redelijke wijze afgestemd op de behoeften van het publiek aan luchtvervoer.   

### Artikel  VII  

####Indiening van dienstregelingen

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen legt uiterlijk 30 dagen voor de datum van de exploitatie van een overeengekomen luchtdienst haar voorgestelde dienstregelingen voor aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Deze dienstregelingen dienen onder meer aan te geven het soort luchtdienst, het soort te gebruiken luchtvaartuig(en), de vluchtschema's en, waar van toepassing, de tarieven.   
2.  Indien een der beide luchtvaartmaatschappijen aanvullende of extra vluchten wenst te exploiteren naast die welke zijn aangegeven in de goedgekeurde dienstregelingen, dient zij eerst de toestemming te verkrijgen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de desbetreffende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  VIII  

####Tarieven

1.  De door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toe te passen tarieven voor het vervoer tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden zijn die welke door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn goedgekeurd en worden op een redelijk niveau vastgesteld, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de omschreven route.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Alle tarieven worden ten minste zestig (60) dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van invoering aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd, behalve indien de genoemde autoriteiten overeenkomen deze termijnen in bijzondere gevallen te verkorten.   
4.  Goedkeuring van de tarieven kan uitdrukkelijk geschieden; indien geen der luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig (30) dagen vanaf de datum van voorlegging overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel te kennen heeft gegeven de tarieven niet goed te keuren, worden de tarieven geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Indien het tijdvak van voorlegging wordt verkort, zoals bepaald in het derde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat het tijdvak waarbinnen van het niet goedkeuren van de tarieven kennis dient te worden gegeven, op overeenkomstige wijze wordt verkort.   
5.  Indien gedurende het tijdvak dat overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel van toepassing is, de ene luchtvaartautoriteit aan de andere mededeling doet dat zij een overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel ingediend tarief niet kan goedkeuren, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, na raadpleging van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van elke andere Staat wier zienswijze zij nuttig achten, het tarief door middel van wederzijdse overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over de vaststelling van een tarief overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel XIX van deze Overeenkomst.   
7.  De overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen der beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen heffen geen tarieven die afwijken van die welke overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel zijn goedgekeurd.   

### Artikel  IX  

####Vrijstelling van belastingen, douanerechten en heffingen

1.  Luchtvaartuigen die door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op internationale luchtdiensten worden gebruikt, alsmede hun uitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, voorraden motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen, en boordproviand (met inbegrip van etenswaren, dranken en tabaksartikelen) die zich aan boord van die luchtvaartuigen bevinden, zijn bij binnenkomst op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, inspectiekosten en andere heffingen of belastingen, mits die uitrustingsstukken, onderdelen en voorraden aan boord van het luchtvaartuig blijven totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd of worden gebruikt op dat deel van de vlucht dat boven dat grondgebied wordt uitgevoerd.   
2.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het derde lid van dit artikel, zijn eveneens vrijgesteld van douanerechten, inspectiekosten en soortgelijke heffingen, met uitzondering van bijkomende betalingen voor verrichte diensten: 

a) boordproviand, ingeladen op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor gebruik aan boord van luchtvaartuigen op uitreis die worden gebruikt op een overeengekomen luchtdienst door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

b) reservedelen, ingevoerd op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor onderhoud of herstel van luchtvaartuigen gebruikt op de overeengekomen luchtdiensten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

c) brandstof en smeermiddelen te leveren aan luchtvaartuigen op uitreis, die worden geëxploiteerd op overeengekomen luchtdiensten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeen- komstsluitende Partij, zelfs wanneer deze voorraden gebruikt zullen worden op dat deel van de vlucht dat wordt uitgevoerd boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord worden genomen;  

d) uitrustingsstukken die tijdelijk op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden ingevoerd.     
3.  Van de in het tweede lid, letters (a), (b), (c) en (d) van dit artikel bedoelde materialen en voorraden kan worden verlangd dat deze onder douanetoezicht en -beheer blijven.   
4.  Dit artikel kan niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan worden verplicht douanerechten terug te betalen die reeds op de bovenbedoelde materialen zijn geheven.   

### Artikel  X  

####Het uitladen van uitrustingsstukken

De normale boorduitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, proviand en voorraden motorbrandstof en smeermiddelen die zich gewoonlijk aan boord bevinden van de luchtvaartuigen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, kunnen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van die Partij, die kunnen verlangen dat deze goederen onder hun toezicht worden geplaatst tot het tijdstip waarop zij weer worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.  

### Artikel  XI  

####Voorkoming van dubbele belasting

1.  Inkomsten en winsten verkregen uit de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van belastingen naar het inkomen en op winsten van welke vorm dan ook, ongeacht de wijze waarop zij worden geheven. Deze bepaling geldt ook voor inkomen en winsten verkregen uit deelneming in een samenwerkingsverband van luchtvaartmaatschappijen („airline pool"), een gemeenschappelijke onderneming („joint venture") of een internationale exploitatie-instelling („international-operating agency").   
2.  Luchtvaartuigen die worden geëxploiteerd op de overeengekomen diensten door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en roerende goederen die behoren bij de exploitatie van zodanige luchtvaartuigen zijn op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van belastingen naar het vermogen van welke vorm dan ook, ongeacht de wijze waarop zij worden geheven.   

### Artikel  XII  

####Toepassing van wetten, voorschriften en procedures

1.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen betreffende de toelating tot, of het verlaten van haar grondgebied van in internationale luchtdiensten gebruikte luchtvaartuigen of betreffende de exploitatie van en het vliegen met zulke luchtvaartuigen dienen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te worden nageleefd bij het binnenkomen in en tot en met het verlaten van genoemd grondgebied.   
2.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij betreffende toelating tot, verblijf in of het verlaten van haar grondgebied van passagiers, bemanning of vracht, met inbegrip van post, zoals wetten betreffende binnenkomst, uitreis, emigratie, immigratie en paspoorten, alsmede voorschriften inzake douane en de volksgezondheid, of sanitaire voorschriften, zijn van toepassing op passagiers, bemanning en vracht, met inbegrip van post, vervoerd door luchtvaartuigen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bij het binnenkomen in, of verlaten van een gedurende het verblijf binnen het grondgebied van genoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
3.  De kosten en heffingen die op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de vluchten van de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden berekend voor het gebruik van luchthavens en andere luchtvaartvoorzieningen op het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Partij, mogen niet hoger zijn dan die welke op het grondgebied van die eerstgenoemde Partij in rekening worden gebracht met betrekking tot soortgelijke vluchten van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
4.  Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mag andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen begunstigen ten opzichte van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bij de toepassing van haar voorschriften inzake douane, immigratie, quarantaine en soortgelijke voorschriften of bij het gebruik van luchthavens, luchtwegen en luchtverkeersdiensten en aanverwante voorzieningen waarop zij toezicht uitoefent.   

### Artikel  XIII  

####Veiligheid van de luchtvaart

De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen elkaar zoveel mogelijk bijstand te verlenen ten einde het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen of andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens en voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart, alsmede elke bedreiging van de veiligheid van de luchtvaart, te voorkomen. Zij nemen de bepalingen inzake de veiligheid zoals vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie in acht. Wanneer zich gevallen van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen of andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens of voorzieningen voor de luchtvaart voordoen of deze dreigen zich voor te doen, verlenen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkaar bijstand door vergemakkelijking van het doorgeven van maatregelen die ten doel hebben aan bedoelde voorvallen of bedreigingen op snelle en veilige wijze een einde te maken.  

### Artikel  XIV  

####Erkenning van bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en van vergunningen

Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en bevoegdverklaringen die zijn uitgereikt of geldig verklaard door de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en die nog van kracht zijn, worden door de andere Partij als geldig erkend voor de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes, mits zodanige bewijzen of vergunningen werden uitgereikt of geldig verklaard ingevolge en overeenkomstig de op grond van het Verdrag vastgestelde normen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor, de erkenning van bewijzen van bevoegdheid en van vergunningen die door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan haar eigen onderdanen zijn uitgereikt te weigeren voor vluchten boven haar eigen grondgebied.  

### Artikel  XV  

####Overmaking van ontvangsten

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn vrij uit het grondgebied van verkoop naar het grondgebied waar hun zetel is gevestigd, het batig saldo over te maken van de ontvangsten en uitgaven in het grondgebied van verkoop. In deze netto-overmaking zijn begrepen inkomsten uit verkopen, rechtstreeks of via een agent, van luchtvervoersdiensten en van bijkomende of aanvullende diensten, en de gebruikelijke commerciële rente op deze inkomsten verkregen, terwijl zij op een depositorekening stonden in afwachting van de overmaking.

### Artikel  XVII  

####Overleg en wijziging

1.  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd met elkaar overleg ten einde de uitvoering en bevredigende naleving van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te verzekeren; zij plegen eveneens, indien noodzakelijk, overleg omtrent wijziging daarvan.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan om overleg vragen, dat een aanvang moet nemen binnen zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek, tenzij beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen instemmen met verlenging van dit tijdvak. Het overleg kan zowel mondeling als schriftelijk plaats hebben.   
3.  Wijzigingen of veranderingen van deze Overeenkomst, overeengekomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, treden in werking op een in een diplomatieke notawisseling te bepalen datum.

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Verschaffing van gegevens

De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschaffen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, op verzoek van laatstgenoemde, gegevens betreffende het vervoer dat wordt verricht op de door de onderscheiden aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen geëxploiteerde overeengekomen diensten. Deze gegevens dienen tevens statistische gegevens en alle andere gegevens te omvatten die nodig zijn om de omvang van het vervoer te bepalen, verricht door deze luchtvaartmaatschappijen op de overeengekomen diensten, alsmede de herkomst en bestemming van dat vervoer.  

### Artikel  XIX  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil ontstaat omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen. Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen, wordt het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aan arbitrage onderworpen overeenkomstig de hieronder aangegeven procedures.   
2.  Arbitrage geschiedt door een scheidsgerecht, dat uit drie scheidsmannen bestaat en dat als volgt wordt samengesteld: 

(a) binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van een langs diplomatieke weg gedaan verzoek om arbitrage, wijst elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij één scheidsman aan. Binnen 60 dagen nadat deze beide scheidsmannen zijn aangewezen, benoemen zij in onderling overleg een derde scheidsman, die onderdaan is van een derde Staat en die als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht zal optreden;  

(b) indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in gebreke blijft een scheidsman aan te wijzen of indien de derde scheidsman niet wordt benoemd overeenkomstig letter (a) van dit lid, kan elk der Partijen de president van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie verzoeken binnen 30 dagen de vereiste scheidsman of scheidsmannen te benoemen. In dit geval dient de derde scheidsman onderdaan te zijn van een derde Staat en als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht op te treden.     
3.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, stelt het scheidsgerecht de grenzen van zijn rechtsmacht vast overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst en stelt het zijn eigen procedureregels vast. Op last van het scheidsgerecht of op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komt het scheidsgerecht ten hoogste 15 dagen nadat het is samengesteld bijeen om de aangelegenheden die het onderwerp van de arbitrage zullen vormen, alsmede de te volgen procedures, nader vast te stellen.   
4.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, dient elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een memorandum in binnen 45 dagen vanaf de datum waarop het scheidsgerecht volledig is samengesteld. De antwoorden dienen binnen 60 dagen te worden gegeven. Het scheidsgerecht houdt een hoorzitting op verzoek van een der Partijen of naar eigen goeddunken binnen 15 dagen nadat de antwoorden ontvangen moeten zijn.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet schriftelijk uitspraak binnen 30 dagen na beëindiging van de hoorzitting of, indien er geen hoorzitting plaatsvindt, 30 dagen na de datum waarop beide antwoorden zijn ingediend, naar gelang welke datum het eerst valt. De uitspraak van de meerderheid van het scheidsgerecht is doorslaggevend.   
6.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kunnen een verzoek om toelichting van de uitspraak indienen binnen 15 dagen nadat deze is gedaan; zulk een toelichting wordt binnen 15 dagen na het desbetreffende verzoek gegeven.   
7.  Het scheidsgerecht is in alle voorkomende gevallen en te allen tijde bevoegd, hetzij uit eigen beweging, hetzij op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, voorlopige maatregelen te gelasten ten einde de rechten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen veilig te stellen. Een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan zulk een verzoek doen in haar schriftelijk betoog, tijdens de hoorzitting, dan wel daarna.   
8.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voert elke beslissing of uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht volledig uit.   
9.  De kosten van het scheidsgerecht, daaronder begrepen de honoraria en kosten van de scheidsmannen, worden gelijkelijk door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gedragen, tenzij het scheidsgerecht anders beslist.

### Artikel  XXI  

####Beëindiging

Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan te allen tijde de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij langs diplomatieke weg schriftelijk mededeling doen van haar besluit deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In dit geval eindigt de Overeenkomst twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling van opzegging in onderling overleg voor het einde van dit tijdvak wordt ingetrokken. Indien de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij nalaat de ontvangst te bevestigen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.  

### Artikel  XXII  

####Het treden in de plaats van internationale overeenkomsten

Deze Overeenkomst treedt in de plaats van alle voorgaande bilaterale regelingen die tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van kracht zijn aangaande tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden geëxploiteerde luchtdiensten.
