3.  The Contracting Parties shall act in conformity with any agreement effective between them regarding the suppression of acts of unlawful interference, inter alia in respect of aircraft in flight, aircraft in service and/or security at airports.   
4.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and designated as Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties.

Should a Contracting Party depart from the aviation security provisions of this Article, the aeronautical authority of the other Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the aeronautical authority of that Party in conformity with Article 17 of this Agreement. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within sixty (60) days may constitute grounds for the application of Article 18 of this Agreement.   

### Article  16 bis  

####Aviation safety

1.  A Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other Contracting Party relating to aeronautical facilities, aircrew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of such request.   
2.  If, following such consultations, a Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to above which are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards. Such Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action and failure to take appropriate action within fifteen (15) days of being notified thereof, or such longer period as may be agreed upon, shall be grounds for the application of Article 5.   
3.  Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in Article 33 of the Convention, it is agreed that any aircraft operated by the designated airline of one Contracting Party on services to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party, may, while within the territory of the other Contracting Party, be subject to an examination by the authorised representative of that Contracting Party. The purpose of such examination shall include the verification of the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the aircraft and its equipment (hereinafter referred as “ramp inspection”), provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.   
4.  If any such ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections gives rise to serious concerns that: 

a) an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention; or  

b) there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention,   the Contracting Party carrying out the ramp inspection shall, for the purposes of Article 33 of the Convention, be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificate or licences in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that aircraft had been issued or rendered valid, or that the requirements under which that aircraft is operated, are not equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention.   
5.  In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the designated airline of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3 above is denied by the representatives of that designated airline, the other Contracting Party may infer that serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 4 above arise and draw conclusions referred to in that paragraph.   
6.  Each Contracting Party reserves the right to immediately suspend or vary the operating authorization of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party in the event the first Contracting Party concludes, whether as a result of a ramp inspection or consultation, that immediate action is essential to the safety of airline operation.   
7.  Any action by one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 6 above, shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Contracting Party with the safety provisions of this Article.   

### Article  17  

####Consultation and Amendment

1.  In a spirit of close cooperation the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall consult each other from time to time with a view to ensuring the implementation of, and satisfactory compliance with, the provisions of this Agreement and shall consult when necessary to provide for modification thereof.   
2.  Either Contracting Party may request consultations, which shall begin within sixty (60) days of the date of the receipt of the request unless both Contracting Parties agree to an extension of reduction of this period. Such consultations may be conducted either orally or in writing.   
3.  Any amendment or modification of this Agreement agreed to by the Contracting Parties, shall come into effect on a date to be determined in an exchange of diplomatic notes and be dependent upon the completion of nationally required legal procedures.   
4.  Any amendment or modification of the Annex to this Agreement shall be agreed upon in writing between the aeronautical authorities and shall take effect on a date to be determined by the aeronautical authorities.   

### Article  18  

####Settlement of Disputes

1.  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation between themselves.   
2.  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, the dispute may at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators (hereinafter referred to as the "Tribunal"), one to be appointed by each Contracting Party and the third to be agreed upon by the two arbitrators so appointed, provided that such third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party. Each of the Contracting Parties shall designate its arbitrator within a period of sixty days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other Contracting Party of a diplomatic note requesting arbitration of the dispute and the third arbitrator shall be agreed upon within a further period of sixty days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to designate its own arbitrator within the period of sixty days or if the third arbitrator is not agreed upon within the period indicated, the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation may be requested by either Contracting Party to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators.   
3.  The Tribunal shall determine its own procedure.   
4.  Subject to the final decision of the Tribunal, the Contracting Parties shall bear in equal proportion the initial costs of arbitration.   
5.  The Contracting Parties shall comply with any provisional ruling and the final decision of the Tribunal.

### Article  19  

####Termination of Agreement

Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement.

In bijzondere gevallen kan deze aankondigingstermijn worden bekort, behoudens de goedkeuring van de bedoelde autoriteiten.   
4.  De tarieven worden geacht te zijn goedgekeurd tenzij beide luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig (30) dagen na de datum van indiening overeenkomstig het derde lid kennisgeving van afkeuring van de tarieven hebben gedaan. In het geval van bekorting van de aankondigingstermijn als voorzien in het derde lid, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de termijn waarbinnen kennisgeving van afkeuring moet geschieden, korter is dan dertig (30) dagen.   
5.  Tarieven die in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn vastgesteld, blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
6.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven in rekening brengen die verschillen van die welke zijn goedgekeurd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  9

1.  Een door elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij legt 60 dagen tevoren de dienstregeling van haar voorgenomen diensten ter goedkeuring voor aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, en vermeldt daarbij de frequentie, het type luchtvaartuig, de klasse-indeling en het aantal voor het publiek beschikbare zitplaatsen.   
2.  Indien een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij aanvullende of extra vluchten wenst uit te voeren naast die vermeld in de goedgekeurde dienstregelingen, dient zij eerst de toestemming van de luchtvaartautoriteit van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te verkrijgen.   
3.  Latere wijzigingen in de goedgekeurde dienstregelingen van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij dienen ter goedkeuring te worden voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteit van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  10  

####Verschaffing van informatie

De luchtvaartautoriteit van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschaft de luchtvaartautoriteit van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op verzoek van laatstgenoemde informatie betreffende het op de overeengekomen diensten door de onderscheiden aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de eerstgenoemde verrichte vervoer. Deze informatie omvat statistieken en alle andere gegevens die nodig zijn ter bepaling van de omvang van het door deze luchtvaartmaatschappijen op de overeengekomen diensten verrichte vervoer.

####Beveiliging van de luchtvaart

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bevestigen opnieuw dat hun verplichting, in hun onderlinge betrekkingen, tot bescherming van de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart tegen daden van wederrechtelijke inmenging een integrerend deel van deze Overeenkomst uitmaakt.   
2.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlenen elkander op verzoek alle nodige bijstand ter voorkoming van handelingen tot het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen en andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van de passagiers, bemanning, luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens en luchtvaartvoorzieningen, alsmede van elke andere bedreiging voor de veiligheid van de luchtvaart.

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil ontstaat met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dit in de eerste plaats te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen tot een regeling te komen door middel van onderhandelingen, kan het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan een gerecht van drie scheidsmannen (hierna te noemen „het scheidsgerecht"), waarvan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij er een benoemt, terwijl omtrent de derde overeenstemming wordt bereikt door de twee aldus benoemde scheidsmannen, met dien verstande dat deze derde scheidsman geen onderdaan is van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wijst haar scheidsman aan binnen een termijn van zestig dagen vanaf de datum van ontvangst door de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van een diplomatieke nota van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waarin om een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing wordt verzocht en over de derde scheidsman wordt binnen een volgende termijn van zestig dagen overeenstemming bereikt. Indien een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen niet binnen de termijn van zestig dagen haar scheidsman aanwijst of indien niet binnen de aangegeven termijn overeenstemming omtrent de derde scheidsman wordt bereikt, kan door een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de Voorzitter van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaart worden verzocht een scheidsman of scheidsmannen te benoemen.   
3.  Het scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
4.  In afwachting van de definitieve uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht dragen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gelijkelijk de eerste kosten van de arbitrage.   
5.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen houden zich aan een voorlopige beslissing en de definitieve uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht.   
6.  Indien en zolang een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zich niet houdt aan een op grond van dit artikel gedane uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij elk recht of voorrecht beperken, intrekken of herroepen dat zij op grond van deze Overeenkomst aan de in gebreke blijvende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft verleend.   

### Artikel  19  

####Beëindiging van de Overeenkomst

Elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan te allen tijde de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in kennis stellen van haar voornemen deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Deze kennisgeving wordt tegelijkertijd toegezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In een dergelijk geval wordt de Overeenkomst beëindigd twaalf (12) maanden na de datum waarop de kennisgeving door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij werd ontvangen, tenzij de kennisgeving van beëindiging in onderlinge overeenstemming wordt ingetrokken voor het verstrijken van de termijn. Indien de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de ontvangst niet bevestigt, wordt de kennisgeving geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na de ontvangst van de kennisgeving door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
