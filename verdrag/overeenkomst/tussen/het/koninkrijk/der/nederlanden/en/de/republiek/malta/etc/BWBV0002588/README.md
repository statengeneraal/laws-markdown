(6).  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) and (5) of this Article, no tariff shall come into force if the aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party have not approved it.

Included in such net transfer shall be revenues from sales, made directly or through an agent, of air transport services, and auxiliary or supplementary services, and normal commercial interest earned on such revenues while on deposit awaiting transfer.   
(2).  Such transfers will be approved with a minimum of administrative delay and shall be effected within a reasonable time from the date of lodgement of the relative application and will be treated in the same manner as the generality of imports of the Contracting Party.   

### Article  13  

(1).

Kosten en heffingen die op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de vluchten van de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden geheven voor het gebruik van luchthavens en andere luchtvaartvoorzieningen in het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Partij, mogen niet hoger zijn dan die welke in het grondgebied van die eerstgenoemde Partij in rekening worden gebracht met betrekking tot de vluchten van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die soortgelijke internationale luchtdiensten uitvoeren.   
(5).  Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mag een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij begunstigen ten opzichte van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bij de toepassing van haar voorschriften inzake douane, immigratie, quarantaine en soortgelijke aangelegenheden; of bij het gebruik van luchthavens, luchtwegen en luchtverkeersdiensten en aanverwante voorzieningen waarop zij toezicht uitoefent.   

### Artikel  7  

Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen die door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn uitgereikt of geldig verklaard en die nog van kracht zijn, worden door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij als geldig erkend voor de exploitatie van de overeengekomen luchtdiensten op de omschreven routes, mits deze bewijzen of vergunningen werden uitgereikt of geldig verklaard overeenkomstig de op grond van het Verdrag gestelde normen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor, te weigeren voor vluchten boven haar eigen grondgebied de bewijzen van bevoegdheid en de vergunningen te erkennen van haar eigen onderdanen, die hun zijn uitgereikt door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.  

### Artikel  8  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen: 

(a) op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kantoren vestigen ten behoeve van de bevordering van vervoer door de lucht en de verkoop van vliegbiljetten, alsook andere voor het verzorgen van luchtvervoer vereiste voorzieningen;  

(b) - in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ter zake van binnenkomst, verblijf en tewerkstelling - naar het grondgebied van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij leidinggevend -, commercieel -, technisch -, operationeel - en anderszins gespecialiseerd personeel, benodigd voor het verzorgen van luchtvervoer, uitzenden en daar doen verblijven; en  

(c) op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij rechtstreeks en naar goeddunken van die luchtvaartmaatschappij, via haar agenten, de afzet verzorgen van vervoer door de lucht.    

### Artikel  9  

(1).  De luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden op billijke en gelijke wijze in de gelegenheid gesteld de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes tussen hun onderscheiden grondgebieden te exploiteren.   
(2).  Bij de exploitatie van de omschreven routes houden de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij rekening met de belangen van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zodat de diensten die de laatstgenoemde luchtvaartmaatschappijen op dezelfde routes of een deel daarvan onderhouden, niet op onredelijke wijze worden getroffen.   
(3).  Bij de exploitatie van de omschreven routes dienen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeenstemming te bereiken over de diensten die nodig zijn om een toereikende capaciteit te bieden voor de redelijkerwijs te verwachten vraag naar vervoer. Mochten de luchtvaartmaatschappijen er niet in slagen overeenstemming te bereiken, dan is hun toegestaan hun dienstregelingen afzonderlijk bij de luchtvaartautoriteiten in te dienen. Deze dienstregelingen worden goedgekeurd tenzij de luchtvaartautoriteiten van één van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verzoeken om overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij omdat zij van oordeel zijn dat de belangen van hun eigen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen ernstig zullen worden geschaad ten gevolge van de voorgestelde exploitatie door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  10  

(1).  De tarieven die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden geheven voor het vervoer naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, worden op een redelijk niveau vastgesteld, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle relevante factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig deel van de omschreven route.   
(2).  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, te zamen met de voor agentenprovisie geldende tarieven, indien mogelijk, rechtstreeks overeengekomen tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of, naar keuze, in overleg met andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de gehele route of een deel daarvan exploiteren en, indien mogelijk, met behulp van de procedures voor het vaststellen van tarieven van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging.   
(3).  Alle tarieven worden ten minste vijfenveertig (45) dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van invoering aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd; in bijzondere gevallen kan deze termijn worden verkort, indien de genoemde autoriteiten daarin toestemmen.   
(4).  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over eeri bepaald tarief, of indien door enige andere oorzaak een bepaald tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien in de loop van de eerste eenentwintig (21) dagen van het tijdvak van vijfenveertig (45) dagen bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kennis geeft van haar bezwaar tegen een overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
(5).  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een bepaald tarief dat hun is voorgelegd overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, of omtrent de vaststelling van een bepaald tarief volgens het vierde lid, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst.   
(6).  Behoudens de bepalingen van het derde en het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt een tarief niet van kracht indien het niet door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is goedgekeurd.   
(7).  De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  11  

(1).  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen van iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stelt of stellen uiterlijk dertig dagen vóór de aanvang van de luchtdiensten op de overeenkomstig artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst omschreven routes de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in kennis van de te gebruiken typen luchtvaartuigen en de dienstregelingen. Dit is eveneens van toepassing op latere wijzigingen.   
(2).  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschaffen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op hun verzoek de periodieke of andere statistische gegevens die redelijkerwijs nodig zijn. Deze gegevens dienen tevens alle inlichtingen te bevatten die redelijkerwijs nodig zijn om de omvang van het vervoer te bepalen, vervoerd door deze luchtvaartmaatschappijen op de overeengekomen diensten alsmede, in het geval van overleg ingevolge artikel 9, derde lid, inlichtingen omtrent de herkomst en bestemming van dat vervoer.   

### Artikel  12  

(1).  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn vrij om vanuit het grondgebied van verkoop naar het grondgebied waar hun zetel is gevestigd het batig saldo over te maken van de ontvangsten en uitgaven in het grondgebied van verkoop. In deze netto-overmaking zijn begrepen inkomsten uit verkopen, rechtstreeks of via een agent, van luchtvervoersdiensten en van bijkomende of aanvullende diensten, en de gebruikelijke commerciële rente op deze inkomsten verkregen, terwijl zij op een depositorekening stonden in afwachting van de overmaking.   
(2).  Deze overmakingen zullen met een minimum aan administratief oponthoud worden goedgekeurd en geschieden binnen een redelijke termijn te rekenen van de datum van indiening van de desbetreffende aanvrage en zullen op dezelfde wijze worden behandeld als invoer van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in het algemeen.   

### Artikel  13  

(1).  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd met elkaar overleg ten einde de uitvoering en bevredigende naleving van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te verzekeren; zij plegen eveneens, indien noodzakelijk, overleg omtrent wijziging daarvan.   
(2).  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan het verzoek doen tot het plegen van overleg; dit overleg, hetwelk mondeling dan wel schriftelijk kan geschieden, moet een aanvang nemen binnen een tijdvak van zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek, tenzij beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen instemmen met verlenging van dit tijdvak.   
(3).  Wijzigingen of veranderingen van deze Overeenkomst, overeengekomen door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, treden in werking op een in een diplomatieke-notawisseling te bepalen datum.   
(4).  Wijzigingen of veranderingen van de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst worden schriftelijk overeengekomen tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten en treden onmiddellijk in werking.   

### Artikel  14  

(1).  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan in verband met de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen.   
(2).  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen, kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan een persoon of instantie; indien zij zulks niet overeenkomen, wordt het geschil op verzoek van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht, bestaande uit drie scheidsmannen, van wie één door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen en de derde, die als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht zal optreden, wordt benoemd door de twee andere aangewezenen. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wijst een scheidsman aan binnen zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst door één van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van een langs diplomatieke weg gedane kennisgeving, waarin om voorlegging van het geschil aan een scheidsgerecht wordt verzocht; de derde scheidsman wordt binnen het daaraan aansluitende tijdvak van eveneens zestig (60) dagen benoemd. Indien één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat binnen het aangegeven tijdvak een scheidsman aan te wijzen, of indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen het aangegeven tijdvak wordt benoemd, kan de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een scheidsman of eventueel scheidsmannen benoemen. In dat geval dient de derde scheidsman onderdaan te zijn van een derde staat en op te treden als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen onderwerpen zich aan iedere ingevolge het tweede lid van dit artikel genomen beslissing.   

### Artikel  15  

Indien er een door beide Partijen aanvaarde multilaterale overeenkomst betreffende onder deze Overeenkomst vallende aangelegenheden in werking treedt, treden de desbetreffende bepalingen van die overeenkomst in de plaats van de desbetreffende bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  16  

Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan te allen tijde de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mededeling doen van haar besluit deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen; deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In een dergelijk geval wordt de opzegging van kracht twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de opzegging in onderling overleg wordt ingetrokken vóór het einde van dit tijdvak. Indien de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij nalaat de ontvangst te bevestigen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
