d) The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances, at the request of a member in whose territories a portion of the loan is spent, repurchase with gold or foreign exchange a part of that member’s currency thus spent but in no case shall the part so repurchased exceed the amount by which the expenditure of the loan in those territories gives rise to an increased need for foreign exchange.   
###SECTION 4 PAYMENT PROVISIONS FOR DIRECT LOANS

Loan contracts under Section 1 (a) (i) or (ii) of this Article shall be made in accordance with the following payment provisions: 

a) The terms and conditions of interest and amortization payments, maturity and dates of payment of each loan shall be determined by the Bank. The Bank shall also determine the rate and any other terms and conditions of commission to be charged in connection with such loan. In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article during the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate of commission shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one-half percent per annum, and shall be charged on the outstanding portion of any such loan. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already made and to future loans, if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.  

b) All loan contracts shall stipulate the currency or currencies in which payments under the contract shall be made to the Bank. At the option of the borrowers however, such payments may be made in gold, or subject to the agreement of the Bank, in the currency of a member other than that prescribed in the contract. 

(i) In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (i) of this Article, the loan contracts shall provide that payments to the Bank of interest, other charges and amortization shall be made in the currency loaned, unless the member whose currency is loaned agrees that such payments shall be made in some other specified currency or currencies. These payments, subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (c), shall be equivalent to the value of such contractual payments at the time the loans were made, in terms of a currency specified for the purpose by the Bank by a three-fourths majority of the total voting power.  

(ii) In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article, the total amount outstanding and payable to the Bank in any one currency shall at no time exceed the total amount of the outstanding borrowings made by the Bank under Section 1 (a) (ii) and payable in the same currency.    

c) If a member suffers from an acute exchange stringency, so that the service of any loan contracted by that member or guaranteed by it or by one of its agencies cannot be provided in the stipulated manner, the member concerned may apply to the Bank for a relaxation of the conditions of payment. If the Bank is satisfied that some relaxation is in the interests of the particular member and of the operations of the Bank and of its members as a whole, it may take action under either, or both, of the following paragraphs with respect to the whole, or part, of the annual service: 

(i) The Bank may, in its discretion, make arrangements with the member concerned to accept service payments on the loan in the member’s currency for periods not to exceed three years upon appropriate terms regarding the use of such currency and the maintenance of its foreign exchange value; and for the repurchase of such currency on appropriate terms.  

(ii) The Bank may modify the terms of amortization or extend the life of the loan, or both.     
###SECTION 5 GUARANTEES

a) In guaranteeing a loan placed through the usual investment channels, the Bank shall charge a guarantee commission payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding at a rate determined by the Bank. During the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one-half percent per annum. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already guaranteed and to future loans if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.  

b) Guarantee commissions shall be paid directly to the Bank by the borrower.  

c) Guarantees by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed.  

d) The Bank shall have power to determine any other terms and conditions of the guarantee.   
###SECTION 6 SPECIAL RESERVE

The amount of commissions received by the Bank under Sections 4 and 5 of this Article shall be set aside as a special reserve, which shall be kept available for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted under this Agreement, as the Executive Directors may decide. 
###SECTION 7 METHODS OF MEETING LIABILITES OF THE BANK IN CASE OF DEFAULTS

In cases of default on loans made, participated in, or guaranteed by the Bank:

b) The payments in discharge of the Bank’s liabilities on borrowings or guarantees under Section 1 (a) (ii) and (iii) of this Article shall be charged: 

(i) first, against the special reserve provided in Section 6 of this Article;  

(ii) then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital available to the Bank.    

c) Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to similar payments on loans guaranteed by it, the Bank may call an appropriate amount of the unpaid subscriptions of members in accordance with Article II, Sections 5 and 7. Moreover, if it believes that a default may be of long duration, the Bank may call an additional amount of such unpaid subscriptions not to exceed in any one year one percent of the total subscriptions of the members for the following purposes: 

(i) To redeem prior to maturity, or otherwise discharge its liability on, all or part of the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in default.

In an emergency the Executive Directors may transfer all or any part of the Bank’s gold holdings to any place where they can be adequately protected.

If two percent is paid as a first charge, any balance remaining to be distributed shall be paid to all members in proportion to their shares. Payments to each member shall be made in its own currency, or if that currency is not available in other currency acceptable to the member. If such payments are made in currencies other than the member’s own currency, the transfer of the currency and its use by the receiving member after payment shall be without restriction by the members.

###SECTION 2 SUSPENSION OF MEMBERSHIP

If a member fails to fulfill any of its obligations to the Bank, the Bank may suspend its membership by decision of a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power. The member so suspended shall automatically cease to be a member one year from the date of its suspension unless a decision is taken by the same majority to restore the member to good standing. While under suspension, a member shall not be entitled to exercise any rights under this Agreement, except the right of withdrawal, but shall remain subject to all obligations. 
###SECTION 3 CESSATION OF MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Any member which ceases to be a member of the International Monetary Fund shall automatically cease after three months to be a member of the Bank unless the Bank by three-fourths of the total voting power has agreed to allow it to remain a member. 
###SECTION 4 SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS WITH GOVERNMENTS CEASING TO BE MEMBERS

a) When a government ceases to be a member, it shall remain liable for its direct obligations to the Bank and for its contingent liabilities to the Bank so long as any part of the loans or guarantees contracted before it ceased to be a member are outstanding; but it shall cease to incur liabilities with respect to loans and guarantees entered into thereafter by the Bank and to share either in the income or the expenses of the Bank.  

b) At the time a government ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of its shares as a part of the settlement of accounts with such government in accordance with the provisions of (c) and (d) below. For this purpose the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the day the government ceases to be a member.  

c) The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this section shall be governed by the following conditions: 

(i) Any amount due to the government for its shares shall be withheld so long as the government, its central bank or any of its agencies remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No amount shall be withheld on account of the liability of the government resulting from its subscription for shares under Article II, Section 5 (ii). In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six months after the date upon which the government ceases to be a member.  

(ii) Payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon their surrender by the government, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in (b) above exceeds the aggregate of liabilities on loans and guarantees in (c) (i) above until the former member has received the full repurchase price.  

(iii) Payments shall be made in the currency of the country receiving payment or at the option of the Bank in gold.  

(iv) If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees, participations in loans, or loans which were outstanding on the date when the government ceased to be a member, and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserve provided against losses on the date when the government ceased to be a member, such government shall be obligated to repay upon demand the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced, if the losses had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member government shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions under Article II Section 5 (ii), to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.    

d) If the Bank suspends permanently its operations under Section 5 (b) of this Article, within six months of the date upon which any government ceases to be a member, all rights of such government shall be determined by the provisions of Section 5 of this Article.   
###SECTION 5 SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS

a) In an emergency the Executive Directors may suspend temporarily operations in respect of new loans and guarantees pending an opportunity for further consideration and action by the Board of Governors.  

b) The Bank may suspend permanently its operations in respect of new loans and guarantees by a vote of a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power. After such suspension of operations the Bank shall forthwith cease all activities, except those incident to the orderly realization, conservation, and preservation of its assets and settlement of its obligations.  

c) The liability of all members for uncalled subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank and in respect of the depreciation of their own currencies shall continue until all claims of creditors, including all contingent claims, shall have been discharged.  

d) All creditors holding direct shall be paid out of the assets of the Bank, and then out of payments to the Bank on calls on unpaid subscriptions.

e) No distribution shall be made to members on account of their subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank until 

(i) all liabilities to creditors have been discharged or provided for, and  

(ii) a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power, have decided to make a distribution.    

f) After a decision to make a distribution has been taken under (e) above, the Executive Directors may by a two-thirds majority vote make successive distributions of the assets of the Bank to members until all of the assets have been distributed. This distribution shall be subject to the prior settlement of all outstanding claims of the Bank against each member.  

g) Before any distribution of assets is made, the Executive Directors shall fix the proportionate share of each member according to the ratio of its shareholding to the total outstanding shares of the Bank.  

h) The Executive Directors shall value the assets to be distributed as at the date of distribution and then proceed to distribute in the following manner: 

(i) There shall be paid to each member in its own obligations or those of its official agencies or legal entities within its territories, insofar as they are available for distribution, an amount equivalent in value to its proportionate share of the total amount to be distributed.  

(ii) Any balance due to a member after payment has been made under (i) above shall be paid, in its own currency, insofar as it is held by the Bank, up to an amount equivalent in value to such balance.  

(iii) Any balance due to a member after payment has been made under (i) and (ii) above shall be paid in gold or currency acceptable to the member, insofar as they are held by the Bank, up to an amount equivalent in value to such balance.  

(iv) Any remaining assets held by the Bank after payments have been made to members under (i), (ii), and (iii) above shall be distributed *pro rata* among the members.

iii. wanneer een lid onder i en ii hierboven in welke valuta dan ook betalingen verricht, worden deze betalingen verricht in bedragen die in waarde gelijk zijn aan de verplichting van het lid waarvan betaling gevorderd wordt.

###SECTIE 8 TIJDSTIP VAN BETALING VAN DE INSCHRIJVINGEN

a. De ingevolge sectie 7, onder i, van dit artikel in goud of Amerikaanse dollar verschuldigde twee percent op ieder aandeel wordt binnen zestig dagen na de datum waarop de Bank haar werkzaamheden aanvangt gestort, op voorwaarde dat: 

i. ieder oorspronkelijk lid van de Bank wiens moederland geleden heeft door vijandelijke bezetting of gevechtshandelingen in de huidige oorlog, het recht krijgt de betaling van een half percent tot vijf jaar na die datum uit te stellen;  

ii. een oorspronkelijk lid dat deze betaling niet kan verrichten aangezien het zijn goudreserves nog niet in bezit herkregen heeft, die nog steeds in beslag genomen of geblokkeerd zijn ten gevolge van de oorlog, iedere betaling kan uitstellen tot een door de Bank vast te stellen datum.    

b. Het restant van de prijs van ieder aandeel, verschuldigd ingevolge sectie 7, onder i, van dit artikel, wordt betaald op de wijze en het tijdstip als gevorderd door de Bank, op voorwaarde dat:

ii. de betaling van ten hoogste vijf percent van de prijs van het aandeel in een periode van drie maanden gevorderd zal worden.     
###SECTIE 9 HANDHAVING VAN DE WAARDE VAN BEPAALDE VALUTABEZITTINGEN VAN DE BANK

a. Steeds wanneer i. de pariwaarde van de valuta van een lid verlaagd wordt of ii. de buitenlandse deviezenwaarde van de valuta van een lid naar de mening van de Bank binnen het grondgebied van dat lid aanmerkelijk in waarde verminderd is, betaalt het lid binnen een redelijke termijn een aanvullend bedrag van zijn eigen valuta aan de Bank, voldoende om de waarde te handhaven, zoals die ten tijde van de eerste inschrijving was, van de bedragen aan de valuta van dat lid, die door de Bank gehouden worden en die afkomstig zijn van oorspronkelijk door het lid aan de Bank ingevolge artikel II, sectie 7, onder i, betaalde valuta, van valuta als bedoeld in artikel IV, sectie 2, onderdeel b, of van aanvullende valuta, verstrekt volgens de voorschriften van deze paragraaf en die door het lid niet teruggekocht zijn met goud of met de valuta van een lid, die voor de Bank aanvaardbaar is.  

b. Steeds wanneer de pariwaarde van de valuta van een lid verhoogd wordt, vergoedt de Bank aan een dergelijk lid binnen een redelijke termijn een bedrag aan de valuta van dat lid, gelijk aan de toename in de waarde van de bedragen aan die in a hierboven omschreven valuta.  

c. De bepalingen van de voorgaande paragrafen kunnen door de Bank terzijde worden gesteld, wanneer het Internationale Monetaire Fonds een uniforme proportionele wijziging in de pariwaardes van de valuta’s van al haar leden doorvoert.   
###SECTIE 10 BEPERKING VAN HET BESCHIKKINGSRECHT OVER DE AANDELEN

###SECTIE 4 VOORWAARDEN WAARONDER DE BANK GARANTIES OF LENINGEN KAN VERSTREKKEN

i. Dat, wanneer het lid op wiens grondgebied het project gelegen is, niet zelf de lening opneemt, het lid of de centrale bank of een vergelijkbare instantie van het lid die voor de Bank aanvaardbaar is, de terugbetaling van de hoofdsom en de betaling van de renten en andere kosten van de lening ten volle garandeert.  

ii. Dat de Bank overtuigd is dat de kredietnemer onder de bestaande marktverhoudingen niet in staat zou zijn de lening op andere wijze op te nemen onder voorwaarden die naar de mening van de Bank voor de kredietnemer redelijk zijn.  

iii. Dat een bevoegde commissie, als voorzien in artikel V, sectie 7, een schriftelijk rapport heeft ingediend, waarin het project, na een zorgvuldig onderzoek van de merites van het voorstel, aanbevolen wordt.  

iv. Dat de rentevoet en andere kosten naar de mening van de Bank redelijk zijn en deze rente, kosten en het plan van aflossing van de hoofdstom bij het project passen.  

v. Dat de Bank bij het verstrekken of garanderen van een lening de nodige aandacht aan de vooruitzichten schenkt, dat de kredietnemer en, indien de kredietnemer geen lid is, dat de borg, in staat zal zijn zijn uit de lening voortvloeiende verplichtingen na te komen; en dat de Bank met beleid zal optreden, zowel in het belang van het desbetreffende lid op wiens grondgebied het project is gelegen, als in het belang van alle leden.  

vi. Dat de Bank bij het garanderen van een door andere beleggers verstrekte lening een passende vergoeding voor haar risico ontvangt.

a. De Bank stelt niet als voorwaarde dat de opbrengst van een lening op de grondgebieden van een bepaald lid of bepaalde leden moet worden besteed.  

b. De Bank treft maatregelen om te verzekeren dat de opbrengst van iedere lening uitsluitend gebruikt wordt voor het doel waarvoor de lening verstrekt werd, waarbij de nodige aandacht wordt besteed aan economische en efficiënte overwegingen en zonder rekening te houden met politieke of andere niet-economische factoren of overwegingen.  

c. In het geval van door de Bank verstrekte leningen opent zij een rekening op naam van de kredietnemer en crediteert deze voor het bedrag van de lening in de valuta of valuta’s waarin de lening luidt. De Bank staat de kredietnemer uitsluitend toe ten laste van die rekening gelden op te nemen ten behoeve van uitgaven in verband met het project zodra deze daadwerkelijk moeten worden gedaan.

a. De Bank kan leningen, die aan de algemene voorwaarden van Artikel III voldoen, op een van de volgende wijzen verstrekken of vergemakkelijken: 

i. Door het verstrekken van of het deelnemen in directe leningen uit haar eigen gelden, overeenkomend met haar onaangetast gestort kapitaal en surplus en, behoudens het bepaalde in sectie 6 van dit artikel, haar reserves.  

ii. Door het verstrekken van of deelnemen in directe leningen uit gelden die op de markt van een lid opgenomen, of op andere wijze door de Bank geleend zijn.

b. De Bank kan op grond van het hierboven vermelde onder a, onder ii gelden lenen of volgens a, onder iii leningen garanderen, doch uitsluitend met goedkeuring van het lid, op wiens markt de gelden opgenomen worden en van het lid in wiens valuta de lening luidt, en slechts indien deze leden erin toestemmen dat de opbrengsten zonder beperkingen in de valuta van enig ander lid kunnen worden omgewisseld.   
###SECTIE 2 BESCHIKBAARHEID EN OVERDRAAGBAARHEID VAN VALUTA’S

a. Valuta’s die ingevolge artikel II, sectie 7, onder i, bij de Bank gestort zijn, worden slechts met toestemming, voor ieder geval afzonderlijk, van het lid wiens valuta erbij betrokken is, uitgeleend worden; met dien verstande echter, dat indien noodzakelijk, nadat van het gehele geplaatste kapitaal van de Bank de storting gevorderd is, zulke valuta’s, zonder beperking door de leden wier valuta’s aangeboden worden, gebruikt of in die valuta’s omgewisseld worden, die nodig zijn om contractuele rente, andere kosten of aflossingen ten behoeve van de door de Bank zelf opgenomen leningen te betalen of om de verplichtingen van de Bank na te komen, die betrekking hebben op dergelijke contractuele betalingen voor leningen, die door de Bank gegarandeerd zijn.  

b. Valuta’s die door de Bank van kredietnemers of borgen in betaling worden ontvangen ter aflossing van directe leningen, die in de valuta’s, hierboven onder a bedoeld, verleend zijn, worden in de valuta’s van andere leden slechts met de toestemming, voor ieder geval afzonderlijk van die leden, wier valuta’s erbij betrokken zijn, omgewisseld of weer uitgeleend; met dien verstande echter, dat indien noodzakelijk, nadat van het gehele geplaatste kapitaal van de Bank de storting gevorderd is, dergelijke valuta’s, zonder beperking door de leden wier valuta’s aangeboden worden, gebruikt of in die valuta’s omgewisseld worden, die nodig zijn om contractuele rente, andere kosten of aflossingen ten behoeve van door de Bank zelf opgenomen leningen te betalen of om de verplichtingen van de Bank na te komen, die betrekking hebben op dergelijke contractuele betalingen voor leningen, die door de Bank gegarandeerd zijn.  

c. Valuta’s die door de Bank van kredietnemers of borgen in betaling ontvangen worden ter aflossing van directe leningen door de Bank ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii, van dit artikel verstrekt, worden zonder beperking van de zijde van de leden gehouden en gebruikt voor het betalen van aflossingen, of voor de vervroegde betaling op of terugkoop van een deel of van alle eigen verplichtingen van de Bank.  

d. Alle andere valuta’s waarover de Bank beschikt, met inbegrip van die welke op de markt opgenomen of op andere wijze ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii, van dit artikel geleend zijn, alsmede van die welke tegen verkoop van goud verkregen zijn, van die welke ter betaling van rente en andere kosten van directe leningen, verstrekt ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder i en ii, ontvangen zijn, en van die welke ter voldoening van provisies en andere kosten ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder iii, ontvangen zijn, worden zonder beperking van de zijde van de leden, wier valuta’s worden aangeboden, gebruikt of in andere valuta’s of in goud omgewisseld, indien dit nodig is voor de werkzaamheden van de Bank.  

e. Valuta’s die op de markten van leden door kredietnemers opgenomen worden op leningen, die door de Bank ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder iii, van dit artikel gegarandeerd zijn, worden eveneens, zonder beperking van de zijde van deze leden, gebruikt of in andere valuta’s omgewisseld.   
###SECTIE 3 BESCHIKBAARSTELLING VAN VALUTA’S VOOR DIRECTE LENINGEN

De volgende bepalingen zijn van toepassing op directe leningen ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder i en ii, van dit artikel: 

a. De Bank verstrekt de kredietnemer die valuta’s van leden – andere dan het lid op wiens grondgebied het project gelegen is – die door de kredietnemer benodigd zijn voor uitgaven op de grondgebieden van deze andere leden, teneinde het doel van de lening te verwezenlijken.  

b. De Bank kan in buitengewone omstandigheden, indien de plaatselijke valuta, die voor het doel van de lening nodig is, niet onder redelijke voorwaarden door de kredietnemer opgenomen kan worden, de kredietnemer als onderdeel van de lening, een passend bedrag aan deze valuta ter beschikking stellen.  

c. De Bank kan, wanneer het project indirect tot een grotere behoefte aan buitenlandse deviezen voor het lid op wiens grondgebied het project gelegen is, aanleiding geeft, de kredietnemer in buitengewone omstandigheden als onderdeel van de lening een passend bedrag aan goud of buitenlandse deviezen ter beschikking stellen, dat niet de plaatselijke uitgaven van de kredietnemer in verband met het doel van de lening te boven gaat.  

d. De Bank kan in buitengewone omstandigheden op verzoek van een lid op wiens grondgebied een deel van de lening wordt besteed, een gedeelte van de aldus bestede valuta van dat lid tegen goud of buitenlandse deviezen terugkopen, maar het aldus teruggekochte deel zal in geen geval het bedrag te boven gaan, waarmee het gebruik van de lening op dit grondgebied aanleiding geeft tot een verhoogde behoefte aan buitenlandse deviezen.   
###SECTIE 4 BETALINGSVOORSCHRIFTEN VOOR DIRECTE LENINGEN

Leningsovereenkomsten krachtens sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder i of ii, van dit artikel worden in overeenstemming met de volgende betalingsvoorwaarden afgesloten: 

a. De bepalingen en voorwaarden van rente- en aflossingsbetalingen, van de looptijd en van de betaaldagen van iedere lening worden door de Bank vastgesteld. De Bank stelt ook het percentage en alle overige bepalingen en voorwaarden voor de in verband met een dergelijke lening te berekenen provisie vast. In het geval van leningen, die ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii, van dit artikel verleend zijn gedurende de eerste tien jaar waarin de Bank operationeel is, bedraagt het percentage van deze provisie ten minste een percent per jaar en ten hoogste anderhalf percent per jaar, en wordt over het uitstaande bedrag van iedere zodanige lening berekend. Aan het eind van deze periode van tien jaar kan het provisiepercentage door de Bank verlaagd worden, zowel ten aanzien van het uitstaande deel van reeds verstrekte leningen als ten aanzien van toekomstige leningen, indien de reserves, door de Bank ingevolge sectie 6 van dit artikel en uit andere inkomsten gevormd, door haar voldoende geacht worden om een verlaging te rechtvaardigen. In geval van toekomstige leningen staat het de Bank ook vrij het provisiepercentage tot boven de voornoemde grens te verhogen, wanneer een dergelijke verhoging volgens de ervaring raadzaam is.  

b. Alle leningsovereenkomsten stipuleren de valuta of de valuta’s waarin de betalingen ingevolge de overeenkomst aan de Bank dienen te worden verricht. Naar keuze van de kredietnemers kunnen deze betalingen echter in goud, of met toestemming van de Bank, in de valuta van een ander lid dan gestipuleerd in de overeenkomst, worden gedaan. 

i. In het geval van leningen, die krachtens sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder i, van dit artikel verstrekt zijn, schrijven de leningsovereenkomsten voor dat betalingen aan de Bank van rente, andere kosten en aflossing, geschieden in de valuta waarin geleend werd, tenzij het lid wiens valuta geleend werd, erin toestemt dat dergelijke betalingen in een andere omschreven valuta of valuta’s plaatsvinden. Deze betalingen zullen, behoudens het bepaalde in artikel II, sectie 9, onderdeel c, in waarde gelijk zijn aan dergelijke contractuele betalingen op de datum waarop de leningen werden afgesloten, uitgedrukt in een voor dit doel door de Bank met een meerderheid van drie vierde van het totaal aantal stemmen aangewezen valuta.  

ii. In het geval van overeenkomstig sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii, van dit artikel verstrekte leningen gaat het totale in een valuta uitstaande en aan de Bank te betalen bedrag, het totaal van de uitstaande bedragen die door de Bank ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii, geleend zijn en in dezelfde valuta verschuldigd zijn, nooit te boven.    

c. Wanneer de deviezenpositie van een lid zeer krap geworden is, zodat de schuldendienst van een lening, die door dat lid opgenomen of door hem of een van zijn instanties gegarandeerd is, niet op de voorgeschreven wijze afgewikkeld kan worden, kan het betrokken lid bij de Bank een verzoek indienen om de betalingsvoorwaarden te verzachten. Indien de Bank de overtuiging heeft dat enige verzachting in het belang is van het betreffende lid en van de werkzaamheden van de Bank en van haar leden gezamenlijk, kan zij volgens een of beide van de volgende paragrafen handelen ten aanzien van het geheel of een gedeelte van de jaarlijkse schuldendienst: 

i. De Bank kan naar haar goeddunken met het desbetreffende lid regelingen treffen om betalingen aan te nemen ten behoeve van de dienst van de lening in de valuta van het lid voor periodes van ten hoogste drie jaar, tegen behoorlijke voorwaarden ten aanzien van de aanwending van deze valuta en de handhaving van haar buitenlandse deviezenwaarde en voor het terugkopen van dergelijke valuta tegen passende voorwaarden.  

ii. De Bank kan de voorwaarden van aflossing wijzigen of de looptijd van de lening verlengen, of beide maatregelen nemen.     
###SECTIE 5 GARANTIES

a. Bij het garanderen van een lening, die via de gebruikelijke investeringskanalen geplaatst wordt, berekent de Bank een garantieprovisie die over het uitstaande bedrag van de lening tegen een door de Bank vastgesteld percentage, periodiek verschuldigd zal zijn. Gedurende de eerste tien jaar waarin de Bank operationeel is bedraagt dit percentage ten minste een percent per jaar en ten hoogste anderhalf percent per jaar. Aan het eind van deze periode van tien jaar kan het provisiepercentage door de Bank verlaagd worden, zowel ten aanzien van het uitstaande deel van reeds gegarandeerde leningen als ten aanzien van toekomstige leningen, indien de reserves, door de Bank ingevolge sectie 6 van dit artikel en uit andere inkomsten gevormd, door haar voldoende worden geacht om een verlaging te rechtvaardigen. In het geval van toekomstige leningen staat het de Bank ook vrij het provisiepercentage tot boven de voornoemde grens te verhogen, wanneer een dergelijke verhoging volgens de ervaring raadzaam is.  

b. Garantieprovisies worden door de kredietnemer rechtstreeks aan de Bank betaald.  

c. Door de Bank verleende garanties bepalen dat de Bank haar verplichtingen ten aanzien van de rente kan beëindigen, indien de Bank bij in gebreke blijven van de kredietnemer of van de eventuele borg, aanbiedt de gegarandeerde obligaties of andere schuldpapieren tegen de nominale waarde te kopen en met de ontstane rente, tot een in het aanbod vermelde datum.  

d. De Bank is bevoegd andere bepalingen en voorwaarden te stellen aan de garantie.   
###SECTIE 6 BIJZONDERE RESERVE

Het bedrag van de door de Bank ingevolge sectie 4 en 5 van dit artikel ontvangen provisies wordt opzij gezet als een bijzondere reserve, die beschikbaar gehouden wordt om verplichtingen van de Bank overeenkomstig sectie 7 van dit artikel na te komen. Deze bijzondere reserve moet in een zodanige volgens deze Overeenkomst toegestane liquide vorm gehouden worden, als het College van Bewindvoerders beslist. 
###SECTIE 7 WIJZEN VAN NAKOMEN VAN VERPLICHTINGEN DOOR DE BANK IN GEVAL VAN WANBETALINGEN

Bij wanbetalingen ten aanzien van door de Bank verstrekte of gegarandeerde leningen of leningen waarin de Bank heeft deelgenomen: 

a. treft de Bank alle mogelijke maatregelen om de verplichtingen die uit de leningen voortvloeien te regelen, inclusief maatregelen volgens en vergelijkbaar met sectie 4, onderdeel c, van dit artikel.  

b. Voor betalingen tot nakoming van de verplichtingen van de Bank ten aanzien van leningen of garanties ingevolge sectie 1, onderdeel a, onder ii en iii, van dit artikel, zullen aangesproken worden: 

i. ten eerste de bijzondere reserve, zoals voorzien in sectie 6 van dit artikel;  

ii. vervolgens, in de vereiste omvang en naar goeddunken van de Bank, de andere reserves, het surplus en het kapitaal dat de Bank ter beschikking staat.    

c. Steeds wanneer dit nodig is om de contractuele betalingen van rente, andere kosten of aflossing op de door de Bank zelf opgenomen leningen te betalen of de verplichtingen van de Bank met betrekking tot overeenkomstige betalingen op leningen die door de Bank gegarandeerd zijn, na te komen, kan de Bank ingevolge artikel II, sectie 5 en 7, een dienovereenkomstig bedrag van de niet-betaalde inschrijvingen van de leden vorderen. Bovendien kan de Bank wanneer zij verwacht dat een wanbetaling langdurig zal zijn, de betaling vorderen van een extra bedrag van dergelijke nog niet betaalde inschrijvingen, dat echter in geen enkel jaar een percent van het totaal van de inschrijvingen van de leden te boven mag gaan, voor de volgende doeleinden: 

i. Om de gehele of een gedeelte van de uitstaande hoofdsom van een door haar gegarandeerde lening voor de vervaldag af te lossen of op andere wijze haar verplichting na te komen wanneer de schuldenaar in gebreke is.  

ii. Om door haarzelf opgenomen leningen geheel of gedeeltelijk terug te kopen of haar verplichtingen ten aanzien daarvan op andere wijze na te komen.     
###SECTIE 8 DIVERSE WERKZAAMHEDEN

Naast de elders in deze Overeenkomst beschreven werkzaamheden, heeft de Bank de bevoegdheid: 

i. waardepapieren die zij uitgegeven heeft te kopen en te verkopen en waardepapieren die zij gegarandeerd heeft of waarin zij geïnvesteerd heeft, te kopen en te verkopen, met dien verstande dat de Bank de toestemming verkrijgt van het lid, op wiens grondgebied de waardepapieren gekocht of verkocht zullen worden.  

ii. waardepapieren te garanderen waarin zij geïnvesteerd heeft, teneinde de verkoop daarvan te vergemakkelijken.  

iii. de valuta van welk lid dan ook met de toestemming van dat lid te lenen.  

iv. de andere waardepapieren te kopen en te verkopen die de Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen geschikt achten voor de belegging van het geheel of een deel van de bijzondere reserve ingevolge sectie 6 van dit artikel.   Bij het uitoefenen van de haar ingevolge deze sectie verleende bevoegdheden kan de Bank met iedere persoon, firma, vereniging, vennootschap of andere rechtspersoon op het grondgebied van enig lid in verbinding treden. 
###SECTIE 9 OP DE WAARDEPAPIEREN TE PLAATSEN WAARSCHUWING

Ieder waardepapier dat door de Bank gegarandeerd of uitgegeven wordt, is op de voorzijde voorzien van een duidelijk zichtbare verklaring met de strekking dat het geen schuldverplichting van een regering is, tenzij dit uitdrukkelijk op het waardepapier vermeld is. 
###SECTIE 10 VERBOD OP POLITIEKE ACTIVITEIT

De Bank en haar ambtenaren mogen zich niet in de politieke aangelegenheden van enig lid mengen; noch zullen zij zich bij hun beslissingen door het politieke karakter van het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden laten beïnvloeden. Slechts economische overwegingen zullen bij hun beslissingen ter zake dienen en deze overwegingen zullen onpartijdig afgewogen worden, teneinde de in artikel I vermelde doelstellingen te verwezenlijken.  

### Artikel  V  

####Organisatie en beheer

###SECTIE 1 STRUCTUUR VAN DE BANK

De Bank heeft een Raad van Bestuur, een College van Bewindvoerders, een President en de andere ambtenaren en employés die nodig zijn om de werkzaamheden te verrichten die de Bank kan vaststellen. 
###SECTIE 2 RAAD VAN BESTUUR

a. Alle bevoegdheden van de Bank berusten bij de Raad van Bestuur, die bestaat uit een bestuurder en een plaatsvervanger per lid die op een door hem te bepalen wijze worden benoemd. Iedere bestuurder en iedere plaatsvervanger bekleedt zijn ambt voor een periode van vijf jaar, mits het lid dat hem benoemt hem handhaaft en kan herkozen worden. Een plaatsvervanger heeft geen stemrecht, behalve bij afwezigheid van zijn principaal. De Raad kiest een van de bestuurders tot voorzitter.  

b. De Raad van Bestuur kan het College van Bewindvoerders de bevoegdheid overdragen al zijn rechten uit te oefenen, behalve de bevoegdheid: 

i. nieuwe leden toe te laten en de voorwaarden van hun toelating vast te stellen;  

ii. het aandelenkapitaal te verhogen of te verlagen;  

iii. een lid te schorsen;  

iv. te beslissen omtrent beroepen naar aanleiding van interpretaties van deze Overeenkomst door het College van Bewindvoerders;  

v. regelingen te treffen voor samenwerking met andere internationale organisaties (andere dan niet-officiële regelingen van tijdelijke en administratieve aard);  

vi. te besluiten de werkzaamheden van de Bank voorgoed te staken en haar activa te verdelen;  

vii. de verdeling van de nettowinst van de Bank vast te stellen.    

c. De Raad van Bestuur houdt een jaarlijkse vergadering en de andere vergaderingen die de Raad nodig acht of door het College van Bewindvoerders bijeengeroepen worden. Bewindvoerders roepen vergaderingen van de Raad bijeen, wanneer daarom verzocht wordt door vijf leden of door leden die een vierde van het totale aantal stemmen bezitten.  

d. Het quorum voor een vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur bestaat uit een meerderheid van de bestuurders die ten minste twee derde van het totale aantal stemmen bezitten.  

e. De Raad van Bestuur kan bij reglement een procedure vaststellen waarbij het College van Bewindvoerders, wanneer het dit in het belang van de Bank acht, om een beslissing van de bestuurders betreffende een bepaald vraagstuk kan verzoeken, zonder daarvoor een vergadering van de Raad bijeen te roepen.  

f. De Raad van Bestuur en, voor zover daartoe gemachtigd, het College van Bewindvoerders, kunnen de voorschriften en regelingen aannemen die nodig of relevant zijn voor de werkzaamheden van de Bank.  

g. Bestuurders en plaatsvervangers nemen hun functies als zodanig waar zonder een vergoeding van de Bank, maar de Bank geeft hun een redelijke vergoeding voor de kosten die zij gemaakt hebben om de vergaderingen bij te wonen.  

h. De Raad van Bestuur stelt de aan de bewindvoerders te betalen beloning en het salaris en de voorwaarden van het arbeidscontract van de President vast.   
###SECTIE 3 STEMRECHT

a. Ieder lid heeft tweehonderdvijftig stemmen plus één extra stem voor ieder aandeel in het kapitaal in zijn bezit.  

b. Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders voorzien, worden alle besluiten van de Bank genomen bij meerderheid van het aantal uitgebrachte stemmen.   
###SECTIE 4 HET COLLEGE VAN BEWINDVOERDERS

a. Het College van Bewindvoerders is verantwoordelijk voor de leiding van de algemene werkzaamheden van de Bank en oefent alle bevoegdheden uit die door de Raad van Bestuur aan het College overgedragen zijn.  

b. Er zijn twaalf bewindvoerders, die geen bestuurders hoeven te zijn, waarvan er: 

i. vijf benoemd worden en wel door ieder van de vijf leden met het grootste aantal aandelen;  

ii. zeven gekozen worden overeenkomstig Schema B, door alle bestuurders, behalve degenen die door de onder i genoemde vijf leden benoemd zijn.   Voor deze paragraaf worden onder  „leden” verstaan, de regeringen van de landen genoemd in Schema A, ongeacht of zij oorspronkelijke leden zijn of tot het lidmaatschap toetreden ingevolge artikel II, sectie I, onderdeel b. Indien de regeringen van andere landen tot het lidmaatschap toetreden, kan de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van vier vijfde van het totale aantal stemmen het totaal aantal bewindvoerders vergroten door het aantal te kiezen bewindvoerders uit te breiden. De bewindvoerders worden elke twee jaar benoemd of gekozen.  

c. Iedere bewindvoerder benoemt een plaatsvervanger met de algehele bevoegdheid voor hem op te treden, wanneer hij niet aanwezig is. Ook wanneer de bewindvoerders die hen benoemen aanwezig zijn, kunnen hun plaatsvervangers de vergaderingen bijwonen doch zonder stemrecht.  

d. Bewindvoerders blijven in functie totdat hun opvolgers benoemd of gekozen zijn. Indien de plaats van een gekozen bewindvoerder meer dan negentig dagen voor het einde van zijn ambtsperiode vacant wordt, wordt voor het resterende deel van de ambtsperiode een andere bewindvoerder gekozen door de bestuurders die de vorige bewindvoerder gekozen hebben. Voor de verkiezing is een meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen vereist. Zolang de functie onvervuld blijft, oefent de plaatsvervanger van de vorige bewindvoerder zijn rechten uit, behalve het recht een plaatsvervanger te benoemen.  

e. De bewindvoerders oefenen hun functies permanent uit op het hoofdkantoor van de Bank en vergaderen zo vaak als de werkzaamheden van de Bank dit vereisen.  

f. Het quorum voor een vergadering van het College van Bewindvoerders bestaat uit een meerderheid van de bewindvoerders, die ten minste de helft van het totale aantal stemmen uitoefenen.  

g. Iedere benoemde bewindvoerder is gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat ingevolge sectie 3 van dit artikel aan het lid dat hem benoemt toegekend is. Iedere gekozen bewindvoerder is gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen die hij bij zijn verkiezing op zich verenigd zag. Alle stemmen die een bewindvoerder gerechtigd is uit te brengen, worden als één geheel uitgebracht.  

h. De Raad van Bestuur stelt maatregelen vast, zodat leden die ingevolge b hierboven niet gerechtigd zijn een bewindvoerder te benoemen, iedere vergadering van het College van Bewindvoerders door een vertegenwoordiger kunnen doen bijwonen, waarin beraadslaagd wordt over een verzoek van dat lid of een vraagstuk waarbij het nauw betrokken is.  

i. De bewindvoerders kunnen, wanneer zij dit raadzaam achten, commissies benoemen. Het lidmaatschap van die commissies behoeft niet beperkt te blijven tot bestuurders, bewindvoerders of hun plaatsvervangers.   
###SECTIE 5 PRESIDENT EN PERSONEEL

a. Het College van Bewindvoerders benoemt een President, die geen bestuurder, bewindvoerder of plaatsvervanger is. De President is voorzitter van het College van Bewindvoerders, maar heeft geen stemrecht, behalve een beslissende stem bij het staken van de stemmen. Hij kan deelnemen aan de vergaderingen van de Raad van Bestuur, maar brengt geen stem uit in deze vergaderingen. De President treedt af wanneer het College van Bewindvoerders daartoe besluit.

b. De Bank kan andere activa, met inbegrip van goud, in bewaring geven bij de plaatsen van deponering, die aangewezen zijn door de vijf leden met het grootste aantal aandelen en op andere aangewezen plaatsen van deponering, die de Bank kan kiezen. Aanvankelijk wordt ten minste de helft van het goudbezit van de Bank bewaard op de plaats van deponering aangewezen door het lid op het grondgebied waarvan de Bank haar hoofdkantoor heeft en ten minste 40 percent op de plaatsen van deponering aangewezen door de overige hierboven aangeduide vier leden, waarbij op ieder van dergelijke plaatsen van deponering aanvankelijk niet minder gehouden zal worden dan het bedrag aan goud dat gestort werd op de aandelen van het lid dat de plaats van deponering aanwees. Alle overdrachten van goud door de Bank worden echter verricht met inachtneming van de transportkosten en verwachte behoeften van de Bank. In onvoorziene omstandigheden kan het College van Bewindvoerders het geheel of een deel van het goudbezit van de Bank overbrengen naar een plaats waar het doeltreffend beschermd kan worden.   
###SECTIE 12 HOEDANIGHEID VAN HET VALUTABEZIT

Indien als eerste betaling twee percent uitgekeerd wordt, wordt het saldo dat voor uitkering overblijft, aan alle leden uitbetaald naar rato van hun aandelenbezit. De betalingen aan ieder lid vinden plaats in zijn eigen valuta of, indien deze valuta niet beschikbaar is, in een andere voor het lid aanvaardbare valuta.

### Artikel  VI  

####Intrekking en schorsing van het lidmaatschap; opschorting van werkzaamheden

###SECTIE 1 RECHT VAN DE LEDEN OP TERUGTREKKING

Ieder lid kan zich te allen tijde terugtrekken uit de Bank door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan het hoofdkantoor van de Bank. De terugtrekking wordt van kracht op de datum van ontvangst van een dergelijke kennisgeving. 
###SECTIE 2 SCHORSING VAN LIDMAATSCHAP

Indien een lid tekortschiet in het nakomen van een van zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Bank, kan de Bank zijn lidmaatschap schorsen bij besluit van een meerderheid van de bestuurders, die een meerderheid van het totale aantal stemmen uitoefenen. Een op deze wijze geschorst lid houdt een jaar na de datum van zijn schorsing automatisch op lid te zijn, tenzij bij dezelfde meerderheid besloten wordt het lid in ere te herstellen. Zolang een lid geschorst is, is het niet gerechtigd tot uitoefening van enig recht ingevolge deze Overeenkomst, behalve het recht op terugtrekking, en blijft het gebonden aan alle verplichtingen. 
###SECTIE 3 EINDE VAN HET LIDMAATSCHAP VAN HET INTERNATIONALE MONETAIRE FONDS

Ieder lid dat ophoudt lid van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds te zijn, houdt na drie maanden automatisch op lid van de Bank te zijn, tenzij de Bank er bij een meerderheid van drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen mee instemt dat het lid blijft. 
###SECTIE 4 VEREFFENING VAN REKENINGEN MET REGERINGEN DIE NIET LANGER LID ZIJN

a. Wanneer een regering ophoudt lid te zijn, blijft zij aansprakelijk voor haar directe verplichtingen en voor haar indirecte verplichtingen tegenover de Bank, zolang een deel van de leningen of garanties, die verstrekt werden voordat zij ophield lid te zijn, nog uitstaat. Zij wordt evenwel niet meer betrokken bij verplichtingen ten aanzien van leningen en garanties, die op een later tijdstip door de Bank verstrekt worden en deelt niet in de winsten of de onkosten van de Bank.  

b. Op het tijdstip waarop een regering ophoudt lid te zijn, treft de Bank als onderdeel van de vereffening van de rekeningen met een dergelijke regering maatregelen voor de terugkoop van haar aandelen in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in c en d hieronder. Voor dit doel zal de prijs waarvoor de aandelen teruggekocht worden, gelijk zijn aan de waarde die blijkt uit de boeken van de Bank op de dag waarop de regering ophoudt lid te zijn.  

c. Op de betaling van aandelen die krachtens deze sectie door de Bank teruggekocht zijn zijn de volgende voorwaarden van toepassing: 

i. Ieder bedrag dat aan de regering voor haar aandelen verschuldigd is, wordt ingehouden zolang de regering, haar centrale bank of een van haar instanties als kredietnemer of borg aansprakelijk blijft jegens de Bank en een dergelijk bedrag kan, naar keuze van de Bank, voor een dergelijke verplichting aangewend worden zodra deze vervalt. Geen bedrag wordt ingehouden uit hoofde van de verplichting van de regering, die voortvloeit uit haar intekening op aandelen krachtens artikel II, sectie 5, onder ii. In geen geval zal een bedrag dat aan een lid voor zijn aandelen verschuldigd is, eerder uitbetaald worden dan zes maanden na de datum waarop de regering opgehouden heeft lid te zijn.  

ii. Betalingen voor aandelen kunnen van tijd tot tijd verricht worden bij inlevering van de betreffende aandelen door de regering in de mate waarin het bedrag verschuldigd als de in b hierboven bedoelde terugkoopprijs het totaal van de verplichtingen ten aanzien van leningen en garanties in c, i, hierboven te boven gaat, totdat het voormalig lid de volledige terugkoopprijs ontvangen heeft.  

iii. Betalingen geschieden in de valuta van het land dat de betaling ontvangt, of naar keuze van de Bank, in goud.  

iv. Indien de Bank verlies lijdt op een garantie, deelneming in leningen of lening die op de datum waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn, uitstond en het bedrag van een dergelijk verlies het totaal van de tegen verlies gevormde reserve op de datum waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn te boven gaat, is deze regering verplicht desgevraagd het bedrag terug te betalen waarmee de terugkoopprijs van haar aandelen verminderd zou zijn, indien met de verliezen rekening gehouden zou zijn toen de terugkoopprijs vastgesteld werd. Daarnaast blijft de regering als voormalig lid aansprakelijk voor iedere oproep tot voldoening van niet-gestorte inschrijvingen ingevolge artikel II, sectie 5, onder ii, tot het bedrag waarvoor het verzocht zou zijn op te komen, indien het kapitaalverlies en de oproep plaatsgevonden zouden hebben op het tijdstip waarop de terugkoopprijs van haar aandelen vastgesteld werd.    

d. Indien de Bank haar werkzaamheden voorgoed staakt ingevolge sectie 5, onderdeel b, van dit artikel binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop een regering ophoudt lid te zijn, worden alle rechten van deze regering vastgesteld ingevolge de bepalingen van sectie 5 van dit artikel.   
###SECTIE 5 OPSCHORTING VAN DE WERKZAAMHEDEN EN VEREFFENING VAN VERPLICHTINGEN

a. Bij onvoorziene omstandigheden kan het College van Bewindvoerders de werkzaamheden ten aanzien van nieuwe leningen en garanties tijdelijk opschorten in afwachting van een gelegenheid tot verder overleg en maatregelen van de Raad van Bestuur.  

b. De Bank kan bij meerderheid van de bestuurders die een meerderheid van het totale aantal stemmen uitoefenen haar werkzaamheden ten aanzien van nieuwe leningen en garanties voorgoed op te schorten. Na opschorting van de werkzaamheden beëindigt de Bank terstond alle werkzaamheden, behalve die welke nodig zijn voor het ordelijk te gelde maken, in stand houden en beschermen van haar activa en het vereffenen van haar schulden.  

c. De verplichting van alle leden uit hoofde van niet-gevorderde inschrijvingen op het aandelenkapitaal van de Bank en bij waardevermindering van hun valuta’s, blijft bestaan totdat alle vorderingen van crediteuren, daarbij inbegrepen alle voorwaardelijke vorderingen, voldaan zijn.  

d. Alle crediteuren die directe vorderingen bezitten, worden betaald uit de activa van de Bank en vervolgens uit de aan de Bank verrichte betalingen na vordering van niet-betaalde inschrijvingen. Voordat betaling aan crediteuren die directe vorderingen bezitten plaatsvindt, treffen de bewindvoerders de naar hun mening nodige maatregelen om een uitkering aan de houders van voorwaardelijke vorderingen te verzekeren vergelijkbaar met die aan crediteuren die directe vorderingen bezitten.  

e. Geen uitkering wordt verricht aan leden uit hoofde van hun inschrijving op het aandelenkapitaal van de Bank, voordat: 

i. alle verplichtingen jegens de crediteuren vereffend of geregeld zijn; en  

ii. een meerderheid van de bestuurders die een meerderheid van het totale aantal stemmen uitoefenen, besloten heeft tot uitkering over te gaan.    

f. Nadat besloten is over te gaan tot uitkering ingevolge e hierboven, kunnen de bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal stemmen opeenvolgende uitkeringen ten laste van de activa van de Bank aan leden verrichten totdat de activa geheel verdeeld zijn. Voorwaarde voor deze uitkering is dat voorafgaand alle uitstaande vorderingen van de Bank op ieder lid vereffend zijn.  

g. Voordat uitkering van de activa plaatsvindt, stellen de bewindvoerders het evenredige aandeel daarin van ieder lid vast naar rato van zijn aandelenbezit tot het totale aantal uitstaande aandelen van de Bank.  

h. De bewindvoerders hanteren de waarde die gold op de datum van de uitkering als de waarde van de uit te keren activa en gaan bij de verdeling als volgt te werk: 

i. Aan ieder lid wordt in zijn eigen schuldbekentenissen, of die van zijn officiële instanties of rechtspersonen op zijn grondgebied, voor zover deze voor verdeling beschikbaar zijn, een bedrag uitbetaald, gelijk in waarde aan zijn evenredig aandeel in het totaal uit te keren bedrag.  

ii. Enig saldo dat aan een lid verschuldigd blijft nadat betaling ingevolge i hierboven heeft plaatsgevonden, wordt betaald in zijn eigen valuta, voor zover deze door de Bank gehouden wordt, tot een bedrag dat qua waarde gelijk is aan dat saldo.  

iii. Enig saldo dat aan een lid verschuldigd blijft nadat betaling onder i en ii hierboven heeft plaatsgevonden, wordt betaald in goud of een voor het lid aanvaardbare valuta, voor zover deze door de Bank gehouden wordt, tot een bedrag dat qua waarde gelijk is aan dat saldo.  

iv. Alle overblijvende activa die door de Bank worden gehouden worden nadat betaling aan de leden ingevolge i, ii en iii hierboven is geschied, pro rata verdeeld onder de leden.    

i. Ieder lid, dat ingevolge h hierboven door de Bank verdeelde activa ontvangt, oefent ten aanzien van deze activa dezelfde rechten uit als de Bank voorafgaand aan de verdeling uitoefende.

Op het tijdstip waarop deze Overeenkomst namens haar ondertekend wordt, maakt iedere regering aan de regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika eenhonderdste van een percent van de prijs van elk aandeel in goud of in Amerikaanse dollar over teneinde tegemoet te komen in de administratieve uitgaven van de Bank. Deze betaling wordt als voorschot op de overeenkomstig artikel II, sectie 8, onderdeel a, te verrichten betaling in mindering gebracht.

Indien de deponering van de akte door een dergelijke regering echter niet voor afloop van deze termijn plaatsvindt, wordt de door deze regering geplaatste handtekening nietig en wordt het deel van haar bijdrage, dat ingevolge d hierboven betaald is, teruggestort.  

i. De bepalingen van de paragrafen d en h worden voor iedere ondertekenende regering bindend op de datum van ondertekening.   
###SECTIE 3 INSTALLATIE VAN DE BANK

### Schema  B  

####Verkiezing van Bewindvoerders

1. De verkiezing van de te kiezen bewindvoerders vindt plaats bij stemming van de bestuurders, die krachtens artikel V, sectie 4, onderdeel b, het recht hebben om te stemmen.  

2. Bij het kiezen van de te kiezen bewindvoerders brengt iedere stemgerechtigde bestuurder alle stemmen waarop het hem benoemende lid recht heeft ingevolge sectie 3 van artikel V, uit op een persoon. De zeven personen die het grootste aantal stemmen ontvangen, worden bewindvoerders met dien verstande dat een persoon die minder dan veertien percent van het totaal aantal stemmen dat uitgebracht kan worden (gerechtigde stemmen) ontvangt, niet als gekozen beschouwd wordt.  

3. Wanneer bij de eerste stemming geen zeven personen gekozen worden, vindt een tweede stemming plaats, waarbij de persoon die het kleinste aantal stemmen ontvangen heeft, niet meer voor verkiezing in aanmerking komt en waarbij slechts stemmen a. de bestuurders die bij de eerste stemming op een niet-gekozen persoon stemden en b. de bestuurders wier stemmen voor een gekozen persoon ingevolge 4 hieronder geacht worden het aantal op die persoon uitgebrachte stemmen boven vijftien percent van de gerechtigde stemmen gebracht te hebben.  

4. Bij het vaststellen of de stemmen die door een bestuurder uitgebracht zijn geacht moeten worden het totaal voor een persoon boven vijftien percent van de gerechtigde stemmen gebracht te hebben, worden geacht de vijftien percent te bevatten, ten eerste de stemmen van de bestuurder die het grootste aantal stemmen op die persoon uitgebracht heeft, vervolgens de stemmen van de bestuurder die het op een na grootste aantal uitgebracht heeft en zo voorts, totdat vijftien percent bereikt is.  

5. Iedere bestuurder van wie een gedeelte van de stemmen in aanmerking genomen moet worden om het totaal op een persoon uitgebracht, boven veertien percent te brengen, wordt geacht al zijn stemmen op die persoon uit te brengen, zelfs indien het totaal aantal stemmen voor die persoon daardoor de vijftien percent overschrijdt.  

6. Indien na de tweede stemming geen zeven personen gekozen zijn, worden op basis van dezelfde beginselen verdere stemmingen gehouden totdat zeven personen gekozen zijn, op voorwaarde dat zodra zes personen gekozen zijn, de zevende bij een eenvoudige meerderheid van de overgebleven stemmen gekozen kan worden en beschouwd wordt met al die stemmen gekozen te zijn.
