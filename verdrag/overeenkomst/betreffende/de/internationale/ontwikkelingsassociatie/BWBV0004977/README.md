####Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association

The Governments on whose behalf this Agreement is signed, Considering: That mutual cooperation for constructive economic purposes, healthy development of the world economy and balanced growth of international trade foster international relationships conducive to the maintenance of peace and world prosperity; That an acceleration of economic development which will promote higher standards of living and economic and social progress in the less-developed countries is desirable not only in the interests of those countries but also in the interests of the international community as a whole; That achievement of these objectives would be facilitated by an increase in the international flow of capital, public and private, to assist in the development of the resources of the less-developed countries,   do hereby agree as follows:    

####Introductory Article

The International Development Association (hereinafter called “the Association”) is established and shall operate in accordance with the following provisions:  

### Article  I  

####Purposes

The purposes of the Association are to promote economic development, increase productivity and thus raise standards of living in the less-developed areas of the world included within the Association's membership, in particular by providing finance to meet their important developmental requirements on terms which are more flexible and bear less heavily on the balance of payments than those of conventional loans, thereby furthering the developmental objectives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter called “the Bank”) and supplementing its activities. The Association shall be guided in all decisions by the provisions of this Article.

(d) The remaining ninety percent of the initial subscription of each original member shall be payable in gold or freely convertible currency in the case of members listed in Part I of Schedule A, and in the currency of the subscribing member in the case of members listed in Part II of Schedule A. This ninety percent portion of initial subscriptions of original members shall be payable in five equal annual instalments as follows: the first such instalment within thirty days after the date on which the Association shall begin operations pursuant to Article XI, Section 4, or on the date on which the original member becomes a member, whichever shall be later; the second instalment one year after the beginning of operations of the Association, and succeeding instalments each year thereafter at annual intervals until the ninety percent portion of the initial subscription shall have been paid in full.  

(e) The Association shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the member's currency paid in or payable by the member under the preceding subsection (d) or under Section 2 of Article IV and not needed by the Association in its operations, notes or similar obligations issued by the government of the member or the depository designated by such member, which shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable at their par value on demand to the account of the Association in the designated depository.  

(f) For the purposes of this Agreement the Association shall regard as “freely convertible currency”:

(ii) currency of a member which such member agrees, on terms satisfactory to the Association, to exchange for the currencies of other members for the purposes of the Association's operations.    

(g) Except as the Association may otherwise agree, each member listed in Part I of Schedule A shall maintain, in respect of its currency paid in by it as freely convertible currency pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, the same convertibility as existed at the time of payment.  

(h) The conditions on which the initial subscriptions of members other than original members may be made, and the amounts and the terms of payment thereof, shall be determined by the Association pursuant to Section 1 (b) of this Article.

The arrangements under which any such resources are received may include provisions regarding the disposition of earnings on the resources and regarding the disposition of the resources in the event that the member providing them ceases to be a member or the Association permanently suspends its operations.  

(b) The Association shall deliver to the contributing member a Special Development Certificate setting forth the amount and currency of the resources so contributed and the terms and conditions of the arrangement relating to such resources.

(e) The Association shall take appropriate steps to ensure that, over reasonable intervals of time, the portions of the subscriptions paid under Article II, Section 2(d) by members listed in Part I of Schedule A shall be used by the Association on an approximately *pro rata* basis, provided, however, that such portions of such subscriptions as are paid in gold or in a currency other than that of the subscribing member may be used more rapidly.   
###Section 2

### *Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings* 

(a) Whenever the par value of a member's currency is reduced or the foreign exchange value of a member's currency has, in the opinion of the Association, depreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, the member shall pay to the Association within a reasonable time an additional amount of its own currency sufficient to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of the currency of such member paid in to the Association by the member under Article II, Section 2(d), and currency furnished under the provisions of the present paragraph, whether or not such currency is held in the form of notes accepted pursuant to Article II, Section 2(e), provided, however, that the foregoing shall apply only so long as and to the extent that such currency shall not have been initially disbursed or exchanged for the currency of another member.  

(b) Whenever the par value of a member's currency is increased, or the foreign exchange value of a member's currency has, in the opinion of the Association, appreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, the Association shall return to such member within a reasonable time an amount of that member's currency equal to the increase in the value of the amount of such currency to which the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section are applicable.  

(c) The provisions of the preceding paragraphs may be waived by the Association when a uniform proportionate change in the par value of the currencies of all its members is made by the International Monetary Fund.

(i) The government shall be relieved of any further liability to the Association on account of its subscription, except that the government shall pay to the Association forthwith amounts due and unpaid on the date when the government ceased to be a member and which in the opinion of the Association are needed by it to meet its commitments as of that date under its financing operations.

(iv) Any amount due to the government on account of its subscription may be withheld so long as that government, or the government of any territory included within its membership, or any political subdivision or any agency of any of the foregoing remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Association, and such amount may, at the option of the Association, be applied against any such liability as it matures.  

(v) In no event shall the government receive under this paragraph (c) an amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the lesser of the two following: (a) the amount paid by the government on account of its subscription, or (b) such proportion of the net assets of the Association, as shown on the books of the Association as of the date on which the government ceased to be a member, as the amount of its subscription shall bear to the aggregate amount of the subscriptions of all members.

Until final settlement of such obligations and distribution of such assets, the Association shall remain in existence and all mutual rights and obligations of the Association and its members under this Agreement shall continue unimpaired, except that no member shall be suspended or shall withdraw and that no distribution shall be made to members except as in this Section provided.

####Overeenkomst betreffende de Internationale Ontwikkelingsassociatie

De Regeringen namens welke deze Overeenkomst is ondertekend, Overwegende: Dat onderlinge samenwerking voor constructieve economische doeleinden, een gezonde ontwikkeling van de wereldeconomie en een evenwichtige groei van de internationale handel bevorderlijk zijn voor internationale betrekkingen die bijdragen tot het handhaven van de vrede en de welvaart der wereld; Dat een versnelling der economische ontwikkeling die een hogere levensstandaard en economische en sociale vooruitgang in de minderontwikkelde landen bevordert, niet alleen wenselijk is in het belang van deze landen doch tevens in het belang van de internationale gemeenschap als geheel; Dat de verwezenlijking van deze doeleinden vergemakkelijkt zou worden door een toeneming van de internationale kapitaalstroom, zowel uit openbare als uit particuliere bron, ter ondersteuning van de ontwikkeling van de hulpbronnen in de minderontwikkelde landen,   komen als volgt overeen:    

####Inleidend artikel

De Internationale Ontwikkelingsassociatie (hierna genoemd „de Associatie”) is opgericht en oefent haar werkzaamheden uit overeenkomstig de volgende bepalingen:  

### Artikel  I  

####Doelstellingen

De Associatie heeft tot doel in de minderontwikkelde gebieden van de wereld waar deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is, de economische ontwikkeling te bevorderen en de produktiviteit te verhogen om er op die wijze de levensstandaard te verhogen in het bijzonder door het verstrekken van financiële middelen voor hun belangrijke ontwikkelingsbehoeften op voorwaarden die soepeler zijn en minder zwaar op de betalingsbalans drukken dan die van gebruikelijke leningen, en aldus de ontwikkelingsdoeleinden van de Internationale Bank voor Herstel en Ontwikkeling (hierna genoemd „de Bank”) te bevorderen en haar werkzaamheden aan te vullen. De Associatie laat zich in al haar beslissingen leiden door de bepalingen van dit artikel.  

### Artikel  II  

####Lidmaatschap; eerste bijdragen

###Afdeling 1

### *Lidmaatschap* 

a) De oorspronkelijke leden van de Associatie zijn die in Tabel A vermelde leden van de Bank die op of voor de in artikel XI, afdeling 2c), genoemde datum het lidmaatschap van de Associatie aanvaarden.  

b) Het lidmaatschap staat voor de andere leden van de Bank open op door de Associatie te bepalen tijdstippen en voorwaarden.   
###Afdeling 2

### *Eerste bijdragen* 

a) Bij aanvaarding van het lidmaatschap schrijft elk lid in voor een bijdrage ten belope van het voor hem vastgestelde bedrag. Deze bijdragen worden in deze Overeenkomst aangeduid als eerste bijdragen.  

b) De voor ieder oorspronkelijk lid vastgestelde eerste bijdrage beloopt het in Tabel A achter zijn naam vermelde bedrag, uitgedrukt in dollars van de Verenigde Staten van het op 1 januari 1960 geldende gewicht en gehalte.  

c) Een tiende van de eerste bijdrage van ieder oorspronkelijk lid dient als volgt in goud of vrij inwisselbare valuta te worden betaald: vijftig procent binnen dertig dagen na de datum waarop de Associatie haar werkzaamheden ingevolge artikel XI, afdeling 4, aanvangt, of, in het geval van een oorspronkelijk lid dat eerst na dat tijdstip lid wordt, op de datum waarop het het lidmaatschap aanvaardt; twaalf en een half procent een jaar na de aanvang der werkzaamheden van de Associatie; en daarna jaarlijks twaalf en een half procent met tussenpozen van een jaar totdat het tiende deel van de eerste bijdrage volledig betaald is.  

d) De overige negen tienden van de eerste bijdrage van ieder oorspronkelijk lid dienen in het geval van leden, vermeld in deel I van Tabel A, in goud of vrij inwisselbare valuta, en in het geval van leden, vermeld in deel II van Tabel A, in de valuta van het inschrijvende lid te worden betaald. Dit negen tiende deel van de eerste bijdragen van oorspronkelijke leden dient in vijf gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen te worden betaald en wel als volgt: de eerste termijn binnen dertig dagen na de datum waarop de Associatie haar werkzaamheden ingevolge artikel XI, afdeling 4, aanvangt, of, in het geval van een oorspronkelijk lid dat eerst na dat tijdstip lid wordt, op de datum waarop het het lidmaatschap aanvaardt; de tweede termijn een jaar na de aanvang der werkzaamheden van de Associatie, en de daaropvolgende termijnen jaarlijks daarna met tussenpozen van een jaar totdat het negen tiende deel van de eerste bijdrage volledig betaald is.  

e) Voor zover de Associatie de krachtens de voorgaande paragraaf d) of afdeling 2 van artikel IV door een lid betaalde valuta van dat lid niet voor haar werkzaamheden behoeft, neemt zij in plaats daarvan promessen of soortgelijke schuldbekentenissen aan die door de regering van dat lid of door een door dat lid aangewezen bewaarinstelling zijn uitgegeven. Deze schuldbekentenissen dragen geen rente, zijn niet verhandelbaar en zijn op zicht a pari betaalbaar ten gunste van de bij de aangewezen bewaarinstelling gehouden rekening der Associatie.  

f) Voor de doeleinden van deze Overeenkomst beschouwt de Associatie als „vrij inwisselbare valuta”: 

i) de valuta van een lid waarvan de inwisselbaarheid in de valuta's van andere leden, naar het na overleg met het Internationale Monetaire Fonds gevormde oordeel van de Associatie, voor haar werkzaamheden toereikend is; of  

ii) de valuta van een lid, welke dat lid op voor de Associatie bevredigende voorwaarden bereid is voor de werkzaamheden der Associatie in de valuta's van andere leden om te wisselen.    

g) Behoudens door de Associatie goed te keuren uitzonderingen, is ieder in deel I van Tabel A vermeld lid verplicht ten opzichte van zijn valuta die het ingevolge paragraaf d) van deze afdeling als vrij inwisselbare valuta betaald heeft, dezelfde inwisselbaarheid te handhaven als die welke ten tijde der betaling gold.  

h) De voorwaarden waarop leden die geen oorspronkelijke leden zijn, mogen inschrijven voor hun eerste bijdragen, de bedragen der bijdragen en de betalingsvoorwaarden voor deze bijdragen, worden door de Associatie ingevolge afdeling 1b) van dit artikel vastgesteld.   
###Afdeling 3

### *Beperking van aansprakelijkheid* 

Geen lid is uit hoofde van zijn lidmaatschap voor de verbintenissen der Associatie aansprakelijk.  

### Artikel  III  

####Aanvulling der middelen

###Afdeling 1

*Aanvullende bijdragen*  

a) Wanneer de Associatie, gezien het schema voor de voltooiing der betalingen op de eerste bijdragen van oorspronkelijke leden, zulks passend acht, en daarna met tussenpozen van omstreeks vijf jaar, neemt zij de toereikendheid van haar middelen opnieuw in ogenschouw en, zo zij zulks wenselijk acht, hecht zij haar goedkeuring aan een algemene verhoging van de bijdragen. Niettegenstaande het voorafgaande kunnen algemene of individuele verhogingen van bijdragen te allen tijde worden goedgekeurd, met dien verstande dat een individuele verhoging slechts op verzoek van het betrokken lid in overweging zal worden genomen. Bijdragen ingevolge deze afdeling worden in deze Overeenkomst als aanvullende bijdragen aangeduid.  

b) Wanneer aanvullende bijdragen worden goedgekeurd, stelt de Associatie de bedragen en de voorwaarden dezer bijdragen vast, zulks echter met inachtneming van de bepalingen van paragraaf c).  

c) Bij goedkeuring van een aanvullende bijdrage wordt ieder lid de mogelijkheid geboden op door de Associatie in redelijkheid vast te stellen voorwaarden in te schrijven voor een bedrag dat het lid in staat zal stellen zijn relatieve stemmensterkte te handhaven, maar geen lid is verplicht in te schrijven.  

d) Alle beslissingen krachtens deze afdeling vereisen een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen.   
###Afdeling 2

### *Verstrekking van aanvullende middelen door een lid in de valuta van een ander lid* 

a) De Associatie kan, op voorwaarden die verenigbaar zijn met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, regelingen treffen om van een lid, behalve bedragen die het lid ter zake van zijn eerste bijdrage of aanvullende bijdragen dient te betalen, aanvullende middelen in de valuta van een ander lid te ontvangen, met dien verstande dat de Associatie hiertoe niet overgaat tenzij zij zich ervan heeft overtuigd dat het lid welks valuta in het geding is, met het gebruik van deze valuta als aanvullende middelen en met de voorwaarden voor dat gebruik instemt. De regelingen krachtens welke zulke middelen worden ontvangen kunnen bepalingen inhouden betreffende de beschikking over inkomsten uit de middelen en betreffende de beschikking over de middelen voor het geval dat het lid dat de middelen heeft verstrekt ophoudt lid te zijn of de Associatie voorgoed haar werkzaamheden staakt.  

b) De Associatie geeft aan het lid dat de middelen verstrekt een Bijzonder Ontwikkelingscertificaat. Dit certificaat vermeldt het bedrag en de valuta van de verstrekte middelen en de voorwaarden waarop zij zijn verstrekt. Aan een Bijzonder Ontwikkelingscertificaat is geen stemrecht verbonden en het certificaat kan alleen aan de Associatie worden overgedragen.  

c) De bepalingen van deze afdeling verzetten zich er niet tegen dat de Associatie van een lid middelen in zijn eigen valuta aanneemt op zodanige voorwaarden als de partijen overeenkomen.    

### Artikel  IV  

####Valuta's

###Afdeling 1

### *Gebruik van valuta's* 

a) De al dan niet vrij inwisselbare valuta van een in deel II van Tabel A vermeld lid, die door de Associatie ingevolge artikel II, afdeling 2d), is ontvangen ter betaling van het negen tiende deel dat krachtens die bepaling in de valuta van dat lid dient te worden betaald, en de daaruit als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten voortgekomen valuta van dat lid, kan door de Associatie worden gebruikt voor door haar gemaakte administratieve onkosten in de gebiedsdelen van dat lid en, voorzover niet in strijd met een gezonde monetaire politiek, ter betaling van in de gebiedsdelen van dat lid voortgebrachte goederen en verleende diensten, die nodig zijn voor door de Associatie gefinancierde projecten welke in die gebiedsdelen zijn gelegen. Bovendien zal, wanneer en voorzover het betrokken lid en de Associatie overeenkomen dat de economische en financiële toestand van het lid zulks rechtvaardigt, zulke valuta vrij inwisselbaar zijn of op andere wijze kunnen worden gebruikt voor door de Associatie gefinancierde projecten die buiten de gebiedsdelen van het lid zijn gelegen.  

b) Het gebruik van valuta's die door de Associatie zijn ontvangen ter betaling van bijdragen, waaronder niet begrepen eerste bijdragen van oorspronkelijke leden, en van valuta's die daaruit als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten zijn voortgekomen, wordt bepaald door de voorwaarden die ten tijde van de goedkeuring dezer bijdragen daaraan zijn verbonden.  

c) Het gebruik van valuta's die door de Associatie zijn ontvangen als aanvullende middelen, waaronder niet begrepen bijdragen, en van valuta's die daaruit als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten zijn voortgekomen, wordt bepaald door de voorwaarden ingevolge welke zulke valuta's zijn ontvangen.  

d) Alle andere door de Associatie ontvangen valuta's kunnen door de Associatie vrijelijk worden gebruikt en omgewisseld en zijn niet onderworpen aan enige beperking door het lid welks valuta gebruikt of omgewisseld wordt. Het voorgaande sluit echter niet uit dat de Associatie met het lid in welks gebiedsdelen een door de Associatie gefinancierd project is gelegen een regeling treft waarbij het gebruik door de Associatie van de als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten in verband met deze financiering ontvangen valuta van dat lid wordt beperkt.  

e) De Associatie treft passende maatregelen ter verzekering van een ten naaste bij evenredig gebruik door de Associatie over een redelijk verloop van tijd, van de door de in deel I van Tabel A vermelde leden krachtens artikel II, afdeling 2d), betaalde gedeelten hunner bijdragen, met dien verstande echter dat die gedeelten van deze bijdragen die in goud of in de valuta van een ander dan het inschrijvende lid zijn betaald, sneller kunnen worden gebruikt.   
###Afdeling 2

### *Handhaving van de waarde van valutabezit* 

a) Wanneer de pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid wordt verlaagd of de koerswaarde van de valuta van een lid, naar de mening van de Associatie, binnen de gebiedsdelen van dat lid in aanmerkelijke mate gedaald is, is het lid verplicht binnen een redelijke termijn aan de Associatie een zodanig aanvullend bedrag van zijn eigen valuta te betalen als nodig is om de waarde te handhaven, berekend naar het tijdstip van inschrijving, van het bedrag aan valuta van dat lid dat door het lid aan de Associatie is betaald krachtens artikel II, afdeling 2d), alsmede van de valuta die betaald mocht zijn krachtens de bepalingen van deze paragraaf, ongeacht of zulke valuta aangehouden wordt in de vorm van ingevolge artikel II, afdeling 2e), ontvangen promessen, met dien verstande echter dat het voorgaande alleen van toepassing is totdat en voor zover zulke valuta voor de eerste maal uitbetaald of in de valuta van een ander lid omgewisseld is.  

b) Wanneer de pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid wordt verhoogd of de koerswaarde van de valuta van een lid, naar de mening van de Associatie, binnen de gebiedsdelen van dat lid in aanmerkelijke mate is gestegen, wordt aan een dergelijk lid door de Associatie binnen een redelijke termijn een bedrag aan de valuta van dat lid teruggegeven, gelijk aan de waardevermeerdering van de bedragen aan die valuta waarop de bepalingen van paragraaf a) van deze afdeling toepasselijk zijn.  

c) De Associatie kan van de toepassing van de bepalingen van de voorgaande paragrafen van deze afdeling afzien, wanneer een eenvormige evenredige verandering in de pari-waarde van de valuta's van al haar leden door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds tot stand gebracht wordt.  

d) Bedragen die krachtens de bepalingen van paragraaf a) van deze afdeling worden verschaft ter handhaving van de waarde van een valuta, kunnen in dezelfde mate als die valuta worden ingewisseld en gebruikt.    

### Artikel  V  

####Werkzaamheden

###Afdeling 1

### *Gebruik van middelen en voorwaarden van financiering* 

a) De Associatie verstrekt geldmiddelen ter bevordering van de ontwikkeling in de minderontwikkelde gebieden van de wereld waar deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is.  

b) De door de Associatie verstrekte geldmiddelen dienen voor doeleinden die naar de mening van de Associatie, gezien de behoeften van het betrokken gebied of de betrokken gebieden, voor de ontwikkeling hoge voorrang verdienen; deze geldmiddelen dienen, behoudens bijzondere omstandigheden, voor nauwkeurig omschreven projecten te worden gebruikt.  

c) De Associatie verstrekt geen geldmiddelen indien naar haar mening zulke middelen van particuliere zijde op voor de ontvanger redelijke voorwaarden beschikbaar zijn of indien die middelen kunnen worden verschaft door middel van een lening van het type dat door de Bank wordt verstrekt.  

d) De Associatie verstrekt geen geldmiddelen dan op aanbeveling van een bevoegde commissie nadat deze het voorstel zorgvuldig heeft bestudeerd. Iedere zodanige commissie wordt door de Associatie benoemd en bestaat uit een persoon aangewezen door de Bestuurder of Bestuurders als vertegenwoordiger(s) van het lid of de leden in wiens of wier gebiedsdelen het desbetreffende project is gelegen en uit een of meer leden van het technische personeel van de Associatie. Het vereiste dat een door de Bestuurder of Bestuurders aangewezen persoon deel uitmaakt van de commissie is niet van toepassing wanneer geldmiddelen worden verstrekt aan een publiekrechtelijke internationale of regionale organisatie.  

e) De Associatie verstrekt geen geldmiddelen ter financiering van een project indien het lid in welks gebiedsdelen het project is gelegen tegen die financiering bezwaar maakt, met dien verstande dat indien geldmiddelen worden verstrekt aan een publiekrechtelijke internationale of regionale organisatie de Associatie zich er niet van behoeft te overtuigen dat individuele leden geen bezwaar maken.  

f) De Associatie stelt niet als voorwaarde dat door haar verstrekte geldmiddelen in de gebiedsdelen van een bepaald lid of bepaalde leden moeten worden besteed. Het voorgaande sluit niet uit dat de Associatie zich houdt aan beperkingen op het gebruik van fondsen, opgelegd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, daaronder begrepen beperkingen ten aanzien van aanvullende middelen ingevolge een overeenkomst tussen de Associatie en de gever.  

g) De Associatie treft maatregelen om te verzekeren dat verstrekte geldmiddelen alleen worden gebruikt voor de doeleinden waarvoor zij zijn verstrekt, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met overwegingen van zuinigheid, doelmatigheid en internationale handelsconcurrentie, onder uitsluiting van politieke of andere niet-economische invloeden of overwegingen.  

h) Gelden die onder een financieringstransactie worden verstrekt, worden aan de ontvanger slechts beschikbaar gesteld voor de bestrijding van de werkelijke kosten die in verband met het project worden gemaakt.   
###Afdeling 2

### *Financieringsvorm en -voorwaarden* 

a) Financiering door de Associatie vindt plaats bij wege van leningen. De Associatie mag echter andere vormen van financiering verstrekken, hetzij 

i) uit middelen bijgedragen ingevolge artikel III, afdeling 1, en daaruit als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten voortgekomen middelen, mits de goedkeuring voor zulke bijdragen uitdrukkelijk in een zodanige financiering voorziet; hetzij  

ii) in bijzondere omstandigheden, uit aanvullende middelen die aan de Associatie zijn verschaft en daaruit als hoofdsom, rente of andere kosten voortgekomen middelen, mits de regelingen krachtens welke zulke middelen zijn verschaft uitdrukkelijk in een zodanige financiering voorzien.    

b) Onder voorbehoud van de voorgaande paragraaf, kan de Associatie geldmiddelen verstrekken in zodanige vorm en op zodanige voorwaarden als zij, gezien de economische toestand en vooruitzichten van het betrokken gebied of de betrokken gebieden en de aard en de eisen van het project, dienstig acht.  

c) De Associatie kan geldmiddelen verstrekken aan een lid, aan de regering van een gebiedsdeel waar deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is, aan een staatkundig onderdeel van een lid of een zodanig gebiedsdeel, aan een publiek- of privaatrechtelijk lichaam in de gebiedsdelen van een lid of van leden, of aan een publiekrechtelijke internationale of regionale organisatie.  

d) Ingeval een lening niet aan het lid zelf wordt verstrekt, kan de Associatie, naar verkiezing, een passende garantie of garanties van een regering of anderen verlangen.  

e) In bijzondere gevallen kan de Associatie buitenlandse valuta voor plaatselijke kosten beschikbaar stellen.   
###Afdeling 3

### *Wijziging van financieringsvoorwaarden* 

Indien en voor zover de Associatie, gelet op alle ter zake dienende omstandigheden, daaronder begrepen de financiële en economische toestand en vooruitzichten van het betrokken lid, daartoe aanleiding ziet, kan zij op door haar te bepalen voorwaarden toestemmen in een matiging of andere wijziging van de voorwaarden waarop door haar geldmiddelen voor financieringsdoeleinden zijn verstrekt. 
###Afdeling 4

### *Samenwerking met andere internationale instellingen en leden die hulp voor ontwikkelingsdoeleinden verstrekken* 

De Associatie werkt samen met die publiekrechtelijke internationale organisaties en leden die financiële en technische bijstand aan de minderontwikkelde gebieden der wereld verlenen. 
###Afdeling 5

### *Diverse werkzaamheden* 

Behalve de elders in deze Overeenkomst vermelde werkzaamheden, kan de Associatie: 

i) geldleningen aangaan met de toestemming van het lid in welks valuta de lening is uitgedrukt;

###Afdeling 3

###Afdeling 4

### *Rechten en verplichtingen van regeringen die ophouden lid te zijn* 

a) Indien een regering ophoudt lid te zijn heeft zij geen rechten krachtens deze Overeenkomst met uitzondering van die vervat in deze afdeling en in artikel X c), maar zij blijft voor zover in deze afdeling niet anders wordt bepaald, aansprakelijk voor alle door haar tegenover de Associatie als lid, debiteur, garant of anderszins aangegane financiële verplichtingen.  

b) Indien een regering ophoudt lid te zijn gaan de Associatie en de regering tot een vereffening van hun financiële betrekkingen over. Als onderdeel van deze vereffening kunnen de Associatie en de regering een regeling treffen inzake de aan de regering te betalen bedragen ter zake van haar bijdrage en inzake het tijdstip waarop en de valuta's waarin de betaling zal geschieden. In dit artikel wordt met betrekking tot de regering van een lid de term „bijdrage” geacht zowel de eerste als ook aanvullende bijdragen van die regering te omvatten.  

c) Indien binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop de regering ophoudt lid te zijn of op een ander door de Associatie en de regering overeen te komen tijdstip geen regeling tot stand is gekomen, gelden de volgende bepalingen: 

i) De regering wordt ontslagen van alle verdere aansprakelijkheid tegenover de Associatie terzake van haar bijdrage, behalve dat zij verplicht is aan de Associatie onmiddellijk alle door haar verschuldigde en op de datum waarop zij ophield lid te zijn nog onbetaalde bedragen te betalen, welke naar de mening van de Associatie door haar benodigd zijn om haar op die datum bestaande, in het kader van haar financieringswerkzaamheden gedane, toezeggingen gestand te kunnen doen.  

ii) De Associatie betaalt aan de regering de door haar terzake van haar bijdrage betaalde gelden terug of de daaruit als terugbetaalde hoofdsommen voortgekomen gelden die zich in het bezit van de Associatie bevinden op de datum waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn, voorzover deze gelden naar de mening van de Associatie door haar niet benodigd zijn om haar op die datum bestaande, in het kader van haar financieringswerkzaamheden gedane, toezeggingen gestand te kunnen doen.  

iii) De Associatie betaalt aan de regering een evenredig deel van alle terugbetaalde hoofdsommen die door de Associatie ontvangen zijn na de datum waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn, uit hoofde van voor die datum verstrekte leningen, met uitzondering van leningen verstrekt uit aanvullende middelen die aan de Associatie verschaft zijn krachtens regelingen welke bijzondere afwikkelingsrechten voorschrijven. Dit aandeel bedraagt een deel van de totale hoofdsom dezer leningen, dat bepaald wordt door de verhouding tussen het totale door de regering ter zake van haar bijdrage betaalde, en aan haar niet ingevolge de bovenvermelde paragraaf ii) teruggestorte, bedrag, en het totale door alle leden ter zake van hun bijdragen betaalde bedrag, dat gebruikt is of naar de mening van de Associatie door haar benodigd zal zijn teneinde haar op de datum waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn bestaande, in het kader van haar financieringswerkzaamheden gedane, toezeggingen gestand te kunnen doen. Deze betaling door de Associatie geschiedt in termijnen naarmate de terugbetaalde hoofdsommen door haar ontvangen worden maar niet meer dan één keer per jaar. Deze termijnen worden betaald in de door de Associatie ontvangen valuta's, maar de Associatie kan naar verkiezing in de valuta van de betrokken regering betalen.  

iv) Een bedrag dat aan een regering ter zake van haar bijdrage is verschuldigd kan ingehouden worden zo lang die regering, of de regering van een gebiedsdeel waar deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is of enig staatkundig onderdeel of enige instelling van een hunner als debiteur of garant jegens de Associatie aansprakelijk blijft, en dit bedrag kan naar verkiezing van de Associatie verrekend worden met een dergelijke verplichting wanneer deze opeisbaar wordt.  

v) In geen geval is een regering krachtens deze paragraaf c) gerechtigd in totaal meer te ontvangen dan het kleinste van de twee volgende bedragen: a) het bedrag door de regering ter zake van haar bijdrage betaald, of b) een deel van het volgens de boeken van de Associatie berekende zuivere vermogen van de Associatie op de dag waarop de regering ophield lid te zijn, te bepalen door de verhouding tussen de bijdrage van de regering en het totale bedrag van de bijdragen van alle leden.  

vi) Alle krachtens deze paragraaf te maken berekeningen geschieden op een door de Associatie in redelijkheid te bepalen grondslag.    

d) In geen geval wordt enig aan een regering krachtens deze afdeling verschuldigd bedrag eerder uitbetaald dan zes maanden na de datum waarop zij ophield lid te zijn. Indien de Associatie binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop een regering ophoudt lid te zijn haar werkzaamheden overeenkomstig afdeling 5 van dit artikel opschort, worden alle rechten van die regering door de bepalingen van afdeling 5 bepaald en wordt zij voor de toepassing van afdeling 5 als lid van de Associatie beschouwd, met dien verstande dat zij geen stemrecht heeft.   
###Afdeling 5

### *Opschorting van werkzaamheden en vereffening van verplichtingen* 

a) De Associatie kan bij besluit van de meerderheid van de Bestuurders die de meerderheid van het totale stemrecht uitoefenen, voorgoed haar werkzaamheden opschorten. Na een dergelijk besluit staakt de Associatie onmiddellijk alle werkzaamheden, behalve die welke verband houden met het ordelijk te gelde maken, in stand houden en beschermen van haar activa en de vereffening van haar verplichtingen. Tot het tijdstip van de uiteindelijke vereffening van die verplichtingen en de uitkering van die activa blijft de Associatie voortbestaan en blijven alle wederzijdse rechten en verplichtingen van de Associatie en haar leden ingevolge deze Overeenkomst onverminderd van kracht, met dien verstande dat geen lid wordt geschorst of zijn lidmaatschap kan opzeggen en dat geen uitkering aan de leden wordt gedaan, behalve die welke in deze afdeling zijn geregeld.  

b) Geen uitkering wordt aan de leden gedaan ter zake van hun bijdragen voordat alle verplichtingen aan crediteuren zijn voldaan of voorzieningen daartoe zijn getroffen en voordat een meerderheid van de bestuurders die een meerderheid van het totale stemrecht uitoefenen, besloten heeft tot een zodanige uitkering over te gaan.  

c) Met inachtneming van het voorgaande, en van bijzondere regelingen getroffen ter zake van de beschikking over aanvullende middelen in verband met de verstrekking daarvan aan de Associatie, keert de Associatie haar activa aan de leden pro rata uit, in verhouding tot de door hen ter zake van hun bijdragen betaalde bedragen. Iedere uitkering aan een lid ingevolge de voorafgaande bepalingen van deze paragraaf c) vindt slechts plaats na een voorafgaande vereffening van alle uitstaande vorderingen van de Associatie op het lid. Een zodanige uitkering wordt verricht op zodanige tijdstippen, in zodanige valuta's en hetzij in contanten, hetzij in andere activa, op de wijze als de Associatie billijk en redelijk oordeelt. De uitkering behoeft wat betreft de aard van de uitgekeerde vermogensbestanddelen of de valuta's waarin zij zijn uitgedrukt niet voor alle leden gelijk te zijn.  

d) Ieder lid dat door de Associatie ingevolge deze afdeling of afdeling 4 verdeelde activa ontvangt, geniet ten aanzien daarvan dezelfde rechten als de Associatie voor hun verdeling genoot.
