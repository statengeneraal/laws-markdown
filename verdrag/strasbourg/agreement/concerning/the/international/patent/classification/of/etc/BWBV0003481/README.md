(4).  Op het tijdstip van ondertekening van deze Overeenkomst of van de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding 

(i) kan elk land verklaren, dat het zich niet verplicht de tekens betreffende de groepen of ondergroepen van de classificatie te vermelden in de aanvragen bedoeld in het derde lid die slechts voor het publiek ter inzage worden gelegd en in de daarop betrekking hebbende mededelingen;  

(ii) kan elk land, dat geen onderzoek, onmiddellijk dan wel uitgesteld, instelt naar de nieuwheid van uitvindingen, en waarvan de procedure voor de verlening van octrooien of andere vormen van bescherming niet voorziet in een onderzoek naar de stand van de techniek, verklaren, dat het zich niet verplicht de tekens betreffende de groepen of ondergroepen van de classificatie te vermelden in de stukken en mededelingen bedoeld in het derde lid. Indien deze omstandigheden zich slechts voordoen ten aanzien van bepaalde categorieën van bescherming of bepaalde gebieden van de techniek, kan het betrokken land slechts van dit voorbehoud gebruik maken in de mate, waarin die omstandigheden zich voordoen.     
(5).  De tekens van de classificatie, voorafgegaan door de woorden „internationale classificatie van octrooien” of van een afkorting daarvan, vastgesteld door de in artikel 5 bedoelde Commissie van deskundigen, dienen in vette letters of op andere goed zichtbare wijze te worden gedrukt in het hoofd van elk stuk bedoeld in het derde lid, onder (i), waarin zij dienen te worden vermeld.   
(6).  Indien een land van de Bijzondere Unie de verlening van octrooien toevertrouwt aan een intergouvernementele instantie, neemt het alle maatregelen die in zijn vermogen liggen opdat deze instantie de classificatie overeenkomstig dit artikel toepast.

(c) Als gemeenschappelijke uitgaven der Unies worden beschouwd de uitgaven die niet uitsluitend ten laste van de Bijzondere Unie kunnen worden gebracht maar tevens van een of meer andere Unies, welke worden beheerd door de Organisatie. Het aandeel van de Bijzondere Unie in deze gemeenschappelijke uitgaven is evenredig aan het belang, dat deze uitgaven voor haar vertegenwoordigen.     
(2).  De begroting van de Bijzondere Unie wordt vastgesteld met inachtneming van de vereisten tot coördinatie met de begrotingen van de andere door de Organisatie beheerde Unies.   
(3).  De begroting van de Bijzondere Unie wordt gefinancierd uit de volgende bronnen van inkomsten: 

(i) de bijdragen van de landen van de Bijzondere Unie;  

(ii) de taksen en andere gelden verschuldigd voor de diensten verleend door het Internationale Bureau namens de Bijzondere Unie;  

(iii) de opbrengst van de verkoop van de publikaties van het Internationale Bureau betreffende de Bijzondere Unie en de rechten welke op deze publikaties betrekking hebben;

(a) Ter vaststelling van zijn bijdrage in de zin van het derde lid, onder (i), behoort elk land van de Bijzondere Unie tot de klasse waarin het is ondergebracht ter zake van de Unie van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom en betaalt het zijn jaarlijkse bijdrage op basis van het voor die klasse in die Unie vastgestelde aantal eenheden.  

(b) De jaarlijkse bijdrage van elk land van de Bijzondere Unie wordt gevormd door een bedrag, waarvan de verhouding tot de som van de jaarlijkse bijdragen van alle landen aan de begroting van de Bijzondere Unie dezelfde is als de verhouding tussen het aantal eenheden van de klasse waarin het is ondergebracht, en het totale aantal eenheden van de landen gezamenlijk.  

(c) De bijdragen zijn ieder jaar op 1 januari verschuldigd.  

(d) Een land dat achterstallig is met de betaling van zijn bijdragen kan in geen der organen van de Bijzondere Unie zijn stemrecht uitoefenen, indien het bedrag van zijn achterstalligheid gelijk is aan of hoger is dan dat der bijdragen, verschuldigd over twee volledig verstreken jaren. Het kan dat land evenwel vergund worden de uitoefening van zijn stemrecht in het desbetreffende orgaan te behouden, zolang dit orgaan van oordeel is dat de achterstalligheid wordt veroorzaakt door uitzonderlijke en onvermijdelijke omstandigheden.  

(e) Ingeval een begroting niet is vastgesteld voor de aanvang van het nieuwe begrotingsjaar, wordt de begroting van het voorafgaande jaar aangehouden volgens de werkwijze voorzien in het financieel reglement.     
(5).  Het bedrag der taksen en der gelden verschuldigd voor door het Internationale Bureau namens de Bijzondere Unie verleende diensten wordt vastgesteld door de Directeur-Generaal, die daarover verslag uitbrengt aan de Algemene Vergadering.   
(6).  

(a) De Bijzondere Unie bezit een operationeel fonds, gevormd door een eenmalige storting van elk der landen van de Bijzondere Unie. Indien het fonds ontoereikend wordt, besluit de Algemene Vergadering tot bijstorting.  

(b) Het bedrag der eerste storting door ieder land in het hiervoor vermelde fonds of van zijn deelneming aan de bijstorting is evenredig aan de bijdrage van dat land voor het jaar waarin het fonds is gesticht of tot bijstorting is besloten.  

(c) Het aandeel en de wijze van storting worden vastgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering op voorstel van de Directeur-Generaal en na ingewonnen advies van de Coördinatiecommissie van de Organisatie.     
(7).  

(a) De zetelovereenkomst, gesloten met het land op welks grondgebied de Organisatie haar zetel heeft, bepaalt dat, indien het operationeel fonds niet toereikend is, dat land voorschotten verstrekt. Het bedrag van deze voorschotten en de voorwaarden waarop zij worden verstrekt, vormen telkenmale het onderwerp van afzonderlijke overeenkomsten tussen het betrokken land en de Organisatie.  

(b) Het land bedoeld onder (a) en de Organisatie hebben elk het recht de overeenkomst tot het verstrekken van voorschotten schriftelijk op te zeggen. De opzegging wordt van kracht drie jaar na afloop van het jaar waarin de kennisgeving is gedaan.     
(8).  Het nazien der rekeningen wordt verricht, op de wijze voorzien in het financieel reglement, door één of meer landen van de Bijzondere Unie of door onafhankelijke controleurs, die, met hun instemming, zijn aangewezen door de Algemene Vergadering.

(2).  De wijzigingen van de in het eerste lid genoemde artikelen worden door de Algemene Vergadering vastgesteld. Voor deze vaststelling is drie/ vierde van de uitgebrachte stemmen vereist. Voor een wijziging van artikel 7 en van dit lid is evenwel vier/vijfde van de uitgebrachte stemmen vereist.   
(3).

(b) Een aldus aanvaarde wijziging van de genoemde artikelen bindt alle landen die lid zijn van de Bijzondere Unie op het tijdstip waarop de wijziging van kracht wordt; wijzigingen die de financiële verplichtingen van de landen van de Bijzondere Unie verzwaren, binden evenwel slechts die landen, die te kennen hebben gegeven deze wijziging te aanvaarden.  

(c) Een overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder (a) aanvaarde wijziging bindt alle landen die lid van de Bijzondere Unie worden na de datum waarop de wijziging in werking is getreden overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder (a).
