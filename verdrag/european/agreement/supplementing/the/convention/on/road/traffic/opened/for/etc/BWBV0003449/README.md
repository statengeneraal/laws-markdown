De overeenkomst tussen de bevoegde administraties kan bepalen dat tijdens een overgangsperiode de vroegere bepalingen van de Bijlage geheel of gedeeltelijk van kracht zullen blijven naast de nieuwe bepalingen. De Secretaris-Generaal bepaalt de datum van inwerkingtreding van de nieuwe bepalingen.   
8.  Elke Staat deelt op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bekrachtiging van of van toetreding tot deze Overeenkomst de Secretaris-Generaal de naam en het adres mede van zijn ter zake van de Overeenkomst bevoegde administratie als bedoeld in het zevende lid van dit artikel.

Indien een van beide voertuigen die elkaar voorbij willen gaan genoodzaakt is achteruit te rijden om het voorbijgaan mogelijk te maken, hebben samenstellen van voertuigen recht van voorrang boven andere voertuigen, zware voertuigen boven lichte voertuigen en bussen boven vrachtauto's; wanneer beide voertuigen tot dezelfde categorie behoren, dient de bestuurder van het bergafwaarts rijdende voertuig achteruit te rijden, tenzij het voor de bestuurder van het bergopwaarts rijdende voertuig duidelijk gemakkelijker is zulks te doen, bijvoorbeeld, indien laatstgenoemde dicht bij een uitwijkhaven is”.

Deze bepaling is echter niet van toepassing bij zeer grote verkeersdichtheid, noch in omstandigheden waarin inhalen is verboden.”

– Bestuurders mogen een voertgangersoversteekplaats pas oprijden wanneer zij zich ervan verzekerd hebben dat zij daar niet op hoeven te stoppen.

Indien het passeren of inhalen wegens gebrek aan ruimte niet kan geschieden aan de zijde overeenkomstig de rijrichting, mogen deze manoeuvres worden uitgevoerd aan de zijde tegenover de zijde overeenkomstig de rijrichting, mits hierdoor geen hinder of gevaar wordt veroorzaakt voor tegemoetkomende weggebruikers. Op rijbanen met verkeer in één richting kunnen zich op rails voortbewegende voertuigen worden ingehaald aan de zijde tegenover die van de rijrichting, wanneer de eisen van het verkeer zulks rechtvaardigen.”

b. dienen ladingen die meer dan één meter buiten de achterzijde van het voertuig uitsteken, te worden aangegeven door middel van een vierkant of driehoekig bord, waarvan de zijden ten minste 40 cm lang zijn, dat zodanig aan de uiterste rand van de lading wordt bevestigd dat het voortdurend in een verticaal vlak haaks op het middellangsvlak van het voertuig staat, of door middel van een driedimensionale voorziening (pyramide-, prisma- of cilindervormig) die aan het uiteinde van de lading hangt en die een behoorlijk oppervlak of projectievlak heeft. Het bord moet zijn voorzien van rode en witte strepen en de driedimensionale voorziening rode en witte strepen of helder gekleurde zijden. De rode en witte gedeelten moeten worden voorzien van reflectoren of een reflecterende laag. Het hoogste punt van het oplichtende of reflecterende oppervlak van de genoemde voorziening mag niet hoger zijn geplaatst dan 1,60 m boven de grond. Het laagste punt mag niet lager zijn dan 0,40 m boven de grond;
