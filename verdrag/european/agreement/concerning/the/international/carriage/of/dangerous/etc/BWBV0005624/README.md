####Protocol van ondertekening bij de Europese Overeenkomst betreffende het internationale vervoer van gevaarlijke goederen over de weg (ADR)

Ten tijde van de ondertekening van de Europese Overeenkomst betreffende het internationale vervoer van gevaarlijke goederen over de weg (ADR), verrichten de ondergetekenden, behoorlijk gevolmachtigd, het volgende: 

1. Overwegende, dat de voorwaarden voor het vervoer over zee van gevaarlijke goederen, bestemd voor of afkomstig van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, wezenlijk verschillen van die welke zijn voorgeschreven in Bijlage A bij het ADR en dat het onmogelijk is de eerstgenoemde in de naaste toekomst zodanig te wijzigen, dat zij met de laatstgenoemde in overeenstemming worden gebracht, Rekening houdend met het feit, dat het Verenigd Koninkrijk op zich heeft genomen, bij wijze van wijziging van Bijlage A een bijzonder aanhangsel bij genoemde Bijlage aan te bieden, dat bijzondere voorschriften zal inhouden, welke van toepassing zullen zijn op het land/zeevervoer van gevaarlijke goederen tussen het Europese vasteland en het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Besluiten zij, dat tot de inwerkingtreding van dat bijzondere aanhangsel de gevaarlijke goederen welke onder het regime van het ADR worden vervoerd, bestemd voor of afkomstig van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, zullen moeten voldoen aan de bepalingen van Bijlage A bij het ADR en bovendien aan de voorschriften van het Verenigd Koninkrijk betreffende het vervoer over zee van gevaarlijke goederen;  

2. Nemen zij kennis van een verklaring van de vertegenwoordiger van Frankrijk, volgens welke de Regering van de Franse Republiek zich in afwijking van artikel 4, lid 2, het recht voorbehoudt te verbieden, dat voertuigen welke op het grondgebied van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in dienst zijn gesteld, ongeacht de datum waarop dit is geschied, op Frans grondgebied vervoer van gevaarlijke goederen verrichten, tenzij die voertuigen voldoen hetzij aan de voorwaarden, door Bijlage B voor dat vervoer gesteld, hetzij aan de voorwaarden welke door de Franse voorschriften inzake het vervoer van gevaarlijke goederen over de weg worden gesteld voor het vervoer van de goederen in kwestie;  

3. Bevelen zij aan, dat zo enigszins mogelijk voorstellen tot wijziging van deze Overeenkomst of van de Bijlagen, alvorens overeenkomstig artikel 14, lid 1, of artikel 13, lid 2, te worden ingediend, eerst worden besproken op bijeenkomsten van deskundigen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en zo nodig van de andere in artikel 6, lid 1, van de Overeenkomst bedoelde landen en van de in artikel 14, lid 5, van de Overeenkomst bedoelde internationale organisaties.
