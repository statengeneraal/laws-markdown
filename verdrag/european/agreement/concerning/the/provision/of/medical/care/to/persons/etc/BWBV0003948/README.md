The States signatory to this Agreement, Considering the pertinent clauses of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Recalling the recommendations of the European Regional Conferences of the International Labour Organisation on the development of co-operation in the field of social security, Bearing in mind the importance of the problems of social security requiring solutions in the light of the expansion of mutual links among those States and of the number of persons temporarily resident in the territory of a State other than the one whose legislation entitles them to medical care,   Have agreed on the following provisions:

(d) the term “competent authority” means the minister, ministers or other corresponding authority responsible for the application of the legislation of each Contracting Party in all or any part of the territory of that Party;

(f) the term “competent State” means the Contracting Party in whose territory the competent institution is situated;

### Article  2  

1.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be applicable to all persons who can claim medical care under the legislation of a Contracting Party or who would be able to claim such care under that legislation if they were in the territory of that Party.   
2.  However, if the legislation of a Contracting Party embraces several medical care systems, that Party may specify in Annex I the medical care systems covered by its legislation and to which this Agreement is applicable, in its relations with any other Contracting Party with whom it has agreed to apply the provisions of Article 6, paragraph 1, subparagraphs (b) or (c).   
3.  Each Contracting Party concerned shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18, paragraph 1, notify any amendment to Annex I.   

### Article  3  

1.  In the relations between Contracting Parties, this Agreement replaces the corresponding provisions of any social security convention, provided that such provisions, by mutual agreement between the Contracting Parties concerned, are mentioned in Annex II.   
2.  The Contracting Parties concerned, by mutual agreement, shall give notice, in respect of themselves, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18, paragraph 1, of any amendment to be made to Annex II.   

### Article  4  

1.  Persons covered by the provisions of this Agreement and whose condition, on medical advise, necessitates immediate medical care during temporary residence in the territory of a Contracting Party other than the competent State shall receive the medical care required by their condition, as if they were entitled to such care under the legislation of that Party. Such care shall be provided by the institution of the place of temporary residence in accordance with the provisions of the legislation applied by that institution, as if the persons concerned were covered by it, until their recovery or until their state of health permits them, on medical advice, to return or be repatriated to the territory of the Contracting Party where they reside, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.   
2.  However, in the relations between institutions which apply the provisions of Article 6, paragraph 1, subparagraph (b), the supply of prosthetic appliances, major aids and other major benefits in kind to be specified by mutual agreement by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned shall be conditional upon authorisation by the competent institution. However, such authorisation is not required in cases of absolute urgency.   
3.  If the condition of a person referred to in paragraph 1 does not permit him to return without help to the territory of the State where he resides, but nevertheless does not prevent his being moved, the institution of the place of temporary residence shall make the necessary arrangements for his repatriation to the territory of that State, in co-operation with the competent institution, provided that an agreement has been concluded for this purpose between the Contracting Parties concerned or their competent authorities.   
4.  Where the legislation applied by the institution of the place of temporary residence provides for several medical care schemes, the rules to be applied in respect of the provision of medical care by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 shall be those of the general scheme or, failing that, of the scheme for employed persons in industry.   
5.  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of this Agreement are not applicable to persons who go to the territory of a Contracting Party other than the competent State for the purpose of receiving medical care.   

### Article  5  

1.  In order to receive the medical care provided for in Article 4, paragraph 1, the person concerned shall submit proof of his entitlement to medical care under the legislation of a Contracting Party other than the one in whose territory he is present.   
2.  The proof referred to in paragraph 1 is given by means of a certificate delivered by the competent institution on a form agreed by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties.   
3.  Where the person concerned is entitled to medical care under the legislation of a Contracting Party which guarantees such entitlement to all nationals or all residents of that Party, the person concerned may be permitted to submit, instead of the certificate referred to in paragraph 2, his passport or another identity document recognised as equivalent if the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned have so decided by mutual agreement.   
4.  In cases of absolute urgency medical care shall not be withheld from the person concerned on the ground that he cannot submit at the appropriate time the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 or one of the documents referred to in paragraph 3. However, in such case, the institution of the place of temporary residence shall ask the competent institution to determine whether the person concerned is entitled to benefit from the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 2, the Contracting Parties which have agreed to apply the provisions of subparagraph (b) or subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 6 may resolve, through mutual agreement, difficulties arising from the application of the preceding sentence of this paragraph.   
5.  If the life or health of a person needing medical care are seriously in danger, or the person hospitalised is under 18 and away from his family, it would be desirable, in the interest of the person concerned, that the consular authority of the Contracting Party in whose territory that person is resident should be informed.   

### Article  6  

1.  The costs of medical care borne by the institution of the place of temporary residence by virtue of the provisions of Article 4: 

(a) shall not give rise to any refunds by the competent institution;  

(b) shall be refunded in full by the competent institution on the presentation of proof of the actual expenditure, excluding administrative costs;  

(c) shall be refunded by the competent institution, in accordance with special arrangements; depending on whether the Contracting Parties concerned have agreed to apply the provisions of subparagraph (a) or subparagraph (b) or subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.     
2.  In the relations between Contracting Parties which have agreed to apply the provisions of paragraph 1, subparagraph (b), the competent institution shall refund the actual amount of the costs of medical care borne by the institution of the place of temporary residence, by virtue of the provisions of Article 4, as shown in the accounts of that institution. The amount of the costs to be refunded may not exceed the actual amount for identical medical care that would have been provided to beneficiaries normally covered by the institution of the place of temporary residence.   
3.  In the relations between Contracting Parties which have agreed to apply the provisions of paragraph 1, subparagraph (c), the competent institution shall refund the amount of the costs/of medical care borne by the institution of the place of temporary residence, by virtue of the provisions of Article 4, in accordance with the specific arrangements reached between these Parties, notably on the basis of lump-sum payments determined by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned, from all the appropriate references drawn from the data available.   

### Article  7  

1.  Where, under this Agreement, the institution of one Contracting Party is liable to pay sums in refund of costs borne by the institution of another Contracting Party, its liability shall be expressed in currency of the second Party. The first institution may validly discharge its liability in that currency, unless the Contracting Parties concerned have agreed on other arrangements.   
2.  Transfers of funds which result from the application of this Agreement shall be effected, if such exist, in accordance with the relevant agreements in force between the Contracting Parties concerned at the date of transfer. Where no such arrangements exist, specific agreements should be concluded between the Parties concerned.

### Article  10  

Any claim or appeal that, under the legislation of a Contracting Party, should have been submitted within a specified time to an institution of that Party shall be admissible if it is submitted within the same period to a corresponding institution of another Contracting Party. In such event the institution receiving the claim or appeal shall forward it without delay to the institution of the First Parties competent to deal with it either directly or through the intermediary of the competent authorities of the Contracting Party concerned.

1.  De personen op wie de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn en die, in verband met hun gezondheidstoestand, op medisch advies onmiddellijk medische hulp nodig hebben tijdens hun verblijf op het grondgebied van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat, ontvangen de voor hun gezondheidstoestand vereiste medische hulp alsof zij hierop recht hadden krachtens de wetgeving van eerstbedoelde Partij. Deze hulp wordt verleend door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats volgens de bepalingen van de door dit orgaan toegepaste wetgeving alsof de belanghebbenden onder bedoeld orgaan ressorteerden, totdat zij zijn genezen of totdat hun gezondheidstoestand hen, volgens medisch advies, in staat stelt terug te keren of te worden gerepatrieerd naar het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij wonen, onder de voorwaarden bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel.   
2.  De verschaffing van prothesen, hulpmiddelen van grotere omvang en andere belangrijke verstrekkingen, die in gemeen overleg door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen moeten worden vastgesteld, is onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van het bevoegde orgaan in de betrekkingen tussen de organen die het bepaalde in artikel 6, eerste lid, letter b), toepassen. Deze goedkeuring is echter niet vereist in noodgevallen.   
3.  Indien de gezondheidstoestand van een persoon bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel niet zodanig is dat deze persoon op eigen gelegenheid kan terugkeren naar het grondgebied van de Staat waar deze woont, maar wel zodanig is dat deze mag worden vervoerd, neemt het orgaan van de verblijfplaats, in samenwerking met het bevoegde orgaan, de nodige maatregelen om te zorgen voor de repatriëring van deze persoon naar het grondgebied van bedoelde Staat, mits daartoe een overeenkomst is gesloten tussen de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of tussen hun bevoegde autoriteiten.   
4.  Indien de door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats toegepaste wetgeving verschillende stelsels van medische hulp omvat, zijn de bepalingen die van toepassing zijn op de verlening van medische hulp krachtens het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel, de bepalingen van het algemene stelsel, of, indien dit ontbreekt, van het stelsel waaronder de werknemers in de industrie ressorteren.   
5.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel, zijn de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst niet van toepassing op personen die zich begeven naar het grondgebied van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat met het doel medische hulp te ontvangen.   

### Artikel  5  

1.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor medische hulp krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 4, eerste lid, dient de belanghebbende het bewijs te leveren dat hij recht op medische hulp heeft krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan hij zich bevindt.   
2.  Het bewijs, bedoeld in het vorige lid van dit artikel, wordt geleverd door middel van een verklaring afgegeven door het bevoegde orgaan volgens een model overeengekomen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Wanneer de belanghebbende recht heeft op medische hulp krachtens de wetgeving van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een zodanig recht waarborgt aan alle staatsburgers of aan alle inwoners van die Partij, kan de belanghebbende worden toegestaan om, in plaats van de verklaring, bedoeld in het vorige lid van dit artikel, zijn paspoort of een ander als gelijkwaardig erkend identiteitsbewijs over te leggen indien de bevoegde autoriteiten van de desbetreffende Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zulks hebben besloten in gemeen overleg.   
4.  In noodgevallen mag medische hulp niet aan de belanghebbende worden geweigerd op grond van het feit dat hij niet in staat is om, op het daarvoor bestemde moment, de in het tweede lid bedoelde verklaring of één van de in het voorgaande lid van dit artikel bedoelde documenten over te leggen. In dat geval verzoekt het orgaan van de verblijfplaats evenwel het bevoegde orgaan vast te stellen of de belanghebbende recht op medische hulp kan doen gelden ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst. Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in het eerste lid van artikel 2, kunnen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die zijn overeengekomen het bepaalde in artikel 6, eerste lid, letter b) of c) toe te passen, in gemeen overleg de moeilijkheden regelen die voortvloeien uit de toepassing van de vorige zin van dit lid.   
5.  Indien het leven of de gezondheid van een persoon voor wie medische hulp is vereist, ernstig wordt bedreigd, of indien het een in een ziekenhuis opgenomen persoon betreft die jonger dan 18 jaar is en die van zijn familie is gescheiden, is het wenselijk om in het belang van deze persoon de consulaire autoriteit van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan deze persoon woont, te waarschuwen.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  De kosten van medische hulp die krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 4 zijn betaald door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats: 

a) worden niet terugbetaald door het bevoegde orgaan,  

b) worden, met uitzondering van de administratiekosten, geheel terugbetaald door het bevoegde orgaan tegen overlegging van de bewijsstukken inzake het werkelijk bedrag van de kosten,  

c) worden terugbetaald door het bevoegde orgaan overeenkomstig bijzondere regelingen,   al naar gelang de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn overeengekomen het bepaalde onder de letters a), b) of c) van dit lid toe te passen.   
2.  In de betrekkingen tussen Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die zijn overeengekomen het bepaalde onder letter b) van het vorige lid van dit artikel toe te passen, betaalt het bevoegde orgaan het werkelijke bedrag terug van de kosten van de medische hulp die door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 4 is betaald, zoals dit bedrag uit de boekhouding van laatstbedoeld orgaan blijkt. Het bedrag van de terug te betalen kosten mag niet hoger zijn dan het werkelijke bedrag van de kosten die betrekking hebben op soortgelijke medische hulp die zou zijn verleend aan rechthebbenden die op normale wijze onder het orgaan van de verblijfplaats vallen.   
3.  In de betrekkingen tussen Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die zijn overeengekomen het bepaalde onder letter c) van het eerste lid van dit artikel toe te passen, betaalt het bevoegde orgaan het bedrag van de kosten van de medische hulp die het orgaan van de verblijfplaats krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 4 heeft betaald, terug overeenkomstig tussen deze Partijen gesloten bijzondere regelingen met name op basis van vaste bedragen die in gemeen overleg tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van bedoelde Partijen zijn vastgesteld aan de hand van een passend referentiekader, ontleend aan de beschikbare gegevens.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  Wanneer het orgaan van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, krachtens deze Overeenkomst bedragen verschuldigd is voor de terugbetaling van kosten die zijn betaald door het orgaan van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, wordt het verschuldigde bedrag uitgedrukt in de munteenheid van de tweede Partij. Het eerstbedoelde orgaan kan het verschuldigde bedrag rechtsgeldig betalen in deze munteenheid tenzij de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen andere regelingen zijn overeengekomen.   
2.  De overmakingen die voortvloeien uit de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst geschieden, voorzover nodig, overeenkomstig de op het moment van de overmaking tussen de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op dit gebied van kracht zijnde regelingen.
