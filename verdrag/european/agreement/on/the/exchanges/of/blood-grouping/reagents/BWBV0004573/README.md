##Europese Overeenkomst betreffende de uitwisseling van testsera voor bloedgroepenonderzoek

####European Agreement on the exchanges of blood-grouping reagents

The signatory Governments of the member States of the Council of Europe, Considering that blood-grouping reagents are not available in unlimited quantities; Considering that it is most desirable that member countries, in a spirit of European solidarity, should assist one another in the supply of these blood-grouping reagents, should the need arise; Considering that such mutual assistance is only possible if the character and use of such blood-grouping reagents are subject to rules laid down jointly by the member countries and if the necessary import facilities and exemptions are granted,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the expression “blood-grouping reagents” refers to reagents of human, animal and plant and other origin, used for blood-grouping and for the detection of blood incompatibilities. Any Contracting Party may, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, when signing this Agreement or depositing its instrument of ratification or approval, or accession, limit the application of this Agreement to blood-grouping reagents of human origin. This declaration may be withdrawn at any time, by notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  

### Article  2  

The Contracting Parties undertake, provided that they have sufficient stocks for their own needs, to make blood-grouping reagents available to other Parties who are in urgent need of them and to charge only those costs of collection, processing and carriage of such substances and the cost (if any) of their purchase.  

### Article  3  

Blood-grouping reagents shall be made available to the other Contracting Parties subject to the condition that no profit is made on them, that they shall be used solely for medical purposes and shall be delivered only to bodies designated by the Governments concerned.  

### Article  4  

The Contracting Parties shall certify that the provisions as laid down in the Protocol to this Agreement have been observed. They shall also comply with any rules to which they have subscribed with regard to international standardisation in this field. All consignments of blood-grouping reagents shall be accompanied by a certificate to the effect that they were prepared in accordance with the specifications in the Protocol. This certificate shall be based on the model to be found in the Annex to the Protocol. The Protocol and its Annex constitute en administrative arrangement and may be amended or supplemented by the Governments of the Parties to this Agreement.  

### Article  5  

The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to exempt from all import duties the blood-grouping reagents placed at their disposal by the other Parties. They shall also take all necessary measures to provide for the speedy delivery of these substances, by the most direct route, to the consignees referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement.  

### Article  6  

The Contracting Parties shall forward to one another, through the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, a list of the bodies empowered to issue certificates as provided in Article 4 of this Agreement. They shall also forward a list of bodies empowered to distribute imported blood-grouping reagents. Wherever possible these bodies should be the same as those referred to in Article 6 of the European Agreement on the Exchange of Therapeutic Substances of Human Origin.  

### Article  7  

The present Agreement shall be open to the signature of Members of the Council of Europe, who may become Parties to it either by: 

(a) signature without reservation in respect of ratification or approval, or  

(b) signature with reservation in respect of ratification or approval, followed by ratification or approval.   Instruments of ratification or approval shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  

### Article  8  

The present Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date on which three Members of the Council shall, in accordance with Article 7, have signed the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or shall have ratified or approved it. In the case of any Member of the Council who shall subsequently sign the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who shall ratify or approve it, the Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date of such signature or the date of deposit of the instrument of ratification or approval.  

### Article  9  

After the entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non-member State to accede to the present Agreement. Such accession shall take effect one month after the date of deposit of the instrument of accession with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  

### Article  10  

The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify Members of the Council and acceding States: 

(a) of the date of entry into force of this Agreement and of the names of any Members who have signed without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who have ratified or approved it;

####Protocol to the European Agreement on the exchanges of blood-grouping reagents

###General provisions

1.  *Specificity*  A blood-grouping reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label. <sup> 1)  At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its annexes, it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression “blood incompatibilities” was mentioned, “blood grouping incompatibilities” was implied.   It was also agreed that the expression “blood-grouping” with a hyphen in the English text of the Agreement and of the Protocol should read as “blood grouping” without a hyphen.  </sup> When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena: 

(a) haemolytic properties;  

(b) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label;  

(c) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions;  

(d) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux;  

(e) prozone phenomena.    

2.  *Potency*  Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium. To each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles. The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs, the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume. In the case of anti-A, anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides, avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide.  

3.  *International Standards and International Units*  International Standards have been established by the World Health Organisation for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities. An International Standard Preparation contains, by definition, a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations <sup>1)</sup>. 1) The potency of blood-grouping reagents of most specificities is expressed as the agglutination titre observed in a dilution series, against a suspension of red-cells. The titre indicates the dilution of reagent in the last mixture of the series which shows agglutination microscopically visible. The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist (at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D) can be expressed in International Units (*) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard, or national sub-standard. The International Standard Preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum. When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml. They can be obtained free of charge, from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO, Statens Seruminstitut,Copenhagen. The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum (S) and an “unknown” anti-A reagent (U) against A <sub>1</sub> red corpuscles and A <sub>2</sub> B red corpuscles.  

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| --- | Serum S  | Reagent U  | Serum S  | Reagent U  |
| A <sub>1</sub> corpuscles  | 1:512  | 1:128  | 256  | 64  |
| A <sub>2</sub> B corpuscles  | 1: 32  | 1: 16  | 256  | 128  |
| --- | titres (observed)  | titres (observed)  | Units (by definition)  | Units (by comparison)  |

(*) See Bull, Wld. Hlth. Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301.  

4.  *Stability and expiry date*  Each reagent, when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer, should retain the requisite properties for at least one year. The expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test. The expiry date can be extended for further periods of one year by repetition of potency tests. The expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label, shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national authorities.  

5.  *Preservation*  Blood-grouping reagents may be preserved in the liquid or dried state. Dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo, in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture. A dried reagent must not lose more than 0.5 per cent of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0.02 mm of mercury for 24 hours. Reagents shall be prepared with aseptic precautions and shall be free from bacterial contamination. In order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and/or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent (or to any solvent issued with dried reagents), provided that, in the presence of the added substance, the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency. Blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum. Reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment, gel or visible particles.  

6.  *Coloration*  Blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system. Any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction.  

7.  *Dispensing and volume*  Blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles. The volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this Protocol.  

8.  *Records and samples*  Written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents. Adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use.  

9.  *Classification of reagents*  Reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human, animal, vegetable (or mineral) origin, of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent. For technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle. This does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin.  

10.  *Labels, leaflets and certificates*  A label printed in English and French, in black on white paper, shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information: 

1. Name and address of producer  

2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification.  

3. Name and amount of antiseptic and/or antibiotic, if present, or indication of absence  

4. The volume or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution  

5. Expiry date  

6. Batch number.   Moreover, this label or the label of the carton enclosing several final containers, or the leaflet accompanying the containers, shall contain the following information: 

1. Full name and address of producer  

2. Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification  

3. The volume, or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution  

4. Date of last potency test  

5. Expiry date (if any)  

6. Batch number  

7. Adequate description of the method of use recommended by the producer  

8. Conditions of storage of unopened ampoules and precautions to be taken after opening  

9. Exact composition, including antiseptic and/or antibiotic if any  

10. Statement whether the product contains or does not contain material of human origin.   Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate as provided in Article 4 of the Agreement and the Annex to the present Protocol. Examples of labels and leaflets are attached to the present Protocol.     

####Specific provisions

### A  

####Blood-grouping sera of human origin

(a)  *Sera of human origin for ABO grouping*  

(i)  *Anti-A blood-grouping serum (human)*  Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of selected group B persons, who may or may not have been immunised by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substance. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A <sub>1</sub>, A <sub>2</sub>, A <sub>1</sub> B and A <sub>2</sub> B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups O and B. 
###POTENCY

Titration An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A <sub>1</sub>, A <sub>2</sub>, and A <sub>2</sub> B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml. Determination of avidity When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A <sub>1</sub>, A <sub>2</sub> and A <sub>2</sub> B cells with a volume fraction of 0.05 to 0.1, agglutination of each suspension should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.  

(ii)  *Anti-B blood-grouping serum (human)*  Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of selected group A persons, who may or may not have been immunised by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substance. Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups O and A. 
###POTENCY

Titration An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation. The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml. Determination of avidity When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0.05 to 0.1, agglutination should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with reference standard of equivalent avidity.  

(iii) *Anti-A* + *Anti-B (group O) blood-grouping serum (human)* Anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum is derived from the blood of selected group O persons who may or may not have been immunised by group A and group B red corpuscles or group A and group B specific substances. Anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A or B agglutinogens or both, i.e. those of group A including sub-groups A <sub>1</sub> and A <sub>2</sub>, group B and group AB including sub-groups A <sub>1</sub> B and A <sub>2</sub> B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A or B agglutinogens, i.e. those of group O. It agglutinates human red corpuscles containing the A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> or A <sub>0</sub>) antigen (which are not, in general, agglutinated by anti-A serum derived from group B donors). 
###POTENCY

Titration An anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A <sub>1</sub> and A <sub>2</sub> corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation. It shall also be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation. The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml. Anti-A + anti-B (group O) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> or A <sub>0</sub>) corpuscles. Determination of avidity When anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum is mixed on a slide with equal volumes of suspensions of A <sub>1</sub> of A <sub>2</sub> cells with a volume fraction of 0.05 to 0.1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same tests are performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity. When anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 6.05 to 0.1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or a reference preparation of equivalent avidity. When anti-A + anti-B (group O) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> or A <sub>0</sub>) cells with a volume fraction of 0.05 to 0.1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than 5 minutes at a temperature between 18 and 25° C.    

(b)  *Sera of human origin for Rh grouping*  Anti-Rh blood grouping sera, whatever their specificity, may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained. Certain sera commonly known as “complete” agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline. With others, commonly known as “incomplete”, agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques. The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them. Some “incomplete” sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides. The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available. 

(i)  *Anti-D (anti-Rh <sub>o</sub>) blood-grouping serum (human)*  Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunised by the D antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen. 
###POTENCY

Titration “Complete” anti-D sera shall have a titre not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 gram sodium chloride per litre. An “incomplete” anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D (anti-Rh <sub>o</sub>) or an equivalent reference preparation. It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units. Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen, the serum should, as far as possible, react with corpuscles containing the D <sup>u</sup> antigen. Determination of avidity Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40% to 50% suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40° C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.  

(ii)  *Anti-C (anti-Rh') blood-grouping serum (human)*  Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunised by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system. It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen, but not with human red corpuscles, which do not contain the C antigen. In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the C <sup>w</sup> antigen. Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain “complete” anti-C together with “incomplete” anti-D. These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 gram sodium chloride per litre. 
###POTENCY

Titration Anti-C sera (“complete” or “incomplete”) should have a titre not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles. Determination of avidity Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must not contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0.4 to 0.5, at approximately 40° C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.  

(iii)  *Anti-E (anti-rh”) blood-grouping serum (human)*  Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunised by the E antigen of the Rh system. It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen. 
###POTENCY

Titration Anti-E sera (“complete” or “incomplete”) should have a titre not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles. Determination of avidity Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson (and which must contain any form of anti-D) should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0.4 to 0.5, at approximately 40° C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.  

(iv) *Anti-D* + *C (anti-Rh <sub>o</sub> rh’) blood-grouping serum (human)* *Anti-D* + *E (anti-Rh <sub>o</sub> rh”) blood-grouping serum (human)* Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunised individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum. In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer. Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies, and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D + C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies, but in the case of anti-D + C (which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunised persons) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should not be less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should not be less than 8. Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson, the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies.      

### B

(a)  *Sera of animal origin*  

(i)  *Anti-A blood-grouping serum (animal)*  Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunised by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substances. Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A <sub>1</sub>, A <sub>2</sub>, A <sub>1</sub> B and A <sub>2</sub> B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups O and B. 
###POTENCY

Titration An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A <sub>1</sub>, A <sub>2</sub>*,* and A <sub>2</sub> B red corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A bloodgrouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation .

(iii)  *Anti-human-globulin serum (animal)*  <sup> 2)  Coombs, R. R. A., Mourant, A. E. and Race, R. R. (1945), Lancet, ii 15   Coombs, R. R. A., Mourant, A. E. and Race, R. R. (1945), Brit. J. exp. Path, 26, 255.  </sup> Anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must contain agglutinating antibodies against IgG globulin and agglutinating antibodies against complement factors. It is derived from the blood of animals immunised by the injection of human serum protein. It must agglutinate all human red corpuscles coated with human IgG and/or complement factors. Under the conditions specified by the manufacturers it does not agglutinate uncoated human red corpuscles, to whatever group they may belong. Specificity The specificity of an anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must be tested with human red corpuscles coated with a variety of antibodies i.e. red corpuscles sensitised with human incomplete antibodies anti-D, anti-K and anti-Fya, red corpuscles sensitised with complement-binding incomplete antibodies anti-Le <sup>a</sup> in the presence of fresh human serum, and red corpuscles sensitised with so-called “incomplete cold antibodies” and with tanned red corpuscles sensitised with human IgG and, finally, with 10 different samples of non-coated human red corpuscles with and without A and B antigens. 
###POTENCY

Titration An anti-human globulin serum, as supplied, or at the dilution recommended on the label, shall strongly agglutinate human red corpuscles coated with a human incomplete anti-D serum, having a titre of 4 (or less) against D-positive corpuscles, when the titration is performed by the albumin replacement method. At the same dilution it shall agglutinate K-positive human red corpuscles sensitised with selected weak anti-K antibodies and Fy <sup>a</sup> positive red corpuscles sensitised with selected weak anti-Fy <sup>a</sup> antibodies. It shall also, at the same or a different dilution, as specified on the label, agglutinate human red corpuscles sensitised with weak complement-binding incomplete anti-Le <sup>a</sup> antibodies in the presence of fresh serum. For clinical use it is desirable that the coating of all the types of incomplete antibodies above shall be detectable with a single dilution of the anti-human globulin serum.

####Protocol bij de Europese Overeenkomst betreffende de uitwisseling van testsera voor bloedgroepenonderzoek

###Algemene bepalingen

1.  *Specificiteit*  Een reagens voor bloedgroepenonderzoek moet met alle geteste bloedspecimens reageren, die het aan de antistof homologe antigeen of andere op het etiket vermelde stoffen bevatten. Wanneer een reagens wordt gebruikt met de door de producent aanbevolen methode, mag geen enkele der navolgende factoren of verschijnselen zich voordoen: 

(a) hemolytische eigenschappen;  

(b) antistoffen of andere stoffen die niet op het etiket vermeld staan;  

(c) bacteriële produkten die vals positieve of vals negatieve reacties teweeg zouden kunnen brengen;  

(d) pseudo-agglutinatie door vorming van geldrollen;  

(e) prozone-effect.    

2.  *Sterkte*  De titer wordt gemeten door van het te onderzoeken reagens een reeks tweevoudige verdunningen te maken in een passende oplossing. Bij iedere verdunning wordt een gelijk volume van een suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes gevoegd. De titer is het getal dat de sterkste verdunning aangeeft waarin nog een reactie valt waar te nemen, waarbij de verdunning wordt berekend zonder in het totale volume het volume van de suspensie van bloedlichaampjes op te nemen. In geval van anti-A, anti-B en andere reagentia voor gebruik op objectglazen, wordt de aviditeit uitgedrukt door de tijd die nodig is voor de agglutinatie op een objectglas.  

3.  *Internationale standaarden en internationale eenheden*  Door de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie zijn internationale normen opgesteld voor de reagentia anti-A en anti-B en incompleet anti-D; deze normen zijn in studie voor reagentia van andere specificiteiten. Een internationaal standaardpreparaat bevat, per definitie, een bepaald aantal internationale eenheden per mg of ml; deze definitie is onafhankelijk van de titers die worden waargenomen wanneer de reagentia met speciale rode bloedlichaampjes worden onderzocht <sup>1</sup>). 

<sup>1</sup>) De sterkte der reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek van de meeste specificiteiten wordt uitgedrukt als de agglutinatietiter welke wordt waargenomen wanneer het reagens in een reeks verdunningen wordt getest met een suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes. De titer geeft de verdunning aan van het reagens in het laatste mengsel van de reeks waarin agglutinatie nog microscopisch waarneembaar is. De sterkte der reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek waarvoor internationale standaardpreparaten (thans alleen nog anti-A en anti-B en incompleet anti-D) bestaan, kan worden uitgedrukt in internationale eenheden *) op basis van titratie van het onbekende reagens in vergelijking met de internationale standaard of met een nationale substandaard. De internationale standaardpreparaten van sera voor bloedgroepenonderzoek worden afgeleverd in ampullen met gedroogd serum van menselijke oorsprong. Wanneer de inhoud wordt opgelost tot een hoeveelheid van 1 ml bevatten de anti-A en anti-B sera per definitie 256 Internationale Eenheden per ml. Deze ampullen worden gratis verstrekt door het Internationale Laboratorium voor biologische standaarden van de W.G.O., Statens Seruminstituut, Kopenhagen. De navolgende tabel geeft een voorbeeld van een vergelijkende titratie van het internationale standaardserum anti-A (S) en een „onbekend” reagens anti-A (U) getest met rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen A <sub>1</sub> en A <sub>2</sub> B.

* Zie Bull. Wld. Hlth. Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301.    

4.  *Stabiliteit en vervaldatum*  Ieder reagens dat is opgeslagen onder de door de producent aanbevolen omstandigheden, moet de vereiste eigenschappen ten minste een jaar behouden. Voor reagentia in vloeibare toestand mag de op het etiket aangegeven vervaldatum niet later zijn dan een jaar na de datum waarop bij de laatste controle een voldoende werkzaamheid werd bevonden. Na volgende controles op de werkzaamheid kan de vervaldatum steeds een jaar worden opgeschoven. Ten aanzien van reagentia in gedroogde toestand dient de op het etiket vermelde vervaldatum in overeenstemming te zijn met het resultaat der stabiliteitsproeven, en moet deze worden goedgekeurd door de nationale autoriteiten die met de controle zijn belast.  

5.  *Wijze van bewaren*  Reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek kunnen in vloeibare of in gedroogde toestand worden bewaard. De gedroogde reagentia dienen te worden bewaard onder inert gas of in vacuo, in een glazen houder die zodanig is afgesloten dat geen vocht kan binnendringen. Indien een gedroogd reagens boven fosforpentoxyde bij ten hoogste 0,02 mm kwikdruk verder wordt gedroogd, mag na 24 uur niet meer dan 0,5 percent gewichtsverlies optreden. De reagentia moeten onder aseptische voorzorgen worden bereid en mogen niet met bacteriën zijn besmet. Ter bestrijding van bacteriën kan de bevoegde autoriteit van ieder land beslissen dat aan elk reagens (of aan elk oplosmiddel dat bij de gedroogde reagentia wordt geleverd) een antiseptlcum en/of een antibioticum wordt toegevoegd, op voorwaarde dat het reagens ook met deze toevoeging blijft beantwoorden aan de normen van specificiteit en sterkte. De sera van menselijke oorsprong voor bloedgroepenonderzoek moeten per ml vloeibaar of opgelost serum ten minste 2,5 mg eiwitstikstof bevatten. Zowel de vloeibare als de opgeloste sera moeten helder zijn en mogen geen neerslag, gel of zichtbare deeltjes bevatten.  

6.  *Kleur*  Het is wenselijk dat aan reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek die met het buitenland worden uitgewisseld, geen kleurstof wordt toegevoegd, althans totdat er bij internationale overeenkomst een eenheidssysteem wordt aangenomen. Een toegevoegde kleurstof mag geen invloed hebben op de specifieke reactie.  

7.  *Verstrekking en hoeveelheid*  De reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek dienen op dusdanige wijze en in dusdanige hoeveelheden te worden verstrekt dat het reagens uit één houder voldoende is voor het uitvoeren van tests met positieve en negatieve controle bloedlichaampjes, evenals voor tests met de onbekende bloedlichaampjes. De hoeveelheid in iedere houder moet zodanig zijn dat men eventueel ook proeven kan uitvoeren ter bepaling van de sterkte zoals omschreven in dit Protocol.  

8.  *Registers en specimens*  Het laboratorium waar de reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek worden bereid dient nauwkeurig het verloop van produktie en controle van de reagentia bij te houden. Er dienen van alle verstrekte reagentia voldoende specimens door het laboratorium te worden bewaard totdat mag worden aangenomen dat de desbetreffende partij niet langer in gebruik is.  

9.  *Indeling der reagentia*  Reagentia voor bloedgroepenonderzoek kunnen stoffen bevatten die van menselijke, dierlijke, plantaardige (of minerale) oorsprong zijn, waarvan sommige de actieve stof en andere hulpmiddelen zijn voor het versterken van de werkingskracht of voor het behoud van de stabiliteit. Om technische redenen zijn deze reagentia ingedeeld in drie categorieën, en wel naar de oorsprong van hun actieve stof. Dit wil niet zeggen dat reagentia van menselijke oorsprong uitsluitend stoffen van menselijke oorsprong bevatten, of dat de dierlijke of plantaardige reagentia geen stoffen van menselijke oorsprong mogen bevatten.  

10.  *Etikettering, handleiding, verklaring*  Een wit etiket met zwarte opdruk in het Engels en in het Frans wordt bevestigd op iedere klaargemaakte houder en hierop zijn de navolgende gegevens vermeld: 

1. Naam en adres van de instelling waar het reagens is bereid  

2. Naam van het reagens zoals aangegeven in de desbetreffende handleiding  

3. Naam en hoeveelheid antisepticum en/of antibioticum, indien aanwezig, of aanduiding dat deze stoffen ontbreken  

4. Volume of, indien het een gedroogd reagens betreft, volume en samenstelling van de voor de oplossing ervan benodigde vloeistof  

5. Vervaldatum  

6. Nummer van de partij.   Verder bevat dit etiket of het etiket op de doos waarin zich verschillende klaargemaakte houders bevinden, of de handleiding gevoegd bij de houders, de navolgende gegevens: 

1. Naam en adres van de instelling waar het reagens is bereid  

2. Naam van het reagens zoals aangegeven in de desbetreffende handleiding  

3. Volume of, indien het een gedroogd reagens betreft, volume en samenstelling van de voor de oplossing ervan benodigde vloeistof  

4. Datum waarop voor het laatst de werkzaamheid is gecontroleerd  

5. (Eventuele) vervaldatum  

6. Nummer van de partij  

7. Nauwkeurige omschrijving van de door de producent aanbevolen gebruikswijze  

8. De omstandigheden waaronder ongeopende ampullen dienen te worden opgeslagen, alsmede de te nemen maatregelen bij het bewaren van geopende ampullen  

9. Juiste samenstelling, alsmede het antisepticum en/of het antibioticum, indien aanwezig  

10. Aanduiding betreffende de aan- of afwezigheid van stoffen van menselijke oorsprong.   Iedere zending moet vergezeld gaan van een verklaring overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 4 van de Overeenkomst en in de Bijlage bij dit Protocol. Voorbeelden betreffende etiket en handleiding zijn toegevoegd aan dit Protocol.

(iii) *Anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)* Het anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) wordt bereid uit bloed van geselecteerde personen van groep O, die al dan niet zijn geïmmuniseerd met rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen A en B of met AB substantie. Het anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) agglutineert rode bloedlichaampjes van menselijke oorsprong die de agglutinogenen A of B bevatten of de agglutinogenen A en B, d.w.z. die van groep A, alsmede de subgroepen A <sub>1</sub> en A <sub>2</sub>, groep B en groep AB, alsmede de subgroepen A <sub>1</sub> B en A <sub>2</sub> B en agglutineert niet de rode bloedlichaampjes van menselijke oorsprong die geen agglutinogeen A of B bevatten, d.w.z. die van groep O. Het agglutineert de rode bloedlichaampjes van menselijke oorsprong die het antigeen A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> of A <sub>o</sub>) bevatten (die over het algemeen niet worden geagglutineerd door anti-A serum bereid uit het bloed van donors van groep B). 
###STERKTE:

Titratie De titer van een anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) dient afzonderlijk te worden vastgesteld met suspensies van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen A <sub>1</sub> en A <sub>2</sub>, aan de hand van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-A of een equivalent vergelijkingspreparaat. De titer hiervan moet eveneens worden vastgesteld met een suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroep B aan de hand van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bioedgroepenonderzoek anti-B, of een equivalent standaardpreparaat. De sterkte van het serum mag in geen geval minder zijn dan 64 internationale eenheden per ml. Het niet verdunde anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) voor bloedgroepenonderzoek moet eveneens een duidelijk waarneembare agglutinatie te zien geven van rode bloedlichaampjes van groep A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> of A <sub>o</sub>). Bepaling van de aviditeit Wanneer het anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) op een objectglas wordt vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 5 a 10 % -ige suspensie van rods bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen en A <sub>2</sub> moet er bij iedere suspensie agglutinatie optreden binnen het dubbele van de tijd die nodig is voor het onder gelijke omstandigheden tot stand brengen van agglutinatie door middel van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-A of een standaardpreparaat met dezelfde aviditeit. Wanneer het anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) op een objectglas wordt vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 5 a 10 % -ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroep B, moet er agglutinatie optreden binnen het dubbele van de tijd die nodig is voor het onder gelijke omstandigheden tot stand brengen van agglutinatie door middel van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-B of een standaardpreparaat met dezelfde aviditeit. Wanneer een anti-A plus anti-B serum (groep O) op een objectglas wordt vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 5 a 10 % -ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroep A <sub>x</sub> (A <sub>y</sub> of A <sub>o</sub>) moet er binnen 5 minuten agglutinatie optreden bij een temperatuur van 18° tot 25°C.    

(b)  *Sera van menselijke oorsprong voor Rhesus-bloedgroepenonderzoek*  De testsera voor Rhesus-bloedgroepen kunnen, ongeacht hun specificiteit, van tweeërlei aard zijn afhankelijk van de omstandigheden waaronder zij homologe rode bloedlichaampjes agglutineren. Sommige sera, de zg. „complete”, agglutineren rode bloedlichaampjes in een fysiologische zoutoplossing, andere sera, de zg. „incomplete”, agglutineren alleen in aanwezigheid van bepaalde colloïden, zoals runderalbumine, of door middel van andere speciale technieken. De sera moeten worden gebruikt volgens de voorschriften van het bereidend laboratorium. Sommige „incomplete” sera agglutineren ook op een objectglas homologe rode bloedlichaampjes gesuspendeerd in hun eigen serum of plasma. De navolgende eisen betreffende de sterkte der sera voor het Rhesus-groepenonderzoek kunnen worden herzien wanneer er internationale standaardpreparaten komen. 

(i)  *Anti-D (anti-Rh <sub>0</sub>) serum voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)*  Het anti-D serum wordt bereid uit bloed van een of meer personen, die zijn geïmmuniseerd met het D antigeen van het Rhesussysteem. Het reageert met menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het D antigeen bevatten, maar niet met menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het D antigeen niet bevatten. 
###STERKTE:

Titratie De titer van „complete” anti-D sera mag niet lager zijn dan 32 met een suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes met het Rhesusgenotype Cc Dee (R <sub>1</sub> r) in een 0,9 % -ige oplossing van natriumchloride. De titer van een „incompleet” anti-D serum dient te worden vastgesteld met een suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes met het Rhesusgenotype Cc Dee aan de hand van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat van incompleet anti-D (anti Rh <sub>0</sub>) of een equivalent vergelijkingspreparaat. De sterkte mag in geen geval minder zijn dan 32 internationale eenheden. Het serum moet niet alleen reageren met alle rode bloedlichaampjes die het D antigeen bevatten, maar zoveel mogelijk ook met bloedlichaampjes die het Du antigeen bevatten. Bepaling van de aviditeit De anti-D sera voor gebruik volgens de objectglasmethode van Diamond en Abelson moeten, wanneer ze op een objectglas worden vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 40 a 50 % -ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van het genotype Cc Dee, bij ongeveer 40 °C binnen 30 seconden een zichtbare agglutinatie teweegbrengen, die binnen 120 seconden volledig moet zijn.  

(ii)  *Anti-C serum (and-Rh') voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)*  Het anti-C serum wordt bereid uit bloed van een of meer personen die zijn geïmmuniseerd met het C anti geen van het Rhesussysteem. Het agglutineert suspensies van menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het C antigeen bevatten, maar niet suspensies van menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het C antigeen niet bevatten. In dit verband wordt het antigeen Cw gerekend tot het C antigeen te behoren. De meeste anti-C sera voor diagnostisch gebruik bevatten „complete” antistoffen anti-C evenals „incomplete” antistoffen anti-D. Deze sera zijn derhalve slechts specifiek voor het C antigeen, indien de te testen rode bloedlichaampjes zijn gesuspendeerd in een 0,9 % -ige oplossing van natriumchloride. 
###STERKTE:

Titratie De titer van anti-C sera („compleet” of „incompleet”) mag niet lager zijn dan 8 met rode bloedlichaampjes van het genotype Ccddee. Bepaling van de aviditeit De anti-C sera voor gebruik volgens de objectglasmethode van Diamond en Abelson (die geen enkele vorm van anti-D mogen bevatten) moeten, wanneer ze op een objectglas worden vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 40 a 50 %-ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van het genotype Ccddee bij ongeveer 40 °C binnen 30 seconden een zichtbare agglutinatie teweegbrengen, die binnen 120 seconden volledig moet zijn.  

(iii)  *Anti-E serum (anti-Rh”) voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)*  Het anti-E serum wordt bereid uit bloed van een of meer personen die zijn geïmmuniseerd met het E antigeen van het Rhesussysteem. Het reageert met menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het E antigeen bevatten. 
###STERKTE:

Titratie De titer van anti-E sera („compleet” of „incompleet”) mag niet lager zijn dan 8 met rode bloedlichaampjes van het genotype ccddEe. Bepaling van de aviditeit De anti-E sera voor gebruik volgens de objectglasmethode van Diamond en Abelson (die geen enkele vorm van anti-D mogen bevatten) moeten, wanneer ze op een objectglas worden vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 40 a 50 %-ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van het genotype ccddEe, bij ongeveer 40°C binnen 30 seconden een zichtbare agglutinatie teweegbrengen die binnen 120 seconden volledig moet zijn.  

(iv)  *Anti-D plus C serum (Anti-Rh <sub>o</sub> rh') voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)*   *Anti-D plus E serum (Anti-Rhorh”) voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van menselijke oorsprong)*  Sera met de specificiteit anti-D plus C of anti-D plus E kunnen rechtstreeks worden verkregen uit het bloed van geïmmuniseerde personen of kunnen worden bereid door een anti-D serum te mengen met een anti-G of anti-E serum. In een bepaald serum moeten de beide antistoffen gelijktijdig werkzaam zijn onder de reactieomstandigheden opgegeven door de producent. Ieder serum moet reageren met alle typen rode bloedlichaampjes die zouden reageren met een van beide antistoffen in het serum, en mogen niet reageren met de rode bloedlichaampjes die noch het C antigeen noch het D antigeen bevatten in geval van anti-D + C, en noch het D, noch het E antigeen in geval van anti-D + E. De titers mogen niet lager zijn dan die, welke zijn aangegeven voor de twee antistoffen die het serum bevat, maar in geval van anti-D plus C (een veelvuldig voorkomende combinatie in het serum van geïmmuniseerde personen) is het wenselijk dat de titer van het anti-C niet lager is dan 32, terwijl het in het geval van anti-D plus E wenselijk is dat de anti-E titer niet lager is dan 8. Bij een serum voor gebruik volgens de object glasmethode van Diamond en Abelson, mogen de agglutinatie tij den voor alle typen reagerende rode bloedlichaampjes niet korter zijn dan die welke voor ieder bestanddeel zijn aangegeven.

Bepaling van de aviditeit Wanneer het anti-B serum op een objectglas wordt vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 5 a 10 %-ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van bloedgroep B, moet er agglutinatie optreden binnen het dubbele van de tijd die nodig is voor het onder gelijke omstandigheden tot stand brengen van agglutinatie door middel van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-B of een standaardpreparaat met dezelfde aviditeit.  

(ii)  *Anti-menselijk globuline-serum (van dierlijke oorsprong)*  <sup> 2)  Coombs, R.R.A., Mourant, A.E. and Race, R.R. (1945), Lancet, ii, 15. Coombs, R.R.A., Mourant, A.E. and Race, R.R. (1945), Brit. J. exp. Path, 26, 255.  </sup> Anti-menselijk globuline-serum, dat wordt gebruikt bij bloedgroepenserologie, dient agglutinerende antistoffen tegen immunoglobuline G en agglutinerende antistoffen tegen complement factoren te bevatten. Het wordt bereid uit het bloed van dieren die zijn geimmuniseerd door inspuiting met menselijk serumeiwit. Het moet alle menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes agglutineren waarop zich menselijk immunoglobuline G en/of complement factoren hebben gehecht. Wanneer het serum wordt gebruikt overeenkomstig de voorschriften van de producent, agglutineert het niet menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes waarop zich deze globulinen niet bevinden, onverschillig tot welke bloedgroep zij behoren. Specificiteit De specificiteit van een anti-menselijk globuline-serum dat wordt gebruikt bij bloedgroepenserologie dient te worden getest met menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes waarop zich een aantal verschillende antistoffen hebben gehecht, te weten rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met menselijke incomplete antistoffen anti-D, anti-K en anti-, rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met complement-bindende incomplete antistoffen anti in aanwezigheid van vers menselijk serum, rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met z.g. „incomplete koude antistoffen”, getanneerde rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met menselijk immunoglobuline G, en ten slotte met tien verschillende monsters van niet gesensibiliseerde menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes, met en zonder A en B antigenen. 
###STERKTE:

Bij dezelfde verdunning moet het agglutinatie teweegbrengen van K-positieve menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met geselecteerde zwakke anti-K antistoffen en van -positieve rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met geselecteerde zwakke anti-Fy <sup>a</sup> antistoffen. Bij dezelfde verdunning of bij een verschillende verdunning (volgens aanduiding op het etiket), moet het eveneens agglutinatie teweegbrengen van menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die zijn gesensibiliseerd met zwakke complementbindende incomplete antistoffen anti-, die slechts kunnen worden aangetoond in aanwezigheid van vers serum. Voor klinisch gebruik is het wenselijk dat de aanwezigheid van alle bovengenoemde incomplete antistoffen op de rode bloedlichaampjes kan worden aangetoond met een enkele verdunning van het antimenselijke globuline-serum.

Titratie De titer van een anti-A reagens dient afzonderlijk te worden vastgesteld met suspensies van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen A <sub>1</sub>, , en A <sub>2</sub> B aan de hand van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-A of een equivalent vergelijkingspreparaat . <sup> 1)  Het „internationale standaardpreparaat” is van menselijke oorsprong; het eventueel te gebruiken equivalente vergelijkingspreparaat kan zowel van menselijke als van niet-menselijke oorsprong zijn.  </sup> De sterkte van het reagens mag in geen geval minder zijn dan 64 internationale eenheden per ml. Bepaling van de aviditeit Wanneer het anti-A reagens op een objectglas wordt vermengd met een gelijk volume van een 5 a 10 %-ige suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes van de bloedgroepen , en moet er bij iedere suspensie agglutinatie optreden binnen het dubbele van de tijd die nodig is voor het onder gelijke omstandigheden tot stand brengen van de agglutinatie door middel van het opgeloste maar niet verdunde internationale standaardpreparaat voor bloedgroepenonderzoek anti-A of een standaardpreparaat met dezelfde aviditeit.   

(ii)  *Anti-B reagens voor bloedgroepenonderzoek (van plantaardige oorsprong)*  Het anti-B reagens wordt bereid uit een bepaald deel van een voor dit gebruik geschikte plant en wordt vervolgens, zo nodig, gezuiverd. Het anti-B reagens agglutineert menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die het B antigeen bevatten, d.w.z. die van de groepen B en AB, en agglutineert niet menselijke rode bloedlichaampjes die dit B antigeen niet bevatten, d.w.z. die van de groepen O en A.

1. Centraal Laboratorium voor Bloedtransfusie, 1, Main Street, Metropolis, Westland  

2. Serum anti-E (anti-rh”) (van menselijke oorsprong)  

3. 10 ml  

4. De datum waarop de werkzaamheid het laatst is gecontroleerd: 30 mei 1961  

5. Vervaldatum: 30 mei 1962  

6. N° 5432  

7. De te onderzoeken rode bloedlichaampjes worden een of meer malen gewassen in een 0,9 % -ige oplossing van natriumchloride. Vervolgens wordt een suspensie gemaakt van ongeveer 3 % door één volume of één druppel opeengepakte rode bloedlichaampjes te vermengen met 30 volumen of 30 druppels van een fysiologische zoutoplossing. Met enige ervaring kan de sterkte van een suspensie vrij nauwkeurig worden geschat met het blote oog. Een druppel van het serum wordt met behulp van een Pasteurse pipet in een hemolyse-buisje (6 mm X 30 mm) gedaan, waar vervolgens een gelijke druppel van de suspensie van rode bloedlichaampjes aan wordt toegevoegd. (Met enige ervaring en als men een meetpipet met een schaalverdeling van 0,01 ml gebruikt, heeft men slechts een geringe hoeveelheid serum en suspensie van bloedlichaampjes nodig). De inhoud van het buisje wordt gemengd en wordt gedurende twee uur geïncubeerd bij een temperatuur van 37° C. Vervolgens wordt de inhoud van het buisje voorzichtig op een objectglaasje overgebracht en uitgespreid. Indien de agglutinatie met het blote oog niet duidelijk waarneembaar is, wordt het objectglaasje met de microscoop onderzocht om vast te stellen of en in welke mate er agglutinatie is opgetreden.  

8. Bewaren bij een temperatuur van -20° C of lager. Bij het resterende produkt dat niet op dezelfde dag wordt gebruikt, 0,1 ml van een 10 % -ige N3Na-oplossing toevoegen.
