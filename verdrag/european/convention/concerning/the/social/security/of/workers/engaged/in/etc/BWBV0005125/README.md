The Governments of the States Signatory hereto, Considering the Agreement concerning the social security of Rhine boatmen, signed at Paris on 27 July 1950 under the auspices of the International Labour Organisation, which came into force on 1 June 1953; Considering the General Agreement on Economic Regulations for International Road Transport, including the Set of Rules annexed thereto, the Additional Protocol and the Protocol of Signature, signed at Geneva on 17 March 1954; Considering that the present development of international transport between their countries by land, air and inland navigation necessitates a multilateral instrument to provide for an effective protection of workers engaged in such transport when, in cases of sickness, maternity, employment injury or death, they need social security benefits in the territory of a Contracting Party other than the country to the laws and regulations of which the said workers are subject; Affirming, in respect of workers engaged in international transport and of the benefits mentioned above, the principle of equality of treatment of the nationals of each of the Contracting Parties as regards the application of national laws and regulations on social security, a principle already enunciated in international labour Conventions; and Considering that the cost of social security benefits provided in the cases mentioned above should, as a rule, be borne by the institution of the Contracting Party to the laws and regulations of which the worker concerned is subject;   Have agreed as follows:

### Part  II  

####Provisions concerning social security benefits

### Article  3  

1.  A worker who, for the purposes of his employment, as specified in paragraph (*h*) of Article 1 of this Convention, finds himself in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties other than that whose legislation is applicable to him, and whose condition necessitates the provision of sickness and maternity benefits, shall be entitled to such benefits as if he were in the territory of the Contracting Party whose legislation is applicable to him.   
2.  Nevertheless, benefits in kind which are immediately necessary shall be furnished by the institution of the place of sojourn; in so far as the extent and duration of these benefits and the manner in which they are provided are concerned, they shall be furnished according to the legislation of the country where this institution is situated. Where this legislation provides for several sickness and maternity benefit schemes based on different provisions, the applicable provisions shall be those which apply to workers employed by a transport undertaking of the same kind as that which employs the worker concerned. In so far as the extent or the duration of benefits in kind is more favourable under the legislation administered by the competent institution than under the legislation administered by the institution of the place of sojourn, such benefits shall be furnished by the latter institution in so far as this is possible, at the request of the competent institution.   
3.  The right of a worker to benefits in kind in accordance with the legislation to which he is subject shall be maintained to the extent to which it still exists after the provision of benefits in accordance with the preceding paragraph. If the said legislation provides for a maximum duration of benefits, the competent institution, in determining whether the said maximum duration is exhausted, shall take into account the period for which benefits have been furnished in accordance with the preceding paragraph, where the condition of the worker necessitates benefits for the same case of sickness of maternity after return to the country in which this institution has its head office.   
4.  Prosthetic and major surgical appliances and other more important benefits in kind to be specified by agreement by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall be granted only if the competent institution agrees.   
5.  Benefits in cash shall be paid in accordance with the legislation administered by the competent institution. At the request of the said institution, the payment may be made on its behalf by the institution of the place of sojourn.   
6.  The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall be applicable by analogy to the members of the family of a worker employed on board a vessel engaged in inland navigation who live with him on such vessel.   

### Article  4  

1.  A worker who suffers an employment injury in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and who, for the purposes of his employment, as specified in paragraph (*h*) of Article 1 of this Convention, finds himself in the territory of a Contracting Party other than that whose legislation is applicable to him, shall be entitled to benefits in kind and periodical benefits in cash other than pensions as if he had suffered the employment injury in the territory of the Contracting Party whose legislation is applicable to him.   
2.  Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 3 shall be applicable by analogy to benefits in kind.   
3.  Where there is no employment injury insurance scheme in the territory of the Contracting Party where the worker finds himself, or where such a scheme exists but does not provide for institutions to furnish benefits in kind, these benefits shall be furnished by that institution of the place of sojourn which is responsible for furnishing benefits in kind in case of sickness.   
4.  If any legislation provides benefits in kind free of charge only if the beneficiary uses a medical service organised by the employer, the benefits in kind provided in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall be considered as having been provided by this medical service.   
5.  Paragraph 5 of Article 3 shall be applicable by analogy to periodical benefits in cash other than pensions.   

### Article  5  

In the cases covered by Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention, the competent institution shall reimburse the actual cost of the benefits in kind to the institution having furnished them. Nevertheless, the competent authorities concerned may agree that there shall be a lump-sum reimbursement; they may also agree, for example, with a view to simplification, that no reimbursement shall be made.  

### Article  6  

If the legislation of a Contracting Party provides benefits in kind for any worker in the territory of that Party without regard to nationality or social insurance and, either absolutely or subject to reciprocal arrangements, without regard to residence, then - 

(a) any worker in the territory of that Party shall be entitled to benefits in kind in accordance with the legislation of that Party;  

(b) no provision of Articles 3 and 4 which concerns benefits in kind shall apply to any worker who is insured under the legislation of that Party or to any worker who finds himself in that territory;  

(c) that Party shall, at the request of any other Party, enter into negotiations with the latter Party for an agreement to provide benefits in kind for workers insured under the legislation of either Party who find themselves in the territory of the other Party.    

### Article  7  

1.  If a worker who is subject to the legislation of one Contracting Party dies in the territory of another Contracting Party in which he finds himself for the purposes of his employment, as specified in paragraph (*h*) of Article 1 of this Convention, the death shall, for the purpose of determining entitlement to a death grant under the said legislation, be deemed to have occurred in the territory of the former Party. The death grant shall not be withheld on the ground that the person claiming it is absent from that territory if he is in the territory of any other Contracting Party.   
2.  The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be applicable by analogy when a member of the family specified under paragraph 6 of Article 3 dies in the territory of a Contracting Party other than that where the competent institution is situated.   

### Article  8  

1.  For the purposes of Articles 3, 4 and 7 of this Convention workers shall be subject to the obligations of and entitled to receive the benefits of the legislation of a Contracting Party of which they are not nationals under the same conditions as the nationals of that Party.   
2.  The cash benefits referred to in this Convention shall not be liable to any reduction, modification, suspension or confiscation by reason of the fact that the worker finds himself for the purposes of his employment, as specified in paragraph (*h*) of Article 1, in the territory of a Contracting Party other than that in which the competent institution is situated.

### Titel  II  

####Bepalingen betreffende de uitkeringen op het gebied der sociale zekerheid

### Artikel  3  

1.  Een arbeider die zich bevindt op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die waarvan de wetgeving op hem van toepassing is gezien de in artikel 1, onder *h*), van dit Verdrag omschreven werkzaamheden, en wiens toestand het verlenen van uitkeringen wegens ziekte of moederschap noodzakelijk maakt, heeft recht op bedoelde uitkeringen alsof hij zich bevond op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij, waarvan de wetgeving op hem van toepassing is.   
2.  De terstond noodzakelijke uitkeringen in natura worden echter verstrekt door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats; wat betreft de omvang, de duur en de wijze der verstrekkingen worden deze uitkeringen verstrekt volgens de wetgeving van het land waar dat orgaan zich bevindt. Indien er ingevolge die wetgeving verschillende stelsels voor de toekenning van uitkeringen bij ziekte en moederschap bestaan, zijn de bepalingen, geldende voor arbeiders in dienst van een vervoersonderneming, welke vergelijkbaar is met die waarbij de betrokken arbeider werkzaam is, op deze laatste van toepassing. Voor zover de omvang of de duur van de uitkeringen in natura overeenkomstig de wetgeving, toegepast door het bevoegd orgaan, gunstiger is dan die overeenkomstig de wetgeving, toegepast door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats, dienen deze uitkeringen voor zover zulks in zijn vermogen ligt te worden verstrekt door het laatstgenoemde orgaan op verzoek van het bevoegde orgaan.   
3.  Het recht van een arbeider op uitkeringen in natura ingevolge de wetgeving, waaraan hij onderworpen is, blijft gehandhaafd voor zover dat recht nog bestaat nadat de uitkeringen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het vorige lid zijn toegekend. Indien genoemde wetgeving voorziet in een maximum uitkeringsduur wordt het tijdvak, waarover overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het voorgaande lid uitkeringen zijn verleend, door het bevoegde orgaan in aanmerking genomen indien de toestand van de arbeider na zijn terugkeer in het land waar dit orgaan gevestigd is het genot van een uitkering voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap noodzakelijk maakt, teneinde vast te stellen of de maximum duur is bereikt.   
4.  Het verschaffen van prothesen, hulpmiddelen van grotere omvang en andere uitkeringen in natura van groot belang, welke in gemeen overleg door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen worden aangewezen, geschiedt onder voorwaarde, dat het bevoegde orgaan daartoe machtiging verleent.   
5.  De uitkeringen in geld worden verstrekt ingevolge de wetgeving, welke wordt toegepast door het bevoegde orgaan. Op verzoek van dit orgaan kan de uitbetaling voor zijn rekening geschieden door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats.   
6.  Het bepaalde in de voorgaande leden is van overeenkomstige toepassing op de gezinsleden van een arbeider werkzaam aan boord van een binnenvaartuig, die met hem op dat vaartuig wonen.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  Een arbeider die op het grondgebied van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen het slachtoffer wordt van een bedrijfsongeval of van een beroepsziekte en zich bevindt op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die, waarvan de wetgeving op hem van toepassing is gezien de in artikel 1, onder *h*), van dit Verdrag omschreven werkzaamheden, heeft recht op uitkeringen in natura en op periodieke uitkeringen in geld anders dan renten, alsof het ongeval of de beroepsziekte ware voorgevallen op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij, waarvan de wetgeving op hem van toepassing is.   
2.  Ten aanzien van de uitkeringen in natura zijn de leden 2, 3 en 4 van artikel 3 van dit Verdrag van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
3.  Indien een verzekering tegen bedrijfsongevallen of beroepsziekten niet bestaat op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij, waarop de arbeider zich bevindt, of indien zodanige verzekering bestaat, doch niet voorziet in organen voor het verstrekken van uitkeringen in natura, worden deze verstrekt door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats, dat bevoegd is voor de toekenning van uitkeringen in natura ingeval van ziekte.   
4.  Indien een wetgeving het geheel kosteloos verstrekken van uitkeringen in natura afhankelijk stelt van het gebruik dat de betrokkene maakt van een door de werkgever ingestelde geneeskundige dienst, worden de uitkeringen in natura, toegekend overeenkomstig de leden 1, 2 en 3 van dit artikel, beschouwd als te zijn verleend door die geneeskundige dienst.   
5.  Ten aanzien van de periodieke uitkeringen in geld, anders dan renten, is artikel 3, lid 5, van dit Verdrag van overeenkomstige toepassing.   

### Artikel  5  

In de gevallen, bedoeld in de artikelen 3 en 4, is het bevoegde orgaan gehouden het werkelijke bedrag van de uitkeringen in natura terug te betalen aan het orgaan dat de uitkeringen heeft verleend. De betrokken bevoegde autoriteiten kunnen echter overeenkomen, dat terugbetaling zal geschieden door middel van een vaste vergoeding; zij kunnen eveneens, vooral met het oog op vereenvoudiging, overeenkomen, dat terugbetaling in het geheel niet zal geschieden.  

### Artikel  6  

Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij voorziet in het verlenen van uitkeringen in natura aan elke zich op het grondgebied van deze Partij bevindende arbeider ongeacht nationaliteit of sociale verzekering en, hetzij in het algemeen dan wel onder voorbehoud van wederkerigheidsovereenkomsten, ongeacht zijn woonplaats, 

a) heeft elke zich op het grondgebied van deze Partij bevindende arbeider recht op uitkeringen in natura ingevolge de wetgeving van bedoelde Partij;  

b) is geen enkele bepaling uit de artikelen 3 en 4 betreffende de uitkeringen in natura van toepassing op de arbeider die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van deze Partij verzekerd is of die zich op dit grondgebied bevindt;  

c) is bovenbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij gehouden op verzoek van elke andere Partij met deze in onderhandeling te treden, teneinde een overeenkomst te sluiten, welke voorziet in het verlenen van uitkeringen in natura aan arbeiders die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van de ene Partij verzekerd zijn en die zich op het grondgebied van de andere Partij bevinden.    

### Artikel  7  

1.  Wanneer een arbeider die onderworpen is aan de wetgeving van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen overlijdt op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, waar hij zich bevindt voor arbeid als omschreven in artikel 1, onder *h*), van dit Verdrag, wordt het overlijden geacht te hebben plaatsgevonden op het grondgebied van eerstgenoemde Partij voor wat betreft het vaststellen van het recht op de uitkering bij overlijden ten aanzien van de wetgeving van deze Partij. De uitkering bij overlijden kan de aanvrager niet geweigerd worden op grond van het feit dat hij zich niet op bedoeld grondgebied bevond, maar op dat van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het voorgaande lid is van overeenkomstige toepassing wanneer een gezinslid, bedoeld in artikel 3, lid 6, van dit Verdrag, overlijdt op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die, waar het bevoegde orgaan is gevestigd.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Voor de toepassing van de artikelen 3, 4 en 7 van dit Verdrag zijn de arbeiders onderworpen aan de verplichtingen en genieten zij de uitkeringen ingevolge de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij, waarvan zij de nationaliteit niet bezitten, onder dezelfde voorwaarden als de onderdanen van die Partij.   
2.  De in dit Verdrag bedoelde uitkeringen in geld kunnen geen enkele korting ondergaan, noch worden gewijzigd, opgeschort of vervallen verklaard op grond van het feit, dat de arbeider zich voor arbeid als omschreven in artikel 1 onder *h*), bevindt op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan het land waar het bevoegde orgaan is gevestigd.   

### Titel  III  

####Diverse bepalingen

De wederzijdse administratieve bijstand van genoemde autoriteiten en organen geschiedt in beginsel kosteloos; na overleg met de belanghebbende organen kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen echter overeenkomen bepaalde kosten terug te betalen.

In dat geval zal een aldus ingeschakelde autoriteit, orgaan of instelling onverwijld deze aanvragen, verklaringen of beroepschriften doen toekomen aan de autoriteit, het orgaan of de instelling van eerstgenoemde Partij, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door bemiddeling van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen.
