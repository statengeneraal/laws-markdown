##Europese Overeenkomst voor de bescherming van gewervelde dieren die worden gebruikt voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden, zoals gewijzigd door het Protocol tot wijziging

####European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes

Preambule The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Recalling that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members and that it wishes to co-operate with other States in the protection of live animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes; Recognising that man has a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for suffering and memory; Accepting nevertheless that man in his quest for knowledge, health and safety has a need to use animals where there is a reasonable expectation that the result will be to extend knowledge or be to the overall benefit of man or animal, just as he uses them for food, clothing and as beasts of burden; Resolved to limit the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes, with the aim of replacing such use wherever practical, in particular by seeking alternative measures and encouraging the use of these alternative measures; Desirous to adopt common provisions in order to protect animals used in those procedures which may possibly cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and to ensure that where unavoidable they shall be kept to a minimum, Have agreed as follows:     
### PART  I  

####General principles

### Article  1  

1.  This Convention applies to any animal used or intended for use in any experimental or other scientific procedure where that procedure may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. It does not apply to any non-experimental agricultural or clinical veterinary practice.   
2.  In this Convention: 

a. *,,animal",* unless otherwise qualified, means any live non-human vertebrate, including free-living and/or reproducing larval forms, but excluding other foetal or embryonic forms;  

b. *"intended for use"* means bred or kept for the purpose of sale, disposal or use in any experimental or other scientific procedure;  

c. *"procedure"* means any experimental or other scientific use of an animal which may cause it pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, including any course of action intended to, or liable to, result in the birth of an animal in any such conditions, but excluding the least painful methods accepted in modern practice (that is, "humane" methods) of killing or marking an animal. A procedure starts when an animal is first prepared for use and ends when no further observations are to be made for that procedure; the elimination of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm by the successful use of anaesthesia or analgesia or other methods does not place the use of an animal outside the scope of this definition;  

d. *"competent person"* means any person who is considered by a Party to be competent in its territory to perform the relevant function described in this Convention;  

e. *"responsible authority"* means, in the territory of a given Party, any authority, body or person designated for the relevant purpose;  

f. *"establishment"* means any stable or mobile facility, any building, group of buildings or other premises, including a place which is not wholly enclosed or covered;  

g. *"breeding establishment"* means any establishment where animals are bred with a view to their use in procedures;  

h. *"supplying establishment"* means any establishment, other than a breeding establishment, from which animals are supplied with a view to their use in procedures;  

i. *"user establishment"* means any establishment where animals are used in procedures;  

j. *"humane method of killing"* means the killing of an animal with a minimum of physical and mental suffering appropriate to the species.     

### Article  2  

A procedure may be performed for one or more of the following purposes only and subject to the restrictions laid down in this Convention: 

a. 

i. avoidance or prevention of disease, ill-health or other abnormality, or their effects, in man, vertebrate or invertebrate animals or plants, including the production and the quality, efficacy and safety testing of drugs, substances or products;  

ii. diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or other abnormality, or their effects, in man, vertebrate or invertebrate animals or plants;    

b. detection, assessment, regulation or modification of physiological conditions in man, vertebrate and invertebrate animals or plants;  

c. protection of the environment;  

d. scientific research;  

e. education and training;  

f. forensic inquiries.    

### Article  3  

Each Party undertakes to take all the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions of this Convention and to ensure an effective system of control and supervision as soon as possible and in any case within a period of five years from the date of entry into force of the present Convention in respect of that Party.  

### Article  4  

No provision in this Convention shall affect the liberty of the Parties to adopt stricter measures for the protection of animals used in procedures or for the control and restriction of the use of animals in procedures.  

### PART  II  

####General care and accommodation

### Article  5  

1.  Any animal used or intended for use in a procedure shall be provided with accommodation, an environment, at least a minimum degree of freedom of movement, food, water and care, appropriate to its health and well-being. Any restriction on the extent to which an animal can satisfy its physiological and ethological needs shall be limited as far as practicable. In the implementation of this provision, regard should be paid to the guidelines for accommodation and care of animals set out in Appendix A to this Convention.   
2.  The environmental conditions in which animals are bred, kept or used shall be checked daily.   
3.  The well-being and state of health of animals shall be observed sufficiently closely and frequently to prevent pain or avoidable suffering, distress or lasting harm.   
4.  Each Party shall determine arrangements to ensure that any defect or suffering discovered is corrected as quickly as possible.   

### PART  III  

####Conduct of procedure

### Article  6  

1.  A procedure shall not be performed for any of the purposes referred to in Article 2, if another scientifically satisfactory method, not entailing the use of an animal, is reasonably and practicably available.   
2.  Each Party should encourage scientific research into the development of methods which could provide the same information as that obtained in procedures.   

### Article  7  

When a procedure has to be performed, the choice of species shall be carefully considered and, where required, be explained to the responsible authority; in a choice between procedures, those should be selected which use the minimum number of animals, cause the least pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and which are most likely to provide satisfactory results.  

### Article  8  

A procedure shall be performed under general or local anaesthesia or analgesia or by other methods designed to eliminate as far as practicable pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, applied, throughout the procedure unless: 

a. the pain caused by the procedure is less than the impairment of the animal's well-being caused by the use of anaesthesia or analgesia, or  

b. the use of anaesthesia or analgesia is incompatible with the aim of the procedure. In such cases, appropriate legislative and/or administrative measures shall be taken to ensure that no such procedure is carried out unnecessarily.    

### Article  9  

1.  Where it is planned to subject an animal to a procedure in which it will or may experience severe pain which is likely to endure, that procedure must be specifically declared and justified to, or specifically authorised by, the responsible authority.   
2.  Appropriate legislative and/or administrative measures shall be taken to ensure that no such procedure is carried out unnecessarily. Such measures shall include: 

- either specific authorisation by the responsible authority;  

- or specific declaration of such procedure to the responsible authority and judicial or administrative action by that authority if it is not satisfied that the procedure is of sufficient importance for meeting the essential needs of man or animal, including the solution of scientific problems.     

### Article  10  

During a procedure, an animal used shall remain subject to the provisions of Article 5 except where those provisions are incompatible with the objective of the procedure.  

### Article  11  

1.  At the end of a procedure it shall be decided whether the animal shall be kept alive or killed by a humane method. An animal shall not kept alive if, even though it has been restored to normal health in all other respects, it is likely to remain in lasting pain or distress.   
2.  The decisions referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be taken by a competent person, in particular a veterinarian, or the person who, in accordance with Article 13, is responsible for, or has performed, the procedure.   
3.  Where, at the end of a procedure: 

a. an animal is to be kept alive, it shall receive the care appropriate to its state of health, be placed under the supervision of a veterinarian or other competent person and kept under conditions conforming to the requirements of Article 5. The conditions laid down in this sub-paragraph may, however, be waived where, in the opinion of a veterinarian, the animal would not suffer as a consequence of such exemption;  

b. an animal is not to be kept alive or cannot benefit from the provisions of Article 5 for its well-being, it shall be killed by a humane method as soon as possible.     
4.  No animal which has been used in a procedure entailing severe or enduring pain or suffering, irrespective of whether anaesthesia or analgesia was employed, shall be used in a further procedure unless it has returned to good health and well-being, and either: 

a. the further procedure is one in which the animal is subject throughout to general anaesthesia which is to be maintained until the animal is killed; or  

b. the further procedure will involve minor interventions only.     

### Article  12  

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, where it is necessary for the legitimate purposes of the procedure, the responsible authority may allow the animal concerned to be set free provided that it is satisfied that the maximum practicable care has been taken to safeguard the animal's well-being. Procedures that involve setting the animal free shall not be permitted solely for educational or training purposes.  

### PART  IV  

####Authorisation

### Article  13  

A procedure for the purposes referred to in Article 2 may be carried out only by persons authorised, or under the direct responsibility of a person authorised, or if the experimental or other scientific project concerned is authorised in accordance with the provisions of national legislation. Authorisation shall be granted only to persons deemed to be competent by the responsible authority.  

### PART  V

3.  The responsible authority shall prescribe the records which are to be kept and made available to it by the person in charge of the establishments mentioned in paragraph 1 and 2 of this article; such records shall be kept for a minimum of three years from the date of the last entry.   

### Article  17  

1.  Each dog and cat in an establishment shall be individually and permanently marked in the least painful manner possible before it is weaned.   
2.  Where an unmarked dog or cat is taken into an establishment for the first time after it has been weaned, it shall be marked as soon as possible.   
3.  Where a dog or cat is transferred from one establishment to another before it is weaned and it is not practical to mark it beforehand, a full documentary record, specifying in particular its mother, shall be kept until it can be marked.   
4.  Particulars of the identity and origin of each dog or cat shall be entered in the records of the establishment.   

### Article  18  

User establishments shall be registered with or otherwise approved by the responsible authority and shall comply with the conditions laid down in Article 5.  

### Article  19  

Provisions shall be made at user establishments for installations and equipment appropriate for the species of animals used and the performance of the procedures conducted there. The design, construction and functioning of such installations and equipment shall be such as to ensure that the procedures are performed as effectively as possible, with the object to obtaining consistent results with the minimum number of animals and the minimum degree of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.  

### Article  20  

In user establishments: 

a. the person or persons who are administratively responsible for the care of the animals and the functioning of the equipment shall be identified;  

b. sufficient trained staff shall be provided;

### *Introduction* 

1. The member States of the Council of Europe have decided that it is their aim to protect live animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes to ensure that any possible pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm inflicted upon them, as a consequence of procedures being conducted upon them, shall be kept at a minimum.  

2. It is true that some procedures are conducted under field conditions on free-living, self-supporting, wild animals, but such procedures are relatively few in number. The great majority of animals used in procedures must for practical reasons be kept under some sort of physical control in facilities ranging from outdoor corrals to cages for small animals in a laboratory animal house. This is a situation where there are highly conflicting interests. On the one hand, the animal whose needs in respect of movement, social relations and other manifestations of life must be restricted, on the other hand, the experimenter and his assistants who demand full control of the animal and its environment. In this confrontation of interests the animal may sometimes be given secondary consideration.  

3. Therefore, the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental or Other Scientific Purposes provides in Article 5 that: "Any animal used for intended for use in a procedure shall be provided with accommodation, an environment, at least a minimum degree of freedom of movement, food, water and care, appropriate to its health and well-being. Any restriction on the extent to which an animal can satisfy its physiological and ethological needs shall be limited as far as practicable."  

4. This appendix draws up certain guidelines based on present knowledge and practice for the accommodation and care of animals. It explains and supplements the basic principles adopted in Article 5. The object is thus to help authorities, institutions and individuals in their pursuit of the aims of the Council of Europe in this matter.  

5. Care is a word which, when used in connection with animals intended for or in actual use in procedures, covers all aspects of the relationship between animals and man. Its substance is the sum of material and non-material resources mobilised by man to obtain and maintain an animal in a physical and mental state where it suffers least and performs best in procedures. It starts from the moment the animal is destined to be used in procedures and continues until it is humanely killed or otherwise disposed of by the establishment in accordance with Article 11 of the Convention after the close of the procedure.  

6. The appendix aims to give advice about the design of appropriate animal quarters. There are, however, several methods of breeding and keeping laboratory animals that differ chiefly in the degree of control of the microbiological environment. It has to be borne in mind that the staff concerned will sometimes have to judge from the character and condition of the animals where the recommended standards of space may not be sufficient, as with especially aggressive animals. In applying the guidelines described in this appendix, the requirements of each of these situations should be taken into account. Furthermore, it is necessary to make clear the status of these guidelines. Unlike the provisions of the Convention itself, they are not mandatory: they are recommendations to be used with discretion, designed as guidance to the practices and standards which all concerned should conscientiously strive to achieve. It is for this reason that the term "should" has had to be used throughout the text even where "must" might seem to be the more appropriate word. For example, it is self-evident that food and water *must* be provided (see 3.7.2 and 3.8).  

7. Finally, for practical and financial reasons, existing animal quarters equipment should not need to be replaced before it is worn out, or has otherwise become useless. Pending replacement with equipment conforming with the present guidelines, these should as far as practicable be complied with by adjusting the numbers and sizes of animals placed in existing cages and pens.   
### *Definitions* 

In this Appendix A, in addition to the definitions contained in Article 1.2 of the Convention: 

a. *"holding rooms"* means rooms where animals are normally housed, either for breeding and stocking or during the conduct of a procedure;  

b. *"cage"* means a permanently fixed or movable container that is closed by solid walls and, at least on one side, by bars or meshed wire or, where appropriate, nets and in which one or more animals are kept or transported; depending on the stocking density and the size of the container, the freedom of movement of the animals is relatively restricted;  

c. *"pen"* means an area enclosed, for example, by walls, bars or meshed wire in which one or more animals are kept; depending on the size of the enclosure and the stocking density the freedom of movement of the animals is usually less restricted than in a cage;  

d. *"run"* means an area closed, for example, by fences, walls, bars or meshed wire and frequently situated outside permanently fixed buildings in which animals kept in cages or pens can move freely during certain periods of time in accordance with their ethological and physiological needs, such as exercise;  

e. *"stall"* means a small enclosure with three sides, usually a feed-rack and lateral separations, where one or two animals may be kept tethered.   
### *1. The physical facilities* 

1.1.  *Functions and general design*  

1.1.1. Any facility should be so constructed as to provide a suitable environment for the species housed. It should also be designed to prevent access by unauthorised persons. Facilities that are part of a larger building complex should also be protected by proper building measures and arrangements that limit the number of entrances and prevent unauthorised traffic.  

1.1.2. It is recommended that there should be a maintenance programme for the facilities in order to prevent any defect of equipment.    

1.2.  *Holding rooms*  

1.2.1. All necessary measures should be taken to ensure regular and efficient cleaning of the rooms and the maintenance of a satisfactory hygienic standard. Ceilings and walls should be damage-resistant with a smooth, impervious and easily washable surface. Special attention should be paid to junctions with doors, ducts, pipes and cables. Doors and windows, if any, should be constructed or protected so as to keep out unwanted animals. Where appropriate, an inspection window may be fitted in the door. Floors should be smooth, impervious and have a non-slippery, easily washable surface which can carry the weight of racks and other heavy equipment without being damaged. Drains, if any, should be adequately covered and fitted with a barrier which will prevent animals from gaining access.  

1.2.2. Rooms where the animals are allowed to run freely should have walls and floors with a particularly resistant surface material to stand up to the heavy wear and tear caused by the animals and the cleaning process. The material should not be detrimental to the health of the animals and be such that the animals cannot hurt themselves. Drains are desirable in such rooms. Additional protection must be given to any equipment or fixtures so that they may not be damaged by the animals or hurt the animals themselves. Where outdoor exercise areas are provided measures should be taken when appropriate to prevent access by the public and animals.  

1.2.3. Rooms intended for the holding of farm animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, poultry, etc) should at least conform with the standards laid down in the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes and by national veterinary and other authorities.  

1.2.4. The majority of holing rooms are usually designed to house rodents. Frequently such rooms may also be used to house larger species. Care should be taken not to house together species which are incompatible.  

1.2.5. Holding rooms should be provided with facilities for carrying out minor procedures and manipulations, where appropriate.    

1.3.  *Laboratories and general and special purpose procedure rooms*  

1.3.1. At breeding or supplying establishments suitable facilities for making consignments of animals ready for dispatch should be made available.  

1.3.2. All establishments should also have available as a minimum laboratory facilities for the carrying out of simple diagnostic tests, post-mortem examinations, and/or the collection of samples which are to be subjected to more extensive laboratory investigations elsewhere.  

1.3.3. Provision should be made for the receipt of animals in such a way that incoming animals do not put at risk animals already present in the facility, for example by quarantining. General and special purpose procedure rooms should be available for situations where it is undesirable to carry out the procedures or observations in the holding room.  

1.3.4. There should be appropriate accommodation for enabling animals which are ill or injured to be housed separately.  

1.3.5. Where appropriate, there should be provision for one or more separate operating rooms suitably equipped for the performance of surgical procedures under aseptic conditions. There should be facilities for post-operative recovery where this is warranted.    

1.4.  *Service rooms*  

1.4.1. Store rooms for food should be cool, dry, vermin and insect proof and those for bedding, dry, vermin and insect proof. Other materials, which may be contaminated or present a hazard, should be stored separately.  

1.4.2. Store rooms for clean cages, instruments and other equipment should be available.  

1.4.3. The cleaning and washing room should be large enough to accommodate the installations necessary to decontaminate and clean used equipment. The cleaning process should be arranged so as to separate the flow of clean and dirty equipment to prevent the contamination of newly cleaned equipment. Walls and floors should be covered with a suitably resistant surface material and the ventilation system should have ample capacity to carry away the excess heat and humidity.  

1.4.4. Provision should be made for the hygienic storage and disposal of carcasses and animal waste. If incineration on the site is not possible or desirable, suitable arrangements should be made for the safe disposal of such material having regard to local regulations and by-laws. Special precautions should be taken with highly toxic or radioactive waste.  

1.4.5. The design and construction of circulation areas should correspond to the standards of the holding rooms. The corridors should be wide enough to allow easy circulation of movable equipment.     
### *2. The environment in the holding rooms and its control* 

2.1.  *Ventilation*  

2.1.1. Holding rooms should have an adequate ventilation system which should satisfy the requirements of the species housed. The purpose of the ventilation system is to provide fresh air and to keep down the level of odours, noxious gases, dust and infectious agents of any kind. It also provides for the removal of excess heat and humidity.  

2.1.2. The air in the room should be renewed at frequent intervals. A ventilation rate of 15-20 air changes per hour is normally adequate. However, in some circumstances, where stocking density is low, 8-10 air changes per hour may suffice or mechanical ventilation may not even be needed at all. Other circumstances may necessitate a much higher rate of air change. Recirculation of untreated air should be avoided. However, it should be emphasised that even the most efficient system cannot compensate for poor cleaning routines or negligence.  

2.1.3. The ventilation system should be so designed as to avoid harmful draughts.  

2.1.4. Smoking in rooms where there are animals should be forbidden.    

2.2.  *Temperature*  

2.2.1. Table 1 gives the range within which it is recommended that the temperature should be maintained. It should also be emphasised that the figures apply only to adult, normal animals. Newborn and young animals will often require a much higher temperature level. The temperature of the premises should be regulated according to possible changes in the animals' thermal regulation which may be due to special physiological conditions or to the effects of the procedures.  

2.2.2. Under the climatic conditions prevailing in Europe it may be necessary to provide a ventilation system having the capacity both to heat and to cool the air supplied.  

2.2.3. In user establishments a precise temperature control in the holding rooms may be required, because the environmental temperature is a physical factor which has a profound effect on the metabolism of all animals.    

2.3.  *Humidity*  Extreme variations in relative humidity (RH) have an adverse effect on the health and well-being of animals. It is therefore recommended that the RH level in holding rooms should be appropriate to the species concerned and should ordinarily be maintained at 55% ± 10%. Values below 40% and above 70% RH for prolonged periods should be avoided.  

2.4.  *Lighting*  In windowless rooms, it is necessary to provide controlled lighting both to satisfy the biological requirements of the animals and to provide a satisfactory working environment. It is also necessary to have a control of the intensity and of the light-dark cycle. When keeping albino animals, one should take into account their sensitivity to light (see also 2.6).  

2.5.  *Noise*  Noise can be an important disturbing factor in the animal quarters. Holding rooms and procedure rooms should be insulated against loud noise sources in the audible and in the higher frequencies in order to avoid disturbances in the behaviour and the physiology of the animals. Sudden noises may lead to considerable change in organ functions but, as they are often unavoidable, it is sometimes advisable to provide holding and procedure rooms with a continuous sound of moderate intensity such as soft music.  

2.6.  *Alarm systems*  A facility housing a large number of animals is vulnerable. It is therefore recommended that the facility is duly protected by the installation of devices to detect fires and the intrusion of unauthorised persons. Technical defects or a break-down of the ventilation system is another hazard which could cause distress and even the death of animals, due to suffocation and overheating or, in less serious cases, have such negative effects on a procedure that it will be a failure and have to be repeated. Adequate monitoring devices should therefore be installed in connection with the heating and ventilation plant to enable the staff to supervise its operation in general. If warranted, a stand-by generator should be provided for the maintenance of life support systems for the animals and lighting in the event of a break-down or the withdrawal of supply. Clear instructions on emergency procedures should be prominently displayed. Alarms for fish tanks are recommended in case of failure of the water supply. Care should be taken to ensure that the operation of an alarm system causes as little disturbance as possible to the animals.   
### *3. Care* 

3.1.  *Health*  

3.1.1. The person in charge of the establishment should ensure regular inspection of the animals and supervision of the accommodation and care by a veterinarian or other competent person.  

3.1.2. According to the assessment of the potential hazard to the animals, appropriate attention should be paid to the health and hygiene of the staff.    

3.2.  *Capture*  Wild and feral animals should be captured only by humane methods and by experienced persons who have a thorough knowledge of the habits and habitats of the animals to be caught. If an anaesthetic or any other drug has to be used in the capturing operation, it should be administered by a veterinarian or other competent person. Any animal which is seriously injured should be presented as soon as possible to a veterinarian for treatment. If the animal, in the opinion of the veterinarian, can only go on living with suffering or pain it should be killed at once by a humane method. In the absence of a veterinarian, any animal which may be seriously injured should be killed at once by a humane method.  

3.3.  *Packing and transport conditions*  All transportation is undoubtedly, for the animals, a stressful experience, which should be mitigated as far as possible. Animals should be in good health for transportation and it is the duty of the sender to ensure that they are so. Animals which are sick or otherwise out of condition should never be subjected to any transport which is not necessary for therapeutic or diagnostic reasons. Special care should be exercised with female animals in an advanced state of pregnancy. Female animals which are likely to give birth during the transport or which have done so within the preceding forty-eight hours, and their offspring, should be excluded from transportation. Every precaution should be taken by sender and carrier in packing, stowing and transit to avoid unnecessary suffering through inadequate ventilation, exposure to extreme temperatures, lack of feed and water, long delays, etc. The receiver should be properly informed about the transport details and documentary particulars to ensure quick handling and reception in the place of arrival. Even in the case of States which are not Parties to the European Convention on the Protection of Animals During International Transport, strict observance of the provisions of this Convention is recommended; strict observance of national laws and regulations as well as of the regulations for live animals of the International Air Transport Association and the Animal Air Transport Association is also recommended.  

3.4.  *Reception and unpacking*  The consignments of animals should be received and unpacked without avoidable delay. After inspection, the animals should be transferred to clean cages or pens and be supplied with feed and water as appropriate. Animals which are sick or otherwise out of condition should be kept under close observation and separately from other animals. They should be examined by a veterinarian or other competent person as soon as possible and, where necessary, treated. Animals which do not have any chance to recover should be killed at once by a humane method. Finally, all animals received must be registered and marked in accordance with the provisions of Articles 16, 17 and 24 of the Convention. Transport boxes should be destroyed immediately if proper decontamination is impossible.  

3.5.  *Quarantine, isolation and acclimatisation*  

3.5.1. The objects of quarantine are: 

a. to protect other animals in the establishment;  

b. to protect man against zoonotic infection;  

c. to foster good scientific practice.   Unless the state of health of animals introduced into an establishment is satisfactory, it is recommended that they should undergo a period of quarantine. In some cases, that of rabies, for example, this period may be laid down in the national regulations of the Party. In others, it will vary and should be determined by a competent person, according to the circumstances, normally the veterinarian appointed by the establishment (see also Table 2). Animals may be used for procedures during the quarantine period as long as they have become acclimatised to their new environment and they present no significant risk to other animals or man.  

3.5.2. It is recommended that facilities should be set aside in which to isolate animals showing signs of or suspected of ill-health and which might present a hazard to man or to other animals.  

3.5.3. Even when the animals are seen to be in sound health it is good husbandry for them to undergo a period of acclimatisation before being used in a procedure. The time required depends on several factors, such as the stress to which the animals have been subjected which in turn depends on several factors such as the duration of the transportation and the age of the animal. This time shall be decided by a competent person.    

3.6.  *Caging*  

3.6.1. It is possible to make a distinction between two broad systems of housing animals. Firstly, there is the system found in breeding, supplying and user establishments in the bio-medical field designed to accommodate animals such as rodents, rabbits, carnivores, birds and non-human primates, sometimes also ruminants, swine and horses. Suggested guidelines for cages, pens, runs and stalls suitable for such facilities are presented in Tables 3 to 13. Supplementary guidance on minimum cage areas is found in Figures 1 to 7. Furthermore, a corresponding guidance for the appraisal of the stocking density in cages is presented in Figures 8 to 12. Secondly, there is the system frequently found in establishments conducting procedures only on farm or similar large animals. The facilities in such establishments should not be less than those required by current veterinary standards.  

3.6.2. Cages and pens should not be made out of material that is detrimental to the health of the animals, and their design should be such that the animals cannot injure themselves and, unless they are disposable, they should be made from a resistant material adapted to cleaning and decontamination techniques. In particular attention should be given to the design of cage and pen floors which should vary according to the species and age of the animals and be designed to facilitate the removal of excreta.  

3.6.3. Pens should be designed for the well-being of the species. They should permit the satisfaction of certain ethological needs (for example the need to climb, hide or shelter temporarily) and be designed for efficient cleaning and freedom from contact with other animals.    

3.7.  *Feeding*  

3.7.1. In the selection, production and preparation of feed, precautions should be taken to avoid chemical, physical and microbiological contamination. The feed should be packed in tight, closed bags, stamped with the production date when appropriate. Packing, transport and storing should also be such as to avoid contamination, deterioration or destruction. Store rooms should be cool, dark, dry, and vermin and insect proof. Quickly perishable feed like greens, vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, etc. should be stored in cold rooms, refrigerators or freezers. All feed hoppers, troughs or other utensils used for feeding should be regularly cleaned and if necessary sterilised. If moist feed is used or if the feed is easily contaminated with water, urine, etc., daily cleaning is necessary.  

3.7.2. The feed distribution process may vary according to the species but it should be such as to satisfy the physiological needs of the animal. Provision should be made for each animal to have access to the feed.    

3.8.  *Water*  

3.8.1. Uncontaminated drinking water should always be available to all animals. During transport, it is acceptable to provide water as part of a moist diet. Water is however a vehicle of micro-organisms and the supply should therefore be so arranged that the hazard involved is minimised. Two methods are in common use, bottles and automatic systems.  

3.8.2. Bottles are often used with small animals like rodents and rabbits. When bottles are used, they should be made from translucent material in order to enable their contents to be monitored. The design should be wide-mouthed for easy and efficient cleaning and, if plastic material is used, it should not be leachable. Caps, stoppers and pipes should also be sterilisable and easy to clean. All bottles and accessories should be taken to pieces, cleaned and sterilised at appropriate and regular periods. It is preferable that the bottles should be replaced by clean, sterilised ones rather than be refilled in the holding rooms.  

3.8.3. Automatic drinking systems should be regularly checked, serviced and flushed to avoid accidents and the spread of infections. If solid-bottom cages are used, care should be taken to minimise the risk of flooding. Regular bacteriological testing of the system is also necessary to monitor the quality of the water.  

3.8.4. Water received from public waterworks contains some micro-organisms which are usually considered to be harmless unless one is dealing with microbiologically defined animals. In such cases, the water should be treated. Water supplied by public waterworks is usually chlorinated to reduce the growth of micro-organisms. Such chlorination is not always enough to keep down the growth of certain potential pathogens, as for example Pseudomonas. As an additional measure, the level of chlorine in the water could be increased or the water could be acidified to achieve the desired effect.  

3.8.5. In fishes, amphibians and reptiles, tolerance for acidity, chlorine and many other chemicals differs widely from species to species. Therefore provision should be made to adapt the water supply for aquariums and tanks to the needs and tolerance limits of the individual species.    

3.9.  *Bedding*  Bedding should be dry, absorbent, non-dusty, non-toxic and free from infectious agents or vermin, or any other form of contamination. Special care should be taken to avoid using sawdust or bedding material derived from wood which has been treated chemically. Certain industrial by-products or waste, such as shredded paper, may be used.  

3.10.  *Exercising and handling*  

3.10.1. It is advisable to take every possible opportunity to let animals take exercise.  

3.10.2 The performance of an animal during a procedure depends very much on its confidence in man, something which has to be developed. The wild or feral animal will probably never become an ideal experimental animal. It is different with the domesticated animal born and raised in contact with man. The confidence once established should however be preserved. It is therefore recommended that frequent contact should be maintained so that the animals become familiar with human presence and activity. Where appropriate, time should be set aside for taking, handling and grooming. The staff should be sympathetic, gentle and firm when associating with the animals.    

3.11.  *Cleaning*  

3.11.1. The standard of a facility depends very much on good hygiene. Clear instructions should be given for the changing of bedding in cages and pens.  

3.11.2. Adequate routines for the cleaning, washing, decontamination and, when necessary, sterilisation of cages and accessories, bottles and other equipment should be established. A very high standard of cleanliness and order should also be maintained in holding, washing and storage rooms.  

3.11.3. There should be regular cleaning and, where appropriate, renewal of the material forming the ground surface in outdoor pens, cages and runs to avoid them becoming a source of infection and parasite infestation.    

3.12.  *Humane killing of animals*  

3.12.1. All humane methods of killing animals require expertise which can only be attained by appropriate training.  

3.12.2. A deeply unconscious animal can be exsanguinated but drugs which paralyse muscles before unconsciousness occurs, those with curariform effects and electrocution without passage of current through the brain, should not be used without prior anaesthesia.   Carcass disposal should not be allowed until *rigor mortis* occurs.

*Note:* "Cage height" means the vertical distance between the cage floor and the upper horizontal part of the lid or cage. When designing procedures, consideration should be given to the potential growth of the animals to ensure adequate room according to this table in all phases of the procedures. See also Figures 1 to 5 and 8 to 12.

*Note:* The housing of cats in cages should be strictly limited. Cats confined in this way should be let out for exercising at least once a day, where it does not interfere with the procedure. Cat pens should be equipped with dirt trays, ample shelf room for resting and objects suitable for climbing and clawtrimming. "Cage height" means the vertical distance between the highest point on the floor and the lowest point in the top of the cage. For the purpose of calculating the minimum floor area, the shelf area may be included. The minimum cage floor area per queen and litter includes the 0,18 m <sup>2</sup> area of the kittening box. See also Figure 7.

*Note:* Dogs should not be kept in cages any longer than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of the procedure. Caged dogs should be let out for exercise at least once a day unless it is incompatible with the purpose of the procedure. A time-limit should be set beyond which a dog should not be confined without daily exercise. Exercise areas should be large enough to allow the dog freedom of movement. Grid floors should not be used in dog cages unless the procedure requires it. In the light of the great differences in height and the limited interdependence of height and weight of various breeds of dogs, the cage height should be based on the body height to the shoulder of the individual animal. As a general rule the minimum cage height should be twice the height to the shoulder. For definition of "cage height", see note to Table 6.

*Note:* Figures in brackets give the total area per dog, that is, the pen floor area plus the adjacent exercise area. Dogs kept permanently outdoors should have access to a sheltered place to find protection against unfavourable weather conditions. Where dogs are housed on grid floors, a solid area should be provided for sleeping. Grid floors should not be used unless the procedure requires it. Partitions between pens should be such as to prevent dogs from injuring each other. All pens should have adequate drainage. 
###TABLE 9

*Guidelines for caging non-human primates (in stock and during procedures and breeding)*  *Introductory note:* Because of the wide variations in sizes and characteristics of primates, it is especially important to match the shape and internal fittings as well as the dimensions of their cages to their particular needs. The total volume of the cage is just as important to primates as the floor area. As a general principle, the height of a cage, at least for apes and other simians, should be its greatest dimension. Cages should be high enough at least to allow the animals to stand up erect. The minimum cage height for brachiators should be such as to allow them to swing in full extension from the ceiling without their feet touching the cage floor. Where appropriate, perches should be fitted to allow the primates to use the upper part of the cage. Compatible primates may be kept two to a cage. Where they cannot be kept in pairs, their cages should be so placed that they can see one another, but it should also be possible to prevent this when required. Subject to these observations, the following table constitutes a general guideline for caging the groups of species most commonly used (superfamilies *Ceboidea* and *Cercopithecoidea).*

### Appendix  B  

####Statistical tables and Explanatory notes for their completion in fulfilment of the requirements in Articles 27 and 28 of the Convention

### *Introduction* 

Under Articles 27 and 28 of the Convention, each Party shall collect statistical information relating to certain aspects of procedures coming under the Convention and communicate this information to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe who shall publish the information received. The method used to collect the information is for each Party to decide and, of course, any additional statistical information may be collected to satisfy national requirements. However, in order to facilitate the work of the Secretary General, the information supplied to him must be comparable and in accordance with the attached tables. Data shall be collected per calendar year. 
### *General* 

The animals to be counted are those which will be put to a use which may cause them pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm (see Article 1.2.c of the Convention). The counting shall take place when the animals are put to use in a procedure. Each animal shall be counted once only in the same table. Animals not subject to procedures as defined in Article 1.2.c shall not be counted for the purpose of collecting statistical information in the context of this Convention. The very nature of biological research makes it inevitable that occasions will arise when it is difficult to decide in which column of a table an animal being used in a procedure should be recorded. There is no right or wrong method of solving the problem, which is one of individual choice. Subject to such directives as the competent authorities may give, it is for the scientist to decide where to record his animal.  *It is, however, essential to ensure that no animal is counted twice in the same table.*  
### *Table 1* 

### *The number and kinds of animals used in procedures* 

In this table the total number of animals used in procedures shall be given, this total being broken down by types or classes of animal. 
### *Table 2* 

### *The number of animals used in procedures for selected purposes* 

This table is intended to show the number of animals used in the broad areas of: fundamental research, development of new products, safety evaluation, diagnosis of disease, and education and training. In column 1, "medical" includes veterinary medicine. 
### *Table 3* 

### *The number of animals used in procedures for selected purposes for the protection of man, animals and the environment by toxicological or other safety evaluations* 

This table is intended to give a more detailed breakdown of procedures carried out for the general protection of man, animals and the environment excluding medical purposes. Column 6 includes harmful radiation. 
### *Table 4* 

### *The number of animals used in procedures concerned with diseases and disorders* 

This table is intended to illustrate the number of animals used for medical purposes, including veterinary medicine, with special reference to three areas of human disease which are of particular public concern. 
### *Table 5* 

### *The number of animals used in procedures required by law* 

An entry in the column "Party only" shall be made when the procedure is required by the law of the Party in which the procedure takes place, including international obligations into which that Party has entered (for example as a Party to the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia or as a member State of the European Communities). An entry in the column "Other Parties only" shall be made where the aim of the procedure is specifically to meet requirements, including trade requirements, in countries other than the Party, including also requirements of conventions to which the latter is not a party. "Both" shall be used where the procedure is intended to meet requirements of both groups; in this case no entry shall be made in either of the other two columns.

####Europese Overeenkomst voor de bescherming van gewervelde dieren die worden gebruikt voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden

Preambule De lidstaten van de Raad van Europa, die deze Overeenkomst hebben ondertekend; Eraan herinnerend dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn leden en dat de Raad wenst samen te werken met andere Staten bij de bescherming van levende dieren die worden gebruikt voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden; Erkennend dat de mens de morele plicht heeft alle dieren te respecteren en voldoende rekening dient te houden met het feit dat zij pijn kunnen lijden en een herinneringsvermogen bezitten; Aanvaardend evenwel dat de mens in zijn streven naar kennis, gezondheid en veiligheid er behoefte aan heeft dieren te gebruiken, indien er een redelijke verwachting bestaat dat het resultaat een verruiming van kennis zal opleveren of ten goede zal komen aan mens en dier in het algemeen, evenals hij dieren gebruikt voor voedsel, kleding en als lastdier; Vastbesloten het gebruik van dieren voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden te beperken, met als doel de mogelijke vervanging van dit gebruik, in het bijzonder door onderzoek naar en bevordering van de toepassing van alternatieve methoden; Verlangend gemeenschappelijke bepalingen te aanvaarden met het doel de dieren te beschermen die worden gebruikt bij procedures waarbij pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel kan worden berokkend en om te waarborgen dat deze procedures, indien ze onvermijdelijk zijn, tot een minimum beperkt blijven; Zijn als volgt overeengekomen:     
### DEEL  I  

####Algemene principes

### Artikel  1  

1.  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op elk dier dat wordt gebruikt of is bestemd voor gebruik in enige experimentele of andere wetenschappelijke procedure, welke pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel teweeg kan brengen. Zij is niet van toepassing op niet-experimenteel agrarisch of clinisch veterinair gebruik.   
2.  In het verband van deze Overeenkomst verstaat men onder: 

a. *„dier”:* zonder andere aanduiding, ieder levend niet-menselijk gewerveld dier, met inbegrip van vrij-levende en/of tot voortplanting in staat zijnde larvale vormen, maar met uitzondering van andere foetale of embryonale vormen;  

b. *„bestemd voor gebruik”:* gefokt of gehouden voor de verkoop, het beschikbaar stellen voor of het gebruik in een experimentele of andere wetenschappelijke procedure;  

c. *„procedure”:* elk experimenteel of ander wetenschappelijk gebruik van een dier dat bij dat dier pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel kan veroorzaken, met inbegrip van iedere ingreep welke resulteert, of waarvan is te verwachten dat deze resulteert in de geboorte van een dier in zulke omstandigheden, maar met uitzondering van de minst pijnlijke methoden, aanvaard in de huidige praktijk (ook wel „humane” methoden), om een dier te doden of te merken. Een procedure vangt aan op het moment waarop het dier voor de eerste maal voor gebruik wordt voorbereid en eindigt wanneer geen verdere waarneming meer behoeft te worden gedaan ten behoeve van die procedure. Het uitschakelen van pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel door een doelmatige toepassing van anaesthesie of analgesie of van andere methoden op het dier plaatsen het gebruik van een dier niet buiten het toepassingsbereik van deze definitie;  

d. *„deskundige”:* iedere persoon die door een Partij binnen zijn grondgebied deskundig geacht wordt om de hem toegewezen functie, omschreven in deze Overeenkomst, te vervullen;  

e. *„verantwoordelijke autoriteit”:* op het grondgebied van de betrokken Partij, iedere autoriteit, ieder lichaam of iedere persoon, aangewezen voor het bepaalde doel;  

f. *„instelling”:iedere* installatie, permanent of mobiel, elk gebouw, groep gebouwen of andere localiteiten, met inbegrip van een niet geheel omsloten of overdekte plaats;  

g. „ *fokinstelling”:* iedere instelling waar dieren worden gefokt met het oog op hun gebruik in procedures;  

h. *„toeleverende instelling”:* iedere instelling, anders dan een fokinstelling, welke dieren levert met het oog op hun gebruik in procedures;  

i. *„gebruikende instelling”:* iedere instelling waar dieren worden gebruikt in procedures;  

j. *„humane methode van doden”:* het doden van een dier met een minimum aan fysiek en mentaal lijden, gelet op de soort.     

### Artikel  2  

Een procedure mag alleen worden verricht ten behoeve van één of meer van de volgende doelstellingen en onder de beperkingen vastgelegd in deze Overeenkomst: 

a. 

i. het vermijden of voorkomen van ziekten, slechte gezondheid of andere afwijkingen, of van de gevolgen daarvan, bij de mens, bij gewervelde of ongewervelde dieren, of bij planten, met inbegrip van het onderzoek naar de kwaliteit, doelmatigheid en veiligheid van geneesmiddelen, stoffen of produkten en hun productie;  

ii. de diagnose of de behandeling van ziekten, slechte gezondheid of andere afwijkingen, of de gevolgen daarvan, bij de mens, bij gewervelde of ongewervelde dieren of bij planten;    

b. het onderkennen, beoordelen, reguleren of wijzigen van de fysiologische gesteldheid van de mens, van gewervelde en ongewervelde dieren en van planten;  

c. de bescherming van het milieu;  

d. wetenschappelijk onderzoek;  

e. onderwijs en opleiding;  

f. forensisch onderzoek.    

### Artikel  3  

Iedere Partij verbindt zich, zo spoedig mogelijk en in ieder geval binnen een periode van vijf jaar vanaf de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst, alle maatregelen te nemen, nodig om uitvoering te geven aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en om een doeltreffend systeem van controle en toezicht te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  4  

Geen enkele bepaling van deze Overeenkomst tast de vrijheid van Partijen aan striktere maatregelen te treffen ter bescherming van dieren gebruikt in procedures of ter controle op en ter beperking van het gebruik van dieren in procedures.  

### DEEL  II  

####Algemene verzorging en huisvesting der dieren

### Artikel  5  

1.  Elk dier, gebruikt of bestemd voor gebruik in een procedure, krijgt een onderkomen, een omgeving, ten minste een zekere bewegingsvrijheid, voedsel, water en verzorging passend bij zijn gezondheid en zijn welzijn. Iedere beperking van de mate waarin het dier aan zijn fysiologische en ethologische behoeften kan voldoen, dient zo gering mogelijk te zijn. Bij de naleving van deze bepaling ware acht te slaan op de richtlijnen voor huisvesting en verzorging van dieren, vervat in Bijlage A bij deze Overeenkomst.   
2.  De omstandigheden van de omgeving, waarin dieren worden gefokt, gehouden of gebruikt, dienen dagelijks te worden gecontroleerd.   
3.  Het welzijn en de gezondheidstoestand van de dieren dienen geobserveerd te worden met voldoende nauwkeurigheid en frequentie om pijn, onnodig lijden, angst of blijvend letsel te voorkomen.   
4.  Iedere Partij dient de maatregelen te treffen noodzakelijk voor het op zo kort mogelijke termijn ongedaan maken van ieder geconstateerd gebrek of lijden.   

### DEEL  III  

####Het verrichten van procedures

### Artikel  6  

1.  Een procedure mag niet worden verricht voor enige doelstelling, genoemd in artikel 2, indien een andere wetenschappelijk bevredigende methode redelijkerwijs en practisch gezien voor handen is, welke niet het gebruik van een dier met zich brengt.   
2.  Iedere Partij zou het wetenschappelijk onderzoek moeten aanmoedigen naar de ontwikkeling van methoden, die dezelfde informatie zouden kunnen verschaffen als die verkregen in procedures.   

### Artikel  7  

Wanneer een procedure moet worden verricht, dient de keuze van de soort zorgvuldig overwogen te worden en, idien vereist, dient de motivering uiteengezet te worden aan de verantwoordelijke autoriteit; bij een keuze tussen procedures dienen die gekozen te worden, die het kleinste aantal dieren gebruiken, het minste pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel veroorzaken en die, naar verwachting, de meest bevredigende resultaten opleveren.  

### Artikel  8  

Een procedure dient te worden verricht onder algehele of plaatselijke anaesthesie of analgesie of middels andere methoden gericht op het zoveel mogelijk uitschakelen van pijn, lijden, angst of blijvend letsel, toegepast gedurende de gehele procedure, tenzij: 

a. de pijn veroorzaakt door de procedure minder is dan de verstoring van het welzijn van het dier veroorzaakt door de toepassing van anaesthesie of analgesie, of  

b. de toepassing van anaesthesie of analgesie onverenigbaar is met het doel van de procedure. In een dergelijk geval dienen passende wettelijke en/of administratieve maatregelen getroffen te worden om te verzekeren dat een dergelijke procedure niet onnodig wordt verricht.    

### Artikel  9  

1.  Waar het voornemen bestaat een dier te onderwerpen aan een procedure waarin het hevige pijn zal of kan ervaren, welke waarschijnlijk zal aanhouden, moet die procedure uitdrukkelijk worden aangemeld bij en gerechtvaardigd tegenover, of uitdrukkelijk worden toegestaan door de verantwoordelijke autoriteit.   
2.  Passende wettelijke en/of administratieve maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen om te verzekeren dat een dergelijke procedure niet onnodig wordt uitgevoerd. Zulke maatregelen dienen te omvatten: 

- ofwel uitdrukkelijke toestemming door de verantwoordelijke autoriteit;  

- danwel uitdrukkelijk aanmelden van zo'n procedure bij de verantwoordelijke autoriteit en gerechtelijk of administratief ingrijpen door die autoriteit indien hij niet overtuigd is dat de procedure voldoende belangrijk is voor de essentiële behoeften van mens of dier, met inbegrip van de oplossing van wetenschappelijke problemen.     

### Artikel  10  

Gedurende een procedure blijft ieder dier dat daarbij wordt gebruikt, onderworpen aan de bepalingen van artikel 5, behalve wanneer die bepalingen onverenigbaar zijn met het doel van de procedure.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Aan het einde van een procedure dient te worden beslist of het dier in leven zal worden gehouden of zal worden gedood volgens een humane methode. Een dier zal niet in leven worden gelaten, zelfs al is zijn gezondheidstoestand hersteld tot normaal in alle andere opzichten, indien het waarschijnlijk is, dat het blijvend pijn of angst zal ondervinden.   
2.  De beslissingen, bedoeld in lid 1 van dit artikel, dienen te worden genomen door een deskundige, in het bijzonder een dierenarts, of door de persoon, die krachtens artikel 13 verantwoordelijk is voor de procedure, of deze heeft uitgevoerd.   
3.  Wanneer, na afloop van een procedure: 

a. een dier in leven dient te worden gehouden, dient het de verzorging te ontvangen passend bij zijn gezondheidstoestand, onder toezicht gesteld te worden van een dierenarts of een andere deskundige en te worden gehouden onder omstandigheden die voldoen aan de vereisten van artikel 5. Van de omstandigheden, vervat in dit sub-lid, mag worden afgeweken wanneer, naar de mening van een dierenarts, het dier niet zou lijden onder de gevolgen van een dergelijk afwijken;  

b. een dier niet in leven dient te worden gehouden of, voor zijn welzijn, niet kan profiteren van de bepalingen van artikel 5 zal het zo snel mogelijk volgens een humane methode gedood worden.     
4.  Geen dier dat is gebruikt in een procedure welke met hevige of langdurige pijn of met hevig of langdurig lijden gepaard ging, onverschillig of anaesthesie of analgesie werd toegepast, mag in een nieuwe procedure worden gebruikt tenzij zijn gezondheidstoestand en zijn welzijn weer normaal zijn geworden, en op voorwaarde dat: 

a. het dier gedurende de gehele nieuwe procedure onder algehele anaesthesie wordt gehouden, welke dient te worden gehandhaafd totdat het dier is gedood; of dat  

b. de nieuwe procedure slechts geringe ingrepen behelst.     

### Artikel  12  

Niettegenstaande de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, kan de verantwoordelijke autoriteit, waar noodzakelijk voor de legitieme doelstellingen van de procedure, toestaan dat het dier in kwestie wordt vrijgelaten, op voorwaarde dat hij zich ervan verzekerd heeft dat de grootst mogelijke zorg is aangewend ter bescherming van het welzijn van het dier. Procedures die de vrijlating van het dier met zich brengen zijn niet toegestaan voor het enkele doel van onderwijs en opleiding.  

### DEEL  IV  

####Vergunning

### Artikel  13  

Een procedure binnen de doelstellingen genoemd in artikel 2 mag slechts worden verricht door personen aan wie vergunning is verleend, ofwel onder de directe verantwoordelijkheid van een persoon aan wie vergunning is verleend, danwel indien voor het experimentele of wetenschappelijke project vergunning verleend is overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving. Deze vergunning wordt slechts toegekend aan personen die door de verantwoordelijke autoriteit deskundig worden geacht.

### *Inleiding* 

1. De lidstaten van de Raad van Europa hebben besloten dat zij zich ten doel stellen, levende dieren die voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden worden gebruikt, te beschermen, ten einde te waarborgen dat pijn, of onnodig lijden, dan wel angst of blijvend letsel hun toegebracht als gevolg van procedures waaraan zij worden onderworpen, tot een strict minimum worden beperkt.  

2. Het is waar dat sommige procedures worden verricht in het veld op in vrijheid levende, in hun eigen bestaan voorziende, wilde dieren, maar deze procedures zijn zeer beperkt in aantal. Het merendeel van de dieren die voor de procedures worden gebruikt, moet, om praktische redenen, onder de één of andere vorm van fysiek toezicht worden gehouden in onderkomens, variërend van omheinde buiten-terreinen tot hokken voor kleine dieren in het dierenverblijf van een laboratorium. Dit is een situatie waarin sprake is van vele tegenstrijdige belangen. Enerzijds het dier, wiens behoeften aan bewegingsvrijheid, sociale contacten en andere levensuitingen moeten worden beperkt, anderzijds degene die de procedures verricht en diens assistenten, die volledige controle over het dier en zijn omgeving eisen. In deze belangentegenstelling kan het belang van het dier soms op de tweede plaats komen.  

3. Daarom bepaalt de Europese Overeenkomst voor de bescherming van gewervelde dieren die worden gebruikt voor experimentele en andere wetenschappelijke doeleinden in artikel 5: „Elk dier, gebruikt of bestemd voor gebruik in een procedure, krijgt een onderkomen, een omgeving, ten minste een zekere bewegingsvrijheid, voedsel, water en verzorging passend bij zijn gezondheid en zijn welzijn. Iedere beperking van de mate waarin het dier aan zijn fysiologische en ethologische behoeften kan voldoen, dient zo gering mogelijk te zijn.”  

4. Deze bijlage bevat een aantal richtlijnen gebaseerd op de huidige kennis en praktijk inzake de huisvesting en verzorging van dieren. Zij legt uit en vult aan de in artikel 5 aanvaarde grondbeginselen. Het op deze wijze nagestreefde doel is derhalve de autoriteiten, instellingen en individuen te helpen in hun streven naar verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van de Raad van Europa op dit gebied.  

5. Het woord „verzorging”, gebruikt in relatie tot dieren die zijn bestemd voor of feitelijk worden gebruikt in procedures, omvat alle aspecten van de betrekkingen tussen het dier en de mens. Het begrip omvat het totaal van materiële en niet-materiële middelen die door de mens worden aangewend om een dier in een zodanige fysieke en mentale toestand te brengen en te houden, waar het zo min mogelijk lijdt en zo goed mogelijk functioneert in de procedures. De verzorging duurt vanaf het moment waarop het dier wordt uitgekozen om gebruikt te worden bij procedures tot het moment waarop het dier op humane wijze wordt gedood of op een andere wijze uit de weg wordt geruimd door de instelling aan het einde van de procedure overeenkomstig artikel 11 van de Overeenkomst.  

6. De bijlage beoogt advies te geven over de bouw van passende dierenverblijven. Er zijn evenwel verschillende methoden voor het fokken en houden van laboratoriumdieren, die zich voornamelijk van elkaar onderscheiden door de mate waarin het microbiologisch milieu wordt beheerst. Voorts dient men te bedenken dat het betrokken personeel soms op grond van het karakter en de conditie van de dieren zelf zal moeten beoordelen of de aanbevolen normen inzake de ruimte onvoldoende zijn, zoals bij bijzonder agressieve dieren. Bij de toepassing van de in deze bijlage gegeven richtlijnen dient rekening te worden gehouden met de eisen van die verschillende situaties. Bovendien is het nodig de status van deze richtlijnen duidelijk te maken. In tegenstelling tot de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst zelf zijn ze niet bindend: het zijn aanbevelingen die naar eigen inzicht moeten worden gehanteerd, bedoeld als handleiding in de praktijk en als maatstaf die alle betrokkenen gewetensvol zouden dienen na te streven. Daarom is de term „zouden” gebruikt in de gehele tekst, zelfs daar waar „dienen” passender zou lijken. Het is bijvoorbeeld vanzelfsprekend dat voedsel en water dienen te worden verstrekt (zie 3.7.2 en 3.8).  

7. Ten slotte, om praktische en financiële redenen behoeven bestaande dierenverblijven niet te worden vervangen zolang ze in goede staat verkeren of zolang ze niet anderszins onbruikbaar zijn geworden. In afwachting van vervanging door onderkomens die voldoen aan deze richtlijnen, zou zo veel mogelijk aan de richtlijnen dienen te worden voldaan door het aantal en de grootte van de dieren af te stemmen op de bestaande kooien en hokken.   
### *Definities* 

In deze bijlage A wordt, naast de definities vervat in artikel 1.2 van de Overeenkomst, verstaan onder: 

a. *„verblijfsruimten”:* vertrekken waar de dieren normaal zijn ondergebracht, hetzij voor de fokkerij of om in voorraad te houden, hetzij tijdens de uitvoering van een procedure;  

b. *„kooi”:* door gesloten wanden omsloten vaste of verplaatsbare houder, waarvan ten minste één wand bestaat uit metalen tralies of gaas of, indien nodig, netwerk en waarin één of meer dieren worden gehouden of vervoerd; afhankelijk van de bezettingsgraad en de afmetingen van de kooi, is de bewegingsvrijheid van de dieren betrekkelijk beperkt;  

c. *„box/hok”:* een oppervlak omsloten door bijvoorbeeld wanden, tralies of gaas, waar één of meer dieren worden gehouden; afhankelijk van de grootte van het terrein en de bezettingsgraad is de bewegingsvrijheid van de dieren gewoonlijk minder beperkt dan in een kooi;  

d. *„ren”:* een oppervlak omsloten door bijvoorbeeld hekken, wanden, tralies of gaas en veelal gelegen buiten permanente gebouwen, waar dieren die in kooien of boxen worden gehouden zich een bepaalde tijd overeenkomstig hun ethologische en fysiologische behoeften, zoals lichaamsbeweging, vrij kunnen bewegen;  

e. *„stal”:* een kleine ruimte met drie wanden, gewoonlijk voorzien van een ruif en van laterale tussenschotten, waar één of twee dieren vastgebonden kunnen worden gehouden.   
### *1. De gebouwen* 

1.1.  *Functies en algemeen ontwerp*  

1.1.1. Ieder gebouw zou zo ontworpen dienen te zijn dat dit een passende omgeving biedt aan de erin ondergebrachte diersoorten. Zij zou tevens zo ontworpen dienen te zijn dat onbevoegden de toegang wordt belet. Gebouwen die een onderdeel vormen van een groter gebouwencomplex zouden ook dienen te worden beveiligd door behoorlijke bouwvoorschriften en regelingen die het aantal ingangen beperken en het verkeer van onbevoegden beletten.  

1.1.2. Het verdient aanbeveling een onderhoudsprogramma voor de gebouwen op te stellen, teneinde storingen in het toebehoren te voorkomen.    

1.2.  *Verblijfsruimten*  

1.2.1. Alle nodige maatregelen zouden genomen moeten worden om een geregeld en doelmatig schoonmaken van de verblijven en de handhaving van behoorlijke hygiënische normen te waarborgen. Plafonds en muren zouden bestand dienen te zijn tegen beschadiging en een glad, ondoordringbaar en gemakkelijk afwasbaar oppervlak dienen te hebben. Bijzondere aandacht moet worden besteed aan de aansluiting van deuren, buizen, pijpen en kabels. De deuren en eventuele ramen zouden geconstrueerd of afgeschermd dienen te zijn op een manier die ongewenste dieren de toegang belet. Waar nodig kan in de deur een inspectieraam worden aangebracht. De vloeren zouden glad en ondoordringbaar dienen te zijn en een stroef, gemakkelijk afwasbaar oppervlak dienen te hebben, dat het gewicht van rekken en andere zware toestellen kan dragen zonder te worden beschadigd. Eventuele afvoeren zouden behoorlijk afgedekt dienen te zijn en voorzien zijn van een rooster om te voorkomen dat dieren kunnen binnenkomen.  

1.2.2. Verblijven waarin de dieren vrij kunnen rondlopen, zouden muren en vloeren met bijzonder slijtvaste bedekking dienen te hebben om bestand te zijn tegen de sterke slijtage veroorzaakt door de dieren en door het schoonmaken. Die bedekking zou niet schadelijk mogen zijn voor de gezondheid van de dieren en zou zodanig ontworpen dienen te zijn dat de dieren zich niet kunnen verwonden. In zulke verblijven zijn afvoeren gewenst. Toestellen of installaties zouden extra dienen te worden afgeschermd zodat zij niet kunnen worden beschadigd door de dieren of de dieren zelf kunnen verwonden. Daar waar rennen bestaan, zouden maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen om, in voorkomende gevallen, de toegang van publiek en dieren te beletten.  

1.2.3. Verblijven bestemd voor het huisvesten van landbouwhuisdieren (runderen, schapen, geiten, varkens, paarden, pluimvee, enz.) zouden tenminste dienen te voldoen aan de normen neergelegd in de Europese Overeenkomst inzake de bescherming van landbouwhuisdieren en vastgesteld door nationale veterinaire en andere instanties.  

1.2.4. De meerderheid der dierverblijven is gewoonlijk ontworpen voor het huisvesten van knaagdieren. Zeer vaak kunnen zulke ruimten ook worden gebruikt om grotere soorten te huisvesten. Er dient op te worden gelet dat niet bij elkaar passende soorten niet te zamen worden gehuisvest.  

1.2.5. De verblijven waar dieren zijn gehuisvest zouden, in voorkomende gevallen, uitgerust dienen te zijn met voorzieningen voor het uitvoeren van eenvoudige procedures en ingrepen.    

1.3.  *Laboratoria en algemene en bijzondere werkruimten*  

1.3.1. In fokinstellingen of toeleverende instellingen zouden passende voorzieningen beschikbaar dienen te zijn voor het voor verzending gereed maken van zendingen van dieren, die daarvoor in aanmerking komen.  

1.3.2. Alle instellingen zouden ook tenminste dienen te beschikken over laboratoriuminstallaties voor het vaststellen van eenvoudige diagnostische bepalingen, het verrichten van post-mortem onderzoek en/of het verzamelen van monsters voor uitvoeriger laboratoriumonderzoeken die elders zullen worden verricht.  

1.3.3. Bij het in ontvangst nemen van dieren zouden maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen waardoor de binnenkomende dieren geen gevaar opleveren voor reeds aanwezige dieren in het gebouw, bijvoorbeeld door plaatsing in quarantaine. Er zouden algemene en bijzondere werkruimten beschikbaar dienen te zijn voor gevallen waarin het niet wenselijk is de procedures of waarnemingen te verrichten in het dierverblijf uit te voeren.  

1.3.4. Er zouden passende ruimten dienen te zijn om zieke of gewonde dieren afgezonderd te huisvesten.  

1.3.5. In voorkomende gevallen zou het wenselijk zijn over één of meer afzonderlijke operatiekamers te beschikken, die behoorlijk zijn uitgerust voor het verrichten van chirurgische ingrepen onder aseptische omstandigheden. Waar zulks nodig is, zouden ruimten dienen te zijn voor post-operatief herstel.    

1.4.  *Dienstruimten*  

1.4.1. Opslagruimten voor voeders zouden koel en droog dienen te zijn en vrij gehouden dienen te worden van ongedierte en insekten; en de ruimten voor beddingmateriaal zouden droog dienen te zijn en vrij gehouden dienen te worden van ongedierte en insekten. Andere materialen, die besmet kunnen zijn of gevaar kunnen opleveren, zouden afzonderlijk dienen te worden bewaard.  

1.4.2. Er zouden ruimten beschikbaar dienen te zijn voor het opslaan van schone kooien, instrumenten en andere apparatuur.  

1.4.3. De schoonmaak- en wasruimten zouden groot genoeg dienen te zijn om de installaties te bevatten die nodig zijn om gebruikte apparatuur te ontsmetten en te reinigen. Het reinigingsproces zou georganiseerd dienen te zijn op een manier, dat het vuile materiaal van het schone gescheiden blijft, ten einde besmetting van zojuist gereinigd materiaal te voorkomen. De muren en vloeren zouden afgewerkt dienen te zijn met een geschikte slijtlaag en het ventilatiesysteem zou voldoende capaciteit dienen te hebben om overtollige warmte en vocht af te voeren.  

1.4.4. Voorzieningen zouden dienen te worden getroffen voor het onder hygiënische omstandigheden bewaren en afvoeren van kadavers en dierlijk afval. Indien ter plaatse verbranden niet mogelijk of wenselijk is, zouden passende voorzieningen dienen te worden getroffen om te verzekeren dat deze afvallen worden afgevoerd in overeenstemming met plaatselijke voorschriften en bepalingen. Speciale voorzorgsmaatregelen zouden dienen te worden getroffen voor sterk giftige (toxische) of radioactieve afvallen.  

1.4.5. Het ontwerp en de constructie van gangruimten zouden overeen dienen te komen met de normen voor de verblijfsruimten. De gangen zouden voldoende breed dienen te zijn om gemakkelijk transport van verrijdbare apparatuur toe te laten.     
### *2. Leefmilieu in de verblijfsruimten en de beheersing hiervan* 

2.1.  *Ventilatie*  

2.1.1. De verblijfsruimten zouden voorzien dienen te zijn van een ventilatiesysteem toereikend voor de behoeften van de soorten die er zijn gehuisvest. Het doel van het ventilatiesysteem is de aanvoer van verse lucht en de beperking van stank, schadelijke gassen, stof en besmettelijke micro-organismen. Een ander doel is de afvoer van overtollige warmte en vocht.  

2.1.2. De lucht in de ruimten zou veelvuldig dienen te worden ververst. Een ventilatietempo van 15-20 verversingen van de lucht per uur is in het algemeen voldoende. Desalniettemin kan, onder bepaalde omstandigheden, wanneer de bevolkingsdichtheid laag is, een ventilatietempo van 8-10 verversingen van de lucht per uur voldoende zijn en kan mechanische ventilatie zelfs helemaal overbodig blijken te zijn. In andere gevallen kan het nodig zijn veel vaker de lucht te verversen. Het opnieuw laten circuleren van onbehandelde lucht zou dienen te worden vermeden. Er dient evenwel met nadruk op te worden gewezen dat zelfs het meest efficiënte ventilatiesysteem slechte schoonmaakgewoonten of onachtzaamheid niet kan compenseren.  

2.1.3. Het ventilatiesysteem zou zodanig dienen te zijn ontworpen dat schadelijke tocht wordt voorkomen.  

2.1.4. Het zou verboden dienen te worden te roken in de ruimten waarin de dieren zich bevinden.    

2.2.  *Temperatuur*  

2.2.1. Tabel 1 geeft de aanbevolen boven- en benedengrens van de temperatuur aan. Er zou met nadruk op gewezen dienen te worden dat de getallen uitsluitend gelden voor volwassen, normale dieren. Pasgeboren en jonge dieren hebben vaak behoefte aan een veel hogere temperatuur. De kamertemperatuur zou geregeld dienen te worden met inachtneming van de mogelijke veranderingen in de warmteregulering van de dieren veroorzaakt door bijzondere fysiologische omstandigheden of door de gevolgen van de procedures.  

2.2.2. Onder de in Europa heersende klimaatomstandigheden kan het nodig zijn een ventilatiesysteem aan te brengen waarmee de aangevoerde lucht zowel kan worden verwarmd als kan worden gekoeld.  

2.2.3. In gebruikende instellingen zou de temperatuur van de verblijfsruimten nauwkeurig onder controle dienen te worden gehouden, omdat de omgevingstemperatuur een fysische factor is, die een grote invloed heeft op de stofwisseling van de dieren.    

2.3.  *Vochtigheid*  Extreme schommelingen in de relatieve vochtigheid (RV) hebben een nadelige uitwerking op de gezondheid en het welzijn van dieren. Daarom wordt aanbevolen het RV-niveau in de ruimten aan te passen aan de soorten die erin zijn gehuisvest en het RV-niveau gewoonlijk op 55% ± 10% te houden. Waarden beneden 40% of boven 70% zouden dienen te worden vermeden voor een langere periode.  

2.4.  *Verlichting*  In ruimten zonder ramen is het nodig te voorzien in regelbare verlichting om zowel te voldoen aan de biologische behoeften van de dieren, als een bevredigende werkomgeving te scheppen. Eveneens dient de lichtintensiteit regelbaar te zijn en de cyclus van licht en donker. Indien men albinodieren fokt zou rekening gehouden moeten worden met hun gevoeligheid voor licht (zie ook 2.6).  

2.5.  *Geluid*  Geluid kan in de dierverblijven een belangrijke storende factor zijn. De verblijfsruimten en de werkruimten waar procedures worden uitgevoerd zouden dienen te worden geïsoleerd tegen de bronnen van harde geluiden in het bereik van hoorbare klanken en hoogfrequente klanken, om stoornissen in het gedrag en de lichamelijke functies van de dieren te vermijden. Plotselinge geluiden kunnen leiden tot aanzienlijke verandering in het functioneren van de organen, maar aangezien bepaalde geluiden vaak onvermijdelijk zijn, kan het in bepaalde omstandigheden raadzaam zijn in de verblijfs- en werkruimten voortdurend enig geluid te laten klinken, zoals bijvoorbeeld zachte muziek.  

2.6.  *Alarmsysteem*  Een gebouw dat een groot aantal dieren herbergt is kwetsbaar. Daarom verdient het aanbeveling de gebouwen naar behoren te beveiligen door het aanbrengen van signaleringssystemen voor brand en voor het binnendringen van onbevoegden. Ook technische mankementen of storingen in het ventilatiesysteem vormen een gevaar, waardoor de dieren benauwd kunnen worden of zelfs kunnen omkomen, door verstikking of oververhitting in minder ernstige gevallen kan er een negatieve uitwerking zijn op het verloop van een procedure zodat deze mislukt en opnieuw moet worden uitgevoerd. Het zou derhalve dienstig zijn dat er aan het verwarmings- en ventilatiesysteem goede bewakingsvoorzieningen worden aangesloten om het personeel toezicht te laten houden op het algemeen functioneren hiervan. Indien hiertoe aanleiding bestaat, zou het wenselijk zijn een noodgenerator te installeren om het functioneren te verzekeren van de apparaten die het overleven van de dieren en de verlichting verzekeren ingeval de stroomtoevoer uitvalt of hapert. Duidelijke instructies inzake de te nemen maatregelen in een noodgeval zouden goed zichtbaar dienen te worden opgehangen. Aanbevolen wordt de visbakken van een alarmsysteem te voorzien, voor het geval de watertoevoer uitvalt. Het zou dienstig zijn te verzekeren dat het functioneren van het alarmsysteem de dieren zo min mogelijk verstoort.   
### *3. Verzorging* 

3.1.  *Gezondheid*  

3.1.1. De persoon aan het hoofd van de instelling zou ervoor dienen te zorgen dat een dierenarts of een andere deskundige de dieren regelmatig controleert en toezicht houdt op de huisvesting en verzorging der dieren.  

3.1.2. In verband met mogelijke risico's voor de dieren, zou bijzondere aandacht dienen te worden geschonken aan de gezondheid en de hygiëne van het personeel.    

3.2.  *Gevangenneming*  Wilde of van verwilderde dieren afstammende dieren zouden alleen middels humane methoden dienen te worden gevangen en door ervaren personen die beschikken over een gedegen kennis van de gewoonten en de leefomstandigheden van de te vangen dieren. Als er bij het vangen gebruik moet worden gemaakt van een verdovingsmiddel of welk geneesmiddel ook, zou het dienen te worden toegediend door een dierenarts of een ander deskundig persoon. Een ernstig gewond dier zou zo spoedig mogelijk voor behandeling naar een dierenarts dienen te worden gebracht. Indien, naar het oordeel van de dierenarts, het dier wel in leven kan blijven, maar daarbij blijvend lijden of pijn zal ondervinden, zou het onverwijld dienen te worden gedood volgens een humane methode. Indien geen dierenarts aanwezig is, zou een zwaar gewond dier onverwijld volgens een humane methode dienen te worden gedood.  

3.3.  *Omstandigheden van verpakking en vervoer*  Elk vervoer is voor dieren zonder enige twijfel een aangrijpende ervaring, die zo veel mogelijk zou dienen te worden verlicht. Dieren zouden in goede gezondheid dienen te verkeren om vervoerd te mogen worden en de verzender heeft de plicht zich ervan te vergewissen dat ze dat zijn. Zieke of in slechte conditie verkerende dieren zouden nimmer vervoerd mogen worden, tenzij voor behandeling of diagnose. Speciale zorg zou dienen te worden besteed aan hoogdrachtige dieren. Dieren waarvan verwacht kan worden dat zij tijdens het vervoer zullen werpen of dit in de voorafgaande achtenveertig uur hebben gedaan, alsmede hun jongen, zouden niet vervoerd dienen te worden. De verzender en de transporteur zouden bij het verpakken, het laden en het vervoer alle noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen dienen te treffen om onnodig lijden door onvoldoende ventilatie, door blootstelling aan extreme temperaturen, door gebrek aan voedsel en water, door langdurige vertragingen, enz. te voorkomen. De ontvanger zou naar behoren in kennis gesteld dienen te worden van de bijzonderheden van het vervoer en van de vervoersformaliteiten ten einde een snelle afhandeling en aflevering op de plaats van bestemming te waarborgen. Zelfs in het geval van Staten die niet partij zijn bij de Europese Overeenkomst inzake de bescherming van dieren tijdens internationaal vervoer, wordt aanbevolen de bepalingen daarvan strikt in acht te nemen. Tevens wordt aanbevolen de nationale wetten en voorschriften strikt te eerbiedigen, alsmede de voorschriften inzake levende dieren van de Internationale luchtvervoersvereniging en de Vereniging voor dierenvervoer door de lucht.  

3.4.  *Ontvangst en uitpakken*  De dozen en kratten waarin de dieren zijn vervoerd zouden zonder onnodige vertraging in ontvangst genomen en uitgepakt dienen te worden. Na inspectie zouden de dieren dienen te worden overgebracht naar een schone kooi of een schoon hok waar men ze op een passende wijze van voer en water voorziet. Dieren die ziek zijn of in slechte conditie verkeren zouden in observatie genomen dienen te worden en afgezonderd van andere dieren gehouden dienen te worden. Zij zouden zo spoedig mogelijk onderzocht dienen te worden door een dierenarts of een andere deskundige en zo nodig behandeld dienen te worden. Dieren die geen kans hebben op herstel zouden onverwijld middels een humane methode gedood dienen te worden. Tenslotte dienen alle ontvangen dieren geregistreerd en gemerkt te worden overeenkomstig de artikelen 16, 17 en 24 van de Overeenkomst. De dozen en kratten die gediend hebben voor het transport zouden onmiddellijk vernietigd dienen te worden indien men niet over ontsmettingsinstallaties beschikt.  

3.5.  *Quarantaine, isolatie en aanpassing*  

3.5.1. Het doel van quarantaine is: 

a. andere dieren in de instelling te beschermen;  

b. mensen te beschermen tegen besmetting door dieren;  

c. een goede wetenschapsbeoefening te bevorderen.   Tenzij de gezondheidstoestand van in een instelling binnengebrachte dieren bevredigend is, wordt aanbevolen hen in quarantaine te plaatsen. In sommige gevallen, bij voorbeeld in geval van hondsdolheid, kan de duur daarvan in de nationale wetgeving van de Partij zijn vastgelegd. In andere gevallen zal de duur variëren en zou deze vastgesteld dienen te worden door een deskundige afhankelijk van de omstandigheden; gewoonlijk de door de instelling aangestelde dierenarts (zie tevens Tabel 2). Dieren kunnen tijdens de quarantaineperiode worden gebruikt voor procedures in de mate waarin zij zijn gewend aan hun nieuwe omgeving en zij geen enkel noemenswaardig gevaar opleveren voor andere dieren of voor de mens.  

3.5.2. Aanbevolen wordt ruimten te bestemmen voor het isoleren van dieren die tekenen van slechte gezondheid vertonen of waarvan wordt vermoed dat ze in slechte gezondheid verkeren en die gevaar zouden kunnen opleveren voor de mens of voor andere dieren.  

3.5.3. Zelfs wanneer wordt vastgesteld dat de dieren in goede gezondheid verkeren, is het op grond van een verantwoord gebruik van proefdieren verstandig hen enige tijd te laten gewennen aan hun nieuwe omgeving voordat zij worden gebruikt in procedures. De benodigde tijd hangt af van verschillende factoren, zoals stress welke door het dier is ondergaan; deze is op zijn beurt afhankelijk van verschillende factoren, zoals de duur van het transport en de leeftijd van het dier. De duur van de aanpassingsperiode dient te worden vastgesteld door een deskundige.    

3.6.  *Plaatsing in kooi*  

3.6.1. Men kan in grote lijnen twee systemen voor het huisvesten van dieren onderscheiden. In de eerste plaats is er het systeem dat wordt toegepast in fokinstellingen, toeleverende en gebruikende instellingen in de bio-medische sector en ontworpen voor de huisvesting van dieren als knaagdieren, konijnen, vleeseters, vogels en niet-menselijke primaten, soms voor herkauwers, varkens en paarden. De voorgestelde richtlijnen voor kooien, hokken, rennen en stallen die geschikt zijn voor zulke instellingen zijn weergegeven in de tabellen 3 tot 13. De aanvullende aanwijzingen omtrent het minimum vloeroppervlak van kooien zijn weergegeven in de figuren 1 tot 7. Bovendien zijn overeenkomstige aanwijzingen voor de beoordeling van het aantal dieren per kooi weergegeven in de figuren 8 tot 12. In de tweede plaats is er het systeem, dat vaak bestaat in instellingen die procedures uitvoeren met uitsluitend landbouwhuisdieren of met dieren van een vergelijkbare grootte. De voorzieningen in dit soort instellingen zouden niet minder dienen te zijn dan krachtens de geldende veterinaire normen wordt vereist.  

3.6.2. Kooien en hokken zouden niet vervaardigd dienen te zijn van materiaal dat schadelijk is voor de gezondheid van de dieren; zij zouden zodanig ontworpen dienen te zijn dat de dieren zich niet kunnen verwonden en zij zouden dienen te zijn vervaardigd van stevig materiaal bestand tegen schoonmaak- en ontsmettingsmiddelen, tenzij ze na gebruik worden vernietigd. Bijzondere aandacht zou geschonken dienen te worden aan het ontwerp van de vloeren van de kooien en de hokken die zouden dienen te variëren al naar gelang het soort en de leeftijd van het dier en ontworpen dienen te zijn om het verwijderen van de uitwerpselen te vergemakkelijken.  

3.6.3. De hokken zouden ontworpen dienen te zijn voor het welzijn van de soorten. Zij zouden de bevrediging van bepaalde ethologische behoeften (bijvoorbeeld de behoefte te klimmen, zich tijdelijk af te zonderen of beschutting te zoeken) dienen toe te laten. Zij zouden gemakkelijk schoon te houden dienen te zijn en de dieren dienen te vrijwaren van contact met andere dieren.    

3.7.  *Voeding*  

3.7.1. Bij de keuze, de produktie en de bereiding van voer zouden voorzorgsmaatregelen genomen dienen te worden ter voorkoming van chemische, fysische of microbiologische besmetting. Het voer zou verpakt dienen te worden in gesloten waterdichte zakken waarop in voorkomende gevallen de produktiedatum staat aangegeven. De verpakking, het vervoer en de opslag zouden zodanig dienen te zijn dat besmetting, bederf of vernietiging wordt vermeden. De ruimten dienend voor opslag zouden koel, donker en droog en ontoegankelijk voor ongedierte en insekten dienen te zijn. Bederfelijke voedingsmiddelen, zoals groenvoer, groenten, fruit, vlees, vis, enz. zouden opgeslagen dienen te worden in koele ruimten, koelkasten en vriezers. Alle voerbakken, ruiven, troggen en ander gerei gebruikt voor het voederen van de dieren zouden regelmatig schoongemaakt dienen te worden en, zo nodig, gesteriliseerd dienen te worden. Als men nat voer gebruikt of voer dat gemakkelijk nat kan worden door water, urine enz., is dagelijkse reiniging noodzakelijk.  

3.7.2. Het aanbieden van de voedingsmiddelen varieert naar gelang de soort, maar dit zou zodanig dienen te geschieden dat aan de fysiologische behoeften van het dier wordt voldaan. Daarenboven zou het dienstig zijn de nodige maatregelen te nemen opdat elk dier het voer gemakkelijk kan bereiken.    

3.8.  *Water*  

3.8.1. Alle dieren dienen steeds onbesmet drinkwater tot hun beschikking te hebben. Gedurende het vervoer is het aanvaardbaar water te geven als onderdeel van een vochtige voeding. Water is evenwel een overbrenger van micro-organismen en zou daarom op zodanige wijze verstrekt dienen te worden dat het zo min mogelijk gevaar oplevert. Twee systemen worden algemeen toegepast, zuigflessen en automatische drenksystemen.  

3.8.2. Voor kleine dieren als knaagdieren en konijnen gebruikt men vaak zuigflessen. Wanneer dergelijke flessen gebruikt worden, zouden deze gemaakt dienen te zijn van doorzichtig materiaal, zodat men de inhoud kan controleren. De opening zou voldoende wijd dienen te zijn om gemakkelijk en doelmatig schoongemaakt te kunnen worden en als de zuigfles van plastic is, zou zij niet uitloogbaar dienen te zijn. Doppen, stoppen en slangen zouden gesteriliseerd dienen te kunnen worden en zouden gemakkelijk schoon te maken dienen te zijn. Alle zuigflessen en alle toebehoren zouden regelmatig dienen te worden gedemonteerd, schoongemaakt en gesteriliseerd. Het is beter telkens de zuigflessen te vervangen door schone, gesteriliseerde zuigflessen, dan deze in de dierverblijven opnieuw bij te vullen.  

3.8.3. Automatische drenksystemen zouden regelmatig nagekeken dienen te worden, onderhouden dienen te worden en men zou hun functioneren regelmatig dienen te controleren om ongevallen en de verspreiding van infecties te voorkomen. Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van kooien met een ondoorlaatbare vloer, zou men erop toe dienen te zien het risico van overstroming te verminderen. Tevens is het aan te bevelen het systeem regelmatig te onderwerpen aan een bacteriologische test om de kwaliteit van het water te controleren.  

3.8.4. Water afkomstig van het openbare leidingnet bevat enige micro-organismen, die doorgaans als ongevaarlijk worden beschouwd, behalve wanneer men werkt met microbiologische gedefinieerde dieren. In dergelijke gevallen zou het water behandeld dienen te worden. Aan water van het openbare leidingnet is doorgaans chloor toegevoegd om de groei van micro-organismen te beperken. Deze chloortoevoeging is niet altijd voldoende om de groei van sommige mogelijke ziekteverwekkers, zoals pseudomonas, te beperken. Een aanvullende voorzorgsmaatregel kan bestaan uit het verhogen van het chloorgehalte in het water of verzuring van het water om het gewenste effect te bereiken.  

3.8.5. Bij vissen, amfibieën en reptielen loopt de mate waarin zuren, chloor en vele andere chemicaliën worden verdragen per soort sterk uiteen. Daarom zouden voorzieningen getroffen dienen te worden om de toevoer van water aan aquaria en watertanks aan te passen aan de behoeften en de gevoeligheid van de individuele soorten.    

3.9.  *Bedding/strooisel*  De bedding zou droog, absorberend, stofvrij, niet giftig dienen te zijn en vrij van besmettelijke micro-organismen of ongedierte of enig andere vorm van besmetting. In het bijzonder zou het dienstig zijn het gebruik van zaagsel of beddingmateriaal vervaardigd uit hout dat een chemische behandeling heeft ondergaan te vermijden. Men kan gebruik maken van bepaalde industriële bijprodukten of afvalstoffen (zoals papiersnippers).  

3.10.  *Beweging en behandeling*  

3.10.1. Het zou dienstig zijn elke mogelijke gelegenheid te benutten om het dier lichaamsbeweging te laten nemen.  

3.10.2. Het gedrag van een dier tijdens een procedure is sterk afhankelijk van zijn vertrouwen in de mens, vertrouwen dat dient te worden ontwikkeld. Een wild dier of een dier voortgekomen uit een verwilderd dier zal vermoedelijk nooit een ideaal dier worden voor experimenten. Anders is dit met een huisdier, geboren en grootgebracht in contact met mensen. Wanneer het vertrouwen eenmaal is ontstaan, moet men het zien te behouden. Daarom wordt aanbevolen intensief met de dieren om te gaan, op een manier dat de dieren vertrouwd raken met de aanwezigheid en de activiteiten van mensen. Waar passend zou men de tijd dienen te nemen om tegen de dieren te praten, zich met hen bezig te houden en hen te verzorgen. Het personeel zou vriendelijk, zachtaardig en vastberaden dienen te zijn wanneer het zich bezighoudt met de dieren.    

3.11.  *Reiniging*  

3.11.1. De kwaliteit van een gebouw bestemd voor dieren is sterk afhankelijk van haar goede hygiëne. Er zouden duidelijke instructies gegeven dienen te worden voor het vervangen van het beddingmateriaal in de kooien en de hokken.  

3.11.2. Het zou dienstig zijn goede werkafspraken te maken voor het reinigen, wassen, ontsmetten en, indien nodig, steriliseren van de kooien en toebehoren, de zuigflessen en de rest van het materiaal. Het zou eveneens dienstig zijn een hoog niveau van reinheid en orde te handhaven in de dierverblijven, alsmede in de was- en opslagruimten.  

3.11.3. Het zou dienstig zijn het bodemmateriaal in kooien, hokken en rennen geregeld te reinigen en, waar nodig, te vervangen, om te voorkomen dat dit een bron van infectie wordt en vergeven raakt van parasieten.    

3.12.  *Het doden van dieren op humane wijze*  

3.12.1. Iedere humane methode om dieren te doden vereist vakkennis, die uitsluitend kan worden verworven door een passende opleiding.  

3.12.2. Een diep bewusteloos dier kan men laten verbloeden, maar middelen die de spieren verlammen voordat het dier het bewustzijn verliest, middelen met curariforme werking en elektrocutie zonder dat stroom door de hersenen wordt geleid, zouden niet toegepast dienen te worden zonder voorafgaande verdoving. De afvoer van een kadaver zou niet plaats dienen te vinden voor het intreden van de lijkstijfheid.

*Noot:* Onder „hoogte van de kooi” wordt verstaan de verticale afstand tussen de bodem van de kooi en het bovenste horizontale deel van het deksel of de kooi. Bij de planning van de procedures zou rekening gehouden dienen te worden met de mogelijke groei van de dieren om hen te verzekeren van voldoende ruimte overeenkomstig deze tabel gedurende alle fasen van de procedures. Zie tevens figuren 1 tot 5 en 8 tot 12.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

*Noot:* Voor de definitie van de „hoogte van de kooi”, zie de noot bij tabel 3. Bij het minimum vloeroppervlak van de kooi per voedster met jongen is het vloeroppervlak van het nest inbegrepen. Zie tevens figuur 6. 
###TABEL 6

### *Richtlijnen voor de huisvesting van katten (procedures en fokken)* 

|
|
| Gewicht van de kat  | Minimum vloeroppervlak per kat  | Minimum hoogte van de kooi  | Minimum vloeroppervlak van de kooi per poes met jongen  | Minimum vloeroppervlak van de kooi per poes met jongen  |
| kg  | m <sup>2</sup>  | cm  | m <sup>2</sup>  | m  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

*Noot:* De huisvesting in kooien van katten zou strict gelimiteerd dienen te zijn. Katten die op deze manier worden opgesloten, zouden ten minste één keer per dag uitgelaten dienen te worden om lichaamsbeweging te krijgen, voor zover dit de procedures niet verstoort. De hokken voor katten moet altijd met een kattebak uitgerust zijn, met een ligplaats en met voorwerpen waar zij in kunnen klimmen en waaraan zij hun nagels kunnen scherpen. Onder „hoogte van de kooi” wordt verstaan de verticale afstand tussen het hoogste punt op de bodem en het laagste punt in het dak van de kooi. Voor het berekenen van het minimum vloeroppervlak, kan het oppervlak van de ligplaatsen worden meegerekend. Het minimum vloeroppervlak per poes met jongen omvat het oppervlak van 0,18 m <sup>2</sup> van de nestruimte voor de jongen. Zie tevens figuur 7. 
###TABEL 7

### *Richtlijnen voor de huisvesting van honden in kooien (procedures)* 

|
|
| Schofthoogte van hond  | Minimum vloer oppervlak van de kooi per hond  | Minimum hoogte van de kooi  |
| cm  | m <sup>2</sup>  | cm  |
| --- | --- | --- |

*Noot:* Honden zouden niet langer in kooien ondergebracht dienen te worden dan strikt noodzakelijk is voor het doel van de procedure. Honden in een kooi zouden tenminste eenmaal per dag uitgelaten dienen te worden om lichaamsbeweging te krijgen, tenzij dit niet is te verenigen met het doel van de procedure. Er zou een maximumperiode vastgesteld dienen te worden waarboven een dier niet zou mogen worden opgesloten zonder dagelijkse lichaamsbeweging. De uitlaatruimten zouden groot genoeg dienen te zijn om de dieren toe te staan zich vrij te bewegen. Men zou roostervloeren niet dienen te gebruiken in kooien bestemd voor honden, tenzij de procedure zulk vereist. Gezien de grote verschillen in afmetingen en het beperkte verband tussen de afmeting en het gewicht van de verschillende honderassen, zou de hoogte van de kooi gebaseerd dienen te zijn op de schofthoogte van het betreffende dier. Als algemene regel zou de kooi minimaal tweemaal zo hoog dienen te zijn als de schofthoogte. Voor de definitie van de „hoogte van de kooi”, zie de noot bij tabel 6. 
###TABEL 8

### *Richtlijnen voor het huisvesten van honden in hokken (voorraad, procedures en fokken)* 

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Gewicht van de hond  | Minimum vloeroppervlak van  | Minimum aangrenzende uitloopruimte per hond  |
| kg  | m <sup>2</sup>  | tot 3 honden  | meer dan 3 honden  |
| m <sup>2</sup>  | m <sup>2</sup>  |
| --- | --- | --- |

*Noot:* De cijfers tussen haakjes geven het totale oppervlak per hond aan; dat wil zeggen het vloeroppervlak in het hok plus de aangrenzende uitloopruimte. Honden die permanent buiten worden gehouden zouden de beschikking dienen te hebben over een schuilplaats om zich te beschermen tegen slecht weer. Wanneer honden worden ondergebracht op een vloer met een rooster, zou hen een dicht oppervlak verstrekt dienen te worden om te slapen. Men zou slechts roosters mogen gebruiken indien de procedure zulks vereist. De afscheidingen tussen de hokken zouden zo gemaakt dienen te zijn, dat honden elkaar geen letsel kunnen toebrengen. Alle hokken zouden dienen te beschikken over een adequaat afvoersysteem. 
###TABEL 9

### *Richtlijnen voor het huisvesten in kooien van niet-menselijke primaten (voorraad, procedures en fokken)* 

*Inleidende noot:* Gezien de zeer grote verschillen in grootte en eigenschappen van primaten, is het in het bijzonder van belang de grootte, de inrichting en de maten van de kooien aan te passen aan hun specifieke behoeften. De totale inhoud van de kooi is even belangrijk voor primaten als het vloeroppervlak. Als algemene regel zou de hoogte van de kooi, althans voor mensapen en andere apen, de grootste afmeting dienen te hebben. De kooien zouden tenminste hoog genoeg dienen te zijn dat de dieren rechtop kunnen staan. De minimumhoogte van de kooi voor slingerapen zou die dieren toe dienen te laten te slingeren in hun volle lengte van het plafond zonder dat hun voeten de bodem van de kooi raken. In voorkomende gevallen zouden zitstokken aangebracht dienen te worden om de dieren in staat te stellen het bovenste deel van hun kooi te gebruiken. Het is mogelijk in één kooi twee primaten te huisvesten die met elkaar overweg kunnen. Wanneer de primaten niet per twee gehuisvest kunnen worden, zouden de kooien zo neergezet dienen te worden dat de dieren elkaar kunnen zien, maar in voorkomende gevallen zou ook dit dienen te kunnen worden verhinderd. Onder voorbehoud van bovenstaande opmerkingen, vormt de volgende tabel een algemene richtlijn voor het onderbrengen in kooien van de meest verbreid gebruikte soorten (superfamilies der breedneusapen (ceboïdea) en smalneusapen (cercophithecoïdea)).  

|
|
| Gewicht per primaat  | Minimum vloer oppervlak voor een of twee dieren  | Minimum hoogte van de kooi  |

|  *(Volwassen* *hanen)*   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  *Kwartels*   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

*Noot:* „Oppervlak” betekent het produkt van de lengte en de breedte van de kooi, inwendig en horizontaal gemeten, NIET het produkt van de lengte en de breedte van de vloer. Voor de definitie van de „hoogte van de kooi”, zie noot bij tabel 6. Bij roostervloeren zouden de mazen voor kuikens niet groter dienen te zijn dan 10 x 10 mm en voor jonge hennen en volwassen vogels 25 x 25 mm. De diameter van het ijzerdraad zou ten minste 2 mm dienen te zijn. De helling van de bodem zou 14% (8°) niet dienen te overschrijden. De drinkgoten zouden dezelfde lengte dienen te hebben als de voederbakken. Wanneer drinkbakken met speen of bakjes worden gebruikt, zou iedere vogel toegang dienen te hebben tot twee drinkbakken met speen of twee bakjes. De kooien zouden voorzien dienen te zijn van zitstokken en vogels in afzonderlijke kooien toelaten elkaar te zien.

### Bijlage  B  

####Statistische tabellen en Toelichtende noten over de manier van invullen hiervan overeenkomstig de voorschriften van de artikelen 27 en 28 van de Overeenkomst

### *Inleiding* 

Uit hoofde van de artikelen 27 en 28 van de Overeenkomst dient iedere partij statistische gegevens te verzamelen met betrekking tot bepaalde aspecten van de procedures waarop de Overeenkomst betrekking heeft en deze informatie door te geven aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, die ze publiceert. Iedere partij bepaalt zelf de methode voor het verzamelen van de gegevens en uiteraard verzet niets zich ertegen dat men aanvullende statistische gegevens verzamelt voor nationale behoeften. Ten einde de taak van de Secretaris-Generaal te vergemakkelijken, dienen de aan hem verstrekte gegevens evenwel onderling vergelijkbaar te zijn en overeen te stemmen met de bijgevoegde tabellen. De gegevens worden per kalenderjaar verzameld. 
### *Algemeen* 

De te tellen dieren zijn die die worden gebruikt voor procedures waardoor hun pijn, lijden, angst, of blijvend letsel kan worden berokkend (zie artikel 1.2.c van de Overeenkomst). Het tellen dient te geschieden wanneer de dieren voor een procedure worden gebruikt. Ieder dier mag slechts eenmaal in dezelfde tabel worden geteld. Dieren die niet aan procedures worden onderworpen van het type zoals gedefinieerd in artikel 1.2.c mogen niet worden meegeteld voor het verzamelen van statistische gegevens ingevolge deze Overeenkomst. Gezien de aard van het biologisch onderzoek is het onvermijdelijk dat er zich gelegenheden voordoen waarin het moeilijk is vast te stellen in welke kolom van een tabel een dier, dat in een procedure is gebruikt, vermeld dient te worden. Er bestaat geen goede of foute methode om dit probleem op te lossen: dat is een kwestie van persoonlijke keuze. Onder voorbehoud van richtlijnen, welke de bevoegde autoriteiten kunnen geven is het aan de onderzoeker vast te stellen onder welke rubriek hij zijn dier behoort te vermelden.  *Het is echter van essentieel belang ervoor te zorgen dat geen enkel dier tweemaal wordt geteld in dezelde tabel.*  
### *Tabel 1* 

### *Aantal en soorten dieren gebruikt bij procedures* 

In deze tabel dient het totale aantal bij procedures gebruikte dieren te worden vermeld, dit totaal wordt uitgesplitst naar categorieën of klassen dieren. 
### *Tabel 2* 

### *Aantal dieren gebruikt bij procedures voor geselecteerde doeleinden* 

Deze tabel is bedoeld om te laten zien hoeveel dieren worden gebruikt voor de volgende onderzoeksterreinen: fundamenteel onderzoek, ontwikkeling van nieuwe produkten, onderzoek naar de veiligheid van producten, diagnose van ziekten en onderwijs en training. In kolom 1 wordt onder „medisch” tevens verstaan: diergeneeskundig. 
### *Tabel 3* 

### *Aantal dieren gebruikt bij procedures voor geselecteerde doeleinden ten behoeve van de bescherming van mens, dier en milieu door middel van toxicologische tests of ander veiligheidsonderzoek* 

Deze tabel is bedoeld om een meer gedetailleerde uitsplitsing te geven van procedures uitgevoerd voor de algemene bescherming van mens, dier en milieu, met uitzondering van procedures voor medische doeleinden. In kolom 6 is ook schadelijke straling opgenomen. 
### *Tabel 4* 

### *Aantal dieren dat wordt gebruikt bij procedures verband houdende met ziekten en andere gezondheidsstoornissen* 

Deze tabel is bedoeld om aan te geven hoeveel dieren er worden gebruikt voor medische doeleinden, met inbegrip van diergeneeskundige, waarbij in het bijzonder drie groepen van ziekten bij de mens worden vermeld die in de algemene publieke belangstelling staan. 
### *Tabel 5* 

### *Aantal dieren gebruikt bij wettelijk vereiste procedures* 

De kolom „alleen de betrokken Partij” moet alleen worden ingevuld wanneer de proef wordt vereist krachtens de wet van de Partij waarin de proef plaats vindt, met inbegrip van internationale verplichtingen die die Partij heeft aangegaan (bijvoorbeeld als Partij bij het Verdrag inzake de samenstelling van een Europese farmacopee of als lidstaat van de Europese Gemeenschappen). De kolom „alleen andere Partijen” wordt ingevuld, indien de procedure speciaal bedoeld is om aan bepaalde voorschriften van andere landen dan de Partij te voldoen, met inbegrip van handelsvoorschriften, en voorschriften uit overeenkomsten waarbij zij geen partij is. De rubriek „beide” wordt gebruikt wanneer de procedure is bedoeld om te voldoen aan vereisten van beide groepen; in dat geval wordt geen van de beide andere kolommen ingevuld.
