Unless otherwise specified in this Convention, neither invalidity cash benefits, old-age or survivors' cash benefits, pensions in respect of occupational injuries or diseases, nor death grants, payable under the legislation of one or more Contracting Parties, shall be liable to reduction, modification, suspension, suppression or forfeiture by reason of the fact that the beneficiary is resident in the territory of a Contracting Party other than that in which the institution liable for payment is situated.

8.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides for contributions to be deducted from the pension payable for the purpose of entitlement to benefits in kind, the institution of the Party which pays the pension shall be authorised to make such deductions if the cost of the benefits in kind is borne by an institution of that Party by virtue of this Article.

####Common provisions

### Article  27  

Where a person has been subject successively or alternatively to the legislation of two or more Contracting Parties, the said person or his survivors shall be entitled to benefits in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, even if such persons would be entitled to claim benefits under the legislation of one or more Contracting Parties without these provisions being applied.  

### Article  28  

1.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party makes the acquisition, maintenance or recovery of entitlement to benefits conditional upon the completion of periods of insurance, the institution which applies that legislation shall, to that end, for the purpose of adding periods together, take account of periods of insurance completed under the legislation of any other Contracting Party and, where appropriate, of periods of residence completed after the age of sixteen under non-contributory schemes of any other Contracting Party, as if they were periods of insurance completed under the legislation of the first Party.   
2.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party makes the acquisition, maintenance or recovery of entitlement to benefits conditional upon the completion of periods of residence, the institution which applies that legislation shall, to that end, for the purpose of adding periods together, take account of periods of insurance completed under the legislation of any other Contracting Party, and, where appropriate, of periods of residence completed after the age of sixteen under non-contributory schemes of any other Contracting Party, as if they were periods of residence completed under the legislation of the first Party.   
3.  Where, under the legislation of a Contracting Party, a person has been affiliated at the same time to a contributory scheme and to a non-contributory scheme for the same contingency, the institution of any other Contracting Party concerned shall have regard, in applying paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article, to the longest period of insurance or of residence completed under the legislation of the first Party.   
4.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party makes the provision of certain benefits conditional upon the completion of periods of insurance in an occupation covered by a special scheme or in a specified occupation or employment, only periods completed under a corresponding scheme, or, failing that, in the same occupation or, where appropriate, in the same employment, under the legislation of other Contracting Parties, shall be taken into account for the award of such benefits. If, notwithstanding periods completed in this way, the person concerned does not satisfy the conditions for entitlement to the said benefits, the periods concerned shall be taken into account for the award of benefits under the general scheme or, failing that, the scheme applicable to wage-earners or to salaried employees, as appropriate.   
5.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party, which does not make entitlement to benefits or the amount thereof subject to any specific period of insurance or employment but makes the provision of such benefits conditional on the person concerned or, in the case of survivors' benefits, the deceased, having been subject to that legislation at the time at which the contingency arose, that condition shall be considered fulfilled if the person concerned or the deceased, as the case may be, was subject at that time to the legislation of another Contracting Party.   
6.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that the period of payment of a pension may be taken into consideration for the acquisition, maintenance or recovery of entitlement to benefits, the competent institution of that Party shall to that end take account of any period during which a pension was paid under the legislation of any other Contracting Party.   

### Article  29  

1.  The institution of each Contracting Party to whose legislation the person concerned has been subject shall determine, in accordance with the legislation which it applies, whether such person satisfies the conditions for entitlement to benefits having regard, where appropriate, to the provisions of Article 28.   
2.  If the person concerned satisfies those conditions, the said institution shall calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit he could claim if all the periods of insurance and of residence completed under the legislation of the Contracting Parties concerned, and taken into account for determining entitlement, in accordance with the provisions of Article 28, had been completed exclusively under the legislation which that institution applies.   
3.  However, 

(a) in the case of benefits the amount of which does not depend on the length of periods completed, that amount shall be taken to be the theoretical amount referred to in the preceding paragraph;  

(b) in the case of benefits specified in Annex IV, the theoretical amount referred to in the preceding paragraph may be calculated on the basis of the full benefit and up to an amount not exceeding it: 

(i) in the case of invalidity or death, in proportion to the ratio of the total periods of insurance and residence completed, before the contingency arose, by the person concerned or the deceased under the legislation of all Contracting Parties concerned and taken into account in accordance with the provisions of Article 28, to two-thirds the number of years which elapsed between the date on which the person concerned or the deceased reached the age of sixteen and the date on which occurred the incapacity for work followed by invalidity or the death, as the case may be, disregarding any years subsequent to pensionable age;  

(ii) in the case of old age, in proportion to the ratio of the total periods of insurance and residence completed by the person concerned under the legislation of all the Contracting Parties concerned, and taken into account in accordance with the provisions of Article 28, to thirty years, disregarding any years subsequent to pensionable age.       
4.  The said institution shall then calculate the actual amount of the benefit payable by it to the person concerned on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 or of paragraph 3 of this Article, as appropriate, and in proportion to the ratio of the periods of insurance or residence completed before the contingency arose under the legislation which it applies, to the total of the periods of insurance or residence completed before the contingency arose under the legislation of all the Contracting Parties concerned.   
5.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that the amount of benefits or certain parts thereof shall be in proportion to the periods of insurance or residence completed, the competent institution of that Party may calculate those benefits or parts thereof directly, solely on the basis of the periods completed under the legislation which it applies, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 4 of this Article.   

### Article  30  

1.  For the calculation of the theoretical amount referred to in Article 29, paragraph 2: 

(a) where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that benefits shall be calculated on the basis of average earnings, an average contribution, an average increase or on the basis of the ratio of the claimant's gross earnings during the periods of insurance to the average gross earnings of all insured persons other than apprentices, such average figures or ratios shall be determined by the competent institution of that Party solely on the basis of the periods completed under the legislation of the said Party or of the gross earnings received by the person concerned during those periods only;  

(b) where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that benefits shall be calculated on the basis of the amount of earnings, contributions or increases, the earnings, contributions or increases to be taken into account by the competent institution of that Party in respect of periods completed under the legislation of other Contracting Parties shall be determined on the basis of the average earnings, contributions or increases recorded for the periods completed under the legislation of the first Party;  

(c) where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that benefits shall be calculated on the basis of fixed earnings or a fixed amount, the earnings or the amount to be taken into account by the competent institution of that Party in respect of periods completed under the legislation of other Contracting Parties shall be equal to the fixed earnings or the fixed amount or, where appropriate, the average fixed earnings or fixed amount corresponding to the periods completed under the legislation of the first Party;  

(d) where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that benefits shall be calculated, in respect of certain periods, on the basis of earnings and, in respect of other periods, on the basis of fixed earnings or a fixed amount, the competent institution of that Party shall take into account, in respect of periods completed under the legislation of other Contracting Parties, the earnings or amounts determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph *(b)* or sub-paragraph *(c)* of this paragraph, as appropriate; where in respect of all the periods completed under the legislation of the first Party, the benefits are calculated on the basis of fixed earnings or a fixed amount, the earnings to be taken into account by the competent institution of that Party, in respect of periods completed under the legislation of other Contracting Parties, shall be equal to the notional earnings corresponding to the said fixed earnings or fixed amount.     
2.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party embodies rules providing for the revaluation of the factors taken into account for the calculation of benefits these rules shall apply, where appropriate, to the factors taken into account by the competent institution of that Party, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, in respect of periods completed under the legislation of other Contracting Parties.   
3.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides that the amount of benefits shall vary with the number of members of the family, the competent institution of that Party shall take account also of the members of the family resident in the territory of another Contracting Party, as if they were resident in the territory of the first Party.   

### Article  31  

1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 29, where the total duration of the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of a Contracting Party is less than one year and where, taking into account only those periods, no entitlement to benefits exists under that legislation, the institution of the Party concerned shall not be bound to award benefits in respect of the said periods.   
2.  The periods referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be taken into account by the institution of each of the other Contracting Parties concerned for the purpose of applying Article 29, except paragraph 4 thereof.   
3.  However, where the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article would have the effect of relieving all the institutions concerned of the obligation to award benefits, benefits shall be awarded exclusively under the legislation of the last Contracting Party whose conditions are fulfilled by the person concerned, regard being had to the provisions of Article 28, as if all the periods referred to in paragraph 1 of the present Article had been completed under the legislation of that Party.   

### Article  32  

1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 29, where the total of all periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of a Contracting Party is at least one year but less than five years, the institution of that Party shall not be bound to award oldage benefits in respect of the said periods.   
2.  The periods referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be taken into account, for the purpose of applying Article 29, by the institution of the Contracting Party under whose legislation the person concerned completed the longest period of insurance or residence, as if the periods in question had been completed under the legislation of that Party. Where, under this rule, the said periods would have to be taken into account by more than one institution, they shall be taken into account only by the institution of the Contracting Party to whose legislation the person concerned was last subject.   
3.  The institution referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall transfer to the institution mentioned in paragraph 2, in final settlement, a lump sum equal to ten times the annual amount of the partbenefit payable by the last-mentioned institution, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29, in respect of periods completed under the legislation applied by the first institution. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned may agree on different arrangements for settling their liabilities in respect of such periods.   
4.  However, where the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article would have the effect of relieving all the institutions concerned of the obligation to award benefits, benefits shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of Article 29.   
5.  Where the combined application of the provisions of Article 31, paragraph 1, and of paragraph 1 of this Article would have the effect of relieving all the institutions concerned of the obligation to award benefits, benefits shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of Article 29, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 31, paragraphs 1 and 2.   
6.  The application of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article as between two or more Contracting Parties shall be subject to the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements between those Parties and shall be limited to cases in which the persons concerned have been subject exclusively to the legislation of those Parties.   

### Article  33  

1.  If the person concerned does not, at a given date, satisfy the conditions required by the legislation of all the Contracting Parties concerned, regard being had to the provisions of Article 28, but satisfies the conditions of the legislation of only one or more of them, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) the amount of the benefits payable shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 4 or of paragraph 5 of Article 29, as appropriate, by each of the competent institutions applying legislation the conditions of which are fulfilled;  

(b) however, 

(i) if the person concerned satisfies the conditions of at least two legislations, without any need to include periods of insurance or residence completed under legislations the conditions of which are not fulfilled, such periods shall not be taken into account for the purpose of applying the provisions of Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 4;  

(ii) if the person concerned satisfies the conditions of one legislation only, without any need to invoke the provisions of Article 28, the amount of the benefit payable shall be calculated exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the legislation the conditions of which are fulfilled, taking account of periods completed under that legislation only.       
2.  Benefits awarded under one or more of the legislations concerned in the case covered by the preceding paragraph shall be recalculated *ex officio,* in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 4 or of paragraph 5 of Article 29, as appropriate, as and when the conditions prescribed by the other legislation or legislations concerned are satisfied, regard being had, where appropriate, to the provisions of Article 28.   
3.  Benefits awarded under the legislation of two or more Contracting Parties shall be recalculated, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, at the request of the beneficiary, when the conditions prescribed by one or more of the legislations concerned cease to be fulfilled.   

### Article  34  

1.  Where the amount of the benefits a person would be entitled to claim under the legislation of a Contracting Party, disregarding the provisions of Articles 28 to 33, is greater than the total benefits payable in accordance with those provisions, the competent institution of that Party shall pay a supplement equal to the difference between the two amounts, and shall bear the whole cost thereof.   
2.  Where the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraph would have the effect of entitling the person concerned to supplements from the institutions of two or more Contracting Parties, he shall receive only whichever is the largest, and the cost shall be apportioned among the competent institutions of the Contracting Parties concerned according to the ratio beween the amount of the supplement which each of them would have to pay if it alone had been concerned and the amount of the combined supplement which all the said institutions would have had to pay.   
3.  The supplement referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be regarded as a component of the benefits provided by the institution liable for payment. Its amount shall be determined once and for all, except where it may be necessary to apply the provisions of paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 of Article 33.

a) In order to determine whether the periods treated under German legislation as periods of interruption (Ausfallzeiten) or supplementary periods (Zurechnungszeiten) shall be taken into account as such periods, compulsory contributions paid by virtue of the legislation of another Contracting Party and compulsory insurance under the pensions insurance of another Contracting Party are deemed to be equivalent to compulsory contributions paid by virtue of German legislation and to compulsory insurance under German pensions insurance.

The remuneration of the worker concerned shall be determined or recalculated according to the provisions of German legislation.  

b) The total of the accident insurance pension and the theoretical amount within the meaning of Article 29, paragraph 2, of this Convention, but excluding supplementary benefits, childrens supplements and increments of complementary insurance (Höherversicherung), is compared with the maximum amount taken into consideration in application of the preceding sub-paragraph.

4. With regard to the suppression of compensatory benefits under the miners' scheme, mining undertakings in the territory of another Contracting Party are regarded as equivalent to German mining undertakings.

4. Periods are not to be taken into consideration in the case of a married woman by virtue of the preceding paragraph when they coincide with periods taken into consideration for the calculation of the old-age pension due to her under the legislation of another Contracting Party or with periods during which she received an old-age pension under such legislation.

####Application of the legislation of Switzerland

1. The principle of equality of treatment set forth in Article 8 of this Convention does not apply to: 

a) optional old-age survivors' insurance and optional invalidity insurance for Swiss nationals abroad;  

b) old-age survivors' insurance and invalidity insurance of Swiss nationals working abroad for an employer in Switzerland;  

c) relief benefits paid to Swiss invalids residing abroad;  

d) special pensions under old-age and survivors' insurance paid to Swiss nationals born before 1 July 1883 or to their survivors.    

2. Special invalidity insurance pensions old-age pensions payable in lieu thereof are awarded to nationals of the Contracting Parties subject to the conditions that they have resided in Switzerland throughout five years immediately preceding the lodging of the claim. A reservation is made on the provisions of Article 39, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Federal Act on invalidity insurance. Special old-age survivors' insurance pensions are awarded to nationals of the Contracting Parties subject to the condition that they have resided in Switzerland throughout ten years immediately preceding the lodging of the claim in the case of old-age pensions, or subject to the condition that the deceased has resided in Switzerland throughout five years immediately preceding the lodging of the claim in the case of survivors' pensions or old-age pensions payable in lieu thereof. The period of residence in question is deemed to be uninterrupted, when absence from Swiss territory does not exceed three months in the course of any calendar year. Periods of residence in Switzerland during which the person concerned has been exempt from Swiss invalidity, old-age and survivors' insurance are not taken into account for the required duration of residence.  

3. Where nationals of the Contracting Parties have acquired a right to benefits under Swiss invalidity, old-age and survivors' insurance, the provisions of Article 29, paragraph 5, of this Convention will be applied for the calculation of the amount of the pensions due under Swiss insurance.  

4. With regard to entitlement to ordinary invalidity pensions, nationals of the Contracting Parties are deemed to be insured within the meaning of Swiss legislation if, at the time of the commencement of invalidity, they are covered by pensions insurance of any Contracting Party or if they are entitled to invalidity benefits under the legislation of any Contracting Party.  

5. 

a) Nationals of the Contracting Parties may request rehabilitation under the federal legislation on invalidity insurance as long as they keep their domicile in Switzerland, provided they have paid contributions to Swiss insurance for at least a whole year immediately preceding the time when they shall benefit from such rehabilitation.  

b) Wives and widows who do not follow a gainful activity, as well as minors, children of nationals of the Contracting Parties, may request rehabilitation under the federal legislation on invalidity insurance as long as they keep their domicile in Switzerland, provided they have resided there without interruption for at least one year immediately preceding the time when they shall benefit by such rehabilitation. However, periods of temporary residence outside the Swiss territory not exceeding two months during a calendar year do not interrupt residence in Switzerland.  

c) Minors, children of nationals of the Contracting Parties, may request rehabilitation under the federal legislation on invalidity insurance if they have their domicile in Switzerland and have been invalids since birth there or if they have resided in Switzerland without interruption since their birth.      

####Europees Verdrag inzake sociale zekerheid

De Lid-Staten van de Raad van Europa welke dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Overwegende dat de Raad van Europa het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn leden beoogt, in bijzonder om hun sociale vooruitgang te bevorderen; Overwegende dat multilaterale coördinatie van de wettelijke regelingen inzake sociale zekerheid één van de middelen is om deze doelstelling te verwezenlijken; Overwegende dat artikel 73 van de op 16 april 1964 voor ondertekening opengestelde Europese Code inzake sociale zekerheid bepaalt dat de Contracterende Partijen bij de Code ernaar streven in een afzonderlijk document de vraagstukken te regelen die betrekking hebben op de sociale zekerheid van buitenlanders en migranten, in het bijzonder met betrekking tot de gelijkstelling met de eigen onderdanen en het behoud van verworven rechten en rechten die nog verworven worden; Bevestigende het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling van de onderdanen der Verdragsluitende Partijen, vluchtelingen en staatlozen ten aanzien van de sociale zekerheidswetgeving van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij, alsmede het beginsel van het behoud van de uit de sociale zekerheidswetgeving voortvloeiende voordelen, onverschillig of de beschermde personen zich binnen de grondgebieden van de Verdragsluitende Partijen verplaatsen, zijnde beginselen, waarvan trouwens niet alleen sommige bepalingen van het Europees Sociaal Handvest, maar ook verschillende verdragen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie zijn uitgegaan;   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij de terugbetaling van premies of bijdragen afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat de betrokkene niet meer verplicht verzekerd is, wordt deze voorwaarde geacht niet te zijn vervuld zolang hij verplicht verzekerd is ingevolge de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
6.  In bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten regelen de Verdragsluitende Partijen de betaalbaarstelling van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde uitkeringen, verschuldigd aan personen die aanspraken aan dit Verdrag kunnen ontlenen, wanneer zij wonen op het grondgebied van een Staat welke geen Verdragsluitende Partij is.   

### Artikel  12  

De in de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij opgenomen bepalingen inzake aanpassing van de uitkeringen aan het loon- of prijsniveau zijn eveneens van toepassing op de uitkeringen welke op grond van bedoelde wetgeving overeenkomstig dit Verdrag verschuldigd zijn.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  Met uitzondering van het recht op uitkeringen bij invaliditeit of ouderdom, uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen of die wegens beroepsziekte, welke door de organen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen overeenkomstig artikel 29 of artikel 47, sub b), worden vastgesteld, kan krachtens dit Verdrag geen recht worden verkregen of gehandhaafd op meer dan één uitkering van dezelfde aard of op meer dan één uitkering welke betrekking heeft op eenzelfde tijdvak van verplichte verzekering.   
2.  De bepalingen inzake vermindering, schorsing of intrekking waarin de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij voorziet ingeval van samenloop van een uitkering met andere uitkeringen of met andere inkomsten, of wegens het verrichten van beroepswerkzaamheden, zijn op de rechthebbende van toepassing, zelfs indien het gaat om uitkeringen welke op grond van de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn verkregen of om inkomsten, welke zijn verworven of werkzaamheden welke zijn verricht op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Voor de toepassing van deze regel wordt evenwel geen rekening gehouden met gelijksoortige uitkeringen bij invaliditeit of ouderdom, uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen of die wegens beroepsziekte, welke overeenkomstig artikel 29 of artikel 47, sub b) door de organen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen worden vastgesteld.

(ii) indien zij echter tewerkgesteld zijn door een filiaal of vaste vertegenwoordiging welke die onderneming heeft op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan zij haar zetel heeft, is op hen de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zich dit filiaal of deze vaste vertegenwoordiging bevindt, van toepassing;

b) op zelfstandigen die hun werkzaamheden op het grondgebied van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen plegen te verrichten, is van toepassing de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen, indien zij een deel van hun werkzaamheden op dit grondgebied verrichten, of indien zij alleen reeds op grond van het feit dat zij op het grondgebied van laatstbedoelde Partij wonen, aan deze wetgeving onderworpen zijn;  

c) ingeval de sub b) bedoelde zelfstandigen niet een deel van hun werkzaamheden verrichten op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij wonen of indien zij niet alleen reeds op grond van hun woonplaats aan de wetgeving van deze Partij onderworpen zijn, of indien bedoelde Partij geen wetgeving heeft welke op hen van toepassing is, is op hen van toepassing de wetgeving welke in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen of tussen hun bevoegde autoriteiten wordt vastgesteld.     
4.  Indien krachtens de voorgaande leden van dit artikel op een werknemer van toepassing is de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij geen beroepswerkzaamheden verricht, is deze wetgeving op hem van toepassing alsof hij op het grondgebied van deze Partij wel dergelijke werkzaamheden verrichtte.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  De artikelen 14 en 15 zijn niet van toepassing op de vrijwillige of de vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering.   
2.  Ingeval toepassing van de wetgevingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen zou kunnen leiden tot aansluiting bij een stelsel van verplichte verzekering en tot gelijktijdige toelating tot één of meer stelsels van vrijwillige of vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering, is op belanghebbende uitsluitend het stelsel van verplichte verzekering van toepassing. De bepalingen van de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij welke ter zake van invaliditeit, ouderdom en overlijden (pensioenen) gelijktijdige aansluiting bij de vrijwillige of vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering en de verplichte verzekering toestaan, blijven onverlet.   
3.  Ingeval toepassing van de wetgeving van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen zou kunnen leiden tot toelating van twee of meer stelsels van vrijwillige of vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering, kan de belanghebbende slechts worden toegelaten tot het stelsel van vrijwillige of vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, of, indien hij niet op het grondgebied van een van deze Partijen woont, tot het stelsel van die van deze Partijen voor de wetgeving waarvan bij heeft gekozen.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  Artikel 14, sub a) is van toepassing op leden van het bedienende personeel van diplomatieke zendingen of consulaire posten en op particuliere bedienden in dienst van ambtenaren van deze zendingen of posten.   
2.  Niettemin mogen de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde loontrekkenden die onderdaan zijn van de Verdragsluitende Partij welke zendstaat is, kiezen voor de toepassing van de wetgeving van deze Partij. Dit keuzerecht mag slechts eenmaal worden uitgeoefend en wel binnen drie maanden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag of op het tijdstip waarop de belanghebbende voor de diplomatieke zending of de consulaire post, onderscheidenlijk in persoonlijke dienst van ambtenaren van deze zending of post wordt aangesteld. De keuze wordt van kracht op het tijdstip waarop ze wordt gedaan.   

### Artikel  18  

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen in onderlinge overeenstemming, ten behoeve van de belanghebbenden, uitzonderingen op de artikelen 14 tot en met 17 vaststellen.   
2.  Voor zover nodig is toepassing van het voorgaande lid afhankelijk van een verzoek van de betrokken werknemers en eventueel van hun werkgevers. Bovendien neemt de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan de wetgeving van toepassing zou moeten zijn, een beslissing, waarin wordt vastgesteld dat op bedoelde werknemers niet langer deze wetgeving maar wel de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij van toepassing is.   

### TITEL  III  

####Bijzondere bepalingen met betrekking tot de verschillende soorten prestaties

### Hoofdstuk  1  

####Ziekte en moederschap

### Artikel  19  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op prestaties afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede, in voorkomend geval, met de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van verzekering betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij toelating tot de verplichte verzekering afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, worden, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede in voorkomend geval, de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld daartoe, voor zover nodig, mede in aanmerking genomen alsof deze tijdvakken van verzekering krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  Personen die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat wonen en aan de in de wettelijke regeling van laatstbedoelde Staat gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op prestaties voldoen, hebben eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 19, op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij wonen, recht op: 

a) verstrekkingen, welke voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan van de woonplaats worden verleend volgens de door laatstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze personen bij dit orgaan waren aangesloten;  

b) uitkeringen, welke door het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze personen op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat woonden. Na overeenstemming tussen het bevoegde orgaan en het orgaan van de woonplaats kunnen evenwel de uitkeringen eveneens door bemiddeling van laatstbedoeld orgaan voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend.     
2.  Het voorgaande lid is, wat het recht op verstrekkingen betreft, van overeenkomstige toepassing op de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat wonen.   
3.  De prestaties mogen aan grensarbeiders door het bevoegde orgaan ook op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat worden verleend volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, alsof zij op het grondgebied ervan woonden. Hun gezinsleden kunnen echter in dezelfde omstandigheden alleen verstrekkingen genieten wanneer tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen ter zake een overeenkomst bestaat, of, bij het ontbreken van een zodanige overeenkomst, na voorafgaande toestemming van het bevoegde orgaan, behoudens in spoedgevallen.   
4.  Indien in dit artikel bedoelde personen, behoudens grensarbeiders of hun gezinsleden, op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat verblijven, hebben zij recht op prestaties volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, alsof zij op het grondgebied ervan woonden, zelfs indien zij voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap reeds vóór de aanvang van hun verblijf prestaties hebben genoten.   
5.  Indien in dit artikel bedoelde personen hun woonplaats overbrengen naar het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat, hebben zij recht op prestaties volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, zelfs indien zij voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap reeds vóór de overbrenging van hun woonplaats prestaties hebben genoten.   

### Artikel  21  

1.  Personen die aan de door de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op prestaties voldoen, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 19, en 

a) wier gezondheidstoestand het nodig maakt dat onmiddellijk verstrekkingen worden verleend gedurende het verblijf op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat, of  

b) die, nadat zij voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan in het genot van prestaties zijn gesteld, van dit orgaan toestemming hebben ontvangen om terug te keren naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat, waarop zij wonen, of om hun woonplaats naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat over te brengen, of  

c) die van het bevoegde orgaan toestemming hebben ontvangen om zich naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat te begeven ten einde aldaar een voor hun gezondheidstoestand passende behandeling te ondergaan, hebben recht op: 

(i) verstrekkingen, welke voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats worden verleend volgens de door laatstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze personen daarbij waren aangesloten, doch gedurende ten hoogste het tijdvak dat eventueel in de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat is vastgesteld;  

(ii) uitkeringen, welke door het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze personen zich op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat bevonden. Na overeenstemming tussen het bevoegde orgaan en het orgaan van de woon- of verbrlijfplaats kunnen evenwel de uitkeringen eveneens door bemiddeling van laatstbedoeld orgaan voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend.       
2.  De sub b) van het vorige lid bedoelde toestemming mag slechts worden geweigerd indien verplaatsing van de betrokkene nadelig is voor zijn gezondheidstoestand of voor het ondergaan van een geneeskundige behandeling. De sub c) van het vorige lid bedoelde toestemming mag niet worden geweigerd wanneer de desbetreffende behandeling op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop hij woont, niet aan de betrokkene kan worden gegeven.   
3.  De vorige leden van dit artikel zijn, voor wat betreft het recht op verstrekkingen, van overeenkomstige toepassing op de gezinsleden.   

### Artikel  22  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verlenen van verstrekkingen aan gezinsleden afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat zij persoonlijk verzekerd zijn, zijn de artikelen 20 en 21 op de gezinsleden van een aan deze wettelijke regeling onderworpen persoon slechts van toepassing, indien zij hetzij bij hetzelfde orgaan van bedoelde Partij als deze persoon, hetzij bij een ander orgaan van bedoelde Partij, dat overeenkomstige verstrekkingen verleent, persoonlijk aangesloten zijn.   
2.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen gemiddelde verdiensten als grondslag worden genomen, stelt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij deze gemiddelde verdiensten uitsluitend vast op basis van de verdiensten welke gedurende de krachtens bedoelde wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken zijn uitbetaald.   
3.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van forfaitaire verdiensten, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij uitsluitend rekening met de forfaitaire verdiensten of eventueel met het gemiddelde van de forfaitaire verdiensten welke betrekking hebben op de krachtens bedoelde wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken.   
4.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het bedrag van de uitkeringen wisselt naar gelang van het aantal gezinsleden, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij eveneens rekening met de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, alsof zij op het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Partij woonden.   

### Artikel  23  

De werklozen die voldoen aan de voorwaarden voor het recht op verstrekkingen van de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij ten laste waarvan de werkloosheidsuitkeringen komen, hebben, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 19, evenals hun gezinsleden, recht op verstrekkingen, wanneer zij op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen. In dit geval worden de verstrekkingen verleend door het orgaan van de woonplaats volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof de betrokkene krachtens deze wettelijke regeling recht op verstrekkingen had; deze verstrekkingen komen echter voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan van eerstbedoelde Partij.  

### Artikel  24  

1.  Wanneer de rechthebbende op pensioenen of renten, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 19 recht heeft op verstrekkingen op grond van de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, worden aan deze rechthebbende en zijn gezinsleden door het orgaan van de woonplaats en voor rekening van dit orgaan verstrekkingen verleend, alsof hij uitsluitend recht had op een pensioen of een rente, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van laatstbedoelde Partij.   
2.  Wanneer de rechthebbende op een pensioen of rente, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij, of op pensioenen of renten, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, geen recht heeft op verstrekkingen op grond van de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, heeft hij, evenals zijn gezinsleden, niettemin recht op verstrekkingen, voor zover hij, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 19, recht heeft op verstrekkingen krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij of van één der eerstbedoelde Partijen, of daarop recht zou hebben indien hij op het grondgebied van één dezer Partijen zou wonen. De verstrekkingen worden door het orgaan van de woonplaats verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof de betrokkene krachtens deze wettelijke regeling recht op verstrekkingen had; deze verstrekkingen komen echter voor rekening van het overeenkomstig de in het volgende lid vermelde regels vast te stellen orgaan.   
3.  In de in het vorige lid bedoelde gevallen komen de verstrekkingen voor rekening van het overeenkomstig de volgende regels vast te stellen orgaan: 

a) indien de rechthebbende krachtens de wettelijke regeling van één Verdragsluitende Partij recht op bedoelde verstrekkingen heeft, komen deze voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij;  

b) indien de rechthebbende krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen recht heeft op bedoelde verstrekkingen, komen deze voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens de wettelijke regeling waarvan de rechthebbende het langste tijdvak van verzekering of wonen heeft vervuld; ingeval toepassing van deze regel ertoe leidt dat de verstrekkingen voor rekening van meer dan één orgaan komen, komen deze voor rekening van het orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij aan de wettelijke regeling waarvan de rechthebbende laatstelijk onderworpen is geweest.     
4.  Wanneer de gezinsleden van de rechthebbende op een pensioen of een rente, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij of op pensioenen of renten, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen dan deze rechthebbende, hebben zij recht op verstrekkingen alsof de rechthebbende op hetzelfde grondgebied als zij woonde, voor zover hij krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij recht op bedoelde verstrekkingen heeft. Deze verstrekkingen worden door het orgaan van de woonplaats van de gezinsleden verleend, volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof zij krachtens deze wettelijke regeling recht op verstrekkingen hadden; deze verstrekkingen komen echter voor rekening van het orgaan van de woonplaats van de rechthebbende.   
5.  Indien de in het vorige lid bedoelde gezinsleden hun woonplaats overbrengen naar het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij, waarop de rechthebbende woont, hebben zij recht op verstrekkingen volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Partij, zelfs indien zij vóór de overbrenging van hun woonplaats reeds verstrekkingen genoten hebben voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap.   
6.  De rechthebbende op een pensioen of een rente, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij, of op pensioenen of renten, verschuldigd krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, die recht heeft op verstrekkingen krachtens de wettelijke regeling van één van deze Partijen, heeft, evenals zijn gezinsleden, recht op verstrekkingen: 

a) gedurende een verblijf op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen, wanneer hun gezondheidstoestand het nodig maakt dat onmiddellijk verstrekkingen worden verleend, of  

b) wanneer zij van het orgaan van de woonplaats toestemming hebben ontvangen om zich naar het grondgebied te begeven van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen, teneinde aldaar een voor hun gezondheidstoestand passende behandeling te ondergaan.     
7.  In de in het vorige lid bedoelde gevallen worden de verstrekkingen verleend door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof de belanghebbende krachtens deze wettelijke regeling recht op verstrekkingen had; deze verstrekkingen komen echter voor rekening van het orgaan van de woonplaats van de rechthebbende.   
8.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij bepaalt dat voor rekening van een pensioen- of rentetrekker bijdragen of premies worden ingehouden in verband met het recht op verstrekkingen, is het orgaan van deze Partij dat een pensioen of rente verschuldigd is, gemachtigd deze bedragen in te houden, wanneer krachtens dit artikel de verstrekkingen voor rekening van een orgaan van bedoelde Partij komen.   

### Artikel  25  

1.  Indien de door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats toegepaste wettelijke regeling meer dan een verzekeringsstelsel voor ziekte of moederschap kent, worden in de gevallen, bedoeld in artikel 20, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 21, eerste en derde lid, artikel 23 en artikel 24, tweede, vierde en zesde lid, de voor het verlenen van verstrekkingen van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van het algemene stelsel, of, bij ontstentenis daarvan, die van het stelsel dat voor de werknemers in de industrie geldt, gevolgd.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij de toekenning van prestaties afhankelijk stelt van een voorwaarde met betrekking tot het land waar en het tijdstip waarop de aandoening is ontstaan, mag deze voorwaarde niet gesteld worden aan de personen op wie dit Verdrag van toepassing is, ongeacht op het grondgebied van welke Verdragsluitende Partij zij wonen.   
3.  Indien in de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij een maximale duur voor het verlenen van prestaties is vastgesteld, mag het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast, eventueel rekening houden met het tijdvak waarover voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap door het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij reeds prestaties werden verleend.   

### Artikel  26  

1.  De toepassing van de artikelen 20, 21, 23 en 24 tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen is afhankelijk van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Partijen, welke overeenkomsten bovendien bijzondere, aan de omstandigheden aangepaste regelingen mogen bevatten.   
2.  Bij de in het vorige lid bedoelde overeenkomsten wordt in het bijzonder het volgende vastgesteld: 

a) de groepen personen, op wie de artikelen 20, 21, 23 en 24 van toepassing zijn;  

b) het tijdvak waarover het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij verstrekkingen voor rekening van het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij kan verlenen;  

c) de bijzondere voorwaarden met betrekking tot het verlenen van prothesen, hulpmiddelen van grotere omvang en andere belangrijke verstrekkingen;  

d) de regels ter vermijding van samenloop van gelijksoortige prestaties;  

e) de wijze waarop de prestaties welke het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor rekening van het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij heeft verleend, worden vergoed.     
3.  Twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen overeenkomen dat van iedere vergoeding tussen de onder hun bevoegdheid vallende organen wordt afgezien.

Wanneer een persoon achtereenvolgens of afwisselend aan de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen onderwropen is geweest, hebben hij of zijn nagelaten betrekkingen recht op uitkeringen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk, zelfs ingeval de belanghebbenden, zonder dat deze bepalingen worden toegepast, aanspraak zouden kunnen maken op uitkeringen krachtens de wettelijke regeling van één of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

### Artikel  28  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede, in voorkomend geval, met de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van verzekering betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van wonen, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede, in voorkomend geval, met de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van wonen betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   
3.  Indien krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij op een persoon voor dezelfde eventualiteit, tegelijkertijd een stelsel van contributieve aard en een stelsel van niet-contributieve aard van toepassing is geweest, houdt, voor de toepassing van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel, het orgaan van iedere andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij rekening met het langste tijdvak van verzekering of van wonen, dat krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij is vervuld.   
4.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij de toekenning van bepaalde uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat de tijdvakken van verzekering in een aan een bijzonder stelsel onderworpen beroep, of eventueel in een bepaald beroep of met het verrichten van bepaalde werkzaamheden zijn vervuld, wordt voor de toekenning van deze uitkeringen slechts rekening gehouden met de tijdvakken welke krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn vervuld, indien deze tijdvakken krachtens een overeenkomstig stelsel, of bij afwezigheid daarvan, in hetzelfde beroep of eventueel met het verrichten van dezelfde werkzaamheden zijn vervuld. Indien de belanghebbende, met inachtneming van de aldus vervulde tijdvakken, niet voldoet aan de voor het rechtop bedoelde uitkeringen gestelde voorwaarden, wordt met deze tijdvakken rekening gehouden voor de toekenning van uitkeringen volgens het algemene stelsel of, bij afwezigheid daarvan, volgens het stelsel dat op arbeiders, respectievelijk bedienden van toepassing is.   
5.  Indien in de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij, welke voor het verkrijgen en het vaststellen van het recht op uitkeringen generlei eisen stelt omtrent de duur van de verzekering of de arbeid, de toekenning van uitkeringen afhankelijk wordt gesteld van de voorwaarde dat de belanghebbende, of indien er sprake is van uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen, de overledene, op het tijdstip waarop de verzekerde gebeurtenis zich heeft voorgedaan aan deze wettelijke regeling onderworpen was, wordt aan deze voorwaarde geacht te zijn voldaan indien de belanghebbende, respectievelijk de overledene, op dat tijdstip aan de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij onderworpen was.   
6.  Indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het tijdvak waarover een pensioen of rente wordt verleend in aanmerking mag worden genomen voor het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij daartoe rekening met het tijdvak waarover krachtens de wettelijke regeling van elke andere Verdragsluitende Partij een pensioen of rente werd verleend.   

### Artikel  29  

1.  Het orgaan van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan de wettelijke regeling op de betrokken persoon van toepassing is geweest, stelt overeenkomstig de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling vast of de belanghebbende aan de gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op uitkeringen voldoet, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 28.   
2.  Ingeval de belanghebbende aan deze voorwaarden voldoet, berekent bedoeld orgaan het theoretische bedrag van de uitkering waarop hij aanspraak zou kunnen maken indien alle tijdvakken van verzekering en van wonen welke zijn vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen en voor de vaststelling van het recht op uitkering in aanmerking zijn genomen overeenkomstig artikel 28, uitsluitend zouden zijn vervuld krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling.   
3.  Indien er echter sprake is van: 

a) uitkeringen waarvan het bedrag onafhankelijk is van de duur van de vervulde tijdvakken, wordt dit bedrag als het in het voorgaande lid bedoelde theoretische bedrag beschouwd;  

b) uitkeringen, genoemd in Bijlage IV, kan het in het voorgaande lid bedoelde theoretische bedrag worden berekend op basis van en tot hoogstens het bedrag van de volledige uitkering: 

(i) bij invaliditeit of overlijden, naar verhouding van de totale duur van de tijdvakken van verzekering en van wonen, welke door de belanghebbende of de overledene vóór het intreden van de verzekerde gebeurtenis zijn vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van alle betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen en overeenkomstig artikel 28 in aanmerking zijn genomen tot tweederde deel van het aantal jaren, liggende tussen het tijdstip waarop de belanghebbende of de overledene de 16-jarige leeftijd heeft bereikt en het tijdstip waarop de arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ingetreden, onderscheidenlijk het tijdstip waarop het overlijden heeft plaatsgevonden, zonder rekening te houden met jaren nà het bereiken van de pensioengerechtigde leeftijd;  

(ii) bij ouderdom, naar verhouding van de totale duur van de tijdvakken van verzekering en van wonen, welke door de belanghebbende zijn vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van alle betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen en overeenkomstig artikel 28 in aanmerking zijn genomen, tot 30 jaar, zonder rekening te houden met jaren na het bereiken van de pensioengerechtigde leeftijd.       
4.  Op basis van het overeenkomstig het tweede, respectievelijk het derde lid van dit artikel berekende theoretische bedrag stelt bedoeld orgaan vervolgens het werkelijke bedrag van de uitkering welke het aan de belanghebbende verschuldigd is, vast naar verhouding van de duur van de tijdvakken van verzekering of wonen, welke vóór het intreden van de verzekerde gebeurtenis krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld, tot de totale duur van de tijdvakken van verzekering en wonen, welke vóór het intreden van de verzekerde gebeurtenis krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van alle betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn vervuld.   
5.  Ingeval volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het bedrag van de uitkeringen of van bepaalde bestanddelen van uitkeringen evenredig is aan de duur van de vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering of wonen, kan het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij deze uitkeringen of bestanddelen van uitkeringen rechtstreeks berekenen en daarbij alleen rekening houden met de tijdvakken welke krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld, zonder dat de leden 2 tot en met 4 van dit artikel worden toegepast.   

### Artikel  30  

1.  De berekening van het in artikel 29, tweede lid, bedoelde theoretische bedrag vindt als volgt plaats: 

a) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van gemiddelde verdiensten, van een gemiddelde premie of bijdrage, van een gemiddelde verhoging of van de verhouding welke gedurende de tijdvakken van verzekering tussen de bruto-verdiensten van de betrokkene en de gemiddelde bruto-verdiensten van alle verzekerden met uitzondering van de leerlingen heeft bestaan, worden deze gemiddelden of verhoudingsgetallen door het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij uitsluitend vastgesteld op grond van de krachtens de wettelijke regeling van bedoelde Partij vervulde tijdvakken of van de door de betrokkene gedurende deze tijdvakken genoten bruto-verdiensten;  

b) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van het bedrag van de verdiensten, premies of bijdragen of eventuele verhogingen, worden de door het bevoegde orgaan van die Partij in aanmerking te nemen verdiensten, premies of bijdragen, of verhogingen, ten aanzien van de krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken vastgesteld op grond van het gemiddelde van de verdiensten, premies of bijdragen, of verhogingen welke betrekking hebben op krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij vervulde tijdvakken;  

c) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van forfaitaire verdiensten of een vast bedrag, zijn de door het bevoegde orgaan van die Partij in aanmerking te nemen verdiensten of is het door dit orgaan in aanmerking te nemen bedrag, ten aanzien van de krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken, gelijk aan de forfaitaire verdiensten of het vaste bedrag of eventueel aan het gemiddelde van de forfaitaire verdiensten of van de vaste bedragen welke betrekking hebben op de krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij vervulde tijdvakken;  

d) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij bij de berekening van de uitkeringen voor bepaalde tijdvakken wordt uitgegaan van het bedrag van de verdiensten en voor andere vakken van forfaitaire verdiensten of van een vast bedrag, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij ten aanzien van de krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken rekening met de overeenkomstig dit lid sub *b)* onderscheidenlijk sub *c)* vastgestelde verdiensten of bedragen; indien bij de berekening van de uitkeringen voor alle krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij vervulde tijdvakken wordt uitgegaan van forfaitaire verdiensten of een vast bedrag, zijn de door het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij in aanmerking te nemen verdiensten, ten aanzien van de krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken, gelijk aan de fictieve verdiensten welke met deze forfaitaire verdiensten of dit vaste bedrag overeenkomen.     
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voorschriften bevat inzake de aanpassing van de voor de berekening der uitkeringen in aanmerking genomen bestanddelen aan het loon- of prijsniveau, zijn deze voorschriften in voorkomend geval van toepassing op de bestanddelen waarmede het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij ten aanzien van de krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken overeenkomstig het vorige lid rekening heeft gehouden.   
3.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het bedrag van de uitkeringen wisselt naar gelang van het aantal gezinsleden, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij eveneens rekening met de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, alsof zij op het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Partij woonden.   

### Artikel  31  

1.  Indien de totale duur van de krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering of wonen minder dan een jaar bedraagt en indien, uitsluitend rekening houdende met deze tijdvakken, geen enkel recht op uitkeringen krachtens die wettelijke regeling bestaat, is het orgaan van die Partij, ongeacht het bepaalde in artikel 29, niet verplicht op grond van bedoelde tijdvakken uitkeringen toe te kennen.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van artikel 29, met uitzondering van het vierde lid, wordt met de in het vorige lid bedoelde tijdvakken wel rekening gehouden door het orgaan van elk der andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Ingeval toepassing van het eerste lid van dit artikel echter tot gevolg zou hebben dat alle betrokken organen van hun verplichting tot het toekennen van uitkeringen worden ontheven, worden de uitkeringen uitsluitend toegekend op grond van de wettelijke regeling van de laatste Verdragsluitende Partij aan de voorwaarden waarvan de betrokkene met inachtneming van artikel 28 voldoet, alsof alle in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tijdvakken krachents de wettelijke regeling van deze Partij waren vervuld.   

### Artikel  32  

1.  Indien de totale duur van de krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering of wonen ten minste een jaar maar minder dan vijf jaren bedraagt, is het orgaan van deze Partij, ongeacht het bepaalde in artikel 29, niet verplicht op grond van bedoelde tijdvakken ouderdomsuitkeringen toe te kennen.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van artikel 29 wordt met de in het vorige lid bedoelde tijdvakken door het orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij, krachtens de wettelijke regeling waarvan de betrokkene het langste tijdvak van verzekering of wonen heeft vervuld, rekening gehouden, alsof deze tijdvakken krachtens de wettelijke regeling van die Partij waren vervuld. Ingeval, volgens deze regel, bedoelde tijdvakken door meer dan één orgaan in aanmerking zouden moeten worden genomen, worden zij in aanmerking genomen door het orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij aan de wettelijke regeling waarvan de betrokkene laatstelijk onderworpen is geweest.   
3.  Het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde orgaan maakt aan het in het tweede lid bedoelde orgaan, ter finale kwijting, een som ineens over, die gelijk is aan het tienvoud van het jaarbedrag van het uitkeringsgedeelte dat laatstbedoeld orgaan overeenkomstig artikel 29 dient te verlenen op grond van de tijdvakken welke krachtens de door het eerstbedoelde orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld. De bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen overeenkomen hun geldelijke verplichtingen met betrekking tot deze tijdvakken op andere wijze te regelen.   
4.  Ingeval toepassing van het eerste lid van dit artikel echter tot gevolg zou hebben dat alle betrokken organen van hun verplichting tot het toekennen van uitkeringen worden ontheven, worden de uitkeringen overeenkomstig artikel 29 toegekend.   
5.  Ingeval gelijktijdige toepassing van artikel 31, eerste lid en het eerste lid van dit artikel tot gevolg zou hebben dat alle betrokken organen van hun verplichting tot het toekennen van uitkeringen worden ontheven, worden de uitkeringen overeenkomstig artikel 29 toegekend, onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 31, eerste en tweede lid.   
6.  De toepassing van de vorige leden van dit artikel tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen is afhankelijk van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Partijen en beperkt zich tot die gevallen, waarin de betrokkenen uitsluitend aan de wettelijke regelingen van deze Partijen onderworpen zijn geweest.   

### Artikel  33  

1.  Indien de betrokkene met inachtneming van artikel 28 op een bepaald tijdstip niet ten volle voldoet aan de voorwaarden welke door de wettelijke regelingen van alle betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen worden gesteld, doch uitsluitend voldoet aan de voorwaarden van één of meer van deze wettelijke regelingen, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a) het bedrag van de verschuldigde uitkeringen wordt door elk van de bevoegde organen welke een wettelijke regeling toepassen aan de voorwaarden waarvan is voldaan, berekend overeenkomstig artikel 29, tweede tot en met vierde lid, onderscheidenlijk vijfde lid;  

b) indien evenwel: 

(i) de betrokkene voldoet aan de voorwaarden van ten minste twee wettelijke regelingen zonder dat een beroep behoeft te worden gedaan op de tijdvakken van verzekering of wonen welke vervuld zijn krachtens de wettelijke regelingen aan de voorwaarden waarvan niet is voldaan, wordt voor de toepassing van artikel 29, tweede tot en met vierde lid, met deze tijdvakken geen rekening gehouden;  

(ii) de betrokkene voldoet aan de voorwaarden van één enkele wettelijke regeling, zonder dat een beroep behoeft te worden gedaan op het bepaalde in artikel 28, wordt het bedrag van de verschuldigde uitkering uitsluitend berekend overeenkomstig de wettelijke regeling aan de voorwaarden waarvan is voldaan, en uitsluitend rekening houdend met de krachtens deze wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken.       
2.  In het in het voorgaande lid bedoelde geval worden de krachtens één of meer van de betrokken wettelijke regelingen toegekende uitkeringen ambtshalve opnieuw berekend overeenkomstig artikel 29 tweede tot en met vierde lid, onderscheidenlijk vijfde lid, naarmate aan de door één of meer van de andere betrokken wettelijke regelingen gestelde voorwaarden wordt voldaan, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 28.   
3.  De krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen toegekende uitkeringen worden overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel op verzoek van de belanghebbenden opnieuw berekend, wanneer niet meer aan de door één of meer van deze wettelijke regelingen gestelde voorwaarden wordt voldaan.   

### Artikel  34  

1.  Indien het bedrag van de uitkeringen waarop de betrokkene zonder toepassing van de artikelen 28 tot en met 33 krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij aanspraak zou kunnen maken, hoger is dan het totale bedrag van de overeenkomstig deze artikelen verschuldigde uitkeringen, is het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij verplicht hem een aanvulling te verlenen, welke gelijk is aan het verschil tussen die beide bedragen. Deze aanvulling komt geheel voor rekening van dit orgaan.   
2.  Ingeval van toepassing van het vorige lid aan de betrokkene aanvullingen zouden moeten worden toegekend door de organen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, heeft hij uitsluitend recht op de hoogste aanvulling. De lasten van deze aanvulling worden omgeslagen over de bevoegde organen van deze Verdragsluitende Partijen, naar verhouding van het bedrag van de aanvulling dat elk van deze organen verschuldigd zou zijn indien het het enige daarbij betrokken orgaan was, tot het totale bedrag van de aanvullingen welke al deze organen zouden moeten verlenen.   
3.  De in de vorige leden van dit artikel bedoelde aanvulling wordt beschouwd als een bestanddeel van de uitkeringen, verleend door het orgaan dat de aanvulling verschuldigd is. Het bedrag van deze aanvulling wordt voor eens en altijd vastgesteld, behoudens het geval dat artikel 33, tweede of derde lid, zou moeten worden toegepast.   

### Afdeling  2:  

####Bijzondere bepalingen voor invaliditeit

### Artikel  35  

1.  Ingeval de invaliditeit van degene, die uitkeringen op grond van de wettelijke regeling van één enkele Verdragsluitende Partij geniet, toeneemt, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a) indien de betrokkene, sedert hij uitkeringen geniet, niet aan de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij onderworpen is geweest, is het bevoegde orgaan van eerstbedoelde Partij verplicht uitkeringen toe te kennen, volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, daarbij rekening houdende met de toeneming van de invaliditeit;  

b) indien de betrokkene, sedert hij uitkeringen geniet, aan de wettelijke regelingen van één of meer andere Verdragsluitende Partijen onderworpen is geweest, worden hem uitkeringen toegekend overeenkomstig de artikelen 28 tot en met 34, daarbij rekening houdende met de toeneming van de invaliditeit;  

c) in het in de vorige alinea bedoelde geval wordt het tijdstip waarop de toeneming van de invaliditeit is vastgesteld, beschouwd als het tijdstip waarop de verzekerde gebeurtenis zich heeft voorgedaan;  

d) indien de betrokkene, in het onder b) van dit lid bedoelde geval, geen recht op uitkeringen van het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij heeft, is het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstbedoelde Partij verplicht uitkeringen toe te kennen volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, daarbij rekening houdende met de toeneming van de invaliditeit.     
2.  Ingeval de invaliditeit van degene, die uitkeringen op grond van de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen geniet, toeneemt, worden hem uitkeringen toegekend overeenkomstig de artikelen 28 tot en met 34, daarbij rekening houdende met de toeneming van de invaliditeit. Het bepaalde onder c) van het vorige lid is van overeenkomstige toepassing.   

### Artikel  36  

1.  Indien de betaling van uitkeringen na schorsing moet worden hervat, geschiedt dit door het orgaan of door de organen welke de uitkeringen verschuldigd was of waren op het tijdstip waarop zij werden geschorst, onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 37.   
2.  Indien na intrekking van de uitkeringen de toestand van de betrokkene hernieuwde toekenning van uitkeringen rechtvaardigt, worden deze overeenkomstig de artikelen 28 tot en met 34 toegekend.   

### Artikel  37  

1.  De invaliditeitsuitkeringen worden eventueel in ouderdomsuitkeringen omgezet op de voorwaarden gesteld door de wettelijke regeling of de wettelijke regelingen krachtens welke zij zijn toegekend, en overeenkomstig de artikelen 28 tot en met 34.   
2.  Wanneer degene die in het genot is van invaliditeitsuitkeringen, verkregen krachtens de wettelijke regeling van één of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, aanspraak kan maken op ouderdomsuitkeringen, blijft, in het in artikel 33 bedoelde geval, elk orgaan dat invaliditeitsuitkeringen verschuldigd is, aan deze rechthebbende ook verder de uitkeringen verlenen waarop hij krachtens de door dat orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling recht heeft, en wel tot het tijdstip waarop het vorige lid door dit orgaan kan worden toegepast.   

### Hoofdstuk  3  

####Arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten

### Artikel  38  

1.  Werknemers die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat wonen en door een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte worden getroffen, hebben op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop zij wonen, recht op: 

a) verstrekkingen, welke voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan van de woonplaats worden verleend volgens de door laatstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze werknemers bij dat orgaan waren aangesloten;  

b) uitkeringen, welke door het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof deze werknemers op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat woonden. Na overeenstemming tussen het bevoegde orgaan en het orgaan van de woonplaats kunnen evenwel de uitkeringen eveneens door bemiddeling van laatstbedoeld orgaan voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend.     
2.  De prestaties mogen aan grensarbeiders door het bevoegde orgaan ook op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat worden verleend volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, alsof zij op het grondgebied ervan woonden.   
3.  Indien in dit artikel bedoelde werknemers, behoudens grensarbeiders, op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat verblijven, hebben zij recht op prestaties volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, alsof zij op het grondgebied ervan woonden, zelfs indien zij vóór de aanvang van hun verblijf reeds prestaties hebben genoten.   
4.  Indien in dit artikel bedoelde werknemers hun woonplaats naar het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat overbrengen, hebben zij recht op prestaties volgens de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat, zelfs indien zij vóór de overbrenging van hun woonplaats reeds prestaties hebben genoten.   

### Artikel  39  

Het ongeval op weg van of naar het werk dat op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat heeft plaatsgevonden, wordt geacht op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat te hebben plaatsgevonden.  

### Artikel  40  

1.  Degenen die door een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte zijn getroffen en 

a) op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat verblijven, of  

b) nadat zij voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan in het genot van prestaties zijn gesteld, van dit orgaan toestemming hebben ontvangen om terug te keren naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat, waarop zij wonen, of om hun woonplaats naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat over te brengen, of  

c) van het bevoegde orgaan toestemming hebben ontvangen om zich naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat te begeven teneinde aldaar een voor hun gezondheidstoestand passende behandeling te ondergaan, hebben recht op: 

(i) verstrekkingen, welke voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats worden verleend volgens de door laatstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof zij daarbij waren aangesloten, doch gedurende ten hoogste het tijdvak dat eventueel in de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat is vastgesteld;  

(ii) uitkeringen, welke door het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, alsof zij zich op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat bevonden. Na overeenstemming tussen het bevoegde orgaan en het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats kunnen evenwel de uitkeringen eveneens door bemiddeling van laatstbedoeld orgaan voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend.       
2.  

a) De sub b) van het vorige lid bedoelde toestemming mag slechts worden geweigerd indien verplaatsing van de betrokkene nadelig is voor zijn gezondheidstoestand of voor het ondergaan van een geneeskundige behandeling;  

b) De sub c) van het vorige lid bedoelde toestemming mag niet worden geweigerd wanneer de desbetreffende behandeling niet op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop hij woont, aan de betrokkene kan worden gegeven.     

### Artikel  41  

In de in artikel 38, eerste lid en artikel 40, eerste lid bedoelde gevallen kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen overeenkomen om het verlenen van prothesen, hulpmiddelen van grotere omvang en andere belangrijke verstrekkingen afhankelijk te stellen van de toestemming van het bevoegde orgaan.  

### Artikel  42  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat voorziet in het dragen van de kosten van vervoer van de getroffene naar zijn woning of naar het ziekenhuis, worden de kosten van vervoer van de getroffene naar een overeenkomstige plaats op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, waarop de getroffene woont, door het bevoegde orgaan gedragen volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, mits het orgaan vooraf toestemming tot dit vervoer heeft verleend, waarbij het naar behoren rekening houdt met de daarvoor geldende redenen.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat voorziet in het dragen van de kosten van vervoer van het stoffelijk overschot van de getroffene naar de begraafplaats, worden de kosten van vervoer van het stoffelijk overschot naar de begraafplaats op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, waarop de getroffene woonde, door het bevoegde orgaan gedragen, volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling.   
3.  De toepassing van de vorige leden van dit artikel tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen is afhankelijk van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Partijen. Bij deze overeenkomsten worden de groepen personen op wie deze leden van toepassing zijn vastgesteld, alsmede de wijze waarop de kosten van vervoer over de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen worden omgeslagen.   

### Artikel  43  

1.  Indien op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop de getroffene zich bevindt, geen verzekering tegen arbeidsongevallen of beroepsziekten bestaat, of indien een dergelijke verzekering wel bestaat doch niet voorziet in een orgaan dat verantwoordelijk is voor het verlenen van verstrekkingen worden deze verstrekkingen verleend door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats dat voor het verlenen van verstrekkingen in geval van ziekte verantwoordelijk is.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat het geheel kosteloos verlenen van verstrekkingen afhankelijk stelt van gebruikmaking van de door de werkgever opgerichte medische dienst, worden de verstrekkingen welke in de in artikel 38, eerste lid en artikel 40, eerste lid bedoelde gevallen worden verleend, geacht door een dergelijke medische dienst te zijn verleend.   
3.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat een regeling kent betreffende de verplichtingen van de werkgever, worden de verstrekkingen welke in de in artikel 38, eerste lid en artikel 40, eerste lid bedoelde gevallen worden verleend, geacht op verzoek van het bevoegde orgaan te zijn verleend.   
4.  Indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij bij de vaststelling van de mate van ongeschiktheid uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend rekening wordt gehouden met vroeger voorgekomen arbeidsongevallen of beroepsziekten, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij daartoe eveneens rekening met vroeger volgens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij erkende arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten, alsof zij onder de door het bevoegde orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling waren voorgekomen.   

### Artikel  44  

1.  Indien de door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats toegepaste wettelijke regeling meer dan één stelsel voor het verlenen van schadeloosstellingen kent, worden in de in artikel 38, eerste lid en artikel 40, eerste lid, bedoelde gevallen de voor het verlenen van verstrekkingen van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van het algemene stelsel, of, bij ontstentenis daarvan, die van het stelsel dat voor de werknemers in de industrie geldt, gevolgd.   
2.  Indien in de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij een maximale duur voor het verlenen van prestaties is vastgesteld mag het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast, eventueel rekening houden met het tijdvak waarover voor hetzelfde arbeidsongeval of dezelfde beroepsziekte door het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij reeds prestaties werden verleend.   

### Artikel  45  

1.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen gemiddelde verdiensten als grondslag worden genomen, stelt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij deze gemiddelde verdiensten uitsluitend vast op basis van de verdiensten welke gedurende de krachtens bedoelde wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken zijn uitbetaald.   
2.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van forfaitaire verdiensten, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij uitsluitend rekening met de forfaitaire verdiensten of eventueel met het gemiddelde van de forfaitaire verdiensten welke betrekking hebben op de krachtens bedoelde wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken.   
3.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het bedrag van de uitkeringen wisselt naar gelang van het aantal gezinsleden, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij eveneens rekening met de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, alsof zij op het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Partij woonden.   

### Artikel  46  

1.  Wanneer iemand die door een beroepsziekte getroffen is, onder de wettelijke regeling van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen werkzaamheden heeft verricht, waardoor deze ziekte kan zijn ontstaan, worden de uitkeringen waarop deze getroffene of zijn nagelaten betrekkingen aanspraak kunnen maken, uitsluitend toegekend op grond van de wettelijke regeling van de laatste van deze Verdragsluitende Partijen aan de voorwaarden waarvan zij blijken te voldoen, eventueel met inachtneming van het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het recht op uitkeringen wegens beroepsziekte afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat de desbetreffende ziekte het eerst op het grondgebied van die Partij medisch is vastgesteld, wordt deze voorwaarde geacht te zijn vervuld wanneer deze ziekte het eerst op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij is vastgesteld.   
3.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het recht op uitkeringen wegens beroepsziekte uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat de desbetreffende ziekte is vastgesteld binnen een bepaalde termijn na beëindiging van de laatste werkzaamheden waardoor een dergelijke ziekte kon ontstaan, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij, wanneer het nagaat op welk tijdstip die laatste werkzaamheden werden verricht, voor zover nodig rekening met gelijksoortige werkzaamheden welke onder de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn verricht, alsof zij onder de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren verricht.   
4.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het recht op uitkeringen wegens beroepsziekte uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat gedurende een bepaalde tijd werkzaamheden waardoor de desbetreffende ziekte kon ontstaan, werden verricht, houdt het bevoegde orgaan van deze Partij, voor zover nodig met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken waarin dergelijke werkzaamheden onder de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij werden verricht.   
5.  De toepassing van het derde en vierde lid van dit artikel tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen is afhankelijk van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Partijen. Bij deze overeenkomsten worden de beroepsziekten waarop genoemde leden van toepassing zijn, vastgesteld, alsmede de wijze waarop de lasten van de uitkeringen over de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen worden omgeslagen.   

### Artikel  47  

Wanneer iemand die door een beroepsziekte getroffen is schadeloosstelling geniet of genoten heeft voor rekening van het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij en hij, ingeval deze ziekte verergert, aanspraak maakt op uitkeringen bij het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a) indien de getroffene onder de wettelijke regeling van de tweede Partij geen werkzaamheden heeft uitgeoefend welke de desbetreffende beroepsziekte kunnen veroorzaken of verergeren, dient het bevoegde orgaan van de eerste Partij de uitkeringen voor zijn rekening te nemen volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de verergering;  

b) indien de getroffene onder de wettelijke regeling van de tweede Partij wel zodanige werkzaamheden heeft uitgeoefend, dient het bevoegde orgaan van de eerste Partij de uitkeringen voor zijn rekening te nemen volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, waarbij het geen rekening houdt met de verergering; het bevoegde orgaan van de tweede Partij kent de betrokkene een aanvulling toe, ter hoogte van het verschil tussen het bedrag van de uitkeringen welke na de verergering verschuldigd zijn en het bedrag van de uitkeringen welke vóór de verergering overeenkomstig de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling verschuldigd zouden zijn geweest, indien de desbetreffende beroepsziekte zich onder de wettelijke regeling van deze Partij had voorgedaan.    

### Artikel  48  

1.  Het bevoegde orgaan is verplicht het bedrag van de ingevolge artikel 38, eerste lid en artikel 40, eerste lid voor zijn rekening verleende verstrekkingen te vergoeden.   
2.  De in het vorige lid bedoelde vergoedingen worden vastgesteld en vinden plaats volgens tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen overeen te komen regelingen.   
3.  Twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen overeenkomen dat van iedere vergoeding tussen de onder hun bevoegdheid vallende organen wordt afgezien.

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen bij overlijden afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede, in voorkomend geval, met de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van verzekering betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen bij overlijden afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van wonen, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsmede, in voorkomend geval, met de tijdvakken van wonen welke na de 16-jarige leeftijd krachtens de wettelijke regeling van niet-contributieve aard van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van wonen betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   

### Artikel  50  

1.  Wanneer een persoon is overleden op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat, wordt het overlijden geacht te hebben plaatsgevonden op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat.   
2.  Het bevoegde orgaan dient de uitkeringen bij overlijden welke krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling verschuldigd zijn, toe te kennen zelfs indien de rechthebbende op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat woont.   
3.  De vorige leden van dit artikel zijn eveneens van toepassing wanneer het overlijden het gevolg is van een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte.   

### Hoofdstuk  5  

####Werkloosheid

### Artikel  51  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast, daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering, van dienstbetrekking of van beroepswerkzaamheden welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van verzekering betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld, op voorwaarde echter dat, indien het tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking of beroepswerkzaamheden betreft, deze tijdvakken als tijdvakken van verzekering zouden zijn beschouwd indien zij krachtens laatstbedoelde wettelijke regeling waren vervuld.   
2.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij de toekenning van uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van verzekering, van dienstbetrekking of van beroepswerkzaamheden welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.   
3.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij de toekenning van bepaalde uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de voorwaarde dat de tijdvakken van verzekering in een aan een bijzonder stelsel onderworpen beroep zijn vervuld, wordt voor de toekenning van deze uitkeringen slechts rekening gehouden met de tijdvakken welke krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn vervuld, indien deze tijdvakken krachtens een overeenkomstig stelsel, of bij afwezigheid daarvan, in hetzelfde beroep zijn vervuld. Indien de belanghebbende, met inachtneming van de aldus vervulde tijdvakken, niet voldoet aan de voor het recht op bedoelde uitkeringen gestelde voorwaarden, wordt met deze tijdvakken rekening gehouden voor de toekenning van uitkeringen volgens het algemene stelsel.   
4.  Toepassing van de vorige leden van dit artikel wordt afhankelijk gesteld van de voorwaarde dat op de belanghebbende laatstelijk de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op grond waarvan de uitkeringen worden aangevraagd, van toepassing is geweest, behalve in de gevallen, bedoeld in artikel 53, eerste lid, sub a), ii) en b, ii).   

### Artikel  52  

Werklozen die ten aanzien van de vervulling van tijdvakken van verzekering, van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 51 voldoen aan de door de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op uitkeringen en hun woonplaats naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij overbrengen, worden eveneens geacht te voldoen aan de in dit opzicht door de wettelijke regeling van laatstbedoelde Partij gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op uitkering, mits zij binnen dertig dagen na het overbrengen van hun woonplaats een aanvrage bij het orgaan van hun nieuwe woonplaats indienen. De uitkeringen worden door het orgaan van de woonplaats verleend volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling en voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan van eerstbedoelde Partij.  

### Artikel  53

a) 

(i) een grensarbeider die in de onderneming waarin hij werkzaam is, gedeeltelijk of door onvoorziene omstandigheden werkloos is, heeft, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 51, recht op uitkeringen volgens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat, alsof hij op het grondgebied van die Staat woonde; deze uitkeringen worden door het bevoegde orgaan verleend;  

(ii) een volledig werkloze grensarbeider heeft, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 51, recht op uitkeringen volgens de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, alsof die wettelijke regeling tijdens het verrichten van zijn laatste werkzaamheden op hem van toepassing was geweest; deze uitkeringen worden door het orgaan van de woonplaats verleend;    

b) 

(i) een werknemer die geen grensarbeider is en gedeeltelijk, door onvoorziene omstandigheden of volledig werkloos is, doch ter beschikking blijft van zijn werkgever of van de diensten voor arbeidsbemiddeling op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat, heeft, eventueel met inachtneming van artikel 51, recht op uitkeringen volgens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat, alsof hij op het grondgebied van die Staat woonde; deze uitkeringen worden door het bevoegde orgaan verleend;

Indien, in de in de artikelen 52 en 53, eerste lid, sub b) iii) bedoelde gevallen, in de door het orgaan van de woonplaats toegepaste wettelijke regeling een maximale duur voor het verlenen van uitkeringen is vastgesteld, mag dit orgaan eventueel rekening houden met het tijdvak waarover door het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij reeds uitkeringen werden verleend, nadat het recht op uitkeringen voor de laatste maal werd vastgesteld.  

### Artikel  55  

1.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij bepaalt dat voor de berekening van de uitkeringen wordt uitgegaan van het bedrag van de vroegere verdiensten, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast uitsluitend rekening met de door de betrokkene genoten verdiensten voor de laatste werkzaamheden welke hij op het grondgebied van die Partij heeft verricht, of, indien de betrokkene laatstelijk niet gedurende ten minste vier weken werkzaamheden op dit grondgebied heeft verricht, met de verdiensten welke ter plaatse waar de werkloze woont met gelijkwaardige of soortgelijke werkzaamheden als die welke hij het laatst op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij heeft verricht, gewoonlijk worden genoten.   
2.  Indien ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het bedrag van de uitkeringen wisselt naar gelang van het aantal gezinsleden, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast eveneens rekening met de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, alsof zij op het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Partij woonden.   
3.  Indien volgens de door het orgaan van de woonplaats toegepaste wettelijke regeling de uitkeringsduur afhankelijk is van de duur van de vervulde tijdvakken, wordt de uitkeringsduur eventueel vastgesteld met inachtneming van artikel 51, eerste of tweede lid.   

### Artikel  56

### Hoofdstuk  6  

####Gezinsuitkeringen

### Artikel  57  

Indien de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij het verkrijgen van het recht op uitkeringen afhankelijk stelt van de vervulling van tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen, houdt het orgaan dat deze wettelijke regeling toepast daartoe, voor zover nodig, met het oog op de samentelling van tijdvakken, rekening met de tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld, alsof het tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking, van beroepswerkzaamheden of van wonen betrof welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van eerstbedoelde Partij waren vervuld.  

### Artikel  58  

1.  De toepassing van de eerste of de tweede afdeling van dit hoofdstuk tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen is afhankelijk van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Partijen, welke overeenkomsten bovendien bijzondere, aan de omstandigheden aangepaste regelingen mogen bevatten.

b) wettige, gewettigde, natuurlijke erkende en aangenomen kinderen en ouderloze kleinkinderen van de echtgeno (o) t (e) van de gerechtigde, mits zij tot het huishouden van de gerechtigde behoren en op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij wonen.     
2.  Personen, op wie de wettelijke regeling van een Verdragsluitende Partij van toepassing is, die kinderen hebben die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen of worden opgevoed, hebben voor deze kinderen recht op kinderbijslagen waarin de wettelijke regeling van de eerste Partij voorziet, alsof die kinderen op het grondgebied van deze Partij woonden of werden opgevoed.   
3.  In het in het vorige lid bedoelde geval mag het bedrag van de kinderbijslagen evenwel worden beperkt tot het bedrag van de kinderbijslagen waarin de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de kinderen wonen of worden opgevoed, voorziet.   
4.  Bij toepassing van het vorige lid wordt bij de vergelijking van de kinderbijslagbedragen ingevolge de beide betrokken wettelijke regelingen rekening gehouden met het totale aantal kinderen dat van dezelfde gerechtigde afhankelijk is. Indien de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de kinderen wonen of worden opgevoed, voorziet in verschillende kinderbijslagbedragen voor verschillende groepen gerechtigden, wordt rekening gehouden met de bedragen welke verschuldigd zouden zijn, indien op de gerechtigde deze wettelijke regeling van toepassing was.

Werklozen die voor rekening van het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij in het genot zijn van werkloosheidsuitkeringen en kinderen hebben die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen of worden opgevoed, hebben voor deze kinderen recht op kinderbijslagen waarin de wettelijke regeling van de eerste Partij in deze omstandigheid voorziet, alsof die kinderen op het grondgebied van deze Partij woonden of werden opgevoed.   
2.  In het in het vorige lid bedoelde geval is artikel 59, eerste, derde, vierde en zesde lid van overeenkomstige toepassing.

De gezinsuitkeringen worden aan de gezinsleden voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan van eerstbedoelde Partij verleend door het orgaan van hun woonplaats, volgens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling.  

### Artikel  63

### Artikel  65  

1.  De vrijstelling of verlaging van rechten, zegelrechten, griffie- of registratierechten waarin bij de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij is voorzien voor bescheiden of documenten welke ter uitvoering van de wetgeving van deze Partij dienen te worden overgelegd, geldt eveneens voor overeenkomstige bescheiden of documenten welke ter uitvoering van de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of van dit Verdrag dienen te worden overgelegd.

2.  Aanvragen, verklaringen of beroepschriften welke volgens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij binnen een bepaalde termijn moeten worden ingediend bij een autoriteit, een orgaan of een rechterlijke instantie van die Partij, zijn ontvankelijk indien zij binnen dezelfde termijn bij een autoriteit, orgaan of rechterlijke instantie van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij worden ingediend. In dat geval zal de autoriteit, het orgaan of de rechterlijke instantie waarop aldus een beroep wordt gedaan, deze aanvragen, verklaringen of beroepschriften onverwijld doen toekomen aan de bevoegde autoriteit, het bevoegde orgaan of de bevoegde rechterlijke instantie van eerstbedoelde Partij, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door bemiddeling van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen. De datum waarop die aanvragen, verklaringen of beroepschriften bij een autoriteit, een orgaan of een rechterlijke instantie van de andere Partij zijn ingediend, wordt beschouwd als de datum waarop deze zijn ingediend bij de autoriteit, het orgaan of de rechterlijke instantie welke bevoegd is hiervan kennis te nemen.

### BIJLAGE  VII  

####(Artikel 72, eerste lid)

###Bijzonderheden inzake de toepassing van de wetgevingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen

### I  

####Toepassing van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving

### A  

####Toepassing van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake de ziekteverzekering, de verzekering tegen arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten en de pensioenverzekering

1. Artikel 8, eerste lid van dit Verdrag en de overeenkomstige bepalingen van de in Bijlage III genoemde bilaterale verdragen laten onverlet de bepalingen van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake verkregen aanspraken of toekomstige rechten uit de pensioenverzekering en de verzekering tegen arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten op grond van in het buitenland verrichte werkzaamheden en eveneens de bepalingen inzake het in aanmerking nemen van op het grondgebied van de voormalige Oostenrijks-Hongaarse Monarchie buiten het grondgebied van de Republiek Oostenrijk vervulde tijdvakken van zelfstandige beroepsarbeid.  

2. Artikel 8, eerste lid van dit Verdrag laat onverlet de bepalingen inzake verzekeringslasten opgenomen in tussen Oostenrijk en andere staten gesloten bilaterale verdragen.  

3. Op grond van artikel 8, eerste lid van dit Verdrag, worden voor onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen de volgende tijdvakken als gelijkgestelde tijdvakken aangemerkt, onverminderd de overige voorwaarden: 

a) met betrekking tot de eerste wereldoorlog, de tijdvakken van krijgsdienst in het Oostenrijk-Hongaarse leger of in het leger van een staat, welke met de Oostenrijks-Hongaarse Monarchie geallieerd was, alsmede de daarmede gelijkgestelde tijdvakken van gevangenschap (internering) en daaropvolgende repatriëring;  

b) met betrekking tot de tweede wereldoorlog, de tijdvakken van krijgsdienst in de strijdkrachten van het voormalige Duitse Rijk en zijn geallieerden, de tijdvakken van militaire dienst of arbeidsdienst, alsmede de daarmede gelijkgestelde tijdvakken van eerste hulpdienst of luchtbeschermingsdienst, van gevangenschap (internering) en daaropvolgende repatriëring.    

4. Voorzover krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving, het genot van prestaties inzake sociale verzekering of van inkomsten van andere aard, het verrichten van beroepswerkzaamheden of het bestaan van een rechtsverhouding op het gebied der sociale verzekering wettelijke gevolgen heeft voor het recht op prestaties, voor de verlening van prestaties, voor de verzekeringsplicht of voor de toelating tot de vrijwillige verzekering, heeft het genot van deze prestaties, het verwerven van deze inkomsten, het verrichten van deze werkzaamheden of het bestaan van de rechtsverhouding op het grondgebied van of ingevolge de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, dezelfde gevolgen.  

5. Als neutrale tijdvakken in de zin van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving worden voor het verkrijgen, het behoud of het herstel van het recht op prestaties eveneens beschouwd overeenkomstige tijdvakken welke krachtens de wetgeving van enige andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vervuld.  

6. Het bepaalde in Titel III, Hoofdstuk 2 van dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op prestaties uit de pensioenverzekering voor zelfstandigen in de handel en op prestaties uit de aanvullende pensioenverzekering in de landbouw, toegekend aan personen die ten tijde van het inwerkingtreden van de toepasselijke wettelijke bepalingen reeds een bepaalde leeftijd overschreden hadden.  

7. Om vast te stellen krachtens welk stelsel van de Oostenrijkse pensioenverzekering recht op prestaties bestaat en welk orgaan bevoegd is voor het verlenen van prestaties, worden de krachtens de wetgevingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering in aanmerking genomen volgens de aard van de gedurende die tijdvakken verrichte beroepsarbeid. Tijdvakken van verzekering gedurende welke geen beroepsarbeid werd verricht, worden in aanmerking genomen volgens de aard van de beroepsarbeid welke laatstelijk vóór deze tijdvakken werd verricht; indien de aard van de beroepsarbeid niet kan worden vastgesteld of indien tijdens de duur van de verzekering nimmer beroepsarbeid werd verricht, worden deze tijdvakken van verzekering in aanmerking genomen alsof daaraan omstandigheden ten grondslag lagen waarvoor het sociale verzekeringsorgaan voor arbeiders bevoegd was. Tijdvakken gedurende welke ter zake van invaliditeit of ouderdom recht bestaat of heeft bestaan op grond van de verzekering van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij worden in aanmerking genomen volgens de aard van de laatstelijk, voor het intreden van de verzekerde gebeurtenis verrichte beroepsarbeid. Om vast te stellen of er aanspraak bestaat op prestaties uit het Oostenrijkse stelsel inzake de pensioenverzekering voor mijnwerkers, worden de krachtens de wetgevingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering slechts in aanmerking genomen voorzover het tijdvakken in de zin van artikel 28, vierde lid van dit Verdrag betreft.  

8. Tijdvakken van verzekering welke niet zijn vervuld, doch krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving als tijdvakken van verzekering dienen te worden beschouwd, worden in aanmerking genomen alsof zij krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving werden vervuld.  

9. Wanneer, in gevallen waarin de referentiedatum voor 1 januari 1962 ligt, met toepassing van artikel 30, eerste lid, sub a) van dit Verdrag, krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving de premiegrondslag voor de berekening van de pensioengrondslag niet kan worden vastgesteld, wordt de premiegrondslag vastgesteld door het loon, dat een werknemer van dezelfde soort op 31 december 1946 gewoonlijk verdiende, te vermenigvuldigen met de krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving vastgestelde coëfficiënt, tot ten hoogste de maximale premiegrondslag, geldend voor het betrokken tijdvak.  

10. Bij de vaststelling van het theoretische bedrag ingevolge artikel 29, tweede lid van dit Verdrag, dient met de op grond van wetgevingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken van verzekering rekening te worden gehouden zonder daarbij de bepalingen van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake de in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken van verzekering toe te passen.  

11. Bij toepassing van artikel 29, tweede en vierde lid van dit Verdrag gelden de volgende regels: 

a) met elkaar overlappende tijdvakken wordt rekening gehouden binnen de grenzen van hun duur;  

b) de vereffeningstoelagen krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving dienen te worden berekend nadat het bedrag van de verschuldigde uitkeringen is vastgesteld.    

12. Wanneer bij de berekening van het bedrag van de Oostenrijkse aanvulling het maximale aantal maanden van verzekering in aanmerking moet worden genomen, moet de in artikel 29, vierde lid van dit Verdrag bedoelde verhouding worden vastgesteld op basis van alle tijdvakken van verzekering welke voor de berekening van het theoretische bedrag in aanmerking zijn genomen, zonder met dit maximale aantal rekening te houden.  

13. De bepalingen van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake schorsing van de pensioenen bij verblijf van de rechthebbende in het buitenland, moeten worden toegepast na de vaststelling van de gedeeltelijke uitkering, terwijl de bepalingen welke betrekking hebben op andere omstandigheden vóór de vaststelling van de gedeeltelijke uitkering moeten worden toegepast.  

14. Tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens de wetgevingen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, worden niet in aanmerking genomen voor wat betreft het recht op en de toekenning van de premie wegens lang dienstverband voor mijnwerkers.  

15. De toelage wegens hulpbehoevendheid moet krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving worden berekend op basis van het met toepassing van artikel 29, vierde lid van dit Verdrag vastgestelde bedrag van de Oostenrijkse uitkering, binnen de grenzen van het maximale bedrag, gereduceerd overeenkomstig de in dit lid bedoelde verhouding; indien de toelage wegens hulpbehoevendheid een vast bedrag is, wordt dit bedrag gereduceerd overeenkomstig de in artikel 29, vierde lid bedoelde verhouding. Wanneer krachtens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving recht op uitkering is ontstaan zonder een beroep te doen op artikel 28, eerste lid van dit Verdrag, dient het maximale bedrag (of het vaste bedrag) niet te worden gereduceerd, tenzij krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een toelage wegens hulpbehoevendheid of een soortgelijke uitkering wordt toegekend.  

16. De bijzondere pensioenbetalingen ingevolge de Oostenrijkse pensioenverzekering worden naar hetzelfde bedrag uitbetaald als de krachtens artikel 29, vierde lid van dit Verdrag vastgestelde uitkering; artikel 34 van dit Verdrag is van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

17. Artikel 28, eerste lid van het Verdrag wordt volgens de Oostenrijkse wetgeving niet toegepast op aanvragen om vervroegd ouderdomspensioen bij werkloosheid of lange verzekeringsduur, zoals in deze wetgeving is voorzien.    

### B  

####Toepassing van de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake de werkloosheidsverzekering

1. Artikel 8, eerste lid van dit Verdrag laat onverlet de Oostenrijkse wetgeving inzake bijstand voor werklozen.  

2. Artikel 51, eerste en tweede lid van dit Verdrag betreffende de samentelling van tijdvakken is niet van toepassing voor het verkrijgen van recht op uitkering bij bevallingsverlof.    

### II  

####Toepassing van de Deense wetgeving

Voor wat betreft de werkloosheidsuitkeringen zegt de Deense regering toe dat zij er bij de erkende werkloosheidskassen op aan zal dringen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, voorzover van kracht ten aanzien van Denemarken, toe te passen.  

### III  

####Toepassing van de Franse wetgeving

1. Het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling, neergelegd in artikel 8 van dit Verdrag, is niet van toepassing op Wet no. 65-555 van 10 juli 1965, waarbij aan de Fransen die in het buitenland al of niet betaalde beroepsarbeid verrichten of hebben verricht, de bevoegdheid wordt verleend tot de vrijwillige ouderdomsverzekering toe te treden.  

2. Met toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt het recht op de uitkering voor bejaarde werknemers, op de niet-contributieve ouderdomsuitkeringen voor niet-loontrekkenden en op de bijzondere uitkering alleen verkregen door personen die aantonen dat zij in het tijdvak liggend tussen de leeftijd van 16 jaar en de leeftijd waarop zij voor genoemde uitkeringen in aanmerking komen, gedurende tenminste tien jaar in Frankrijk hebben gewoond, waarvan vijf jaar aaneengesloten onmiddellijk voor de aanvraag om uitkeringen.  

3. Dit Verdrag laat onverlet de bepalingen van de Franse wetgeving krachtens welke voor het recht op de uitkering voor bejaarde werknemers en op de niet-contributieve ouderdomsuitkeringen voor niet-loontrekkenden, de tijdvakken van beroepswerkzaamheden welke op Frans grondgebied zijn vervuld in aanmerking worden genomen.  

4. De bijzondere uitkering en de voor cumulatie vatbare uitkering, waarin het sociale zekerheidsstelsel voor de mijnwerkers voorziet, worden alleen verleend aan degenen die in de Franse mijnen werken.  

5. Het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling, neergelegd in artikel 8 van dit Verdrag, is niet van toepassing op de wetgeving inzake de inkomstengaranties voor werknemers die hun dienstbetrekking verliezen. Het recht op uitkeringen ingevolge deze wetgeving is afhankelijk van de voorwaarde dat de belanghebbende gedurende drie maanden onmiddellijk voor de aanvraag om uitkeringen in Frankrijk heeft gewoond.    

### IV  

####Toepassing van de wetgeving van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland

1. 

a) Voorzover schadeloosstelling niet reeds in de Duitse wettelijke regeling inzake de verplichte ongevallenverzekering is voorgeschreven verlenen de Duitse organen, zolang de getroffene of zijn nagelaten betrekkingen op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, eveneens een schadeloosstelling aan de in Elzas-Lotharingen vóór 1 januari 1919 door arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten getroffenen of hun nagelaten betrekkingen, wanneer deze schadeloosstelling niet overeenkomstig het besluit van de Raad van de Volkenbond van 21 juni 1921 (Reichsgesetzblatt, blz. 1289) door de Franse organen is overgenomen.  

b) Artikel 11 van dit Verdrag laat onverlet de bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving krachtens welke de buiten het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland voorgekomen ongevallen en beroepsziekten, alsmede de buiten dit grondgebied vervulde tijdvakken, niet of slechts onder bepaalde voorwaarden aanleiding geven tot het verlenen van uitkeringen wanneer de rechthebbenden buiten het grondied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland wonen.    

2. 

a) Om vast te stellen of tijdvakken welke krachtens de Duitse wetgeving moeten worden beschouwd als premievrije tijdvakken (Ausfallzeiten) of aanvullende tijdvakken (Zurechnungszeiten) als zodanig in aanmerking moeten worden genomen, worden de krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht betaalde premies of bijdragen en de aansluiting bij de pensioenverzekering van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij gelijkgesteld met de krachtens de Duitse wetgeving verplicht betaalde premies of bijdragen en met de aansluiting bij de Duitse pensioenverzekering. Bij de berekening van het aantal kalendermaanden liggende tussen de datum van aansluiting bij de verzekering en de datum waarop de verzekerde gebeurtenis heeft plaatsgevonden, wordt geen rekening gehouden met de krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij gelijkgestelde tijdvakken welke tussen deze beide data zijn gelegen en evenmin met de tijdvakken waarover de belanghebbende een pensioen of rente heeft genoten.  

b) De vorige alinea is niet van toepassing op de vaste premievrije tijdvakken (pauschale Ausfallzeit).  

c) Voor het in aanmerking nemen van een aanvullend tijdvak (Zurechnungszeit) krachtens de Duitse wettelijke regeling inzake de pensioenverzekering voor mijnwerkers, geldt bovendien als voorwaarde dat de laatste premie of bijdrage die krachtens de Duitse wetgeving is betaald, aan de pensioenverzekering voor mijnwerkers moet zijn betaald.  

d) Voor het in aanmerking nemen van de Duitse vervangende tijdvakken (Ersatzzeiten) is alleen de Duitse wetgeving van toepassing.    

3. 

a) Bij cumulatie van een pensioen wegens beroepsinvaliditeit (Berufsunfähigkeit) of algemene invaliditeit (Erwerbsunfähigkeit) of een ouderdomspensioen, verschuldigd krachtens de Duitse wetgeving, met een rente wegens arbeidsongeval of beroepsziekte, verschuldigd krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt als jaarlijkse beloning in aanmerking genomen de beloning welke ten tijde van het ongeval krachtens de Duitse wetgeving in aanmerking zou moeten worden genomen voor een getroffene die zich in een vergelijkbare situatie bevindt; daartoe dienen de in de woonplaats van de belanghebbende op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland geldende bepalingen te worden toegepast, of, indien deze buiten dit grondgebied woont, de in de plaats van vestiging van het bevoegde Duitse pensioen verzekeringsorgaan geldende bepalingen. De beloning van de betrokken getroffene moet volgens de bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving worden vastgesteld of herberekend.  

b) Het totaal van de rente van de ongevallenverzekering en het theoretische bedrag van de uitkering in de zin van artikel 29, tweede lid van dit Verdrag, met uitsluiting van aanvullende uitkeringen, toeslagen voor kinderen en verhogingen van de aanvullende verzekering (Höherversicherung), wordt vergeleken met het maximumedrag dat met toepassing van de vorige alinea in aanmerking wordt genomen; het bedrag waarmede dit totaal het betreffende maximumedrag overschrijdt, vormt het fictieve bedrag van de vermindering. Dit laatste bedrag wordt naar verhouding van de verzekeringsduur, volgens het bepaalde in artikel 29, vierde lid van dit Verdrag evenredig verdeeld; het deel dat betrekking heeft op de Duitse verzekeringsduur moet van het Duitse prorata-bedrag worden afgetrokken,    

4. Voor wat betreft de intrekking van de vereffeningsuitkering van het stelsel voor mijnwerkers, worden mijnbouwondernemingen op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij gelijkgesteld met Duitse mijnbouwondernemingen.  

5. Duitse pensioenverzekeringsorganen passen artikel 29, vijfde lid van dit Verdrag toe, wanneer 

a) de voor 1 januari 1957 geldende wetgeving inzake pensioenberekening van toepassing is;  

b) een aanvullend tijdvak (Zurechnungszeit) in aanmerking moet worden genomen; of  

c) een toeslag voor kinderen in aanmerking moet worden genomen.    

6. Titel III, Hoofdstuk 2 van dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op de pensioenverzekering in de ijzer- en staalindustrie en op het stelsel inzake hulpverlening aan bejaarde landbouwers.    

### V  

####Toepassing van de Luxemburgse wetgeving

In afwijking van artikel 74, derde lid van dit Verdrag, worden de tijdvakken van verzekering en de daarmede gelijkgestelde tijdvakken welke vóór 1 januari 1946 krachtens de Luxemburgse wetgeving inzake pensioenverzekering (invaliditeit, ouderdom en overlijden) zijn vervuld, voor de toepassing van deze wetgeving slechts in aanmerking genomen voorzover de in opbouw zijnde rechten ten tijde van het inwerkingtreden van dit Verdrag uitsluitend overeenkomstig deze wetgeving of overeenkomstig van kracht zijnde of nog te sluiten bilaterale verdragen inzake sociale zekerheid gehandhaafd zullen zijn of nadien hersteld zullen worden. Ingeval meer dan één verdrag van toepassing is, zullen de tijdvakken van verzekering en de daarmede gelijkgestelde tijdvakken van de vroegste datum af in aanmerking worden genomen.  

### VI  

####Toepassing van de Nederlandse wetgeving

### A  

####Toepassing van de Nederlandse algemene ouderdomswet

1. Voor de toepassing van artikel 29 van dit Verdrag worden als tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens de Nederlandse algemene ouderdomswet, mede aangemerkt tijdvakken, gelegen vóór 1 januari 1957 gedurende welke de rechthebbende die niet voldoet aan de voorwaarden op grond waarvan deze tijdvakken kunnen worden gelijkgesteld met tijdvakken van verzekering, na het bereiken van de 15-jarige leeftijd op Nederlands grondgebied heeft gewoond of gedurende welke hij, op het grondgebied van een andere Verdrag sluitende Partij wonende, in Nederland arbeid heeft verricht in dienst van een in Nederland gevestigde werkgever.  

2. De krachtens het vorige lid in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken, welke samenvallen met tijdvakken welke in acht worden genomen bij de berekening van het ouderdomspensioen dat krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij verschuldigd is, worden buiten beschouwing gelaten.  

3. Wat de gehuwde vrouw betreft, wier echtgenoot recht heeft op een pensioen krachtens de Nederlandse algemene ouderdomswet, worden ook in aanmerking genomen tijdvakken, gelegen vóór de datum waarop zij de 65-jarige leeftijd heeft bereikt en gedurende welke zij, gehuwd zijnde, tijdens dit huwelijk op het grondgebied van een of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft gewoond, voor zover deze tijdvakken samenvallen met de door haar echtgenoot krachtens bedoelde wet vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering en met de krachtens het eerste lid in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken.  

4. De ingevolge het vorige lid ten aanzien van een gehuwde vrouw in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken welke samenvallen met tijdvakken, welke in acht worden genomen bij de berekening van het haar krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij verschuldigde ouderdomspensioen of met tijdvakken, gedurende welke zij ingevolge een zodanige wettelijke regeling ouderdomspensioen heeft genoten, worden buiten beschouwing gelaten.  

5. Wat de gehuwd geweest zijnde vrouw betreft, wier echtgenoot onderworpen is geweest aan de Nederlandse algemene ouderdomswet of geacht wordt tijdvakken van verzekering in de zin van het eerste lid te hebben vervuld, is het bepaalde in de beide voorgaande leden van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

6. De voor 1 januari 1957 gelegen tijdvakken worden bij de berekening van het ouderdomspensioen slechts in aanmerking genomen, indien de belanghebbende na het bereiken van de 59-jarige leeftijd gedurende zes jaren op het grondgebied van een of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft gewoond en indien hij op het grondgebied van een dezer Partijen woont.    

### B  

####Toepassing van de Nederlandse Algemene Weduwen- en Wezenwet

2. De krachtens het vorige lid in aanmerking te nemen tijdvakken welke samenvallen met tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij inzake uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen, worden buiten beschouwing gelaten.    

### C  

####Toepassing van de Nederlandse wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering

1. Voor de toepassing van artikel 29 van dit Verdrag worden als tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens de Nederlandse wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering mede aangemerkt de vóór 1 juli 1967 in Nederland vervulde tijdvakken van arbeid in loondienst en de daarmede gelijkgestelde tijdvakken.  

2. Indien bedoelde tijdvakken in Nederland uitsluitend voor 1 juli 1967 zijn vervuld, worden de verdiensten waarop de berekening van de uitkeringen berust, vastgesteld op basis van de bedragen, zoals deze zijn voorzien in de Wet van 2 februari 1967, houdende overgangsregeling arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering, aangepast aan de ontwikkeling van het indexcijfer der lonen sedert 1 juli 1967.  

3. Artikel 35, eerste lid, sub a) en d) van dit Verdrag wordt door de Nederlandse organen niet toegepast op uitkeringen, berekend naar een arbeidsongeschiktheid van minder dan 45%, indien de toeneming van de vooraf bestaande arbeidsongeschiktheid kennelijk is voortgekomen uit een andere oorzaak dan die, waaruit de ongeschiktheid, ter zake waarvan uitkering wordt genoten, is voortgekomen.    

### D  

####Toepassing van de Nederlandse wetgeving inzake vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering

Het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling, neergelegd in artikel 8 van dit Verdrag, is niet van toepassing op de vrijwillig voortgezette ouderdomsverzekering ter zake van het betalen van verlaagde premies.  

### VII  

####Toepassing van de Noorse wetgeving

De toepassing van artikel 1, vierde lid, tweede alinea van de Wet van 17 juni 1966 inzake de algemene verzekering kan niet worden uitgebreid tot personen van andere nationaliteit. De toepassing van de Noorse wetgeving kan niet worden uitgebreid tot personen van andere nationaliteit op de eilanden van Spitsbergen, tenzij zij door een Noorse werkgever worden tewerkgesteld.  

### VIII  

####Toepassing van de Zweedse wetgeving

Voor wat betreft de werkloosheidsuitkeringen zegt de Zweedse regering toe dat zij er bij de erkende werkloosheidskassen op aan zal dringen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, voorzover van kracht ten aanzien van Zweden, toe te passen.  

### IX  

####Toepassing van de Zwitserse wetgeving

1. Het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling, neergelegd in artikel 8 van dit Verdrag, is niet van toepassing: 

a) op de vrijwillige ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering en op de vrijwillige invaliditeitsverzekering voor Zwitserse onderdanen in het buitenland;  

b) op de ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering en op de invaliditeitsverzekering voor Zwitserse onderdanen die voor rekening van een werkgever in Zwitserland in het buitenland werken;  

c) op de ondersteuning, toegekend aan Zwitserse invaliden die in het buitenland wonen;  

d) op de buitengewone renten van de ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering, toegekend aan Zwitserse onderdanen die voor 1 juli 1883 geboren zijn en aan hun nagelaten betrekkingen.    

2. De buitengewone renten van de invaliditeitsverzekering of de ouderdomsrenten welke daarvoor in de plaats komen, worden aan onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen toegekend, op voorwaarde dat zij gedurende vijf jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan de aanvraag om uitkeringen in Zwitserland hebben gewoond. De buitengewone renten van de ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering worden aan onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen toegekend, op voorwaarde dat zij gedurende tien jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan de aanvraag om uitkeringen in Zwitserland hebben gewoond, indien het ouderdomsrenten betreft, of op voorwaarde dat de overledene aldaar gedurende vijf jaar onmiddellijk voor de aanvraag om uitkeringen heeft gewoond, indien het betreft renten aan nagelaten betrekkingen of ouderdomsrenten welke daarvoor in de plaats komen. Het betreffende tijdvak van wonen wordt geacht door een verblijf buiten het Zwitserse grondgebied van niet meer dan drie maanden in de loop van een kalenderjaar niet te zijn onderbroken. Tijdvakken, waarin de belanghebbende wel in Zwitserland woonde, maar waarin hij was vrijgesteld van de Zwitserse invaliditeits-, ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering, worden bij de vaststelling van het vereiste tijdvak van wonen niet in aanmerking genomen.  

3. Wanneer onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen recht op uitkeringen van de Zwitserse invaliditeits-, ouderdoms- en overlevingsverzekering hebben verkregen, wordt voor de berekening van het door de Zwitserse verzekering verschuldigde rentenbedrag artikel 29, vijfde lid van dit Verdrag toegepast.  

4. Voor wat betreft het recht op de gewone invaliditeitsrente, worden onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen als verzekerden in de zin van de Zwitserse wettelijke bepalingen beschouwd indien zij, ten tijde van het ontstaan van de invaliditeit, aangesloten zijn bij de pensioen verzekering van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen of aanspraak kunnen maken op invaliditeitsuitkeringen ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

5. 

a) Onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen aanspraak maken op de revalidatievoorzieningen overeenkomstig de federale wettelijke regeling inzake invaliditeitsverzekering, zolang zij hun domicilie in Zwitserland behouden, voorzover zij gedurende tenminste een vol jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan het tijdstip waarop zij in het genot van deze voorzieningen moeten worden gesteld, premies of bijdragen aan de Zwitserse verzekering hebben betaald.  

b) Echtgenoten en weduwen die geen winstgevende arbeid verrichten, alsmede minderjarige kinderen van onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen, kunnen aanspraak maken op de revalidatievoorzieningen overeenkomstig de federale wettelijke regeling inzake invaliditeitsverzekering, zolang zij hun domicilie in Zwitserland behouden, voorzover zij gedurende tenminste een jaar, onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan het tijdstip waarop zij in het genot van deze voorzieningen moeten worden gesteld, onafgebroken in Zwitserland hebben gewoond.  

c) Minderjarige kinderen van onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen aanspraak maken op de revalidatievoorzieningen overeenkomstig de federale wettelijke regeling inzake invaliditeitsverzekering, wanneer zij hun domicilie in Zwitserland hebben en aldaar invalide geboren zijn of wanneer zij sedert hun geboorte onafgebroken in Zwitserland hebben gewoond.
