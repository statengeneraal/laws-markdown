The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its Members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating then- economic and social progress while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; Considering that the legal status of migrant workers who are nationals of Council of Europe member States should be regulated so as to ensure that as far as possible they are treated no less favourably than workers who are nationals of the receiving State in all aspects of living and working conditions; Being resolved to facilitate the social advancement of migrant workers and members of their families; Affirming that the rights and privileges which they grant to each other's nationals are conceded by virtue of the close association uniting the member States of the Council of Europe by means of its Statute, Have agreed as follows:

a. frontier workers;  

b. artists, other entertainers and sportsmen engaged for a short period and members of a liberal profession;

The recruitment of prospective migrant workers may be carried out either by named or by unnamed request and in the latter case shall be effected through the intermediary of the official authority in the State of origin if such an authority exists and, where appropriate, through the intermediary of the official authority of the receiving State.   
2.  The administrative costs of recruitment, introduction and placing, when these operations are carried out by an official authority, shall not be borne by the prospective migrant worker.   

### Article  3  

####Medical examination and vocational test

1.  Recruitment of prospective migrant workers may be preceded by a medical examination and a vocational test.   
2.  The medical examination and the vocational test are intended to establish whether the prospective migrant worker is physically and mentally fit and technically qualified for the job offered to him and to make certain that his state of health does not endanger public health.   
3.  Arrangements for the reimbursement of expenses connected with medical examination and vocational test shall be laid down when appropriate by bilateral agreements, so as to ensure that such expenses do not fall upon the prospective migrant worker.   
4.  A migrant worker to whom an individual offer of employment is made shall not be required, otherwise than on grounds of fraud, to undergo a vocational test except at the employer's request.

- the right to admission to the territory of a Contracting Party in order to take up paid employment after being authorised to do so and obtaining the necessary papers.     
2.  These rights shall be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by legislation and are necessary for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals.

The use of at least one language of the State of origin and one language of the receiving State shall be compulsory in the case of recruitment by an official authority or an officially recognised employment bureau.  

### Article  6  

####Information

1.  The Contracting Parties shall exchange and provide for prospective migrants appropriate information on their residence, conditions of and opportunities for family reunion, the nature of the job, the possibility of a new work contract being concluded after the first has lapsed, the qualifications required, working and living conditions (including the cost of living), remuneration, social security, housing, food, the transfer of savings, travel, and on deductions made from wages in respect of contributions for social protection and social security, taxes and other charges. Information may also be provided on the cultural and religious conditions in the receiving State.   
2.  In the case of recruitment through an official authority of the receiving State, such information shall be provided, before his departure, in a language which the prospective migrant worker can understand, to enable him to take a decision in full knowledge of the facts.

2.  In the case of migrant workers and their families in transit through the territory of one Contracting Party en route to the receiving State, or on their return journey to the State of origin, all steps shall be taken by the competent authorities of the transit State to expedite their journey and prevent administrative delays and difficulties.

### CHAPTER  III

####Work permit

1.  Each Contracting Party which allows a migrant worker to enter its territory to take up paid employment shall issue or renew a work permit for him (unless he is exempt from this requirement), subject to the conditions laid down in its legislation.   
2.  However, a work permit issued for the first time may not as a rule bind the worker to the same employer or the same locality for a period longer than one year.   
3.  In case of renewal of the migrant worker's work permit, this should as a general rule be for a period of at least one year, insofar as the current state and development of the employment situation permits.

The residence permit shall in accordance with the provisions of national legislation be issued and, if necessary, renewed for a period as a general rule at least as long as that of the work permit. When the work permit is valid indefinitely, the residence permit shall as a general rule be issued and, if necessary, renewed for a period of at least one year. It shall be issued and renewed free of charge or for a sum covering administrative costs only.   
3.  The provisions of this article shall also apply to members of the migrant worker's family who are authorised to join him in accordance with Article 12 of this Convention.   
4.  If a migrant worker is no longer in employment, either because he is temporarily incapable of work as a result of illness or accident or because he is involuntarily unemployed, this being duly confirmed by the competent authorities, he shall be allowed for the purpose of the application of Article 25 of this Convention to remain on the territory of the receiving State for a period which should not be less than five months. Nevertheless, no Contracting Party shall be bound, in the case provided for in the above sub-paragraph, to allow a migrant worker to remain for a period exceeding the period of payment of the unemployment allowance.   
5.  The residence permit, issued in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article, may be withdrawn: 

a. for reasons of national security, public policy or morals;  

b. if the holder refuses, after having been duly informed of the consequences of such refusal, to comply with the measures prescribed for him by an official medical authority with a view to the protection of public health;  

c. if a condition essential to its issue or validity is not fulfilled.   Each Contracting Party nevertheless undertakes to grant to migrant workers whose residence permits have been withdrawn, an effective right to appeal, in accordance with the procedure for which provision is made in its legislation, to a judicial or administrative authority.   

### Article  10  

####Reception

1.  After arrival in the receiving State, migrant workers and members of their families shall be given all appropriate information and advice as well as all necessary assistance for their settlement and adaptation.

3.  Each Contracting Party undertakes to ensure that migrant workers and members of their families can worship freely, in accordance with their faith; each Contracting Party shall facilitate such worship, within the limit of available means.   

### Article  11

1.  The status of migrant workers must not interfere with the recovery of sums due in respect of maintenance to persons in the State of origin to whom they have maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, including a maintenance obligation in respect of a child who is not legitimate.   
2.  Each Contracting Party shall take the steps necessary to ensure the recovery of sums due in respect of such maintenance, making use as far as possible of the form adopted by the Committee, of Ministers of the Council of Europe.   
3.  As far as possible, each Contracting Party shall take steps to appoint a single national or regional authority to receive and despatch applications for sums due in respect of maintenance provided for in paragraph 1 above.   
4.  This Article shall not affect existing or future bilateral or multilateral agreements.   

### Article  12  

####Family reunion

1.  The spouse of a migrant worker who is lawfully employed in the territory of a Contracting Party and the unmarried children thereof, as long as they are considered to be minors by the relevant law of the receiving State, who are dependent on the migrant worker, are authorised on conditions analogous to those which this Convention applies to the admission of migrant workers and according to the admission procedure prescribed by such law or by international agreements to join the migrant worker in the territory of a Contracting Party, provided that the latter has available for the family housing considered as normal for national workers in the region where the migrant worker is employed. Each Contracting Party may make the giving of authorisation conditional upon a waiting period which shall not exceed twelve months.   
2.  Any State may, at any time, by declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, which shall take effect one month after the date of its receipt, make the family reunion referred to in paragraph 1 above further conditional upon the migrant worker having steady resources sufficient to meet the needs of his family.   
3.  Any State may, at any time, by declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, which shall take effect one month after the date of its receipt, derogate temporarily from the obligation to give the authorisation provided for in paragraph 1 above, for one or more parts of its territory which it shall designate in its declaration, on the condition that these measures do not conflict with obligations under other international instruments. The declaration shall state the special reasons justifying the derogation with regard to receiving capacity. Any State availing itself of this possibility of derogation shall keep the Secretary General of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures which it has taken and shall ensure that these measures are published as soon as possible. It shall also inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe when such measures cease to operate and the provisions of the Convention are again being fully executed. The derogation shall not, as a general rule, affect requests for family reunion submitted to the competent authorities, before the declaration is addressed to the Secretary General, by migrant workers already established in the part of the territory concerned.

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

### Artikel  2  

####Vormen van werving

1.  De werving van toekomstige migrerende werknemers kan geschieden door middel van een op naam gestelde aanvraag dan wel door middel van een niet op naam gestelde aanvraag; in dit laatste geval dient de aanvraag te worden gericht door tussenkomst van het officiële orgaan van de Staat van oorsprong indien een zodanig orgaan bestaat en eventueel door tussenkomst van het officiële orgaan van de ontvangende Staat.   
2.  De administratiekosten verband houdende met werving, introductie en tewerkstelling, wanneer deze worden uitgevoerd door een officieel orgaan, mogen niet ten laste komen van de toekomstige migrerende werknemer.   

### Artikel  3  

####Medisch onderzoek en onderzoek naar vakbekwaamheid

1.  De werving van toekomstige migrerende werknemers kan worden voorafgegaan door een medisch onderzoek en een onderzoek naar vakbekwaamheid.   
2.  Het medisch onderzoek en het onderzoek naar vakbekwaamheid dienen om vast te stellen of de toekomstige migrerende werknemer lichamelijk en geestelijk in staat is tot en technisch gekwalificeerd voor de hem aangeboden functie en om vast te stellen, dat de gezondheidstoestand van deze werknemer geen gevaar oplevert voor de volksgezondheid.   
3.  De wijze van terugbetaling van de kosten verbonden aan het medisch onderzoek en het onderzoek naar vakbekwaamheid wordt eventueel geregeld in het kader van bilaterale overeenkomsten zodat deze kosten niet ten laste komen van de toekomstige migrerende werknemer.   
4.  De migrerende werknemer die in het bezit is van een op naam gestelde aanbieding van werk mag, behoudens een op grond van fraude gerechtvaardigde uitzondering, slechts op verzoek van de werkgever worden onderworpen aan een onderzoek inzake vakbekwaamheid.   

### Artikel  4  

####Recht om het land te verlaten - recht op toelating administratieve formaliteiten

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt de migrerende werknemer de volgende rechten: 

- het recht het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan hij onderdaan is te verlaten;  

- het recht op toelating tot het grondgebied van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen om daar arbeid in loondienst te gaan verrichten wanneer de migrerende werknemer hiertoe van tevoren toestemming heeft ontvangen en de vereiste documenten heeft verkregen.     
2.  Deze rechten worden overeengekomen onder voorbehoud van de door de wetgeving voorgeschreven beperkingen betreffende de staatsveiligheid, de openbare orde, de volksgezondheid of de goede zeden.   
3.  De documenten die de migrerende werknemer nodig heeft voor emigratie en immigratie worden zo spoedig mogelijk afgegeven, kosteloos dan wel tegen betaling van een bedrag dat niet hoger is dan de desbetreffende administratiekosten.   

### Artikel  5  

####Formaliteiten en procedure betreffende het arbeidscontract

Iedere migrerende werknemer die werk heeft gevonden, ontvangt, voor zijn vertrek naar de ontvangende Staat, een arbeidscontract of een bepaalde aanbieding van werk die kunnen worden opgesteld in een of meer in de Staat van oorsprong gangbare talen alsmede in een of meer in de ontvangende Staat gangbare talen. Het gebruik van ten minste één taal van de Staat van oorsprong en één taal van de ontvangende Staat is verplicht in geval van werving door een officieel orgaan of door een officieel erkend arbeidsbureau.  

### Artikel  6  

####Inlichtingen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen verstrekken elkaar en de aspirantemigranten passende inlichtingen over hun verblijf, de voorwaarden en mogelijkheden van gezinshereniging, de aard van het werk, de mogelijkheden om een nieuw arbeidscontract te sluiten wanneer het eerste contract is afgelopen, de vereiste vakbekwaamheid, de werken levensomstandigheden (met inbegrip van de kosten van levensonderhoud), salariëring, sociale zekerheid, huisvesting, voeding, het overmaken van spaargelden, de reis alsmede de bedragen die op het salaris worden ingehouden voor sociale voorzieningen, belastingen en andere lasten. Tevens kunnen inlichtingen worden verstrekt over de omstandigheden op cultureel en religieus gebied in de ontvangende Staat.   
2.  Bij werving door tussenkomst van een officieel orgaan van de ontvangende Staat worden deze inlichtingen aan de aspirant-emigrant medegedeeld voor diens vertrek en wel in een taal die hij kan begrijpen, zodat hij met volledige kennis van zaken een besluit kan nemen. Indien nodig wordt de vertaling van deze inlichtingen in een taal die de aspirant-emigrant kan begrijpen, in het algemeen verzorgd door de Staat van oorsprong.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich ertoe passende maatregelen te nemen om misleidende propaganda ten aanzien van emigratie en immigratie te voorkomen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Reis

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich ertoe ervoor te zorgen dat bij officiële collectieve werving de kosten van de reis naar het ontvangende land in geen geval ten laste van de migrerende werknemer komen. De regeling voor betaling van deze kosten wordt vastgesteld bij bilaterale overeenkomsten die tevens kunnen voorzien in de uitbreiding van bovengenoemde maatregelen tot de gezinnen en tot werknemers die individueel worden aangeworven.   
2.  Ten aanzien van migrerende werknemers en hun gezinnen die zich op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij bevinden op doortocht naar de ontvangende Staat of bij hun terugkeer naar de Staat van oorsprong, dienen door de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat van doortocht alle maatregelen te worden genomen om de reis te bespoedigen en om oponthoud en administratieve moeilijkheden te voorkomen.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verleent vrijstelling van invoerrechten en -heffingen bij binnenkomst in de ontvangende Staat, bij definitieve terugkeer in de Staat van oorsprong alsmede bij doortocht: 

a. voor de persoonlijke bezittingen en voor meubilair toebehorend aan de migrerende werknemers en aan de bij hen inwonende gezinsleden;  

b. in een redelijke mate, voor gereedschap en draagbare uitrusting die de migrerende werknemers nodig hebben voor de uitoefening van hun vak.   De hierboven bedoelde vrijstellingen worden verleend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de in genoemde Staten van kracht zijnde wetten of voorschriften.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

### Artikel  8  

####Werkvergunning

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die een migrerende werknemer toelaat om arbeid in loondienst te verrichten, verstrekt of verlengt voor hem (behalve bij vrijstelling) een werkvergunning op de bij haar wetgeving voorziene voorwaarden.   
2.  De werkvergunning die voor de eerste maal is verstrekt, kan de werknemer in het algemeen evenwel niet voor langer dan één jaar verbinden aan een zelfde werkgever of aan een zelfde plaats.   
3.  Bij verlenging van de werkvergunning van de migrerende werknemer dient deze vergunning in het algemeen te worden verstrekt voor de duur van ten minste één jaar voor zover de situatie op en de ontwikkeling van de arbeidsmarkt zulks toestaan.   

### Artikel  9  

####Verblijfsvergunning

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verleent, voor zover de nationale wetgeving zulks eist, een verblijfsvergunning aan migrerende werknemers die toestemming hebben gekregen om arbeid in loondienst te gaan verrichten op het grondgebied van die Partij overeenkomstig de voorwaarden voorzien in dit Verdrag.   
2.  De verblijfsvergunning wordt, op de voorwaarden voorzien door de nationale wetgeving, verleend en eventueel verlengd voor een duur die in het algemeen gelijk is aan de geldigheidsduur van de werkvergunning. Wanneer de werkvergunning van onbepaalde duur is, wordt de verblijfsvergunning verleend en eventueel verlengd voor een periode die in het algemeen ten minste één jaar bedraagt. De afgifte van het document en de verlenging daarvan geschieden kosteloos of tegen betaling van alleen de administratiekosten.   
3.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn eveneens van toepassing op de gezinsleden van de migrerende werknemer die toestemming hebben gekregen om zich bij hem te voegen overeenkomstig artikel 12 van dit Verdrag.   
4.  Indien de migrerende werknemer niet langer tewerk gesteld is, doordat hij als gevolg van ziekte of ongeval tijdelijk arbeidsongeschikt is, ofwel doordat hij onvrijwillig werkloos is en dit naar behoren is geconstateerd door de bevoegde autoriteiten, wordt hem, voor de toepassing van het bepaalde in artikel 25 van dit Verdrag, toegestaan te blijven op het grondgebied van de ontvangende Staat voor een periode die niet korter mag zijn dan 5 maanden. In het in de vorige alinea bedoelde geval is evenwel geen enkele Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht de migrerende werknemer toe te staan te blijven voor een langere periode dan die waarover de werkloosheidsuitkering wordt betaald.   
5.  De verblijfsvergunning die is afgegeven overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste tot en met het derde lid van dit artikel kan worden ingetrokken: 

a. om redenen van nationale veiligheid, openbare orde of goede zeden;  

b. indien de houder ervan weigert, na naar behoren te zijn ingelicht over de consequenties van een zodanige weigering, zich te houden aan de voorschriften die een medische autoriteit hem heeft gegeven met het oog op de bescherming van de volksgezondheid;  

c. indien aan een wezenlijke voorwaarde voor de afgifte of de geldigheid van de verblijfsvergunning niet is voldaan.   Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich er echter toe, de migrerende werknemers wier verblijfsvergunning is ingetrokken, daadwerkelijk het recht te verlenen om overeenkomstig de bij haar wetgeving voorziene procedure in beroep te gaan bij een rechterlijke of administratieve instantie.   

### Artikel  10  

####Opvang

1.  Bij aankomst in de ontvangende Staat ontvangen de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden alle passende inlichtingen en adviezen alsmede alle nodige hulp bij hun vestiging en hun aanpassing.   
2.  Hiertoe genieten de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden de hulp en bijstand van de diensten voor algemeen welzijn en openbare instellingen van de ontvangende Staat alsmede de hulp van de consulaire autoriteiten, van hun land van oorsprong. Bovendien ontvangen de migrerende werknemers op voet van gelijkheid als de nationale werknemers hulp en bijstand van de diensten voor arbeidsvoorziening. Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij streeft er evenwel naar, indien zulks nodig mocht zijn, te voorzien in gespecialiseerde sociale diensten om de opvang van de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinnen te vergemakkelijken of te coördineren.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich ertoe de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden de vrijheid te waarborgen om godsdienstoefeningen te houden in overeenstemming met hun geloof; zij vergemakkelijkt hun, binnen de grenzen van de aanwezige middelen, het houden van deze godsdienstoefeningen.   

### Artikel  11  

####Verhaal van bedragen verschuldigd uit hoofde van een onderhoudsplicht

1.  De hoedanigheid van migrerende werknemer mag geen belemmering vormen voor het verhaal van verschuldigde bedragen ten behoeve van personen die zijn achtergebleven in de Staat van oorsprong en jegens wie een onderhoudsplicht bestaat die voortvloeit uit familiebetrekkingen, verwantschap, huwelijk of aanverwantschap met inbegrip van de onderhoudsplichten jegens een onwettig kind.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn voor het verhaal van de bedragen die verschuldigd zijn uit hoofde van een onderhoudsplicht, door daartoe, voor zover mogelijk, gebruik te maken van het formulier dat is aanvaard door het Comité van Ministers van de Raad van Europa.   
3.  Voor zover mogelijk neemt iedere Verdragsluitende Partij maatregelen om een enkele nationale of regionale instantie aan te wijzen die belast zal zijn met het ontvangen en verzenden van de aanvragen om onderhoud dat verschuldigd is uit hoofde van een onderhoudsplicht die voldoet aan de voorwaarden genoemd in het eerste lid hierboven.   
4.  Dit artikel laat de bepalingen van reeds gesloten of nog te sluiten bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten onverlet.   

### Artikel  12  

####Gezinshereniging

1.  Het is de echtgenoot van de migrerende werknemer die op wettige wijze is tewerk gesteld op het grondgebied van een Verdrag sluitende Partij alsmede diens niet-gehuwde kinderen, die door de van toepassing zijnde wetgeving van de ontvangende Staat worden beschouwd als minderjarig en die te zijnen laste komen, toegestaan om op soortgelijke voorwaarden als in dit Verdrag is voorzien ten aanzien van de toelating van migrerende werknemers en volgens de procedures die voor deze toelating zijn voorzien door de wetgeving of door internationale overeenkomsten, zich te voegen bij de migrerende werknemer op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij, mits de betrokkene voor zijn gezin beschikt over huisvesting die voor de nationale werknemers in het gebied waar hij is tewerk gesteld, als normaal wordt beschouwd. Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan het verlenen van de hierboven bedoelde toestemming afhankelijk stellen van een wachttijd die niet langer mag zijn dan twaalf maanden.   
2.  Iedere Staat kan te allen tijde door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa gerichte verklaring, die één maand na ontvangst van kracht wordt, de in het eerste lid hierboven bedoelde gezinshereniging bovendien afhankelijk stellen van de voorwaarde dat de migrerende werknemer beschikt over vaste middelen van bestaan die voldoende zijn om te voorzien in de behoeften van zijn gezin.   
3.  Iedere Staat kan te allen tijde door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa gerichte verklaring, die één maand na ontvangst van kracht wordt, zich tijdelijk ontslagen achten van de verplichting de in het eerste lid hierboven bedoelde toestemming te verlenen voor een of meer in de verklaring genoemde delen van zijn grondgebied, mits deze maatregelen niet in strijd zijn met de verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit andere internationale regelingen. In de verklaring dienen de bijzondere redenen te worden vermeld die zulks rechtvaardigen met betrekking tot de opvangcapaciteit. Iedere Staat die gebruik maakt van deze mogelijkheid houdt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa volledig op de hoogte van de genomen maatregelen en zorgt ervoor dat deze maatregelen zo spoedig mogelijk worden gepubliceerd. Voorts dient deze Staat de Secretaris-Generaal op de hoogte te stellen van het tijdstip waarop deze maatregelen ophouden van kracht te zijn en de bepalingen van het Verdrag weer ten volle van toepassing worden. De verklaring heeft in het algemeen geen invloed op de verzoeken om gezinshereniging die, voordat de verklaring is gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal, bij de bevoegde autoriteiten zijn ingediend door migrerende werknemers die reeds in het desbetreffende deel van het grondgebied zijn gevestigd.   

### Artikel  13  

####Huisvesting

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kent de migrerende werknemer wat het verkrijgen van huisvesting en huurmogelijkheden betreft, een behandeling toe die niet minder gunstig is dan die zij geeft aan haar eigen onderdanen indien deze aangelegenheid valt onder haar wetten en voorschriften.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij draagt er zorg voor dat de bevoegde nationale diensten in voorkomende gevallen controles uitvoeren, in samenwerking met de betrokken consulaire autoriteiten die handelen binnen het kader van hun bevoegdheid, ten einde te verzekeren dat voor de migrerende werknemers de normen voor bewoonbaarheid op dezelfde wijze worden geëerbiedigd als voor haar eigen onderdanen.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich ertoe de migrerende werknemers, in het kader van haar wetten en voorschriften, te beschermen tegen uitbuiting bij huur.   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij draagt er, met inzet van de middelen die de bevoegde nationale diensten hiertoe ter beschikking staan, zorg voor dat de migrerende werknemer beschikt over behoorlijke huisvesting.   

### Artikel  14  

####Vooropleiding - schoolonderwijs, taalonderwijs en beroepsonderwijs - herscholing

1.  De migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden die op wettige wijze zijn binnengekomen op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij, hebben op basis van gelijkheid en op dezelfde voorwaarden als de nationale werknemers recht op algemeen onderwijs en beroepsonderwijs alsmede op een beroepsopleiding en herscholing en hebben toegang tot het hoger onderwijs overeenkomstig de bepalingen die in het algemeen gelden voor de toelating tot de verschillende instellingen in de ontvangende Staat.   
2.  Ten einde de toegang tot scholen voor algemeen onderwijs en beroepsonderwijs alsmede tot centra voor beroepsopleiding te bevorderen, vergemakkelijkt de ontvangende Staat het onderwijs in zijn taal of talen ten behoeve van de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste en het tweede lid hierboven blijft de toekenning van beurzen voorbehouden aan het oordeel van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij, die alles in het werk zal stellen om op dit gebied de kinderen van migrerende werknemers die in hun gezin in de ontvangende Staat wonen - overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 12 van deze Overeenkomst - dezelfde faciliteiten te bieden die zij ook aan haar eigen onderdanen biedt.   
4.  De eerder verworven vakbekwaamheid van de werknemer alsmede de in de Staat van oorsprong verworven diploma's en getuigschriften op vakgebied worden door de Verdragsluitende Partijen erkend op de wijze zoals vastgelegd in bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten.   
5.  De betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen zien er, in het kader van een nauwe samenwerking, op toe dat er bij de beroepsopleiding en herscholing in de zin van dit artikel zoveel mogelijk rekening wordt gehouden met de behoeften van de migrerende werknemers met het oog op de terugkeer naar hun Staat van oorsprong.   

### Artikel  15  

####Onderricht in de moedertaal van de migrerende werknemer

De betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen treden gezamenlijk op ten einde voor zover mogelijk ten behoeve van de kinderen van de migrerende werknemers speciale cursussen op te zetten voor het onderricht in de moedertaal van de migrerende werknemer met het doel onder meer hun terugkeer in de Staat van oorsprong te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  16  

####Arbeidsvoorwaarden

1.  Op het gebied van de arbeidsvoorwaarden ontvangen de migrerende werknemers die toestemming hebben om arbeid te verrichten, een behandeling die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke geldt voor de nationale werknemers krachtens de wetten of voorschriften, collectieve arbeidsovereenkomsten of gebruiken.   
2.  Bij overeenkomst mag niet worden afgeweken van het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling bedoeld in het vorige lid.   

### Artikel  17  

####Overmaking van spaargelden

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij maakt het de migrerende werknemers die zulks wensen, mogelijk om, op een door haar wetgeving vastgestelde wijze, de verdiensten of spaargelden geheel of gedeeltelijk over te maken. Deze bepaling geldt eveneens voor het overmaken van bedragen die de migrerende werknemers als onderhoud verschuldigd zijn. De overmaking van bedragen die door de migrerende werknemers als onderhoud verschuldigd zijn, mag in geen geval worden bemoeilijkt of verhinderd.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij maakt het, in het kader van bilaterale overeenkomsten of anderszins, mogelijk om de bedragen waarop de migrerende werknemers bij het verlaten van het grondgebied van de ontvangende Staat recht hebben, over te maken.

2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen stellen voorts alles in het werk om de migrerende werknemers en hun gezinsleden te verzekeren van het behoud van de in opbouw, zijnde en de verkregen rechten alsmede van het in het buitenland verlenen van uitkeringen en verstrekkingen en wel door middel van bilaterale en multilaterale overeenkomsten.

Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij oefent toezicht uit of laat toezicht uitoefenen op de arbeidsomstandigheden van de migrerende werknemers op dezelfde wijze als dit ten behoeve van de nationale werknemers geschiedt. Dit toezicht wordt uitgeoefend door de bevoegde organen of instellingen van de ontvangende Staat en door iedere andere door de ontvangende Staat gemachtigde instantie.  

### Artikel  22  

####Overlijden

Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij draagt er, in het kader van haar wetten of eventueel in het kader van bilaterale overeenkomsten, zorg voor dat maatregelen worden genomen ten einde alle nodige hulp en bijstand te verlenen voor het vervoer naar de Staat van oorsprong van het stoffelijk overschot van migrerende werknemers die zijn overleden ten gevolge van een arbeidsongeval.  

### Artikel  23  

####Inkomstenbelasting

Ten aanzien van de inkomsten en onverminderd de bepalingen betreffende de dubbele belasting vervat in de reeds gesloten of nog te sluiten overeenkomsten tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen, worden de migrerende werknemers op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij niet onderworpen aan rechten, heffingen, belastingen of bijdragen, onder welke benaming ook, die hoger of zwaarder zijn dan die worden geëist van de eigen onderdanen die zich in soortgelijke omstandigheden bevinden.

2.  Daartoe bevordert de ontvangende Staat die maatregelen die nodig zijn om de betrokken migrerende werknemer voor zover, mogelijk te revalideren of te herscholen, mits hij blijk geeft van zijn voornemen in de ontvangende Staat te blijven werken.
