##Europees Verdrag inzake het toezicht op voorwaardelijk veroordeelden of voorwaardelijk in vrijheid gestelden

####European Convention on the supervision of conditionally sentenced or conditionally released offenders

*Preamble*  The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity among its Members; Being resolved to take concerted action to combat crime; Considering that, to this end, they are in duty bound to ensure, in the territory of the other Contracting Parties, either the social rehabilitation of offenders given suspended sentences or released conditionally by their own courts, or the enforcement of the sentence when the prescribed conditions are not fulfilled,   Have agreed as follows:     
### PART  I  

####Basic principles

### Article  1  

1.  The Contracting Parties undertake to grant each other in the circumstances set out below the mutual assistance necessary for the social rehabilitation of the offenders referred to in Article 2. This assistance shall take the form of supervision designed to facilitate the good conduct and readaptation to social life of such offenders and to keep a watch on their behaviour with a view, should it become necessary, either to pronouncing sentence on them or to enforcing a sentence already pronounced.   
2.  The Contracting Parties shall, in the circumstances set out below and in accordance with the following provisions, enforce such detention order or other penalty involving deprivation of liberty as may have been passed on the offender, application of which has been suspended.   

### Article  2  

1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term “offender” shall be taken to mean any person who, in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, has: 

(a) been found guilty by a court and placed on probation without sentence having been pronounced;  

(b) been given a suspended sentence involving deprivation of liberty, or a sentence of which the enforcement has been conditionally suspended, in whole or in part, either at the time of the sentence or subsequently.     
2.  In subsequent Articles, the term “sentence” shall be deemed to include all judicial decisions taken in accordance with sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of paragraph 1 above.   

### Article  3  

The decisions referred to in Article 2 must be final and must have executive force.  

### Article  4  

The offence on which any request under Article 5 is based shall be one punishable under the legislation of both the requesting and the requested State.  

### Article  5  

1.  The State which pronounced the sentence may request the State in whose territory the offender establishes his ordinary residence: 

(a) to carry out supervision only, in accordance with Part II;  

(b) to carry out supervision and if necessary to enforce the sentence, in accordance with Parts II and III;  

(c) to assume entire responsibility for applying the sentence, in accordance with the provisions of Part IV.     
2.  The requested State shall act upon such a request, under the conditions laid down in this Convention.   
3.  If the requesting State has made one of the requests mentioned in paragraph 1 above, and the requested State deems it preferable, in any particular case, to adopt one of the other courses provided for in that paragraph, the requested State may refuse to accede to such a request, at the same time declaring its willingness to follow another course, which it shall indicate.   

### Article  6  

Supervision, enforcement or complete application of the sentence, as defined in the preceding Article, shall be carried out, at the request of the State in which sentence was pronounced, by the State in whose territory the offender establishes his ordinary residence.  

### Article  7  

1.  Supervision, enforcement or complete application shall be refused: 

(a) if the request is regarded by the requested State as likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, the fundamentals of its legal system, or other essential interests;  

(b) if the request relates to a sentence for an offence which has been judged in final instance in the requested State;  

(c) if the act for which sentence has been passed is considered by the requested State as either a political offence or an offence related to a political offence, or as a purely military offence;  

(d) if the penalty imposed can no longer be exacted, because of the lapse of time, under the legislation of either the requesting or the requested State;  

(e) if the offender has benefited under an amnesty or a pardon in either the requesting or the requested State.     
2.  Supervision, enforcement or complete application may be refused: 

(a) if the competent authorities in the requested State have decided not to take proceedings, or to drop proceedings already begun, in respect of the same act;  

(b) if the act for which sentence has been pronounced is also the subject of proceedings in the requested State;  

(c) if the sentence to which the request relates was pronounced *in absentia*;  

(d) to the extent that the requested State deems the sentence incompatible with the principles governing the application of its own penal law, in particular, if on account of his age the offender could not have been sentenced in the requested State.     
3.  In the case of fiscal offences, supervision or enforcement shall be carried out, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, only if the Contracting Parties have so decided in respect of each such offence or category of offences.

The requesting and requested State shall keep each other informed in so far as it is necessary of all circumstances likely to affect measures of supervision or enforcement in the territory of the requested State.

3. It shall inform the requesting State of all measures taken and their implementation.    

### Article  13

### Article  14  

When the period of supervision expires, the requested State shall, on application by the requesting State, transmit all necessary information to the latter.

####Europees Verdrag inzake het toezicht op voorwaardelijk veroordeelden of voorwaardelijk in vrijheid gestelden

Preambule De Staten die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Leden van de Raad van Europa, Overwegende dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn Leden; Vastbesloten tot samenwerking bij de bestrijding der misdadigheid; Overwegende dat zij met het oog daarop bij ieder in een der Lid-Staten gewezen vonnis op het grondgebied der andere Verdragsluitende Partijen behoren te zorgen voor de sociale reclassering van de voorwaardelijk veroordeelde of voorwaardelijk in vrijheid gestelde delinquenten enerzijds en voor de tenuitvoerlegging van de straf, indien aan de gestelde voorwaarden niet wordt voldaan anderzijds,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### TITEL  I  

####Beginselen

### Artikel  1  

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich elkaar overeenkomstig de hierna volgende bepalingen de wederzijdse rechtshulp te verlenen die nodig is voor de sociale reclassering van de in artikel 2 bedoelde delinquenten. Deze rechtshulp bestaat in het houden van toezicht op de delinquenten, welk toezicht enerzijds tot uitdrukking komt in maatregelen die een gedragsverbetering alsook de wederaanpassing van deze delinquenten aan het maatschappelijk leven kunnen vergemakkelijken en anderzijds door een waakzaam oog te houden op hun gedrag, ten einde, zo nodig, hetzij alsnog een vonnis over hen uit te kunnen spreken, hetzij een reeds eerder tegen hen gewezen vonnis ten uitvoer te kunnen leggen.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen leggen, overeenkomstig de hiernavolgende bepalingen, de tegen de delinquent uitgesproken vrijheidsstraf of met vrijheidsberoving gepaard gaande maatregel, waarvan de toepassing was opgeschort, ten uitvoer.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt onder een „delinquent” verstaan hij, die op het grondgebied van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen: 

(a) bij rechterlijke beslissing is veroordeeld met daaraan verbonden een voorwaardelijke opschorting van de uitspraak van het strafvonnis;  

(b) is veroordeeld tot een vrijheidsstraf die voorwaardelijk is, of waarvan de uitvoering geheel of gedeeltelijk, hetzij bij de veroordeling zelve, hetzij op een later tijdstip voorwaardelijk is opgeschort.     
2.  In de volgende artikelen wordt met „vonnis” elke gerechtelijke uitspraak bedoeld die is gedaan uit hoofde van alinea (a) en alinea (b) van het eerste lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  3  

De in artikel 2 bedoelde uitspraken moeten kracht van gewijsde hebben en voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar zijn.  

### Artikel  4  

Het delict dat aan een verzoek als bedoeld in artikel 5 ten grondslag ligt, moet zowel in de verzoekende Staat als in de aangezochte Staat strafbaar zijn gesteld.  

### Artikel  5  

1.  De Staat die het vonnis heeft uitgesproken kan aan de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de delinquent zijn vaste woonplaats heeft verzoeken: 

(a) zich uitsluitend te belasten met de uitoefening van het toezicht bedoeld in titel II;  

(b) zich te belasten met de uitoefening van het toezicht alsmede, zo nodig, met de tenuitvoerlegging van de straf overeenkomstig de titels II en III;  

(c) zich te belasten met de volledige toepassing van het vonnis overeenkomstig de bepalingen van titel IV.     
2.  De aangezochte Staat is gehouden aan dit verzoek gevolg te geven onder de bij dit Verdrag bepaalde voorwaarden.   
3.  Indien de verzoekende Staat een der in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde verzoeken heeft gedaan en indien de aangezochte Staat er de voorkeur aan geeft in een bepaald geval gebruik te maken van een der andere in het eerste lid voorziene mogelijkheden, kan de aangezochte Staat weigeren gevolg te geven aan dat verzoek, en zich tegelijkertijd bereid verklaren gevolg te geven aan een door hem aan te duiden verzoek van andere strekking.   

### Artikel  6  

Op verzoek van de Staat die het vonnis heeft uitgesproken belast de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de delinquent zijn vaste woonplaats heeft zich met het toezicht, de tenuitvoerlegging dan wel de volledige toepassing, als bedoeld in het voorgaande artikel.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  Aan een verzoek om toezicht, tenuitvoerlegging of volledige toepassing wordt geen gevolg gegeven: 

(a) indien de aangezochte Staat deze beschouwt als strijdig met zijn soevereiniteit, zijn veiligheid, de fundamentele beginselen van zijn rechtsorde, of andere wezenlijke belangen van die Staat;  

(b) indien het vonnis waarop het verzoek overeenkomstig artikel 5 betrekking heeft, is gebaseerd op feiten met betrekking waartoe reeds definitief een vonnis is uitgesproken in de aangezochte Staat;  

(c) indien de aangezochte Staat de feiten waarop het vonnis betrekking heeft, beschouwt hetzij als een politiek delict, of een met een dergelijk delict verband houdend ander strafbaar feit, hetzij als een zuiver militair delict;  

(d) indien de straf is verjaard volgens de wet hetzij van de verzoekende Slaat, hetzij van de aangezochte Staat;  

(e) indien de delinquent in de verzoekende Staat of in de aangezochte Staat amnestie of gratie is verleend.     
2.  Een verzoek om toezicht, tenuitvoerlegging of volledige toepassing kan worden geweigerd: 

(a) indien de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Staat hebben besloten ter zake van dezelfde feiten geen vervolging in te stellen of de vervolging die reeds is ingesteld te staken;

(c) indien het vonnis waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft bij verstek is uitgesproken;  

(d) naar gelang de aangezochte Staat van oordeel is dat het uitgesproken vonnis onverenigbaar is met de beginselen die aan de toepassing van zijn strafrecht ten grondslag liggen, in het bijzonder indien degene, die het delict heeft begaan vanwege zijn leeftijd niet kan worden veroordeeld in de Staat tot wie het verzoek is gericht.     
3.  Ter zake van fiscale delicten vindt toezicht of tenuitvoerlegging overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag alleen plaats, indien de Verdragsluitende Partijen ten aanzien van elk zodanig delict of elke categorie van delicten daartoe hebben besloten.   

### Artikel  8  

Voor zover nodig houden de verzoekende Staat en de aangezochte Staat elkaar op de hoogte van alle omstandigheden die van invloed kunnen zijn op de uitvoering van de maatrgelen met betrekking tot het toezicht op het grondgebied van de aangezochte Staat of de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis in die Staat.  

### Artikel  9  

De aangezochte Staat stelt onverwijld de verzoekende Staat op de hoogte van de stappen die zijn genomen naar aanleiding van diens verzoek. In geval van gehele of gedeeltelijke weigering, deelt hij de gronden voor die beslissing mede.

### Artikel  13  

Ingeval de delinquent aanleiding geeft tot intrekking van de voorwaardelijke opschorting van het vonnis als bedoeld in artikel 2, hetzij in verband met een vervolging of een veroordeling wegens een nieuw delict, hetzij wegens het niet nakomen van de hem opgelegde verplichtingen, worden door de aangezochte Staat de noodzakelijke gegevens onverwijld ambtshalve doorgegeven aan de verzoekende Staat.

### Artikel  25

Het verzoek tot het uitoefenen van toezicht gaat vergezeld van het origineel of van een authentiek afschrift van de gerechtelijke uitspraak, waarin de redenen zijn vervat die het toezicht motiveren en van de uitspraak waarin de maatregelen worden genoemd waaraan de deiinquent wordt onderworpen. Het verzoek moet het executoire karakter staven van de uitspraak en van de uit te voeren maatregel van toezicht. Voor zover mogelijk worden in het verzoek de omstandigheden beschreven waaronder het delict, dat tot de veroordeling tot ondertoezichtstelling heeft geleid, is gepleegd, alsmede de tijd en plaats aangeduid waar het is begaan, zijn wettelijke aanduiding en, zo nodig, de duur van de ten uitvoer te leggen straf. Het verzoek bevat alle gegevens over aard en duur van de toezichtmaatregelen waarvan uitvoering wordt verzocht.

Het executoriale karakter van deze beide uitspraken wordt vastgelegd in de vorm zoals is voorgeschreven door de wet van de Staat waar ze zijn gedaan. Wanneer het ten uitvoer te leggen vonnis in de plaats treedt van een ander zonder de daaraan ten grondslag liggende overwegingen te herhalen, moet een authentiek afschrift van de uitspraak waarin deze overwegingen zijn vermeld, worden bijgevoegd.   
4.  Het verzoek tot volledige toepassing van het vonnis gaat vergezeld van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel genoemde documenten.

De andere Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen op wederkerigheid aanspraak maken.
