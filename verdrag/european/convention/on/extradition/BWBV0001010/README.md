##Europees Verdrag betreffende uitlevering

####European Convention on Extradition

The Governments signatory hereto, being Members of the Council of Europe, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its Members; Considering that this purpose can be attained by the conclusion of agreements and by common action in legal matters; Considering that the acceptance of uniform rules with regard to extradition is likely to assist this work of unification, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

####Obligation to extradite

The Contracting Parties undertake to surrender to each other, subject to the provisions and conditions laid down in this Convention, all persons against whom the competent authorities of the requesting Party are proceeding for an offence or who are wanted by the said authorities for the carrying out of a sentence or detention order.  

### Article  2  

####Extraditable offences

1.  Extradition shall be granted in respect of offences punishable under the laws of the requesting Party and of the requested Party by deprivation of liberty or under a detention order for a maximum period of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. Where a conviction and prison sentence have occurred or a detention order has been made in the territory of the requesting Party, the punishment awarded must have been for a period of at least four months.   
2.  If the request for extradition includes several separate offences each of which is punishable under the laws of the requesting Party and the requested Party by deprivation of liberty or under a detention order, but of which some do not fulfil the condition with regard to the amount of punishment which may be awarded, the requested Party shall also have the right to grant extradition for the latter offences. This right shall also apply to offences which are subject only to pecuniary sanctions.   
3.  Any Contracting Party whose law does not allow extradition for certain of the offences referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may, in so far as it is concerned, exclude such offences from the application of this Convention.   
4.  Any Contracting Party which wishes to avail itself of the right provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article shall, at the time of the deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession, transmit to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe either a list of the offences for which extradition is allowed or a list of those for which it is excluded and shall at the same time indicate the legal provisions which allow or exclude extradition. The Secretary-General of the Council shall forward these lists to the other signatories.   
5.  If extradition is subsequently excluded in respect of other offences by the law of a Contracting Party, that Party shall notify the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General shall inform the other signatories. Such notification shall not take effect until three months from the date of its receipt by the Secretary-General.   
6.  Any Party which avails itself of the right provided for in paragraphs 4 or 5 of this Article may at any time apply this Convention to offences which have been excluded from it. It shall inform the Secretary-General of the Council of such changes, and the Secretary-General shall inform the other signatories.   
7.  Any Part may apply reciprocity in respect of any offences excluded from the application of the Convention under this Article,   

### Article  3  

####Political offences

1.  Extradition shall not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested Party as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence.   
2.  The same rule shall apply if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.   
3.  The taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family shall not be deemed to be a political offence for the purposes of this Convention.   
4.  This Article shall not affect any obligations which the Contracting Parties may have undertaken or may undertake under any other international convention of a multilateral character.   

### Article  4  

####Military offences

Extradition for offences under military law which are not offences under ordinary criminal law is excluded from the application of this Convention.  

### Article  5  

####Fiscal offences

1.  For offences in connection with taxes, duties, customs and exchange extradition shall take place between the Contracting Parties in accordance with the provisions of the Convention if the offence, under the law of the requested Party, corresponds to an offence of the same nature.   
2.  Extradition may not be refused on the ground that the law of the requested Party does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain a tax, duty, customs or exchange regulation of the same kind as the law of the requesting Party.   

### Article  6  

####Extradition of nationals

1. 
(a) A Contracting Party shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals.  

(b) Each Contracting Party may, by a declaration made at the time of signature or of deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession, define as far as it is concerned the term "nationals" within the meaning of this Convention.  

(c) Nationality shall be determined as at the time of the decision concerning extradition. If, however, the person claimed is first recognised as a national of the requested Party during the period between the time of the decision and the time contemplated for the surrender, the requested Party may avail itself of the provision contained in sub-paragraph (*a*) of this Article.     
2.  If the requested Party does not extradite its national, it shall at the request of the requesting Party submit the case to its competent authorities in order that proceedings may be taken if they are considered appropriate. For this purpose, the files, information and exhibits relating to the offence shall be transmitted without charge by the means provided for in Article 12, paragraph 1. The requesting Party shall be informed of the result of its request.   

### Article  7  

####Place of commission

1.  The requested Party may refuse to extradite a person claimed for an offence which is regarded by its law as having been committed in whole or in part in its territory or in a place treated as its territory.   
2.  When the offence for which extradition is requested has been committed outside the territory of the requesting Party, extradition may only be refused if the law of the requested Party does not allow prosecution for the same category of offence when committed outside the latter Party's territory or does not allow extradition for the offence concerned.   

### Article  8  

####Pending proceedings for the same offences

The requested Party may refuse to extradite the person claimed if the competent authorities of such Party are proceeding against him in respect of the offence or offences for which extradition is requested.  

### Article  9  

####Non bis in idem

1.  Extradition shall not be granted if final judgment has been passed by the competent authorities of the requested Party upon the person claimed in respect of the offence or offences for which extradition is requested. Extradition may be refused if the competent authorities of the requested Party have decided either not to institute or to terminate proceedings in respect of the same offence or offences.   
2.  The extradition of a person against whom a final judgment has been rendered in a third State, Contracting Party to the Convention, for the offence or offences in respect of which the claim was made, shall not be granted: 

a. if the afore-mentioned judgment resulted in his acquittal;  

b. if the term of imprisonment or other measure to which he was sentenced: 

i. has been completely enforced;  

ii. has been wholly, or with respect to the part not enforced, the subject of a pardon or an amnesty;    

c. if the court convicted the offender without imposing a sanction.     
3.  However, in the cases referred to in paragraph 2, extradition may be granted: 

a. if the offence in respect of which judgment has been rendered was committed against a person, an institution or any thing having public status in the requesting State;  

b. if the person on whom judgment was passed had himself a public status in the requesting State;  

c. if the offence in respect of which judgment was passed was committed completely or partly in the territory of the requesting State or in a place treated as its territory.     
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not prevent the application of wider domestic provisions relating to the effect of ne bis in idem attached to foreign criminal judgments.   

### Article  10  

####Lapse of time

Extradition shall not be granted when the person claimed has, according to the law of either the requesting or the requested Party, become immune by reason of lapse of time from prosecution or punishment.  

### Article  11  

####Capital punishment

If the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the law of the requesting Party, and if in respect of such offence the death-penalty is not provided for by the law of the requested Party or is not normally carried out, extradition may be refused unless the requesting Party gives such assurance as the requested Party considers sufficient that the death-penalty will not be carried out.  

### Article  12  

####The request and supporting documents

1.  The request shall be in writing and shall be addressed by the Ministry of Justice of the requesting Party to the Ministry of Justice of the requested Party; however, use of the diplomatic channel is not excluded. Other means of communication may be arranged by direct agreement between two or more Parties.   
2.  The request shall be supported by: 

(a) the original or an authenticated copy of the conviction and sentence or detention order immediately enforceable or of the warrant of arrest or other order having the same effect and issued in accordance with the procedure laid down in the law of the requesting Party;  

(b) a statement of the offences for which extradition is requested. The time and place of their commission, their legal descriptions and a reference to the relevant legal provisions shall be set out as accurately as possible; and  

(c) copy of the relevant enactments or, where this is not possible, a statement of the relevant law and as accurate a description as possible of the person claimed, together with any other information which will help to establish his identity and nationality.     

### Article  13  

####Supplementary information

If the information communicated by the requesting Party is found to be insufficient to allow the requested Party to make a decision in pursuance of this Convention, the latter Party shall request the necessary supplementary information and may fix a time-limit for the receipt thereof.  

### Article  14  

####Rule of speciality

1.  A person who has been extradited shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or detained with a view to the carrying out of a sentence or detention order for any offence committed prior to his surrender other than that for which he was extradited, nor shall he be for any other reason restricted in his personal freedom, except in the following cases: 

(a) When the Party which surrendered him consents. A request for consent shall be submitted, accompanied by the documents mentioned in Article 12 and a legal record of any statement made by the extradited person in respect of the offence concerned. Consent shall be given when the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to extradition in accordance with the provisions of this Convention;  

(b) when that person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the Party to which he has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of his final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it.     
2.  The requesting Party may, however, take any measures necessary to remove the person from its territory, or any measures necessary under its law, including proceedings by default, to prevent any legal effects of lapse of time.   
3.  When the description of the offence charged is altered in the course of proceedings, the extradited person shall only be proceeded against or sentenced in so far as the offence under its new description is shown by its constituent elements to be an offence which would allow extradition.   

### Article  15  

####Re-extradition to a third state

Except as provided for in Article 14, paragraaf 1 (*b*), the requesting Party shall not, without the consent of the requested Party, surrender to another Party or to a third State a person surrendered to the requesting Party and sought by the said other Party or third State in respect of offences committed before his surrender. The requested Party may request the production of the documents mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 2.  

### Article  16  

####Provisional arrest

1.  In case of urgency the competent authorities of the requesting Party may request the provisional arrest of the person sought. The competent authorities of the requested Party shall decide the matter in accordance with its law.   
2.  The request for provisional arrest shall state that one of the documents mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 2 (*a*), exists and that it is intended to send a request for extradition. It shall also state for what offence extradition will be requested and when and where such offence was committed and shall so far as possible give a description of the person sought.   
3.  A request for provisional arrest shall be sent to the competent authorities of the requested Party either through the diplomatic channel or direct by post or telegraph or through the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) or by any other means affording evidence in writing or accepted by the requested Party. The requesting authority shall be informed without delay of the result of its request.   
4.  Provisional arrest may be terminated if, within a period of 18 days after arrest, the requested Party has not received the request for extradition and the documents mentioned in Article 12. It shall not, in any event, exceed 40 days from the date of such arrest. The possibility of provisional release at any time is not excluded, but the requested Party shall take any measures which it considers necessary to prevent the escape of the person sought.   
5.  Release shall not prejudice re-arrest and extradition if a request for extradition is received subsequently.   

### Article  17  

####Conflicting requests

If extradition is requested concurrently by more than one State, either for the same offence or for different offences, the requested Party shall make its decision having regard to all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of commission of the offences, the respective dates of the request, the nationality of the person claimed and the possibility of subsequent extradition to another State.  

### Article  18  

####Surrender of the person te be extradited

1.  The requested Party shall inform the requesting Party by the means mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 1 of its decision with regard to the extradition.   
2.  Reasons shall be given for any complete or partial rejection.   
3.  If the request is agreed to, the requesting Party shall be informed of the place and date of surrender and of the length of time for which the person claimed was detained with a view to surrender.   
4.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, if the person claimed has not been taken over on the appointed date, he may be released after the expiry of 15 days and shall in any case be released after the expiry of 30 days. The requested Party may refuse to extradite him for the same offence.   
5.  If circumstances beyond its control prevent a Party from surrendering or taking over the person to be extradited, it shall notify the other Party. The two Parties shall agree a new date for surrender and the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply.   

### Article  19  

####Postponed or conditional surrender

1.  The requested Party may, after making its decision on the request for extradition, postpone the surrender of the person claimed in order that he may be proceeded against by that Party or, if he has already been convicted, in order that he may serve his sentence in the territory of that Party for an offence other than that for which extradition is requested.   
2.  The requested Party may, instead of postponing surrender, temporarily surrender the person claimed to the requesting Party in accordance with conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between the Parties.   

### Article  20  

####Handing over of property

1.  The requested Party shall, in so far as its law permits and at the request of the requesting Party, seize and hand over property: 

(a) which may be required as evidence or  

(b) which has been acquired as a result of the offence and which, at the time of the arrest, is found in the possession of the person claimed or is discovered subsequently.     
2.  The property mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be handed even if extradition, having been agreed to, cannot be carried out owing to the death or escape of the person claimed.   
3.  When the said property is liable to seizure or confiscation in the territory of the requested Party, the latter may, in connection with pending criminal proceedings, temporarily retain it or hand it over on condition that it is returned.   
4.  Any rights which the requested Party or third parties may have acquired in the said property shall be preserved. Where these rights exist, the property shall be returned without charge to the requested Party as soon as possible after the trial.   

### Article  21  

####Transit

1.  Transit through the territory of one of the Contracting Parties shall be granted on submission of a request by the means mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 1, provided that the offence concerned is not considered by the Party requested to grant transit as an offence of a political or purely military character having regard to Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention.   
2.  Transit of a national, within the meaning of Article 6, of a country requested to grant transit may be refused.   
3.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article, it shall be necessary to produce the documents mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 2.   
4.  If air transport is used, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) when it is not intended to land, the requesting Party shall notify the Party over whose territory the flight is to be made and shall certify that one of the documents mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 2 (a) exists. In the case of an unscheduled landing, such notification shall have the effect of a request for provisional arrest as provided for in Article 16, and the requesting Party shall submit a formal request for transit;  

(b) when it is intended to land, the requesting Party shall submit a formal request for transit.     
5.  A Party may, however, at the time of signature or of the deposit of its instrument of ratification of, or accession to, this Convention, declare that it will only grant transit of a person on some or all of the conditions on which it grants extradition. In that event, reciprocity may be applied.   
6.  The transit of the extradited person shall not be carried out through any territory where there is reason to believe that his life or his freedom may be threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion.   

### Article  22  

####Procedure

Except where this Convention otherwise provides, the procedure with regard to extradition and provisional arrest shall be governed solely by the law of the requested Party.  

### Article  23

### Article  24  

####Expenses

1.  Expenses incurred in the territory of the requested Party by reason of extradition shall be borne by that Party.   
2.  Expenses incurred by reason of transit through the territory of a Party requested to grant transit shall be borne by the requesting Party.   
3.  In the event of extradition from a non-metropolitan territory of the requested Party, the expenses occasioned by travel between that territory and the metropolitan territory of the requesting Party shall be borne by the latter. The same rule shall apply to expenses occasioned by travel between the non-metropolitan territory of the requested Party and its metropolitan territory.   

### Article  25  

####Definition of “detention order"

For the purposes of this Convention, the expression "detention order" means any order involving deprivation of liberty which has been made by a criminal court in addition to or instead of a prison sentence.

####Europees Verdrag betreffende uitlevering

De Regeringen die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, leden van de Raad van Europa, Overwegende dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn leden; Overwegende dat dit doel kan worden bereikt door het sluiten van overeenkomsten of door het volgen van een gemeenschappelijke gedragslijn op juridisch gebied; Overtuigd dat het aanvaarden van eenvormige regels op het gebied van uitlevering bevorderlijk is voor deze eenwording; Zijn als volgt overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

####Verplichting tot uitlevering

De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich om, overeenkomstig de regels en onder de voorwaarden in de volgende artikelen bepaald, elkander de personen uit te leveren, die door de rechterlijke autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij vervolgd worden ter zake van een strafbaar feit of gezocht worden tot tenuitvoerlegging van een straf of maatregel.  

### Artikel  2  

####Feiten die tot uitlevering kunnen leiden

1.  Tot uitlevering zullen kunnen leiden feiten die krachtens de wetten van de verzoekende Partij en van de aangezochte Partij strafbaar zijn gesteld met een vrijheidsstraf of met een maatregel welke vrijheidsbeneming medebrengt, met een maximum van ten minste een jaar of met een zwaardere straf. Wanneer er binnen het gebied van de verzoekende Partij een straf of een maatregel is opgelegd moet die straf of die maatregel ten minste de duur van vier maanden hebben.   
2.  Indien het verzoek om uitlevering betrekking heeft op verscheidene, afzonderlijke feiten die alle krachtens de wet van de verzoekende en van de aangezochte Partij strafbaar zijn gesteld met vrijheidsstraf of met een maatregel welke vrijheidsbeneming medebrengt, maar waarvan sommige niet voldoen aan de voorwaarde met betrekking tot de hoogte van de straf, is de aangezochte Partij bevoegd de uitlevering eveneens voor deze laatste feiten toe te staan. Deze bevoegdheid geldt ook met betrekking tot feiten die slechts met geldstraffen worden bedreigd.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij wier wetgeving de uitlevering voor bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde strafbare feiten niet toestaat, kan -- voor zover het haar betreft -- deze strafbare feiten van de werking van dit Verdrag uitsluiten.   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die van de mogelijkheid, voorzien in het derde lid van dit artikel, gebruik wil maken, doet bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa een lijst van de strafbare feiten waarvoor uitlevering wordt toegestaan of een lijst van de strafbare feiten waarvoor uitlevering niet wordt toegestaan, toekomen, een en ander met vermelding van de wettelijke voorschriften die uitlevering toestaan dan wel uitsluiten. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad doet deze lijsten aan de andere ondertekenende regeringen toekomen.   
5.  Indien later andere strafbare feiten door de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij van uitlevering worden uitgesloten, geeft die Partij hiervan kennis aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad, die de andere ondertekenende regeringen ter zake inlicht. Deze kennisgeving heeft eerst gevolg na afloop van een termijn van drie maanden, te rekenen van de datum van ontvangst door de Secretaris-Generaal.   
6.  Iedere Partij die van de in de beide voorgaande leden voorziene mogelijkheid gebruik heeft gemaakt, kan te allen tijde strafbare feiten die van de werking van dit Verdrag waren uitgesloten, daaraan onderwerpen. Zij brengt deze wijzigingen ter kennis van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad, die deze aan de andere ondertekenende regeringen mededeelt.   
7.  Iedere Partij kan het beginsel van wederkerigheid toepassen met betrekking tot strafbare feiten die krachtens dit artikel van de werking van dit Verdrag zijn uitgesloten.   

### Artikel  3  

####Politieke delicten

1.  Uitlevering wordt niet toegestaan, indien het strafbare feit waarvoor zij wordt verzocht, door de aangezochte Partij als een politiek delict of als een met een dergelijk delict samenhangend feit wordt beschouwd.   
2.  Hetzelfde geldt, indien de aangezochte Partij ernstige redenen heeft aan te nemen dat het verzoek tot uitlevering voor een niet-politiek delict is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te straffen op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit of politieke gezindheid, dan wel dat de positie van de betrokkene om een van deze redenen ongunstig dreigt te worden beïnvloed.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt de aanslag op het leven van een Staatshoofd of van een zijner familieleden niet als politiek delict beschouwd.   
4.  De toepassing van dit artikel tast de verplichtingen die de Partijen op zich hebben genomen of zullen nemen uit hoofde van andere internationale overeenkomsten van multilaterale aard niet aan.   

### Artikel  4  

####Militaire delicten

Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op uitlevering voor militaire delicten, die niet tevens strafbare feiten naar de gewone strafwet zijn.  

### Artikel  5  

####Fiscale delicten

1.  Inzake retributies, belastingen, douane en deviezen vindt uitlevering tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen plaats in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, indien het feit naar de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij overeenkomt met een strafbaar feit van dezelfde aard.   
2.  Uitlevering mag niet worden geweigerd op grond van het feit, dat naar de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij niet dezelfde soort retributies of belastingen worden geheven, of die wetgeving niet dezelfde soort regeling op het gebied van retributies, belastingen, douane en deviezen bevat als de wetgeving van de verzoekende Partij.   

### Artikel  6  

####Uitlevering van onderdanen

1.  

(a) Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij is bevoegd de uitlevering van haar onderdanen te weigeren.  

(b) Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan in een verklaring afgelegd bij ondertekening of bij nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding, een definitie geven van de betekenis die de uitdrukking „onderdanen" in het onderhavige Verdrag voor haar heeft.  

(c) De hoedanigheid van onderdaan wordt beoordeeld naar de toestand op het ogenblik van de beslissing over de uitlevering. Niettemin kan de aangezochte Partij zich eveneens op het bepaalde onder (*a*) beroepen, indien de hoedanigheid van onderdaan eerst is toegekend tussen het tijdstip der beslissing en de voor de overlevering voorziene datum.     
2.  Indien de aangezochte Partij haar onderdaan niet uitlevert, moet zij op verzoek van de andere Partij de zaak aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten voorleggen, opdat, indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat, een strafvervolging kan worden ingesteld. Te dien einde zullen de op het strafbare feit betrekking hebbende dossiers, inlichtingen en voorwerpen kosteloos worden toegezonden op de in het eerste lid van artikel 12 bepaalde wijze. De verzoekende Partij wordt van het gevolg dat aan haar verzoek is gegeven op de hoogte gesteld.   

### Artikel  7  

####Plaats waar het feit begaan is

1.  De aangezochte Partij kan weigeren een persoon uit te leveren voor een strafbaar feit dat volgens de wetgeving van die Partij geheel of ten dele op haar grondgebied of op een daarmede gelijkgestelde plaats is gepleegd.   
2.  Wanneer het strafbare feit dat aan het verzoek tot uitlevering ten grondslag ligt is begaan buiten het grondgebied van de verzoekende Partij, kan de uitlevering slechts geweigerd worden, indien de wet van de aangezochte Partij, hetzij vervolging van een dergelijk buiten haar grondgebied gepleegd strafbaar feit, hetzij uitlevering wegens het aan het verzoek ten grondslag liggende feit, niet toelaat.   

### Artikel  8  

####Vervolging ter zake van dezelfde feiten

Een aangezochte Partij kan weigeren een persoon wiens uitlevering is verzocht, uit te leveren, indien die persoon door haar wordt vervolgd ter zake van het feit of de feiten waarvoor uitlevering is verzocht.  

### Artikel  9  

####Non bis in idem

1.  Uitlevering wordt niet toegestaan, wanneer de persoon wiens uitlevering is verzocht, ter zake van het feit of van de feiten waarop dit verzoek was gegrond, door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij onherroepelijk is berecht. Uitlevering kan worden geweigerd, indien de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij hebben besloten ter zake van hetzelfde feit of dezelfde feiten geen vervolging in de stellen, dan wel een ingestelde vervolging te staken.   
2.  De uitlevering van een persoon tegen wie in een derde Staat die Partij is bij het Verdrag een onherroepelijk vonnis is gewezen voor het feit of voor de feiten op grond waarvan de uitlevering werd verzocht, wordt niet toegestaan: 

a. wanneer de betrokken persoon bij dit vonnis is vrijgesproken;  

b. wanneer de vrijheidsstraf of de andere opgelegde maatregel: 

i) geheel is ondergaan;  

ii) geheel, of wat het nog niet ten uitvoer gelegde gedeelte betreft, bij wege van gratie of amnestie is kwijtgescholden;    

c. wanneer de rechter de dader van het strafbare feit heeft schuldig bevonden zonder oplegging van een sanctie.     
3.  In de gevallen bedoeld in het tweede lid kan uitlevering wel worden toegestaan: 

a. indien het feit dat aanleiding heeft gegeven tot het vonnis, is gepleegd tegen een tot de overheidsdienst van de verzoekende Staat behorende persoon, instelling of zaak;  

b. indien de persoon tegen wie het vonnis is gewezen, zelf tot de overheidsdienst van de verzoekende Staat behoort;  

c. indien het feit dat aanleiding heeft gegeven tot het vonnis, geheel of gedeeltelijk is gepleegd op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat of op een plaats die met zijn grondgebied wordt gelijkgesteld.     
4.  Het bepaalde in de leden 2 en 3 vormt geen beletsel voor de toepassing van ruimere nationale bepalingen waardoor aan buitenlandse rechterlijke beslissingen *ne bis in idem* werking wordt toegekend.   

### Artikel  10  

####Verjaring

Uitlevering wordt niet toegestaan, indien volgens de wet van de verzoekende Partij of die van de aangezochte Partij het recht tot strafvervolging of de straf is verjaard.  

### Artikel  11  

####Doodstraf

Indien op het feit waarvoor uitlevering wordt verzocht, door de wet van de verzoekende Partij de doodstraf is gesteld en deze straf volgens de wet van de aangezochte Partij tegen dat feit niet wordt bedreigd of met betrekking tot dat feit door die Partij algemeen niet wordt toegepast, kan de inwilliging van het uitleveringsverzoek afhankelijk worden gesteld van de voorwaarde dat de verzoekende Partij ter beoordeling van de aangezochte Partij genoegzame waarborgen biedt dat de doodstraf niet ten uitvoer zal worden gelegd.  

### Artikel  12  

####Verzoek en stukken ter ondersteuning daarvan

1.  Het verzoek wordt schriftelijk gedaan en wordt door het Ministerie van Justitie van de verzoekende Partij gericht tot het Ministerie van Justitie van de aangezochte Partij; niettemin kan het verzoek ook langs diplomatieke weg worden gedaan. Twee of meer Partijen kunnen onderling rechtstreeks andere wegen voor het uitwisselen van stukken overeenkomen.   
2.  Tot staving van het verzoek dienen te worden overgelegd: 

(a) het origineel of een authentiek afschrift, hetzij van een voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbare veroordeling, hetzij van een bevel tot aanhouding of van een andere akte die dezelfde kracht heeft, opgemaakt in de vorm voorgeschreven door de wet van de verzoekende Partij;  

(b) een overzicht van de feiten waarvoor uitlevering wordt verzocht. De tijd en plaats, waarop de feiten begaan zijn, hun wettelijke omschrijving en de verwijzing naar de toepasselijke wetsbepalingen dienen zo nauwkeurig mogelijk te worden vermeld; en  

(c) een afschrift van de toepasselijke wetsbepalingen of, indien zulks niet mogelijk is, een verklaring aangaande het toepasselijke recht, alsmede een zo nauwkeurig mogelijk signalement van de opgeëiste persoon, en alle andere inlichtingen die van belang zijn om zijn identiteit en nationaliteit vast te stellen.     

### Artikel  13  

####Aanvullende inlichtingen

Indien de door de verzoekende Partij verstrekte inlichtingen onvoldoende blijken te zijn om de aangezochte Partij in staat te stellen overeenkomstig dit Verdrag een beslissing te nemen, doet de laatstgenoemde Partij het verzoek de noodzakelijke aanvullingen op deze inlichtingen te mogen ontvangen en kan zij een termijn stellen waarbinnen deze ontvangen moeten zijn.  

### Artikel  14  

####Specialiteitsbeginsel

1.  De uitgeleverde persoon wordt niet vervolgd, berecht of in hechtenis gesteld met het oog op de tenuitvoerlegging van een straf of maatregel, noch aan enige andere beperking van zijn persoonlijke vrijheid onderworpen, wegens enig ander voor de overlevering begaan feit dan dat hetwelk de reden tot uitlevering is geweest, behalve in de volgende gevallen: 

(a) wanneer de Partij die hem uitgeleverd heeft, erin toestemt. Daartoe moet een verzoek worden ingediend vergezeld van de in artikel 12 genoemde stukken en van een door een rechterlijk ambtenaar opgemaakt proces-verbaal, waarin de verklaringen van de uitgeleverde persoon zijn opgenomen. De toestemming wordt gegeven, indien het strafbare feit waarvoor zij verzocht wordt, op zichzelf de verplichting tot uitlevering krachtens dit Verdrag meebrengt;  

(b) wanneer de uitgeleverde persoon, hoewel hij daartoe de mogelijkheid had, niet binnen de 45 dagen die op zijn definitieve invrijheidstelling volgden, het grondgebied van de Partij aan welke hij was uitgeleverd, heeft verlaten of indien hij na dit gebied verlaten te hebben daarin is teruggekeerd.     
2.  De verzoekende Partij kan echter de maatregelen nemen die nodig zijn voor een eventuele uitzetting uit haar grondgebied of voor een stuiting van de verjaring overeenkomstig haar wet, daaronder begrepen het instellen van een verstekprocedure.   
3.  Wanneer de omschrijving van het te laste gelegde feit in de loop van de procedure wordt gewijzigd, wordt de uitgeleverde persoon slechts vervolgd of berecht voor zover de elementen van het opnieuw omschreven feit uitlevering zouden gedogen.   

### Artikel  15  

####Verderlevering aan een derde staat

Behoudens in het geval bedoeld in het eerste lid onder (*b*) van artikel 14, heeft de verzoekende Partij de toestemming van de aangezochte Partij nodig om de persoon die aan haar overgeleverd is en die gezocht wordt door een andere Partij of door een derde staat die geen Partij bij dit Verdrag is, aan die andere Partij of aan die staat uit te leveren ter zake van strafbare feiten, gepleegd voor de overlevering. De aangezochte Partij kan overlegging van de in artikel 12, tweede lid, bedoelde stukken eisen.  

### Artikel  16  

####Voorlopige aanhouding

1.  In geval van spoed kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij de voorlopige aanhouding van de gezochte persoon verzoeken; de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij beslissen overeenkomstig haar wet op dit verzoek.   
2.  Het verzoek om voorlopige aanhouding dient te vermelden dat een van de in artikel 12, tweede lid, onder (*a*) bedoelde stukken aanwezig is en kennis te geven van het voornemen een uitleveringsverzoek te zenden; het vermeldt tevens het strafbare feit waarvoor uitlevering zal worden verzocht, de tijd waarop en de plaats waar het begaan is, alsmede voor zover mogelijk, het signalement van de gezochte persoon.   
3.  Het verzoek om voorlopige aanhouding wordt aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij toegezonden, hetzij langs diplomatieke weg, hetzij rechtstreeks per post of telegram, hetzij via de Organisation internationale de Police criminelle - Interpol, hetzij op iedere andere wijze waarbij schriftelijk van het verzoek blijkt of die door de aangezochte Partij wordt toegelaten. De verzoekende autoriteit wordt onverwijld ingelicht omtrent het gevolg dat aan haar verzoek is gegeven.   
4.  De voorlopige aanhouding kan worden beëindigd, indien de aangezochte Partij niet binnen een termijn van 18 dagen na het begin van de aanhouding het uitleveringsverzoek en de in artikel 12 genoemde stukken ontvangen heeft; de voorlopige aanhouding mag in geen geval langer duren dan 40 dagen. Voorlopige invrijheistelling is evenwel op ieder ogenblik mogelijk, met dien verstande dat de aangezochte Partij daarbij alle maatregelen dient te nemen, die zij noodzakelijk acht om de vlucht van de persoon wiens aanhouding is verzocht te voorkomen.   
5.  De invrijheidstelling vormt geen beletsel voor een nieuwe aanhouding en voor uitlevering indien het uitleveringsverzoek alsnog wordt ontvangen.   

### Artikel  17  

####Samenloop van verzoeken

Indien de uitlevering van een persoon door verschillende staten wordt verzocht, hetzij voor hetzelfde feit, hetzij voor verschillende feiten, houdt de aangezochte Partij bij haar beslissing rekening met alle omstandigheden en met name met de ernst van de strafbare feiten, de plaats waar zij begaan zijn, de dagtekening van de onderscheiden verzoeken, de nationaliteit van de opgeëiste persoon en de mogelijkheid van latere uitlevering aan een andere staat.  

### Artikel  18  

####Overlevering van de uitgeleverde

1.  De aangezochte Partij brengt haar beslissing ten aanzien van de uitlevering op de in artikel 12, eerste lid, bedoelde wijze ter kennis van de verzoekende Partij.   
2.  Iedere gehele of gedeeltelijke weigering dient met redenen te zijn omkleed.   
3.  In geval van inwilliging van het verzoek dient de verzoekende Partij te worden ingelicht omtrent de plaats en de datum van overlevering, alsmede omtrent de duur van de door de opgeëiste persoon met het oog op de uitlevering ondergane vrijheidsbeneming.   
4.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het vijfde lid van dit artikel kan de opgeëiste persoon, indien hij niet op de vastgestelde datum is overgenomen, na afloop van een termijn van 15 dagen te rekenen van die datum, in vrijheid worden gesteld en hij wordt in elk geval in vrijheid gesteld na verloop van een termijn van 30 dagen; de aangezochte Partij kan weigeren om hem voor hetzelfde feit uit te leveren.   
5.  In geval de overlevering of de overneming van de uit te leveren persoon door overmacht verhinderd wordt, stelt de belanghebbende Partij de andere Partij daarvan op de hoogte; de twee Partijen komen een nieuwe datum van overlevering overeen en de bepalingen van het vierde lid van dit artikel zijn van toepassing.   

### Artikel  19  

####Uitgestelde of voorwaardelijke overlevering

1.  De aangezochte Partij kan, nadat zij een beslissing over het verzoek tot uitlevering genomen heeft, de overlevering van de opgeëiste persoon uitstellen opdat hij door haar vervolgd kan worden of, indien hij reeds veroordeeld is, op haar grondgebied een straf kan ondergaan wegens een ander feit dan dat waarvoor de uitlevering is verzocht.   
2.  In plaats van de overlevering uit te stellen kan de aangezochte Partij de opgeëiste persoon tijdelijk aan de verzoekende Partij overleveren op door de beide Partijen in onderling overleg vast te stellen voorwaarden.   

### Artikel  20  

####Overdracht van voorwerpen

1.  Op verzoek van de verzoekende Partij moet de aangezochte Partij, voor zover zulks krachtens haar wet is toegestaan, de voorwerpen in beslag nemen en overdragen: 

(a) die kunnen dienen als stukken van overtuiging, of  

(b) die afkomstig zijn van het strafbare feit en op het ogenblik van de aanhouding in het bezit van de opgeëiste persoon zijn aangetroffen, dan wel later zijn ontdekt.     
2.  De overdracht van de voorwerpen bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel vindt ook plaats wanneer niet tot een reeds toegestane uitlevering wordt overgegaan in verband met de dood of de ontvluchting van de opgeëiste persoon.   
3.  Wanneer deze voorwerpen vatbaar zijn voor inbeslagneming of verbeurdverklaring op het grondgebied van de aangezochte Partij, kan laatstgenoemde deze met het oog óp een aanhangige strafvervolging tijdelijk behouden of onder voorwaarde van teruggave overdragen.   
4.  Eventuele door de aangezochte Partij of derden op deze voorwerpen verkregen rechten blijven onverlet. Indien dergelijke rechten bestaan, dienen de voorwerpen na beëindiging van het rechtsgeding zo spoedig mogelijk en kosteloos aan de aangezochte Partij te worden teruggegeven.   

### Artikel  21  

####Doortocht

1.  De doortocht door het grondgebied van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt, na indiening van een verzoek gedaan op de in het eerste lid van artikel 12 bedoelde wijze, toegestaan op voorwaarde dat het niet gaat om een strafbaar feit dat door de Partij aan wie toestemming tot doortocht wordt verzocht, op grond van de artikelen 3 en 4 van dit Verdrag wordt beschouwd als een politiek of een zuiver militair delict.   
2.  De doortocht van een onderdaan, in de zin van artikel 6, van het land waaraan toestemming tot doortocht wordt verzocht, kan worden geweigerd.   
3.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het vierde lid van dit artikel is overlegging van de stukken bedoeld in het tweede lid van artikel 12 noodzakelijk.   
4.  In geval het vervoer door de lucht plaatsvindt zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

(a) wanneer geen landing is voorzien geeft de verzoekende Partij de Partij over wier grondgebied zal worden gevlogen daarvan kennis en verklaart zij dat een van de stukken bedoeld in artikel 12, tweede lid, onder (*a*), bestaat. In geval van een onvoorziene landing heeft deze kennisgeving de rechtskracht van een verzoek om voorlopige aanhouding als bedoeld in artikel 16 en dient de verzoekende Partij een gewoon verzoek tot doortocht in;  

(b) Wanneer een landing is voorzien dient de verzoekende Partij een gewoon verzoek tot doortocht in.     
5.  Iedere Partij kan evenwel bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging of van toetreding verklaren dat zij de doortocht van een persoon slechts zal toestaan op dezelfde voorwaarden als gelden voor uitlevering of op bepaalde van deze voorwaarden. In dat geval kan het beginsel van wederkerigheid worden toegepast.   
6.  Een uitgeleverde persoon mag niet worden geleid over een grondgebied waarop, naar mag worden aangenomen, zijn leven of zijn vrijheid bedreigd zou kunnen worden uit hoofde van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit of politieke gezindheid.   

### Artikel  22  

####Procedure

Voorzover in dit Verdrag niet anders is bepaald, is uitsluitend de wet van de aangezochte Partij van toepassing op de procedure van uitlevering en van voorlopige aanhouding.  

### Artikel  23  

####Talen

De over te leggen stukken dienen te zijn gesteld in de taal van de verzoekende Partij of in die van de aangezochte Partij. Laatstgenoemde Partij kan een vertaling eisen in de door haar te kiezen officiële taal van de Raad van Europa.  

### Artikel  24  

####Kosten

1.  De uit hoofde van de uitlevering op het grondgebied van de aangezochte Partij gemaakte kosten komen ten laste van die Partij.   
2.  De uit hoofde van de doortocht door het grondgebied van een Partij aan wie doortocht is verzocht gemaakte kosten komen ten laste van de verzoekende Partij.   
3.  In geval van uitlevering vanuit een niet tot het moederland behorend gebied van de aangezochte Partij komen de uit hoofde van het vervoer tussen dit gebied en het moederland van de verzoekende Partij gemaakte kosten ten laste van deze laatste. Hetzelfde geldt ten aanzien van de uit hoofde van het vervoer tussen de overzeese gebiedsdelen van de aangezochte Partij en het moederland van die Partij gemaakte kosten.   

### Artikel  25  

####Definitie van de term ,,maatregelen"

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag betekent de term „maatregelen" alle maatregelen die vrijheidsbeneming meebrengen en die bij vonnis van de strafrechter worden opgelegd naast of in plaats van een straf.  

### Artikel  26  

####Voorbehouden

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging of van toetreding een voorbehoud maken met betrekking tot een of meer daarbij aangegeven bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt trekt dit, zodra de omstandigheden haar dit veroorloven, in. Een voorbehoud wordt ingetrokken door een mededeling gericht tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa.   
3.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij die met betrekking tot een bepaling van dit Verdrag een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt kan de naleving van die bepaling van dit Verdrag door een andere Partij slechts verlangen voor zover zij die bepaling zelf heeft aanvaard.   

### Artikel  27  

####Territoriale toepasselijkheid

1.  Dit Verdrag is van toepassing in het moederland van de Verdragsluitende Partijen.

3.  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland kan door een verklaring gericht tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa de toepasselijkheid van dit Verdrag uitbreiden tot het „Land" Berlijn. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt de andere Partijen van deze verklaring in kennis.   
4.  Bij rechtstreekse overeenkomst tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen kan de toepasselijkheid van dit Verdrag onder bij die overeenkomst te stellen voorwaarden worden uitgebreid tot elk grondgebied van een van die Partijen hetwelk niet behoort tot het grondgebied bedoeld in de voorgaande leden, voor zover de buitenlandse betrekkingen van die gebieden door een der Partijen worden behartigd.   

### Artikel  28  

####De verhouding tussen dit Verdrag en bilaterale overeenkomsten

1.  Dit Verdrag doet wat betreft de gebieden waarop het van toepassing is, de bepalingen uit bilaterale verdragen, conventies of overeenkomsten vervallen, die de uitlevering tussen twee Verdragsluitende Partijen regelen.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen met elkaar slechts bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten sluiten, wanneer deze er toe strekken de bepalingen van dit Verdrag aan te vullen of de toepassing van de daarin vervatte beginselen te vergemakkelijken.   
3.  Wanneer de uitlevering tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen plaatsvindt op grond van een eenvormige wet, zijn die Partijen bevoegd om hun betrekkingen op dit terrein te regelen uitsluitend op basis van dat stelsel, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van dit Verdrag. Hetzelfde geldt tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, indien bij elk van die Partijen een wet geldt die het mogelijk maakt op het grondgebied van die Partij bevelen tot vrijheidsbeneming ten uitvoer te leggen, die op het grondgebied van de andere Partij of de andere Partijen zijn gegeven. De Verdragsluitende Partijen die in hun betrekkingen de toepassing van dit Verdrag van het begin af aan of nadien uitsluiten overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit lid, dienen ter zake een mededeling te richten tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa. Deze stelt de andere Partijen in kennis van elke mededeling die hij krachtens dit lid heeft ontvangen.
