##Europese Kaderovereenkomst inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten

####European Outline Convention on transfrontier co-operation between territorial communities or authorities

Preamble The member States of the Council of Europe, signatories to this Convention, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members and to promote co-operation between them; Considering that, as defined in Article 1 of the Council of Europe Statute, this aim will be pursued in particular by agreements in the administrative field; Considering that the Council of Europe shall ensure the participation of the territorial communities or authorities of Europe in the achievement of its aim; Considering the potential importance, for the pursuit of this objective, of co-operation between territorial communities or authorities at frontiers in such fields as regional, urban and rural development, environmental protection, the improvement of public facilities and services and mutual assistance in emergencies; Having regard to past experience which shows that co-operation between local and regional authorities in Europe makes it easier for them to carry out their tasks effectively and contributes in particular to the improvement and development of frontier regions; Being resolved to promote such co-operation as far as possible and to contribute in this way to the economic and social progress of frontier regions and to the spirit of fellowship which unites the peoples of Europe;   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

Each Contracting Party undertakes to facilitate and foster transfrontier co-operation between territorial communities or authorities within its jurisdiction and territorial communities or authorities within the jurisdiction of other Contracting Parties. It shall endeavour to promote the conclusion of any agreements and arrangements that may prove necessary for this purpose with due regard to the different constitutional provisions of each Party.  

### Article  2  

1.  For the purpose of this Convention, transfrontier co-operation shall mean any concerted action designed to reinforce and foster neighbourly relations between territorial communities or authorities within the jurisdiction of two or more Contracting Parties and the conclusion of any agreement and arrangement necessary for this purpose. Transfrontier co-operation shall take place in the framework of territorial communities 'or authorities' powers as defined in domestic law. The scope and nature of such powers shall not be altered by this Convention.   
2.  For the purpose of this Convention, the expression “territorial communities or authorities” shall mean communities, authorities or bodies exercising local and regional functions and regarded as such under the domestic law of each State. However, each Contracting Party may, at the time of signing this Convention or by subsequent notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, name the communities, authorities or bodies, subjects and forms to which it intends to confine the scope of the Convention or which it intends to exclude from its scope.   

### Article  3  

1.  For the purpose of this Convention the Contracting Parties shall, subject to the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 2, encourage any initiative by territorial communities and authorities inspired by the outline arrangements between territorial communities and authorities drawn up in the Council of Europe. If they judge necessary they may take into consideration the bilateral or multilateral inter-state model agreements drawn up in the Council of Europe and designed to facilitate co-operation between territorial communities and authorities. The arrangements and agreements concluded may be based on the model and outline agreements, statutes and contracts appended to this Convention, numbered 1.1 tot 1.5 and 2.1 to 2.6 with whatever changes are required by the particular situation of each Contracting Party. These model and outline agreements, statutes and contracts are intended for guidance only and have no treaty value.   
2.  If the Contracting Parties deem it necessary to conclude inter-state agreements, these may inter alia establish the context, forms and limits within which territorial communities and authorities concerned with transfrontier co-operation may act. Each agreement may also stipulate the authorities or bodies to which it applies.   
3.  The above provisions shall not prevent the Contracting Parties from having recourse, by common consent, to other forms of transfrontier co-operation. Similarly, the provisions of this Convention should not be interpreted as invalidating existing agreements on co-operation.   
4.  Agreements and arrangements shall be concluded with due regard to the jurisdiction provided for by the internal law of each Contracting Party in respect of international relations and general policy and to any rules of control or supervision to which territorial communities or authorities may be subject.   
5.  To that end, any Contracting Party may, when signing the present Convention or in a later communication to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, specify the authorities competent under its domestic law to exercise control or supervision with regard to the territorial communities and authorities concerned.   

### Article  4  

Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to resolve any legal, administrative or technical difficulties liable to hamper the development and smooth running of transfrontier co-operation and shall consult with the other Contracting Party or Parties concerned to the extent required.  

### Article  5  

The Contracting Parties shall consider the advisability of granting to territorial communities or authorities engaging in transfrontier co-operation in accordance with the provisions of this Convention the same facilities as if they were co-operating at national level.  

### Article  6  

Each Contracting Party shall supply to the fullest possible extent any information requested by another Contracting Party in order to facilitate the performance by the latter of its obligations under this Convention.  

### Article  7  

Each Contracting Party shall see to it that the territorial communities or authorities concerned are informed of the means of action to them under this Convention.  

### Article  8  

1.  The Contracting Parties shall forward to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe all relevant information concerning the agreements and arrangements provided for in Article 3.   
2.  Any proposal made by one or more Contracting Parties with a view to adding to or extending this Convention or the model agreements and arrangements shall be communicated to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The Secretary General shall then submit it to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which shall decide on the action to be taken.   

### Article  9  

1.  This Convention shall be open to signature by the member States of the Council of Europe. It shall be subject to ratification, acceptance or approval. Instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval shall be deposited with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.   
2.  The Convention shall enter into force three months after the date of the deposit of the fourth instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, provided that at least two of the States having carried out this formality possess a common frontier.   
3.  In respect of a signatory State ratifying, accepting or approving subsequently, the Convention shall come into force three months after the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval.   

### Article  10  

1.  After the entry into force of this Convention, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may decide unanimously to invite any European non-member State to accede thereto. This invitation must receive the express agreement of each of the States which have ratified the Convention.   
2.  Such accession shall be effected by depositing with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe an instrument of accession which shall take effect three months after the date of its deposit.   

### Article  11  

1.  Any Contracting Party may, in so far as it is concerned, denounce this Convention by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.   
2.  Such denunciation shall take effect six months after the date of receipt by the Secretary General of such notification.   

### Article  12  

The Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall notify the member States of the Council of Europe, and any State that has acceded to this Convention of: 

a. any signature;  

b. any deposit of an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession;  

c. any date of entry into force of this Convention in accordance with Article 9 thereof;  

d. any declaration received in pursuance of the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 2 or of paragraph 5 of Article 3;  

e. any notification received in pursuance of the provisions of Article 11 and the date on which denunciation takes effect.    

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto, have signed this Convention. DONE at Madrid, the 21st day of May 1980 in English and in French, both texts being equally authentic, in a single copy which shall be deposited in the archives of the Council of Europe. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall transmit certified copies to each member State of the Council of Europe and to any State invited to accede to this Convention.  

### APPENDIX  

####Model and Outline Agreements, Statutes and Contracts on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities

<sup> 1)  As stated in Article 3, first paragraph, second sub-paragraph, of the Convention, the model and outline agreements, statutes and contracts are intended for guidance only and have no treaty value.  </sup>   This graduated system of model agreements was devised by distinguishing between two main categories defined according to the level at which the agreement is concluded: 

- model inter-state agreements on transfrontier co-operation at local and regional level;  

- outline agreements, contracts and statutes capable of providing a basis for transfrontier co-operation between territorial authorities or communities.   As shown in the table below, only the two model inter-state agreements for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation and regional transfrontier liaison fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of States. The other inter-state agreements merely establish a legal framework for the conclusion of agreements or contracts between territorial authorities or communities, the outlines of which have been placed in the second category. 

1. MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENTS 
### *General clauses for model agreements* 

1.1. Model inter-state agreement for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation;  

1.2. Model inter-state agreement on regional transfrontier consultation;  

1.3. Model inter-state agreement on local transfrontier consultation;  

1.4. Model inter-state agreement on contractual transfrontier co-operation between local authorities;  

1.5. Model inter-state agreement on organs of transfrontier co-operation between local authorities.    

2. OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND CONTRACTS BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES 

2.1. Outline agreement on the setting up of a consultation group ibetween local authorities;  

2.2. Outline agreement on co-ordination in the management of transfrontier local public affairs;  

2.3. Outline agreement on the setting up of private law transfrontier associations;  

2.4. Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services between local authorities in frontier areas (private-law type);  

2.5. Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services between local authorities in frontier areas (public-law type);  

2.6. Outline agreement on the setting up of organs of transfrontier co-operation between local authorities.      

### 1  

####MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENTS

*Introductory Note*: The system of inter-state agreements aims above all to define precisely the context, forms and limits which States favour for territorial authority action, and to eliminate legal uncertainties likely to create problems (definition of the applicable law, judicial authorities, possible avenues of appeal, etc.). Further, the conclusion of inter-state agreements between the States concerned promoting transfrontier co-operation between local authorities would undoubtedly be advantageous in the following respects: 

- official recognition of the legitimacy of such co-operation procedures and encouragement for local authorities to use them;  

- purpose and conditions of intervention by supervisory or controlling authorities;  

- exchange of information between States;  

- links which may be established between such forms of co-operation and other procedures for concerted action in frontier areas;  

- amendment of legal rules or interpretations thereof which hinder transfrontier co-operation etc.   The system of multiple choice model agreements described above enables governments to place frontier co-operation within whatever context is best suited to their needs by using the inter-state agreement for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation (1.1) as a foundation and supplementing it with any of the various options (model agreements 1.2 to 1.5). States could have recourse either to one option only or to more or even all of them, and they could do so either simultaneously or in stages. In the case of agreements between States which already have similar legal systems, such as the Scandinavian states, recourse to agreements of such a specific kind might prove unnecessary. 

####General clauses for model agreements 1.1 to 1.5

### Article  a  

1.  For the purposes of this agreement “local authorities” shall mean authorities, communities or bodies exercising local functions under the domestic law of each State.   
2.  For the purposes of this agreement “regional authorities” shall mean authorities, communities or bodies exercising regional functions under the domestic law of each State . <sup> 1)  Paragraph 2 will not be included in draft agreements 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.  </sup>   

### Article  b  

This agreement shall not prejudice various existing forms of transfrontier co-operation between the States parties, particularly those based on an international agreement.  

### Article  c  

The Parties shall inform regional and local authorities of the scope for action afforded to them and shall help them to avail themselves thereof.  

### Article  d  

“Higher authorities” shall in the present agreement mean such supervisory authorities as shall be designated by each Party.  

### Article  e  

The extent and nature of local authorities' powers as defined in the domestic law of the States parties shall in no way be modified by this agreement.  

### Article  f  

Each State may at any time specify the areas of its territory, the objectives and forms of co-operation which are excluded from the application of this agreement. Such a specification shall not, however, prejudice rights acquired in the context of existing co-operation.  

### Article  g  

The Parties shall keep the Secretary General of the Council of Europe informed of the activities of the commissions, committees and other bodies entrusted with a task under this agreement.  

### Article  h  

The Parties may make minor changes to this agreement in the light of experience, by simple exchange of notes.  

### Article  i  

1.  Each Party shall notify the other of the completion of the procedures required under its domestic law for the implementation of this agreement, which shall take effect as from the date of the last notification.   
2.  This agreement is concluded for a period of five years from its entry into force. Unless six months' notice of termination be given prior to its expiry, it shall be tacitly renewed on the same terms of successive further periods of five years.   
3.  The Party giving notice of termination may signify that it applies only to specified articles, geographical regions or fields of activity. In such a case, the agreement shall remain in force for the remainder, unless terminated by the other Party or Parties within four months of receiving notice of partial termination.   
4.  The Parties may at any time suspend application of the present agreement for a specific period. They may similarly agree that the activity of a particular committee be suspended or discontinued.   

### 1.1  

####Model inter-state agreement for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation

*Introductory note:* This is a model inter-state agreement containing general basic provisions which could be concluded either on its own or in conjunction with one or more of the model inter-state agreements appearing below. The government of ................................................................................................................................. and ...................................................................................................................................................... aware of the advantages of transfrontier co-operation as defined in the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities, have agreed as follows: 

### Article  1  

The Parties shall undertake to seek and promote means for transfrontier co-operation at regional and local level. By transfrontier co-operation they understand all concerted administrative, technical, economic, social or cultural measures to consolidate and enhance neighbourly co-operation between the areas situated on either side of the frontier, and the conclusion of appropriate agreements for the purpose of resolving such problems as may arise in this field. These measures should seek, inter alia, to improve the conditions for regional and urban development, the protection of natural resources, mutual aid in case of a disaster or calamity and the improvement of public services.  

### Article  2  

The Parties shall endeavour, through mutual consultation, to secure to the regional authorities within their jurisdiction the resources needed to permit them to establish co-operation.  

### Article  3  

They shall also undertake to encourage local authority action aimed at establishing and developing transfrontier co-operation.  

### Article  4  

Local and regional authorities engaging in transfrontier co-operation in accordance with this agreement shall be entitled to the same facilities and protection as if they were co-operating at national level. The competent authorities of each Party shall see to it that budget provision is made for the appropriations needed to cover the running expenditure of the bodies responsible for promoting the transfrontier co-operation covered by this agreement.  

### Article  5  

Each Party shall instruct such body, commission or institution as it shall designate to study current national legislation and regulations with a view to suggesting changes in any provisions liable to hinder the development of local transfrontier co-operation. Such bodies shall give particular consideration to improving fiscal and customs regulations, foreign exchange and capital transfer rules and procedures governing intervention by higher authorities, particularly as regards supervision or control. Before taking the steps referred to in the above sub-paragraph, the Parties shall consult with each other as necessary and exchange any relevant information.  

### Article  6  

The Parties shall endeavour, by arbitration or other means, to resolve matters in dispute of local importance whose prior settlement would be necessary for the success of transfrontier co-operation projects.  

### 1.2  

####Model inter-state agreement on transfrontier regional consultation

*Introductory note:* This agreement may be concluded either individually or in conjunction with one or more of the model inter-state agreements (Texts 1.1 to 1.5). 

### Article  1  

In order to promote transfrontier consultation between the regions defined in the appendix to this text, the Parties shall establish a joint commission (hereinafter referred to as “the Commission”), and if necessary one or more regional committees (hereinafter referred to as “Committees”) to deal with matters relating to transfrontier consultation.  

### Article  2  

1.  The Commission and Committees comprise delegations whose members are chosen by each of the Parties.   
2.  Delegations to the Commission shall comprise not more than 8 members, of whom at least 3 shall represent the regional authorities. The chairman of delegations to the Committees, or their representatives, shall take part, in an advisory capacity, in the proceedings of the Commission . <sup> 1)  The figures given for the number of members of the Commission are intended for guidance only and should be adapted to individual situations, as indeed should all the provisions in this model agreement. By giving figures the authors of the model agreements intended to highlight the need for efficient commissions with relatively few members. They also wanted to give an indication of the ratio, to be maintained between representatives of central authorities on the one hand and of regional authorities on the other.  </sup>   
3.  The Committees shall be composed of ... delegations, each comprising ... members, and shall be formed at the instigation of the Commission in agreement with the regional and local authorities of the frontier areas covered by this agreement. Delegations to the Committees shall be composed of representatives of those authorities or of regional or local bodies. One delegate shall be appointed by the central authorities. He shall, where appropriate, be chosen from among the bodies representing the central authorities in the frontier areas for which the Committees are responsible.   
4.  The Commission shall meet al least once per year. The Committees shall meet as required, but at least twice per year.   
5.  The Commission and the Committees shall draw up their own rules of procedure.   

### Article  3  

Each Party shall defray the expenditure of its own delegation to the Commission. The expenditure of delegations to the Committees shall be defrayed by the authorities forming such delegations.  

### Article  4  

For purposes of co-ordination and continuity in the work of the Commission and the Committees, the Parties shall if need be establish a Secretariat whose composition, headquarters, manner of operation and financing shall be laid down in an ad hoc arrangement between them, as proposed by the Commission. Failing agreement between the Parties, the Commission itself may establish such a Secretariat.  

### Article  5  

The frontier areas covered by this agreement shall be specified in an Annex thereto, the content of which may be amended simply by an exchange of notes.  

### Article  6  

1.  The matters dealt with under transfrontier consultation shall be those arising in the following fields <sup> 1)  This list is given merely for guidance and should be adapted to each co-operation project.

Unless otherwise provided, the Commission shall be responsible for dealing with general matters and matters of principle, such as drawing up programmes for the Committees, co-ordination and contact with the central administrations concerned and with joint Commissions established before the entry into force of this agreement.   
2.  The Commission shall in particular be responsible for referring to the respective governments, as appropriate, its own and the Committees' recommendations and any projects for the conclusion of international agreements.   
3.  The Commission may avail itself of the services of experts for the investigation of particular questions.   

### Article  8  

1.  The primary function of the Committees shall be to investigate problems arising in the fields specified in Article 6 and to make proposals and recommendations accordingly. Such problems may be referred to them by the Commission, by the Parties' central, regional or local authorities and by institutions, associations or other public or private bodies. They may also take up matters on their own initiative.   
2.  The Committees may, for the purpose of studying these matters, set up working parties. They may also avail themselves of the services of experts and request legal opinions or technical reports.

### 1.3  

####Model inter-state agreement on local transfrontier consultation

*Introductory note:* This agreement may be concluded either individually or in conjunction with one or more of the model inter-state agreements (Texts 1.1. to 1.5). 

### Article  1  

With a view to ensuring a fuller exchange of information and developing consultation between local authorities on either side of frontiers, the Parties call on such authorities to make a joint study of problems of common interest through consultation committees.  

### Article  2  

The rules of procedure of such committees shall be agreed by their members. Higher authorities shall be associated with their proceedings or kept informed of them. The consultation committees shall be associated with the work of regional transfrontier consultation commissions on terms to be decided by the latter, should such commissions have been set up in the regions in question. Similarly, these commissions shall give their assistance to the work of the consultation committees. They may also act as advisory bodies in connection with the implementation of special inter-state agreements concluded in the context of transfrontier co-operation.  

### Article  3  

The function of the consultation committees shall be to organise exchanges of information and consultations on both sides as well as to study matters of common interest and determine common aims. Their activities shall be governed by respect for the responsibilities of their members and no transfer of powers shall be involved. The members of these committees may, however, within the framework of co-operation agreements, decide together what measures or restrictions are to guide their respective activities or what preliminary consultation procedures they wish to see followed.  

### Article  4  

####(alternative)

To assist these consultation committees in their work, the local authorities concerned may, within the limits of the powers conferred on them under domestic law, form associations to provide a legal framework for their co-operation. Such associations shall be set up under the civil law or commercial law applicable to associations in one of the States concerned. For the application of the legal system chosen, should the occasion arise, the conditions, formalities and particular authorisations concerning the nationality of members of the associations should be disregarded. The information provided to the higher authorities, conforming to Article 2, will include all information on the activities of the associations mentioned in the present article.  

### 1.4  

####Model inter-state agreement on contractual transfrontier co-operation between local authorities

*Introductory note:* This agreement may be concluded either individually or in conjunction with one or more of the draft inter-state agreements (Texts 1.1 to 1.5). 

### Article  1  

Transfrontier co-operation between local authorities shall be conducted inter alia by means of administrative, economic or technical contracts.  

### Article  2  

Transfrontier co-operation contracts shall be concluded by local authorities within the limits of their powers under domestic law. They shall inter alia relate to the provision of supplies or services, the taking of joint action, the creation of associations established on the basis of civil or commercial law of one of the States parties or the membership of such an association . <sup> 1)  The coherence of this agreement remains the same whether or not this paragraph is included.  </sup>  

### Article  3  

The Parties to such a contract shall specify the law applicable thereto bij reference to the law of contracts (both public and private) of one of the States parties to this argreement. They shall also specify, as far as is necessary, those derogations that may be made from such provisions of that law as are not binding. Failing any relevant stipulation in the contract, the law applicable shall be that of the State of whichever local authority is responsible thereunder for providing the principal service, or failing this, the local authority with the most important financial involvement. Under all circumstances the persons subject to the local authorities parties to the contract shall retain any right to take action against or seek remedy from the said authorities which they would have enjoyed with regard to the authorities if the latter had retained their duty to provide the said persons with the supplies or services in question. The local authorities against which such action is taken or from which remedies are sought shall be entitled to institute proceedings against those local authorities which have assumed responsibility for providing the supplies or services.  

### Article  4  

Proposals for the conclusion or amendment of contracts shall be simultaneously subject in each State to the ordinary rules governing intervention by higher authorities. However, no approval shall be required from authorities parties to the contract. Any decision taken by a higher authority which may prevent the conclusion or application, or which may provoke the cancellation, of a transfrontier co-operation contract, should imply previous consultation with the corresponding higher authorities of the other States concerned.  

### Article  5  

In the event of a dispute, the competent judicial authority shall be determined by the applicable law. However, transfrontier co-operation contracts may include arbitration clauses. Notwithstanding any such clauses users and third parties shall retain any existing legal remedies against the local authorities of the State to which they belong, it lying with those authorities to seek redress against the defaulting co-contractor. Higher authorities shall take all measures in their power tot secure the prompt execution of judicial decisions, whatever the nationality of the court from which they emanated.  

### Article  6  

Contracts concluded under this agreement shall remain in effect after its denunciation. However, the contracts will include a clause authorising the parties to terminate such contracts, subject to five years' notice, in the event of the denunciation of the present agreement. The States parties will have the power to bring about the application of this clause.  

### 1.5

### Article  2  

Within the limits of their members' powers, the associations or consortia referred to in Article 1 shall be entitled to pursue their activities arising out of their statutory purpose in the territory of each of the Parties concerned.

### Article  6  

Where, pursuant to domestic law, the association or consortium may not, on the territory of a State, exercise certain powers, rights or advantages necessary to the accomplishment of its task for the benefit of that State's member local authorities, the latter shall have the right and the duty to act for and on behalf of the association or consortium for the purpose of exercising or securing these powers, rights or advantages.

They may communicate directly with the bodies of the association or consortium and with the supervisory or controlling authorities, submit observations to them or ask to be directly consulted in specific instances and on specific matters.   
3.  The responsible authorities of the other States shall also have the right to notify the association or consortium that they object to those authorities falling under their jurisdiction continuing to take part in the association or consortium. Such notification, duly justified, shall be deemed to be grounds for exclusion and shall be specified as such in the association's articles. The authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also be entitled to be represented by a delegate to the management bodies of the association or consortium; such delegate shall be entitled to attend all the bodies' meetings and to receive their agendas and minutes.   

### Article  8  

The supplies or services with which the association or consortium is to be entrusted, in accordance with its articles, in the territory of its members shall be provided on its responsibility, thereby completely releasing its members from their obligations in respect thereof. The association or consortium shall also be responsible vis-à-vis users and third parties. The latter shall, however, retain, with regard to the local authorities for and on whose behalf the supplies or services are provided, all such rights of action and legal remedy as they would enjoy if the authorities themselves had retained the obligation to provide them with the supplies and services concerned. The authorities against whom such action or recourse is directed may themselves take action against the association.  

### Article  9  

1.  Failing conciliation, disputes between the association and .its members, or between several members, regarding its operation shall be referred to the administrative and judicial authorities of the State in which the headquarters of the association or consortium are located.   
2.  All disputes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 may be referred to the administrative and judicial authorities according to the ordinary rules applying in the territory of the States parties, unless those interested decide to refer such disputes to a tribunal which they may designate.   
3.  The States parties will take the necessary measures in order to ensure the execution on their territory of decisions and judgments, relating to the above provisions.   

### Article  10  

The associations or consortia created according to this agreement shall remain in effect after the denunciation of this agreement, though without prejudice to the provisions of Article 7, paragraph 3.

####OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, STATUTES, AND CONTRACTS BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES

*Introductory note:*  
### *Outline agreements, contracts and statutes intended for local authorities* 

Like States, local authorities could be offered a choice of agreements and contracts. In fact, such a choice already exists in a number of countries, as is shown by the appreciable volume of documentation on agreements concluded that has already been assembled. The proposed system comprises six outline agreements, contracts and statutes corresponding to different degrees and formulae of local transfrontier co-operation. According to the scope and state of national legislation, these outlines may either be put to immediate use or may be subordinated to the adoption of an inter-state agreement governing their use. In general, the conclusion of inter-state agreements, even when it does not seem absolutely essential, could help to clarify the conditions on which these agreements may be used by the local authorities. In any event, the conclusion of an inter-state agreement would seem to be a prerequisite for recourse to the agreement numbered 2.6 (transfrontier co-operation organs). This system of outline agreements intended for local authorities corresponds to the model inter-state agreements. Reference is made to the inter-state agreements in the introductory note to each outline. It is then possible to integrate the agreements and organs set up at local level, into the structures of transfrontier consultation to be set up at regional or national level. For example, the local liaison committees (outline 2.1) could be integrated into the structure of the Commissions, Committees and working parties stipulated in the model inter-state agreement on regional transfrontier consultation (1.2). Also, these models have been designed on a schematic basis, as it was not possible to take a global view of all the problems that could arise in each particular case. The outlines are a valuable guide, but may be amended according to the needs encountered by the local authorities using them. Likewise, local authorities must determine means of encouraging citizen participation in transfrontier consultation in the socio-cultural sphere. Such participation would certainly overcome the psychological obstacles sometimes seriously impeding transfrontier co-operation. Consultation, supported by public interest, would also benefit from a solid foundation. One way of encouraging public participation would be to have recourse to an association. Thus, one of the outlines (2.3) concerns the setting up of a private law association. 

### 2.1  

####Outline agreement on the setting up of a consultation group between local authorities

*Introductory note:* Normally, the creation of such a group is possible without the need for inter-state agreements. There are numerous examples of such a possibility. However, if legal or other uncertainties exist, an inter-state agreement would provide the conditions under which such consultation could be used (see model agreement 1.3). 
### *Purpose of the group and headquarters* 

### Article  1  

The local authorities Parties to this Agreement undertake to co-ordinate their efforts in the following fields within their powers (specify the field(s) of responsibility or refer to “local problems”). For this purpose, they hereby establish a Consultation Group, hereinafter referred to as “the Group”, with headquarters at .......... The Group's function shall be to ensure the exchange of information, co-ordination and consultation between its members in the fields specified in the preceding sub-paragraph. The member authorities undertake to supply it with all information necessary for the discharge of its function and to consult each other, via the Group, prior to the adoption of decisions or measures affecting the fields specified above.  

### *Membership* 

### Article  2  

Each participating local authority shall be represented in the Group by a delegation of ... members appointed by it. Each delegation may, with the Group's agreement, be accompanied by representatives of private socio-economic bodies and by experts (this alternative excludes entities other than local authorities from membership, which distinguishes this arrangement from the private law association dealt with under 2.3). Possible variant: The number of members in each delegation may vary. Membership shall be open to local and regional authorities, socio-economic groups and private persons subscribing to this agreement. The Group shall decide on the admission of new members. Each delegation may, with the Group's agreement, be accompanied by representatives of private bodies and by experts.  

### *Terms of reference* 

### Article  3  

The Group may deliberate on all matters specified in Article 1. All questions on which a consensus is reached, and recommendations which the Group decides to make to the relevant authorities or groups, shall be recorded in the minutes. The Group shall be authorised to commission studies and investigations on matters within its competence.  

### Article  4  

The members of the Group may agree to entrust the Group with the execution of certain well-defined practical duties. The Group may also carry out any tasks entrusted to it by other agencies.  

### *Operation* 

### Article  5  

The Group shall draw up its own rules of procedure.  

### Article  6  

The Group shall, as a general rule, be convened twice a year, or at the request of one-third of its members proposing the entry of an item on its agenda. Notice of the meeting must be given and the agenda circulated at least 15 days in advance, in order that the deliberations may be prepared by each of the institutions represented.  

### Article  7  

The Group shall appoint from among its members a permanent Bureau whose membership and powers it shall determine. The Chair shall be taken in accordance with the rules of procedure or, where they do not apply, by the oldest member present.  

### *Relations with outside persons and higher authorities* 

### Article  8  

In relations with outside persons, the Group shall be represented by its Chairman, except as otherwise provided for in the rules of procedure. Higher authorities, to which members of the Group belong, may obtain from the Group such information as they may request on the Group's work and shall be authorised to send an observer to its meetings.  

### *Secretariat and finance* 

### Article  9  

Secretarial services shall be provided by one of the member institutions (with or without a system of annual replacement). Each authority shall be required to contribute to the cost of secretarial services as specified hereunder:... Information and documentation shall normally be circulated in the language of the State from which it originates.  

### *Accession and withdrawal* 

### Article  10  

Membership of the Group shall be open to such additional local and regional authorities as may subscribe to this agreement. The Group shall decide on the admission of new members.  

### Article  11  

Any member may withdraw from the Group by notifying the Chairman to that effect. The withdrawal of a member from the Group shall not affect its operation unless otherwise decided upon by the Group.  

### Article  12  

The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of the conclusion of this agreement and supply him with the text.  

### 2.2  

####Outline agreement on co-ordination in the management of transfrontier local public affairs

*Introductory note:* In several States this type of transfrontier co-operation agreement is already possible. Where this is not the case, the conditions under which such an agreement could be used should be defined within the framework of an inter-state agreement (see model agreement 1.3). 
### *Purpose of the agreement* 

### Article  1  

Article 1 specifies the purpose of the agreement (e.g. harmonious development of frontier regions) and the fields concerned.  

### *Territory covered by the agreement* 

### Article  2  

Article 2 should specify the territories covered by the agreement on either side (or on all three sides) of the frontier.  

### *Undertakings* 

### Article  3  

Article 3 should define the means of achieving the aims of the agreement (Article 1). According to the material purpose of the agreement, the following undertakings may be specified: 

- the Parties undertake to comply with a prior consultation procedure before reaching decisions on a number of measures they have to take within the limits of their powers and of the territory administered by them;  

- the Parties undertake, within their territory and within the limits of their powers, to take the measures necessary to the achievement of the agreement's objectives;  

- the Parties undertake to do nothing detrimental to the objectives of this agreement.    

### *Co-ordination* 

### Article  4  

Article 4 should specify, in accordance with the particular circumstances and requirements of each agreement, the arrangements for co-ordination: 

- either by designating for co-ordination purposes the general purpose group referred to in Outline Agreement 2.1;  

- or by providing for the establishment of a specific consultation group for the purpose of this agreement;  

- or simply by means of direct bilateral contracts between the authorities concerned.    

### *Conciliation* 

### Article  5  

Each member of the Group (each Party, if there is no Group) may raise with the Group (the other Party, if there is no Group) any case in which it considers that the agreement has not been observed in that: 

- either there has been no prior consultation;  

- or the measures taken are not in keeping with the agreement;  

- or the measures necessary to the achievement of the aims of the agreement have not been taken.   If the Parties fail to reach agreement, the dispute may be referred to a Conciliation Board entrusted with ensuring compliance with the undertakings entered into.  

### *Controlling Body* 

### Article  6  

The Parties may agree to set up a specific Controlling Body to ensure compliance with the undertakings entered into, composed of an equal number of experts appointed by each Party and a neutral expert whose appointment or the mode of such appointment shall be provided for in advance. The Controlling Body shall give an opinion, which it shall have the authority to make public, as to whether the agreement has been observed.  

### Article  7  

The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the conclusion of this agreement and supply him with the text.  

### 2.3  

####Outline agreement on the setting up of private law transfrontier associations

*Introductory note:* It is assumed that the local authority of one State may belong to a private law association of another State in accordance with the same rules and conditions as apply to that local authority's membership of a private law association in its own State. If such is not the case at present, the possibility should be expressly provided for by means of an inter-state agreement between the States concerned (see inter-state model agreements 1.3 and 1.4). Private associations are normally required to comply with rules laid down in the law of the country where they have their headquarters. The following list shows the provisions which should be included in their Articles, where this is not specified by law. The provisions governing consultation groups (see outline agreement 2.1) may also apply, mutatis mutandis, to associations of this type. The association's Articles should specify: 

1. its founder members and the conditions for the admission of new members;  

2. its name, headquarters and legal form (with reference to the relevant national legislation);  

3. its object, the manner of achieving this object and the resources at the association's disposal;  

4. its bodies and in particular the functions and mode of operation of its General Assembly (representation and voting);  

5. appointment of administrators or executive officers and their powers;  

6. the extent of members' liabilities vis-à-vis third parties;  

7. conditions for modification of the Articles and for winding-up the association;  

8. an undertaking by the Parties to inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of the formation of a transfrontier association and to supply him with its Articles.    

### 2.4  

####Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services between local authorities in frontier areas (“private-law” type)

*Introductory note:* It is assumed that local authorities have the right to conclude such a contract with local authorities of other countries. Where this is not the case, this possibility should be expressly provided for within the framework of an inter-state agreement (see model agreement 1.4). This is a type of contract which may be used by local authorities for sales, leases, works contracts, the supply of goods or services, the granting of operating concessions, etc. Local authorities' use of “private-law” contracts is permitted to varying degrees in national legislation and practice and it is difficult to draw the line between “public-law” and “private-law” contracts. Nevertheless it may be assumed that this type of contract may be used wherever, according to the prevailing interpretation in each particular country, the agreement concerns an operation of a commercial or economic type for-which a private person or corporate body could also have contracted. In the case of operations which involve action by local authorities in the exercise of functions reserved to public authority, the supplementary rules specified in the “public-law” outline contract (see 2.5) must be borne in mind, in addition to the provisions set out below. 
### *Parties* 

*Article 1* specifies the Parties (and whether the agreement is open tot other local authorities). *Article 2* specifies the problems connected with general contractual powers and, in particular, beneficiaries and terms and conditions. It may also, where appropriate, specify the necessary reservations regarding authorisation by higher authorities, where this affects the applicability of the contract. 
### *Object of the contract* 

*Article 3* specifies the object of the contract by reference to: 

- specific matters;  

- geographical areas;  

- corporate bodies (municipalities, national bodies with local powers, etc.);  

- specific legal forms.   *Article 4* specifies the duration of the contract, the conditions for renewal and any completion dates. 
### *Legal regime and financial provisions* 

*Article 5* indicates the place of signature and performance of the contract and specifies the legal regime by which it is governed (private international law) and the law which applies. *Article 6* deals, where appropriate, with financial questions (currency in which payment is to be made and the mode of price adjustment in the case of long-term services) and insurance. 
### *Arbitration* 

*Article 7* provides, if necessary, for a conciliation procedure and provides for an arbitration procedure. In the event of arbitration, the arbitration board shall be made up as follows: 

- each Party with opposing interests (Variant: the presidents of the administrative courts with jurisdiction over each of the parties) shall designate a member of the arbitration board and the Parties shall jointly appoint one or two independent members so that there may be an odd number of members;  

- where there is an even number of members of the arbitration board and the votes are tied, the independent member shall have a casting vote.   
### *Alteration and termination of the contract* 

*Article 8* specifies the rules to apply in the event of alteration or termination of the contract. *Article 9* The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of the conclusion of this agreement and supply him with the text.  

### 2.5  

####Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services between local authorities in frontier areas (“public-law” type)

*Introductory note:* This type of contract is similar to that dealt with under 2.4 (“private-law” contracts) in that it relates to specific purposes. This type is more particularly concerned with concessions or contracts for public services or public works (or services or works which are regarded as “public” by one of the countries concerned), or the provision of contributory finance from one authority to another on the other side of the frontier. Such public concessions entail special risks and responsibilities related to the public services provided which require the inclusion in the contract of other provisions in addition to those specified in the model “private-law” contract. <sup> 1)  This arrangement might be particularly useful to frontier authorities, e.g. in the case of pollution: one authority might offer another contributory finance to enable it to carry out work within its competence but of value to the first.  </sup> “Transfrontier” contracts of this type are not necessarily permitted in all countries. Consequently, the possibility of such arrangements and the conditions for their use would often first have to be provided for in an inter-state agreement (see model agreement 1.4). The use of such a contract, which is simple enough to devise and implement, could in some cases obviate the need for a joint agency of the “Transfrontier Syndicate of Local Auhtorities” type (see 2.6), which raises other legal problems. 
### *Contractual provisions* 

Where the contract involves the establishment or administration of public property, a public service or facility belonging to a local authority in at least one of the countries, contractual guarantees must be specified in accordance with the rules which apply in the country or countries concerned. The contract will also, where necessary, make reference to the following specific conditions: 

1. the regulations governing the establishment or operation of the facility or service concerned (e.g. timetable, charges, conditions of use, etc.);  

2. special conditions governing the setting up of the facility or service (e.g. permits required, procedure, etc.);  

3. the conditions of contract for the facility or service;  

4. the procedure for adjusting the contract for reasons of public interest and resulting financial compensation;  

5. ensuing relations between users of the facility or service and the operator (e.g. conditions of access, charges, etc.);  

6. withdrawal from, surrender or termination of the contract.   In addition to the special requirements, the provisions specified in the specimen “private-law” contract 2.4 will also apply.  

### 2.6  

####Outline agreement on the setting up of organs of transfrontier co-operation between local authorities

*Introductory note:* It is assumed that several local authorities may get together and form a legally based organisation with a view to providing and operating some public utility, service or facility body. The creation and functioning of such an association or syndicate will mainly depend on the applicable legislation and the provisions of any previous inter-state agreement authorising this form of co-operation (see model agreement 1.5). There follows a list of the provisions that the articles of association should include, insofar as they are not embodied in the applicable legislation. The articles of association should specify inter alia: 

1. the names of the founding members of the association and the conditions on which new members may join;  

2. the name, headquarters, duration and legal status of the association (with references to the law conferring legal status upon it);  

3. the object of the association, the way in which it is to be pursued and the resources at the association's disposal;  

4. the way in which the registered capital is constituted;  

5. the scope and limits of members' liabilities;  

6. the procedure for appointing and dismissing administrators or managers of the association, as well as their powers;  

7. the associations' relations with its members, third parties and higher authorities, especially as regards the communication of budgets, balance sheets and accounts;  

8. the people with responsibility for financial and technical control over the activity of the association and the reports arising out of such control;  

9. the conditions for altering the articles of association and for the dissolution of the association;  

10. the rules applying to personnel;  

11. the rules applying to languages.    

####Europese Kaderovereenkomst inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten

Preambule De Lid-Staten van de Raad van Europa die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Overwegende dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is het tot stand brengen van een grotere eenheid tussen zijn leden en het bevorderen van samenwerking tussen hen; Overwegende dat, zoals omschreven in artikel 1 van het Statuut van de Raad van Europa, dit doel inzonderheid zal worden nagestreefd door het sluiten van overeenkomsten op het bestuurlijk vlak; Overwegende dat de Raad van Europa erop dient toe te zien dat de territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten in Europa deelnemen aan de verwezenlijking van zijn doel; In aanmerking nemende het belang voor het nastreven van dit doel, van samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten in grensgebieden op terreinen zoals regionale ontwikkeling en stads- en plattelandsontwikkeling, milieubescherming, verbetering van openbare voorzieningen en diensten en wederzijdse bijstand bij rampen; Gelet op de in het verleden opgedane ervaring, waaruit blijkt dat samenwerking tussen lokale en regionale autoriteiten in Europa het voor deze gemakkelijker maakt hun taken doeltreffend te verrichten en inzonderheid bijdraagt tot de ontsluiting en ontwikkeling van grensgebieden; Vastbesloten een zodanige samenwerking zoveel mogelijk te bevorderen en op deze wijze bij te dragen tot de economische en sociale vooruitgang van grensgebieden en tot de solidariteit die de volken van Europa verenigt.   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  1  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verbindt zich ertoe grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten binnen haar rechtsmacht en territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten binnen de rechtsmacht van andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te vergemakkelijken en te bevorderen. Zij tracht te bevorderen dat de overeenkomsten en regelingen, die hiertoe noodzakelijk blijken te zijn, tot stand worden gebracht, met inachtneming van de voor elke Partij geldende constitutionele bepalingen.  

### Artikel  2  

1.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder grensoverschrijdende samenwerking verstaan elk onderling afgestemd optreden met het oogmerk het nabuurschap tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten binnen de rechtsmacht van twee of meer Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen te versterken en te bevorderen en de voor dit doel noodzakelijke overeenkomsten en regelingen tot stand te brengen. De grensoverschrijdende samenwerking vindt plaats in het kader van de bevoegdheden van de territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten zoals omschreven in het interne recht. De reikwijdte en aard van zodanige bevoegdheden worden niet door deze Overeenkomst gewijzigd.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder de uitdrukking „territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten” verstaan gemeenschappen, autoriteiten of lichamen, die lokale en regionale functies vervullen en die als zodanig worden beschouwd in het interne recht van elke Staat. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan evenwel, op het tijdstip van ondertekening van deze Overeenkomst of in een latere mededeling aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, de gemeenschappen, autoriteiten of lichamen, alsmede de onderwerpen en vormen aangeven waartoe zij de reikwijdte van deze Overeenkomst wenst te beperken of die zij van de reikwijdte van deze Overeenkomst wenst uit te sluiten.   

### Artikel  3  

1.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst bevorderen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 2, tweede lid, elk initiatief van territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de kaderregelingen tussen territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten opgesteld binnen de Raad van Europa. Indien zij zulks noodzakelijk achten, kunnen zij rekening houden met de bilaterale of multilaterale modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten, opgesteld binnen de Raad van Europa met het oogmerk de samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten te vergemakkelijken. De tot stand te brengen regelingen en overeenkomsten kunnen worden gebaseerd op de model- en kaderovereenkomsten, kaderstatuten en kadercontracten die aan deze Overeenkomst zijn gehecht onder de nummers 1.1 tot en met 1.5 en 2.1 tot en met 2.6 met de nodige wijzigingen in verband met de bijzondere situatie van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Deze model- en kaderovereenkomsten, kaderstatuten en kadercontracten zijn slechts als richtsnoer bedoeld en hebben niet de kracht van een overeenkomst.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen het noodzakelijk achten, overeenkomsten tussen Staten te sluiten, kunnen daarin onder meer de context, vormen en grenzen worden vastgelegd voor het optreden van de territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten die zijn betrokken bij grensoverschrijdende samenwerking. Elke overeenkomst kan tevens de autoriteiten of lichamen aangeven, waarop zij van toepassing is.   
3.  De bovenstaande bepalingen beletten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen niet, in onderlinge overeenstemming gebruik te maken van andere vormen van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking. Evenmin dienen de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst zo te worden uitgelegd als zouden zij bestaande samenwerkingsovereenkomsten ongeldig maken.   
4.  De overeenkomsten en regelingen dienen tot stand te worden gebracht met inachtneming van de door het interne recht van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vastgestelde bevoegdheid ten aanzien van internationale betrekkingen en algemeen beleid en met inachtneming van de voorschriften inzake controle of toezicht waaraan territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten onderworpen zijn.   
5.  Hiertoe kan iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, op het tijdstip van ondertekening van deze Overeenkomst of in een latere mededeling aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, de autoriteiten aangeven die ingevolge haar interne recht bevoegd zijn controle of toezicht uit te oefenen ten aanzien van de betrokken territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten.   

### Artikel  4  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tracht de juridische, bestuurlijke of technische moeilijkheden die de ontwikkeling en het goede verloop van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking kunnen belemmeren, op te lossen en pleegt voor zover nodig overleg met de andere betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of Partijen.  

### Artikel  5  

In geval van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, overwegen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de wenselijkheid van toekenning aan de daaraan deelnemende territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten van dezelfde faciliteiten als wanneer deze op nationaal niveau zouden samenwerken.  

### Artikel  6  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verstrekt in zo ruim mogelijke mate alle informatie waarom een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verzoekt ten einde het nakomen door deze laatste Partij van haar verplichtingen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  7  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij draagt er zorg voor dat de betrokken territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten in kennis worden gesteld van de middelen tot handelen waarvan zij ingevolge deze Overeenkomst gebruik kunnen maken.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zenden de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa alle ter zake dienende informatie toe betreffende de overeenkomsten en regelingen bedoeld in artikel 3.   
2.  Elk voorstel van een of meer Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor aanvulling of uitbreiding van deze Overeenkomst of van de modelovereenkomsten en -regelingen dient te worden medegedeeld aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa. De Secretaris-Generaal legt dit voor aan het Comité van Ministers van de Raad van Europa, dat besluit welk gevolg eraan gegeven dient te worden.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Deze Overeenkomst staat open voor ondertekening door de Lid-Staten van de Raad van Europa. Zij dient te worden bekrachtigd, aanvaard of goedgekeurd. De akten van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa.   
2.  De Overeenkomst treedt in werking drie maanden na de datum van nederlegging van de vierde akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring, mits ten minste twee van de Staten die deze formaliteit hebben verricht een gemeenschappelijke grens hebben.   
3.  Ten aanzien van iedere ondertekenende Staat die de Overeenkomst daarna bekrachtigt, aanvaardt of goedkeurt, treedt de Overeenkomst in werking drie maanden na de datum van nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  Na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst kan het Comité van Ministers van de Raad van Europa met eenparigheid van stemmen besluiten iedere Europese Staat die geen lid is van de Raad, uit te nodigen tot deze Overeenkomst toe te treden. Deze uitnodiging dient de uitdrukkelijke instemming te verkrijgen van elke Staat die de Overeenkomst heeft bekrachtigd.   
2.  Toetreding geschiedt door nederlegging bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa van een akte van toetreding, die drie maanden na de datum van nederlegging van kracht wordt.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  Iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan, voor zover haarzelf betreft, deze Overeenkomst opzeggen door een daartoe strekkende kennisgeving te richten aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa.   
2.  De opzegging wordt van kracht zes maanden na de datum van ontvangst van een zodanige kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal.   

### Artikel  12

### AANHANGSEL  

####Model- en kaderovereenkomsten, kaderstatuten en kadercontracten inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten

<sup> 1)  Zoals vermeld in artikel 3, eerste lid, tweede alinea, van de Overeenkomst zijn de model- en kaderovereenkomsten, kaderstatuten en kadercontracten slechts als richtsnoer bedoeld en hebben zij niet de kracht van een overeenkomst.  </sup>   In dit graduele systeem van modelovereenkomsten is onderscheid gemaakt tussen twee hoofdcategorieën omschreven volgens het niveau waarop de overeenkomst wordt gesloten: 

- modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking op lokaal en regionaal niveau;  

- kaderovereenkomsten, -contracten en -statuten die een grondslag kunnen vormen voor grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen en autoriteiten.   Zoals aangegeven in de onderstaande tabel, vallen slechts de twee modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten inzake de bevordering van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking en inzake regionaal grensoverschrijdend overleg uitsluitend binnen de rechtsmacht van Staten. De andere overeenkomsten tussen Staten scheppen slechts een juridisch kader voor het sluiten van overeenkomsten of contracten tussen territoriale autoriteiten of gemeenschappen; de kaderteksten van zodanige overeenkomsten of contracten zijn ondergebracht in de tweede categorie.

####MODELOVEREENKOMSTEN TUSSEN STATEN

*Inleidende opmerking:* het stelsel van overeenkomsten tussen Staten heeft met name ten doel de nauwkeurige omschrijving van de context, vormen en grenzen die de Staten wenselijk achten voor het optreden van territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten, alsmede het wegnemen van juridische onzekerheden die problemen zouden kunnen scheppen (aanwijzing van het toepasselijke recht, rechterlijke bevoegdheid, beroepsmogelijkheden, enz.). Voorts zal het sluiten van zodanige overeenkomsten tussen de betrokken Staten ter bevordering van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen lokale autoriteiten ongetwijfeld van nut zijn in de volgende opzichten: 

- officiële erkenning van de rechtmatigheid van zodanige samenwerkingsprocedures en aanmoediging van lokale autoriteiten daarvan gebruik te maken;  

- doel van en voorwaarden voor ingrijpen door toezichthoudende of controlerende autoriteiten;  

- uitwisseling van informatie tussen Staten;  

- banden die tot stand kunnen worden gebracht tussen die vormen van samenwerking en andere procedures voor onderling afgestemd optreden in grensgebieden;  

- wijziging van wettelijke regels of van de interpretatie daarvan die de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking belemmeren, enz.   Het hierboven beschreven systeem van modelovereenkomsten waaruit een keuze kan worden gemaakt, stelt de regeringen in staat de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking te plaatsen in de samenhang die het best aansluit bij hun behoeften, door de overeenkomst tussen Staten inzake de bevordering van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking (1.1) als basis te nemen en deze aan te vullen met een van de diverse andere overeenkomsten (modelovereenkomsten 1.2 tot en met 1.5). De Staten kunnen een van deze modellen kiezen, of meer en zelfs alle modellen, en zij kunnen dat op hetzelfde tijdstip doen of een meer gefaseerde aanpak volgen. In het geval van overeenkomsten tussen Staten die reeds gelijksoortige rechtsstelsels hebben, zoals de Scandinavische Staten, kan gebruikmaking van overeenkomsten van een zo specifiek soort overbodig blijken. 

####Algemene clausules voor de model-overeenkomsten 1.1 tot en met 1.5

### Artikel  a  

1.  Voor de toepassing van deze overeenkomst wordt onder „lokale autoriteiten” verstaan, autoriteiten, gemeenschappen of lichamen die lokale functies vervullen ingevolge de binnenlandse wetgeving van elke Staat.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van deze overeenkomst wordt onder „regionale autoriteiten” verstaan, autoriteiten, gemeenschappen of lichamen die regionale functies vervullen ingevolge de binnenlandse wetgeving van elke Staat. <sup> 1)  Het tweede lid wordt niet opgenomen in de ontwerpovereenkomsten 1.3, 1.4 en 1.5.  </sup>   

### Artikel  b  

Deze overeenkomst laat de verschillende bestaande vormen van grenoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen de Staten die partij zijn, met name die vormen welke zijn gebaseerd op een internationale overeenkomst, onverlet.  

### Artikel  c  

De Partijen stellen de regionale en lokale autoriteiten in kennis van de aan deze geboden middelen tot optreden en moedigen deze aan, daarvan gebruik te maken.  

### Artikel  d  

In deze overeenkomst worden onder „hogere autoriteiten” verstaan de toezichthoudende en controlerende autoriteiten die door elke Partij zijn aangewezen.  

### Artikel  e  

De reikwijdte en de aard van de bevoegdheden van de lokale autoriteiten zoals omschreven in het interne recht van de Staten die partij zijn, worden in generlei opzicht door deze overeenkomst gewijzigd.  

### Artikel  f  

Elke Staat kan te allen tijde de delen van zijn grondgebied en de doelstellingen en vormen van samenwerking aanwijzen, die van toepassing van deze overeenkomst zijn uitgesloten. Een zodanige aanwijzing laat de in het verband van bestaande samenwerking verworven rechten evenwel onverlet.  

### Artikel  g  

De Partijen houden de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa op de hoogte van de activiteiten van de commissies, comité's en andere lichamen aan wie ingevolge deze overeenkomst taken zijn toevertrouwd.  

### Artikel  h  

De Partijen kunnen door middel van een eenvoudige notawisseling ondergeschikte veranderingen in deze overeenkomst aanbrengen die, gezien de opgedane ervaring, wenselijk zijn gebleken.  

### Artikel  i  

1.  Elke Partij stelt de andere in kennis van de voltooiing van de ingevolge zijn interne recht vereiste procedures voor de toepassing van deze overeenkomst, die in werking treedt met ingang van de datum van de laatste kennisgeving.   
2.  Deze overeenkomst wordt gesloten voor een tijdvak van vijf jaar vanaf haar inwerkingtreding. Tenzij zij zes maanden voor het einde van deze periode wordt opgezegd, wordt zij stilzwijgend op dezelfde voorwaarden voor achtereenvolgende tijdvakken van vijf jaar verlengd.   
3.  De Partij die kennisgeving van opzegging doet, kan aangeven dat zulks slechts geldt voor nader aangeduide artikelen, geografische gebieden of terreinen van activiteiten. In een dergelijk geval blijft de overeenkomst voor het overige van kracht, tenzij zij door de andere Partij of Partijen wordt opgezegd binnen vier maanden na ontvangst van de kennisgeving van gedeeltelijke opzegging.   
4.  De Partijen kunnen te allen tijde de toepassing van deze overeenkomst voor een aangegeven tijdvak schorsen. Ook kunnen zij overeenkomen dat de werkzaamheden van een bepaalde commissie of een bepaald comité worden opgeschort of beëindigd.   

### 1.1  

####Modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake de bevordering van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking

*Inleidende opmerking:* Dit is een modelovereenkomst tussen Staten die algemene basisbepalingen bevat en die afzonderlijk dan wel in samenhang met een of meer van de onderstaande modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten kan worden gesloten. De Regeringen van ... en ... zich bewust van de voordelen van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking, zoals omschreven in de Europese Kaderovereenkomst inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen territoriale gemeenschappen of autoriteiten, zijn overeengekomen als volgt: 

### Artikel  1  

De Partijen verbinden zich ertoe naar middelen tot grensoverschrijdende samenwerking op regionaal en lokaal niveau te zoeken en de aanwending daarvan te bevorderen. Onder grensoverschrijdende samenwerking verstaan zij alle onderling afgestemde bestuurlijke, technische, economische, sociale of culturele maatregelen ter versterking en ontwikkeling van de nabuurbetrekkingen, tussen de gebieden gelegen aan beide zijden van de grens, en de sluiting van passende overeenkomsten ter oplossing van de problemen die zich op dit terrein kunnen voordoen. Met deze maatregelen zou onder meer kunnen worden gestreefd naar verbetering van de voorwaarden voor regionale ontwikkeling en stadsontwikkeling, de bescherming van natuurlijke rijkdommen, wederzijdse hulp in geval van rampen en de verbetering van openbare diensten.  

### Artikel  2  

De Partijen streven ernaar, in onderling overleg, de regionale autoriteiten binnen hun rechtsmacht de benodigde middelen te verschaffen ten einde deze in staat te stellen de samenwerking tot stand te brengen.  

### Artikel  3  

Zij verbinden zich tevens ertoe optreden van lokale autoriteiten aan te moedigen dat is gericht op de totstandbrenging en ontwikkeling van grensoverschrijdende samenwerking.  

### Artikel  4  

De lokale en regionale autoriteiten die deelnemen aan grensoverschrijdende samenwerking overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst, hebben recht op dezelfde faciliteiten en bescherming als wanneer zij op nationaal niveau zouden samenwerken. De bevoegde autoriteiten van elke Partij dragen er zorg voor dat op de begroting de benodigde gelden worden uitgetrokken ter dekking van de lopende kosten van de lichamen die belast zijn met de bevordering van de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking waarin deze Overeenkomst voorziet.  

### Artikel  5  

Elke Partij belast het lichaam, de commissie of instelling, door haar aangewezen, met de bestudering van de huidige nationale wetgeving en voorschriften, ten einde wijzigingen voor te stellen in de bepalingen die de ontwikkeling van lokale grensoverschrijdende samenwerking kunnen belemmeren. Deze lichamen dienen bijzondere aandacht te schenken aan verbetering van de voorschriften op belasting- en douanegebied, van de regels inzake buitenlandse valuta en overmaking van kapitaal en van de procedures inzake optreden van hogere autoriteiten, vooral wat toezicht of controle betreft. Alvorens de in de voorgaande alinea bedoelde stappen te ondernemen, plegen de Partijen voor zover nodig overleg met elkaar en wisselen zij ter zake dienende informatie uit.  

### Artikel  6  

De Partijen trachten, door arbitrage of op andere wijze, een oplossing te vinden voor kwesties van lokaal belang, waarover zij van mening verschillen en ten aanzien waarvan voorafgaande regeling nodig is voor het welslagen van projecten voor grensoverschrijdende samenwerking.  

### 1.2  

####Modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake regionaal grensoverschrijdend overleg

*Inleidende opmerking:* Deze Overeenkomst kan afzonderlijk dan wel in samenhang met een of meer van de modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten worden gesloten (teksten 1.1 tot en met 1.5) 

### Artikel  1  

Ten einde het grensoverschrijdend overleg tussen de regio's, omschreven in het aanhangsel bij deze Overeenkomst, te bevorderen, stellen de Partijen een gemengde commissie in (hierna te noemen „de Commissie”) en indien nodig een of meer regionale comité's (hierna te noemen „Comité's”) ter behandeling van aangelegenheden samenhangend met grensoverschrijdend overleg.  

### Artikel  2  

1.  De Commissie en de Comité's worden gevormd door delegaties, waarvan de leden door elk der Partijen zijn gekozen.   
2.  De delegaties naar de Commissie bestaan uit niet meer dan 8 leden, waarvan ten minste 3 de regionale autoriteiten vertegenwoordigen. De voorzitter van de delegaties naar de Comité's, of hun vertegenwoordigers, nemen in een adviserende hoedanigheid deel aan de werkzaamheden van de Commissie. <sup> 1)  De getallen voor het aantal leden van de Commissie zijn slechts als richtsnoer bedoeld en dienen te worden aangepast aan de situatie; dit geld trouwens voor alle bepalingen in deze model-overeenkomst. Door het geven van getallen hebben de opstellers van de model-overeenkomsten de noodzaak van doelmatig werkende commissies met betrekkelijk weinig leden willen onderstrepen. Ook wensten zij een aanduiding te geven van de door hen redelijk geachte verhouding tussen de vertegenwoordigers van de centrale overheid enerzijds en van de regionale autoriteiten anderzijds.  </sup>   
3.  De Comité's worden gevormd door ... delegaties, die elk uit ... leden bestaan en worden ingesteld op initiatief van de Commissie in overleg met de regionale en lokale autoriteiten van de grensgebieden waarop deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft. De delegaties naar de Comité's bestaan uit vertegenwoordigers van die autoriteiten of van regionale of lokale lichamen. Eén afgevaardigde wordt door de centrale overheid benoemd. Waar passend wordt hij gekozen uit de lichamen die de centrale overheid vertegenwoordigen in de grensgebieden waarvoor de Comité's verantwoordelijk zijn.   
4.  De Commissie komt ten minste eenmaal per jaar bijeen. De Comité's komen bijeen wanneer nodig, doch ten minste tweemaal per jaar.   
5.  De Commissie en de Comité's stellen hun eigen huishoudelijk reglement op.   

### Artikel  3  

Elke Partij draagt de kosten van haar eigen delegatie naar de Commissie. De kosten van de delegaties naar de Comité's worden gedragen door de autoriteiten waaruit deze delegaties zijn samengesteld.  

### Artikel  4  

Ten behoeve van de coördinatie en de continuïteit in het werk van de Commissie en de Comité's, stellen de Partijen indien nodig een secretariaat in, waarvan de samenstelling, de zetel, de werkwijze en de financiering worden neergelegd in een regeling ad hoc tussen de Partijen, zoals voorgesteld door de Commissie. Bij gebreke van overeenstemming tussen de Partijen, kan de Commissie zelf een secretariaat instellen.  

### Artikel  5  

De grensgebieden waarop deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft, worden aangegeven in een Bijlage, waarvan de inhoud door een eenvoudige notawisseling kan worden gewijzigd.  

### Artikel  6  

1.  Er kan grensoverschrijdend overleg worden gepleegd over kwesties die zich voordoen op de onderstaande terreinen: <sup> 1)  Deze lijst is slechts als richtsnoer bedoeld en dient aan elk samenwerkingsproject te worden aangepast. Zij mag niet zo worden uitgelegd als zouden daardoor de bevoegdheden die het interne recht aan territoriale autoriteiten heeft toegekend, worden gewijzigd. Zowel de centrale overheid als de regionale autoriteiten zijn per slot in de commissie vertegenwoordigd.  </sup> 

- stadsontwikkeling en regionale ontwikkeling;  

- vervoer en verbindingen (openbaar vervoer, wegen en snelwegen, gemeenschappelijke luchthavens, waterwegen, zeehavens, enz.);  

- energie (energiecentrales, gas-, elektriciteits- en watervoorziening);  

- natuurbescherming (plaatsen die bescherming behoeven, recreatiegebieden, natuurparken, enz.);  

- bescherming van het water (bestrijding van verontreiniging, zuiveringsinstallaties, enz.);  

- bescherming van de leefomgeving (luchtverontreiniging, lawaaibestrijding, stiltegebieden, enz.);  

- onderwijs, opleiding en onderzoek;  

- gezondheidszorg (bijv. gebruik van de medische voorzieningen in een van de gebieden door de inwoners van een ander gebied);  

- cultuur, vrijetijdsbesteding en sportbeoefening (schouwburgen, orkesten, sportcentra, vakantiehuisen en -kampen, jeugdcentra, enz.);  

- wederzijdse hulpverlening bij rampen (brand, overstromingen, epidemieën, vliegtuigongevallen, aardbevingen, ongevallen in de bergen, enz.);  

- toerisme (gezamenlijke projecten voor de bevordering van het toerisme);  

- problemen betreffende grensarbeiders (vervoersvoorzieningen, huisvesting, sociale zekerheid, belastingen, werkgelegenheid, werkloosheid, enz.);  

- economische projecten (vestiging van nieuwe industrieën, enz.);  

- diverse projecten (installaties voor afvalverwerking, riolering, enz.);  

- verbetering van de landbouwstructuur;  

- sociale voorzieningen.     
2.  De Partijen kunnen overeenkomen deze lijst te wijzigen door een eenvoudige notawisseling.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  Tenzij anders bepaald, is de Commissie belast met het behandelen van algemene en van principiële kwesties, zoals het opstellen van programma's voor de Comité's, coördinatie en contacten met de betrokken centrale overheden en met gemengde commissie's die ingesteld waren voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst.    
2.  In het bijzonder is de Commissie belast met het eventueel voorleggen aan de onderscheiden regeringen van haar eigen aanbevelingen en die van de Comité's, en van ontwerpen voor te sluiten internationale overeenkomsten.   
3.  De Commissie kan deskundigen inschakelen voor de bestudering van bepaalde kwesties.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  De voornaamste taak van de Comité's is het bestuderen van problemen die zich voordoen op de in artikel 6 aangegeven gebieden en het naar aanleiding daarvan doen van voorstellen en aanbevelingen. Dergelijke problemen kunnen aan de Comité's worden voorgelegd door de Commissie, door de centrale, regionale of lokale autoriteiten van de Partijen en door instellingen, verenigingen of andere publiekrechtelijke of privaatrechtelijke lichamen. Zij kunnen ook op eigen initiatief aangelegenheden behandelen.   
2.  De Comité's kunnen, ten behoeve van de bestudering van deze aangelegenheden, werkgroepen in het leven roepen. Zij kunnen ook deskundigen inschakelen en om juridische adviezen of technische rapporten verzoeken. De Comité's trachten, via een zo breed mogelijk overleg, te komen tot resultaten die in overeenstemming zijn met de belangen van de betrokken bevolking.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De Comité's stellen de Commissie in kennis van de aan hen voorgelegde aangelegenheden en van de bevindingen waartoe zij zijn gekomen.   
2.  Wanneer over hun bevindingen beslissingen moeten worden genomen door de Commissie of de onderscheiden regeringen, doen de Comité's aanbevelingen aan de Commissie.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  Zowel de Commissie als de Comité's zijn bevoegd aangelegenheden van gemeenschappelijk belang te regelen die aan hen zijn voorgelegd met instemming van de leden, mits hun leden overeenkomstig de wetgeving van de Partijen daartoe bevoegd zijn.   
2.  De Commissie en de Comité's wisselen informatie uit over de in dit opzicht genomen beslissingen.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  De delegaties naar de Commissie of de Comité's wisselen informatie uit over door de bevoegde autoriteiten genomen maatregelen naar aanleiding van aanbevelingen gedaan of ontwerpovereenkomsten opgesteld in overeenstemming met artikel 7, tweede lid en artikel 9, tweede lid.   
2.  De Commissie en de Comité's overwegen de actie die moet worden genomen naar aanleiding van door de in het eerste lid bedoelde bevoegde autoriteiten genomen maatregelen.   

### 1.3  

####Modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake lokaal grensoverschrijdend overleg

*Inleidende opmerking:* Deze Overeenkomst kan afzonderlijk dan wel in samenhang met een of meer van de modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten worden gesloten (teksten 1.1 tot en met 1.5). 

### Artikel  1  

Ten einde een ruimere uitwisseling van informatie te verzekeren en te komen tot overleg tussen lokale autoriteiten aan beide zijden van de grens, verzoeken de Partijen deze autoriteiten in comité's van overleg gezamenlijk studie te maken van vraagstukken van gemeenschappelijk belang.  

### Artikel  2  

Het huishoudelijk reglement van zulke comité's wordt door hun leden in onderling overleg opgesteld. De hogere autoriteiten worden bij hun werkzaamheden betrokken of daarvan op de hoogte gehouden. Ingeval in de betrokken gebieden regionale commissies van grensoverschrijdend overleg zijn ingesteld, worden de comité's van overleg betrokken bij het werk van die commissies op door deze te stellen voorwaarden. Hunnerzijds verlenen deze commissies hulp bij het werk van de comité's van overleg. De comité's kunnen ook optreden als advieslichaam in verband met de uitvoering van bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen Staten die zijn gesloten in het kader van de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking.  

### Artikel  3  

De taak van de comités van overleg is het organiseren van de uitwisseling van informatie en van onderling overleg, alsook het bestuderen van aangelegenheden van gemeenschappelijk belang en het bepalen van gemeenschappelijke doelstellingen. In hun werkzaamheden eerbiedigen zij de eigen verantwoordelijkheid van hun leden en er vindt geen overdracht van bevoegdheden plaats. De leden van deze comité's kunnen evenwel binnen het kader van samenwerkingsovereenkomsten te zamen beslissen welke maatregelen of beperkingen voor hun onderscheiden werkzaamheden zullen gelden, of welke procedures voor voorafgaand overleg zij voornemens zijn te volgen.  

### Artikel  4  

####(alternatief)

Ter vergemakkelijking van het werk van deze comité's van overleg kunnen de betrokken lokale autoriteiten, binnen de grenzen van de ingevolge de binnenlandse wetgeving aan hen toegekende bevoegdheden, verenigingen in het leven roepen als juridische basis voor hun samenwerking. Deze verenigingen worden opgericht ingevolge het burgerlijk recht of het handelsrecht dat van toepassing is op verenigingen in een van de betrokken Staten. Voor de toepassing van het gekozen rechtsstelsel blijven, indien daarvan sprake is, de voorwaarden, formaliteiten en bijzondere machtigingen betreffende de nationaliteit van de leden van deze verenigingen buiten beschouwing. De overeenkomstig artikel 2 aan hogere autoriteiten verstrekte informatie omvat alle inlichtingen omtrent de activiteiten van de in dit artikel bedoelde verenigingen.  

### 1.4  

####Modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake contractuele grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen lokale autoriteiten

*Inleidende opmerking:* Deze Overeenkomst kan afzonderlijk dan wel in samenhang met een of meer van de ontwerpovereenkomsten tussen Staten worden gesloten (teksten 1.1 tot en met 1.5). 

### Artikel  1  

Grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen lokale lichamen vindt onder meer plaats door middel van administratiefrechtelijke, economische of technische contracten.  

### Artikel  2  

De contracten inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking worden gesloten door de lokale autoriteiten binnen de grenzen van hun bevoegdheden ingevolge het interne recht. Zij hebben onder meer betrekking op de levering van goederen of de verlening van diensten, gezamenlijk optreden, het vormen van verenigingen opgericht op de grondslag van het burgerlijk recht of het handelsrecht van een van de Staten die partij zijn, of op het lidmaatschap van een zodanige vereniging. <sup> 1)  Deze paragraaf kan al dan niet worden opgenomen, zonder dat daardoor afbreuk wordt gedaan aan de samenhang van deze overeenkomst.  </sup>  

### Artikel  3  

De partijen bij een zodanig contract geven aan welk recht daarop van toepassing is door verwijzing naar het contractenrecht (zowel publiek als privaatrechtelijk) van een van de Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst. Zij geven tevens, voor zover noodzakelijk, de afwijkingen aan die kunnen worden gemaakt van de bepalingen van dat recht welke niet verbindend zijn. Indien er geen desbetreffende bepaling in het contract is opgenomen, is het toepasselijke recht dat van de Staat van de lokale autoriteit die ingevolge het contract verantwoordelijk is voor het verlenen van de voornaamste dienst, of bij gebreke daarvan, de lokale autoriteit met het grootste financiële belang. In alle gevallen behouden de personen onder de rechtsmacht van de lokale autoriteiten die partij zijn bij het contract, alle rechtsvorderingen en rechtsmiddelen tegen genoemde autoriteiten, die zij zouden hebben gehad ten aanzien van deze autoriteiten, indien deze zelf belast zouden zijn gebleven met de taak de genoemde personen de desbetreffende goederen te leveren of diensten te verlenen. De lokale autoriteiten tegen wie zulke rechtsvorderingen worden ingesteld of zulke rechtsmiddelen worden aangewend, zijn gerechtigd een regresprocedure in te stellen tegen de lokale autoriteiten die zich hebben belast met het leveren van de goederen of het verlenen van de diensten.  

### Artikel  4  

Voorstellen voor het sluiten of wijzigen van contracten worden tegelijkertijd in elke Staat onderworpen aan de gewone regels inzake het optreden van hogere autoriteiten. Goedkeuring door de autoriteiten die partij zijn bij het contract is evenwel niet vereist. Aan een beslissing, genomen door een hogere autoriteit die het sluiten of toepassen van een contract inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking kan belemmeren, dan wel het ontbinden van een zodanig contract kan veroorzaken, dient overleg met de overeenkomstige hogere autoriteiten van de betrokken andere Staten vooraf te gaan.  

### Artikel  5  

In geval van een geschil wordt de bevoegde rechterlijke autoriteit door het toepasselijke recht bepaald. Contracten inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking kunnen evenwel arbitrageclausules bevatten. Desondanks behouden cliënten en derden alle bestaande rechtsmiddelen jegens de lokale autoriteiten van de Staat waartoe zij behoren, terwijl die autoriteiten verhaal kunnen zoeken op de in gebreke zijnde partij bij het contract. De hogere autoriteiten nemen alle maatregelen waartoe zij bevoegd zijn ter verzekering van de onverwijlde tenuitvoerlegging van rechterlijke beslissingen, ongeacht de nationaliteit van de rechtbank die deze beslissingen heeft gegeven.  

### Artikel  6  

Ingevolge deze Overeenkomst gesloten contracten blijven van kracht na opzegging van deze Overeenkomst. De contracten zullen evenwel een clausule bevatten waarbij de partijen gemachtigd worden zodanige contracten te beëindigen, met inachtneming van een opzegtermijn van vijf jaar, ingeval van opzegging van deze Overeenkomst. De Staten die Partij zijn, hebben de bevoegdheid de toepassing van deze clausule af te dwingen.  

### 1.5  

####Modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake organen voor grensoverschrijdende samenwerking tussen lokale autoriteiten

*Inleidende opmerking:* Deze Overeenkomst kan afzonderlijk dan wel in samenhang met een of meer van de modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten worden gesloten (teksten 1.1 tot en met 1.5). 

### Artikel  1  

Voor de doeleinden die zij ingevolge het interne recht kunnen nastreven door middel van een vereniging of belangengroeperingen, kunnen lokale autoriteiten en andere publiekrechtelijke lichamen deelnemen aan verenigingen of belangengroeperingen van lokale autoriteiten, opgericht op het grondgebied van een andere Partij overeenkomstig het interne recht van die Partij.  

### Artikel  2  

Binnen de grenzen van de bevoegdheden van hun leden zijn de in artikel 1 bedoelde verenigingen of belangengroeperingen gerechtigd hun uit hun statutaire doel voortvloeiende werkzaamheden te verrichten op het grondgebied van elk der betrokken Partijen. Hierbij zijn zij onderworpen aan de door die Staat vastgestelde regels, tenzij die Staat uitzonderingen daarop toelaat.  

### Artikel  3  

1.  De akte van oprichting van de vereniging of de belangengroepering, de statuten, en de wijzigingen daarvan, zijn onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de hogere autoriteiten van alle deelnemende lokale autoriteiten. Hetzelfde geldt voor de toelating tot een reeds bestaande vereniging of belangengroepering.   
2.  De betrokken bevolking wordt overeenkomstig de gewone regelingen voor openbaarmaking van elke Staat, op de hoogte gesteld van die akten en van de goedkeuring daarvan. Hetzelfde geldt voor wijzigingen van de zetel en voor beslissingen betreffende de personen die gemachtigd zijn namens de vereniging of belangengroepering op te treden, en betreffende de grenzen van hun bevoegdheden.   
3.  Bovenbedoelde akten worden opgesteld in de officiële talen die in gebruik zijn in elk van de Staten waar zij moeten worden toegepast. Alle teksten zijn gelijkelijk authentiek.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  De statuten regelen de rechtsbetrekkingen van de vereniging of de belangengroeperingen. Zij dienen de door de overeenkomstig artikel 1 toepasselijke wetgeving vereiste gegevens te bevatten. In elk geval dienen zij aan te geven welke lichamen lid zijn, en de naam en zetel van de vereniging of belangengroepering te vermelden. Zij dienen het doel van de vereniging of belangengroepering te bepalen en waar passend, de functie en de plaats van vestiging van te gebruiken installaties. Zij dienen de wijze van aanstelling van de beheers- en bestuursorganen te bepalen, de reikwijdte van de verplichtingen van de leden en hun bijdrage in de gemeenschappelijke uitgaven. Van de beheersorganen dient ten minste één vertegenwoordiger van de lokale autoriteiten van elk land die lid zijn deel uit te maken. De statuten dienen de samenstelling en de wijze van beraadslagen van de Algemene Vergadering te bepalen, de vorm van de notulen, de wijze van ontbinding of opheffing en de regels inzake de begrotingen en het voeren van de boekhouding.   
2.  De statuten dienen ook een bepaling te bevatten volgens welke de leden zich kunnen terugtrekken uit de vereniging, met inachtneming van een in de statuten bepaalde opzegtermijn, en na betaling van eventuele schulden aan de vereniging en van een schadevergoeding aan de vereniging, volgens taxatie door deskundigen met betrekking tot door de vereniging voor of namens de betrokken leden verrichte investeringen of gemaakte kosten. Zij dienen ook regels aan te geven inzake het ontslag of de uitsluiting van een lid wegens niet-nakoming van zijn verbintenissen.   

### Artikel  5  

De Partijen verbinden zich ertoe de vereiste machtigingen te verlenen voor de vervulling door de vereniging of belangengroepering van haar taken binnen haar grondgebied, zulks onder voorbehoud van de eisen gesteld door de openbare orde en veiligheid.   

### Artikel  6  

Wanneer de vereniging of belangengroepering, ingevolge het interne recht, op het grondgebied van een Staat niet over bepaalde bevoegdheden, rechten of voordelen kan beschikken die nodig zijn voor het vervullen van haar taken ten behoeve van de lokale autoriteiten van die Staat die lid zijn, hebben laatstgenoemden het recht en de plicht op te treden voor en namens de vereniging of belangengroepering ten einde deze bevoegdheden, rechten of voordelen uit te oefenen dan wel te verwerven.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  De bevoegdheden inzake toezicht of controle op de vereniging of belangengroepering worden, overeenkomstig het interne recht, uitgeoefend door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staat waar de zetel is gevestigd. Deze autoriteiten dragen er tevens zorg voor dat de belangen van de lokale autoriteiten van andere Staten in acht worden genomen.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de andere Staten hebben recht op informatie omtrent de werkzaamheden en besluiten van de vereniging of belangengroepering en omtrent handelingen verricht bij de uitoefening van het toezicht of de controle. In het bijzonder worden hun, op verzoek, de aangenomen teksten en notulen van de vergaderingen van de organen van de vereniging of belangengroepering verstrekt, de jaarrekeningen en de ontwerpbegroting, zo deze er zijn, voor zover door het interne recht wordt vereist dat deze ter kennis worden gebracht van de voor toezicht of controle verantwoordelijke autoriteiten. Zij kunnen rechtstreeks in verbinding treden met de organen van de vereniging of belangengroepering en met de toezicht of controle uitoefenende autoriteiten, aan deze commentaar voorleggen of deze vragen rechtstreeks te worden geraadpleegd in bepaalde gevallen en inzake bepaalde aangelegenheden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de andere Staten hebben tevens het recht de vereniging of belangengroepering ervan in kennis te stellen dat zij er bezwaar tegen hebben dat de onder hun rechtsmacht vallende gemeenschappen blijven deelnemen aan de vereniging of belangengroepering. Een zodanige kennisgeving, met redenen omkleed, wordt geacht een grond te zijn voor uitsluiting en dient als zodanig te worden vermeld in de statuten. De in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde autoriteiten zijn ook gerechtigd zich te doen vertegenwoordigen door een afgevaardigde naar de beheersorganen van de vereniging of belangengroepering; deze afgevaardigde heeft het recht alle vergaderingen van genoemde organen bij te wonen en hun agenda's en notulen te ontvangen.   

### Artikel  8  

De leveranties of dienstverlening die overeenkomstig de statuten aan de vereniging of de belangengroepering worden toevertrouwd op het grondgebied van haar leden, worden verricht onder haar verantwoordelijkheid met volledige kwijting van haar leden van hun verplichtingen te dien aanzien. De vereniging of belangengroepering is ook aansprakelijk jegens cliënten en derden. Laatstgenoemden behouden evenwel ten aanzien van de lokale autoriteiten voor en namens wie de leveranties of dienstverlening worden verricht, alle rechtsvorderingen en rechtsmiddelen die zij zouden hebben indien deze autoriteiten zelf de verplichting hadden behouden hun de desbetreffende leveranties te doen of de desbetreffende diensten te verlenen. De autoriteiten tegen wie zulke rechtsvorderingen worden ingesteld of zulke rechtsmiddelen worden aangewend, hebben zelf een regresrecht jegens de vereniging of belangengroepering.  

### Artikel  9  

1.  Bij gebreke van bemiddeling worden geschillen tussen de vereniging en de leden daarvan, of tussen verschillende leden, betreffende de functionering van de vereniging, voorgelegd aan de bestuurlijke en gerechtelijke autoriteiten van de Staat waar de zetel van de vereniging of belangengroeperingen is gevestigd.   
2.  Alle andere geschillen dan die bedoeld in het eerste lid kunnen aan de bestuurlijke en gerechtelijke autoriteiten worden voorgelegd overeenkomstig de gewone in het grondgebied van de Partij zijnde Staten geldende regels, tenzij de betrokkenen besluiten het geschil voor te leggen aan een door hen aan te wijzen scheidsrechterlijke instantie.   
3.  De Staten die Partij zijn, nemen de nodige maatregelen ten einde zorg te dragen voor de tenuitvoerlegging op hun grondgebied van beslissingen en vonnissen voortvloeiend uit de bovenstaande bepalingen.   

### Artikel  10  

De ter toepassing van deze overeenkomst opgerichte verenigingen of belangengroeperingen blijven in stand na opzegging van deze Overeenkomst, zij het onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 7, derde lid.

####KADEROVEREENKOMSTEN, -STATUTEN EN -CONTRACTEN TUSSEN LOKALE AUTORITEITEN

*Inleidende opmerking:*  
###Kaderovereenkomsten, -contracten en -statuten bedoeld voor lokale autoriteiten

Evenals Staten zou lokale autoriteiten een keuze van overeenkomsten en contracten kunnen worden geboden. In feite bestaat zulk een keuze in een aantal landen reeds, zoals blijkt uit de grote reeds bijeengebrachte hoeveelheid documentatie inzake gesloten overeenkomsten. Het voorgestelde systeem omvat zes kaderovereenkomsten, -contracten en -statuten, die voorzien in een uiteenlopende mate en vorm van lokale grensoverschrijdende samenwerking. Afhankelijk van de werkingssfeer en stand van de nationale wetgeving kunnen deze kaderteksten zonder meer worden gebruikt, dan wel na aanneming van een overeenkomst tussen Staten inzake hun gebruik. In het algemeen kan het sluiten van overeenkomsten tussen Staten, zelfs wanneer zulks niet absoluut noodzakelijk schijnt, bijdragen tot een duidelijkere omschrijving van de voorwaarden waarop deze overeenkomsten door de lokale autoriteiten kunnen worden gehanteerd. In elk geval lijkt het sluiten van een overeenkomst tussen Staten geboden bij gebruikmaking van overeenkomst 2.6 (organen voor grensoverschrijdende samenwerking). Dit systeem van kaderovereenkomsten ten behoeve van lokale autoriteiten komt overeen met de modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten. In de inleidende opmerking bij elke kadertekst wordt naar de overeenkomsten tussen Staten verwezen. Zo is het mogelijk de overeenkomsten en organen die op lokaal niveau tot stand zijn gekomen, te integreren in de structuren voor grensoverschrijdend overleg die in het leven zullen worden geroepen op regionaal of nationaal niveau. De lokale coördinatiecommissies (kadertekst 2.1) zouden bijvoorbeeld kunnen worden geïntegreerd in de structuur van de Commissies, Comités en werkgroepen bedoeld in de modelovereenkomst tussen Staten inzake regionaal grensoverschrijdend overleg (1.2). Voorts zijn deze modellen ontworpen in de vorm van een schema, aangezien onmogelijk alle problemen die zich van geval tot geval zouden kunnen voordoen, in een algemeen overzicht kunnen worden samengevat. De kaderteksten zijn een nuttig richtsnoer, doch kunnen worden gewijzigd naar gelang de behoeften van de lokale autoriteiten die er gebruik van maken. Ook moeten de lokale autoriteiten middelen vinden om de deelneming van burgers aan grensoverschrijdend overleg in de sociaal-culturele sfeer aan te moedigen. Zulke deelneming zal beslist de psychologische hinderpalen kunnen wegnemen die de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking soms in ernstige mate belemmeren. Door belangstelling van het publiek gesteund overleg zal zo een hechtere grondslag verwerven. Een van de wijzen waarop deelneming door het publiek kan worden bevorderd, is gebruikmaking van een vereniging. Een van de kaderteksten (2.3) heeft derhalve betrekking op het oprichten van een privaatrechtelijke vereniging. 

### 2.1  

####Kaderovereenkomst inzake de instelling van een groep voor overleg tussen lokale autoriteiten

*Inleidende opmerking:* Gewoonlijk kan zulk een groep in het leven worden geroepen zonder dat er een overeenkomst tussen Staten nodig is. Er zijn talrijke voorbeelden van zulke mogelijkheden. Indien er evenwel juridische of andere onzekerheden ter zake bestaan, zou een overeenkomst tussen Staten de voorwaarden voor een zodanige coördinatie kunnen vastleggen (zie modelovereenkomst 1.3). 
### *Doel en zetel van de groep* 

### Artikel  1  

De lokale autoriteiten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst verbinden zich tot coördinatie van hun activiteiten op de volgende binnen hun bevoegdheden vallende terreinen (terrein(en) nader aangeven of verwijzen naar „lokale vraagstukken”). Hiertoe richten zij bij deze een coördinatiegroep op, hierna te noemen „de groep”, die haar zetel heeft te .... De taak van de groep is te zorgen voor de uitwisseling van gegevens, de coördinatie en het overleg tussen haar leden op de terreinen aangegeven in de voorgaande alinea. De autoriteiten die lid zijn van de groep verbinden zich tot het verstrekken van alle nodige gegevens voor het vervullen van haar taak en tot onderling overleg binnen de groep, alvorens over te gaan tot het besluiten op de boven aangegeven terreinen.  

### *Lidmaatschap* 

### Artikel  2  

Elke deelnemende lokale autoriteit wordt in de groep vertegenwoordigd door een delegatie van ... door haar benoemde leden. Elke delegatie kan, met instemming van de groep, worden vergezeld door vertegenwoordigers van particuliere sociaal-economische lichamen en door deskundigen (dit alternatief sluit andere eenheden dan lokale autoriteiten uit van het lidmaatschap, waardoor deze regeling zich onderscheidt van de privaatrechtelijke vereniging die onder 2.3 wordt behandeld). Mogelijke variant: Het aantal leden van elke delegatie kan uiteenlopen. Het lidmaatschap staat open voor lokale en regionale autoriteiten, sociaal-economische groeperingen en particulieren die aan deze Overeenkomst deelnemen. De groep beslist over de toelating van nieuwe leden. Elke delegatie kan, met instemming van de groep, worden vergezeld door vertegenwoordigers van particuliere organisaties en door deskundigen.  

### *Mandaat* 

### Artikel  3  

De groep kan alle in artikel 1 aangegeven aangelegenheden bespreken. Alle vraagstukken waaromtrent consensus wordt bereikt, en de aanbevelingen aan de desbetreffende autoriteiten of groeperingen waartoe de groep besluit, worden opgenomen in de notulen. De groep is bevoegd opdracht te geven tot studies en onderzoeken inzake onder haar bevoegdheid vallende aangelegenheden.  

### Artikel  4  

De leden van de groep kunnen overeenkomen de groep te belasten met de uitvoering van bepaalde welomschreven praktische taken. De groep kan ook door andere instellingen aan haar opgedragen taken uitvoeren.

De groep stelt haar eigen huishoudelijk reglement vast.  

### Artikel  6  

De groep komt in de regel tweemaal per jaar bijeen, of op verzoek van een derde van haar leden die voorstellen een punt op haar agenda te plaatsen. Kennisgeving van de vergadering en toezending van de agenda dienen ten minste vijftien dagen van te voren te geschieden, opdat de besprekingen door elk van de vertegenwoordigde instellingen kunnen worden voorbereid.  

### Artikel  7  

De groep benoemt uit haar leden een permanent bureau; zij bepaalt wie daarvan lid zijn en wat daarvan de bevoegdheden zijn. Het voorzitterschap wordt bekleed overeenkomstig het huishoudelijk reglement of, wanneer dit niet van toepassing is, door het oudste aanwezige lid.  

### *Betrekkingen met buitenstaanders en hogere autoriteiten* 

### Artikel  8  

In haar betrekkingen met buitenstaanders wordt de groep vertegenwoordigd door haar voorzitter, tenzij in het huishoudelijk reglement anders is bepaald. Hogere autoriteiten waartoe leden van de groep behoren, kunnen van de groep desgevraagd informatie verkrijgen inzake de werkzaamheden van de groep en zijn bevoegd een waarnemer naar haar vergaderingen te zenden.  

### *Secretariaat en financiën* 

### Artikel  9  

Het secretariaat wordt verzorgd door een van de lid zijnde instellingen (met of zonder een stelsel van jaarlijkse vervanging). Elke autoriteit dient bij te dragen in de kosten van het secretariaat zoals hieronder nader aangegeven: ..... Informatie en stukken worden in de regel rondgestuurd in de taal van de Staat van oorsprong.  

### *Toetreding en terugtrekking* 

### Artikel  10  

Het lidmaatschap van de groep staat open voor andere lokale en regionale autoriteiten die aan deze overeenkomst deelnemen. De groep beslist over de toelating van nieuwe leden.  

### Artikel  11  

Een lid kan zich terugtrekken uit de groep door middel van een daartoe strekkende kennisgeving aan de voorzitter. De terugtrekking van een lid uit de groep is niet van invloed op het functioneren van de groep, tenzij de groep anders beslist.  

### Artikel  12  

De Partijen stellen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa in kennis van het sluiten van deze overeenkomst en verstrekken hem de tekst daarvan.  

### 2.2  

####Kaderovereenkomst inzake coördinatie van het regelen van grensoverschrijdende lokale openbare aangelegenheden

*Inleidende opmerking:* In verschillende Staten is dit soort overeenkomst inzake grensoverschrijdende samenwerking reeds mogelijk. Wanneer zulks niet het geval is, dienen de voorwaarden waarop een zodanige overeenkomst zou kunnen worden gehanteerd, te worden omschreven in het kader van een overeenkomst tussen Staten (zie model-overeenkomst 1.3). 
### *Doel van de overeenkomst* 

### Artikel  1  

Artikel 1 omschrijft het doel van de overeenkomst (bijv. harmonische ontwikkeling van grensgebieden) en het desbetreffende werkterrein.  

### *Grondgebied waarop de overeenkomst betrekking heeft* 

### Artikel  2  

Artikel 2 dient de grondgebieden aan te geven waarop de overeenkomst betrekking heeft aan beide zijden (of aan de drie zijden) van de grens.  

### *Verplichtingen* 

### Artikel  3  

Artikel 3 dient de middelen te omschrijven ter verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van de overeenkomst (artikel 1). Afhankelijk van het eigenlijke doel van de overeenkomst kunnen de onderstaande verplichtingen worden aangegeven; 

- de Partijen verbinden zich tot toepassing van een procedure voor voorafgaand overleg alvorens besluiten te nemen omtrent een aantal maatregelen die zij moeten nemen binnen de grenzen van hun bevoegdheden en van het door hen bestuurde grondgebied;  

- de Partijen verbinden zich ertoe, binnen hun grondgebied en binnen de grenzen van hun bevoegdheden de noodzakelijke maatregelen te nemen ter verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van de overeenkomst;  

- de Partijen verbinden zich ertoe, niets te ondernemen dat afbreuk zou kunnen doen aan de doelstellingen van deze overeenkomst.    

### *Coördinatie* 

### Artikel  4  

Artikel 4 dient, al naar de omstandigheden en eisen van elke overeenkomst, de regelingen voor coördinatie aan te geven: 

- door als coördinatiegroep aan te wijzen de algemene groep voor overleg, bedoeld in kaderovereenkomst 2.1;  

- of door te voorzien in de oprichting van een specifieke groep voor overleg inzake de doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst;  

- of eenvoudigweg door middel van rechtstreekse bilaterale contacten tussen de betrokken autoriteiten.    

### *Bemiddeling* 

### Artikel  5  

Elk lid van de groep (elke Partij, indien er geen groep is) kan aan de groep (de andere Partij, indien er geen groep is) elk geval voorleggen waarin het van oordeel is dat de overeenkomst niet is nagekomen doordat: 

- er geen voorafgaand overleg heeft plaatsgevonden; of  

- de genomen maatregelen niet in overeenstemming is met de overeenkomst; of  

- de noodzakelijke maatregelen ter verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van de overeenkomst niet zijn genomen.   Indien de Partijen geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken, kan het geschil worden voorgelegd aan een bemiddelinfiscommissie belast met de waarborging van de naleving van de aangegane verbintenissen.  

### *Orgaan van toezicht* 

### Artikel  6  

De Partijen kunnen overeenkomen een speciaal orgaan van toezicht op te richten ter waarborging van de naleving van de aangegane verbintenissen, bestaande uit een gelijk aantal door elke Partij benoemde deskundigen en een neutrale deskundige; diens benoeming of de wijze waarop deze wordt benoemd worden vooraf bepaald.

### Artikel  7  

De Partijen stellen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa in kennis van het sluiten van deze overeenkomst en verstrekken hem de tekst daarvan.  

### 2.3  

####Kaderovereenkomst inzake oprichting van grensoverschrijdende privaatrechtelijke verenigingen

*Inleidende opmerking:* Er wordt van uitgegaan dat een lokale autoriteit van een Staat kan deelnemen aan een privaatrechtelijke vereniging van een andere Staat overeenkomstig dezelfde regels en voorwaarden die gelden voor de deelneming van die lokale autoriteit aan een privaatrechtelijke vereniging in de eigen Staat. Indien zulks momenteel niet het geval is, dient deze mogelijkheid uitdrukkelijk te worden geschapen door middel van een overeenkomst tussen de betrokken Staten (zie modelovereenkomsten tussen Staten 1.3 en 1.4). Privaatrechtelijke verenigingen dienen gewoonlijk te voldoen aan de regels vervat in de wet van het land waar zij hun zetel hebben. In de onderstaande lijst zijn de bepalingen vermeld die in hun statuten dienen te worden opgenomen, wanneer zulks niet bij de wet is aangegeven. De bepalingen betreffende overleggroepen (zie kaderovereenkomst 2.1) kunnen mutatis mutandis ook gelden voor dit soort verenigingen. In de statuten van de vereniging dienen te worden vermeld: 

1. de leden-oprichters en de voorwaarden voor de toelating van nieuwe leden;  

2. haar naam, zetel en juridische vorm (onder verwijzing naar de desbetreffende nationale wetgeving);  

3. haar doel, de wijze van verwezenlijking van dit doel en de middelen waarover de vereniging kan beschikken;  

4. haar organen en inzonderheid de functies en werkwijze van haar algemene vergadering (vertegenwoordiging en stemprocedure);  

5. de wijze van benoeming van bestuurders of uitvoerende functionarissen en hun bevoegdheden;  

6. de mate van aansprakelijkheid van de leden jegens derden;  

7. de voorwaarden voor wijziging van de statuten en voor opheffing van de vereniging;  

8. een verplichting van de Partijen om de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa in kennis te stellen van de oprichting van een grensverschrijdende vereniging en om hem de statuten daarvan te verstrekken.    

### 2.4  

####Kadercontract inzake leveranties of verlening van diensten tussen lokale autoriteiten in grensgebieden (privaatrechtelijk)

*Inleidende opmerking:* Er wordt van uitgegaan dat de lokale autoriteiten het recht hebben een zodanig contract te sluiten met lokale autoriteiten van andere landen. Indien zulks niet het geval is, dient deze mogelijkheid te worden geschapen in het kader van een overeenkomst tussen Staten (zie modelovereenkomst 1.4). Dit is een soort contract dat door lokale autoriteiten kan worden gebruikt voor koop-, huur- en aannemingscontracten, de leverantie van goederen of de verlening van diensten, de overdracht van exploitatievergunningen, enz. Het gebruik door lokale autoriteiten van „privaatrechtelijke” contracten wordt in uiteenlopende mate toegestaan door de nationale wetgeving en praktijk en het is moeilijk een onderscheid te maken tussen „publiekrechtelijke” en „privaatrechtelijke” contracten. Niettemin kan ervan worden uitgegaan dat dit soort contract kan worden gebruikt wanneer er, overeenkomstig de heersende interpretatie in elk land, sprake is van een handeling van commerciële of economische aard, waarvoor ook een particulier of rechtspersoon een contract zou hebben kunnen sluiten. In het geval van werkzaamheden die een optreden door lokale autoriteiten met zich brengen in de uitoefening van aan het openbaar gezag voorbehouden functies moet, behalve met de onderstaande bepalingen, tevens rekening worden gehouden met de aanvullende regels aangegeven in het „publiekrechtelijk” modelcontract (zie 2.5). 
### *Partijen* 

Artikel 1 geeft aan welke autoriteiten Partij zijn (en of de overeenkomst openstaat voor andere lokale autoriteiten). Artikel 2 geeft de problemen aan die samenhangen met de algemene bevoegdheid tot het sluiten van contracten en inzonderheid de begunstigden en de voorwaarden en bedingen. Wanneer dienstig, kunnen in dit artikel tevens de vereiste voorbehouden worden opgenomen betreffende machtiging door hogere autoriteiten, voor zover dit een voorwaarde is voor de toepasbaarheid van het contract. 
### *Doel van het contract* 

Artikel 3 geeft het doel van het contract aan door verwijzing naar: 

- bepaalde aangelegenheden;  

- geografische gebieden;  

- lichamen (gemeenten, nationale lichamen met lokale bevoegdheden, enz.);  

- bepaalde juridische vormen. Artikel 4 vermeldt de duur van het contract, de voorwaarden voor verlenging en eventueel de data van voltooiing.   
### *Rechtsstelsel en financiële bepalingen* 

Artikel 5 vermeldt de plaats van ondertekening en uitvoering van het contract en geeft het rechtsstelsel aan waaronder het valt (internationaal privaatrecht), alsmede de toepasselijke wet. Artikel 6 behandelt, wanneer dienstig, de financiële aangelegenheden (valuta waarin betaling dient te geschieden en de wijze van prijsaanpassing in geval van langlopende dienstverlening) en verzekeringen. 
### *Arbitrage* 

Artikel 7 voorziet in een bemiddelingsprocedure, indien nodig, en in een arbitrageprocedure. In geval van arbitrage wordt het scheidsgerecht als volgt samengesteld: 

- elke partij met tegengestelde belangen wijst (variant: de presidenten van het administratieve gerecht die bevoegd zijn ten aanzien van elk der partijen, wijzen) een lid van het scheidsgerecht aan en de partijen benoemen gezamenlijk een of twee onafhankelijke leden zodat het aantal leden oneven is;  

- wanneer het scheidgerecht een even aantal leden heeft en de stemmen staken, heeft het onafhankelijke lid een beslissende stem.   
### *Wijziging en beëindiging van het contract* 

Artikel 8 vermeldt de regels die van toepassing zijn in geval van wijziging of beëindiging van het contract. Artikel 9. De Partijen stellen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa in kennis van het sluiten van deze overeenkomst en verstrekken hem de tekst daarvan. 

### 2.5  

####Kadercontract inzake leveranties of verlenging van diensten tussen lokale autoriteiten in grensgebieden („publiekrechtelijk”)

*Inleidende opmerking:* Dit soort contract is soortgelijk aan dat behandeld onder 2.4 („privaatrechtelijke” contracten) doordat het betrekking heeft op een bepaald doel. Dit soort betreft in het bijzonder vergunningen of contracten voor openbare diensten of (openbare) werken (of diensten of werken die als „openbaar” worden beschouwd door een van de betrokken landen) of het verstrekken van financiële bijdragen door de ene autoriteit aan een andere aan de andere zijde van de grens. De vergunning voor dergelijke openbare diensten brengt bijzondere risico's en verantwoordelijkheden met zich die samenhangen met de verschafte openbare diensten; zulks vereist opneming in het contract van andere bepalingen, naast die aangegeven in het „privaatrechtelijke” modelcontract. <sup> 1)  Deze regeling zou bijzonder nuttig kunnen zijn voor grensautoriteiten, b.v. in het geval van verontreiniging: de ene autoriteit zou de andere een financiële bijdrage kunnen aanbieden om de laatstgenoemde in staat te stellen werkzaamheden te realiseren die binnen haar bevoegdheid liggen maar van belang zijn voor de eerstgenoemde.  </sup> „Grensoverschrijdende” contracten van dit soort zijn niet noodzakelijkerwijze in alle landen toegestaan. Derhalve zal vaak eerst in een overeenkomst tussen Staten een regeling moeten worden getroffen in zake de mogelijkheid ertoe en inzake de voorwaarden voor gebruikmaking ervan (zie modelovereenkomst 1.4), Door het gebruik van een dergelijk contract, dat eenvoudig genoeg op te stellen en uit te voeren is, zou in sommige gevallen de oprichting van een gemeenschappelijke organisatie van het soort „Grensoverschrijdend intergemeentelijk samenwerkingsverband” (zie 2.6) dat andere juridische problemen doet rijzen, kunnen worden vermeden. 
### *Contractuele bepalingen* 

Wanneer het contract de oprichting of het beheer van openbaar eigendom, een openbare dienst of openbare voorziening van een lokale autoriteit in althans een van de landen betreft, moeten contractuele waarborgen worden gegeven overeenkomstig de regels die in het betrokken land of de betrokken landen gelden. Het contract verwijst tevens, waar nodig, naar de onderstaande specifieke voorwaarden: 

1. de voorschriften inzake de oprichting of het functioneren van de betrokken voorziening of dienst (b.v. dienstregeling, tarieven, voorwaarden voor gebruik, enz.);  

2. bijzondere voorwaarden inzake de oprichting van de voorziening of dienst (bijv. vereiste vergunningen, procedure, enz.;  

3. het programma van de voorziening of dienst;  

4. de procedure voor aanpassing van het contract om redenen van openbaar belang en de daaruit voortvloeiende financiële schadevergoedingen;  

5. de betrekkingen tussen de gebruikers van de voorziening of dienst en de exploitant (b.v. voorwaarden voor toegang, periodieke betalingen, enz.);  

6. de terugtrekking uit, de overname of de beëindiging van het contract.   Behalve deze bijzondere voorwaarden zijn tevens de bepalingen, aangegeven in het „privaatrechtelijke” modelcontract 2.4, van toepassing.  

### 2.6  

####Kaderovereenkomst inzake de instelling van organisaties voor intergemeentelijke grensoverschrijdende samenwerking

*Inleidende opmerking:* Er wordt van uitgegaan dat verscheidene lokale autoriteiten samen een organisatie met rechtspersoonlijkheid in het leven kunnen roepen ten einde een openbaar nutsbedrijf, een openbare dienst of een openbare voorziening te verschaffen en te exploiteren. De oprichting en het functioneren van zulk een vereniging of samenwerkingsverband zal voornamelijk afhangen van de toepasselijke wetgeving en de bepalingen van een voorafgaande overeenkomst tussen Staten waarbij deze vorm van samenwerking wordt toegestaan (zie modelovereenkomst 1.5). Onderstaand een lijst van de bepalingen die in de statuten dienen te worden opgenomen, voor zover zij niet zijn neergelegd in de toepasselijke wet. De statuten dienen onder meer te vermelden: 

1. de namen van de leden-oprichters van de vereniging en de voorwaarden waarop nieuwe leden kunnen toetreden;  

2. de naam, de zetel, de duur en de rechtsvorm van de vereniging (met verwijzing naar de wet die rechtspersoonlijkheid verleent);  

3. het doel van de vereniging, de wijze waarop dit wordt nagestreefd en de middelen waarover de vereniging kan beschikken;  

4. de wijze waarop het maatschappelijk kapitaal wordt gevormd;  

5. de reikwijdte en de grenzen van de aansprakelijkheid van de leden;  

6. de procedure voor de benoeming en het ontslag van bestuurders of beheerders van de vereniging, alsmede hun bevoegdheden;  

7. de betrekkingen van de vereniging met haar leden, derden en hogere autoriteiten, vooral wat de mededeling van begrotingen, balansen en rekeningen betreft;  

8. de personen die zijn belast met de financiële en technische controle van de werkzaamheden van de vereniging en de rapporten betreffende zulke controles;  

9. de voorwaarden voor wijziging van de statuten en voor de ontbinding van de vereniging;  

10. de voor het personeel geldende regels;  

11. de voor het taalgebruik geldende regels.
