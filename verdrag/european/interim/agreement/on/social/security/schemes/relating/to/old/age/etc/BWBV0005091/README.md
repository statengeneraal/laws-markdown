De Regeringen welke deze Overeenkomst hebben ondertekend, Leden van de Raad van Europa, Overwegende dat het doel van de Raad van Europa is grotere eenheid onder zijn Leden te bewerkstelligen, teneinde onder meer hun sociale vooruitgang te bevorderen, Bevestigende het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling van de onderdanen van alle Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst met betrekking tot de wetten en regelingen van ieder van Haar inzake de uitkeringen wegens ouderdom of invaliditeit of aan nabestaanden, welk beginsel is vastgelegd in de Verdragen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, Eveneens bevestigende het beginsel, krachtens hetwelk de onderdanen van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de voordelen moeten genieten van de overeenkomsten inzake de uitkeringen wegens ouderdom of invaliditeit of aan nabestaanden, gesloten tussen twee of meer van Haar, Verlangende aan deze beginselen uitvoering te geven door het sluiten van een Interim-Overeenkomst, in afwachting van het sluiten van een algemeen verdrag, gegrond op een netwerk van bilaterale overeenkomsten,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op alle wetten en regelingen inzake de sociale zekerheid, welke op het tijdstip van haar ondertekening van kracht zijn dan wel op een later tijdstip van kracht worden op enig deel van het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en welke betrekking hebben op:

### Artikel  2  

1.  Met inachtneming van het bepaalde in artikel 9 genieten de onderdanen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de voordelen van de wetten en regelingen van elke andere Partij, onder dezelfde voorwaarden als de onderdanen van laatstgenoemde: 

(a) ten aanzien van de uitkeringen bij invaliditeit op grond van een stelsel met of zonder premiebetaling, mits zij hun gewone verblijfplaats hadden gevestigd binnen het grondgebied van laatstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voordat de ziekte, welke de oorzaak is van de invaliditeit, voor de eerste maal medisch is vastgesteld;  

(b) ten aanzien van de uitkeringen, welke niet op premiebetaling berusten, mits zij sedert het bereiken van de twintigjarige leeftijd in het geheel gedurende tenminste vijftien jaren binnen dat grondgebied gewoond hebben, er op het tijdstip van de aanvrage om uitkering sedert tenminste vijf jaren zonder onderbreking hun gewone verblijfplaats hebben en er hun gewone verblijfplaats blijven houden;  

(c) ten aanzien van de uitkeringen, welke berusten op premiebetaling, mits zij verblijven binnen het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.     
2.

### Artikel  3  

1.  Elke overeenkomst met betrekking tot de wetten en regelingen bedoeld in artikel 1, welke gesloten is of gesloten zal worden tussen twee of meer Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, is met inachtneming van het bepaalde in artikel 9 van toepassing op een onderdaan van elke andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij alsof hij onderdaan was van één van eerstgenoemde Partijen, voor zover bedoelde overeenkomst ten aanzien van die wetten en regelingen bepalingen bevat ten aanzien van:
