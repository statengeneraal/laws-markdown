C.  Elk lid stelt de Organisatie in kennis van de hoeveelheden, de vorm en de samenstelling van de splijtstoffen, basismaterialen en andere materialen welke dat lid, overeenkomstig de bij dat lid geldende wetten, bereid is onmiddellijk of gedurende een door de Raad van Beheer vastgesteld tijdvak beschikbaar te stellen.   
D.  Op verzoek van de Organisatie dient een lid dat materiaal beschikbaar heeft gesteld hiervan onverwijld aan een ander lid of een groep van leden die hoeveelheden en die materialen te leveren als door de Organisatie wordt bepaald, en dient eveneens onverwijld aan de Organisatie zelf die hoeveelheden van die materialen te leveren, welke voor werkzaamheden alsmede wetenschappelijk onderzoek in de installaties van de Organisatie strikt noodzakelijk zijn.   
E.  De hoeveelheden, de vorm en de samenstelling van de door een lid beschikbaar gestelde materialen kunnen te allen tijde door het lid worden gewijzigd met goedkeuring van de Raad van Beheer.

Latere kennisgevingen hebben eveneens, indien de Raad van Beheer niet anders heeft beslist, betrekking op het tijdvak van het kalenderjaar dat volgt op de kennisgeving en worden niet later gedaan dan de eerste november van elk jaar.   
G.  De Organisatie bepaalt de plaats en wijze van levering en, indien nodig, de vorm en samenstelling van de materialen welke op verzoek van de Organisatie worden geleverd door een lid uit de hoeveelheden welke dat lid, blijkens een desbetreffende kennisgeving aan de Organisatie, bereid is beschikbaar te stellen. De Organisatie controleert eveneens de hoeveelheden geleverde materialen en brengt over deze hoeveelheden periodiek aan de leden verslag uit.   
H.  De Organisatie is verantwoordelijk voor het opslaan en beschermen der zich in zijn bezit bevindende materialen. De Organisatie draagt er zorg voor dat deze materialen worden beschermd tegen (1) de gevaarlijke inwerkingen van het weer, (2) wegneming door onbevoegden of een ander gebruik dan waarvoor zij bedoeld zijn, (3) beschadiging of vernietiging, sabotage inbegrepen, (4) beslaglegging. Bij het opslaan van de zich in haar bezit bevindende splijtstoffen draagt de Organisatie er zorg voor dat deze materialen geografisch zodanig verspreid zijn dat geen opeenhoping van grote hoeveelheden van deze materialen ontstaat in een bepaald land of in een bepaald gebied.   
I.  De Organisatie dient zodra zulks uitvoerbaar is van het volgende, voorzover nodig, te betrekken: 

1. apparatuur, uitrusting en installaties voor het ontvangen, opslaan en afgeven der materialen;  

2. materiële beveiligingen;  

3. afdoende maatregelen ter handhaving van gezondheid en veiligheid;  

4. controle-laboratoria voor de analyse en verificatie van de ontvangen materialen;  

5. huisvesting en administratie ten behoeve van het in verband met het bovenstaande benodigde personeel.     
J.  De ingevolge dit artikel beschikbaar gestelde materialen worden gebruikt op de door de Raad van Beheer overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Statuut vastgestelde wijze. Geen der leden heeft het recht te eisen dat de materialen welke het aan de Organisatie beschikbaar stelt door de Organisatie gescheiden worden gehouden of het project aan te wijzen waarin zij moeten worden gebruikt.

A.  Elk lid of elke groep leden van de Organisatie, welke een project voor onderzoek op het gebied van, of ontwikkeling of praktische toepassing van de atoomenergie voor vreedzame doeleinden wenst te ondernemen, kan ter verkrijging van splijtstoffen en andere materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties welke voor dit doel nodig zijn, de bemiddeling van de Organisatie inroepen. Elk zodanig verzoek dient te worden vergezeld van een toelichting van het doel en de omvang van het project en zal door de Raad van Beheer worden bestudeerd.   
B.  Op verzoek kan de Organisatie eveneens steun verlenen aan een lid of aan een groep van leden bij het treffen van regelingen teneinde de nodige financiële middelen van buitenaf te verkrijgen ter verwezenlijking van dergelijke projecten.

C.  De Organisatie kan regelingen treffen voor het leveren door een of meer leden van alle materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties welke voor het project nodig zijn of kan zich verplichten enige of alle der bovengenoemde materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties zelf rechtstreeks te verschaffen, daarbij rekening houdend met de wensen van het lid of de leden van wie het verzoek afkomstig is.   
D.  Teneinde het verzoek in behandeling te kunnen nemen kan de Organisatie een persoon of personen, bevoegd het project te onderzoeken, naar het grondgebied zenden van het lid of de groep leden van wie het verzoek afkomstig is. Voor dit doel kan de Organisatie, met toestemming van het lid of de groep leden van wie het verzoek afkomstig is, leden van haar eigen personeel gebruiken of onderdanen van ieder lid, die de daarvoor vereiste bevoegdheden bezitten.   
E.  Alvorens zijn goedkeuring te hechten aan een krachtens dit artikel ondernomen project, overtuigt de Raad van Beheer zich van: 

1. het nut van het project, met inbegrip van zijn wetenschappelijke en technische uitvoerbaarheid;  

2. De geschiktheid van de opzet van het project, de toereikendheid der fondsen, en de geschiktheid van het technisch personeel, om een doeltreffende uitvoering van het project te verzekeren;  

3. de doeltreffendheid der voorgestelde gezondheids- en veiligheidsnormen voor het behandelen en opslaan van materialen en voor het doen functioneren van installaties;  

4. het onvermogen van het lid of de groep leden van wie het verzoek afkomstig is om de nodige fondsen, materialen, installaties, uitrusting en diensten te verkrijgen;  

5. de rechtvaardige verdeling van materialen en andere voor de Organisatie beschikbare hulpbronnen;  

6. de bijzondere behoeften der onderontwikkelde gebieden; alsmede

2. de overdracht wordt geregeld van splijtstoffen van de plaats waar zij op dat ogenblik worden bewaard, ongeacht of de materialen berusten bij de Organisatie of bij het lid dat ze beschikbaar stelt, om te worden gebruikt voor projecten van de Organisatie, naar het lid dat of de groep leden die het voorstel tot het project heeft ingediend, op een wijze welke de veiligheid van elke vereiste zending waarborgt en voldoet aan de van toepassing zijnde gezondheids- en veiligheidsnormen;  

3. de voorwaarden, met inbegrip van de kosten, zijn opgenomen, waarop de materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties door de Organisatie zelf moeten worden verschaft en, indien deze materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties door een lid moeten worden verschaft, de voorwaarden welke worden overeengekomen tussen het lid dat of de groep leden die het voorstel tot het project hebben ingediend en het lid dat voor de levering zorgt;  

4. de belofte is vervat van het lid of de groep welke het voorstel tot het project indient (*a*) dat de verleende steun niet zal worden gebruikt op een zodanige wijze dat daarmede enig militair doel wordt gediend; en (*b*) dat het project wordt onderworpen aan de in artikel XII voorziene waarborgen, waarbij de voor elk speciaal geval geldende veiligheidsvoorschriften in de overeenkomst worden omschreven;  

5. de nodige voorzieningen zijn opgenomen inzake de rechten en belangen van de Organisatie en van het lid of de leden betrokken bij eventuele uit het project voortkomende uitvindingen of ontdekkingen of eventuele patenten daarop,  

6. de nodige voorzieningen zijn opgenomen inzake het bijleggen van geschillen;

### Artikel  XII  

####Waarborgen van de Organisatie

A.  Met betrekking tot elk project van de Organisatie of tot een andere regeling waarbij de Organisatie door de betrokken partijen wordt verzocht veiligheidsvoorschriften toe te passen, heeft de Organisatie de volgende rechten en verantwoordelijkheden ten opzichte van het project of de regeling: 

1. de ontwerpen voor bijzondere uitrusting en installaties, kernreactoren inbegrepen, aan een onderzoek te onderwerpen en het al of niet verlenen van goedkeuring uitsluitend te baseren op de vraag of vaststaat dat daarmede geen militaire doeleinden zullen worden gediend, dat zij voldoen aan de geldende gezondheids- en veiligheidsnormen en dat zij een doeltreffende toepassing van de in dit artikel voorziene waarborgen mogelijk maken;  

2. de naleving te eisen van alle door de Organisatie voorgeschreven maatregelen ter bescherming van de gezondheid en de veiligheid;  

3. te eisen dat werkstaten worden bijgehouden en overgelegd om aldus het doeltreffend afleggen van verantwoording ten aanzien van bij het project of de regeling gebruikte of geproduceerde basismaterialen of splijtstoffen te vergemakkelijken;  

4. rapporten over de vorderingen der werkzaamheden te eisen;  

5. goedkeuring te hechten aan de voor de chemische regeneratie van bestraalde materialen aan te wenden middelen, uitsluitend om te verzekeren dat deze chemische regeneratie er niet toe zal leiden dat de materialen aan hun oorspronkelijke bestemming kunnen worden onttrokken om voor militaire doeleinden te worden gebruikt en dat zij aan de geldende gezondheids- en veiligheidsnormen voldoen; te eisen dat splijtstoffen welke zijn verkregen of geproduceerd als bijprodukt onder voortdurende toepassing van de waarborgen van de Organisatie voor vreedzame doeleinden worden gebruikt, hetzij voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek hetzij in door het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden aangewezen reeds bestaande of in aanbouw zijnde reactoren; en het in bewaring geven bij de Organisatie te eisen van elke hoeveelheid als bijprodukt verkregen of geproduceerde splijtstoffen welke uitgaat boven hetgeen voor het bovenvermelde gebruik nodig is teneinde voorraadvorming van deze materialen te voorkomen, mits daarna de op deze wijze bij de Organisatie in bewaring gegeven splijtstoffen op verzoek van het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden onmiddellijk aan het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden worden teruggegeven om met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde bepalingen te worden aangewend;  

6. naar het gebied van de ontvangende Staat of Staten inspecteurs te zenden, aangewezen door de Organisatie in overleg met de betrokken Staat of Staten, die te allen tijde toegang dienen te hebben tot alle plaatsen en gegevens, alsmede tot elke persoon die uit hoofde van zijn beroep te maken heeft met materialen, uitrusting of installaties welke krachtens dit Statuut aan veiligheidsvoorschriften onderworpen dienen te zijn, voor zover zulks nodig is voor het afleggen van verantwoording voor geleverde basis-materialen en splijtstoffen en voor geproduceerde splijtstoffen en om na te gaan of de belofte om deze niet ten behoeve van enig militair doel, zoals bedoeld in artikel XI, lid F sub 4, te gebruiken, wordt nageleefd, alsmede of wordt voldaan aan de in lid A sub 2 van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen ter bescherming der gezondheid en veiligheid en aan alle andere in de overeenkomst tussen de Organisatie en de betrokken Staat of Staten voorbeschreven voorwaarden. De door de Organisatie aangewezen inspecteurs zullen, op verzoek van de betrokken Staat, worden vergezeld door vertegenwoordigers van de autoriteiten van die Staat, mits de inspecteurs hierdoor niet bij de uitoefening van hun werkzaamheden vertraging ondervinden of anderszins daarin worden belemmerd;  

7. de hulpverlening op te schorten of te beëindigen en alle door de Organisatie of door een lid ter bevordering van het project beschikbaar gestelde materialen en uitrusting terug te nemen, indien de ontvangende Staat of Staten verzuimt/verzuimen de voorschriften na te leven of niet binnen redelijke tijd de gevraagde maatregelen neemt/nemen ter correctie van de situatie.     
B.  De Organisatie stelt naar behoefte een inspectie-apparaat in. De inspecteurs hebben tot taak alle door de Organisatie zelf verrichte werkzaamheden te onderzoeken teneinde na te gaan of de Organisatie zich houdt aan de maatregelen ter bescherming van de gezondheid en de veiligheid welke zijzelf heeft opgesteld inzake de projecten welke aan haar goedkeuring, toezicht of controle zijn onderworpen, alsmede of de Organisatie afdoende maatregelen neemt om te verhinderen dat de bij haar berustende of door haar voor eigen werkzaamheden benutte basismaterialen en splijtstoffen en de splijtstoffen die daarbij werden geproduceerd, gebruikt worden ten dienste van enig militair doel. De Organisatie neemt onmiddellijk maatregelen om elke niet-naleving of elk verzuim afdoende maatregelen te nemen, te corrigeren.   
C.  Het inspectie-apparaat heeft eveneens tot taak er voor te zorgen dat de in lid A sub 6 van dit artikel bedoelde verantwoording inderdaad wordt afgelegd, alsmede deze aan controle te onderwerpen en na te gaan of de in artikel XI, lid F sub 4 bedoelde belofte wordt nageleefd, of aan de in lid A sub 2 van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen de hand wordt gehouden en of aan alle andere in de overeenkomst tussen de Organisatie en de betrokken Staat of de betrokken Staten voorgeschreven voorwaarden met betrekking tot het project wordt voldaan. De inspecteurs rapporteren elk geval van niet-naleving aan de Directeur-Generaal, die vervolgens het rapport aan de Raad van Beheer doorgeeft. De Raad van Beheer nodigt de ontvangende Staat of Staten uit onmiddellijk elke niet-naleving die hij aldus heeft geconstateerd te corrigeren. De Raad rapporteert de niet-naleving aan alle leden, alsmede aan de Veiligheidsraad en de Algemene Vergadering der Verenigde Naties. Bij verzuim door de ontvangende Staat of Staten om binnen redelijke tijd alle maatregelen te nemen, welke nodig zijn ter correctie van de situatie kan de Raad een der volgende of beide volgende maatregelen riemen: onmiddellijke besnoeiing of opschorting der door de Organisatie of door een lid verleende bijstand en teruggave eisen der aan een ontvangend lid of aan een groep ontvangende leden beschikbaar gestelde materialen en uitrusting. De Organisatie kan eveneens, overeenkomstig artikel XIX, elk lid dat zich niet aan de naleving der voorschriften houdt, tijdelijk van de rechten en voorrechten van het lidmaatschap ontheffen.   

### Artikel  XIII  

####Vergoeding aan leden

Tenzij tussen de Raad van Beheer en het lid dat aan de Organisatie materialen, diensten, uitrusting of installaties verschaft anderszins is overeengekomen, gaat de Raad met dat lid een overeenkomst aan ter vergoeding van het geleverde.  

### Artikel  XIV  

####Financiën

A.  De Raad van Beheer dient bij de Algemene Conferentie de jaarlijkse begroting voor de uitgaven van de Organisatie in. Ten einde in deze het werk van de Raad van Beheer te vergemakkelijken wordt de begroting in eerste instantie door de Directeur-Generaal opgesteld. Indien de Algemene Conferentie de begroting niet goedkeurt, zendt zij deze vergezeld van haar aanbevelingen aan de Raad van Beheer terug. De Raad van Beheer dient daarna wederom een begroting bij de Algemene Conferentie ter goedkeuring in.   
B.  De uitgaven van de Organisatie worden als volgt ingedeeld: 

1. Uitgaven betreffende de administratie: deze omvatten 

(a) kosten in Verband met het personeel van de Organisatie dat niet behoort tot het personeel dat de zorg heeft voor de materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties als bedoeld in lid B sub 2 hieronder; kosten in verband met vergaderingen, alsmede uitgaven welke nodig zijn voor het voorbereiden van projecten van de Organisatie en voor de verspreiding van gegevens;  

(b) kosten voor de toepassing van de in artikel XII in verband mei projecten van de Organisatie bedoelde waarborgen of, krachtens artikel III, lid A sub 5, kosten in verband met elke bilaterale of multilaterale regeling, alsmede de kosten voor het hanteren en opslaan van splijtstoffen door de Organisatie, met uitzondering van de kosten voor het hanteren en opslaan als bedoeld in het hiernavolgende lid E;    

2. Uitgaven welke niet behoren tot de uitgaven bedoeld sub 1 van dit lid, gedaan in verband met materialen, installaties, apparatuur en uitrusting welke zijn verworven of opgericht door de Organisatie bij de uitoefening van de functies waartoe zij gemachtigd is, alsmede de kosten van materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties door de Organisatie geleverd krachtens overeenkomsten met een of meer leden.     
C.  Bij het vaststellen van de uitgaven krachtens lid B sub 1 (*b*) hierboven, brengt de Raad van Beheer die bedragen in mindering welke krachtens overeenkomsten tussen de Organisatie en partijen bij bilaterale of multilaterale regelingen betreffende de toepassing van waarborgen verhaalbaar zijn.   
D.  De Raad van Beheer slaat de in lid B sub 1 hierboven bedoelde uitgaven onder de leden om, volgens een door de Algemene Conferentie vast te stellen schaal. Bij het vaststellen van de schaal laat de Algemene Conferentie zich leiden door de door de Verenigde Naties aanvaarde beginselen met betrekking tot het vaststellen der bijdragen van de Staten Leden tot de gewone begroting der Verenigde Naties.   
E.  De Raad van Beheer stelt periodiek kostentarieven vast, hierbij inbegrepen redelijke en uniforme kosten voor opslaan en behandeling voor door de Organisatie aan de leden geleverde materialen, diensten, uitrusting en installaties. De tarieven worden zodanig berekend dat de Organisatie inkomsten verwerft welke voldoende zijn om de in lid B sub 2 bedoelde kosten en uitgaven, verminderd met eventuele vrijwillige bijdragen welke de Raad van Beheer overeenkomstig lid F voor dit doel kan leveren, te dekken. De opbrengst van deze kosten wordt in een afzonderlijk fonds gestort, dat zal worden aangewend om de leden te betalen voor alle door hen geleverde materialen, diensten, uitrusting of installaties en teneinde andere in lid B sub 2 hierboven bedoelde kosten welke eventueel door de Organisatie zelf worden gemaakt, te dekken.   
F.  Alle bedragen welke van de in lid E bedoelde inkomsten overblijven, nadat de in dat lid bedoelde uitgaven en kosten bestreden zijn, alsmede alle vrijwillig aan de Organisatie geleverde bijdragen, worden in een algemeen fonds gestort, dat kan worden aangewend op een door de Raad van Beheer met goedkeuring van de Algemene Conferentie, te bepalen wijze.   
G.  Behoudens de door de Algemene Conferentie goedgekeurde regelingen en beperkingen, is de Raad van Beheer bevoegd leningen aan te gaan ten behoeve van de Organisatie zonder dat dit evenwel voor de leden van de Organisatie enige aansprakelijkheid medebrengt met betrekking tot krachtens deze bevoegdheid aangegane leningen, alsmede vrijwillige bijdragen aan de Organisatie te aanvaarden.   
H.  De beslissingen van de Algemene Conferentie inzake financiële aangelegenheden en van de Raad van Beheer inzake het bedrag der begroting van de Organisatie worden genomen met een tweederde meerderheid der aanwezige, hun stem uitbrengende leden.   

### Artikel  XV  

####Voorrechten en immuniteiten

A.  De Organisatie bezit op het grondgebied van elk lid die rechtsbevoegdheid en geniet die voorrechten en immuniteiten welke voor de uitoefening van haar functies nodig zijn.   
B.  De afgevaardigden der leden, alsmede hun plaatsvervangers en adviseurs, leden van de Raad van Beheer, alsmede hun plaatsvervangers en adviseurs, de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel van de Organisatie genieten die voorrechten en immuniteiten welke nodig zijn voor de zelfstandige uitoefening van hun functies in verband met de Organisatie.   
C.  De in dit artikel bedoelde rechtsbevoegdheid, voorrechten en immuniteiten zullen in een afzonderlijke overeenkomst of overeenkomsten tussen de Organisatie, in deze vertegenwoordigd door de Directeur-Generaal optredend op last van de Raad van Beheer, en de leden, worden omschreven.   

### Artikel  XVI  

####De betrekkingen met andere organisaties

A.  De Raad van Beheer is, met goedkeuring van de Algemene Conferentie, bevoegd een overeenkomst of overeenkomsten aan te gaan tot regeling van de betrekkingen tussen de Organisatie en de Verenigde Naties en alle andere organisaties waarvan de werkzaamheden verband houden met die van de Organisatie.   
B.  De overeenkomst of overeenkomsten tot regeling van de betrekkingen tussen de Organisatie en de Verenigde Naties zullen voorzien in: 

1. Indiening door de Organisatie van de in lid B van artikel III sub 4 en 5 voorziene rapporten;  

2. Overweging door de Organisatie van op haar betrekking hebbende resoluties welke door de Algemene Vergadering of door een of meer der Raden van de Verenigde Naties zijn aanvaard en de indiening, wanneer daartoe het verzoek wordt gedaan, van rapporten aan het daarvoor aangewezen orgaan van de Verenigde Naties inzake de stappen door de Organisatie of haar leden genomen overeenkomstig dit Statuut als gevolg van bovenbedoelde overweging.     

### Artikel  XVII  

####Regeling van geschillen

A.  Elk vraagpunt of geschil betreffende de interpretatie of toepassing van dit Statuut dat niet door onderhandeling wordt geregeld, wordt verwezen naar het Internationale Gerechtshof overeenkomstig het Statuut van dit Hof, tenzij de betrokken partijen overeenstemming bereiken over een andere wijze van regeling.   
B.  De Algemene Conferentie en de Raad van Beheer hebben beiden afzonderlijk de bevoegdheid, behoudens machtiging van de Algemene Vergadering der Verenigde Naties, het Internationale Gerechtshof te verzoeken advies te geven over alle juridische vraagstukken welke zich binnen het kader van de werkzaamheden van de Organisatie kunnen voordoen.   

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Wijzigingen en uittredingen

A.  Elk lid mag voorstellen doen tot het aanbrengen van wijzigingen in dit Statuut. De Directeur-Generaal verzorgt de gewaarmerkte afschriften van de tekst van elke voorgestelde wijziging en zendt deze tekst tenminste negentig dagen voordat hij door de Algemene Conferentie zal worden bestudeerd, ter kennisneming aan alle leden toe.   
B.  Op de vijfde jaarlijkse zitting van de Algemene Conferentie, welke volgt op het inwerkingtreden van dit Statuut, zal het vraagstuk van een algemene herziening van de bepalingen van dit Statuut op de agenda van die zitting worden geplaatst. Indien een enkelvoudige meerderheid der aanwezige, hun stem uitbrengende leden daaraan haar goedkeuring hecht, worden de bepalingen van dit Statuut tijdens de navolgende Algemene Conferentie opnieuw in beschouwing genomen. Hierna kunnen, krachtens dezelfde procedure, voorstellen inzake de kwestie van een algemene herziening van dit Statuut worden ingediend ter beoordeling door de Algemene Conferentie.   
C.  De wijzigingen worden ten aanzien van alle leden van kracht indien zij 

(i) door de Algemene Conferentie met een tweederde meerderheid der hun stem uitbrengende aanwezigen goedgekeurd zijn, nadat de door de Raad van Beheer ten aanzien van elke voorgestelde wijziging ingediende opmerkingen zijn bestudeerd;  

(ii) door tweederde van alle leden overeenkomstig hun onderscheidene grondwettelijke procedures zijn aanvaard. Aanvaarding door een lid vindt plaats door middel van nederlegging van een akte van aanvaarding bij de in lid C van artikel XXI bedoelde depot-Regering.     
D.  Op ieder ogenblik na de datum waarop het vijf jaar geleden zal zijn dat dit Statuut overeenkomstig lid E van artikel XXI voor het eerst in werking trad of te allen tijde wanneer een lid niet bereid is een in dit Statuut aangebrachte wijziging te aanvaarden, kan een lid uit de Organisatie treden door middel van een schriftelijke daartoe strekkende kennisgeving aan de in lid C van artikel XXI bedoelde depot-Regering, welke de Raad van Beheer en alle leden onmiddellijk hiervan in kennis stelt.   
E.  Uittreding door een lid uit de Organisatie heeft geen invloed op zijn krachtens artikel XI aangegane contractuele verplichtingen of op zijn financiële verplichtingen voor het jaar waarin het zich terugtrekt.   

### Artikel  XIX  

####Tijdelijk vervallen der voorrechten

A.  Een lid van de Organisatie dat achterstallig is in de betaling van zijn financiële bijdragen aan de Organisatie heeft geen stem meer in de Organisatie indien het bedrag van zijn achterstallige betalingen gelijk is aan het bedrag der over de twee afgelopen jaren door het lid verschuldigde bijdragen of dit overtreft. De Algemene Conferentie kan evenwel zulk een lid toch toestemming verlenen te stemmen indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het niet voldoen door het lid aan zijn financiële verplichtingen een gevolg is van omstandigheden waarop het lid zelf geen invloed kan uitoefenen.   
B.  Een lid dat de bepalingen van dit Statuut of van enigerlei door dat lid krachtens dit Statuut aangegane overeenkomst bij herhaling geschonden heeft kan door de Algemene Conferentie, handelend met tweederde meerderheid der aanwezige, hun stem uitbrengende leden, op aanbeveling van de Raad van Beheer tijdelijk van de rechten en voorrechten van het lidmaatschap worden ontheven.
