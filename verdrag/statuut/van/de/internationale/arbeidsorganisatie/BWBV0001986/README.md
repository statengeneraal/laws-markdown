##Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie

####Constitution of the International Labour Organisation

PREAMBLE Whereas universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice; And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those conditions is urgently required: as, for example, by the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value, recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organisation of vocational and technical education and other measures; Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries; The High Contracting Parties, moved by sentiments of justice and humanity as well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world, and with a view to attaining the objectives set forth in this Preamble, agree to the following Constitution of the International Labour Organisation:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####Organisation

### Article  1  

1.  A permanent organisation is hereby established for the promotion of the objects set forth in the Preamble to this Constitution and in the Declaration concerning the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation adopted at Philadelphia on 10 May 1944 the text of which is annexed to this Constitution.   
2.  The Members of the International Labour Organisation shall be the States which were Members of the Organisation on 1 November 1945, and such other States as may become Members in pursuance of the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article.   
3.  Any original Member of the United Nations and any State admitted to membership of the United Nations by a decision of the General Assembly in accordance with the provisions of the Charter may become a Member of the International Labour Organisation by communicating to the Director-General of the International Labour Office its formal acceptance of the obligations of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.   
4.  The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation may also admit Members to the Organisation by a vote concurred in by two-thirds of the delegates attending the session, including two-thirds of the Government delegates present and voting. Such admission shall take effect on the communication to the Director-General of the International Labour Office by the government of the new Member of its formal acceptance of the obligations of the Constitution of the Organisation.   
5.  No Member of the International Labour Organisation may withdraw from the Organisation without giving notice of its intention so to do to the Director-General of the International Labour Office. Such notice shall take effect two years after the date of its reception by the Director-General, subject to the Member having at that time fulfilled all financial obligations arising out of its membership. When a Member has ratified any international labour Convention, such withdrawal shall not affect the continued validity for the period provided for in the Convention of all obligations arising thereunder or relating thereto.   
6.  In the event of any State having ceased to be a Member of the Organisation, its readmission to membership shall be governed by the provisions of paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this article as the case may be.   

### Article  2  

The permanent organisation shall consist of - 

(a) a General Conference of representatives of the Members;  

(b) a Governing Body composed as described in article 7; and  

(c) an International Labour Office controlled by the Governing Body.    

### Article  3  

1.  The meetings of the General Conference of representatives of the Members shall be held from time to time as occasion may require, and at least once in every year.

(b) persons nominated by it to advise its delegates in regard to matters concerning non-self-governing territories.

### Article  4  

1.  Every delegate shall be entitled to vote individually on all matters which are taken into consideration by the Conference.

7.  In the case of a federal State, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) in respect of Conventions and Recommendations which the federal government regards as appropriate under its constitutional system for federal action, the obligations of the federal State shall be the same as those of Members which are not federal States;  

(b) in respect of Conventions and Recommendations which the federal government regards as appropriate under its constitutional system, in whole or in part, for action by the constituent states, provinces, or cantons rather than for federal action, the federal government shall - 

(i) make, in accordance with its Constitution and the Constitutions of the states, provinces or cantons concerned, effective arrangements for the reference of such Conventions and Recommendations not later than 18 months from the closing of the session of the Conference to the appropriate federal, state, provincial or cantonal authorities for the enactment of legislation or other action;

8.  In no case shall the adoption of any Convention or Recommendation by the Conference, or the ratification of any Convention by any Member, be deemed to affect any law, award, custom or agreement which ensures more favourable conditions to the workers concerned than those provided for in the Convention or Recommendation.   

### Article  20  

Any Convention so ratified shall be communicated by the Director-General of the International Labour Office to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with the provisions of article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations but shall only be binding upon the Members which ratify it.

1.  If any Convention coming before the Conference for final consideration fails to secure the support of two-thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present, it shall nevertheless be within the right of any of the Members of the Organisation to agree to such Convention among themselves.   
2.  Any Convention so agreed to shall be communicated by the governments concerned to the Director-General of the International Labour Office and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with the provisions of article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations.

### Article  25  

If no statement is received within a reasonable time from the government in question, or if the statement when received is not deemed to be satisfactory by the Governing Body, the latter shall have the right to publish the representation and the statement, if any, made in reply to it.  

### Article  26  

1.  Any of the Members shall have the right to file a complaint with the International Labour Office if it is not satisfied that any other Member is securing the effective observance of any Convention which both have ratified in accordance with the foregoing articles.   
2.  The Governing Body may, if it thinks fit, before referring such a complaint to a Commission of Inquiry, as hereinafter provided for, communicate with the government in question in the manner described in article 24.   
3.  If the Governing Body does not think it necessary to communicate the complaint to the government in question, or if, when it has made such communication, no statement in reply has been received within a reasonable time which the Governing Body considers to be satisfactory, the Governing Body may appoint a Commission of Inquiry to consider the complaint and to report thereon.

2.  Each Member which ratifies a Convention shall as soon as possible after ratification communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a declaration stating in respect of the territories other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 below the extent to which it undertakes that the provisions of the Convention shall be applied and giving such particulars as may be prescribed by the Convention.

6.  Acceptance of the obligations of a Convention in virtue of paragraph 4 or paragraph 5 shall involve the acceptance on behalf of the territory concerned of the obligations stipulated by the terms of the Convention and the obligations under the Constitution of the Organisation which apply to ratified Conventions. A declaration of acceptance may specify such modification of the provisions of the Conventions as may be necessary to adapt the Convention to local conditions.   
7.

### ANNEX  

####Declaration concerning the Aims and Purposes of the International Labour Organisation

The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, meeting in its Twenty-sixth Session in Philadelphia, hereby adopts, this tenth day of May in the year nineteen hundred and forty-four, the present Declaration of the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation and of the principles which should inspire the policy of its Members. 

I The Conference reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based and, in particular, that - 

(a) labour is not a commodity;  

(b) freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained progress;  

(c) poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere;  

(d) the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.    

II Believing that experience has fully demonstrated the truth of the statement in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice, the Conference affirms that - 

(a) all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity;  

(b) the attainment of the conditions in which this shall be possible must constitute the central aim of national and international policy;  

(c) all national and international policies and measures, in particular those of an economic and financial character, should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective;  

(d) it is a responsibility of the International Labour Organisation to examine and consider all international economic and financial policies and measures in the light of this fundamental objective;  

(e) in discharging the tasks entrusted to it the International Labour Organisation, having considered all relevant economic and financial factors, may include in its decisions and recommendations any provisions which it considers appropriate.    

III The Conference recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further among the nations of the world programmes which will achieve: 

(a) full employment and the raising of standards of living;  

(b) the employment of workers in the occupations in which they can have the satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill and attainments and make their greatest contribution to the common well-being;  

(c) the provision, as a means to the attainment of this end and under adequate guarantees for all concerned, of facilities for training and the transfer of labour, including migration for employment and settlement;  

(d) policies in regard to wages and earnings, hours and other conditions of work calculated to ensure a just share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all employed and in need of such protection;  

(e) the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the co-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the preparation and application of social and economic measures;  

(f) the extension of social security measures to provide a basic income to all in need of such protection and comprehensive medical care;  

(g) adequate protection for the life and health of workers in all occupations;  

(h) provision for child welfare and maternity protection;  

(i) the provision of adequate nutrition, housing and facilities for recreation and culture;  

(j) the assurance of equality of educational and vocational opportunity.    

IV Confident that the fuller and broader utilisation of the world's productive resources necessary for the achievement of the objectives set forth in this Declaration can be secured by effective international and national action, including measures to expand production and consumption, to avoid severe economic fluctuations, to promote the economic and social advancement of the less developed regions of the world, to assure greater stability in world prices of primary products, and to promote a high and steady volume of international trade, the Conference pledges the full co-operation of the International Labour Organisation with such international bodies as may be entrusted with a share of the responsibility for this great task and for the promotion of the health, education and well-being of all peoples.  

V The Conference affirms that the principles set forth in this Declaration are fully applicable to alle peoples everywhere and that, while the manner of their application must be determined with due regard to the stage of social and economic development reached by each people, their progressive application to peoples who are still dependent, as well as to those who have already achieved self-government, is a matter of concern to the whole civilised world.     

####Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie

PREAMBULE Aangezien een duurzame wereldvrede slechts kan worden gevestigd indien zij is gegrond op sociale rechtvaardigheid; Aangezien er arbeidsvoorwaarden bestaan die voor velen onrecht, leed en ontberingen met zich brengen, hetgeen aanleiding geeft tot een zodanige ontevredenheid dat daardoor de vrede en de eensgezindheid in de wereld in gevaar worden gebracht, en aangezien een verbetering van deze voorwaarden dringend noodzakelijk is: bijvoorbeeld door het vaststellen van arbeidstijden, met inbegrip van de maximale duur van de werkdag en de werkweek, het opstellen van regels voor de werving van werknemers, het bestrijden van de werkloosheid, het waarborgen van een loon dat redelijke bestaansvoorwaarden verzekert, het beschermen van de werknemers tegen ziekten van algemene aard of beroepsziekten en arbeidsongevallen, het beschermen van kinderen, jongeren en vrouwen, het instellen van ouderdoms- en invaliditeitsvoorzieningen, het beschermen van de belangen van in het buitenland werkzame werknemers, het erkennen van het beginsel van gelijk loon voor gelijke arbeid, het erkennen van het beginsel van vakverenigingsvrijheid, het organiseren van het beroepsonderwijs en het technische onderwijs alsmede het nemen van andere soortgelijke maatregelen; Aangezien het streven van de volken om het lot van de werknemers in hun eigen landen te verbeteren, zou worden belemmerd wanneer enige natie een werkelijk menswaardige arbeidsregeling niet zou aannemen; Hechten de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, evenzeer gedreven door gevoelens van gerechtigheid en menslievendheid als door het verlangen een duurzame wereldvrede te verzekeren, en met het oog op het bereiken van de in deze preambule genoemde doeleinden, hun goedkeuring aan het volgende Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Organisatie

### Artikel  1  

1.  Er wordt een permanente Organisatie opgericht die tot taak heeft te streven naar de verwezenlijking van het programma zoals dat is uiteengezet in de Preambule van dit Statuut en in de Verklaring nopens de doelstellingen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, welke Verklaring op 10 mei 1944 te Philadelphia is aangenomen en waarvan de tekst als bijlage aan dit Statuut is toegevoegd.   
2.  Leden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie zijn de Staten die op 1 november 1945 Lid van de Organisatie waren, en alle andere Staten die overeenkomstig het bepaalde in de leden 3 en 4 van dit artikel Lid worden.   
3.  Elk oorspronkelijk Lid der Verenigde Naties en elke Staat die bij beslissing van de Algemene Vergadering overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Handvest tot het Lidmaatschap der Verenigde Naties is toegelaten, kan Lid worden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie door de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationale Arbeidsbureau mededeling te doen van zijn officiële aanvaarding van de uit het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie voortvloeiende verplichtingen.   
4.  De Algemene Conferentie van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kan eveneens Leden tot de Organisatie toelaten met een meerderheid van twee derde van de ter zitting aanwezige afgevaardigden, waaronder twee derde van de aanwezige en stemmende regeringsafgevaardigden zijn begrepen. Deze toelating wordt van kracht wanneer de regering van het nieuwe Lid de Directeur van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau mededeling heeft gedaan van haar officiële aanvaarding van uit het Statuut van de Organisatie voortvloeiende verplichtingen.   
5.  Geen enkel Lid van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kan zich uit de Organisatie terugtrekken zonder de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau van zijn voornemen daartoe in kennis te hebben gesteld. Deze kennisgeving wordt van kracht twee jaar na de datum van ontvangst door de Directeur-Generaal, onder voorbehoud dat het Lid op die datum alle uit zijn lidmaatschap voortvloeiende financiële verplichtingen heeft vervuld. Wanneer een Lid een internationaal arbeidsverdrag heeft bekrachtigd, is deze terugtrekking niet van invloed op de voortduur, tijdens de door het Verdrag bedoelde periode, van de verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit of betrekking hebben op het Verdrag.   
6.  Ingeval een Staat heeft opgehouden Lid te zijn van de Organisatie, wordt zijn wedertoelating als Lid geregeld door het bepaalde in de leden 3 en 4 van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  2  

De permanente Organisatie omvat: 

a) een Algemene Conferentie van vertegenwoordigers der Leden;  

b) een Raad van Beheer, samengesteld als bepaald in artikel 7;  

c) een Internationaal Arbeidsbureau onder toezicht van de Raad van Beheer.    

### Artikel  3  

1.  De Algemene Conferentie van vertegenwoordigers der Leden komt bijeen telkens wanneer dit nodig is en ten minste eenmaal per jaar. Zij is samengesteld uit vier vertegenwoordigers van elk Lid, waaronder twee regeringsafgevaardigden en twee afgevaardigden die onderscheidenlijk de werkgevers en de werknemers van elk Lid vertegenwoordigen.   
2.  Iedere afgevaardigde kan worden vergezeld door ten hoogste twee adviseurs voor elk punt op de agenda van de zitting. Wanneer ter Conferentie vraagstukken in behandeling komen die in het bijzonder betrekking hebben op vrouwen, moet ten minste één van de adviseurs een vrouw zijn.   
3.  Ieder Lid dat verantwoordelijk is voor de buitenlandse betrekkingen van buiten het moederland gelegen gebieden, kan voor elke afgevaardigde bovendien als adviseurs aanwijzen: 

a) personen die door dat Lid zijn aangewezen als vertegenwoordigers van dat gebied voor vraagstukken die onder de bevoegdheden van de autoriteiten van dat gebied vallen;  

b) personen die door dat Lid zijn aangewezen om zijn afgevaardigden bij te staan bij vraagstukken betreffende gebieden die geen zelfbestuur hebben.     
4.  Indien het een gebied betreft dat onder het gemeenschappelijk gezag van twee of meer Leden is geplaatst, kunnen personen worden aangewezen om de afgevaardigden van deze Leden bij te staan.   
5.  De Leden verbinden zich de afgevaardigden en de adviseurs die niet hun regering vertegenwoordigen aan te wijzen in overeenstemming met de meest representatieve werkgevers- en werknemersorganisaties, indien deze in het betreffende land bestaan.   
6.  De adviseurs mogen alleen het woord voeren op verzoek van de afgevaardigde aan wie zij zijn toegevoegd en met bijzondere toestemming van de Voorzitter van de Conferentie; zij mogen niet aan de stemmingen deelnemen.   
7.  Een afgevaardigde kan, bij een aan de Voorzitter gerichte schriftelijke mededeling, een van zijn adviseurs als zijn plaatsvervanger aanwijzen en deze plaatsvervanger kan in die hoedanigheid aan de beraadslagingen en aan de stemmingen deelnemen.   
8.  De namen van de afgevaardigden en hun adviseurs worden door de regering van elk Lid aan het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau medegedeeld.   
9.  De geloofsbrieven van de afgevaardigden en van hun adviseurs worden onderzocht door de Conferentie die, bij een meerderheid van twee derde van de door de aanwezige Leden uitgebrachte stemmen, kan weigeren een afgevaardigde of een adviseur toe te laten die naar haar mening niet is aangewezen in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in dit artikel.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  Iedere afgevaardigde heeft het recht hoofdelijk te stemmen over alle aangelegenheden die door de Conferentie worden behandeld.   
2.  Indien een der Leden heeft nagelaten een der niet-regeringsafgevaardigden waarop dat Lid recht heeft, aan te wijzen, mag de andere niet-regeringsafgevaardigde aan de beraadslagingen van de Conferentie deelnemen, doch niet aan de stemmingen.   
3.  Indien de Conferentie op grond van het bepaalde in artikel 3 de toelating van een afgevaardigde van een der Leden weigert, wordt het bepaalde in dit artikel toegepast alsof die afgevaardigde niet was aangewezen.   

### Artikel  5  

De bijeenkomsten der Conferentie worden, behoudens een door de Conferentie zelf in een voorafgaande zitting genomen beslissing, gehouden in een door de Raad van Beheer aan te wijzen plaats.  

### Artikel  6  

De Conferentie beslist over verplaatsing van de zetel van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau met een meerderheid van twee derde van de door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  De Raad van Beheer is samengesteld uit 56 personen, namelijk: 28 vertegenwoordigers van regeringen, 14 vertegenwoordigers van werkgevers, en 14 vertegenwoordigers van werknemers.   
2.  Tien van de achtentwintig regeringsvertegenwoordigers worden aangewezen door de Leden die op het gebied van de industrie de belangrijkste plaatsen innemen, terwijl er achttien worden aangewezen door de Leden die daartoe zijn aangewezen door de regeringsafgevaardigden ter Conferentie, met uitzondering van de afgevaardigden van de tien bovengenoemde Leden.   
3.  De Raad van Beheer bepaalt, telkens wanneer dit nodig is, welke Leden op het gebied van de industrie de belangrijkste plaatsen innemen, en stelt regels vast ten einde te verzekeren dat alle aangelegenheden betreffende de aanwijzing van de Leden die op het gebied van de industrie de belangrijkste plaatsen innemen, door een onpartijdige commissie worden onderzocht, alvorens de Raad van Beheer hieromtrent een beslissing neemt. Over elk beroep van een Lid tegen het besluit van de Raad van Beheer waarbij deze heeft vastgesteld welke Leden op het gebied van de industrie de belangrijkste plaatsen innemen, wordt beslist door de Conferentie, doch het feit dat bij de Conferentie een beroep is ingesteld betekent niet dat, hangende dit beroep, de uitvoering van het besluit wordt opgeschort.   
4.  De personen die de werkgevers vertegenwoordigen en de personen die de werknemers vertegenwoordigen, worden onderscheidenlijk gekozen door de afgevaardigden van de werkgevers en de afgevaardigden van de werknemers op de Conferentie.   
5.  De zittingsduur van de Raad van Beheer is drie jaar. Indien de verkiezingen voor de Raad van Beheer, om welke reden dan ook, niet plaatsvinden voor het verstrijken van deze termijn, blijven de Leden van de Raad van Beheer aan totdat deze verkiezingen zijn gehouden.   
6.  De wijze van voorziening in opengevallen plaatsen, de aanwijzing van plaatsvervangers en andere soortgelijke aangelegenheden kunnen door de Raad van Beheer worden geregeld onder voorbehoud van goedkeuring door de Conferentie.   
7.  De Raad van Beheer kiest uit zijn midden een Voorzitter en twee Ondervoorzitters. Een van deze personen is een regeringsvertegenwoordiger terwijl de andere twee onderscheidenlijk de werkgevers en de werknemers vertegenwoordigen.   
8.  De Raad van Beheer stelt een reglement van orde vast en komt op door de Raad zelf te bepalen tijdstippen bijeen. Een buitengewone zitting moet worden gehouden telkens wanneer ten minste 16 vertegenwoordigers in de Raad van Beheer een schriftelijke aanvraag daartoe hebben ingediend.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Aan het hoofd van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau staat een Directeur-Generaal die wordt aangewezen door de Raad van Beheer van welke hij zijn instructies ontvangt en tegenover welke hij verantwoordelijk is voor de goede gang van zaken van het Bureau alsmede voor de uitvoering van alle andere werkzaamheden die hem worden opgedragen.   
2.  De Directeur-Generaal of zijn plaatsvervanger woont alle bijeenkomsten van de Raad van Beheer bij.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Het personeel van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau wordt aangesteld door de Directeur-Generaal overeenkomstig de door de Raad van Beheer goedgekeurde voorschriften.   
2.  Voor zover zulks met een goede bezetting der posten verenigbaar is, doet de Directeur-Generaal zijn keuze uit personen van verschillende nationaliteiten.   
3.  Een bepaald aantal van deze personen moeten vrouwen zijn.   
4.  De verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeur-Generaal en van het personeel zijn uitsluitend van internationale aard. De Directeur-Generaal en het personeel mogen, bij het vervullen van hun taken, geen instructies van enige regering of van enige andere autoriteit buiten de Organisatie vragen of aanvaarden. Zij dienen zich te onthouden van enig optreden dat in strijd zou zijn met hun positie als internationale ambtenaren die alleen aan de Organisatie verantwoording verschuldigd zijn.   
5.  Ieder Lid van de Organisatie verbindt zich het uitsluitend internationale karakter van de verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeur-Generaal en van het personeel te eerbiedigen en niet te trachten invloed op hen uit te oefenen bij de vervulling van hun taken.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  De werkzaamheden van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau omvatten het verzamelen en het verspreiden van inlichtingen over alle onderwerpen die betrekking hebben op de internationale regeling van de werkomstandigheden en van de arbeidsverhoudingen der werknemers, en in het bijzonder het bestuderen van de vraagstukken die worden voorgesteld ter bespreking door de Conferentie, met het oog op het sluiten van internationale verdragen, alsmede het instellen van alle door de Conferentie of de Raad van Beheer opgedragen bijzondere onderzoeken.   
2.  Met inachtneming van de door de Raad van Beheer eventueel gegeven richtlijnen, zal het Bureau: 

(a) documentatiemateriaal samenstellen betreffende de verschillende punten van de agenda der zittingen van de Conferentie;  

(b) aan de regeringen die hierom verzoeken, voor zover mogelijk, alle gewenste hulp verschaffen bij het opstellen van wetten naar aanleiding van de beslissingen van de Conferentie alsmede bij het verbeteren van de toepassing ervan en van de inspectiesystemen;  

(c) zich overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Statuut kwijten van zijn taken met betrekking tot de feitelijke naleving van de verdragen;  

(d) publikaties betreffende industrie- en arbeidsvraagstukken van internationaal belang opstellen en uitgeven in die talen welke de Raad van Beheer wenselijk acht.     
3.  Verder bezit het Bureau die bevoegdheden en functies welke hem worden toegekend door de Conferentie of de Raad van Beheer.   

### Artikel  11  

De ministeries van de Leden die zich met industrie- en arbeidsvraagstukken bezighouden, kunnen rechtstreeks in verbinding treden met de Directeur-Generaal door tussenkomst van hun regeringsvertegenwoordiger in de Raad van Beheer van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau of, indien een zodanige vertegenwoordiger ontbreekt, door tussenkomst van enige andere bevoegde functionaris die daartoe door de betrokken regering is aangewezen.  

### Artikel  12  

1.  Binnen het kader van dit Statuut werkt de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie samen met iedere algemene internationale organisatie die is belast met het coördineren van de werkzaamheden van publiekrechtelijke internationale organisaties die gespecialiseerde taken hebben alsmede met publiekrechtelijke internationale organisaties die gespecialiseerde taken hebben op aanverwante gebieden.   
2.  De Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kan de nodige maatregelen treffen om de vertegenwoordigers van publiekrechtelijke internationale organisaties zonder stemrecht aan haar beraadslagingen te doen deelnemen.   
3.  De Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kan de nodige maatregelen treffen om, indien zij dit wenselijk oordeelt, erkende niet-gouvernementele internationale organisaties te raadplegen, met inbegrip van internationale organisaties van werkgevers, werknemers, landbouwers en coöperatieve organisaties.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  De Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kan met de Verenigde Naties zodanige financiële en budgettaire regelingen treffen als wenselijk worden geacht.   
2.  In afwachting van het treffen van zodanige regelingen of indien te eniger tijd zodanige regelingen niet van kracht zijn: 

(a) betaalt ieder Lid de reis- en verblijfkosten van zijn afgevaardigden en hun adviseurs alsmede van zijn vertegenwoordigers die deelnemen aan de zittingen van de Conferentie en van de Raad van Beheer, naar gelang van het geval;  

(b) worden alle andere kosten van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau en van de zittingen van de Conferentie of van de Raad van Beheer betaald door de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau uit de algemene middelen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie;  

(c) worden de regelingen met betrekking tot de goedkeuring van de begroting van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, alsmede tot het bepalen en het innen van de bijdragen van de Leden, vastgesteld door de Conferentie met een meerderheid van twee derde der door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen, en houden deze regelingen in dat de begroting en de regelingen betreffende de verdeling van de kosten onder de Leden van de Organisatie moeten worden goedgekeurd door een commissie bestaande uit regeringsafgevaardigden.     
3.  De kosten van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie worden gedragen door de Leden overeenkomstig de krachtens lid 1 of lid 2, letter (c), van dit artikel geldende regelingen.   
4.  Een lid van de Organisatie dat nog niet zijn financiële bijdrage aan de Organisatie heeft betaald, mag geen stem uitbrengen in de Conferentie, de Raad van Beheer, enige commissie of bij de verkiezing van de Leden van de Raad van Beheer, indien het achterstallige bedrag gelijk is aan of meer bedraagt dan het door hem over de twee volle voorafgaande jaren verschuldigde bedrag. De Conferentie kan evenwel met een meerderheid van twee derde der door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen een zodanig Lid toestaan te stemmen indien zij overtuigd is dat de achterstallige betaling te wijten is aan omstandigheden die buiten de macht van het Lid liggen.   
5.  De Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau is tegenover de Raad van Beheer verantwoordelijk voor de besteding van de middelen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Werkwijze

### Artikel  14  

1.  De Raad van Beheer stelt de agenda voor de zittingen van de Conferentie vast na alle voorstellen te hebben onderzocht die ten aanzien van de te behandelen punten zijn gedaan door de regering van een der Leden, door een representatieve organisatie als bedoeld in artikel 3 of door een publiekrechtelijke internationale organisatie.   
2.  De Raad van Beheer stelt regels vast om, door middel van een voorbereidende technische conferentie of anderszins, een nauwkeurige technische voorbereiding en een behoorlijke raadpleging van de meest belanghebbende Leden te verzekeren alvorens een verdrag of een aanbeveling door de Conferentie wordt aangenomen.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  De Directeur-Generaal treedt op als Secretaris-Generaal van de Conferentie en doet de agenda van elke zitting vier maanden tevoren toekomen aan alle Leden en, door tussenkomst van deze, aan de niet-regeringsafgevaardigden, indien deze laatsten zijn aangewezen.   
2.  De verslagen over elk punt van de agenda moeten de Leden tijdig worden toegezonden om hen in staat te stellen deze behoorlijk te bestuderen vóór de aanvang van de Conferentie. De Raad van Beheer stelt regels vast voor de uitvoering van deze bepaling.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  Iedere regering der Leden heeft het recht zich te verzetten tegen de plaatsing van een of meer der voorgestelde onderwerpen op de agenda van de zitting. De redenen van dit verzet moeten worden uiteengezet in een nota gericht aan de Directeur-Generaal die deze ter kennis brengt van de Leden der Organisatie.   
2.  De onderwerpen waartegen verzet is gerezen blijven echter op de agenda staan indien de Conferentie daartoe besluit met een meerderheid van twee derde der door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen.   
3.  Iedere aangelegenheid ten aanzien waarvan de Conferentie (anders dan bedoeld in het vorige lid) met een zelfde twee derde meerderheid besluit dat deze in behandeling moet worden genomen, wordt op de agenda van de volgende zitting geplaatst.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  De Conferentie kiest een voorzitter en drie ondervoorzitters. Als ondervoorzitters worden gekozen een regeringsafgevaardigde, een afgevaardigde van de werkgevers en een afgevaardigde van de werknemers. De Conferentie stelt haar eigen reglement van orde vast en kan commissies benoemen voor het uitbrengen van verslagen over alle vraagstukken die naar haar mening in studie moeten worden genomen.   
2.  De eenvoudige meerderheid der door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen is beslissend in alle gevallen waarin een grotere meerderheid niet uitdrukkelijk is vereist ingevolge andere artikelen van dit Statuut, bepalingen van een verdrag of een akte waarbij bevoegdheden aan de Conferentie worden toegekend, of ingevolge de krachtens artikel 13 aanvaarde financiële of budgettaire regelingen.   
3.  De stemming is ongeldig indien het aantal uitgebrachte stemmen minder is dan de helft van het aantal der bij de zitting van de Conferentie aanwezige afgevaardigden.   

### Artikel  18  

De Conferentie kan aan de door haar ingestelde commissies adviseurs toevoegen die geen stemrecht hebben.  

### Artikel  19  

1.  Indien de Conferentie zich uitspreekt voor het aannemen van voorstellen die betrekking hebben op een punt van de agenda, dient zij te bepalen of deze voorstellen de vorm zullen krijgen van: *(a)* een internationaal verdrag; *(b)* een aanbeveling, wanneer het behandelde onderwerp of een aspect daarvan op dat ogenblik niet geschikt wordt geacht voor een verdrag.   
2.  Voor het aannemen zowel van een verdrag als van een aanbeveling is bij de eindstemming door de Conferentie een meerderheid van twee derde der door de aanwezige afgevaardigden uitgebrachte stemmen vereist.   
3.  Bij het opstellen van een verdrag of van een aanbeveling van algemene toepassing, dient de Conferentie rekening te houden met die landen waarin, door het klimaat, door onvolledige ontwikkeling van de nijverheidsorganisatie of door andere bijzondere omstandigheden, de situatie in de industrie sterk afwijkt van die in andere landen, en moet zij zodanige wijzigingen voorstellen als zij nodig oordeelt om aan de situatie in dergelijke landen tegemoet te komen.   
4.  Twee exemplaren van het verdrag of van de aanbeveling worden door de Voorzitter van de Conferentie en de Directeur-Generaal ondertekend. Eén van deze exemplaren wordt nedergelegd in het archief van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau, terwijl het andere wordt gezonden aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties. De Directeur-Generaal doet een gewaarmerkt afschrift van het verdrag of van de aanbeveling aan elk Lid toekomen.   
5.  Indien het een verdrag betreft, gelden de volgende voorschriften: 

(a) het verdrag wordt aan alle Leden ter bekrachtiging toegezonden;  

(b) ieder Lid verbindt zich om binnen één jaar na de sluiting van de zitting der Conferentie of, indien in verband met buitengewone omstandigheden zulks binnen een jaar niet mogelijk is, zo spoedig mogelijk doch in geen geval later dan achttien maanden na de sluiting van de zitting der Conferentie het verdrag voor te leggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten, opdat er wetgevende of andere maatregelen ter zake worden genomen;  

(c) de Leden stellen de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau in kennis van de maatregelen die zij ingevolge het bepaalde in dit artikel hebben genomen om het verdrag aan de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten voor te leggen, terwijl zij hem alle inlichtingen verschaffen over de als bevoegd beschouwde autoriteit of autoriteiten alsmede over de beslissingen die deze autoriteit of autoriteiten nemen;  

(d) het Lid dat de goedkeuring van de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten heeft gekregen, doet de Directeur-Generaal mededeling van de officiële bekrachtiging van het verdrag en neemt de nodige maatregelen om aan de bepalingen van dat verdrag uitvoering te geven;  

(e) indien een verdrag niet wordt goedgekeurd door de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten, is het Lid alleen verplicht om, op door de Raad van Beheer te bepalen tijdstippen, aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau verslag uit te brengen omtrent de stand van zijn wetgeving en omtrent de in zijn land geldende gebruiken met betrekking tot de in het verdrag behandelde aangelegenheid, daarbij nauwkeurig aangevend in hoeverre aan iedere bepaling van het verdrag gevolg is gegeven of zal worden gegeven door middel van wetgevende of bestuurlijke maatregelen, collectieve overeenkomsten of anderszins, alsmede welke moeilijkheden de bekrachtiging van dat verdrag verhinderen of vertragen.     
6.  Indien het een aanbeveling betreft, gelden de volgende voorschriften: 

(a) de aanbeveling wordt aan alle Leden ter bestudering toegezonden, ten einde hieraan door de nationale wetgeving of anderszins uitvoering te geven;  

(b) ieder Lid verbindt zich om binnen een jaar na de sluiting van de zitting der Conferentie of, indien in verband met buitengewone omstandigheden zulks binnen een jaar niet mogelijk is, zo spoedig mogelijk doch in geen geval later dan achttien maanden na de sluiting van de zitting der Conferentie, de aanbeveling voor te leggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten opdat er wetgevende of andere maatregelen ter zake worden genomen;  

(c) de Leden stellen de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau in kennis van de maatregelen die zij ingevolge het bepaalde in dit artikel hebben genomen om de aanbeveling aan de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten voor te leggen, terwijl zij hem alle inlichtingen verschaffen over de als bevoegd beschouwde autoriteit of autoriteiten alsmede over de beslissingen die deze autoriteit of autoriteiten nemen;  

(d) afgezien van de verplichting de aanbeveling voor te leggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten, zijn de Leden alleen verplicht om, op de door de Raad van Beheer te bepalen tijdstippen, aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau verslag uit te brengen omtrent de stand van hun wetgeving en omtrent de in hun land geldende gebruiken met betrekking tot de in de aanbeveling behandelde aangelegenheid, daarbij nauwkeurig aangevend in hoeverre aan iedere bepaling van de aanbeveling gevolg is gegeven of zal worden gegeven, alsmede welke wijzigingen van deze bepalingen zij eventueel noodzakelijk achten met het oog op de aanneming of de toepassing ervan.     
7.  Wanneer het een bondsstaat betreft, gelden de volgende voorschriften: 

(a) met betrekking tot de verdragen en aanbevelingen ten aanzien waarvan de regering van een bondsstaat, krachtens diens grondwettelijk stelsel, een optreden door de bondsstaat zelf gewenst acht, zijn de verplichtingen van die bondsstaat dezelfde als die van de Leden die geen bondsstaat zijn;  

(b) met betrekking tot de verdragen en aanbevelingen ten aanzien waarvan de regering van een bondsstaat, krachtens diens grondwettelijk stelsel, een optreden door de deelstaten, provincies of kantons op alle of sommige punten wenselijker acht dan een optreden door de bondsstaat zelf, moet deze regering: 

(i) overeenkomstig haar grondwet en de grondwetten van de betrokken deelstaten, provincies of kantons, doeltreffende maatregelen nemen opdat deze verdragen of aanbevelingen niet later dan achttien maanden na de sluiting van de zitting der Conferentie worden voorgelegd aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de bondsstaat, van de deelstaten, van de provincies of van de kantons, met het oog op het treffen van wetgevende of andere maatregelen;  

(ii) onder voorbehoud van de goedkeuring door de betrokken deelstaten, provincies of kantons, maatregelen nemen voor periodiek overleg tussen de autoriteiten van de bondsstaat enerzijds en de autoriteiten van de deelstaten, provincies of kantons anderzijds, ten einde binnen de bondsstaat een coördinatie te bevorderen van de werkzaamheden die erop zijn gericht de bepalingen van deze verdragen en aanbevelingen ten uitvoer te leggen;  

(iii) de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau mededeling doen van de overeenkomstig dit artikel genomen maatregelen om deze verdragen en aanbevelingen voor te leggen aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de bondsstaat, van de deelstaten, van de provincies of van de kantons, terwijl zij hem alle inlichtingen verschaft over de als bevoegd beschouwde autoriteiten alsmede over de beslissingen die deze autoriteiten nemen;  

(iv) ten aanzien van elk verdrag dat zij niet heeft bekrachtigd, op de door de Raad van Beheer vast te stellen tijdstippen de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau verslag uitbrengen omtrent de stand van de wetgeving en van de gebruiken in de bondsstaat, de deelstaten, de provincies of de kantons met betrekking tot de in het verdrag behandelde aangelegenheid, daarbij nauwkeurig aangevend in hoeverre aan de bepalingen van het verdrag gevolg is gegeven of zal worden gegeven door middel van wetgevende of bestuurlijke maatregelen, collectieve overeenkomsten of anderszins;  

(v) ten aanzien van elke aanbeveling, op de door de Raad van Beheer vast te stellen tijdstippen aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau verslag uitbrengen omtrent de stand van de wetgeving en de gebruiken in de bondsstaat, de deelstaten, de provincies of de kantons met betrekking tot de in de aanbeveling behandelde aangelegenheid, daarbij nauwkeurig aangevend in hoeverre aan de bepalingen van de aanbeveling gevolg is gegeven of zal worden gegeven alsmede welke wijzigingen van deze bepalingen zij eventueel noodzakelijk acht met het oog op de aanneming of de toepassing ervan.       
8.  In geen geval mag de aanneming van een verdrag of een aanbeveling door de Conferentie, of de bekrachtiging van een verdrag door een Lid, worden beschouwd van invloed te zijn op een wet, uitspraak, gewoonte of overeenkomst die aan de betrokken werknemers gunstiger voorwaarden biedt dan het verdrag of de aanbeveling.   

### Artikel  20  

Ieder aldus bekrachtigd verdrag wordt door de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau ter kennis gebracht van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties ten einde overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 102 van het Handvest der Verenigde Naties te worden geregistreerd, maar is slechts bindend voor de Leden die het hebben bekrachtigd.

4.  Dezelfde werkwijze kan door de Raad worden gevolgd zowel ambtshalve als naar aanleiding van een door een afgevaardigde ter Conferentie ingediende klacht.   
5.  Wanneer een uit de toepassing van het bepaalde in de artikelen 25 of 26 voortvloeiende aangelegenheid wordt behandeld door de Raad van Beheer, heeft de betrokken regering, indien zij niet reeds in de Raad van Beheer is vertegenwoordigd, het recht een afgevaardigde te doen deelnemen aan de beraadslagingen van de Raad over deze aangelegenheid.

### BIJLAGE  

####Verklaring betreffende de doeleinden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie

De Algemene Conferentie van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, in haar zesentwintigste zitting op 10 mei 1944, aanvaardt deze verklaring betreffende de doeleinden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie en betreffende de beginselen die de leidraad dienen te vormen voor het beleid van haar Leden. 

I De Conferentie bevestigt opnieuw de grondbeginselen waarop de Organisatie berust, in het bijzonder de volgende: 

(a) arbeid is geen koopwaar;  

(b) vrijheid van meningsuiting en vereniging is een wezenlijke voorwaarde voor gestadige vooruitgang;  

(c) armoede, waar ook ter wereld, brengt de welvaart van alle mensen in gevaar;  

(d) de strijd tegen gebrek dient onder alle volkeren te worden gevoerd met een niet aflatende kracht door middel van voortdurende en gezamenlijke inspanningen op internationaal niveau waarbij de vertegenwoordigers van werknemers en werkgevers, op voet van gelijkheid samenwerkend met regeringsvertegenwoordigers, deelnemen aan open gesprekken en op democratische wijze besluiten nemen met het doel de welvaart in het algemeen te bevorderen.    

II In de overtuiging dat de ervaring ruimschoots de juistheid heeft aangetoond van de in het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie vervatte verklaring dat een duurzame vrede alleen kan worden gevestigd indien er sociale rechtvaardigheid bestaat, bevestigt de Conferentie dat: 

(a) alle mensen, ongeacht hun ras, geloof of geslacht, het recht hebben om, in vrijheid en waardigheid, in economische zekerheid en met gelijkheid van kansen, te streven naar materiële vooruitgang en naar geestelijke ontwikkeling;  

(b) de verwezenlijking van de omstandigheden die dit mogelijk maken, het voornaamste doel moet zijn van de nationale en de internationale politiek;  

(c) alle nationale en internationale programma's en maatregelen, met name op economisch en financieel gebied, vanuit dit standpunt dienen te worden beoordeeld en alleen te worden aanvaard voor zover blijkt dat hierdoor het bereiken van deze fundamentele doelstelling wordt bevorderd en niet wordt belemmerd;  

(d) het tot de taak van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie behoort alle internationale programma's en maatregelen op economisch en financieel gebied te onderzoeken en te beoordelen in het licht van deze fundamentele doelstelling;  

(e) de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, bij de vervulling van de haar toevertrouwde taken, bevoegd is in haar beslissingen en aanbevelingen alle voorschriften op te nemen die zij wenselijk acht, daarbij rekening houdend met alle ter zake dienende economische en financiële factoren.    

III De Conferentie beschouwt het als de verheven plicht van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie te bevorderen dat er overal ter wereld programma's worden opgesteld die zijn gericht op: 

(a) volledige werkgelegenheid en verhoging van de levensstandaard;  

(b) tewerkstelling van de werknemers op die plaatsen waar zij de voldoening kunnen vinden hun bekwaamheden en hun kennis zo volledig mogelijk aan te wenden en de ruimste bijdragen te leveren aan het algemeen welzijn;  

(c) voorzieningen voor opleiding en vergemakkelijking van overplaatsing van werknemers, waaronder begrepen migratie met het oog op werkgelegenheid en vestigingsmogelijkheden, met behoorlijke waarborgen voor alle betrokkenen;  

(d) de mogelijkheid voor allen een rechtvaardig aandeel in de vruchten van de vooruitgang te verkrijgen, met betrekking tot loon en verdiensten, arbeidsduur en andere arbeidsvoorwaarden, alsmede een loon voor een bestaansminimum te garanderen aan alle werknemers die een dergelijke bescherming behoeven;  

(e) de daadwerkelijke erkenning van het recht op collectieve onderhandelingen, de samenwerking tussen werkgevers en werknemers met het oog op een voortgaande verbetering van de produktiviteit alsmede de samenwerking tussen werknemers en werkgevers bij de voorbereiding en de toepassing van sociale en economische maatregelen;  

(f) de uitbreiding van maatregelen betreffende sociale zekerheid ten einde voor allen die een dergelijke bescherming behoeven een minimuminkomen alsmede een volledige geneeskundige verzorging te waarborgen;  

(g) een afdoende bescherming van het leven en de gezondheid van de werknemers in alle beroepen;  

(h) voorzieningen op het gebied van de zorg voor moeder en kind;  

(i) voorzieningen ten behoeve van een behoorlijke voeding, huisvesting, vrijetijdsbesteding en culturele ontwikkeling;  

(j) het waarborgen van gelijke kansen op het gebied van het algemene onderwijs en het vakonderwijs.    

IV In de overtuiging dat, met het oog op de verwezenlijking van de in deze verklaring vervatte doelstellingen, een vollediger en uitgebreider gebruikmaking van de over de hele wereld bestaande produktiemogelijkheden kan worden bereikt door een doeltreffende aanpak op internationaal en nationaal niveau en wel door middel van maatregelen die erop gericht zijn de produktie en de consumptie uit te breiden, ernstige conjunctuurschommelingen te voorkomen, de economische en sociale vooruitgang in de minder ontwikkelde gebieden der aarde te bevorderen, een groter stabiliteit in de wereldmarktprijzen van grondstoffen en voedingsmiddelen te bevorderen en de omvang van de internationale handel op een hoog peil te brengen en te houden, verklaart de Conferentie plechtig dat de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie volledig zal samenwerken met die internationale organen die kunnen worden belast met een deel van de verantwoordelijkheid voor deze grootse taak en voor de bevordering van de gezondheid, het onderwijs en het welzijn van alle volken.  

V De Conferentie bevestigt dat de in deze verklaring tot uitdrukking gebrachte beginselen volledig van toepassing zijn op alle volken der aarde en dat, hoewel de wijze van toepassing dient te worden bepaald met. inachtneming van de door ieder volk bereikte graad van sociale en economische ontwikkeling, de gehele beschaafde wereld ermee gediend is dat deze beginselen steeds meer worden toegepast op de volken die nog niet onafhankelijk zijn alsmede op de volken die reeds zelfbestuur hebben verkregen.
