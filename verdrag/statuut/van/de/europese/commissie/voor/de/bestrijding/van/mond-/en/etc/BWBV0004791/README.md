3.  Aan het einde van iedere gewone zitting kiest de Commissie uit de afgevaardigden een Voorzitter en twee Vicevoorzitters.

De Commissie benoemt tevens de leden van speciale of permanente subcommissies.   
4.  De Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie roept, in overleg met de Voorzitter van de Commissie, ten minste eenmaal per twee jaar een gewone zitting van de Commissie bijeen.

3.  Het lidmaatschap van dergelijke subcommissies kan openstaan voor alle Leden van de Commissie of kan bestaan uit daartoe gekozen Leden van de Commissie of uit personen die op persoonlijke titel worden benoemd vanwege hun deskundigheid op technisch gebied, als vastgesteld door de Commissie. Op voorstel van de Voorzitter kunnen waarnemers worden uitgenodigd deel te nemen aan de zittingen van de speciale en permanente subcommissies.

2.  Voorstellen tot wijziging van het Statuut kunnen door ieder Lid van de Commissie worden gedaan, in een mededeling welke is gericht zowel aan de Voorzitter van de Commissie als aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie. De Directeur-Generaal stelt alle Leden van de Commissie onverwijld in kennis van alle voorstellen tot wijziging.   
3.  Op de agenda van een zitting wordt geen voorstel tot wijziging van het Statuut geplaatst, tenzij hiervan door de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie ten minste 120 dagen voor de opening van de zitting bericht is ontvangen.   
4.  Wijzigingen worden pas van kracht na instemming van de Raad van de Organisatie.   
5.  Een wijziging die geen aanvullende verplichtingen voor de Leden van de Commissie met zich meebrengt wordt van kracht op de datum waarop de Raad het besluit neemt.   
6.  Een wijziging die, naar de mening van de Commissie, aanvullende verplichtingen voor de Leden van de Commissie met zich meebrengt, is, na goedkeuring door de Raad, voor de Leden van de Commissie die de wijziging hebben aanvaard bindend vanaf de datum waarop deze door twee derde van de Leden van de Commissie is aanvaard, en vervolgens voor elk overig Lid van de Commissie op de datum van ontvangst door de Directeur-Generaal van de akte van aanvaarding van de wijziging door dat Lid.   
7.  De akten van aanvaarding van wijzigingen die aanvullende verplichtingen met zich meebrengen worden nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal die alle Leden van de Commissie in kennis stelt van de ontvangst van dergelijke akten.

9.  De Directeur-Generaal stelt alle Leden van de Commissie in kennis van het van kracht worden van een wijziging.   

### Artikel  XV  

####Toetreding

1.  Toetreding tot dit Statuut geschiedt door de nederlegging van een akte van toetreding bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie en wordt ten aanzien van de Leden van de Organisatie of van het Bureau van kracht na ontvangst van een zodanige akte door de Directeur-Generaal, die daarvan elk van de Leden van de Commissie onverwijld in kennis stelt.   
2.  Het lidmaatschap van Staten die uit hoofde van artikel I in aanmerking komen voor lidmaatschap, maar noch Lid van de Organisatie noch van het Bureau zijn, treedt in werking op de datum waarop de Commissie de aanvraag tot lidmaatschap goedkeurt in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel I. De Directeur-Generaal stelt elk van de Leden van de Commissie in kennis van de goedkeuring van een aanvraag tot lidmaatschap.   
3.  Bij de toetreding tot het Statuut kunnen voorbehouden worden gemaakt. De Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie stelt elk van de Leden van de Commissie onverwijld in kennis van de ontvangst van elke aanvraag tot lidmaatschap of elke akte van toetreding tot het Statuut waarin een voorbehoud wordt gemaakt. Een voorbehoud wordt alleen van kracht na unanieme goedkeuring door de Leden van de Commissie. De Leden van de Commissie die binnen drie maanden na de datum van kennisgeving door de Directeur-Generaal van het voorbehoud geen antwoord hebben gegeven worden geacht het voorbehoud te hebben aanvaard. Ingeval het voorbehoud niet unaniem wordt aanvaard door de Leden van de Commissie, wordt het land dat het voorbehoud maakt geen Partij bij dit Statuut.   

### Artikel  XVI  

####Terugtrekking

1.  Elk Lid kan zich op ieder tijdstip na verloop van één jaar vanaf het tijdstip waarop hij tot het Statuut is toegetreden, of vanaf het tijdstip waarop het Statuut van kracht werd, naargelang welk tijdstip later valt, uit de Commissie terugtrekken, door het zenden van een schriftelijk bericht van terugtrekking aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie, die daarvan onverwijld aan alle Leden van de Commissie mededeling doet. De terugtrekking wordt van kracht een jaar na het tijdstip van ontvangst van de kennisgeving van terugtrekking.   
2.  Het niet betalen van twee achtereenvolgende jaarlijkse bijdragen wordt geacht de terugtrekking te impliceren van het in gebreke gebleven Lid van de Commissie.   
3.  Ieder Lid van de Commissie dat zich terugtrekt uit de Organisatie of het Bureau wordt, indien het gevolg van deze terugtrekking is dat dit land niet langer Lid is van een van deze beide organen, geacht zich tegelijkertijd te hebben teruggetrokken uit de Commissie.   

### Artikel  XVII  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Mocht er enig geschil rijzen aangaande de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Statuut, dan kan het betreffende Lid of kunnen de betreffende Leden de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie verzoeken een commissie in te stellen ter beoordeling van het geschil.   
2.  Daarop stelt de Directeur-Generaal, in overleg met de betreffende Leden, een commissie van deskundigen in, waarin vertegenwoordigers van die Leden mede zitting hebben. Deze commissie beoordeelt het geschil, in welke beoordeling zij alle documenten en andere bewijsstukken, welke door de Leden zijn overgelegd, betrekt. Deze Commissie legt een rapport voor aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie, die dit doorzendt aan de betreffende Leden en aan de andere Leden van de Commissie.   
3.  De Leden van de Commissie gaan ermee akkoord dat de aanbevelingen van deze commissie van onderzoek, hoewel niet bindend, als basis worden aanvaard voor een nieuwe beoordeling door de betreffende Leden van de aangelegenheid waaruit het geschil is ontstaan.   
4.  De betreffende Leden dragen ieder voor een gelijk deel de kosten van de deskundigen.   

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Beëindiging

1.  Dit Statuut wordt beëindigd bij beslissing van de Commissie, welke met een drie vierde meerderheid van het aantal Leden van de Commissie dient te worden genomen. Het wordt automatisch beëindigd indien het aantal Leden, ten gevolge van terugtrekkingen, minder dan zes zou bedragen.   
2.  Bij beëindiging van het Statuut worden alle activa van de Commissie door de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie geliquideerd, en nadat is voldaan aan alle verplichtingen, wordt het saldo onder de Leden verdeeld in een verhouding welke is gebaseerd op de op dat tijdstip geldende bijdragenschaal. De landen welke hun bijdragen gedurende twee achtereenvolgende jaren niet hebben betaald, en zich om die reden, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel XVI, tweede lid, worden geacht te hebben teruggetrokken, hebben geen recht op een aandeel in de activa.   

### Artikel  XIX  

####Inwerkingtreding

1.  Dit Statuut treedt in werking na ontvangst door de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van de kennisgevingen van toetreding van zes Staten-leden van de Organisatie, of van het Bureau, mits hun bijdragen in totaal niet minder bedragen dan 30% van de administratieve begroting, bedoeld in artikel XIII, eerste lid.   
2.  De Directeur-Generaal stelt alle Staten, welke een kennisgeving van toetreding hebben nedergelegd, in kennis van de dag waarop dit Statuut in werking treedt.   
3.  De tekst van dit Statuut, gesteld in de Engelse, de Franse en de Spaanse taal, zijnde deze talen gelijkelijk authentiek, is door de Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie goedgekeurd op de elfde dag van december 1953.   
4.
