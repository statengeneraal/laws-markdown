####CONSTITUTION OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

The States parties to this Constitution declare, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, that the following principles are basic to the happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples: Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all.

####STATUUT VAN DE WERELDGEZONDHEIDSORGANISATIE.

De Staten, die partij zijn bij dit Statuut, verklaren in overeenstemming met het Handvest van de Vereenigde Naties, dat de volgende beginselen een noodzakelijke grondslag zijn voor het geluk, de harmonieuze verhoudingen en veiligheid van alle volken: Gezondheid is een toestand van volledig lichamelijk, geestelijk en sociaal welzijn en niet slechts de afwezigheid van ziekte of zwakheid. Het genot van een zoo goed mogelijken gezondheidstoestand is een van de grondrechten van ieder menschelijk wezen zonder onderscheid van ras, godsdienst, politiek geloof, economische of sociale positie. De gezondheid van alle volken is een noodzakelijke voorwaarde voor het bereiken van vrede en veiligheid en is afhankelijk van de meest volledige samenwerking van individuen en Staten. Hetgeen een Staat bereikt op het gebied van bevorderen en beschermen van de gezondheid is van waarde voor allen. Ongelijke ontwikkeling in de verschillende landen in het bevorderen van de gezondheid en het bestrijden, van ziekten, in het bijzonder van besmettelijke ziekten, is een gemeenschappelijk gevaar. Een gezonde ontwikkeling van het kind is van fundamenteel belang; geschiktheid om harmonieus te leven in een geheel veranderende omgeving is een essentieele voorwaarde voor zoodanige ontwikkeling. Het verbreiden onder alle volken van de weldaden der medische, psychologische en aanverwante wetenschappen is van essentieel belang voor het bereiken van een zoo hoog mogelijk gezondheidspeil. Een goed voorgelichte openbare meening en actieve medewerking van de zijde van het publiek zijn van het grootste belang voor de verbetering van de volksgezondheid. Regeeringen dragen verantwoordelijkheid voor de gezondheid van haar volken, aan welke verantwoordelijkheid alleen kan worden voldaan door het nemen van doeltreffende maatregelen, zoowel op gezondheidsgebied, als op sociaal gebied. Deze beginselen aanvaardende en met het doel samen te werken met elkander en met anderen ter bevordering en bescherming van de gezondheid van alle volken, stemmen de verdragsluitende partijen in met dit Statuut en richten zij hierbij op de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie als een gespecialiseerde organisatie van de Vereenigde Naties.
