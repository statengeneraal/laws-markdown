Vehicles admitted under the cover of temporary importation papers may be used, for their private use, by third persons duly authorized by the holders of the papers, provided that those third persons normally reside outside the country of importation and also fulfil the other conditions laid down in this Convention. The Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties have the right to require evidence that such persons have been duly authorized by the holders of the papers and fulfil the aforesaid conditions. If this evidence does not appear sufficient, the Customs authorities may refuse use of the vehicle in their country under cover of the papers. In the case of vehicles which have been hired, each Contracting Party may, in the case of fear of abuse, require that the holder of the temporary importation paper be present at the time of importation of the vehicle.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties may permit, in special circumstances and under conditions of which they shall be sole judges, a vehicle circulating under cover of temporary importation papers to be driven by a person who is normally resident in the country of importation, in particular when the driver drives the vehicle on behalf of or under instructions from the holder of the temporary importation papers.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####Conditions of temporary importation

### Article  12  

1.  The vehicles mentioned in the temporary importation papers shall be re-exported in the same general state, except for wear and tear, within the period of validity of such papers.

2.  Evidence of re-exportation shall be provided by the exit visa properly appended to the temporary importation papers by the Customs authorities of the country into which the vehicles were temporarily imported.   

### Article  13  

1.  Notwithstanding the requirement of re-exportation laid down in article 12, the re-exportation of badly damaged vehicles shall not be required, in the case of duly authenticated accidents, provided that the vehicles: 

(a) are subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable; or  

(b) are abandoned free of all expenses to the Exchequer of the country into which they were imported temporarily, in which case the holder of the temporary importation papers shall be exempt from import duties and import taxes; or  

(c) are destroyed, under official supervision, at the expense of the parties concerned, any salvaged parts and materials being subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable   as the Customs authorities may require.   
2.  When a vehicle temporarily admitted cannot be re-exported as a result of a seizure, other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, the requirement of re-exportation within the period of validity of the temporary importation papers shall be suspended for the duration of the seizure.   
3.  The Customs authorities shall notify, so far as possible, to the guaranteeing association, seizures made by or on behalf of these Customs authorities of vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation papers guaranteed by that association and shall advise it of the measures they intend to take.   
4.  When the vehicle or the object listed in the papers are either lost or stolen during the course of seizure only during the period when the public authority possesses the vehicle or the object other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, no import duties or import taxes can be levied against the holder of the temporary importation papers, who should submit evidence of seizure to the Customs Authorities.   

### Article  14  

Vehicles imported into the territory of one of the Contracting Parties under cover of temporary importation papers may not be used even incidentally for transport against payment, reward or other consideration between points within the frontiers of that territory.  

### Article  15  

Persons entitled to temporary importation facilities may, during the period of validity of temporary importation papers, import the vehicles covered by those papers as often as necessary, on condition that they have each passage (entry and exit) established by a visa of the Customs officers concerned if the Customs authorities so require. Temporary importation papers may be made valid for a single journey only.  

### Article  16  

When temporary importation papers without detachable vouchers for each passage are used, the visas given by the Customs officers between the first entry and the final exit are provisional. Nevertheless, when the last visa is a provisional exit visa, it will be admitted as proof of the re-exportation of the vehicle or component parts temporarily imported.  

### Article  17  

When temporary importation papers with a detachable voucher for each passage are used, each entry implies the passing of the document by the Customs, and each subsequent exit constitutes its final discharge, except as provided in article 18.  

### Article  18  

When the Customs authorities of a country have finally and unconditionally discharged temporary importation papers they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of import duties and import taxes, unless the certificate of discharge was obtained improperly or fraudulently.  

### Article  19  

Visas on temporary importation papers used under the conditions laid down in this Convention shall not be subject to the payment of charges for Customs attendance during the authorized hours for Customs offices and posts.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####Extension of validity and renewal of temporary importation papers

### Article  20  

The lack of proof of re-exportation within the time allowed of vehicles temporarily imported shall be disregarded when the vehicles are presented to the Customs authorities for re-exportation within fourteen days from the expiry of the temporary entry deadline for the vehicles and satisfactory explanations of the delay are given.  

### Article  21  

Each of the Contracting Parties shall recognize as valid extensions of validity of *carnets de passages en douane* granted by another Contracting Party in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex 3 of this Convention.  

### Article  22  

1.  Requests for extension of validity of temporary importation papers shall be presented to the competent Customs authorities before the expiry of the period of validity of these papers, unless this is rendered impossible by *force majeure.* If the temporary importation paper has been issued by an authorized association, the request for extension shall be made by the association which guarantees the papers.   
2.  Extensions of time necessary for the re-exportation of vehicles or component parts imported temporarily shall be granted when the persons concerned can establish to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that they are prevented by *force majeure* from re-exporting the said vehicles or component parts within the time allowed.   
3.  The validity of temporary importation papers can only be extended once for not more than one year. After this period, a new carnet must be issued and delivered in replacement of the former carnet.   

### Article  23  

Each of the Contracting Parties shall, unless the conditions of temporary admission are no longer satisfied, authorize, subject to whatever measures of control they may consider necessary, the renewal of temporary importation papers issued by the authorized associations and relating to vehicles or component parts temporarily imported into its territory. Requests for renewal shall be presented by the guaranteeing association.  

### CHAPTER  VII  

####Regularization of temporary importation papers

### Article  24  

1.  If temporary importation papers have not been regularly discharged, the Customs authorities of the country of importation shall (whether the papers have expired or not) accept as evidence of re-exportation of the vehicle or component parts the presentation of a certificate based on the standard form shown in Annex 4 of this Convention issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer, etc.), attesting the facts that the vehicle or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside the country of importation. As an alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the vehicle or component parts are outside the country of temporary importation. In the case of papers, other than the *carnets de passages en douane,* which have not expired, the papers shall be produced at the same time as the évidence referred to above. In the case of carnets the Customs authorities shall accept, as evidence of re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts, the visas entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries subsequently visited.   
2.  In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of a temporary importation paper not regularly discharged but relating to a vehicle or component parts which have been re-exported, the Customs authorities of the country of importation shall accept as proof of re-exportation the presentation of a certificate based on the standard form shown in Annex 4 of this Convention issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial official , etc.), attesting the facts that the vehicle or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside the country of importation after the date of expiry of the paper. As an alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the vehicle or component parts are outside the country of temporary importation. <sup> 1)  [Red: Lees „officer”.]  </sup>   
3.  In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of a *carnet de passages en douane* while the vehicle or component parts to which it refers are in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, the Customs authorities of that Party shall, at the request of the association concerned, accept a replacement document, the validity of which expires on the date of expiration of validity of the *carnet* which it replaces. This acceptance will annul the previous acceptance of the *carnet* destroyed, lost or stolen. In case of the misuse of a carnet after cancellation by the Customs authorities and the issuing association, the latter cannot be held responsible for import duties and import taxes payable. If, instead of a replacement document, an export licence or similar document is issued for the re-exportation of the vehicle or component parts, the exit visa on this licence or document shall be considered as sufficient proof of reexportation.   
4.  If the vehicle is stolen after having been re-exported from the country of temporary importation, without the exit having been regularly endorsed on the temporary importation papers and in the absence of entry visas on the papers entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries subsequently visited, the papers may nevertheless be regularized provided that the guaranteeing association furnishes the papers together with such evidence of theft as may be considered sufficient. If the temporary importation papers have not expired, the Customs authorities may require their surrender.   

### Article  25  

In the cases referred to in article 24, the Customs authorities shall have the right to charge a regularization fee.  

### Article  25 bis  

The competent customs authorities shall not require payment of import duties and taxes where it is proved to their satisfaction that a vehicle imported under cover of temporary importation papers can no longer be re-exported because it has been destroyed or irrecoverably lost for reasons of force majeure.  

### Article  26  

Customs authorities shall not have the right to require from the guaranteeing association payment of import duties and import taxes on vehicles or component parts temporarily imported when the nondischarge of the temporary importation papers has not been notified to the guaranteeing association within a year of the date of expiry of the validity of those papers. The Customs authorities shall provide the guaranteeing associations with details of the amount of import duties and import taxes within one year from the notification of the non-discharge. The guaranteeing associations' liability for these sums shall cease if such information is not furnished within this one year period.  

### Article  27  

1.  The guaranteeing associations shall have a period of one year from the date of notification of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers in which to furnish proof of the re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts in question under the conditions laid down in this Convention. Nevertheless, this period can come into force only as of the date of expiry of the temporary importation papers. If the Customs authorities contest the validity of the proof provided they must so inform the guarantor within a period not exceeding one year.   
2.  If such proof is not furnished within the time limit allowed, the guaranteeing association shall deposit or pay provisionally within a maximum period of three months the import duties and import taxes payable. This deposit or payment shall become final after a period of one year from the date of the deposit or provisional payment. During the latter period, the guaranteeing association may still avail itself of the facilities provided by the preceding paragraph with a view to repayment of the sums deposited or paid.   
3.  For countries whose regulations do not provide for the deposit or provisional payment of import duties, payments made in conformity with the provisions of the preceding paragraph will be regarded as final, it being understood that the sums paid may be refunded when the conditions laid down in this article are fulfilled.   
4.  In the case of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers, the guaranteeing association shall not be required to pay a sum greater than the total of the import duties and import taxes applicable to the vehicles or component parts not re-exported, together with interest if applicable.   

### Article  28  

In the event of fraud, contravention or abuse the Contracting Parties shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Convention, be free to take proceedings, against persons using temporary importation papers, for the recovery of the import duties and import taxes and also for the imposition of any penalties to which such persons have rendered themselves liable. In such cases, the guaranteeing associations shall lend their assistance to the Customs authorities.  

### CHAPTER  VIII  

####Miscellaneous Provisions

### Article  29  

The Contracting Parties shall endeavour not to introduce Customs procedures which might have the effect of impeding the development of international touring.  

### Article  30  

In order to expedite Customs procedures contiguous Contracting Parties shall endeavour to place their respective Customs posts close together and to keep them open during the same hours.  

### Article  31  

Any breach of the provisions of this Convention, any substitution, false declaration or act having the effect of causing a person or an article improperly to benefit from the system of importation laid down in this Convention, may render the offender liable in the country where the offence was committed to the penalties prescribed by the laws of that country.  

### Article  32  

Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Contracting Parties which form a customs or economic union from enacting special provisions applicable to residents of the States forming that union.  

### Article  32 bis  

This Convention shall not prevent the application of greater facilities which Contracting Parties grant or may wish to grant, either by unilateral provisions or in virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreements, provided that such facilities do not impede the application of the provisions of this Convention.

### Annex  3  

####EXTENSION OF VALIDITY OF THE “CARNET DE PASSAGES EN DOUANE”

### 1  

The stamp for extension of validity shall conform to the model contained in this annex. The stamp shall be drawn up in English or French. The inscribed wording may be repeated in another language.  

### 2  

The following procedure shall be observed by the person requesting the extension and by the guaranteeing association dealing with the request: 

(a) As soon as the holder of a *carnet de passages en douane* realizes that he is obliged to request an extension of the period of validity of the document, he sends to the guaranteeing association the *carnet* and a request for extension, indicating the circumstances which oblige him to make the request. He will submit with his request, as supporting evidence, such papers as a medical certificate, a statement from the garage repairing his vehicle, or any other authentic document showing that the delay in question is caused by *force majeure.*  

(b) If the guaranteeing association considers that the request for extension might be passed on to the Customs authorities, it stamps the cover of the *carnet de passages en douane* in the space specially reserved for this purpose.  

(c) In the left-hand side of the stamp the guaranteeing association fills in the date, in figures and words, until which the extension is requested. The President or representative of the association signs and the stamp of the association is affixed.  

(d) The length of the extension must not exceed a reasonable period necessary to complete the journey, and should not normally exceed three months from the previous date of expiry of the *carnet.*  

(e) The guraranteeing association then sends the *carnet* to the competent Customs authority of its country. The request made by the holder of the *carnet* and the supporting evidence are attached to the *carnet.*  

(f) The Customs authority decides whether the extension shall be granted. It may reduce the period of extension requested, or refuse to grant any extension. If it is granted, the competent Customs officer completes the stamp placed on the cover of the *carnet* by the guaranteeing association, by adding a serial or registry number, the place and date and his own official position. He then signs and adds the Customs stamp.  

(g) The *carnet* is then returned to the guaranteeing association, which in turn returns it to the person concerned.     ![10000054704](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054704)

### Artikel  8  

De Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer, afgegeven door gemachtigde organisaties, worden gesteld op naam van de eigenaars of op naam van de houders van de tijdelijk ingevoerde voertuigen. In de gevallen dat het gehuurde voertuigen betreft, moeten de Bewijzen worden gesteld op naam van de huurder . <sup> 1)  [Red: Voor de vertaling is op deze plaats, waar de Engelse tekst (“hirer”) en de Franse tekst („loueur”) niet met elkaar overeenstemmen, de Engelse tekst gevolgd.]  </sup>  

### Artikel  9  

1.  Het gewicht dat op de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer moet worden vermeld, is het eigen gewicht van het voertuig. Het moet worden uitgedrukt volgens het metrieke stelsel. Indien de Bewijzen slechts geldig zijn voor één enkel land, kunnen de douane-autoriteiten van dat land het gebruik van een ander stelsel voorschrijven.   
2.  De op de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer te vermelden waarde moet, indien bedoelde Bewijzen slechts voor één enkel land geldig zijn, worden uitgedrukt in de geldsoort van dat land. De waarde welke op een „carnet de passages en douane” moet worden vermeld, dient te zijn uitgedrukt in de geldsoort van het land waar het „carnet” is afgegeven.   
3.  Voorwerpen en gereedschappen welke tot de normale uitrusting van voertuigen behoren, behoeven niet afzonderlijk op de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer te worden vermeld.   
4.  Indien de douane-autoriteiten zulks vorderen, moeten reservedelen (zoals wielen, binnen- en buitenbanden), alsmede toebehoren welke niet geacht worden tot de normale uitrusting van het voertuig te behoren (zoals radio-ontvangtoestellen, aanhangwagens waarvoor geen afzonderlijk Bewijs is afgegeven, en bagagedragers) op de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer worden vermeld met aanduiding van de nodige bijzonderheden (zoals gewicht en waarde). Bij het verlaten van het land dat is bezocht, moeten genoemde delen en toebehoren worden getoond.   

### Artikel  10  

Elke wijziging die wordt aangebracht in hetgeen op de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer is vermeld door de organisatie die de Bewijzen heeft afgegeven, dient door deze organisatie of door de aansprakelijke organisatie behoorlijk te zijn goedgekeurd. Zonder toestemming van de douane-autoriteiten van het land van invoer is geen enkele wijziging toegestaan, nadat de Bewijzen door die autoriteiten voor invoer zijn afgetekend.

####Voorwaarden voor de tijdelijke invoer

### Artikel  12  

1.   De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.    
2.  Dat de wederuitvoer heeft plaatsgehad, blijkt uit de omstandigheid dat het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer op regelmatige wijze voor uitvoer is afgetekend door de douane-autoriteiten van het land waar de voertuigen tijdelijk werden ingevoerd.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  De in artikel 12 neergelegde verplichting tot wederuitvoer geldt niet ten aanzien van voertuigen welke ernstig beschadigd zijn ten gevolge van een ongeval, waarvan op afdoende wijze wordt aangetoond dat het heeft plaatsgehad, mits, al naar gelang de douaneautoriteiten zulks vorderen, de voertuigen 

a) of wel worden onderworpen aan de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer verschuldigd;  

b)  De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.   

c)  De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.      
2.  Indien een voertuig dat tijdelijk ten invoer is toegelaten niet weder kan worden uitgevoerd als gevolg van inbeslagneming of beslaglegging, anders dan op vordering van particulieren tot stand gekomen, wordt de verplichting tot wederuitvoer binnen de geldigheidsduur van het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer opgeschort voor de duur van het beslag.   
3.  Van de gevallen waarin de douane-autoriteiten voertuigen waarvoor de aansprakelijke organisaties Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer hebben afgegeven, in beslag hebben genomen of hebben doen nemen, dan wel daarop beslag hebben gelegd of doen leggen, geven zij voor zover mogelijk kennis aan die organisaties. Zij doen voorts mededeling aan bedoelde organisaties van de maatregelen welke zij voornemens zijn te treffen.   
4.   De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.    

### Artikel  14  

De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.   

### Artikel  15  

Zij die aanspraak kunnen maken op de tijdelijke invoer, mogen binnen de geldigheidsduur van de Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer de daarop vermelde voertuigen invoeren zo vaak als nodig is, mits zij bij elke grensoverschrijding (binnenkomen en uitgaan) de Bewijzen door de betrokken douane-ambtenaren doen aftekenen voor zover de douane-autoriteiten zulks vorderen. Er kunnen echter Bewijzen worden afgegeven voor één enkele reis.  

### Artikel  16  

Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer welke niet zijn voorzien van stroken die bij elke grensoverschrijding kunnen worden uitgescheurd, hebben de aftekeningen door de douane tussen de eerste binnenkomst en het laatste uitgaan een voorlopig karakter. Indien de laatste aftekening een voorlopige aftekening voor uitgaan is, wordt die aftekening niettemin toegelaten als bewijs van de wederuitvoer van de tijdelijk ingevoerde voertuigen of losse onderdelen.  

### Artikel  17  

Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer welke voorzien zijn van stroken die bij elke grensoverschrijding kunnen worden uitgescheurd, brengt elke bevinding van binnenkomst met zich mede dat het Bewijs door de douane voor invoer moet worden afgetekend, en wordt het Bewijs door iedere vaststelling van latere uitvoer definitief gezuiverd, onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 18.  

### Artikel  18  

Indien het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer blijkens de daarop voorkomende aantekeningen van de douane-autoriteiten van een land definitief en zonder voorbehoud is gezuiverd, kunnen die autoriteiten van de aansprakelijke organisatie de betaling van de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer niet meer vorderen, tenzij de zuivering ten onrechte of op frauduleuze wijze werd verkregen.  

### Artikel  19  

Het aftekenen van Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer welke op de voet van dit Verdrag worden gebruikt, geeft geen aanleiding tot betaling van kosten als vergoeding voor de verrichtingen van de douane gedurende de uren van openstelling van de douanekantoren.

1.  Aanvragen tot verlenging van de geldigheidsduur van Bewijzen van tijdelijke invoer moeten, behoudens in geval van overmacht, vóór het verstrijken van de geldigheidsduur bij de bevoegde douane-autoriteiten worden ingediend. Indien het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer is afgegeven door een gemachtigde organisatie, moet het verzoek om verlenging door de aansprakelijke organisatie worden ingediend.   
2.  Verlenging van de geldigheidsduur voor de tijd welke nodig is voor de wederuitvoer van de tijdelijk ingevoerde voertuigen of losse onderdelen, wordt toegestaan indien de belanghebbenden ten genoegen van de douane-autoriteiten kunnen aantonen dat zij door overmacht verhinderd zijn bedoelde voertuigen of losse onderdelen binnen de gestelde termijn weder uit te voeren.

Indien een voertuig is gestolen nadat het weder uit het land van invoer is uitgevoerd zonder dat van het uitgaan op regelmatige wijze aantekening is gesteld op het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer en zonder dat het Bewijs door de douane-autoriteiten van de landen waar het voertuig vervolgens heeft gereden, voor invoer is afgetekend, kan het Bewijs niettemin worden geregulariseerd, mits het wordt overgelegd door de aansprakelijke organisatie en deze de diefstal voldoende aannemelijk maakt. Indien de geldigheidsduur van het Bewijs niet is verstreken, kunnen de douane-autoriteiten vorderen dat het wordt overgelegd.   

### Artikel  25  

De douane-autoriteiten behouden zich het recht voor in de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 24 kosten voor regularisatie te heffen.

4.  Indien het Bewijs van tijdelijke invoer niet is gezuiverd, kan de aansprakelijke organisatie niet worden verplicht meer te betalen dan het bedrag van de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer die verschuldigd zijn voor het voertuig of voor de losse onderdelen, welke niet weder werden uitgevoerd, eventueel vermeerderd met de rente wegens achterstallige betaling.
