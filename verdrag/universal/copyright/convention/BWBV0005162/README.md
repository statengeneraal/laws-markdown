##Universele Auteursrecht-Conventie

####UNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION

The Contracting States, Moved by the desire to assure in all countries copyright protection of literary, scientific and artistic works, Convinced that a system of copyright protection appropriate to all nations of the world and expressed in a universal convention, additional to, and without impairing international systems already in force, will ensure respect for the rights of the individual and encourage the development of literature, the sciences and the arts, Persuaded that such a universal copyright system will facilitate a wider dissemination of works of the human mind and increase international understanding,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

Each Contracting State undertakes to provide for the adequate and effective protection of the rights of authors and other copyright proprietors in literary, scientific and artistic works, including writings, musical, dramatic and cinematographic works, and paintings, engravings and sculpture.  

### Article  II  

1.  Published works of nationals of any Contracting State and works first published in that State shall enjoy in each other Contracting State the same protection as that other State accords to works of its nationals first published in its own territory.   
2.  Unpublished works of nationals of each Contracting State shall enjoy in each other Contracting State the same protection as that other State accords to unpublished works of its own nationals.   
3.  For the purpose of this Convention any Contracting State may, by domestic legislation, assimilate to its own nationals any person domiciled in that State.   

### Article  III  

1.  Any Contracting State which, under its domestic law, requires as a condition of copyright, compliance with formalities such as deposit, registration, notice, notarial certificates, payment of fees or manufacture or publication in that Contracting State, shall regard these requirements as satisfied with respect to all works protected in accordance with this Convention and first published outside its territory and the author of which is not one of its nationals, if from the time of the first publication all the copies of the work published with the authority of the author or other copyright proprietor bear the Symbol © accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor and the year of first publication placed in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of claim of copyright.   
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not preclude any Contracting State from requiring formalities or other conditions for the acquisition and enjoyment of copyright in respect of works first published in its territory or works of its nationals wherever published.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not preclude any Contracting State from providing that a person seeking judicial relief must, in bringing the action, comply with procedural requirements, such as that the complainant must appear through domestic counsel or that the complainant must deposit with the court or an administrative office, or both, a copy of the work involved in the litigation; provided that failure to comply with such requirements shall not affect the validity of the copyright, nor shall any such requirement be imposed upon a national of another Contracting State if such requirement is not imposed on nationals of the State in which protection is claimed.   
4.  In each Contracting State there shall be legal means of protecting without formalities the unpublished works of nationals of other Contracting States.   
5.  If a Contracting State grants protection for more than one term of copyright and the first term is for a period longer than one of the minimum periods prescribed in article IV, such State shall not be required to comply with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article III in respect of the second or any subsequent term of copyright.   

### Article  IV  

1.  The duration of protection of a work shall be governed, in accordance with the provisions of article II and this article, by the law of the Contracting State in which protection is claimed.   
2.  The term of protection for works protected under this Convention shall not be less than the life of the author and 25 years after his death. However, any Contracting State which, on the effective date of this Convention in that State, has limited this term for certain classes of works to a period computed from the first publication of the work, shall be entitled to maintain these exceptions and to extend them to other classes of works. For all these classes the term of protection shall not be less than 25 years from the date of first publication. Any Contracting State which, upon the effective date of this Convention in that State, does not compute the term of protection upon the basis of the life of the author, shall be entitled to compute the term of protection from the date of the first publication of the work or from its registration prior to publication, as the case may be, provided the term of protection shall not be less than 25 years from the date of first publication or from its registration prior to publication, as the case may be. If the legislation of a Contracting State grants two or more successive terms of protection, the duration of the first term shall not be less than one of the minimum periods specified above.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 2 of this article shall not apply to photographic works or to works of applied art; provided, however, that the term of protection in those Contracting States which protect photographic works, or works of applied art in so far as they are protected as artistic works, shall not be less than ten years for each of said classes of works.   
4.  No Contracting State shall be obliged to grant protection to a work for a period longer than that fixed for the class of works to which the work in question belongs, in the case of unpublished works by the law of the Contracting State of which the author is a national, and in the case of published works by the law of the Contracting State in which the work has been first published. For the purposes of the application of the preceding provision, if the law of any Contracting State grants two or more successive terms of protection, the period of protection of that State shall be considered to be the aggregate of those terms. However, if a specified work is not protected by such State during the second or any subsequent term for any reason, the other Contracting States shall not be obliged to protect it during the second or any subsequent term.   
5.  For the purposes of the application of paragraph 4 of this article, the work of a national of a Contracting State, first published in a non-Contracting State, shall be treated as though first published in the Contracting State of which the author is a national.   
6.  For the purposes of the application of paragraph 4 of this article, in case of simultaneous publication in two or more Contracting States, the work shall be treated as though first published in the State which affords the shortest term; any work published in two or more Contracting States within thirty days of its first publication shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in said Contracting States.   

### Article  V  

1.  Copyright shall include the exclusive right of the author to make, publish, and authorize the making and publication of translations of works protected under this Convention.   
2.  However, any Contracting State may, by its domestic legislation, restrict the right of translation of writings, but only subject to the following provisions: If, after the expiration of a period of seven years from the date of the first publication of a writing, a translation of such writing has not been published in the national language or languages, as the case may be, of the Contracting State, by the owner of the right of translation or with his authorization, any national of such Contracting State may obtain a non-exclusive license from the competent authority thereof to translate the work and publish the work so translated in any of the national languages in which it has not been published; provided that such national, in accordance with the procedure of the State concerned, establishes either that he has requested, and been denied, authorization by the proprietor of the right to make and publish the translation, or that, after due diligence on his part, he was unable to find the owner of the right. A license may also be granted on the same conditions if all previous editions of a translation in such language are out of print. If the owner of the right of translation cannot be found, then the applicant for a license shall send copies of his application to the publisher whose name appears on the work and, if the nationality of the owner of the right of translation is known, to the diplomatic or consular representative of the State of which such owner is a national, or to the organization which may have been designated by the government of that State. The license shall not be granted before the expiration of a period of two months from the date of the dispatch of the copies of the application. Due provision shall be made by domestic legislation to assure to the owner of the right of translation a compensation which is just and conforms to international standards, to assure payment and transmittal of such compensation, and to assure a correct translation of the work. The original title and the name of the author of the work shall be printed on all copies of the published translation. The license shall be valid only for publication of the translation in the territory of the Contracting State where it has been applied for. Copies so pubblished may be imported and sold in another Contracting State if one of the national languages of such other State is the same language as that into which the work has been so translated, and if the domestic law in such other State makes provision for such licenses and does not prohibit such importation and sale. Where the foregoing conditions do not exist, the importation and sale of such copies in a Contracting State shall be governed by its domestic law and its agreements. The license shall not be transferred by the licensee. The license shall not be granted when the author has withdrawn from circulation all copies of the work.   

### Article  VI  

“Publication”, as used in this Convention, means the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.  

### Article  VII  

This Convention shall not apply to works or rights in works which, at the effective date of the Convention in a Contracting State where protection is claimed, are permanently in the public domain in the said Contracting State.  

### Article  VIII

This Convention, which shall bear the date of September 6 1952, shall be deposited with the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and shall remain open for signature by all States for a period of 120 days after that date.

### Article  X  

1.  Each State party to this Convention undertakes to adopt, in accordance with its Constitution, such measures as are necessary to ensure the application of this Convention.   
2.  It is understood, however, that at the time an instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession is deposited on behalf of any State, such State must be in a position under its domestic law to give effect to the terms of this Convention.

a) to study the problems concerning the application and operation of this Convention;

####UNIVERSELE AUTEURSRECHT-CONVENTIE

De Verdragsluitende Staten, Bezield door het verlangen, de bescherming van het auteursrecht op werken van letterkunde, wetenschap en kunst in alle landen te verzekeren; Van oordeel, dat een stelsel van bescherming van de rechten der auteurs, geschikt voor alle landen en tot uitdrukking gebracht in een universele conventie, naast de reeds bestaande internationale stelsels en zonder daaraan afbreuk te doen, er toe zal bijdragen de eerbiediging van de rechten van de menselijke persoonlijkheid te verzekeren en de ontwikkeling van letteren, wetenschappen en kunsten te bevorderen; In de overtuiging, dat zulk een universeel stelsel van bescherming van de rechten der auteurs de verbreiding van de werken des geestes zal vergemakkelijken en tot een betere internationale verstandhouding zal bijdragen;   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat verbindt zich, alle voorzieningen te treffen, welke nodig zijn om een voldoende en doeltreffende bescherming te verzekeren van de rechten van auteurs en van alle andere houders van die rechten op werken van letterkunde, wetenschap en kunst, zoals geschriften, muziekwerken, toneelwerken, cinematografische werken, schilderwerken, gravures en beeldhouwwerken.  

### Artikel  II  

1.  Openbaar gemaakte werken van onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Staat, alsook voor het eerst in het gebied van een zodanige Staat openbaar gemaakte werken, gemeten in elke andere Verdragsluitende Staat de bescherming, welke deze andere Staat toekent aan voor het eerst in zijn eigen gebied openbaar gemaakte werken van zijn onderdanen.   
2.  Niet openbaar gemaakte werken van onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Staat genieten in iedere andere Verdragsluitende Staat de bescherming, welke deze andere Staat verleent aan niet openbaar gemaakte werken van zijn eigen onderdanen.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van deze Conventie mag elke Verdragsluitende Staat door bepalingen van zijn nationale wetgeving personen, die in zijn gebied woonplaats hebben, met zijn eigen onderdanen gelijkstellen.   

### Artikel  III  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat die, ingevolge zijn nationale wetgeving, als voorwaarde voor de bescherming van de rechten der auteurs de vervulling eist van formaliteiten als nederlegging, inschrijving, vermelding, notariële verklaringen, betaling van rechten, vervaardiging of openbaarmaking in het eigen gebied, moet deze vereisten als vervuld beschouwen voor elk in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Conventie beschermd werk, dat voor het eerst is openbaar gemaakt buiten het gebied van die Staat en waarvan de auteur niet tot zijn onderdanen behoort, indien, van de eerste openbaarmaking af, alle exemplaren van het werk, openbaar gemaakt met machtiging van de auteur of van enige andere rechthebbende op het auteursrecht, het teken © dragen, vergezeld van de naam van de rechthebbende op het auteursrecht en van de aanduiding van het jaar der eerste openbaarmaking; het teken, de naam en het jaar moeten op zodanige wijze en plaats zijn aangebracht, dat het voorbehoud van het auteursrecht duidelijk blijkt.   
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel verbieden een Verdragsluitende Staat niet, de vervulling van bepaalde formaliteiten of andere voorwaarden te eisen voor de verkrijging en het genot van het auteursrecht met betrekking tot voor het eerst in zijn gebied openbaar gemaakte werken, of tot werken van zijn onderdanen onverschillig waar die zijn openbaar gemaakt.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel verbieden een Verdragsluitende Staat niet, voor te schrijven dat een procespartij voor het voeren van het proces voldoet aan regelen van rechtsvordering, zoals: dat de eiser moet worden bijgestaan door een in die Staat practiserende advocaat, dat de eiser bij de rechtbank, bij een overheidsorgaan of bij beide een exemplaar van het werk moet nederleggen, met dien verstande dat het niet voldoen aan dergelijke vereisten de geldigheid van het auteursrecht niet mag aantasten en voorts dat geen zodanig vereiste mag worden gesteld aan de onderdanen van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat, indien het niet ook is gesteld aan de onderdanen van de Staat waarin de bescherming wordt gevorderd.   
4.  In iedere Verdragsluitende Staat moeten rechtsmiddelen ter beschikking staan om zonder formaliteiten de niet openbaar gemaakte werken van onderdanen van andere Verdragsluitende Staten te beschermen.   
5.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat voor meer dan één tijdvak bescherming toekent en indien het eerste tijdvak van langere duur is dan een van de minimumtijdvakken, vermeld in artikel IV van deze Conventie, is die Staat bevoegd het eerste lid van dit artikel III niet toe te passen voor wat betreft het tweede en de eventuele volgende tijdvakken van bescherming.   

### Artikel  IV  

1.  De duur van de bescherming van een werk wordt geregeld, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel II en het onderhavige artikel, door de wet van de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de bescherming wordt gevorderd.   
2.  De duur van de bescherming der uit hoofde van deze Conventie beschermde werken mag niet korter zijn dan het leven van de auteur en 25 jaren na zijn dood. Nochtans is elke Verdragsluitende Staat die, op de datum van de inwerkingtreding van deze Conventie voor zijn gebied, deze tijdsduur voor bepaalde groepen van werken heeft beperkt tot een tijdvak gerekend van de eerste openbaarmaking van het werk af, bevoegd deze uitzonderingen te handhaven of deze uit te breiden tot andere groepen. Voor al deze groepen mag de duur der bescherming niet korter zijn dan 25 jaren sedert de dag der eerste openbaarmaking. Elke Verdragsluitende Staat die, op de datum van de inwerkingtreding van deze Conventie voor zijn gebied, de berekening van de duur der bescherming niet baseert op het leven van de auteur, is bevoegd om de duur der bescherming te berekenen sedert de datum der eerste openbaarmaking van het werk, respectievelijk sedert de aan de openbaarmaking voorafgaande inschrijving van het werk, met dien verstande dat de duur der bescherming niet korter mag zijn dan 25 jaren sedert de dag der eerste openbaarmaking, respectievelijk sedert de aan de openbaarmaking voorafgaande inschrijving van het werk. Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat voorziet in twee of meer achtereenvolgende tijdvakken van bescherming, mag de duur van het eerste tijdvak niet korter zijn dan de duur van een der hierboven bepaalde minimumtijdvakken.   
3.  De bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing op fotografische werken, noch op werken van toegepaste kunst. Echter mag in de Verdragsluitende Staten die fotografische werken en, als kunstwerken, werken van toegepaste kunst beschermen, de duur der bescherming van deze werken niet korter zijn dan tien jaar.   
4.  Geen Verdragsluitende Staat is gehouden de bescherming van een werk te verzekeren voor een langere duur dan die, welke voor de groep, waartoe het werk behoort, is vastgesteld bij de wet van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de auteur onderdaan is, indien het een niet openbaar gemaakt werk betreft, en bij de wet van de Verdragsluitende Staat waar dat werk voor het eerst is openbaar gemaakt, indien het een openbaar gemaakt werk betreft. Voor de toepassing van de vorige bepaling wordt, indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat voorziet in twee of meer achtereenvolgende tijdvakken van bescherming, de duur van de door deze Staat toegekende bescherming geacht te zijn de som van die tijdvakken. Indien echter om enigerlei reden een bepaald werk door bedoelde Staat gedurende het tweede of een der volgende tijdvakken niet wordt beschermd, zijn de andere Verdragsluitende Staten niet gehouden dat werk gedurende dat tweede of de eventuele volgende tijdvakken te beschermen.   
5.  Voor de toepassing van lid 4 van dit artikel wordt het werk van een onderdaan van een Verdragsluitende Staat, dat voor het eerst is openbaar gemaakt in een niet-Verdragsluitende Staat, geacht voor het eerst te zijn openbaar gemaakt in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de auteur onderdaan is.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van lid 4 van dit artikel wordt, in geval van gelijktijdige openbaarmaking in twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten, het werk geacht voor het eerst te zijn openbaar gemaakt in de Staat die de kortste bescherming toekent. Elk werk, dat in twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten is verschenen binnen dertig dagen na zijn eerste openbaarmaking, wordt geacht gelijktijdig te zijn openbaar gemaakt in bedoelde Verdragsluitende Staten.   

### Artikel  V  

1.  Het auteursrecht omvat het uitsluitend recht, een vertaling der uit hoofde van deze Conventie beschermde werken te vervaardigen en openbaar te maken en daartoe machtiging te verlenen.   
2.  Nochtans kan elke Verdragsluitende Staat door zijn nationale wetgeving het vertaalrecht ten opzichte van geschriften beperken, mits de volgende bepalingen in acht worden genomen: Indien, na verloop van zeven jaren sedert de eerste openbaarmaking van een geschrift, de vertaling daarvan in de landstaal, respectievelijk een der landstalen, van een Verdragsluitende Staat niet door of met machtiging van de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht is openbaar gemaakt, kan iedere onderdaan van deze Verdragsluitende Staat van de bevoegde instantie van deze Staat een licentie verkrijgen welke niet-uitsluitende rechten verleent om het werk te vertalen en het aldus vertaalde werk openbaar te maken in de landstaal waarin het niet is openbaar gemaakt. Deze licentie kan slechts worden verleend, indien de aanvrager in overeenstemming met de bepalingen, geldende in de Staat, waarin de aanvraag wordt ingediend, aantoont dat hij aan de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht machtiging tot vertalen en openbaar maken van de vertaling heeft gevraagd en dat hij, na de nodige moeite van zijn kant, de rechthebbende niet heeft kunnen bereiken of diens toestemming niet heeft kunnen verkrijgen. Op dezelfde voorwaarden kan een licentie eveneens worden verleend, indien de oplagen van een reeds in zodanige landstaal openbaar gemaakte vertaling zijn uitverkocht. Indien de aanvrager de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht niet heeft kunnen bereiken, moet hij afschriften van zijn aanvraag zenden aan de uitgever, wiens naam op het werk is vermeld en, indien de nationaliteit van de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht bekend is, aan de diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiger van de Staat, waarvan de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht onderdaan is, of aan de eventueel door de regering van deze Staat aangewezen instantie. De licentie kan niet worden verleend vóór het verstrijken van een tijdvak van twee maanden na de verzending van de afschriften der aanvraag. In de nationale wetgeving moeten doeltreffende voorzieningen worden opgenomen om aan de rechthebbende op het vertaalrecht een billijke vergoeding overeenkomstig de internationale gebruiken, alsmede de betaling en de overmaking van deze vergoeding te verzekeren, en om een juiste vertaling van het werk te waarborgen. De titel van het oorspronkelijke werk en de naam van de auteur moeten op alle exemplaren van de openbaar gemaakte vertaling worden gedrukt. De licentie is slechts geldig voor het uitgeven binnen het gebied van de Verdragsluitende Staat, waar deze licentie is aangevraagd. Invoer en verkoop van exemplaren in een andere Verdragsluitende Staat zijn mogelijk, indien deze Staat dezelfde landstaal heeft als die waarin het werk is vertaald, indien de nationale wetgeving van deze Staat zodanige licentie kent en indien geen der in deze Staat geldende bepalingen zich tegen de invoer en de verkoop verzet; de invoer en de verkoop binnen het gebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat waarin de vorengenoemde omstandigheden niet bestaan, worden voorbehouden aan de wetgeving van deze Staat en de door hem gesloten overeenkomsten. De licentie kan door de houder niet worden overgedragen. De licentie mag niet worden verleend, wanneer de auteur alle exemplaren van het werk uit het verkeer heeft genomen.   

### Artikel  VI  

Onder „openbaarmaking” in de zin van deze Conventie wordt verstaan de weergave in stoffelijke vorm en de beschikbaarstelling voor het publiek van exemplaren van het werk, waardoor men het kan lezen of het op andere wijze door aanschouwing kan waarnemen.  

### Artikel  VII  

Deze Conventie is niet van toepassing op werken of rechten op werken, welke bij het in werking treden van de Conventie in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar bescherming wordt gevorderd in die Staat voorgoed niet meer beschermd worden of daar nooit beschermd zijn geweest.  

### Artikel  VIII  

1.  Deze Conventie, die gedagtekend zal zijn 6 September 1952, zal bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur worden neder gelegd en ter ondertekening door alle Staten opengesteld blijven gedurende een tijdvak van 120 dagen na die datum. Zij zal door de ondertekenende Staten moeten worden bekrachtigd of aanvaard.   
2.  Iedere Staat die deze Conventie niet heeft ondertekend, zal tot haar kunnen toetreden.   
3.  Bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding zal geschieden door nederlegging van een daartoe strekkende akte bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur.   

### Artikel  IX  

1.  Deze Conventie zal in werking treden drie maanden na de nederlegging van twaalf akten van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding, waaronder die van vier Staten, welke niet behoren tot het Internationaal Verbond voor de bescherming van werken van letterkunde en kunst.   
2.  Nadien zal de Conventie voor iedere Staat in werking treden drie maanden na de nederlegging door die Staat van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding.   

### Artikel  X  

1.  Iedere Staat die partij is bij deze Conventie, verplicht zich, in overeenstemming met zijn Grondwet die maatregelen te nemen, welke nodig zijn om de toepassing van deze Conventie te verzekeren.   
2.  Echter moet iedere Staat op het tijdstip van nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding in staat zijn, uit hoofde van zijn nationale wetgeving, de bepalingen van deze Conventie toe te passen.   

### Artikel  XI  

1.  Er wordt een Intergouvernementele Commissie in het leven geroepen, welke de volgende taken heeft:
