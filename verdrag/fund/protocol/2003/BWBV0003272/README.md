##Protocol van 2003 bij het Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de instelling van een internationaal fonds voor vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992

####Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992

The Contracting States to the present Protocol, Bearing in mind the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 (hereinafter “the 1992 Liability Convention”), Having considered the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 (hereinafter “the 1992 Fund Convention”), Affirming the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system, Noting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 Fund Convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some Contracting States to that Convention, Recognizing that a number of Contracting States to the 1992 Liability and 1992 Fund Conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which States may accede if they so wish, Believing that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 Liability and 1992 Fund Conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim, Considering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to Contracting States to the 1992 Fund Convention,   Have agreed as follows:

2.  The Supplementary Fund shall in each Contracting State be recognized as a legal person capable under the laws of that State of assuming rights and obligations and of being a party in legal proceedings before the courts of that State.

b) to preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage.    

####SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION

### Article  4  

1.  The Supplementary Fund shall pay compensation to any person suffering pollution damage if such person has been unable to obtain full and adequate compensation for an established claim for such damage under the terms of the 1992 Fund Convention, because the total damage exceeds, or there is a risk that it will exceed, the applicable limit of compensation laid down in article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1992 Fund Convention in respect of any one incident.   
2. 
a) The aggregate amount of compensation payable by the Supplementary Fund under this article shall in respect of any one incident be limited, so that the total sum of that amount together with the amount of compensation actually paid under the 1992 Liability Convention and the 1992 Fund Convention within the scope of application of this Protocol shall not exceed 750 million units of account.  

b) The amount of 750 million units of account mentioned in paragraph 2(a) shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date determined by the Assembly of the 1992 Fund for conversion of the maximum amount payable under the 1992 Liability and 1992 Fund Conventions.     
3.  Where the amount of established claims against the Supplementary Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of compensation payable under paragraph 2, the amount available shall be distributed in such a manner that the proportion between any established claim and the amount of compensation actually recovered by the claimant under this Protocol shall be the same for all claimants.   
4.  The Supplementary Fund shall pay compensation in respect of established claims as defined in article 1, paragraph 8, and only in respect of such claims.   

### Article  5  

The Supplementary Fund shall pay compensation when the Assembly of the 1992 Fund has considered that the total amount of the established claims exceeds, or there is a risk that the total amount of established claims will exceed the aggregate amount of compensation available under article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1992 Fund Convention and that as a consequence the Assembly of the 1992 Fund has decided provisionally or finally that payments will only be made for a proportion of any established claim. The Assembly of the Supplementary Fund shall then decide whether and to what extent the Supplementary Fund shall pay the proportion of any established claim not paid under the 1992 Liability Convention and the 1992 Fund Convention.  

### Article  6  

1.  Subject to article 15, paragraphs 2 and 3, rights to compensation against the Supplementary Fund shall be extinguished only if they are extinguished against the 1992 Fund under article 6 of the 1992 Fund Convention.   
2.  A claim made against the 1992 Fund shall be regarded as a claim made by the same claimant against the Supplementary Fund.   

### Article  7  

1.  The provisions of article 7, paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, of the 1992 Fund Convention shall apply to actions for compensation brought against the Supplementary Fund in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of this Protocol.   
2.  Where an action for compensation for pollution damage has been brought before a court competent under article IX of the 1992 Liability Convention against the owner of a ship or his guarantor, such court shall have exclusive jurisdictional competence over any action against the Supplementary Fund for compensation under the provisions of article 4 of this Protocol in respect of the same damage. However, where an action for compensation for pollution damage under the 1992 Liability Convention has been brought before a court in a Contracting State to the 1992 Liability Convention but not to this Protocol, any action against the Supplementary Fund under article 4 of this Protocol shall at the option of the claimant be brought either before a court of the State where the Supplementary Fund has its headquarters or before any court of a Contracting State to this Protocol competent under article IX of the 1992 Liability Convention.   
3.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where an action for compensation for pollution damage against the 1992 Fund has been brought before a court in a Contracting State to the 1992 Fund Convention but not to this Protocol, any related action against the Supplementary Fund shall, at the option of the claimant, be brought either before a court of the State where the Supplementary Fund has its headquarters or before any court of a Contracting State competent under paragraph 1.   

### Article  8  

1.  Subject to any decision concerning the distribution referred to in article 4, paragraph 3, of this Protocol, any judgment given against the Supplementary Fund by a court having jurisdiction in accordance with article 7 of this Protocol, shall, when it has become enforceable in the State of origin and is in that State no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, be recognized and enforceable in each Contracting State on the same conditions as are prescribed in article X of the 1992 Liability Convention.   
2.  A Contracting State may apply other rules for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, provided that their effect is to ensure that judgments are recognised and enforced at least to the same extent as under paragraph 1.   

### Article  9  

1.  The Supplementary Fund shall, in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage paid by the Supplementary Fund in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of this Protocol, acquire by subrogation the rights that the person so compensated may enjoy under the 1992 Liability Convention against the owner or his guarantor.   
2.  The Supplementary Fund shall acquire by subrogation the rights that the person compensated by it may enjoy under the 1992 Fund Convention against the 1992 Fund.   
3.  Nothing in this Protocol shall prejudice any right of recourse or subrogation of the Supplementary Fund against persons other than those referred to in the preceding paragraphs. In any event the right of the Supplementary Fund to subrogation against such person shall not be less favourable than that of an insurer of the person to whom compensation has been paid.   
4.  Without prejudice to any other rights of subrogation or recourse against the Supplementary Fund which may exist, a Contracting State or agency thereof which has paid compensation for pollution damage in accordance with provisions of national law shall acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Protocol.

2.  The provisions of article 10, paragraph 2, of the 1992 Fund Convention shall apply in respect of the obligation to pay contributions to the Supplementary Fund.   

### Article  11  

1.  With a view to assessing the amount of annual contributions due, if any, and taking account of the necessity to maintain sufficient liquid funds, the Assembly shall for each calendar year make an estimate in the form of a budget of: 

(i) Expenditure 

a) costs and expenses of the administration of the Supplementary Fund in the relevant year and any deficit from operations in preceding years;

a) in so far as the contribution is for the satisfaction of payments referred to in paragraph 1(i)a) on the basis of a fixed sum for each ton of contributing oil received in the relevant State by such person during the preceding calendar year; and  

b) in so far as the contribution is for the satisfaction of payments referred to in paragraph 1(i)b) on the basis of a fixed sum for each ton of contributing oil received by such person during the calendar year preceding that in which the incident in question occurred, provided that State was a Contracting State to this Protocol at the date of the incident.     
3.  The sums referred to in paragraph 2 shall be arrived at by dividing the relevant total amount of contributions required by the total amount of contributing oil received in all Contracting States in the relevant year.   
4.  The annual contribution shall be due on the date to be laid down in the Internal Regulations of the Supplementary Fund. The Assembly may decide on a different date of payment.   
5.  The Assembly may decide, under conditions to be laid down in the Financial Regulations of the Supplementary Fund, to make transfers between funds received in accordance with paragraph 2a) and funds received in accordance with paragraph 2b)

2.  Where a Contracting State does not fulfil its obligations to submit the communication referred to in paragraph 1 and this results in a financial loss for the Supplementary Fund, that Contracting State shall be liable to compensate the Supplementary Fund for such loss. The Assembly shall, on the recommendation of the Director of the Supplementary Fund, decide whether such compensation shall be payable by that Contracting State.   

### Article  14  

1.  Notwithstanding article 10, for the purposes of this Protocol there shall be deemed to be a minimum receipt of 1 million tons of contributing oil in each Contracting State.

When the aggregate quantity of contributing oil received in a Contracting State is less than 1 million tons, the Contracting State shall assume the obligations that would be incumbent under this Protocol on any person who would be liable to contribute to the Supplementary Fund in respect of oil received within the territory of that State in so far as no liable person exists for the aggregated quantity of oil received.   

### Article  15  

1.  If in a Contracting State there is no person meeting the conditions of article 10, that Contracting State shall for the purposes of this Protocol inform the Director of the Supplementary Fund thereof.   
2.  No compensation shall be paid by the Supplementary Fund for pollution damage in the territory, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone or area determined in accordance with article 3a)(ii), of this Protocol, of a Contracting State in respect of a given incident or for preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage, until the obligations to communicate to the Director of the Supplementary Fund according to article 13, paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 of this article have been complied with in respect of that Contracting State for all years prior to the occurrence of that incident.  The Assembly shall determine in the Internal Regulations the circumstances under which a Contracting State shall be considered as having failed to comply with its obligations.  
3.  Where compensation has been denied temporarily in accordance with paragraph 2, compensation shall be denied permanently in respect of that incident if the obligations to communicate to the Director of the Supplementary Fund under article 13, paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 of this article, have not been complied with within one year after the Director of the Supplementary Fund has notified the Contracting State of its failure to report.   
4.  Any payments of contributions due to the Supplementary Fund shall be set off against compensation due to the debtor, or the debtor's agents.

De Verdragsluitende Staten die partij zijn bij dit Protocol, Indachtig het Internationaal Verdrag inzake de wettelijke aansprakelijkheid voor schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992 (hierna „het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992”), Bestudeerd hebbend het Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de instelling van een Internationaal Fonds voor vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992 (hierna „het Fondsverdrag, 1992”), Het belang bevestigend van de handhaving van de levensvatbaarheid van het internationale stelsel van aansprakelijkheid voor verontreiniging door olie en van vergoeding van schade, Vaststellend dat het door het Fondsverdrag, 1992, toegekende maximumbedrag aan vergoeding onder bepaalde omstandigheden in een aantal Verdragsluitende Staten die partij zijn bij dat verdrag, niet toereikend zou kunnen zijn voor de vergoeding van de schade, Erkennend dat een aantal Verdragsluitende Staten bij het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, en het Fondsverdrag, 1992, het noodzakelijk achten de hoogste prioriteit te geven aan het beschikbaar stellen van bijkomende gelden voor schadevergoeding door de instelling van een aanvullend stelsel waartoe Staten kunnen toetreden indien zij dit wensen, Ervan overtuigd dat het aanvullend stelsel erop gericht moet zijn te waarborgen dat personen die schade hebben geleden door verontreiniging door olie volledig schadeloos worden gesteld voor hun verliezen of schade, en tevens voor verlichting moet zorgen van de problemen waarmee slachtoffers worden geconfronteerd in gevallen waarin het bedrag dat uit hoofde van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, en het Fondsverdrag, 1992, beschikbaar is voor schadevergoeding niet toereikend dreigt te zijn om erkende vorderingen volledig te betalen en dat dientengevolge het Internationaal Fonds voor vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992, voorlopig heeft besloten dat het slechts een deel van de erkende vordering zal betalen, Overwegend dat toetreding tot het aanvullend stelsel uitsluitend open staat voor Verdragsluitende Staten die partij zijn bij het Fondsverdrag, 1992,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

b. op preventieve maatregelen, waar ook genomen, ter voorkoming of ter beperking van dergelijke schade.    

####AANVULLENDE VERGOEDING

### Artikel  4  

1.  Het Aanvullend Fonds betaalt schadevergoeding aan iedere persoon die schade door verontreiniging heeft geleden indien deze persoon niet in staat is geweest volledige en passende vergoeding van een erkende vordering voor dergelijke schade te verkrijgen uit hoofde van de bepalingen van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, omdat de totale schade de van toepassing zijnde vergoedingsgrens zoals vervat in artikel 4, vierde lid, van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, ten aanzien van een voorval overtreft, of dreigt te overtreffen.   
2.  

a. Het totale bedrag dat door het Aanvullend Fonds als vergoeding ingevolge dit artikel per voorval moet worden uitgekeerd, is in dier voege beperkt dat de som van dit bedrag en het bedrag dat werkelijk als vergoeding ingevolge het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, en het Fondsverdrag, 1992, binnen het toepassingsgebied van dit Protocol wordt uitbetaald, niet meer bedraagt dan 750 miljoen rekeneenheden.  

b. Het in het tweede lid, onderdeel a, genoemde bedrag van 750 miljoen rekeneenheden wordt omgerekend in een nationale munteenheid volgens de waarde van die munteenheid ten opzichte van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht op de datum van het besluit van de Algemene Vergadering van het Fonds 1992 aangaande de omrekening van het maximumbedrag dat ingevolge het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, en het Fondsverdrag, 1992, moet worden uitgekeerd.     
3.  Wanneer het bedrag van erkende vorderingen tegen het Aanvullend Fonds het totale bedrag dat ingevolge het tweede lid betaald moet worden te boven gaat, wordt het bedrag dat beschikbaar is zodanig verdeeld dat de verhouding tussen een erkende vordering en het bedrag aan vergoeding dat de schuldeiser daadwerkelijk krijgt toegewezen uit hoofde van dit Protocol voor alle schuldeisers hetzelfde is.   
4.  Door het Aanvullend Fonds worden uitsluitend schadevergoedingen betaald betreffende erkende vorderingen zoals omschreven in artikel 1, achtste lid.   

### Artikel  5  

Het Aanvullend Fonds betaalt schadevergoeding wanneer de Algemene Vergadering van het Fonds 1992 van mening is dat het totale bedrag van de erkende vorderingen het totale bedrag dat beschikbaar is voor schadevergoeding ingevolge artikel 4, vierde lid, van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zal overschrijden of dreigt te overschrijden, en dat dientengevolge de Algemene Vergadering van het Fonds 1992 het voorlopige of definitieve besluit heeft genomen dat slechts een deel van de erkende vordering zal worden betaald. De Algemene Vergadering van het Aanvullend Fonds besluit in dat geval of en in welke mate het Aanvullend Fonds het gedeelte van de erkende vordering zal betalen dat niet wordt betaald uit hoofde van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, en het Fondsverdrag, 1992.  

### Artikel  6  

1.  Met inachtneming van artikel 15, tweede en derde lid, vervallen rechten op schadevergoeding jegens het Aanvullend Fonds uitsluitend indien zij ook vervallen jegens het Fonds 1992 ingevolge artikel 6 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992.   
2.  Een vordering ingesteld tegen het Fonds 1992 wordt beschouwd als een vordering die door dezelfde eiser is ingesteld tegen het Aanvullend Fonds.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  De bepalingen van artikel 7, eerste, tweede, vierde, vijfde en zesde lid, van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zijn van toepassing op vorderingen tot vergoeding van schade ingesteld tegen het Aanvullend Fonds overeenkomstig artikel 4, eerste lid, van dit Protocol.   
2.  Indien tegen een scheepseigenaar of zijn garant een vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging bij de op grond van artikel IX van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, bevoegde rechter is ingesteld, is deze rechter bij uitsluiting bevoegd kennis te nemen van een vordering betreffende dezelfde schade tegen het Aanvullend Fonds tot vergoeding ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel 4 van dit Protocol. Indien echter een vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging op grond van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, is ingesteld bij de rechter van een Verdragsluitende Staat die wel partij is bij het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, doch niet bij dit Protocol, moet een vordering tegen het Aanvullend Fonds ingevolge artikel 4 van dit Protocol, ter keuze van de schuldeiser, worden ingesteld hetzij bij de rechter van de Staat waar het Aanvullend Fonds zijn zetel heeft, hetzij bij een ingevolge artikel IX van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, bevoegde rechter van een Verdragsluitende Staat die partij is bij dit Protocol.   
3.  Indien, niettegenstaande het eerste lid, een vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging tegen het Fonds 1992, is ingesteld bij de rechter van een Verdragsluitende Staat die partij is bij het Fondsverdrag, 1992, doch niet bij dit Protocol, moet een samenhangende vordering tegen het Aanvullend Fonds, ter keuze van de schuldeiser, worden ingesteld hetzij bij de rechter van de Staat waar het Aanvullend Fonds zijn zetel heeft, hetzij bij een ingevolge het eerste lid bevoegde rechter van een Verdragsluitende Staat.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Met inachtneming van een besluit omtrent de verdeling bedoeld in artikel 4, derde lid, van dit Protocol, worden uitspraken betreffende het Aanvullend Fonds van een overeenkomstig artikel 7 van dit Protocol bevoegde rechter, wanneer deze voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar zijn geworden in de Staat waar zij zijn gedaan en waartegen in die Staat geen gewoon rechtsmiddel meer openstaat, in elke Verdragsluitende Staat erkend en voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar op dezelfde voorwaarden als die vervat in artikel X van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan andere regels toepassen voor de erkenning en tenuitvoerlegging van rechterlijke uitspraken, mits deze ertoe strekken te waarborgen dat uitspraken in ten minste dezelfde mate als ingevolge het eerste lid worden erkend of ten uitvoer worden gelegd.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Het Aanvullend Fonds treedt voor elk bedrag dat het aan vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging op grond van artikel 4, eerste lid, van dit Protocol heeft betaald, bij wege van subrogatie in de rechten die de persoon wiens schade aldus is vergoed, op grond van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1992, zou kunnen doen gelden ten aanzien van de eigenaar of zijn garant.   
2.  Het Aanvullend Fonds treedt bij wege van subrogatie in de rechten die de persoon wiens schade door hem is vergoed, op grond van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zou kunnen doen gelden ten aanzien van het Fonds 1992.   
3.  Niets in dit Protocol tast enig recht op verhaal of subrogatie aan dat het Aanvullend Fonds kan doen gelden ten aanzien van andere personen dan die bedoeld in de voorgaande leden. In elk geval zal het recht dat het Aanvullend Fonds bij wege van subrogatie ten aanzien van een dergelijke persoon heeft, ten minste gelijkwaardig zijn aan dat van een verzekeraar van de persoon aan wie de schadevergoeding is betaald.   
4.  Onverminderd elk ander recht van subrogatie of verhaal op het Aanvullend Fonds, treedt een Verdragsluitende Staat die, of een orgaan van deze Staat dat vergoeding heeft betaald voor schade door verontreiniging overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de wet van deze Staat, bij wege van subrogatie in de rechten die de persoon wiens schade aldus is vergoed, op grond van dit Protocol zou hebben gehad.   

####BIJDRAGEN

### Artikel  10  

1.  Voor elke Verdragsluitende Staat worden aan het Aanvullend Fonds jaarlijks bijdragen betaald door iedere persoon die, in het kalenderjaar bedoeld in artikel 11, tweede lid, onderdeel a of b, bijdragende olie heeft ontvangen in hoeveelheden die in totaal meer dan 150.000 ton bedragen, en wel: 

a. bijdragende olie die over zee is aangevoerd in havens of laad- en losinstallaties op het grondgebied van die Staat; en  

b. bijdragende olie die is ontvangen in enige installatie op het grondgebied van die Verdragsluitende Staat en die over zee is vervoerd en gelost in een haven of een laad- of losinstallatie van een niet-Verdragsluitende Staat, evenwel met dien verstande dat bijdragende olie eerst dan in aanmerking wordt genomen ingevolge dit onderdeel, wanneer deze voor de eerste maal wordt ontvangen in een Verdragsluitende Staat na te zijn gelost in die niet-Verdragsluitende Staat.     
2.  Het bepaalde in artikel 10, tweede lid, van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, is van toepassing ten aanzien van de verplichting bij te dragen aan het Aanvullend Fonds.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  Ter bepaling van het bedrag dat eventueel verschuldigd is aan jaarlijkse bijdragen, stelt de Algemene Vergadering, rekening houdend met de noodzaak van het beschikbaar zijn van voldoende liquide middelen, voor elk jaar een voorlopige begroting op van: 

i. Uitgaven 

a. kosten en uitgaven van de administratie van het Aanvullend Fonds in het desbetreffende jaar en tekorten voortvloeiend uit verrichtingen in voorafgaande jaren;  

b. door het Aanvullend Fonds in het desbetreffende jaar te verrichten betalingen ter voldoening van vergoedingen, verschuldigd ingevolge artikel 4, daaronder begrepen terugbetaling van leningen die het Aanvullend Fonds eerder ter voldoening van dergelijke vergoedingen is aangegaan.    

ii. Inkomsten 

a. overschotten uit verrichtingen in voorgaande jaren, met inbegrip van eventuele renten;  

b. jaarlijkse bijdragen, die nodig mochten zijn om een sluitende begroting te verkrijgen;  

c. andere inkomsten.       
2.  De Algemene Vergadering besluit over het te heffen totale bedrag aan bijdragen. Op basis van dat besluit berekent de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds, ten aanzien van elke Verdragsluitende Staat, voor elke persoon bedoeld in artikel 10 het bedrag van diens jaarlijkse bijdrage: 

a. indien het een bijdrage betreft ter voldoening van betalingen bedoeld in het eerste lid, onderdeel i, a, op basis van een vast bedrag voor elke ton bijdragende olie die is ontvangen in de desbetreffende Staat door deze persoon gedurende het voorgaande kalenderjaar; en  

b. indien het een bijdrage betreft ter voldoening van betalingen als bedoeld in het eerste lid, onderdeel 1, b, op basis van een vast bedrag voor elke ton bijdragende olie die is ontvangen door deze persoon gedurende het kalenderjaar dat voorafgaat aan dat waarin het desbetreffende voorval heeft plaatsgevonden, mits die Staat op de datum van het voorval Partij was bij dit Protocol.     
3.  De bedragen bedoeld in het tweede lid worden berekend door het totaal van de verschuldigde bijdragen te delen door de totale hoeveelheid bijdragende olie die in het desbetreffende jaar is ontvangen in alle Verdragsluitende Staten.   
4.  De jaarlijkse bijdrage is verschuldigd op de datum te bepalen in het huishoudelijk reglement van het Aanvullend Fonds. De Algemene Vergadering kan tot een andere betalingsdatum besluiten.   
5.  De Algemene Vergadering kan, op de voorwaarden te bepalen in het financiële reglement van het Aanvullend Fonds, besluiten overschrijvingen te verrichten tussen gelden ontvangen overeenkomstig het tweede lid, onderdeel a, en gelden ontvangen overeenkomstig het tweede lid, onderdeel b.   

### Artikel  12  

1.  De bepalingen van artikel 13 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zijn van toepassing op de bijdragen aan het Aanvullend Fonds.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan zelf de verplichting op zich nemen bijdragen te betalen aan het Aanvullend Fonds overeenkomstig de procedure vervat in artikel 14 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten doen de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds mededeling van ontvangsten van olie overeenkomstig artikel 15 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, echter met dien verstande dat mededelingen aan de Directeur van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, uit hoofde van artikel 15, tweede lid, van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, geacht worden tevens uit hoofde van dit Protocol te zijn gedaan.   
2.  Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Staat niet voldoet aan zijn verplichtingen de Directeur de in het eerste lid bedoelde mededeling te doen en zulks leidt tot een financieel verlies voor het Aanvullend Fonds, is die Verdragsluitende Staat verplicht dit verlies aan het Aanvullend Fonds te vergoeden. De Algemene Vergadering besluit, op aanbeveling van de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds, of een Verdragsluitende Staat een dergelijke vergoeding dient te betalen.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Niettegenstaande artikel 10 wordt elke Verdragsluitende Staat, voor de toepassing van dit Protocol, geacht ten minste 1 miljoen ton bijdragende olie te ontvangen.   
2.  Wanneer de totale hoeveelheid bijdragende olie die in een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt ontvangen minder bedraagt dan 1 miljoen ton, neemt de Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichtingen op zich die uit hoofde van dit Protocol zouden rusten op iedere persoon die verplicht zou zijn aan het Aanvullend Fonds bij te dragen ten aanzien van olie die op het grondgebied van die Staat is ontvangen, voor zover er geen persoon is die aansprakelijk is voor de totale hoeveelheid ontvangen olie.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Indien er in een Verdragsluitende Staat geen persoon is die voldoet aan de voorwaarden vervat in artikel 10, stelt die Verdragsluitende Staat voor de toepassing van dit Protocol de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds hiervan op de hoogte.   
2.  Het Aanvullend Fonds betaalt geen vergoeding voor schade door verontreiniging op het grondgebied, in de territoriale zee of exclusieve economische zone of in een overeenkomstig artikel 3, onderdeel a, ii, van dit Protocol vastgesteld gebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat ten aanzien van een bepaald voorval of preventieve maatregelen, waar ook genomen, ter voorkoming of beperking van dergelijke schade, totdat aan de verplichting tot mededeling aan de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds uit hoofde van artikel 13, eerste lid en het eerste lid van dit artikel, is voldaan ten aanzien van die Verdragsluitende Staat met betrekking tot alle jaren voorafgaand aan het plaatsvinden van dat voorval.  De Algemene Vergadering stelt in haar huishoudelijk reglement de omstandigheden vast waaronder een Verdragsluitende Staat geacht wordt niet aan zijn verplichtingen te hebben voldaan.  
3.  Wanneer vergoeding tijdelijk is geweigerd overeenkomstig het tweede lid, wordt vergoeding definitief geweigerd ten aanzien van dat voorval indien niet wordt voldaan aan de verplichting tot mededeling aan de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds uit hoofde van artikel 13, eerste lid en het eerste lid van dit artikel, binnen een jaar nadat de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds de Verdragsluitende Staat ervan in kennis heeft gesteld dat niet aan de verplichting tot mededeling is voldaan.   
4.  Betalingen van bijdragen die verschuldigd zijn aan het Aanvullend Fonds worden verrekend met de vergoeding die aan de schuldenaar of diens vertegenwoordigers verschuldigd is.   

####ORGANISATIE EN ADMINISTRATIE

### Artikel  16  

1.  Het Aanvullend Fonds heeft een Algemene Vergadering en een Secretariaat onder leiding van een Directeur.   
2.  De artikelen 17 tot en met 20 en 28 tot en met 32 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zijn van toepassing op de Algemene Vergadering, het Secretariaat en de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds.   
3.  Artikel 34 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, is van toepassing op het Aanvullend Fonds.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  Het Secretariaat van het Fonds 1992, en de Directeur die het Fonds 1992 leidt, kunnen tevens fungeren als het Secretariaat en de Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds.   
2.  Indien, overeenkomstig het eerste lid, het Secretariaat en de Directeur van het Fonds 1992, tevens de taken uitvoeren van Secretariaat en Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds, wordt het Aanvullend Fonds, in gevallen van strijdigheid van belangen tussen het Fonds 1992 en het Aanvullend Fonds, vertegenwoordigd door de Voorzitter van de Algemene Vergadering.   
3.  De Directeur van het Aanvullend Fonds, het door hem aangestelde personeel en de door hem benoemde deskundigen, die hun taken uitvoeren ingevolge dit Protocol en het Fondsverdrag, 1992, worden niet geacht de bepalingen van artikel 30 van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, zoals toegepast door artikel 16, tweede lid, van dit Protocol te overtreden, voor zover zij hun taken uitoefenen overeenkomstig dit artikel.   
4.  De Algemene Vergadering tracht geen besluiten te nemen die onverenigbaar zijn met de besluiten genomen door de Algemene Vergadering van het Fonds 1992. Indien zich verschillen van mening met betrekking tot gemeenschappelijke administratieve kwesties voordoen, poogt de Algemene Vergadering in een geest van onderlinge samenwerking en met de gemeenschappelijke doelstellingen van beide organisaties voor ogen overeenstemming te bereiken met de Algemene Vergadering van het Fonds 1992.   
5.  Het Aanvullend Fonds vergoedt aan het Fonds 1992, alle kosten en uitgaven voortvloeiend uit administratieve diensten door het Fonds 1992 namens het Aanvullend Fonds verricht.   

####OVERGANGSBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  18  

1.  Behoudens het vierde lid, is het totale bedrag van de verschuldigde jaarlijkse bijdragen ten aanzien van bijdragende olie ontvangen in één Verdragsluitende Staat gedurende een kalenderjaar niet hoger dan 20% van het totale bedrag van de jaarlijkse bijdragen ingevolge dit Protocol met betrekking tot dat kalenderjaar.   
2.  Indien de toepassing van het bepaalde in artikel 11, tweede en derde lid, ertoe zou leiden dat het totale bedrag van de door de bijdrageplichtigen in één Verdragsluitende Staat met betrekking tot een bepaald kalenderjaar verschuldigde jaarlijkse bijdragen meer bedraagt dan 20% van de totale jaarlijkse bijdragen, dan worden de door de bijdragenplichtigen in die Staat verschuldigde bijdragen naar evenredigheid verlaagd zodat het totaal van hun bijdragen gelijk is aan 20% van de totale jaarlijkse bijdragen aan het Aanvullend Fonds met betrekking tot dat jaar.   
3.  Indien de door personen in een bepaalde Verdragsluitende Staat verschuldigde bijdragen worden verlaagd ingevolge het tweede lid, dan worden de door personen in alle andere Verdragsluitende Staten verschuldigde bijdragen naar evenredigheid verhoogd, teneinde te verzekeren dat het totale bedrag van de bijdragen verschuldigd door alle personen die met betrekking tot het kalenderjaar in kwestie verplicht zijn aan het Aanvullend Fonds bij te dragen het totale bedrag aan bijdragen bereikt dat de Algemene Vergadering heeft vastgesteld.   
4.  Het bepaalde in het eerste tot en met het derde lid is van toepassing totdat de totale hoeveelheid bijdragende olie die in een kalenderjaar is ontvangen in alle Verdragsluitende Staten, met inbegrip van de in artikel 14, eerste lid, genoemde hoeveelheden, 1.000 miljoen ton heeft bereikt, of totdat een periode van 10 jaar na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol is verstreken, al naar gelang van hetgeen zich het eerst voordoet.

Wijzigingen worden aangenomen met een meerderheid van tweederde van de Verdragsluitende Staten die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen in de Juridische Commissie, welke is uitgebreid zoals bepaald in het derde lid, mits ten minste de helft van de Verdragsluitende Staten aanwezig is op het tijdstip van de stemming.   
5.  Wanneer de Juridische Commissie een voorstel tot wijziging van de grens bespreekt, houdt zij rekening met de ervaring opgedaan bij voorvallen en in het bijzonder met het bedrag van de daaruit voortvloeiende schade alsmede met wijzigingen in geldswaarden.   
6.  

a. Geen wijziging van de grens ingevolge dit artikel mag worden overwogen vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol en evenmin binnen drie jaar vanaf de datum van inwerkingtreding van een voorgaande wijziging ingevolge dit artikel.  

b. Geen grens mag zodanig worden verhoogd dat deze een bedrag overschrijdt dat overeenkomt met de grens vervat in dit Protocol, verhoogd met zes procent per jaar berekend op samengestelde basis vanaf de datum waarop dit Protocol is opengesteld voor ondertekening tot en met de datum waarop de beslissing van de Juridische Commissie in werking treedt.  

c. Geen grens mag zodanig worden verhoogd dat deze een bedrag overschrijdt dat overeenkomt met de grens vervat in dit Protocol vermenigvuldigd met drie.     
7.  Elke wijziging aangenomen overeenkomstig het vierde lid wordt door de Organisatie ter kennis gebracht van alle Verdragsluitende Staten. De wijziging wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard aan het einde van een tijdvak van twaalf maanden na de datum van kennisgeving, tenzij binnen dat tijdvak niet minder dan eenvierde van de Staten die Verdragsluitende Staten waren op het tijdstip van aanneming van de wijziging door de Juridische Commissie de Organisatie hebben medegedeeld dat zij de wijziging niet aanvaarden, in welk geval de wijziging is verworpen en deze niet van kracht wordt.   
8.  Een wijziging die geacht wordt te zijn aanvaard overeenkomstig het zevende lid, treedt in werking twaalf maanden na aanvaarding ervan.   
9.  Alle Verdragsluitende Staten zijn gebonden door de wijziging, tenzij zij ten minste zes maanden voordat de wijziging in werking treedt dit Protocol opzeggen overeenkomstig artikel 26, eerste en tweede lid. Een dergelijke opzegging wordt van kracht wanneer de wijziging in werking treedt.   
10.  Wanneer een wijziging door de Juridische Commissie is aangenomen, maar het tijdvak van twaalf maanden voor de aanvaarding ervan nog niet is verstreken, is een Staat die gedurende dat tijdvak een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt, door de wijziging gebonden indien deze in werking treedt. Een Staat die na dat tijdvak een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt, is gebonden door een wijziging die overeenkomstig het zevende lid is aanvaard. In de gevallen bedoeld in dit lid wordt een Staat gebonden door een wijziging wanneer deze wijziging in werking treedt, of wanneer dit Protocol voor die Staat in werking treedt, indien deze datum later valt.   

### Artikel  25  

####Protocollen bij het Fondsverdrag, 1992

1.  Indien de grenzen vervat in het Fondsverdrag, 1992, ingevolge een Protocol daarbij zijn verhoogd, mag de grens vervat in artikel 4, tweede lid, onderdeel a, met hetzelfde bedrag worden verhoogd door middel van de in artikel 24 vervatte procedure. De bepalingen van artikel 24, zesde lid, zijn in deze gevallen niet van toepassing.   
2.  Indien de in het eerste lid genoemde procedure is toegepast, wordt een daaropvolgende wijziging van de in artikel 4, tweede lid, vervatte grens, door toepassing van de procedure in artikel 24, voor de toepassing van artikel 24, zesde lid, onderdeel b en c, berekend op basis van de nieuwe grens zoals ingevolge het eerste lid verhoogd.

3.  Een opzegging wordt van kracht twaalf maanden na nederlegging van de akte van opzegging bij de Secretaris-Generaal of na een langere termijn wanneer deze in die akte is bepaald.   
4.  Opzegging van het Fondsverdrag, 1992, wordt beschouwd als opzegging van dit Protocol. Een dergelijke opzegging wordt van kracht op de datum waarop de opzegging van het Protocol van 1992 tot wijziging van het Fondsverdrag, 1971, van kracht wordt overeenkomstig artikel 34 van dat Protocol.   
5.  Niettegenstaande een opzegging van dit Protocol door een Verdragsluitende Staat ingevolge dit artikel blijven de bepalingen van dit Protocol welke verband houden met de verplichtingen om bij te dragen aan het Aanvullend Fonds van toepassing ten aanzien van een voorval zoals bedoeld in artikel 11, tweede lid, onderdeel b, dat zich heeft voorgedaan voordat de opzegging van kracht wordt.

3.  Indien de Algemene Vergadering, in een buitengewone zitting bijeengeroepen overeenkomstig het eerste of het tweede lid, besluit dat de opzegging zal leiden tot een belangrijke stijging van de bijdragen voor de overblijvende Verdragsluitende Staten, kan elk van deze Staten uiterlijk honderdtwintig dagen voor de datum waarop de opzegging van kracht wordt, dit Protocol opzeggen met ingang van dezelfde datum.
