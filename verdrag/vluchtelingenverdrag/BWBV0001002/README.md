##Verdrag betreffende de status van vluchtelingen

####CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES

*Preamble*  The High Contracting Parties, Considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination, Considering that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavoured to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms, Considering that it is desirable to revise and consolidate previous international agreements relating to the status of refugees and to extend the scope of and the protection accorded by such instruments by means of a new agreement, Considering that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, and that a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation, Expressing the wish that all States, recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees, will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between States, Noting that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervising international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and recognizing that the effective co-ordination of measures taken to deal with this problem will depend upon the co-operation of States with the High Commissioner, Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####General Provisions

### Article  1  

####Definition of the Term "Refugee"

A.  For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "refugee" shall apply to any person who: 

(1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May 1926 and 30 June 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization; Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section;  

(2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.   In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term "the country of his nationality" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.   
B.  

(1) For the purposes of this Convention, the words "events occurring before 1 January 1951" in article 1, section A, shall be understood to mean either 

(a) "events occurring in Europe before 1 January 1951"; or  

(b) "events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before 1 January 1951"; and each Contracting State shall make a declaration at the time of signature, ratification or accession, specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this Convention.    

(2) Any Contracting State which has adopted alternative (*a*) may at any time extend its obligations by adopting alternative (*b*) by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.     
C.  This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: 

(1) He has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or  

(2) Having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily reacquired it; or  

(3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or  

(4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or  

(5) He can no longer, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality;  

(6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the country of his former habitual residence; Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to return to the country of his former habitual residence.     
D.  This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance. When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitively settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, these persons shall *ipso facto* be entitled to the benefits of this Convention.   
E.  This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.   
F.  The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: 

(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;  

(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;  

(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

5.  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 apply both to the rights and benefits referred to in articles 13, 18, 19, 21 and 22 of this Convention and to rights and benefits for which this Convention does not provide.   

### Article  8  

####Exemption from Exceptional Measures

With regard to exceptional measures which may be taken against the person, property or interests of nationals of a foreign State, the Contracting States shall not apply such measures to a refugee who is formally a national of the said State solely on account of such nationality.

### Article  10  

####Continuity of Residence

1.  Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War and removed to the territory of a Contracting State, and is resident there, the period of such enforced sojourn shall be considered to have been lawful residence within that territory.

###IV

The Conference adopted unanimously the following recommendations: 

A "The Conference, "Considering that the issue and recognition of travel documents is necessary to facilitate the movement of refugees, and in particular their resettlement, "Urges Governments which are parties to the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Refugee Travel Documents signed in London on 15 October 1946, or which recognize travel documents issued in accordance with the Agreement, to continue to issue or to recognize such travel documents, and to extend the issue of such documents to refugees as defined in article 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or to recognize the travel documents so issued to such persons, until they shall have undertaken obligations under article 28 of the said Convention."  

B 'The Conference, "Considering that the unity of the family, the natural and fundamental group unit of society, is an essential right of the refugee, and that such unity is constantly threatened, and "Noting with satisfaction that, according to the official commentary of the *ad hoc* Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems (E/1618, p. 40) the rights granted to a refugee are extended to members of his family, "Recommends Governments to take the necessary measures for the protection of the refugee's family, especially with a view to: 

"(1) Ensuring that the unity of the refugee's family is maintained particularly in cases where the head of the family has fulfilled the necessary conditions for admission to a particular country;  

"(2) The protection of refugees who are minors, in particular unaccompanied children and girls, with special reference to guardianship and adoption."    

C "The Conference, "Considering that, in the moral, legal and material spheres, refugees need the help of suitable welfare services, especially that of appropriate non-governmental organizations; "Recommends Governments and intergovernmental bodies to facilitate, encourage and sustain the efforts of properly qualified organizations."  

D "The Conference, "Considering that many persons still leave their country of origin for reasons of persecution and are entitled to special protection on account of their position, "Recommends that Governments continue to receive refugees in their territories and that they act in concert in a true spirit of international co-operation in order that these refugees may find asylum and the possibility of resettlement."  

E "The Conference, "Expresses the hope that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees will have value as an example exceeding its contractual scope and that all nations will be guided by it in granting so far as possible to persons in their territory as refugees and who would not be covered by the terms of the Convention, the treatment for which it provides."   IN WITNESS WHEREOF the President, Vice-Presidents and the Executive Secretary of the Conference have signed this Final Act.   
DONE at Geneva this twenty-eighth day of July one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one in a single copy in the English and French languages, each text being equally authentic.

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  1  

####Definitie van de term „vluchteling"

A.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag geldt als „vluchteling" elke persoon: 

(1) Die krachtens de Regelingen van 12 Mei 1926 en 30 Juni 1928 of krachtens de Overeenkomsten van 28 October 1933 en 10 Februari 1938, het Protocol van 14 September 1939 of het Statuut van de Internationale Vluchtelingenorganisatie als vluchteling werd beschouwd. De door de Internationale Vluchtelingenorganisatie gedurende haar mandaat genomen beslissingen waarbij personen niet in aanmerking werden gebracht voor de bescherming en de hulp van die organisatie, vormen geen belemmering voor het verlenen van de status van vluchteling aan personen die aan de voorwaarden van lid 2 van deze afdeling voldoen;  

(2) Die, ten gevolge van gebeurtenissen welke vóór 1 Januari 1951 hebben plaats gevonden, en uit gegronde vrees voor vervolging wegens zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, het behoren tot een bepaalde sociale groep of zijn politieke overtuiging, zich bevindt buiten het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, en die de bescherming van dat land niet kan of, uit hoofde van bovenbedoelde vrees, niet wil inroepen, of die, indien hij geen nationaliteit bezit en ten gevolge van bovenbedoelde gebeurtenissen verblijft buiten het land waar hij vroeger zijn gewone verblijfplaats had, daarheen niet kan of, uit hoofde van bovenbedoelde vrees, niet wil terugkeren.   Indien een persoon meer dan één nationaliteit bezit, betekent de term „het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit" elk van de landen waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit. Een persoon wordt niet geacht van de bescherming van het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, verstoken te zijn, indien hij, zonder geldige redenen ingegeven door gegronde vrees, de bescherming van één van de landen waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, niet inroept.   
B.  

(1) Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag betekenen in artikel 1, afdeling A, de woorden „gebeurtenissen welke vóór 1 Januari 1951 hebben plaats gevonden" hetzij 

(a) „gebeurtenissen welke vóór 1 Januari 1951 in Europa hebben plaats gevonden"; hetzij  

(b) „gebeurtenissen welke vóór 1 Januari 1951 in Europa of elders hebben plaats gevonden";   elke Verdragsluitende Staat zal bij de ondertekening, bekrachtiging of toetreding een verklaring afleggen, waarin wordt te kennen gegeven, welke van deze omschrijvingen hij voornemens is toe te passen met betrekking tot zijn verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag.  

(2) Elke Verdragsluitende Staat die de omschrijving *(a)* heeft aanvaard, kan te allen tijde door middel van een kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties zijn verplichtingen uitbreiden door omschrijving *(b)* te aanvaarden.     
C.  Dit Verdrag houdt op van toepassing te zijn op elke persoon die valt onder de bepalingen van afdeling A, indien: 

(1) Hij vrijwillig wederom de bescherming inroept van het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit;  

(2) Hij, indien hij zijn nationaliteit had verloren, deze vrijwillig heeft herkregen;  

(3) Hij een nieuwe nationaliteit heeft verkregen en de bescherming geniet van het land waarvan hij de nieuwe nationaliteit bezit;  

(4) Hij zich vrijwillig opnieuw heeft gevestigd in het land dat hij had verlaten of waarbuiten hij uit vrees voor vervolging verblijf hield;  

(5) Hij niet langer kan blijven weigeren de bescherming van het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, in te roepen, omdat de omstandigheden in verband waarmede hij was erkend als vluchteling, hebben opgehouden te bestaan; Met dien verstande echter, dat dit lid niet van toepassing is op een vluchteling die onder lid 1 van afdeling A van dit artikel valt, en die dwingende redenen, voortvloeiende uit vroegere vervolging, kan aanvoeren om te weigeren de bescherming van het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, in te roepen;  

(6) Hij, indien hij geen nationaliteit bezit, kan terugkeren naar het land waar hij vroeger zijn gewone verblijfplaats had, omdat de omstandigheden in verband waarmede hij was erkend als vluchteling, hebben opgehouden te bestaan; Met dien verstande echter, dat dit lid niet van toepassing is op een vluchteling die onder lid 1 van afdeling A van dit artikel valt, en die dwingende redenen, voortvloeiende uit vroegere vervolging, kan aanvoeren om te weigeren naar het land waar hij vroeger zijn gewone verblijfplaats had, terug te keren.     
D.  Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op personen die thans bescherming of bijstand genieten van andere organen of instellingen van de Verenigde Naties dan van de Hoge Commissaris van de Verenigde Naties voor de Vluchtelingen. Wanneer deze bescherming of bijstand om welke reden ook is opgehouden, zonder dat de positie van zodanige personen definitief geregeld is in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende resoluties van de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties, zullen deze personen van rechtswege onder dit Verdrag vallen.   
E.  Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op een persoon die door de bevoegde autoriteiten van het land waar hij zich heeft gevestigd, beschouwd wordt de rechten en verplichtingen te hebben, aan het bezit van de nationaliteit van dat land verbonden.   
F.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing op een persoon ten aanzien van wie er ernstige redenen zijn om te veronderstellen, dat: 

(a) hij een misdrijf tegen de vrede, een oorlogsmisdrijf of een misdrijf tegen de menselijkheid heeft begaan, zoals omschreven in de internationale overeenkomsten welke zijn opgesteld om bepalingen met betrekking tot deze misdrijven in het leven te roepen;  

(b) hij een ernstig, niet-politiek misdrijf heeft begaan buiten het land van toevlucht, voordat hij tot dit land als vluchteling is toegelaten;

4. De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen in welwillende overweging nemen om aan vluchtelingen, bij het ontbreken van de voorwaarde van wederkerigheid, rechten en voordelen te verlenen buiten die waarop zij krachtens lid 2 en 3 aanspraak kunnen maken, alsmede om de vrijstelling van de voorwaarde van wederkerigheid uit te strekken tot vluchtelingen die niet aan de in lid 2 en 3 bedoelde voorwaarden voldoen.

De Verdragsluitende Staten die krachtens hun wetgeving niet het in dit artikel neergelegde algemene beginsel kunnen toepassen, zullen in de daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen vrijstelling ten gunste van zodanige vluchtelingen verlenen.

2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen al het mogelijke doen, overeenkomstig hun wetten en grondwetten, om de vestiging van zodanige vluchtelingen in gebieden buiten het moederland, voor welker internationale betrekkingen zij verantwoordelijk zijn, te verzekeren.

Wat de huisvesting betreft, zullen de Verdragsluitende Staten, voor zover deze aangelegenheid geregeld is bij de wet of door voorschriften dan wel onderworpen is aan overheidstoezicht, de rechtmatig op hun grondgebied verblijvende vluchtelingen zo gunstig mogelijk behandelen en in elk geval niet minder gunstig dan vreemdelingen in het algemeen onder dezelfde omstandigheden.

####Arbeidswetgeving en sociale zekerheid

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen de rechtmatig op hun grondgebied verblijvende vluchtelingen op dezelfde wijze behandelen als de onderdanen, wat de volgende aangelegenheden betreft: 

(a) Voor zover deze aangelegenheden zijn geregeld bij de wet of door voorschriften dan wel onderworpen zijn aan overheidstoezicht: beloning, niet inbegrip van gezinsuitkeringen welke daarvan deel uitmaken, werktijden, overwerk, betaald verlof, beperking van huisarbeid, minimum-leeftijd voor arbeid in loondienst, leerlingenstelsel en vakopleiding, arbeid van vrouwen en jeugdige personen, en aanspraken uit collectieve arbeidsovereenkomsten;  

(b) Sociale zekerheid (wettelijke voorschriften betreffende arbeidsongevallen, beroepsziekten, moederschap, ziekte, invaliditeit, ouderdom, overlijden, werkloosheid, gezinslasten en elk ander risico dat, overeenkomstig de nationale wetgeving, valt onder een stelsel van sociale zekerheid), behoudens: 

i) Passende regelingen voor de handhaving van verkregen rechten en van rechten welker verkrijging een aanvang heeft genomen;  

ii) Bijzondere, door de nationale wetgeving van het land van verblijf voorgeschreven regelingen betreffende uitkeringen of gedeeltelijke uitkeringen, geheel betaalbaar uit openbare geldmiddelen, alsmede uitkeringen, gedaan aan hen die niet voldoen aan de voor de toekenning van een normale uitkering gestelde voorwaarden inzake bijdragen.       
2.  Het recht op schadeloosstelling wegens het overlijden van een vluchteling, veroorzaakt door een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte, wordt niet aangetast door het feit, dat de rechthebbende buiten het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Staat is gevestigd.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen de voordelen van tussen hen gesloten of nog te sluiten overeenkomsten betreffende de handhaving van verkregen rechten of van rechten welker verkrijging een aanvang heeft genomen op het gebied van sociale zekerheid, uitstrekken tot vluchtelingen, voor zover deze voldoen aan de voorwaarden, gesteld aan de onderdanen van de Staten die partij zijn bij de overeenkomsten in kwestie.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen in welwillende overweging nemen om, voor zover mogelijk, de voordelen van soortgelijke overeenkomsten welke van kracht zijn of zullen worden tussen deze Verdragsluitende Staten en niet-Verdragsluitende Staten, uit te strekken tot vluchtelingen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Administratieve maatregelen

### Artikel  25  

####Administratieve bijstand

1.  Wanneer de uitoefening van een recht door een vluchteling normaal de medewerking zou vereisen van buitenlandse autoriteiten op wie hij geen beroep kan doen, zullen de Verdragsluitende Staten op wier grondgebied hij verblijft, zorg dragen, dat zodanige medewerking hem wordt verleend door hun eigen autoriteiten of door een internationale autoriteit.   
2.  De in lid 1 bedoelde autoriteit of autoriteiten zullen aan vluchtelingen de documenten of verklaringen verstrekken of onder haar toezicht doen verstrekken, welke normaal aan vreemdelingen zouden worden verstrekt door of door tussenkomst van hun nationale autoriteiten.   
3.  De aldus verstrekte documenten of verklaringen zullen strekken tot vervanging van de officiële bewijsstukken welke aan vreemdelingen door of door tussenkomst van hun nationale autoriteiten worden afgegeven, en zullen geloof verdienen behoudens tegenbewijs.   
4.  Onverminderd de uitzonderingen welke ten gunste van behoeftigen worden toegestaan, mogen de in dit artikel genoemde diensten worden belast; maar deze heffingen moeten matig zijn en evenredig aan die welke aan de onderdanen voor soortgelijke diensten worden opgelegd.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel doen geen afbreuk aan de artikelen 27 en 28.   

### Artikel  26  

####Bewegingsvrijheid

Elke Verdragsluitende Staat zal aan de rechtmatig op zijn grondgebied vertoevende vluchtelingen het recht verlenen er hun verblijf te kiezen en zich vrij op dat grondgebied te bewegen, onverminderd de voorschriften welke op vreemdelingen in het algemeen van toepassing zijn onder dezelfde omstandigheden.  

### Artikel  27  

####Identiteitspapieren

De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen identiteitspapieren verstrekken aan elke vluchteling op hun grondgebied, die niet in het bezit is van een geldig reisdocument.  

### Artikel  28  

####Reisdocumenten

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen aan de rechtmatig op hun grondgebied verblijvende vluchtelingen reisdocumenten verstrekken voor het reizen buiten dat grondgebied, tenzij dwingende redenen van nationale veiligheid of openbare orde zich daartegen verzetten; de bepalingen van de Bijlage van dit Verdrag zijn van toepassing op deze documenten. De Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen een zodanig reisdocument verstrekken aan elke andere vluchteling op hun grondgebied; in het bijzonder zullen zij in welwillende overweging nemen, een zodanig reisdocument te verstrekken aan vluchtelingen op hun grondgebied, die niet in staat zijn een reisdocument te verkrijgen van het land van hun rechtmatig verblijf.   
2.  De reisdocumenten welke krachtens vroegere internationale overeenkomsten door partijen daarbij aan vluchtelingen zijn verstrekt, zullen door de Verdragsluitende Staten worden erkend en behandeld alsof zij krachtens dit artikel aan de vluchtelingen waren verstrekt.   

### Artikel  29  

####Fiscale lasten

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen vluchtelingen niet aan andere of hogere rechten, heffingen of belastingen, van welke benaming ook, onderwerpen dan die welke worden of kunnen worden geheven ten aanzien van hun onderdanen in soortgelijke omstandigheden.   
2.  Geen der bepalingen van het voorgaand lid vormt een belemmering voor de toepassing op vluchtelingen van de wetten en voorschriften betreffende de heffingen met betrekking tot de verstrekking aan vreemdelingen van administratieve documenten, waaronder begrepen identiteitspapieren.   

### Artikel  30  

####Transfer van activa

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Staat zal, overeenkomstig zijn wetten en voorschriften, aan vluchtelingen toestaan de activa welke zij binnen zijn grondgebied hebben gebracht, over te maken naar een ander land waar zij zijn toegelaten om zich opnieuw te vestigen.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Staat zal de verzoeken in welwillende overweging nemen, welke worden ingediend door vluchtelingen om toestemming te verkrijgen alle andere activa over te maken, welke noodzakelijk zijn voor hun nieuwe vestiging in een ander land waar zij zijn toegelaten.   

### Artikel  31  

####Illegale vluchtelingen in het land van toevlucht

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen geen strafsancties, op grond van onrechtmatige binnenkomst of onrechtmatig verblijf, toepassen op vluchtelingen die, rechtstreeks komend van een grondgebied waar hun leven of vrijheid in de zin van artikel 1 werd bedreigd, zonder toestemming hun grondgebied binnenkomen of zich aldaar bevinden, mits zij zich onverwijld bij de autoriteiten melden en deze overtuigen, dat zij geldige redenen hebben voor hun onrechtmatige binnenkomst of onrechtmatige aanwezigheid.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen de bewegingsvrijheid van zodanige vluchtelingen niet verder beperken dan noodzakelijk; deze beperkingen zullen alleen worden toegepast totdat hun status in het land van toevlucht is geregeld of totdat zij er in geslaagd zijn toegelaten te worden in een ander land. De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen aan deze vluchtelingen een redelijk uitstel, alsmede de nodige faciliteiten, verlenen teneinde toelating te verkrijgen in een ander land.   

### Artikel  32  

####Uitzetting

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen een rechtmatig op hun grondgebied vertoevende vluchteling niet uitzetten behoudens om redenen van nationale veiligheid of openbare orde.   
2.  De uitzetting van een zodanige vluchteling zal alleen mogen plaats vinden ter uitvoering van een besluit dat is genomen in overeenstemming met de wettelijk voorziene procedure. Behoudens indien dwingende redenen van nationale veiligheid zich daartegen verzetten, is het de vluchteling toegestaan bewijs over te leggen om zich vrij te pleiten, alsmede zich te wenden tot een bevoegde autoriteit en zich te dien einde te doen vertegenwoordigen bij die autoriteit of bij één of meer speciaal door die bevoegde autoriteit aangewezen personen.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen een zodanige vluchteling een redelijk uitstel gunnen teneinde hem in staat te stellen te pogen in een ander land rechtmatig toegelaten te worden. De Verdragsluitende Staten behouden het recht, gedurende dat uitstel, zodanige interne maatregelen toe te passen als zij noodzakelijk achten.   

### Artikel  33  

####Verbod tot uitzetting of terugleiding („refoulement" )

1.  Geen der Verdragsluitende Staten zal, op welke wijze ook, een vluchteling uitzetten of terugleiden naar de grenzen van een grondgebied waar zijn leven of vrijheid bedreigd zou worden op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, het behoren tot een bepaalde sociale groep of zijn politieke overtuiging.   
2.  Op de voordelen van deze bepaling kan evenwel geen aanspraak worden gemaakt door een vluchteling ten aanzien van wie er ernstige redenen bestaan hem te beschouwen als een gevaar voor de veiligheid van het land waar hij zich bevindt, of die, bij gewijsde veroordeeld wegens een bijzonder ernstig misdrijf, een gevaar oplevert voor de gemeenschap van dat land.   

### Artikel  34  

####Naturalisatie

De Verdragsluitende Staten zullen, voor zover mogelijk, de assimilatie en naturalisatie van vluchtelingen vergemakkelijken. Zij zullen in het bijzonder er naar streven de naturalisatie-procedure te bespoedigen en de tarieven en kosten van deze procedure zoveel mogelijk te verminderen.

###IV

De Conferentie heeft met algemene stemmen de volgende aanbevelingen aangenomen: 

A „De Conferentie, „Overwegende, dat de verstrekking en erkenning van reisdocumenten noodzakelijk zijn om het reizen van vluchtelingen en, in het bijzonder, hun nieuwe vestiging te vergemakkelijken, „Verzoekt uitdrukkelijk aan de Regeringen die partij zijn bij de op 15 October 1946 te Londen ondertekende Intergouvernementele Overeenkomst betreffende de afgifte van een reisdocument aan vluchtelingen, of die de geldigheid van de in overeenstemming met die Overeenkomst afgegeven reisdocumenten erkennen, voort te gaan zodanige reisdocumenten te verstrekken of te erkennen, en deze reisdocumenten te verstrekken aan vluchtelingen die onder de omschrijving van artikel 1 van het Verdrag betreffende de status van vluchtelingen vallen, of de aldus aan deze personen verstrekte reisdocumenten te erkennen, totdat zij de uit artikel 28 van genoemd Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen op zich hebben genomen".  

B „De Conferentie, „Overwegende, dat de eenheid van het gezin - de natuurlijke en fundamentele groepseenheid van de maatschappij - een wezenlijk recht van de vluchteling is en dat deze eenheid voortdurend wordt bedreigd, en „Met voldoening vaststellend, dat, volgens het officieel commentaar van de Commissie ad hoc betreffende de staatloosheid en aanverwante vraagstukken (E/1618, blz. 38) de aan een vluchteling verleende rechten eveneens van toepassing zijn op zijn gezinsleden, „Beveelt de Regeringen aan, de nodige maatregelen te nemen voor de bescherming van het gezin van de vluchteling, in het bijzonder teneinde: 

„1) De handhaving van de eenheid van het gezin van de vluchteling te verzekeren, in het bijzonder in de gevallen waarin het hoofd van het gezin aan de voor de toelating in een bepaald land vereiste voorwaarden heeft voldaan;  

2) De bescherming van minderjarige vluchtelingen te verzekeren, in het bijzonder onbegeleide kinderen en jonge meisjes, met name wat betreft voogdij en adoptie".    

C „De Conferentie, „Overwegende, dat de vluchteling in moreel, wettelijk en materieel opzicht de steun behoeft van sociale diensten, in het bijzonder die van de bevoegde niet-gouvernementele organisaties, „Beveelt de Regeringen en inter-gouvernementele organen aan, de werkzaamheden van de behoorlijk voor haar taak berekende organisaties te vergemakkelijken, aan te moedigen en te ondersteunen".  

D „De Conferentie, „Overwegende, dat nog velen hun land van herkomst om redenen van vervolging verlaten en dat zij op grond van hun bijzondere positie recht hebben op speciale bescherming, „Beveelt de Regeringen aan, voort te gaan vluchtelingen op haar grondgebied op te nemen, en in een ware geest van internationale solidariteit samen te werken, opdat deze vluchtelingen asyl kunnen vinden en in staat worden gesteld zich opnieuw te vestigen".  

E „De Conferentie, „Geeft uiting aan de hoop, dat het Verdrag betreffende de status van vluchtelingen als een voorbeeld zal dienen, dat de grenzen van de contractuele betekenis van het "Verdrag zal overschrijden, en dat het alle Staten zal opwekken om de zich op hun grondgebied als vluchteling bevindende personen die niet onder de bepalingen van het Verdrag vallen, zoveel mogelijk dienovereenkomstig te behandelen".
