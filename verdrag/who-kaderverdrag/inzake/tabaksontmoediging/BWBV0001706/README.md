####WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control

*Preamble*  The Parties to this Convention, Determined to give priority to their right to protect public health, Recognizing that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is a global problem with serious consequences for public health that calls for the widest possible international cooperation and the participation of all countries in an effective, appropriate and comprehensive international response, Reflecting the concern of the international community about the devastating worldwide health, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, Seriously concerned about the increase in the worldwide consumption and production of cigarettes and other tobacco products, particularly in developing countries, as well as about the burden this places on families, on the poor, and on national health systems, Recognizing that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke cause death, disease and disability, and that there is a time lag between the exposure to smoking and the other uses of tobacco products and the onset of tobacco-related diseases, Recognizing also that cigarettes and some other products containing tobacco are highly engineered so as to create and maintain dependence, and that many of the compounds they contain and the smoke they produce are pharmacologically active, toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic, and that tobacco dependence is separately classified as a disorder in major international classifications of diseases, Acknowledging that there is clear scientific evidence that prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke causes adverse health and developmental conditions for children, Deeply concerned about the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents worldwide, particularly smoking at increasingly early ages, Alarmed by the increase in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by women and young girls worldwide and keeping in mind the need for full participation of women at all levels of policy-making and implementation and the need for gender-specific tobacco control strategies, Deeply concerned about the high levels of smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by indigenous peoples, Seriously concerned about the impact of all forms of advertising, promotion and sponsorship aimed at encouraging the use of tobacco products, Recognizing that cooperative action is necessary to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting, Acknowledging that tobacco control at all levels and particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition requires sufficient financial and technical resources commensurate with the current and projected need for tobacco control activities, Recognizing the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to address the long-term social and economic implications of successful tobacco demand reduction strategies, Mindful of the social and economic difficulties that tobacco control programmes may engender in the medium and long term in some developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and recognizing their need for technical and financial assistance in the context of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development, Conscious of the valuable work being conducted by many States on tobacco control and commending the leadership of the World Health Organization as well as the efforts of other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international and regional intergovernmental organizations in developing measures on tobacco control, Emphasizing the special contribution of nongovernmental organizations and other members of civil society not affiliated with the tobacco industry, including health professional bodies, women's, youth, environmental and consumer groups, and academic and health care institutions, to tobacco control efforts nationally and internationally and the vital importance of their participation in national and international tobacco control efforts, Recognizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts, Recalling Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, which states that it is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Recalling also the preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization, which states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition, Determined to promote measures of tobacco control based on current and relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations, Recalling that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1979, provides that States Parties to that Convention shall take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care, Recalling further that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, provides that States Parties to that Convention recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, Have agreed, as follows:

####WHO-Kaderverdrag inzake tabaksontmoediging

*Preambule*  De Partijen bij dit Verdrag, Vastbesloten prioriteit te verlenen aan hun recht de volksgezondheid te beschermen, Erkennend dat de verbreiding van de tabaksepidemie een mondiaal probleem is met ernstige gevolgen voor de volksgezondheid, dat vraagt om een zo breed mogelijke internationale samenwerking en de participatie van alle landen in een doeltreffend, passend en allesomvattend internationaal antwoord, Uitdrukking gevend aan de bezorgdheid van de internationale gemeenschap over de verwoestende wereldwijde gezondheidseffecten en sociale, economische en milieugevolgen van tabaksconsumptie en blootstelling aan tabaksrook, Ernstig bezorgd over de toename van de wereldwijde consumptie en productie van sigaretten en andere tabaksproducten, in het bijzonder in ontwikkelingslanden, alsmede over de last die dit legt op gezinnen, armen en de nationale stelsels van gezondheidszorg, Erkennend dat wetenschappelijk bewijs onomstotelijk heeft aangetoond dat tabaksconsumptie en blootstelling aan tabaksrook dood, ziekte en arbeidsongeschiktheid veroorzaken, en dat er geruime tijd ligt tussen de blootstelling aan roken en andere gebruikswijzen van tabaksproducten en het begin van tabaksgerelateerde ziekten, Tevens erkennend dat sigaretten en sommige andere producten die tabak bevatten zodanig worden bewerkt om verslaving te bewerkstelligen en in stand te houden, en dat veel van de stoffen die ze bevatten en de rook die ze voortbrengen farmacologisch actief, giftig, mutageen en carcinogeen zijn, en dat tabaksverslaving in belangrijke internationale ziekteclassificatiesystemen als een afzonderlijke stoornis wordt geclassificeerd, Erkennend dat er duidelijk wetenschappelijk bewijs is dat prenatale blootstelling aan tabaksrook schadelijk is voor de gezondheid en ontwikkeling van kinderen, Ernstig bezorgd over de wereldwijde toename van roken en andere vormen van tabaksconsumptie door kinderen en jongeren, in het bijzonder het roken op steeds jongere leeftijd, Verontrust door de wereldwijde toename van roken en andere vormen van tabaksconsumptie door vrouwen en meisjes en indachtig de noodzaak van volledige participatie van vrouwen op alle niveaus van beleidsvorming en -uitvoering en de behoefte aan genderspecifieke strategieën voor tabaksontmoediging, Ernstig bezorgd over de hoge niveaus van roken en andere vormen van tabaksconsumptie onder inheemse volkeren, Ernstig bezorgd over de invloed van alle vormen van reclame, promotie en sponsoring gericht op het aanmoedigen van het gebruik van tabaksproducten, Erkennend dat samenwerking nodig is om alle vormen van illegale handel in sigaretten en andere tabaksproducten, met inbegrip van smokkel, illegale productie en nabootsing, uit te bannen, Erkennend dat tabaksontmoediging op alle niveaus en in het bijzonder in ontwikkelingslanden en in landen met een overgangseconomie voldoende financiële en technische middelen vereist, evenredig met de huidige en verwachte behoefte aan activiteiten op het gebied van tabaksontmoediging, De noodzaak erkennend geschikte mechanismen te ontwikkelen om in te spelen op de sociaal-economische gevolgen op de lange termijn van succesvolle strategieën voor de vermindering van de vraag naar tabak, Indachtig de sociaal-economische problemen die programma's voor tabaksontmoediging op de middellange en lange termijn kunnen veroorzaken in sommige ontwikkelingslanden en landen met een overgangseconomie, en hun behoefte erkennend aan technische en financiële bijstand in het kader van nationaal ontwikkelde strategieën voor duurzame ontwikkeling, Zich bewust van het waardevolle werk dat door veel staten wordt verricht op het gebied van tabaksontmoediging, en met lof voor de voortrekkersrol van de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie alsmede de inspanningen van andere organisaties en instanties van de Verenigde Naties en andere internationale en regionale intergouvernementele organisaties bij de ontwikkeling van maatregelen voor tabaksontmoediging, De bijzondere bijdrage benadrukkend van niet-gouvernementele organisaties en andere maatschappelijke geledingen die niet met de tabaksindustrie gelieerd zijn, waaronder gezondheidsinstanties, vrouwen-, jongeren-, milieu- en consumentengroeperingen, en universitaire en gezondheidszorginstanties, aan nationale en internationale inspanningen op het gebied van tabaksontmoediging en het vitale belang van hun deelname aan nationale en internationale op tabaksontmoediging gerichte inspanningen, De noodzaak erkennend waakzaam te zijn ten aanzien van pogingen van de tabaksindustrie om inspanningen ten behoeve van tabaksontmoediging te ondermijnen of te ontkrachten en de noodzaak op de hoogte te zijn van activiteiten van de tabaksindustrie die een negatieve invloed op inspanningen ten behoeve van tabaksontmoediging hebben, In herinnering roepend artikel 12 van het Internationaal Verdrag inzake economische, sociale en culturele rechten, aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties op 16 december 1966, waarin wordt verklaard dat eenieder recht heeft op het genot van het hoogst haalbare niveau van lichamelijke en geestelijke gezondheid, Eveneens in herinnering roepend de preambule van het Statuut van de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie, waarin wordt verklaard dat het genot van het hoogst haalbare niveau van gezondheid een van de grondrechten van ieder mens is, zonder onderscheid naar ras, godsdienst, politieke overtuiging of economische of sociale omstandigheden, Vastbesloten maatregelen voor tabaksontmoediging die zijn gebaseerd op actuele en relevante wetenschappelijke, technische en economische overwegingen te bevorderen, In herinnering roepend dat in het Verdrag inzake de uitbanning van alle vormen van discriminatie van vrouwen, door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties aangenomen op 18 december 1979, wordt bepaald dat de staten die partij bij dat Verdrag zijn passende maatregelen nemen om discriminatie van vrouwen op het terrein van de gezondheidszorg uit te bannen, Voorts in herinnering roepend dat in het Verdrag inzake de rechten van het kind, aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties op 20 november 1989, wordt bepaald dat de staten die partij bij dat Verdrag zijn het recht van het kind op het genot van het hoogst haalbare niveau van gezondheid erkennen, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

### DEEL  II  

####DOEL, RICHTSNOEREN EN ALGEMENE VERPLICHTINGEN

### Artikel  3  

####Doel

Het doel van dit Verdrag en de protocollen daarbij is de huidige en toekomstige generaties te beschermen tegen de verwoestende gezondheidseffecten en sociale, milieu- en economische gevolgen van tabaksconsumptie en blootstelling aan tabaksrook door een kader te bieden voor maatregelen ten behoeve van tabaksontmoediging die door de Partijen op nationaal, regionaal en internationaal niveau moeten worden uitgevoerd om het wijdverbreide tabaksgebruik en de blootstelling aan tabaksrook permanent en substantieel te verminderen.  

### Artikel  4  

####Richtsnoeren

Teneinde het doel van dit Verdrag en de protocollen daarbij te bereiken en de bepalingen ervan uit te voeren, worden de Partijen, onder andere, geleid door de onderstaande beginselen: 

1. Iedereen moet worden geïnformeerd over de gevolgen voor de gezondheid, het verslavende karakter en de dodelijke bedreiging die uitgaat van tabaksconsumptie en blootstelling aan tabaksrook en op het aangewezen regeringsniveau moet worden nagedacht over doeltreffende wetgevende, uitvoerende, bestuurlijke of andere maatregelen om iedereen te beschermen tegen blootstelling aan tabaksrook.  

2. Sterke politieke betrokkenheid is vereist om op nationaal, regionaal en internationaal niveau allesomvattende multisectorale maatregelen en een gecoördineerd optreden te ontwikkelen en te ondersteunen, waarbij het volgende in aanmerking moet worden genomen: 

a. de noodzaak maatregelen te nemen om iedereen tegen blootstelling aan tabaksrook te beschermen;  

b. de noodzaak maatregelen te nemen om te voorkomen dat met de consumptie van tabaksproducten in welke vorm dan ook wordt begonnen, om het stoppen ermee te bevorderen en te ondersteunen, en de consumptie ervan te verminderen;  

c. de noodzaak maatregelen te nemen ter bevordering van de participatie van inheemse personen en gemeenschappen in de ontwikkeling, uitvoering en evaluatie van programma's voor tabaksontmoediging die in sociaal-cultureel opzicht bij hun behoeften en omstandigheden aansluiten; en  

d. de noodzaak maatregelen te nemen om bij de ontwikkeling van strategieën voor tabaksontmoediging met genderspecifieke risico's rekening te houden.    

3. Internationale samenwerking, in het bijzonder de overdracht van technologie, kennis en financiële bijstand en het bieden van daaraan gerelateerde expertise, teneinde doeltreffende programma's voor tabaksontmoediging op te zetten en uit te voeren, hierbij lokale culturele, alsmede sociale, economische, politieke en juridische factoren in aanmerking nemend, vormt een belangrijk onderdeel van het Verdrag.  

4. Allesomvattende multisectorale maatregelen en optreden teneinde de consumptie van alle tabaksproducten op nationaal, regionaal en internationaal niveau te verminderen, zijn van wezenlijk belang om, in overeenstemming met de beginselen van volksgezondheid, het voorkomen van ziektes, voortijdige arbeidsongeschiktheid en sterfte als gevolg van tabaksconsumptie en blootstelling aan tabaksrook te voorkomen.  

5. Kwesties met betrekking tot aansprakelijkheid, zoals door elke Partij binnen haar rechtsgebied bepaald, vormen een belangrijk onderdeel van een allesomvattend tabaksontmoedigingsbeleid.  

6. Het belang van technische en financiële bijstand ter bevordering van de economische overgang van tabakstelers en -werknemers in ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn, alsmede in Partijen met een overgangseconomie, wier levensonderhoud als gevolg van programma's voor tabaksontmoediging ernstig in gevaar komt, moet worden onderkend en aangepakt in het kader van op nationaal niveau ontwikkelde strategieën voor duurzame ontwikkeling.  

7. De participatie van maatschappelijke organisaties is van wezenlijk belang voor de verwezenlijking van het doel van het Verdrag en de protocollen daarbij.

Deze autoriteiten kunnen, afhankelijk van het nationaal recht, besluiten deze cijfers in overeenstemming met artikel 21 aan het publiek en aan de Conferentie van de Partijen beschikbaar te stellen;  

e. binnen een periode van vijf jaar over te gaan tot een allesomvattend verbod voor tabaksreclame, -promotie en -sponsoring via radio, televisie, gedrukte media en, in voorkomend geval, andere media, zoals het internet, of, indien een Partij daartoe vanwege haar grondwet of grondwettelijke beginselen niet in staat is, deze te beperken; en

In dit lid worden geen specifieke sancties ondersteund of goedgekeurd.   
8.  De Partijen overwegen de opstelling van een protocol waarin passende maatregelen worden neergelegd waarvoor internationale samenwerking vereist is voor een allesomvattend verbod op grensoverschrijdende reclame, promotie en sponsoring.
