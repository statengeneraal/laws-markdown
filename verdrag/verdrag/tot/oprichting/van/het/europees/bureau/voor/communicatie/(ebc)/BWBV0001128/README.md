### Bijlage  B  

####Arbitrageprocedure

1. Ter verkrijging van een scheidsrechterlijke uitspraak in elk geding als bedoeld in artikel 19 van dit Verdrag wordt een scheidsgerecht ingesteld overeenkomstig de onderstaande paragrafen.  

2. Elke Partij bij dit Verdrag kan zich in de arbitrageprocedure voegen bij een partij bij het geschil.  

3. Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden. Elke partij bij het geschil benoemt een scheidsman binnen een termijn van twee maanden te rekenen vanaf de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek van één van de partijen om het geschil aan arbitrage te onderwerpen. De eerste twee scheidsmannen benoemen binnen een termijn van zes maanden na de benoeming van de tweede scheidsman een derde scheidsman, die voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht is. Indien één van de twee scheidsmannen niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn is benoemd, wordt deze op verzoek van één van de partijen benoemd door de Secretaris-Generaal van het Permanente Hof van Arbitrage. Deze procedure is ook van toepassing indien de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn is benoemd.  

4. Het scheidsgerecht bepaalt waar zijn zetel is en stelt zijn eigen reglement van orde vast.  

5. De beslissing van het scheidsgerecht dient in overeenstemming te zijn met het internationale recht en dient gebaseerd te zijn op dit Verdrag en de algemene rechtsbeginselen.  

6. Elke partij draagt de kosten van de scheidsman die zij benoemt, alsmede de kosten van haar vertegenwoordiging voor het scheidsgerecht. De kosten van de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht worden in gelijke delen gedragen door de partijen bij het geschil.  

7. De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht wordt gedaan bij een meerderheid van stemmen van zijn leden, die zich niet van stemming mogen onthouden. Deze uitspraak is onherroepelijk en bindend voor alle partijen bij het geschil en hiertegen staat geen enkel rechtsmiddel open. De partijen gaan onverwijld over tot tenuitvoerlegging van de uitspraak. In geval van verschil van mening aangaande de betekenis of strekking van de uitspraak, legt het scheidsgerecht deze uit op verzoek van één van de partijen bij het geschil.
