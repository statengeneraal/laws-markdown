### Article  II  

####Purposes

1.  The Organization shall provide for collaboration among European States in nuclear research of a pure scientific and fundamental character, and in research essentially related thereto. The Organization shall have no concern with work for military requirements and the results of its experimental and theoretical work shall be published or otherwise made generally available.   
2.  The Organization shall, in the collaboration referred to in paragraph 1 above, confine its activities to the following: 

a. The construction and operation of one or more international laboratories (hereinafter referred to as “the Laboratories”) for research on high-energy particles, including work in the field of cosmic rays. Each Laboratory shall include: 

(i) one or more particle accelerators;  

(ii) the necessary ancillary apparatus for use in the research programmes carried out by means of the machines referred to in (i) above;  

(iii) the necessary buildings to contain the equipment referred to in (i) and (ii) above and for the administration of the Organization and the fulfilment of its other functions.    

b. The organization and sponsoring of international co-operation in nuclear research, including co-operation outside the Laboratories. This co-operation may include in particular: 

(i) work in the field of theoretical nuclear physics;  

(ii) the promotion of contacts between, and the interchange of, scientists, the dissemination of information, and the provision of advanced training for research workers;  

(iii) collaborating with and advising other research institutions;  

(iv) work in the field of cosmic rays.       
3.  The programmes of activities of the Organization shall be: 

a. The programme carried out at its Laboratory at Geneva including a proton synchrotron for energies above ten gigaelectronvolts (10 <sup>10</sup> eV) and a synchro-cyclotron for energies of six hundred million electronvolts (6 x 10 <sup>8</sup> eV);  

b. The programme for the construction and operation of the intersecting storage rings connected to the proton synchrotron described in sub-paragraph (*a*) above;  

c. The programme for the construction and operation of a Laboratory to include a proton synchrotron for energies of about three hundred gigaelectronvolts (3 x 10 <sup>11</sup> eV);  

d. Any other programme falling within the terms of paragraph 2 above.     
4.  The programmes referred to in sub-paragraph *c* and *d* of paragraph 3 above shall require approval by the Council by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States. In giving such approval, the Council shall define the programme, and this definition shall include those administrative, financial and other provisions necessary for the proper management of the programme.   
5.  Any change to the definition of a programme shall require approval by the Council by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States.   
6.  Until the bringing into operation of the accelarator referred to in sub-paragraph *c* of paragraph 3 above, the date of which shall be determined by the Council by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States, the basic programme of the Organization shall be that referred to in sub-paragraph *a* of that paragraph. From that date, the programme referred to in sub-paragraph *c* shall also become part of the basic programme, and the Council may, by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States, decide that the programme referred to in sub-paragraph *a*, provided that no Member State participating in that programme votes to the contrary, is no longer part of the basic programme.   
7.  The Laboratories shall co-operate to the fullest possible extent with laboratories and institutes in the territories of Member States within the scope of their programmes of activities. So far as is consistent with the aims of the Organization, the Laboratories shall seek to avoid duplicating research work which is being carried out in the said laboratories or institutes.   

### Article  III  

####Conditions of Membership

1.  States which are parties to the Agreement of the fifteenth of February, 1952, referred to in the Preamble hereto, or which have contributed in money or in kind to the Council thereby established and actually participated in its work, shall have the right to become members of the Organization by becoming parties to this Convention in accordance with the provisions of Articles XV, XVI and XVII.   
2. 
a. Other States may be admitted to the Organization by the Council referred to in Article IV by a unanimous decision of all the Member-States.  

b. If a State wishes to join the Organization in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph, it shall notify the President of the Council. The President shall inform all Member States of this request at least three months before it is discussed by the Council. States accepted by the Council may become members of the Organization by acceding to this Convention in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII.     
3.  Each Member State shall signify in writing to the President of the Council those programmes of activities in which it wishes to participate.

4.  The Council may, by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States, determine a minimum initial period of participation in any programme of activities together with a limit on the expenditure that may be incurred for that programme during that period. Once this period of participation and limit of expenditure have been so determined, the Council may, by the same majority, change either provided that no Member State participating in the programme votes to the contrary. Subject to any such minimum period of participation, a Member State may at any time give notice in writing to the President of the Council of withdrawal from any programme, and such withdrawal shall take effect at the end of the financial year following that in which notice is given, or on such later date as the Member State proposes.   
5.

(ii) the Council may decide, by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States, to take into account any special circumstances of a Member State and adjust its contribution accordingly. For the purpose of applying this provision it shall be considered to be a special circumstance, in particular, when the national income “per capita” of a Member State is less than an amount to be decided by the Council by the same majority.       
2.  When participation by the Organization in a national or multinational project forms a programme of activities of the Organization, the terms of paragraph 1 above shall apply unless the Council, by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States, determines otherwise.   
3.  The contributions to be paid by a Member State under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be calculated in respect of, and applied only to, the programmes in which it participates.   
4.  

a. The Council shall require States which become parties to this Convention after the thirty-first of December, 1954, to make a special contribution towards the capital expenditure of the Organization already incurred in respect of the programmes in which they participate, in addition to contributing to future capital expenditure and current operating expenses. The Council shall require a similar contribution from Member States in respect of any programme in which they first participate after its commencement. The amount of this special contribution shall be fixed by the Council by a two-thirds majority of all the Member States.  

b. All contributions made in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph *a* above shall be applied in reducing the contributions of the other Member States in respect of the programmes concerned.     
5.  Contributions due under the provisions of this Article shall be paid in accordance with the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention.   
6.  To the extent of the authority delegated to him under the terms of sub-paragraph *a* of paragraph 1 of Article VI, and subject to any directions given by the Council, a Director-General may accept gifts and legacies to the Organization provided that such gifts or legacies are not subject to any conditions inconsistent with the purposes of the Organization.

####Verdrag tot oprichting van een Europese Organisatie voor kernfysisch onderzoek

De Staten welke partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, In aanmerking nemende de op 15 februari 1952 te Genève ter ondertekening opengestelde Overeenkomst houdende de instelling van een Raad van Vertegenwoordigers van Europese Staten ter bestudering van de plannen voor een internationaal laboratorium en de organisatie van andere vormen van samenwerking op het gebied van kernfysisch onderzoek; In aanmerking nemende de op 30 juni 1953 te Parijs ondertekende Aanvullende Overeenkomst tot verlenging van genoemde Overeenkomst; en Verlangende ingevolge lid 2 van artikel III van genoemde Overeenkomst van 15 februari 1952, een Verdrag te sluiten tot oprichting van een Europese Organisatie voor kernfysisch onderzoek, met inbegrip van de oprichting van een Internationaal Laboratorium voor de uitvoering van een overeengekomen programma van zuiver wetenschappelijk en fundamenteel onderzoek met betrekking tot deeltjes met grote energieën;   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

####Oprichting van de Organisatie

1.  Hierbij wordt een Europese Organisatie voor kernfysisch onderzoek (hierna te noemen „de Organisatie”) opgericht.   
2.  De Organisatie is gevestigd te Genève, tenzij de in artikel IV genoemde Raad op een later tijdstip met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten besluit de zetel van de Organisatie te verplaatsen naar de plaats waar een der andere in artikel II, lid 2, onder *a* bedoelde laboratoria is gevestigd.   

### Artikel  II  

####Doelstellingen

1.  De Organisatie draagt zorg voor de samenwerking tussen de Europese Staten op het gebied van kernfysisch onderzoek van zuiver wetenschappelijke en fundamentele aard en onderzoekingen welke daar wezenlijk mee in verband staan. De Organisatie houdt zich niet bezig met werk voor militaire behoeften en de resultaten van haar proefondervindelijk en theoretisch werk worden gepubliceerd of op andere wijze voor iedereen toegankelijk gemaakt.   
2.  Ten aanzien van de in lid 1 bedoelde samenwerking beperkt de Organisatie haar werkzaamheden tot de hieronder genoemde: 

a. De bouw en het doen functioneren van een of meer internationale laboratoria (hierna te noemen „de Laboratoria”) voor het onderzoek met betrekking tot deeltjes met grote energieën, met inbegrip van werk op het gebied van kosmische straling. Elk Laboratorium omvat mede: 

(i) een of meer deeltjesversnellers;  

(ii) de noodzakelijke hulpapparatuur ten gebruike bij de onderzoekingsprogramma's uitgevoerd door middel van de hierboven onder (i) bedoelde installaties;  

(iii) de gebouwen welke noodzakelijk zijn voor de huisvesting van de hierboven onder (i) en (ii) bedoelde installaties en apparatuur, en voor het bestuur van haar andere functies.    

b. Het organiseren en stimuleren van internationale samenwerking op het gebied van kernfysisch onderzoek, met inbegrip van samenwerking buiten de Laboratoria. Deze samenwerking kan in het bijzonder betrekking hebben op: 

(i) werk op het gebied van de theoretische kernfysica;  

(ii) het bevorderen van contact tussen, en het uitwisselen van, wetenschappelijke onderzoekers, de verspreiding van inlichtingen en het verschaffen van de mogelijkheid voor wetenschappelijke onderzoekers hun kennis te verdiepen en hun beroepsvorming te voltooien;  

(iii) het samenwerken met, en het geven van advies aan, andere instellingen op het gebied van wetenschappelijk onderzoek;  

(iv) onderzoek op het gebied van kosmische straling.       
3.  De programma's van de Organisatie omvatten: 

a. Het programma dat op haar Laboratorium te Genève wordt uitgevoerd, waaronder begrepen een proton-synchrotron voor energieën boven tien Giga electron-Volt (10 <sup>10</sup> eV) en een synchrocyclotron voor energieën van 600 Mega electron-Volt (6 x 10 <sup>8</sup> eV);  

b. Het programma voor de bouw en het doen functioneren van de aan het onder *a* hierboven genoemde proton-synchrotron verbonden kruisende opslagringen;  

c. Het programma voor de bouw en het doen functioneren van een Laboratorium dat mede een proton-synchroton voor energieën van omstreeks driehonderd Giga electron-Volt (3 x 10 <sup>11</sup> eV) omvat;  

d. Eventuele andere programma's voor zover die binnen het in lid 2 hierboven gestelde kunnen worden ingepast.     
4.  De in lid 3, onder *c* en *d*, bedoelde programma's dienen door de Raad, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, te worden goedgekeurd. Tegelijk met het geven van zijn goedkeuring, geeft de Raad een omschrijving van het programma; in deze omschrijving worden de administratieve, financiële en andere bepalingen genoemd die voor een juiste uitvoering van het programma van node zijn.   
5.  Elke wijziging in de omschrijving van een programma dient door de Raad, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, te worden goedgekeurd.   
6.  Tot het tijdstip waarop de in lid 3, onder *c,* hierboven, bedoelde versneller in bedrijf zal worden gesteld, welk tijdstip door de Raad, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, wordt vastgesteld, geldt het in dat lid, onder *a,* bedoelde programma als het basisprogramma van de Organisatie. Van bedoeld tijdstip af vormt het onder *c* bedoelde programma ook een onderdeel van het basisprogramma. De Raad kan, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, beslissen dat het onder *a* bedoelde programma niet langer een onderdeel vormt van het basisprogramma, tenzij een aan dit programma deelnemende Lidstaat tegenstemt.   
7.  De Laboratoria zullen op zo groot mogelijke schaal samenwerken met laboratoria en instellingen op het grondgebied van de Lidstaten binnen het kader van hun programma's. Voor zover zulks in overeenstemming is met de doelstellingen van de Organisatie, trachten de Laboratoria dubbel werk te vermijden ten aanzien van de onderzoekingen welke in bedoelde laboratoria of instellingen worden verricht.   

### Artikel  III  

####Voorwaarden voor het lidmaatschap

1.  Staten welke partij zijn bij de in de Preambule van dit Verdrag bedoelde Overeenkomst van 15 februari 1952, of welke in geld of in natura hebben bijgedragen tot de bij die Overeenkomst ingestelde Raad en daadwerkelijk aan het werk van de Raad hebben deelgenomen, hebben het recht lid te worden van de Organisatie door partij te worden bij dit Verdrag in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de artikelen XV, XVI en XVII.   
2.  

a. Andere Staten kunnen door de in artikel IV bedoelde Raad tot de Organisatie worden toegelaten krachtens een met eenparigheid van stemmen genomen beslissing van alle Lidstaten.  

b. Indien een Staat zich overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel III, lid 2 *a,* wenst aan te sluiten bij de Organisatie, doet die Staat daarvan mededeling aan de President van de Raad. Uiterlijk drie maanden vóór de behandeling van dit verzoek door de Raad, doet de President aan alle Lidstaten mededeling van de indiening van dit verzoek. De Staten welke door de Raad zijn aangenomen, kunnen lid worden van de Organisatie door overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel XVII toe te treden tot dit Verdrag.     
3.  Elke Lidstaat verstrekt de President van de Raad schriftelijk een opgave van de programma's waaraan hij wenst deel te nemen. Geen enkele Staat heeft het recht lid van de Organisatie te worden, of te blijven, indien hij niet aan ten minste één van de programma's die een onderdeel van het basisprogramma vormen, deelneemt.   
4.  De Raad kan, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, tegelijk met het tijdvak waarvoor ten minste aan enig programma moet worden deelgenomen, de grens vaststellen die de aan bedoeld programma gedurende dat tijdvak ten koste te leggen bedragen niet mogen overschrijden. Zijn dit tijdvak van deelneming en deze kostengrens aldus eenmaal vastgesteld, dan kan de Raad, met dezelfde meerderheid, zowel het een als de andere wijzigen, tenzij een aan dat programma deelnemende Lidstaat tegenstemt. Een Lidstaat kan, met inachtneming van een minimumtijdvak als hierboven bedoeld, de President van de Raad er te allen tijde schriftelijk van in kennis stellen dat hij zich uit een programma wil terugtrekken; zodanige uittreding gaat in aan het eind van het boekjaar volgend op dat waarin de uittreding is aangekondigd, of op een daarvoor door de Lidstaat voorgesteld later tijdstip.   
5.  In het geval dat een programma wordt beëindigd, is de Raad voor de afwikkeling daarvan verantwoordelijk, met inachtneming van eventuele overeenkomsten die de Lidstaten die aan dat programma deelnemen op dat ogenblik met elkaar kunnen aangaan, en tevens met inachtneming van de ter zake dienende voorwaarden van enige overeenkomst die van kracht is tussen de Organisatie en de Staten op wier grondgebied het programma wordt uitgevoerd. Een eventueel overschot wordt onder de Lidstaten die, op het ogenblik waarop het programma wordt beëindigd, daaraan deelnemen, verdeeld op basis van de door hen in verband met bedoeld programma betaalde bijdragen. Indien er een tekort is, dan wordt dit door dezelfde Lidstaten bijgepast, waarbij hun voor het dan lopende boekjaar vastgestelde bijdragen in verband met bedoeld programma, als verdeelsleutel worden aangehouden.   
6.  Ten aanzien van de werkzaamheden van de Organisatie bevorderen de Lidstaten de uitwisseling van personen en van ter zake dienende wetenschappelijke en technische inlichtingen, onder voorwaarde dat geen enkele bepaling van dit lid 

a. van invloed is op de toepassing op personen van de wetten en voorschriften van Lidstaten met betrekking tot het binnenkomen in, verblijf op of vertrek uit het grondgebied van de Lidstaten, of  

b. van enige Lidstaat eist het verstrekken of doen verstrekken van in zijn eigen bezit zijnde inlichtingen voor zover hij van mening is, dat een zodanige verstrekking strijdig zou zijn met de belangen van zijn veiligheid.     

### Artikel  IV  

####Organen

De Organisatie bestaat uit een Raad en, voor elk der Laboratoria, een Directeur-Generaal, die wordt bijgestaan door een staf.  

### Artikel  V  

####De Raad

1.  Van iedere Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie hebben niet meer dan twee afgevaardigden zitting in de Raad; tijdens zittingen van de Raad kunnen deze afgevaardigden zich doen vergezellen van adviseurs.   
2.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag zal de Raad 

a. het beleid van de Organisatie vaststellen in wetenschappelijke, technische en administratieve aangelegenheden;  

b. de programma's van de Organisatie goedkeuren;  

c. de hoofdstukken van de begroting die op de verschillende programma's betrekking hebben met een twee derde meerderheid van de vertegenwoordigde Staten die hun stem uitbrengen aannemen en de financiële regelingen van de Organisatie vaststellen in overeenstemming met het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol;  

d. de uitgaven nagaan en de door accountants geverifieerde jaarstukken van de Organisatie goedkeuren en openbaar maken;  

e. beslissingen nemen ten aanzien van de samenstelling van het noodzakelijke personeel;  

f. een jaarverslag of jaarverslagen uitgeven;  

g. die bevoegdheden hebben en al die andere functies uitoefenen welke noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.     
3.  De Raad komt minstens eenmaal per jaar bijeen en wel daar waar de Raad zelf zal beslissen.   
4.  Elke Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie brengt één stem uit in de Raad.   
5.  De beslissingen van de Raad worden genomen met een gewone meerderheid van stemmen van de Lidstaten welke vertegenwoordigd zijn en welke hun stem uitbrengen, behalve indien hieromtrent in dit Verdrag anders wordt bepaald.   
6.  Waar in dit Verdrag of in het daaraan gehechte Financiële Protocol wordt bepaald dat een bepaalde aangelegenheid met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten door de Raad dient te worden goedgekeurd, en indien deze aangelegenheid rechtstreeks met een bepaald programma verband houdt, dient deze meerderheid tevens een twee derde meerderheid van alle aan dat programma deelnemende Lidstaten te vertegenwoordigen.   
7.  Behalve wanneer in dit Verdrag of in het daaraan gehechte Financiële Protocol wordt bepaald dat voor een bepaalde aangelegenheid de met algemene stemmen verleende goedkeuring van de Raad is vereist of dat de bedoelde aangelegenheid de goedkeuring behoeft van een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, heeft geen enkele Lidstaat het recht zijn stem uit te brengen met betrekking tot een aangelegenheid die binnen de krachtens artikel II door de Raad vastgestelde grenzen van een programma valt, wanneer hij niet aan dat programma deelneemt of indien de bedoelde aangelegenheid niet rechtstreeks verband houdt met een programma waaraan hij wel deelneemt.   
8.  Een Lidstaat heeft niet het recht zijn stem in de Raad uit te brengen, indien het bedrag van zijn achterstallige bijdragen aan de Organisatie hoger is dan het bedrag van de verschuldigde bijdragen voor het lopende boekjaar en het onmiddellijk daaraan voorafgaande boekjaar. Evenmin heeft hij het recht zijn stem in de Raad uit te brengen met betrekking tot een bepaald programma, indien het bedrag van zijn achterstallige bijdragen aan dat programma hoger is dan het bedrag van de verschuldigde bijdragen voor het lopende boekjaar en het onmiddellijk daaraan voorafgaande boekjaar. De Raad kan niettemin met een twee derde meerderheid van stemmen van alle Lidstaten beslissen dat een zodanige Staat zijn stem toch mag uitbrengen indien de Raad ervan overtuigd is dat de niet-betaling te wijten is aan omstandigheden waarop de betreffende Staat geen invloed kan uitoefenen.   
9.  Voor het in discussie brengen in de Raad van welke aangelegenheid ook is, om een quorum te kunnen vormen, de tegenwoordigheid van de afgevaardigden van een meerderheid van de Lidstaten, die gerechtigd moeten zijn ter zake van de desbetreffende aangelegenheid hun stem uit te brengen, noodzakelijk.   
10.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag stelt de Raad zijn eigen huishoudelijk reglement vast.   
11.  De Raad kiest een President en twee Vice-Presidenten die een jaar in functie blijven en die ten hoogste bij twee opeenvolgende gelegenheden herkozen mogen worden.   
12.  De Raad roept, behalve een Commissie voor het Wetenschappelijk beleid en een Financiële Commissie, die andere hulporganen in het leven waaraan in het belang van de Organisatie, en met name met het oog op de uitvoering en coördinatie van haar verschillende programma's behoefte zou kunnen bestaan. De oprichting en de opdrachten van zodanige organen worden vastgesteld door de Raad met een twee derde meerderheid van stemmen van alle Lidstaten. Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en van het daaraan gehechte Financiële Protocol, stellen de bedoelde hulporganen hun eigen huishoudelijk reglement vast.   
13.  In afwachting van de nederlegging van de akten van bekrachtiging of van toetreding kunnen de in lid 1 van artikel III bedoelde Staten zich doen vertegenwoordigen op de bijeenkomsten van de Raad en deelnemen aan het werk van de Raad tot 31 december 1954. Dit recht omvat niet het stemrecht tenzij de betreffende Staat tot de Organisatie heeft bijgedragen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van lid 1 van artikel 4 van het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol.   

### Artikel  VI  

####Directeuren-Generaal en personeel

1.  

a. De Raad benoemt, met een twee derde meerderheid van stemmen van alle Lidstaten, voor elk der Laboratoria een Directeur-Generaal voor een vastgesteld tijdvak; de Raad kan, eveneens met een twee derde meerderheid van stemmen van alle Lidstaten, de Directeur-Generaal ontslaan. Met betrekking tot het onder zijn leiding staande Laboratorium, is elke Directeur-Generaal de voornaamste uitvoerende persoon van de Organisatie en de wettelijke vertegenwoordiger van de Organisatie. Met betrekking tot het financieel bestuur van de Organisatie handelt hij overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol. De Raad kan, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, aan de Directeuren-Generaal, hetzij aan elk van hen afzonderlijk, hetzij hun tezamen, de bevoegdheid overdragen, in andere aangelegenheden namens de Organisatie op te treden. Elk der Directeuren-Generaal legt tevens een jaarverslag over aan de Raad en woont, zonder zelf stemrecht te hebben, alle vergaderingen van de Raad bij.  

b. Zowel bij het inwerkingtreden van dit Verdrag als bij een volgende vacature kan de Raad de benoeming van een Directeur-Generaal zolang uitstellen als de Raad nodig oordeelt. In een dergelijk geval benoemt de Raad een persoon om in de plaats van de Directeur-Generaal op te treden waarbij de bevoegdheden en verantwoordelijkheden van een dergelijk persoon door de Raad worden vastgesteld.     
2.  Elk der Directeuren-Generaal wordt bijgestaan door zodanig wetenschappelijk, technisch en administratief personeel als nodig zal worden geoordeeld en zal worden goedgekeurd door de Raad.   
3.  Alle leden van het personeel worden benoemd en kunnen worden ontslagen door de Raad op voordracht van de desbetreffende Directeur-Generaal. Voor benoemingen en ontslagen door de Raad is een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten noodzakelijk. Met eenzelfde meerderheid kan de Raad bevoegdheden ten aanzien van benoemingen en ontslagen overdragen aan krachtens het bepaalde in lid 12 van artikel V in het leven geroepen hulporganen, alsmede aan de Directeuren-Generaal. Elke zodanige benoeming en elk ontslag dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de personeelsvoorschriften die zullen worden aangenomen door de Raad met eenzelfde twee derde meerderheid. Eenieder die geen deel uitmaakt van de staf en die door of namens de Raad wordt uitgenodigd op een der Laboratoria te komen werken, is onderworpen aan het gezag van de desbetreffende Directeur-Generaal en aan zodanige algemene bepalingen als door de Raad zullen worden goedgekeurd.   
4.  De verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeuren-Generaal, de staf en het personeel voor secretariaatswerkzaamheden ten aanzien van de Organisatie zullen uitsluitend van internationale aard zijn. Bij het uitoefenen van hun functie zullen zij geen instructies vragen aan, noch instructies ontvangen van, een bepaalde regering of een niet bij de Organisatie betrokken instantie. Alle Lid-staten zullen de internationale aard van de verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeuren-Generaal en de staf eerbiedigen, en niet trachten hen in de uitoefening van hun functie te beïnvloeden.   

### Artikel  VII  

####Financiële bijdragen

1.  Alle Lidstaten dragen bij in de kapitaalsuitgaven en in lopende bedrijfsonkosten van de Organisatie 

a. gedurende de periode welke afloopt op 31 december 1956 als vastgesteld in het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol en, daarna,  

b. overeenkomstig schalen die elke drie jaar door de Raad worden vastgesteld met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten en welke gebaseerd zijn op het gemiddelde netto nationale inkomen tegen factorkosten van elke Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie over de laatste drie voorafgaande jaren waarover statistieken aanwezig zijn, met die uitzondering dat 

(i) ten aanzien van elk programma de Raad, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, een percentage kan vaststellen dat als maximum geldt dat een Lidstaat kan worden verplicht te betalen als zijn deel van het totale door de Raad vastgestelde bedrag der bijdragen om de jaarlijkse kosten van dat programma te bestrijden. Nadat een zodanig maximumpercentage aldus is vastgesteld, kan de Raad dit met dezelfde meerderheid wijzigen, tenzij een aan dat programma deelnemende Lidstaat zijn stem daartegen uitbrengt.  

(ii) de Raad kan besluiten met een meerderheid van twee derde van alle Lidstaten, bijzondere omstandigheden van een Staat welke Lid is van de Organisatie in aanmerking te nemen en de bijdrage van die Staat dienovereenkomstig aan te passen. Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling is er met name van een bijzondere omstandigheid sprake, wanneer het nationale inkomen per hoofd van een Lidstaat lager is dan een door de Raad met een zelfde meerderheid vast te stellen bedrag.       
2.  Indien de deelneming door de Organisatie aan een nationaal of multi-nationaal project een programma van de Organisatie vormt, zijn de bepalingen van lid 1 hierboven van toepassing, tenzij de Raad, met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten, anders bepaalt.   
3.  De krachtens lid 1 van dit artikel door een Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie te betalen bijdragen zullen worden berekend ten aanzien van, en uitsluitend worden aangewend voor, de programma's waaraan deze Lidstaat deelneemt.   
4.  

a. De Raad eist dat Staten welke na 31 december 1954 tot dit Verdrag toetreden een speciale bijdrage betalen ten aanzien van de reeds door de Organisatie gemaakte kapitaalsonkosten met betrekking tot de programma's waaraan zij deelnemen, boven de bijdrage voor toekomstige kapitaalsuitgaven en lopende bedrijfsonkosten. De Raad vordert een soortgelijke bijdrage van de Lidstaten met betrekking tot een programma waaraan zij, nadat daarmede een begin is gemaakt, voor het eerst deelnemen. Het bedrag van deze speciale bijdrage wordt vastgesteld door de Raad met een meerderheid van twee derde van alle Lidstaten.  

b. Alle overeenkomstig de bepalingen van bovenstaand lid 4 *a* betaalde bijdragen zullen worden aangewend ter vermindering van de bijdragen van de andere Lidstaten met betrekking tot de desbetreffende programma's.     
5.  De krachtens de bepalingen van dit artikel verschuldigde bijdragen worden betaald overeenkomstig het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol.   
6.  Binnen de krachtens het bepaalde onder *a* van lid 1 van artikel VI aan hem overgedragen bevoegdheid, en met inachtneming van eventueel door de Raad te geven aanwijzingen, kan een Directeur-Generaal voor de Organisatie bestemde giften en legaten aanvaarden mits aan zodanige giften en legaten geen voorwaarden verbonden zijn welke onverenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van de Organisatie.   

### Artikel  VIII  

####Samenwerking met de UNESCO en met andere organisaties

De Organisatie werkt samen met de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur. Zij kan, na een met een meerderheid van twee derde van alle Lidstaten genomen beslissing van de Raad, ook samenwerken met andere organisaties en instellingen.  

### Artikel  IX  

####Status

De Organisatie bezit rechtspersoonlijkheid op het grondgebied van het moederland van alle Lidstaten. Aan de Organisatie en de vertegenwoordigers van Lidstaten in de Raad, de leden van de krachtens lid 12 van artikel V ingestelde hulporganen, de Directeuren-Generaal en de leden van het personeel van de Organisatie worden op het grondgebied van het moederland van de Lidstaten krachtens tussen de Organisatie en elke betreffende Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie te sluiten overeenkomsten, eventueel die voorrechten en immuniteiten toegekend welke naar hun mening nodig zijn voor de uitoefening van de functies van de Organisatie. De overeenkomsten te sluiten tussen de Organisatie en de Lidstaten op wier grondgebied de Laboratoria van de Organisatie gevestigd zullen zijn, zullen behalve bepalingen betreffende voorrechten en immuniteiten, eveneens bepalingen bevatten ter regeling van de speciale verhoudingen tussen de Organisatie en die Lidstaten.  

### Artikel  X  

####Wijzigingen

1.  De Raad kan aan de Lidstaten wijzigingen aanbevelen van dit Verdrag. Iedere Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie en welke een wijziging wil voorstellen, doet daarvan mededeling aan de President van de Raad. Uiterlijk drie maanden voor een zodanig voorstel door de Raad wordt besproken, stelt de President alle Lidstaten in kennis van de hem meegedeelde wijziging.   
2.  Voor iedere door de Raad aanbevolen wijziging van dit Verdrag is de schriftelijke aanvaarding nodig door alle Lidstaten. Zij wordt van kracht dertig dagen nadat de President van alle Lidstaten mededeling van aanvaarding heeft ontvangen. De President deelt alle Lidstaten, alsmede de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur, mede op welke datum de wijziging van kracht wordt.   
3.  De Raad kan met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten het aan dit Verdrag gehechte Financieel Protocol wijzigen mits een zodanige wijziging niet strijdig is met het Verdrag. Elke zodanige wijziging wordt van kracht op een door de Raad met dezelfde meerderheid van stemmen te bepalen datum. De President van de Raad stelt alle Lidstaten, alsmede de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur, van een zodanige wijziging in kennis alsmede van de datum waarop zij van kracht wordt.   

### Artikel  XI  

####Geschillen

Ieder geschil tussen twee of meer Lidstaten betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet beslecht wordt door de goede diensten van de Raad, wordt voorgelegd aan het Internationale Gerechtshof, tenzij de betrokken Lidstaten overeenstemming bereiken over een andere wijze van beslechting.  

### Artikel  XII  

####Terugtrekking

Nadat dit Verdrag zeven jaar van kracht is geweest, kan een Lidstaat, met inachtneming van het bepaalde in lid 4 van artikel III, de President van de Raad er schriftelijk van in kennis stellen dat hij zich uit de Organisatie terugtrekt; een zodanige terugtrekking wordt van kracht; aan het einde van het boekjaar volgend op dat waarin van de terugtrekking kennis is gegeven, of op een daarvoor door de betrokken Lidstaat voorgesteld later tijdstip.  

### Artikel  XIII  

####Het niet-voldoen aan verplichtingen

Indien een Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie niet voldoet aan zijn uit dit Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen, houdt hij op lid te zijn van de Organisatie krachtens een besluit van de Raad genomen met een twee derde meerderheid van alle Lidstaten.  

### Artikel  XIV  

####Ontbinding

De Organisatie wordt ontbonden indien er op een bepaald ogenblik minder dan vijf Lidstaten zijn. De Organisatie kan te allen tijde worden ontbonden indien daaromtrent overeenstemming wordt bereikt door de Lidstaten. Met inachtneming van een eventuele overeenkomst welke ten tijde van de ontbinding tussen de Lidstaten gesloten kan worden, is de Staat op wiens grondgebied de Organisatie op dat ogenblik is gevestigd, belast met de afwikkeling, en het overschot zal worden verdeeld onder die Staten welke ten tijde van de ontbinding lid van de Organisatie zijn, in de verhouding van de daadwerkelijk door hen betaalde bijdragen vanaf de data waarop zij partij bij dit Verdrag zijn geworden. In het geval dat er een tekort mocht zijn, wordt dit door de Staten welke op dat ogenblik lid zijn van de Organisatie aangevuld, en wel in dezelfde verhouding als die van hun voor het op dat ogenblik lopende boekjaar vastgestelde bijdragen.  

### Artikel  XV  

####Ondertekening

Dit Verdrag en het daaraan gehechte Financieel Protocol dat daarvan een integrerend onderdeel is zal ter ondertekening worden opengesteld tot 31 december 1953 voor iedere Staat welke voldoet aan de in lid 1 van artikel III neergelegde voorwaarden.  

### Artikel  XVI

### BIJLAGE  

### (1)  

####Bijdragen voor de periode eindigende 31 December 1954.

(a).  De Staten welke partij zijn bij dit Verdrag op de datum van zijn inwerkingtreding en alle andere Staten welke tijdens de periode welke eindigt op 31 December 1954 lid worden van de Organisatie, dragen gezamenlijk het totaal der bedragen bij welke nodig zijn volgens de door de Raad krachtens lid 1 van Artikel 4 vastgestelde voorlopige begrotingsregelingen.   
(b).  De bijdragen van de Staten, welke lid zijn van de Organisatie op het ogenblik dat de Raad voor het eerst dergelijke voorlopige begrotingsregelingen vaststelt, zullen voorlopig worden vastgesteld op de basis neergelegd in lid (2) van Artikel 4, met inachtneming van de voorbehouden genoemd in Artikel VII, lid 1 *(b)* (i) en (ii) van het Verdrag, met dien verstande dat in voorbehoud (i) vijf en twintig procent geacht zal worden te zijn vervangen door dertig procent.   
(c).  De bijdragen van de Staten, welke lid worden van de Organisatie gedurende de periode tussen het ogenblik waarop voor de eerste maal voorlopige begrotingsregelingen worden vastgesteld en 31 December 1954 zullen voorlopig op zodanige wijze worden vastgesteld dat de onderlinge verhouding tussen de voorlopige bijdragen van alle Staten-Leden dezelfde zal zijn als die tussen de percentages vermeld in lid (2) van deze Bijlage. Zodanige bijdragen dienen óf, zoals bepaald onder het hierna volgende punt *(d)* om een gedeelte van de voorlopige bijdragen welke reeds door de andere Staten-Leden zijn betaald, terug te betalen, óf ter bestrijding van aanvullende begrotingsuitgaven welke door de Raad gedurende die periode zijn goedgekeurd.

De definitieve bijdragen welke voor de periode eindigende op 31 December 1954 verschuldigd zijn door alle Staten welke op die datum lid zijn van de Organisatie, worden na die datum met terugwerkende kracht vastgesteld op basis van de totale begroting voor genoemde periode zodat die bijdragen die grootte hebben welke zij gehad zouden hebben indien al deze Staten partij bij dit Verdrag zouden zijn geworden op de datum van zijn inwerkingtreding. Elk bedrag dat door een Staat welke lid is van de Organisatie betaald is boven zijn aldus achteraf vastgestelde bijdrage, wordt in het credit van die Staat geboekt.
