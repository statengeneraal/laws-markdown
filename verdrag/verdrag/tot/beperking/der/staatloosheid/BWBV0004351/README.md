####Convention on the reduction of statelessness

The Contracting States, Acting in pursuance of resolution 896 (IX), adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 4 December 1954, Considering it desirable to reduce statelessness by international agreement,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

1.  A Contracting State shall grant its nationality to a person born in its territory who would otherwise be stateless. Such nationality shall be granted: 

(a) at birth, by operation of law, or  

(b) upon an application being lodged with the appropriate authority, by or on behalf of the person concerned, in the manner prescribed by the national law. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, no such application may be rejected.   A Contracting State which provides for the grant of its nationality in accordance with sub-paragraph (*b*) of this paragraph may also provide for the grant of its nationality by operation of law at such age and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the national law.   
2.  A Contracting State may make the grant of its nationality in accordance with sub-paragraph (*b*) of paragraph 1 of this Article subject to one or more of the following conditions: 

(a) that the application is lodged during a period, fixed by the Contracting State, beginning not later than at the age of eighteen years and ending not earlier than at the age of twenty-one years, so, however, that the person concerned shall be allowed at least one year during which he may himself make the application without having to obtain legal authorization to do so;  

(b) that the person concerned has habitually resided in the territory of the Contracting State for such period as may be fixed by that State, not exceeding five years immediately preceding the lodging of the application nor ten years in all;  

(c) that the person concerned has neither been convicted of an offence against national security nor has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years or more on a criminal charge;  

(d) that the person concerned has always been stateless.     
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 (*b*) and 2 of this Article, a child born in wedlock in the territory of a Contracting State, whose mother has the nationality of that State, shall acquire at birth that nationality if it otherwise would be stateless.   
4.  A Contracting State shall grant its nationality to a person who would otherwise be stateless and who is unable to acquire the nationality of the Contracting State in whose territory he was born because he has passed the age for lodging his application or has not fulfilled the required residence conditions, if the nationality of one of his parents at the time of the person's birth was that of the Contracting State first above mentioned. If his parents did not possess the same nationality at the time of his birth, the question whether the nationality of the person concerned should follow that of the father or that of the mother shall be determined by the national law of such Contracting State. If application for such nationality is required, the application shall be made to the appropriate authority by or on behalf of the applicant in the manner prescribed by the national law. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, such application shall not be refused.   
5.  The Contracting State may make the grant of its nationality in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article subject to one or more of the following conditions: 

(a) that the application is lodged before the applicant reaches an age, being not less than twenty-three years, fixed by the Contracting State;  

(b) that the person concerned has habitually resided in the territory of the Contracting State for such period immediately preceding the lodging of the application, not exceeding three years, as may be fixed by that State;  

(c) that the person concerned has always been stateless.     

### Article  2  

A foundling found in the territory of a Contracting State shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be considered to have been born within that territory of parents possessing the nationality of that State.  

### Article  3  

For the purpose of determining the obligations of Contracting States under this Convention, birth on a ship or in an aircraft shall be deemed to have taken place in the territory of the State whose flag the ship flies or in the territory of the State in which the aircraft is registered, as the case may be.  

### Article  4  

1.  A Contracting State shall grant its nationality to a person, not born in the territory of a Contracting State, who would otherwise be stateless, if the nationality of one of his parents at the time of the person's birth was that of that State. If his parents did not possess the same nationality at the time of his birth, the question whether the nationality of the person concerned should follow that of the father or that of the mother shall be determined by the national law of such Contracting State. Nationality granted in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall be granted: 

(a) at birth, by operation of law, or  

(b) upon an application being lodged with the appropriate authority, by or on behalf of the person concerned, in the manner prescribed by the national law. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, no such application may be rejected.     
2.  A Contracting State may make the grant of its nationality in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article subject to one or more of the following conditions: 

(a) that the application is lodged before the applicant reaches an age, being not less than twenty-three years, fixed by the Contracting State;

### Article  5  

1.  If the law of a Contracting State entails loss of nationality as a consequence of any change in the personal status of a person such as marriage, termination of marriage, legitimation, recognition or adoption, such loss shall be conditional upon possession or acquisition of another nationality.   
2.  If, under the law of a Contracting State, a child born out of wedlock loses the nationality of that State in consequence of a recognition of affiliation, he shall be given an opportunity to recover that nationality by written application to the appropriate authority, and the conditions governing such application shall not be more rigorous than those laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 1 of this Convention.   

### Article  6  

If the law of a Contracting State provides for loss of its nationality by a person's spouse or children as a consequence of that person losing or being deprived of that nationality, such loss shall be conditional upon their possession or acquisition of another nationality.  

### Article  7  

1. 
(a) If the law of a Contracting State permits renunciation of nationality, such renunciation shall not result in loss of nationality unless the person concerned possesses or acquires another nationality.  

(b) The provisions of sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph shall not apply where their application would be inconsistent with the principles stated in Articles 13 and 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.     
2.  A national of a Contracting State who seeks naturalization in a foreign country shall not lose his nationality unless he acquires or has been accorded assurance of acquiring the nationality of that foreign country.   
3.  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, a national of a Contracting State shall not lose his nationality, so as to become stateless, on the ground of departure, residence abroad, failure to register or on any similar ground.   
4.  A naturalized person may lose his nationality on account of residence abroad for a period, not less than seven consecutive years, specified by the law of the Contracting State concerned if he fails to declare to the appropriate authority his intention to retain his nationality.   
5.  In the case of a national of a Contracting State, born outside its territory, the law of that State may make the retention of its nationality after the expiry of one year from his attaining his majority conditional upon residence at that time in the territory of the State or registration with the appropriate authority.   
6.  Except in the circumstances mentioned in this Article, a person shall not lose the nationality of a Contracting State, if such loss would render him stateless, notwithstanding that such loss is not expressly prohibited by any other provision of this Convention.   

### Article  8  

1.  A Contracting State shall not deprive a person of its nationality if such deprivation would render him stateless.   
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, a person may be deprived of the nationality of a Contracting State:

(b) where the nationality has been obtained by misrepresentation or fraud.     
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, a Contracting State may retain the right to deprive a person of his nationality, if at the time of signature, ratification or accession it specifies its retention of such right on one or more of the following grounds, being grounds existing in its national law at that time: 

(a) that, inconsistently with his duty of loyalty to the Contracting State, the person 

(i) has, in disregard of an express prohibition by the Contracting State rendered or continued to render services to, or received or continued to receive emoluments from, another State, or  

(ii) has conducted himself in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the State;    

(b) that the person has taken an oath, or made a formal declaration, of allegiance to another State, or given definite evidence of his determination to repudiate his allegiance to the Contracting State.     
4.  A Contracting State shall not exercise a power of deprivation permitted by paragraphs 2 or 3 of this Article except in accordance with law, which shall provide for the person concerned the right to a fair hearing by a court or other independent body.

A Contracting State may not deprive any person or group of persons of their nationality on racial, ethnic, religious or political grounds.  

### Article  10  

1.  Every treaty between Contracting States providing for the transfer of territory shall include provisions designed to secure that no person shall become stateless as a result of the transfer.

####Verdrag tot beperking der staatloosheid

De Verdragsluitende Staten, Handelende overeenkomstig resolutie 896 (IX), aangenomen door de op 4 december 1954 gehouden Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties, Overwegende dat het wenselijk is de staatloosheid door een internationaal akkoord te beperken,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat verleent zijn nationaliteit aan degene die geboren is op zijn grondgebied en die anders staatloos zou zijn. Deze nationaliteit wordt verleend: 

a) van rechtswege, bij de geboorte, of  

b) op een verzoek, door of namens belanghebbende bij de bevoegde autoriteit ingediend op de wijze als door de wetgeving van de betrokken Staat is voorgeschreven; behoudens de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, mag het verzoek niet worden afgewezen.   Een Verdragsluitende Staat welks wetgeving verlening van zijn nationaliteit op verzoek overeenkomstig punt *b* van dit lid kent, kan die nationaliteit ook van rechtswege verlenen bij het bereiken van de leeftijd en op de voorwaarden als in zijn wetgeving zijn vastgesteld.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan de verkrijging van zijn nationaliteit overeenkomstig punt *b* van het eerste lid van dit artikel, aan een of meer van de volgende voorwaarden binden: 

a) dat het verzoek wordt ingediend in de loop van een tijdvak vastgesteld door de Verdragsluitende Staat, welk tijdvak uiterlijk op de leeftijd van 18 jaar aanvangt en niet eerder dan op de leeftijd van 21 jaar eindigt, met dien verstande echter dat de belanghebbende ten minste één jaar de tijd krijgt om zijn verzoek persoonlijk en zonder dat hij daartoe bevoegd behoeft te zijn verklaard in te dienen;  

b) dat de belanghebbende gedurende een door de Verdragsluitende Staat vast te stellen tijdvak zijn gewone verblijf op het grondgebied van die Staat heeft gehad; bedoeld tijdvak mag niet op langer dan tien jaar in totaal worden gesteld, noch op langer dan vijf jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan de indiening van het verzoek;  

c) dat de belanghebbende niet schuldig is verklaard aan een delict tegen de nationale veiligheid, noch is veroordeeld tot een gevangenisstraf van ten minste 5 jaar terzake van een ander strafbaar feit;  

d) dat de belanghebbende bij zijn geboorte of later geen nationaliteit heeft verkregen.     
3.  Ongeacht de bepalingen van het eerste lid sub *b* en van het tweede lid van dit artikel, verkrijgt het wettige kind dat is geboren op het grondgebied van een Verdagsluitende Staat en welks moeder de nationaliteit van die Staat bezit, die nationaliteit bij de geboorte, indien het anders staatloos zou zijn.   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat verleent zijn nationaliteit aan degene, die anders staatloos zou zijn en van wie, ten tijde van de geboorte, de vader of de moeder de nationaliteit van genoemde Staat bezat, indien hij, doordat hij boven de leeftijd is gekomen welke is vastgesteld voor de indiening van zijn verzoek, of doordat hij niet voldoet aan de gestelde voorwaarden met betrekking tot het verblijf, de nationaliteit van de Verdragsluitende Staat op welks grondgebied hij is geboren niet heeft kunnen verkrijgen. Indien de ouders niet dezelfde nationaliteit bezaten ten tijde van de geboorte, volgt naar gelang van de wetgeving van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staat het kind de nationaliteit van de vader dan wel die van de moeder. Indien de nationaliteit moet worden aangevraagd, dient dit verzoek door of namens de belanghebbende bij de bevoegde autoriteit te worden ingediend op de wijze als is voorgeschreven door de wetgeving van de betrokken Staat. Behoudens de bepalingen van het vijfde lid van dit artikel, mag dit verzoek niet worden afgewezen.   
5.  De Verdragsluitende Staat kan het verlenen van zijn nationaliteit overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het vierde lid van dit artikel, binden aan een of meer van de volgende voorwaarden: 

a) dat het verzoek wordt ingediend voordat de belanghebbende een door de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staat vastgestelde leeftijd heeft bereikt, welke leeftijd echter niet beneden de 23 jaar mag liggen;  

b) dat de belanghebbende gedurende een zeker tijdvak onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan de indiening van het verzoek zijn gewone verlijf heeft gehad op het grondgebied van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staat; de duur van dit tijdvak wordt door die Staat vastgesteld, doch mag drie jaar niet te boven gaan;  

c) dat de belanghebbende bij zijn geboorte of later geen nationaliteit heeft verkregen.     

### Artikel  2  

Het kind, gevonden op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt, totdat het tegendeel is bewezen, geacht te zijn geboren op dat grondgebied uit ouders die de nationaliteit van die Staat bezitten.  

### Artikel  3  

Ter vaststelling van de verplichtingen der Verdragsluitende Staten binnen het kader van dit Verdrag wordt een geboorte aan boord van een schip of van een luchtvaartuig geacht te hebben plaats gehad op het grondgebied van de Staat welks vlag het schip voert of waarin het luchtvaartuig staat ingeschreven.

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat verleent zijn nationaliteit aan degene, die anders staatloos zou zijn en niet is geboren op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat, indien ten tijde van de geboorte de vader of de moeder de nationaliteit van de eerstgenoemde Staat bezat. Indien de ouders ten tijde van de geboorte niet dezelfde nationaliteit bezaten, volgt het kind, naar gelang van de wetgeving van die Staat, de nationaliteit van de vader dan wel die van de moeder.

### Artikel  5  

1.  Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat bepaalt dat iemand zijn nationaliteit verliest als gevolg van een wijziging in zijn burgerlijke staat zoals huwelijk, ontbinding van het huwelijk, wettiging, erkenning of adoptie, wordt dat verlies afhankelijk gesteld van het bezit of het verkrijgen van de nationaliteit van een andere Staat.   
2.  Indien overeenkomstig de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat een natuurlijk kind de nationaliteit van die Staat verliest als gevolg van een erkenning, wordt het de mogelijkheid geboden deze terug te krijgen door middel van een daartoe strekkend aan de bevoegde autoriteit gericht verzoek, waarvan de inwilliging niet mag worden gebonden aan de vervulling van strengere voorwaarden dan die, welke worden genoemd in het tweede lid van artikel 1 van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  6  

Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat bepaalt dat, doordat iemand de nationaliteit van die Staat verliest of deze hem wordt ontnomen ook de echtgenoot of de kinderen deze verliezen, wordt dit verlies afhankelijk gesteld van het bezit of het verkrijgen door dezen van de nationaliteit van een andere Staat.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  

a) Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat toelaat dat iemand afstand doet van zijn nationaliteit, dan heeft dit alleen dan verlies van die nationaliteit tot gevolg, indien de betrokkene de nationaliteit van een andere Staat bezit of verkrijgt.  

b) De bepalingen onder punt *a* van dit lid zijn niet van toepassing wanneer zij onverenigbaar zouden blijken te zijn met de beginselen vermeld in de artikelen 13 en 14 van de Universele Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens, welke op 10 december 1948 door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties is goedgekeurd.     
2.  Hij die de nationaliteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat bezit en een verzoek tot naturalisatie in een ander land heeft ingediend, verliest zijn nationaliteit niet, tenzij hij de nationaliteit van dat andere land verkrijgt of de verzekering heeft ontvangen die te zullen verkrijgen.   
3.  Behoudens de bepalingen van het vierde en vijfde lid van dit artikel, zal niemand zijn nationaliteit verliezen op grond van het feit dat hij het land waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, verlaat, in het buitenland woont, zich niet laat inschrijven of op grond van enig ander soortgelijk feit, dat voor hem staatloosheid met zich zou brengen.   
4.  Verlies van de nationaliteit, verkregen door naturalisatie, kan worden gegrond op verblijf in den vreemde gedurende een door de wetgeving van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staat vast te stellen tijdvak van ten minste zeven opeenvolgende jaren, tenzij de belanghebbende de bevoegde autoriteit ervan in kennis stelt dat hij zijn nationaliteit wenst te behouden.   
5.  Met betrekking tot een persoon die geboren is buiten het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, kan de wetgeving van die Staat bepalen, dat deze persoon zijn nationaliteit na verloop van één jaar te rekenen van het tijdstip waarop hij meerderjarig werd, verliest, indien hij op dat moment zijn woonplaats niet heeft op het grondgebied van die Staat of zich niet bij de bevoegde autoriteit heeft laten inschrijven.   
6.  Behoudens het bepaalde in dit artikel verliest niemand de nationaliteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat, indien dit verlies voor hem staatloosheid met zich zou brengen, ook indien dit verlies niet reeds uitdrukkelijk door enige andere bepaling van dit Verdrag is uitgesloten.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat ontneemt een onderdaan de nationaliteit van die Staat niet, indien dit voor die onderdaan staatloosheid met zich zou brengen.   
2.  Ongeacht de bepaling van het eerste lid van dit artikel kan iemand de nationaliteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat worden ontnomen: 

a) in de gevallen waarin het, krachtens de leden 4 en 5 van artikel 7, toegelaten is te bepalen, dat iemand zijn nationaliteit verliest;  

b) indien hij die nationaliteit door middel van een valse verklaring of bedrog heeft verkregen.     
3.  Ongeacht het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel behoudt een Verdragsluitende Staat het recht iemand zijn nationaliteit te ontnemen, indien die Staat ten tijde van de ondertekening of de bekrachtiging van of de toetreding tot dit Verdrag een daartoe strekkende verklaring aflegt onder opgave van de gronden, welke zijn nationale recht voor die ontneming kent en waarvoor de beweegreden is geweest: 

a) dat betrokkene, op een wijze die onverenigbaar is met zijn plicht tot trouw aan de Verdragsluitende Staat, 

(i) in weerwil van een uitdrukkelijk verbod van de Verdragsluitende Staat aan een andere Staat diensten heeft verleend of is blijven verlenen, of van een andere Staat emolumenten heeft ontvangen of is blijven ontvangen, of  

(ii) zich dusdanig heeft gedragen, dat daardoor aan de wezenlijke belangen van de Staat ernstig afbreuk wordt gedaan;    

b) dat betrokkene hetzij een eed, hetzij een stellige verklaring van trouw aan een andere Staat heeft afgelegd, dan wel door zijn gedrag onweerlegbaar heeft doen blijken van zijn besluit de trouw aan de Verdragsluitende Staat op te zeggen.     
4.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat maakt van de mogelijkheid om iemand met inachtneming van de leden 2 en 3 van dit artikel zijn nationaliteit te ontnemen geen gebruik dan met eerbiediging van de wet, waarbij de betrokkene recht heeft op een onpartijdige behandeling van zijn zaak, hetzij door een rechtbank, hetzij door een ander onafhankelijk orgaan.   

### Artikel  9  

Geen Verdragsluitende Staat mag een persoon of een groep personen hun nationaliteit op grond van overwegingen ingegeven door hun ras, ethnologische afkomst, godsdienst of politieke overtuiging ontnemen.  

### Artikel  10  

1.  Ieder tussen Verdragsluitende Staten gesloten verdrag waarin wordt voorzien in de overdracht van grondgebied, dient bepalingen te bevatten ter verzekering dat niemand tengevolge van die overdracht staatloos wordt. Een Verdragsluitende Staat dient al het mogelijke te doen ter verzekering dat in elk zodanig verdrag dat hij met een Staat die geen partij is bij het onderhavige Verdrag sluit, bepalingen als hierboven bedoeld worden opgenomen.   
2.  Indien bepalingen van deze strekking ontbreken, verleent de Verdragsluitende Staat waaraan grondgebied wordt overgedragen of die op andere wijze grondgebied verkrijgt, zijn nationaliteit aan hen die anders tengevolge van de overdracht of de verkrijging, staatloos zouden worden.   

### Artikel  11  

De Verdragsluitende Staten bevorderen dat binnen het raam van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties, zo spoedig mogelijk na de nederlegging van de zesde akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding een orgaan wordt ingesteld, waartoe iemand die zich op dit Verdrag wenst te beroepen zich, zowel voor onderzoek van zijn beroep als voor bijstand bij het voorleggen van zijn zaak aan het bevoegde gezag, kan wenden.  

### Artikel  12  

1.  Ten aanzien van een Verdragsluitende Staat die niet overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het eerste lid van artikel 1 of die van artikel 4 van dit Verdrag zijn nationaliteit van rechtswege bij de geboorte verleent, zijn de bepalingen van het eerste lid van artikel 1 of die van artikel 4 van toepassing zowel op personen die geboren zijn vóór, als op personen die geboren zijn na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag.   
2.  De bepalingen van het vierde lid van artikel 1 van dit Verdrag zijn van toepassing zowel op personen die geboren zijn vóór, als op personen die geboren zijn na de inwerkingtreding daarvan.   
3.  De bepalingen van artikel 2 van dit Verdrag zijn uitsluitend van toepassing op kinderen gevonden op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat na het in werking treden van het Verdrag.   

### Artikel  13  

Dit Verdrag laat eventuele bepalingen, die in nog sterkere mate de beperking der staatloosheid bevorderen en thans zijn of later mochten worden opgenomen, hetzij in de wetgeving van een der Verdragsluitende Staten, hetzij in een Verdrag, overeenkomst of regeling tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten, onverlet.  

### Artikel  14

Met ingang van de dag waarop bedoelde kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal wordt ontvangen is dit Verdrag op de in die kennisgeving genoemde gebieden van toepassing.   
3.  Na het verstrijken van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel genoemde termijn van twaalf maanden stellen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staten de Secretaris-Generaal in kennis van de resultaten van het overleg dat is gevoerd met die niet tot het moederland behorende gebieden, voor de internationale betrekkingen waarvan zij verantwoordelijk zijn en die met de toepasselijkheid van dit Verdrag niet hebben ingestemd.
