### Article  1  

The High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to apply, for the settlement of the conflicts of laws hereinafter mentioned, in connection with cheques, the rules set out in the following Articles.  

### Article  2  

The capacity of a person to bind himself by a cheque shall be determined by his national law. If this national law provides that the law of another country is competent in the matter, this latter law shall be applied. A person who lacks capacity, according to the law specified in the preceding paragraph, is nevertheless bound if his signature has been given in any territory in which, according to the law in force there, he would have the requisite capacity. Each of the High Contracting Parties may refuse to recognise the validity of a contract by means of a cheque entered into by one of his nationals which would not be deemed valid in the territory of the other High Contracting Parties otherwise than by means of the application of the preceding paragraph of the present Article.  

### Article  3  

The law of the country in which the cheque is payable determines the persons on whom a cheque may be drawn. If, under this law, the instrument is not valid as a cheque by reason of the person on whom it is drawn, the obligations arising out of the signatures affixed thereto in other countries whose laws provide otherwise shall nevertheless be valid.  

### Article  4  

The form of any contract arising out of a cheque is regulated by the laws of the territory in which the contract has been signed. Nevertheless, it shall be sufficient if the forms prescribed by the law of the place of payment are observed. If, however, the obligations entered into by means of a cheque are not valid according to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, but are in conformity with the laws of the territory in which a subsequent contract has been entered into, the circumstance that the previous contracts are irregular in form shall not invalidate the subsequent contract. Each of the High Contracting Parties may prescribe that contracts by means of a cheque entered into abroad by one of his nationals shall be valid, in respect of another of his nationals in his territory, provided that they are in the form laid down by the national law.  

### Article  5  

The law of the country in whose territory the obligations arising out of a cheque have been assumed shall determine the effects of such obligations.  

### Article  6  

The limits of time for the exercise of rights of recourse shall be determined for all signatories by the law of the place where the instrument was created.  

### Article  7  

The law of the country in which the cheque is payable shall determine: 

(1) Whether a cheque must necessarily be payable at sight or whether it can be drawn payable at a fixed period after sight, and also what the effects are of the post-dating of a cheque;  

(2) The limit of time for presentment;  

(3) Whether a cheque can be accepted, certified, confirmed or visaed, and what the effects are respectively of such acceptance, certification, confirmation or visa;  

(4) Whether the holder may demand, and whether he is bound to accept, partial payment;  

(5) Whether a cheque can be crossed or marked either with the words „payable in account” or with some equivalent expression, and what the effects are of such crossing or of the words „payable in account” or any equivalent expression;  

(6) Whether the holder has special rights to the cover and what the nature is of these rights;  

(7) Whether the drawer may countermand payment of a cheque or take proceedings to stop its payment (*opposition*);  

(8) The measures to be taken in case of loss or theft of a cheque;  

(9) Whether a protest or any equivalent declaration is necessary in order to preserve the right of recourse against the endorsers, the drawer and the other parties liable.    

### Article  8  

The form of and the limits of time for protest, as well as the form of the other measures necessary for the exercise or preservation of rights concerning cheques, shall be regulated by the law of the country in whose territory the protest must be drawn up or the measures in question taken.  

### Article  9  

Each of the High Contracting Parties reserves the right not to apply the principles of private international law contained in the present Convention so far as concerns: 

(1) An obligation undertaken outside the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties;  

(2) Any law which may be applicable in accordance with these principles and which is not a law in force in the territory of any High Contracting Party.    

### Article  10  

In the territory of each of the High Contracting Parties the provisions of the present Convention shall not apply to cheques already issued at the time of the coming into force of the present Convention.  

### Article  11  

The present Convention, the French and English texts of which shall be equally authentic, shall bear this day's date. It may be signed thereafter until July 15th, 1931, on behalf of any Member of the League of Nations or non-member State.  

### Article  12  

The present Convention shall be ratified. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited before September 1st, 1933, with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who shall forthwith notify receipt thereof to all the Members of the League of Nations and to the non-member States on whose behalf the present Convention has been signed or acceded to.  

### Article  13  

As from July 15th, 1931, any Member of the League of Nations and any non-member State may accede thereto. Such accession shall be effected by a notification to the Secretary General of the League of Nations, such notification to be deposited in the archives of the Secretariat. The Secretary-General shall notify such deposit forthwith to all the Members of the League of Nations and to the non-member States on whose behalf the present Convention has been signed or acceded to.

Every ratification or accession effected after the entry into force of the Convention in accordance with Article 14 shall take effect on the ninetieth day following the date of receipt thereof by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.  

### Article  16  

The present Convention may not be denounced before the expiry of two years from the date on which it has entered into force in respect of that Member of the League or non-member State; such denunciation shal take effect as from the ninetieth day following the receipt by the Secretary-General of the notification addressed to him. Every denunciation shall be immediately communicated by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to all the Members of the League of Nations and to the non-member States on whose behalf the present Convention has been signed or acceded to. Each denunciation shall take effect only as regards the Member of the League of Nations or the non-member State, on whose behalf it has been made.  

### Article  17  

Every Member of the League of Nations and every non-member State in respect of which the present Convention is in force, may forward to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, after the expiry of the fourth year following the entry into force of the Convention, a request for the revision of some or all of the provisions of that Convention. If such request, after being communicated to the other Members or non-member States between whom the Convention is at that time in force, is supported within one year by at least six of them, the Council of the League of Nations shall decide whether a Conference shall be convened for the purpose.  

### Article  18  

Any High Contracting Party may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare that, in accepting the present Convention, he does not assume any obligations in respect of all or any of his colonies, protectorates or territories under suzerainty or mandate; and the present Convention shall not apply to any territories named in such declaration. Any High Contracting Party may give notice to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations at any time subsequently that he desires that the Convention shall apply to all or any of his territories which have been made the subject of a declaration under the preceding paragraph, and the Convention shall apply to all the territories named in such notice ninety days after its receipt by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Any High Contracting Party may at any time declare that he desires that the present Convention shall cease to apply to all or any of his colonies, protectorates or territories under suzerainty or mandate and the Convention shall cease to apply to the territories named in such declaration one year after its receipt by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.

####Verdrag tot regeling van zekere wetsconflicten ten aanzien van chèques.

*(Opsomming van Staatshoofden.)*  Verlangend regelen aan te nemen tot oplossing van zekere wetsconflicten ten aanzien van chèques, hebben als hun Gevolmachtigden aangewezen:  *(Lijst van Gevolmachtigden.)*    Die, na elkander hun in goeden en behoorlijken vorm bevonden volmachten te hebben medegedeeld, omtrent de volgende bepalingen zijn overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

De Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich jegens elkander voor de oplossing der hieronder genoemde wetsconflicten ten aanzien van chèques, de in de volgende artikelen opgesomde regelen toe te passen.  

### Artikel  2  

De bekwaamheid van een persoon om zich bij chèque te verbinden wordt bepaald door zijn nationale wet. Indien deze nationale wet de wet van een ander land bevoegd verklaart, is deze laatste wet toepasselijk. De persoon, die onbekwaam zou zijn volgens de wet, in het voorgaande lid genoemd, is desniettemin rechtsgeldig verbonden, indien de handteekening is geplaatst op het grondgebied van een land, volgens welks wetgeving de persoon bekwaam zou zijn geweest. Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen is bevoegd, de rechtsgeldigheid te ontkennen van een door ëén harer onderdanen aangegane verbintenis ten aanzien van chèques, welke op het grondgebied der andere Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen slechts door toepassing van het voorgaande lid van dit artikel geldig zou zijn.  

### Artikel  3  

De wet van het land, waar de chèque betaalbaar is, wijst de personen aan, op wie eene chèque kan worden getrokken. Indien, volgens deze wet, de titel nietig is als chèque met het oog op den persoon, op wien zij is getrokken, zijn niettemin geldig de verbintenissen, voortvloeiende uit de handteekeningen, daarop gesteld in andere landen, wier wetten genoemde bepaling niet bevatten.  

### Artikel  4  

De vorm der verbintenissen ten aanzien van chèques aangegaan, wordt beoordeeld naar de wet van het land, op welks grondgebied die verbintenissen zijn onderteekend. Het is evenwel voldoende, indien de op de plaats van betaling voorgeschreven vormen in acht zijn genomen. Indien echter de op eene chèque aangegane verbintenissen volgens de bepalingen van het voorgaande lid niet rechtsgeldig zijn, doch in overeenstemming zijn met de wetgeving van den Staat, waar een latere verbintenis is onderteekend, doet de omstandigheid, dat de eerst aangegane verbintenissen, wat vorm betreft, ongeldig zijn, geen afbreuk aan de geldigheid van de later aangegane verbintenis. Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen is bevoegd te bepalen, dat de verbintenissen ten aanzien van chèques door een harer onderdanen in het buitenland aangegaan, tegenover een van haar andere onderdanen op haar grondgebied geldig zullen zijn, mits zij worden aangegaan in den vorm, door de nationale wet voorgeschreven.  

### Artikel  5  

De wet van het land, op welks grondgebied de uit de chèque voortvloeiende verbintenissen zijn onderteekend, regelt de rechtsgevolgen dier verbintenissen.  

### Artikel  6  

De termijnen tot uitoefening van het recht van regres worden ten aanzien van alle onderteekenaren bepaald door de wet van het land, waar het stuk is uitgegeven.  

### Artikel  7  

De wet van het land, waar de chèque betaalbaar is, bepaalt: 

1° of de chèque noodzakelijkerwijs op zicht betaalbaar is, dan wel of zij op zekeren tijd na zicht kan worden getrokken, alsmede, welke de rechtsgevolgen zijn van eene postdateering;  

2° den termijn van aanbieding;  

3° of de chèque kan worden geaccepteerd, gecertifieerd, bekrachtigd of geviseerd, en welke rechtsgevolgen zijn van de vermelding dier handelingen;  

4° of de houder een gedeeltelijke betaling kan eischen en of hij verplicht is een gedeeltelijke betaling aan te nemen;  

5° of de chèque kan worden gekruist of worden voorzien van de clausule: „in rekening te brengen”, of een daarmede gelijkstaande uitdrukking, en welke de rechtsgevolgen zijn van die kruising, van die clausule of van die daarmede gelijkstaande uitdrukking;  

6° of de houder bijzondere rechten heeft op het fonds, en van welken aard deze rechten zijn;  

7° of de houder de chèque kan herroepen of verzet kan doen tegen de betaling;  

8° de maatregelen te nemen in geval van verlies of diefstal van de chèque;  

9° of een protest of een daarmede gelijkstaande verklaring noodzakelijk is voor het behoud van het recht van regres tegen de endossanten, den trekker en de overige chèqueschuldenaren.    

### Artikel  8  

De vorm en de termijnen van het protest, alsmede de vorm der andere handelingen, welke noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitoefening of voor het behoud van de rechten ten aanzien van chèques, worden beheerscht door de wetten van het land, op welks grondgebied het protest moet worden opgemaakt of bedoelde handeling worden verricht.  

### Artikel  9  

Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen behoudt zich de bevoegdheid voor om de door dit Verdrag gehuldigde beginselen van internationaal privaatrecht niet toe te passen, voor zooverre betreft: 

1° een buiten het grondgebied van een der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen aangegane verbintenis;  

2° een wet, welke toepasselijk zou zijn overeenkomstig deze beginselen en welke niet die van een der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen zou zijn.    

### Artikel  10  

Op het grondgebied van ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag niet toepasselijk zijn op chèques, welke reeds op het oogenblik van de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag zijn uitgegeven.

### Artikel  15  

Iedere bekrachtiging of toetreding, welke zal geschieden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag overeenkomstig artikel 14, zal van kracht zijn te rekenen van af den negentigsten dag, volgende op den datum van haar ontvangst door den Secretaris-Generaal van den Volkenbond.  

### Artikel  16  

Behoudens in geval van dringende noodzakelijkheid, kan dit Verdrag niet worden opgezegd voor het einde van een termijn van twee jaren, te rekenen van af den datum zijner inwerkingtreding voor het Lid van den Volkenbond of voor den Staat niet-Lid, die tot opzegging overgaat; deze opzegging zal van kracht worden te rekenen van af den negentigsten dag, volgende op de ontvangst door den Secretaris-Generaal van de tot hem gerichte kennisgeving. Iedere opzegging zal onmiddellijk door den Secretaris-Generaal van den Volkenbond worden medegedeeld aan alle Leden van den Volkenbond en aan de Staten niet-Leden, in wier naam dit Verdrag is onderteekend of in wier naam de toetreding heeft plaats gehad. Iedere opzegging zal slechts van kracht zijn voor het Lid van den Volkenbond of voor den Staat niet-Lid, namens welke zij zal hebben plaats gehad.
