The form of any contract arising out of a bill of exchange or promissory note is regulated by the laws of the territory in which the contract has been signed. If, however, the obligations entered into by means of a bill of exchange or promissory note are not valid according to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, but are in conformity with the laws of the territory in which a subsequent contract has been entered into, the circumstance that the previous contracts are irregular in form does not invalidate the subsequent contract.

### Article  5

### Article  6

### Article  7  

The question whether acceptance may be restricted to part of the sum or whether the holder is bound to accept partial payment is governed by the law of the country in which the bill of exchange is payable. The same rule governs the payment of promissory notes.

The form of and the limits of time for protest, as well as the form of the other measures necessary for the exercise or preservation of rights concerning bills of exchange or promissory notes, are regulated by the laws of the contry in which the protest must be drawn up or the measures in question taken.

### Artikel  2  

De bekwaamheid van een persoon om zich bij wisselbrief en orderbriefje te verbinden wordt bepaald door zijn nationale wet. Indien deze nationale wet de wet van een ander land bevoegd verklaart, is deze laatste wet toepasselijk. De persoon, die onbekwaam zou zijn volgens de wet in het voorgaande lid genoemd, is desniettemin rechtsgeldig verbonden, indien de handteekening is geplaatst op het grondgebied van een land, volgens welks wetgeving de persoon bekwaam zou zijn geweest. Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen is bevoegd de rechtsgeldigheid niet te erkennen van een door één harer onderdanen aangegane verbintenis ten aanzien van wisselbrieven en orderbriefjes, welke op het grondgebied der andere Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen slechts door toepassing van het voorgaande lid van dit artikel geldig zou zijn.  

### Artikel  3  

De vorm der verbintenissen ten aanzien van wisselbrieven en orderbriefjes aangegaan, wordt beoordeeld naar de wet van het land, op welks grondgebied die verbintenissen zijn onderteekend. Indien echter de op een wisselbrief of een orderbriefje aangegane verbintenissen volgens de bepalingen van het voorgaande lid niet rechtsgeldig zijn, doch in overeenstemming zijn met de wetgeving van den Staat, waar een latere verbintenis is onderteekend, doet de omstandigheid, dat de eerst aangegane verbintenissen, wat vorm betreft, ongeldig zijn, geen afbreuk aan de geldigheid van de later aangegane verbintenis. Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen is bevoegd te bepalen, dat de verbintenissen ten aanzien van wisselbrieven en orderbriefjes door een harer onderdanen in het buitenland aangegaan, tegenover een van haar andere onderdanen op haar grondgebied geldig zullen zijn, mits zij worden aangegaan in den vorm, door de nationale wet voorgeschreven.  

### Artikel  4  

De rechtsgevolgen der verplichtingen van den acceptant van een wisselbrief en van den onderteekenaar van een orderbriefje worden bepaald door de wet van de plaats, waar die titels betaalbaar zijn. De rechtsgevolgen, die de handteekeningen der andere uit den wisselbrief of het orderbriefje verbonden personen met zich brengen, worden bepaald door de wet van het land, op welks grondgebied de handteekeningen zijn geplaatst.  

### Artikel  5  

De termijnen tot uitoefening van het recht van regres worden ten aanzien van alle onderteekenaren beheerscht door de wet van de plaats van uitgifte van den titel.  

### Artikel  6  

De vraag, of de houder van een wisselbrief de schuldvordering verkrijgt, welke aanleiding heeft gegeven tot het uitgeven van den titel, wordt bepaald door de wet van de plaats van uitgifte van den titel.  

### Artikel  7  

De vraag, of de acceptatie kan worden beperkt tot een gedeelte van de som, en of de houder al dan niet verplicht is een gedeeltelijke betaling aan te nemen, wordt beoordeeld naar de wet van het land, waar de wisselbrief betaalbaar is. Dezelfde regel is van toepassing ten aanzien van de betaling van het orderbriefje.  

### Artikel  8  

De vorm en de termijnen van het protest, alsmede de vorm der andere handelingen, welke noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitoefening of voor het behoud van de rechten ten aanzien van wisselbrief of orderbriefje, worden beheerscht door de wetten van het land, op welks grondgebied het protest moet worden opgemaakt of de bedoelde handeling worden verricht.  

### Artikel  9  

De maatregelen, welke genomen moeten worden in geval van verlies of diefstal van den wisselbrief of het orderbriefje, worden bepaald door de wet van de plaats, waar het wisselbriefje of de orderbrief betaalbaar zijn.  

### Artikel  10  

Ieder der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen behoudt zich de bevoegdheid voor om de door dit Verdrag gehuldigde beginselen van internationaal privaatrecht niet toe te passen voor zooverre betreft: 

1° een buiten het grondgebied van een der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen aangegane verbintenis;  

2° een wet, welke toepasselijk zou zijn overeenkomstig deze beginselen en welke niet die van een der Hooge Verdragsluitende Partijen zou zijn.    

### Artikel  11
