####Extent of the Convention.

### Article  1  

The area to which this Convention applies shall be all waters which are situated within those parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and their dependent seas which lie north of 48 degrees north latitude and between 42 degrees west longitude and 32 degrees east longitude, but excluding the Baltic Sea and Belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from Hasenore Head to Gniben Point, from Korshage to Spodsbierg and from Gilbierg Head to the Kullen.  

### Article  2  

Nothing in the present Convention shall be deemed to diminish the exclusive rights of vessels registered or owned in the territory of each Contracting Government to fish in waters where that Contracting Government has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries.  

### Article  3  

Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to prejudice the claims of any Contracting Government in regard to the limits of territorial waters.  

### Part  II  

####Regulation of the Meshes of Fishing Nets and the Size Limits of Fish

### Article  4  

Subject to the provisions of Articles 8, 10 and 16 (2), the provisions of this Convention shall apply to all vessels of any Contracting Government either when they are operating in the waters where that Contracting Government has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries, or when they are operating outside such waters.  

### Article  5  

No vessel shall carry on board or use any trawl, seine or other net towed or hauled at or near the bottom of the sea which has in any part of the net meshes of dimensions less than those specified in Annex I to this Convention.  

### Article  6  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5, vessels fishing for mackerel, clupeoid fishes, sand eels (*Ammodytes*), Norway pout (*Gadus esmarkii*), smelts, eels, great weevers (*Trachinus draco*), shrimps, prawns, nephrops or molluscs, may carry on board and use nets having meshes of dimensions less than those so specified: provided that (*a*) any fishing instruments used by such vessels for the capture of any of the fish described in this Article shall not be used for the purpose of capturing other kinds of fish; and (*b*) any fish in excess of the percentages set out in Annex III to this Convention, of the species set out in Annex II to this Convention, which may be captured by such instruments and which are of less than the minimum sizes prescribed in Annex II to this Convention shall be returned to the sea immediately after capture; and (*c*) provided that in the period from 1st June, 1963 to 1st June, 1966, no nets having in the cod-end meshes of dimensions between 50 mm (irrespective of material used) and the minimum sizes specified in Annex I shall be carried or used by vessels in the waters of that part of the Convention area defined in that paragraph, except - 

(i) those waters to the south and west of the following lines: a line drawn due west from the Mull of Galloway along 54° 38' north latitude, and a line drawn from France to England along 2° west longitude;  

(ii) those waters east of a line drawn from Hanstholm to Lindesnes.    

### Article  7  

(1).  No vessel while operating shall use any device by means of which the mesh in any part to a fishing net to which Article 5 of this Convention applies is obstructed or otherwise in effect diminished.   
(2).  Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing paragraph it shall not be deemed unlawful: 

(i) to attach to the underside of the cod-end of a trawl net any canvas, netting, or other material, for the purpose of preventng or reducing wear or tear; and as from 1st January, 1959, and until 1ste June, 1965, and only for trawl nets with a mesh of 100 mm. or more:  

(ii) to attach a rectangular piece of netting to the upper side of the cod-end of a trawl net to reduce and prevent damage so long as such netting conforms to the following conditions: 

(a) this netting shall not have a mesh size less than that specified for the net itself;  

(b) the netting may be fastened to the cod-end only along the forward and lateral edges of the netting and at no other place in it, and shall be fastened in such a manner that it extends forward of the splitting strop no more than four meshes and ends not less than four meshes in front of the cod-line mesh; where a splitting strop is not used the netting shall not extend to more than one-third of the cod-end measured from not less than four meshes in front of the cod-line mesh;  

(c) the number of meshes in the width of the netting shall be at least one and a half times the number of meshes in the width of that part of the cod-end which is covered, both widths being taken at right angles to the long axis of the cod-end.       

### Article  8  

Subject to the provisions of Annex III to this Convention, no vessel shall retain on board any sea fish of the descriptions set out in Annex II to this Convention, of a less size than the size prescribed therein for each fish, and all such fish shall be returned immediately to the sea; provided that they may be retained on board for the purpose of transplantation to other fishing grounds.
