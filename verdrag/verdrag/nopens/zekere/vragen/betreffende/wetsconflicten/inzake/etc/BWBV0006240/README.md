### CHAPTER  I  

####— General principles.

### Article  1  

It is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals. This law shall be recognised by other States in so far as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom, and the principles of law generally recognised with regard to nationality.  

### Article  2  

Any question as to whether a person possesses the nationality of a particular State shall be determined in accordance with the law of that State.  

### Article  3  

Subject to the provisions of the present Convention, a person having two or more nationalities may be regarded as its national by each of the States whose nationality he possesses.  

### Article  4  

A State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against a State whose nationality such person also possesses.  

### Article  5  

Within a third State, a person having more than one nationality shall be treated as if he had only one. Without prejudice to the application of its law in matters of personal status and of any conventions in force, a third State shall, of nationalities which any such person possesses, recognise exclusively in its territory either the nationality of the country in which he is habitually and principally resident, or the nationality of the country with which in the circumstances he appears to be in fact most closely connected.  

### Article  6  

Without prejudice to the liberty of a State to accord wider rights to renounce its nationality, a person possessing two nationalities acquired without any voluntary act on his part may renounce one of them with the authorisation of the State whose nationality he desires to surrender. This authorisation may not be refused in the case of a person who has his habitual and principal residence abroad, if the conditions laid down in the law of the State whose nationality he desires to surrender are satisfied.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####— Expatriation permits.

### Article  7  

In so far as the law of a State provides for the issue of an expatriation permit, such a permit shall not entail the loss of the nationality of the State which issues it, unless the person to whom it is issued possesses another nationality or unless and until he acquires another nationality. An expatriation permit shall lapse if the holder does not acquire a new nationality within the period fixed by the State which has issued the permit. This provision shall not apply in the case of an individual who, at the time when he receives the expatriation permit, already possesses a nationality other than that of the State by which the permit is issued to him. The State whose nationality is acquired by a person to whom an expatriation permit has been issued, shall notify such acquisition to the State which has issued the permit.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####— Nationality of married women.

### Article  8  

If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring the nationality of the husband.  

### Article  9  

If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a change in the nationality of her husband occuring during marriage, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husband's new nationality.  

### Article  10  

Naturalisation of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent.  

### Article  11  

The wife who, under the law of her country, lost her nationality on marriage shall not recover it after the dissolution of the marriage except on her own application and in accordance with the law of that country. If she does recover it, she shall lose the nationality which she acquired by reason of the marriage.  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####— Nationality of children.

### Article  12  

Rules of law which confer nationality by reason of birth on the territory of a State shall not apply automatically to children born to persons enjoying diplomatic immunities in the country where the birth occurs. The law of each State shall permit children of consuls *de carrière*, or of officials of foreign States charged with official missions by their Governments, to become divested, by repudiation or otherwise, of the nationality of the State in which they were born, in any case in which on birth they acquired dual nationality, provided that they retain the nationality of their parents.  

### Article  13  

Naturalisation of the parents shall confer on such of their children as, according to its law, are minors the nationality of the State by which the naturalisation is granted. In such case the law of that State may specify the conditions governing the acquisition of its nationality by the minor children as a result of the nationalisation of the parents. In cases where minor children do not acquire the nationality of their parents as the result of the naturalisation of the latter, they shall retain their existing nationality.  

### Article  14  

A child whose parents are both unknown shall have the nationality of the country of birth. If the child's parentage is established, its nationality shall be determined by the rules applicable in cases where the parentage is known. A foundling is, until the contrary is proved, presumed to have been born on the territory of the State in which it was found.  

### Article  15  

Where the nationality of a State is not acquired automatically by reason of birth on its territory, a child born on the territory of that State of parents having no nationality, or of unknown nationality, may obtain the nationality of the said State. The law of that State shall determine the conditions governing the acquisition of its nationality in such cases.  

### Article  16  

If the law of the State, whose nationality an illegitimate child possesses, recognises that such nationality may be lost as a consequence of a change in the civil status of the child (legitimation, recognition), such loss shall be conditional on the acquisition by the child of the nationality of another State under the law of such State relating to the effect upon nationality of changes in civil status.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####— Adoption.

### Article  17  

If the law of a State recognises that its nationality may be lost as the result of adoption, this loss shall be conditional upon the acquisition by the person adopted of the nationality of the person by whom he is adopted, under the law of the State of which the latter is a national relating to the effect of adoption upon nationality.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####— General and final provisions.

### Article  18  

The High Contracting Parties agree to apply the principles and rules contained in the preceding articles in their relations with each other, as from the date of the entry into force of the present Convention. The inclusion of the above-mentioned principles and rules in the Convention shall in no way be deemed to prejudice the question whether they do or do not already form part of international law.

### Article  21  

II there should arise between the High Contracting Parties a dispute of any kind relating to the interpretation or application of the present Convention and if such dispute cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, it shall be settled in accordance with any applicable agreements in force between the parties providing for the settlement of international disputes. In case there is no such agreement in force between the parties, the dispute shall be referred to arbitration or judicial settlement, in accordance with the constitutional procedure of each of the parties to the dispute. In the absence of agreement on the choice of another tribunal, the dispute shall be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, if all the parties to the dispute are parties to the Protocol of the 16th December, 1920, relating to the Statute of that Court, and if any of the parties to the dispute is not a party to the Protocol of the 16th December, 1920, the dispute shall be referred to an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with the Hague Convention of the 18th October, 1907, for the Pacific Settlement of International Conflicts.

####VERDRAG NOPENS ZEKERE VRAGEN BETREFFENDE WETSCONFLICTEN INZAKE NATIONALITEIT.

*[Zie voor een opsomming van Staatshoofden de Engelse tekst.]*  Overwegende dat het van belang zou zijn, bij internationale overeenkomst de vragen betreffende wetsconflicten nopens de nationaliteit te regelen; Overtuigd dat het in het algemeen belang van de internationale gemeenschap is, dat door alle leden van deze gemeenschap wordt erkend, dat ieder persoon een nationaliteit en wel slechts één nationaliteit behoort te bezitten; Dientengevolge erkennende, dat het ideaal, waarnaar de menschheid op dit gebied moet streven, is de opheffing van alle gevallen van staatloosheid en van dubbele nationaliteit; Van oordeel, dat onder de economische en maatschappelijke omstandigheden, die op het oogenblik in de verschillende landen aanwezig zijn, het niet mogelijk is, reeds thans over te gaan tot een eenvormige regeling van alle bovenbedoelde vraagstukken; Desniettemin verlangend dit groote werk te beginnen met een eerste poging tot geleidelijke codificatie door het regelen van die vragen met betrekking tot de wetsconflicten nopens de nationaliteit, waaromtrent op dit oogenblik een internationale regeling mogelijk is, Hebben besloten een Verdrag te sluiten en te dien einde als hun gevolmachtigden benoemd:  *[Zie voor de lijst van gevolmachtigden de Engelse tekst.]*    Die, na hun in goeden en behoorlijken vorm bevonden volmachten te hebben overgelegd, omtrent de volgende bepalingen zijn overeengekomen:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####— Algemeene beginselen.

### Artikel  1  

Het behoort tot de bevoegdheid van iederen Staat in zijn wetgeving te bepalen, wie zijn onderdanen zijn. Deze wetgeving moet door de andere Staten worden erkend, voor zoover zij in overeenstemming is met de internationale verdragen, de internationale gewoonte en de algemeen erkende rechtsbeginselen ter zake van nationaliteit.  

### Artikel  2  

Iedere vraag of een persoon de nationaliteit van een Staat bezit, moet worden beantwoord overeenkomstig de wetgeving van dezen Staat.  

### Artikel  3  

Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag zal een persoon, die twee of meer nationaliteiten bezit, door ieder van de Staten, waarvan hij de nationaliteit heeft, als zijn onderdaan kunnen worden beschouwd.  

### Artikel  4  

Een Staat kan zijn diplomatieke bescherming met uitoefenen ten gunste van één van zijn onderdanen tegenover een Staat, waarvan deze persoon eveneens de nationaliteit bezit.  

### Artikel  5  

In een derden Staat zal een persoon, die twee of meer nationaliteiten bezit, moeten worden behandeld alsof hij er slechts één had. Onverminderd de rechtsregelen, die in den derden Staat ter zake van het personeel statuut worden toegepast, en onder voorbehoud van de geldende verdragen zal deze Staat op zijn grondgebied van de nationaliteiten, die een zoodanige persoon bezit, uitsluitend erkennen hetzij de nationaliteit van het land, waarin de persoon zijn gewone en voornaamste verblijfplaats heeft, hetzij de nationaliteit van het land, waartoe hij geacht mag worden in de nauwste betrekking te staan.  

### Artikel  6  

Onder voorbehoud van het recht van een Staat ruimere bevoegdheden te geven tot het verwerpen van nationaliteit, zal ieder persoon, die twee nationaliteiten bezit, welke hij verworven heeft zonder dat hij zijnerzijds hiertoe den wil te kennen heeft gegeven, één van deze beide nationaliteiten kunnen verwerpen met machtiging van den Staat, wiens nationaliteit hij voornemens is te verwerpen. Deze machtiging zal niet geweigerd worden aan den persoon, die zijn gewoon- en hoofdverblijf heeft in het buitenland, mits voldaan zal zijn aan de voorwaarden vereischt door de wet van den Staat, wiens nationaliteit hij wenscht te verwerpen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####— Verlof tot uittreden uit het Staatsverband.

### Artikel  7  

Het verlof tot uittreden uit het Staatsverband, voorzoover dit in een wetgeving wordt voorzien, brengt alleen dan verlies van nationaliteit van den Staat, die het verlof heeft gegeven, mede, indien de houder van het verlof reeds een tweede nationaliteit bezit, of, indien dit niet het geval is, van het oogenblik af waarop hij een nieuwe nationaliteit verkrijgt. Het verlof tot uittreden uit het Staatsverband vervalt, indien de houder niet een nieuwe nationaliteit verkrijgt binnen den termijn, welke vastgesteld is door den Staat, die het verlof heeft verleend. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing in het geval van een persoon, die op het oogenblik waarop hij het verlof tot uittreden uit het Staatsverband ontvangt, reeds een andere nationaliteit bezit dan die van den Staat, die hem het verlof geeft. De Staat, waarvan de nationaliteit wordt verkregen door een persoon, aan wien een verlof tot uittreden uit het Staatsverband is gegeven, zal het verkrijgen van deze nieuwe nationaliteit mededeelen aan den Staat, die het verlof heeft verleend.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####— De nationaliteit van de gehuwde vrouw.

### Artikel  8  

Indien de nationale wet van de vrouw haar hare nationaliteit doet verliezen ingevolge huwelijk met een vreemdeling, zal dit gevolg afhankelijk worden gesteld van het verkrijgen door haar van de nationaliteit van haar echtgenoot.  

### Artikel  9  

Indien de nationale wet van de vrouw haar hare nationaliteit doet verliezen ingevolge verandering van nationaliteit van haar echtgenoot tijdens het huwelijk, zal dit gevolg afhankelijk worden gesteld van het verkrijgen door haar van de nieuwe nationaliteit van haar echtgenoot.  

### Artikel  10  

De naturalisatie van den echtgenoot tijdens het huwelijk zal alleen met de toestemming van de echtgenoote verandering van nationaliteit van deze laatste medebrengen.  

### Artikel  11  

De vrouw, die volgens de wet van haar land haar nationaliteit heeft verloren ingevolge haar huwelijk, verkrijgt na ontbinding van het huwelijk deze nationaliteit alleen terug, indien zij hiertoe het verzoek doet, en in overeenstemming met de wet van dit land. In geval zij haar nationaliteit terug verkrijgt, verliest zij de nationaliteit, die zij ingevolge haar huwelijk had verkregen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####— De nationaliteit der kinderen.

### Artikel  12  

De wettelijke bepalingen nopens het toekennen van de nationaliteit van een Staat ingevolge geboorte op het grondgebied van dien Staat zijn niet van rechtswege van toepassing op kinderen, wier ouders diplomatieke immuniteiten genieten in het land van geboorte. De wet van iederen Staat moet toestaan, dat ingeval kinderen van beroepsconsuls of van ambtenaren van vreemde Staten, die door hun Regeeringen belast zijn met officieele zendingen, twee nationaliteiten bezitten ingevolge hun geboorte, zij door verwerping of op andere wijze ontslagen kunnen worden van de nationaliteit van het land van geboorte, echter op voorwaarde, dat zij de nationaliteit van hun ouders behouden.  

### Artikel  13  

De naturalisatie van de ouders doet diegene van hun kinderen, die volgens de wet van den Staat, welke de naturalisatie verleent, minderjarig zijn, de nationaliteit van dien Staat verwerven. De wet van dien Staat kan de voorwaarden bepalen, waarvan in zoodanig geval het verwerven van de nationaliteit afhankelijk is. In de gevallen, waarin de wet van een Staat de gevolgen van de naturalisatie der ouders niet uitstrekt over hun minderjarige kinderen, behouden deze hun nationaliteit.  

### Artikel  14  

Een kind, welks beide ouders onbekend zijn, bezit de nationaliteit van het land van geboorte. Indien de afstamming van het kind wordt vastgesteld, zal zijn nationaliteit worden bepaald volgens de regelen, die van toepassing zijn in de gevallen, waarin de afstamming bekend is. Een vondeling wordt, totdat het bewijs van het tegendeel is geleverd, verondersteld te zijn geboren op het grondgebied van den Staat waar hij is gevonden.  

### Artikel  15  

Indien de nationaliteit van een Staat niet van rechtswege wordt verkregen ten gevolge van de geboorte op het grondgebied van dien Staat, kan een kind, dat aldaar geboren is uit ouders zonder nationaliteit of wier nationaliteit onbekend is, de nationaliteit van dien Staat verwerven. De wet van dezen Staat zal de voorwaarden bepalen, waarvan in zodanig geval het verkrijgen van zijn nationaliteit afhankelijk is.  

### Artikel  16  

Indien de wet van een Staat erkent, dat een natuurlijk kind, dat de nationaliteit van dien Staat bezit, deze kan verliezen ten gevolge van een wijziging in zijn burgerlijken staat (wettiging, erkenning), zal dit verlies desniettemin afhankelijk zijn van het verkrijgen van de nationaliteit van een anderen Staat overeenkomstig de wet dezen laatsten Staat betreffende de gevolgen van de wijziging in den burgerlijken staat ten aanzien van de nationaliteit.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####— Adoptie.

### Artikel  17  

Indien de wet van een Staat verlies van nationaliteit ten gevolge van adoptie erkent, zal dit verlies afhankelijk zijn van het verkrijgen door den geadopteerde van de nationaliteit van den persoon door wien hij wordt geadopteerd, overeenkomstig de wet van den Staat, waarvan deze laatste onderdaan is, betreffende de gevolgen van de adoptie ten aanzien van de nationaliteit.
