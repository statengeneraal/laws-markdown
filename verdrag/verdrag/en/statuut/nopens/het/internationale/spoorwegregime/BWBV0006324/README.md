####CONVENTION AND STATUTE ON THE INTERNATIONAL REGIME OF RAILWAYS.

Germany, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the British Empire (with New Zealand and India), Bulgaria, Chile, Denmark, the Free City of Danzig, Spain, Esthonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Salvador, Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Uruguay, Desirous of making provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and transit, and of promoting for that purpose international co-operation in the organisation and working of traffic; Being also desirous of ensuring the application of the principle of the equitable treatment of commerce to the international regime of railways; Considering that the best method of achieving their present purpose is by means of a general convention to which the greatest possible number of States can later accede; Recognising that international agreement in respect of railway transport has already been the subject of many special conventions between States and between railway administrations, and that it is precisely by means of such special conventions that international co-operation in this domain can make the most effective progress in the practical application of principles established by a general convention; Considering, however, that, so far from limiting the effect and scope of such special conventions or interfering with direct relations and negotiations between railway administrations, or in any way affecting the rights of sovereignty or authority of States, it is, on the contrary, by a concise and systematic codification of recognised international obligations in respect of international railway traffic that the principles already established between certain States or certain administrations can be given the widest possible extension, and that in the future the conclusion of new special conventions, to suit the requirements and developments of international traffic, can be facilitated in the greatest possible measure; And whereas the Conference which met at Barcelona on March 10th, 1921, on the invitation of the League of Nations, recommended that a General Convention on the International Regime of Railways should be concluded within a period of two years; and whereas the Conference which met at Genoa on April 10th, 1922, requested, in a resolution which was transmitted to the competent organisations of the League of Nations with the approval of the Council and the Assembly of the League, that the International Conventions relating to the Regime of Communications contemplated by the Treaties of Peace should be concluded and put into operation as soon as possible; and whereas Article 379 of the Treaty of Versailles and the corresponding Articles of the other Treaties provided for the preparation of a General Convention on the International Regime of Railways; Having accepted the invitation of the League of Nations to take part in the Conference which met at Geneva on November 15th, 1923; Anxious to bring into force the provisions of the Statute relating to the International Regime of Railways adopted thereat and to conclude a General Convention for this purpose; The High Contracting Parties have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: The President of the German Reich: Dr. SEELIGER, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Delegate at the Second General Conference on Communications and Transit, and M.

####STATUTE

### Part  I  

####Interchange of international Traffic by Rail.

### CHAPTER  I  

####Junction of International Lines.

### Article  1  

With a view to establishing such connections between their railway systems as are demanded by the requirements of international traffic, the Contracting States undertake: 

In cases where the said railway systems are already in contact, to provide for a through service connecting the existing lines wherever the needs of international traffic so require;  

In cases where the existing connections are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the said traffic, to communicate to each other without delay, and to examine together, in a friendly spirit, their schemes for the reinforcing of existing lines or the construction of new lines the junction of which with the railway systems of one or more Contracting States, or the extension of which on to the territory of one or more Contracting States, would meet such requirements.   The foregoing provisions do not involve any obligation affecting lines constructed in the interests of particular localities or of national defence.  

### Article  2  

In view of the general importance to users of railways, and in particular to passengers, of performance of the various exit and entry formalities at the same place, those States which do not feel themselves prevented from doing so by considerations of another nature shall endeavour to secure this object either by establishing common frontier stations, or at least common stations for traffic in each direction, or by any other suitable means. The State on whose territory the common frontier station is situated shall afford to the other State every facility for establishing and working the offices necessary for the services indispensable to international traffic.  

### Article  3  

The State on whose territory the junction lines or frontier stations are situated shall, without prejudice to its rights of sovereignty or authority, which shall remain intact, afford to the State officials or railway employees of the other State support and assistance in the exercise of their duties with a view to facilitating international traffic.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####Working Arrangements for International Traffic.

### Article  4  

Recognising the necessity of granting sufficient elasticity in the operation of railways to allow the complex needs of traffic to be met, it is the intention of the Contracting States to maintain unimpaired full freedom of operation while ensuring that such freedom is exercised without detriment to international traffic. They undertake to give reasonable facilities to international traffic and to refrain from all discrimination of an unfair nature directed against the other Contracting States, their nationals or their vessels. The benefit of the provisions of the present article is not confined to traffic governed by a single contract; it extends also to the traffic dealt with in Articles 21 and 22 of the present Statute subject to the conditions specified in the said articles.  

### Article  5  

As regards the facilities to be afforded to international passenger and baggage traffic, services shall be so organised that the time-tables shall be more favourable and the conditions of speed and comfort shall be better, in accordance with the greater importance of the traffic movements with which such services deal. The States shall encourage the establishment of through trains or, failing through trains, the running of through carriages on the main international traffic routes, and all other measures calculated to make travel on the said routes particularly speedy and comfortable.  

### Article  6  

As regards the facilities to be afforded to international goods traffic, services shall be organised in such a manner as to ensure conditions of speed and regularity in accordance with the importance of the traffic carried. The States shall encourage technical measures of all kinds calculated to ensure an exceptionally efficient service on the routes by which international traffic of exceptional importance passes.  

### Article  7  

In the event of international traffic being temporarily suspended or restricted on a given route, the administrations working lines on that route, in so far as it is within their province to take remedial measures, shall endeavour to re-establish a normal service as soon as possible, and, in the meantime, to send the traffic by another route, if necessary with the aid of the administrations of other States which may be in a position to give assistance over their systems.  

### Article  8  

The Contracting States shall so regulate their Customs and police formalities as to subject international traffic to the least possible hindrance and delay. The same obligation shall apply to passport formalities in so far as such are required. The Contracting States shall specially encourage measures calculated to restrict the formalities at frontier stations, and particularly agreements concerning the fastening of wagons and the sealing of baggage passing through under Customs control, and also arrangements allowing Customs formalities to be carried out in the interior of a country.  

### Part  II  

####Reciprocity in the Use of Rolling-stock; technical Uniformity.

### Article  9  

So far as circumstances reasonably permit, the Contracting States shall urge the railway administrations under their sovereignty or authority, whose lines form a continuous system of the same gauge, to enter into agreements with each other providing for all such measures as are calculated to allow or facilitate the exchange and reciprocal use of rolling-stock. Such agreements may also provide for giving assistance by the supply of empty wagons in cases where such assistance is necessary to meet the needs of international traffic. Measures which would entail modifications in the essential characteristics of a railway system or rolling-stock are not included among the measures to be dealt with in the above-mentioned agreements. Nevertheless, in cases where such modifications appear specially desirable owing to the intensity of the traffic and the comparatively small extent of the adaptation required, the Contracting States concerned agree to communicate to each other without delay any proposal as to such modifications and to examine such proposals together in a friendly spirit.  

### Article  10  

With a view to facilitating the reciprocal use of rolling-stock, the Contracting States shall facilitate the conclusion of agreements for technical uniformity of railways, particularly in respect of the construction and maintenance of rolling-stock, and the loading of wagons, in so far as such agreements may be advantageous for the proper carriage of international traffic. With a view to affording international traffic all the facilities and security desirable, such agreements may, particularly in the case of groups of contiguous countries, provide for the standardisation of conditions of construction and of railway equipment of a technical nature.  

### Article  11  

Special agreements may also provide for assistance by the supply of locomotives and, should the international traffic concerned justify it, by the supply of fuel or electric power.  

### Article  12  

Special agreements between States may provide that the rolling-stock of any administration, including locomotives and all movable property forming part of and contained in such rolling-stock, shall be immune from seizure on the territory of a State other than that to which the owning administration belongs, except in virtue of a judgment of the courts of the latter State.  

### Article  13  

The use and the circulation in international traffic of wagons of private persons, or organisations other than railway administrations, shall be dealt with by special agreements.  

### Part  III  

####Relations between the Railway and its Users.

### Article  14  

In the interests of international traffic, the Contracting States shall, so far as circumstances reasonably permit, facilitate the conclusion of agreements permitting the use of a single contract to cover an entire journey; in such agreements an effort will be made to attain the greatest possible measure of uniformity in the conditions governing the execution of the through contract by each of the various administrations taking part in the carrying of the traffic.  

### Article  15  

Failing a single transport contract, reasonable facilities shall be afforded for the carriage on successive contracts of traffic passing over the railways of two or more Contracting States.  

### Article  16  

The principal matters to be dealt with by the special agreements relating to the single transport contract for passengers and baggage are the following: 

(a) The conditions under which the railway is obliged to accept, or is at liberty to reject, the transport contract;  

(b) The conditions governing the conclusion of the transport contract and the drawing up of the document containing the terms of the contract;  

(c) The obligations and regulations with which the passenger is obliged to comply;  

(d) The passenger's obligations as regards the compliance with other formalities (such as Customs formalities) connected with the journey and necessary for its completion;  

(e) The conditions of delivery of baggage;  

(f) The provisions applicable in the case of interruption of service or other hindrances to the completion of the journey;  

(g) The responsibility assumed by the railways under the transport contract;  

(h) Rights of action arising out of the transport contract and the enforcement of judgments.    

### Article  17  

The principal matters to be dealt with by the special agreements relating to the single transport contract for goods are the following: 

(a) The conditions under which the railway is obliged to accept, or is at liberty to reject, the transport contract;  

(b) The conditions governing the conclusion of the transport contract and the drawing up of the document containing the terms of the contract;  

(c) Definition of the obligations and responsibilities of the various parties concerned in the contract concluded with the railway;  

(d) Provisions relating to the route to be followed and to the time-limit, if any, within which the transport should be completed;  

(e) The conditions regulating compliance during the journey with other formalities (such as Customs formalities) connected with and necessary for the carriage of the goods;  

(f) The conditions governing the delivery of the goods, and the conditions of payment of the railway charges;  

(g) The guarantees given to the railway for the payment of its charges;  

(h) The measures to be taken in case of obstacles preventing carriage or delivery;  

(i) The responsibility assumed by the railway under the transport contract;  

(j) Rights of action arising out of the transport contract and the enforcement of judgments.    

### Part  IV  

####Tariffs.

### Article  18  

The tariffs in force in accordance with national laws and duly published before coming into force shall fix: 

In respect of passengers and baggage, the rates for carriage, including incidental charges, if any, and the conditions under which they shall be applied;  

In respect of goods, the rates for carriage, including incidental charges, the classification of goods to which these rates are applicable and the conditions to which such application shall be subject.   The railways shall be obliged to grant to any traffic the tariff applicable to it, provided that the traffic fulfils the conditions of the tariff.  

### Article  19  

As regards international traffic, the railways may not levy, over and above the charges fixed in the tariffs applicable to any particular traffic, any charges other than those which constitute an equitable remuneration for services which are not covered by the charges fixed in the tariffs.  

### Article  20  

The Contracting States, recognising the necessity in general of leaving tariffs sufficient flexibility to permit of their being adapted as closely as possible to the complex needs of trade and commercial competition, retain full freedom to frame their tariffs in accordance with the principles accepted by their own legislation, provided that this freedom is exercised without detriment to international traffic. They undertake to apply to international traffic tariffs which are reasonable both as regards their amounts and the conditions of their application, and undertake to refrain from all discrimination of an unfair nature directed against the other Contracting States, their nationals or their vessels. These provisions shall not prevent the establishment of combined rail and sea tariffs which comply with the principles laid down in the previous paragraphs.  

### Article  21  

The benefit of the provisions of Article 20 shall not be confined to transport based on single contracts. It shall extend equally to transport made up of successive stages by rail, by sea or by any other mode of transport traversing the territory of more than one Contracting State and regulated by separate contracts, subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions: 

Each of the successive contracts must specify the initial source and final destination of the consignment; during the whole duration of carriage the goods must remain under the supervision of the carriers and must be forwarded by each carrier to his successor direct and without delay other than that necessary for the completion of the transport operations and the Customs, octroi, police or other administrative formalities.    

### Article  22  

The provisions of Article 20 shall be equally applicable to internal, as well as to international, traffic by rail as regards goods which remain temporarily at the port without regard to the flag under which they have been imported or will be exported.  

### Article  23  

The Contracting States shall endeavour to promote the establishment of international tariffs to meet all the needs of international traffic which they can reasonably satisfy. They shall also facilitate the adoption of all measures tending, even apart from international tariffs, to make possible the ready calculation of the transport charges as regards the more important movements of traffic.  

### Article  24  

The Contracting States shall endeavour to obtain uniformity in the mode of presentation of both international and national tariffs, particularly in respect of groups of contiguous territories, with a view to facilitating the application of such tariffs in respect of international traffic.  

### Part  V  

####Financial Arrangements between Railway Administrations in the interest of international Traffic.

### Article  25  

The financial arrangements between railway administrations shall be such as not to hamper the working of international traffic and particularly the application of single transport contracts.  

### Article  26  

As regards railway receipts, the matters to be dealt with by these arrangements are, more particularly, the following: 

(a) Regulations respecting the right of each administration to receive its share of the sums due to the railways;  

(b) Regulations respecting the responsibility of an administration which fails to collect a sum for the collection of which it is responsible;  

(c) Arrangements to be made to ensure the accuracy of accounts where administrations entrust such accountancy work to other administrations;  

(d) Arrangements for reducing, so far as circumstances permit, the actual transfer of funds necessitated by financial settlements between administrations.    

### Article  27  

As regards sums which a railway has paid to its users, the matters to be dealt with in arrangements between railway administrations are, more particularly, the following: 

(a) Regulations regarding the right of recourse of an administration which has paid compensation against other administrations taking part in the carriage;  

(b) Provisions determining the responsibilities of the different administrations or the responsibilities which they agree to share;  

(c) Provisions dealing with the recourse of administrations against each other in the case of one of them deciding to refund a sum levied in excess of the amount due to the railway (overcharge);  

(d) Rules as to the recognition by the administrations of a judgment which has been given against one of them obliging it to make a payment.    

### Article  28  

Where, as the result of the state of the exchanges, difficulties arise constituting a serious hindrance to international traffic, measures shall be taken to reduce such inconveniences to a minimum. Any railway administration which is subject to the risk of appreciable loss on currency exchange in the settlement of accounts may protect itself by adding to its through transport charges such a premium as may be reasonably sufficient to cover such risk. The arrangements between the railway administrations may provide for fixed rates of exchange subject to periodical revision. Measures shall be taken to prevent as far as possible any improper speculations being made by intermediaries in the course of the transactions necessitated by the state of the exchanges.  

### Part  VI  

####General Regulations.

### Article  29  

Measures of a general or particular character which a Contracting State is obliged to take in case of an emergency affecting the safety of the State or the vital interests of the country may, in exceptional cases, and for as short a period as possible, involve a deviation from the provisions of the above articles, it being understood that the principles of the present Statute must be observed to the utmost possible extent.  

### Article  30  

No Contracting State shall be bound by this Statute to ensure the transit of passengers whose admission into its territories is forbidden, or of goods of a kind of which the importation is prohibited, either on grounds of public health or security or as a precaution against diseases of animals or plants. As regards traffic other than traffic in transit, no Contracting State shall be bound by this Statute to ensure the transport of passengers whose admission to its territory is prohibited, or of goods of which the import or export is prohibited by its national laws. Each Contracting State shall be entitled to take the necessary precautionary measures in respect of the transport of dangerous goods or goods of a similar character, it being understood that such measures must not result in any discrimination contrary to the principles of the present Statute, and also to enforce general police measures, including police measures in connection with emigration traffic. Nothing in this Statute shall affect the measures which one of the Contracting States is or may feel called upon to take in pursuance of general international conventions to which it is a party, or which may be concluded hereafter, particularly conventions concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations, relating to the transit, export or import of particular kinds of articles such as opium or other dangerous drugs, arms, or the produce of fisheries, or in pursuance of general conventions intended to prevent any infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property, or relating to false marks, false indications of origin or other methods of unfair competition.  

### Article  31  

The provisions of this Statute do not of themselves impose on any Contracting States any new obligation to facilitate transport of nationals of a non-contracting State, or their baggage, or of goods, carriages, or wagons coming from or destined to a non-contracting State.  

### Article  32  

This Statute does not prescribe the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The Statute shall, however, continue in force in time of war so far as such rights and duties permit.  

### Article  33  

This Statute does not entail in any way the withdrawal of facilities which are greater than those provided for in the Statute and which have been granted to international traffic by rail under conditions consistent with its principles. This Statute also entails no prohibition of such grant of greater facilities in the future.  

### Article  34  

In conformity with Article 23 (*e*) of the Covenant of the League of Nations, any Contracting State which can establish a good case against the application of any provisions of this Statute, in part or all of its territory, on the ground of the grave economic situation arising out of the acts of devastation perpetrated on its soil during the war 1914-1918, shall be deemed to be relieved temporarily of the obligations arising from the application of such provision, it being understood that the principles of this Statute must be observed to the utmost possible extent.  

### Article  35  

Should a dispute arise between two or more Contracting States as to the interpretation or the application of the present Statute, and should it prove impossible to settle such dispute either directly between the Parties or by any other method of amicable settlement, the Parties to the dispute may, before resorting to any procedure of arbitration or to a judicial settlement, submit the dispute for an advisory opinion to the body established by the League of Nations as the advisory and technical organisation of Members of the League for matters of communications and transit. In urgent cases, a preliminary opinion may be given recommending temporary measures, including measures to restore the facilities for international traffic which existed before the act or occurrence which gave rise to the dispute. Should it prove impossible to settle the dispute by any of the methods of procedure enumerated in the preceding paragraph, the Contracting States shall submit their dispute to arbitration unless they have decided, or shall decide, under an agreement between them, to bring it before the Permanent Court of International Justice.  

### Article  36  

If the case is submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice, it shall be heard and determined under the conditions laid down in Article 27 of the Statute of the Court. If arbitration is resorted to, and unless the Parties decide otherwise, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator, and a third member of the arbitral tribunal shall be elected by the arbitrators, or, in case the latter are unable to agree, shall be selected by the Council of the League of Nations from the list of assessors for communications and transit cases mentioned in Article 27 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice; in such latter case the third arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the provisions of the penultimate paragraph of Article 4 and the first paragraph of Article 6 of the Covenant of the League. The arbitral tribunal shall judge the case on the basis of the terms of reference mutually agreed upon between the Parties. If the Parties have failed to reach an agreement, the arbitral tribunal acting unanimously shall itself draw up terms of reference after considering the claims formulated by the Parties; if unanimity cannot be obtained, the Council of the League of Nations shall decide the terms of reference under the conditions laid down in the preceding paragraph. If the procedure is not determined by the terms of reference, it shall be settled by the arbitral tribunal. During the course of the arbitration the Parties, in the absence of any contrary provision in the terms of reference, are bound to submit to the Permanent Court of International Justice any question of international law or question as to the legal meaning of this Statute the solution of which the arbitral tribunal, at the request of one of the Parties, pronounces to be a necessary preliminary to the settlement of the dispute.  

### Article  37  

The Contracting States shall facilitate the conclusion of special agreements for the purpose of putting the provisions of the present Statute into force in cases where existing agreements are not adequate for this purpose.  

### Article  38  

The provisions of this present Statute may be extended by special conventions to transport undertakings operating means of transport other than railways, particularly where such undertakings are ancillary to railway transport. Such undertakings shall thereupon be subject to all the obligations imposed and shall be entitled to all the rights conferred upon railways by the present Statute. Nevertheless, the special conventions referred to in paragraph 1 may allow of any exceptions to the present Statute which may be necessary owing to the difference in the methods of transport. In particular, in the case of contracts relating to international traffic carried partly by rail and partly by sea, such exceptions may provide for the application of maritime law to the sea journey.  

### Article  39  

Should special conventions as provided for in Article 38 not be applicable, reasonable facilities shall be afforded for the movement of traffic by rail and a different means of transport, such as transport by sea.  

### Article  40  

The Contracting States undertake to introduce into those existing conventions which contravene the provisions of this Statute, so soon as circumstances permit and in any case on the expiry of such conventions, the modifications required to bring them into harmony with such provisions, so far as the geographical, economic or technical circumstances of the countries or areas concerned allow.  

### Article  41  

Without prejudice to the application of Article 24 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, all offices or bureaux which have been, or may be, set up by international conventions to facilitate the settlement between States of questions concerning transport by rail shall be regarded as animated by the same spirit as the organisations of the League of Nations, and – for the purposes of the execution of the present Statute – as extending, within their particular sphere, the action of these organisations; they will therefore exchange with the competent organisations of the League all relevant information concerning the fulfilment of their function of international co-operation.  

### Article  42  

The Contracting States shall take all necessary steps to communicate to the League of Nations all information likely to assist the organisations of the League in carrying out the tasks which fall to them with a view to the application of the present Convention.  

### Article  43  

It is understood that this Statute must not be interpreted as regulating in any way rights and obligations *inter se* of territories forming part of or placed under the protection of the same sovereign State, whether or not these territories are individually Contracting States.  

### Article  44  

Nothing in the preceding Articles is to be construed as affecting in any way the rights or duties of a Contracting State as Member of the League of Nations.  

####PROTOCOL OF SIGNATURE TO THE CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL REGIME OF RAILWAYS.

At the moment of signing the Convention of to-day's date relating to the International Regime of Railways, the undersigned, duly authorised, have agreed as follows: 

1. It is understood that any differential treatment of flags based solely on the consideration of the flag should be considered as discrimination of an unfair nature in the sense of Articles 4 and 20 of the Statute on the International Regime of Railways.  

2. In the event of the flag or nationality of a Contracting State being identical with the flag or nationality of a State or territory which is outside the Convention, no claim can be advanced on behalf of the latter State or territory to participate in the benefits assured by this Statute to the flag or nationals of Contracting States.   The present Protocol will have the same force, effect and duration as the Statute of to-day's date, of which it is to be considered as an integral part.   
Done at Geneva, the ninth day of December one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three.

####STATUUT.

### Deel  I  

####Internationaal Spoorwegverkeer.

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Aansluiting van internationale lijnen.

### Artikel  1  

Teneinde tusschen hun spoorwegnetten de verbindingen tot stand te brengen, die beantwoorden aan de behoeften van het internationale verkeer, komen de Verdragstaten overeen: 

In gevallen waarin de bedoelde spoorwegnetten reeds met elkander in verbinding staan, een doorgaand verkeer over de bestaande lijnen in het leven te roepen voor zoover de behoeften van het internationale verkeer het vereischen;  

In gevallen waarin de bestaande verbindingen niet voldoende zijn om te beantwoorden aan de behoeften van het verkeer, elkander onverwijld mededeling te doen van en te zamen in vriendschappelijken geest een onderzoek in te stellen naar hun plannen inzake versterking van bestaande lijnen of inzake aanleg van nieuwe lijnen, welker aansluiting op de spoorwegnetten van een of meer Verdragstaten, of welker verlenging op het grondgebied van een of meer Verdragstaten aan deze behoeften zou beantwoorden.   De voorafgaande bepalingen brengen geenerlei verplichting mede met betrekking tot lijnen, die aangelegd zijn in het belang van een bepaalde streek of van de nationale verdediging.  

### Artikel  2  

Met het oog op het belang dat in het algemeen zij die van een spoorweg gebruik maken, en in het bijzonder de reizigers, erbij hebben, dat de verschillende formaliteiten van het verlaten van het ééne en het binnenkomen van het andere land in eenzelfde plaats geschieden, zullen de Staten, die van oordeel zijn, dat niet overwegingen van anderen aard zich hiertegen verzetten, er naar streven dit denkbeeld te verwezenlijken, hetzij door het instellen van gemeenschappelijke grensstations of althans van gemeenschappelijke stations voor iedere richting, of door eenig ander geschikt middel. De Staat, op wiens grondgebied het gemeenschappelijke grensstation gelegen is, zal aan den anderen Staat alle faciliteiten verleenen voor het oprichten en instandhouden van de bureau's die noodig zijn voor de voor het internationale verkeer onmisbare diensten.  

### Artikel  3  

De Staat op wiens grondgebied de verbindingslijnen of de grensstations gelegen zijn, zal, zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op zijn souvereiniteits- of gezagsrechten die onaangetast blijven, hulp en bijstand verleenen aan de Staats- of spoorwegambtenaren van den anderen Staat in de uitoefening van hun functie, teneinde het internationale verkeer te bevorderen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Maatregelen te nemen in het belang van het internationale verkeer.

### Artikel  4  

De Verdragstaten, de noodzakelijkheid erkennende om de exploitatie van de spoorwegen te doen geschieden met de soepelheid, noodig om te voldoen aan de veelzijdige behoeften van het verkeer, geven als hun voornemen te kennen de vrijheid van deze exploitatie onaangetast te laten, met dien verstande dat er voor gewaakt zal worden dat deze vrijheid wordt uitgeoefend zonder schade voor het internationale verkeer. Zij verbinden zich aan het internationale verkeer redelijke faciliteiten te verleenen en zich te onthouden van iedere onderscheiding, die een onwelwillend karakter zou dragen ten opzichte van andere Verdragstaten, hun onderdanen of hun schepen. De bepalingen van dit artikel komen niet alleen ten goede aan doorvoer beheerscht door een enkelvoudig contract, zij hebben eveneens betrekking op doorvoeren als bedoeld in artt. 21 en 22 van dit Statuut, op de voorwaarden als aangegeven in deze artikelen.  

### Artikel  5  

Wat betreft de aan het internationale verkeer van reizigers en bagage te verleenen faciliteiten, zullen de diensten zoodanig zijn ingericht, dat de dienstregelingen gunstiger zullen zijn en aan hoogere eischen betreffende snelheid en gemak zullen voldoen naarmate de diensten een meer belangrijk verkeer verzorgen.  

### Artikel  6  

Wat betreft de aan het internationale goederenverkeer te verleenen faciliteiten, zullen de diensten zoodanig zijn ingericht, dat de snelheid en regelmatigheid grooter is naarmate de diensten een belangrijker verkeer verzorgen. De Staten zullen technische maatregelen van welken aard ook aanmoedigen, die kunnen strekken om op de lijnen, waarlangs een bij uitstek belangrijk internationaal verkeer plaats heeft, ook een bij uitstek doelmatiger dienst te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  7  

Ingeval het internationale verkeer op een bepaalde route tijdelijk gestaakt of beperkt is, zullen de exploiteerende administraties, voor zoover het in haar macht ligt hier in verbetering te brengen, ernaar streven om zoo spoedig mogelijk een normalen dienst te herstellen en inmiddels het verkeer langs een andere route te leiden met de medewerking, voor zoover noodig, van de administraties van andere Staten, die met haar lijnen bijstand zouden kunnen verleenen.  

### Artikel  8  

De Verdragstaten zullen de douane- en politieformaliteiten zoodanig regelen, dat het internationale verkeer zoo weinig mogelijk wordt belemmerd en vertraagd. Dezelfde verplichting geldt ten aanzien van formaliteiten ter zake van paspoorten, voor zoover deze worden gevorderd. De Verdragstaten zullen in het bijzonder de maatregelen aanmoedigen, strekkende om de in de grensstations te verrichten formaliteiten te beperken, en met name bevorderen, dat overeenkomsten worden gesloten inzake de sluiting van wagens; en de verzegeling van bagage in douaneverkeer, evenals alle regelingen die het mogelijk maken het vervullen van de douaneformaliteiten binnen in het land te doen geschieden.  

### Deel  II  

####Wederzijdsch gebruik van rollend materieel en technische eenheid.

### Artikel  9  

De Verdragstaten zullen, voor zoover de omstandigheden redelijkerwijze toelaten, de spoorwegadministraties, die onder hun souvereiniteit of hun gezag zijn geplaatst en waarvan de lijnen een doorloopend net van wegen van dezelfde spoorwijdte vormen, opwekken onderling overeenkomsten te sluiten, strekkende tot al zoodanige maatregelen, geschikt om de uitwisseling en het wederzijdsche gebruik van rollend materieel mogelijk te maken en te vergemakkelijken. Deze overeenkomsten zullen eveneens kunnen strekken tot het verleenen van bijstand door het leveren van leege wagens, ingeval deze bijstand noodzakelijk is om te voldoen aan de behoeften van het internationale verkeer. Onder maatregelen als bedoeld in de bovenvermelde overeenkomsten zijn niet begrepen die maatregelen, die wijzigingen zonden medebrengen in de essentieele eigenaardigheden van een spoorwegnet of van het rollend materieel. In de gevallen echter, waarin zoodanige wijzigingen bijzonder wenschelijk zonden schijnen met het oog op den omvang van het verkeer en de geringe moeite die de aanpassing zou medebrengen, komen de betrokken Verdragstaten overeen elkander onverwijld alle voorstellen mede te deelen, die zoodanige wijzigingen ten doel hebben en deze voorstellen op welwillende wijze te onderzoeken.  

### Artikel  10  

Teneinde het wederzijdsch gebruik van rollend materieel te vergemakkelijken, zullen de Verdragstaten het tot stand komen van overeenkomsten, die de technische eenheid van de spoorwegen beoogen, bevorderen, met name nopens den bouw en het onderhoud van het rollend materieel, evenals de belasting van de wagens, in zooverre als dit bevorderlijk kan zijn voor de goede uitvoering van het internationale verkeer. Teneinde aan het internationale verkeer alle wenschelijke faciliteiten en veiligheid te verzekeren, zullen deze overeenkomsten, met name voor zoover betreft de groepen van aangrenzende gebieden, streven naar het brengen van eenheid in de voorwaarden van den bouw en de technische inrichting van de spoorwegen.  

### Artikel  11  

Bijzondere overeenkomsten zullen kunnen voorzien in het verleenen van bijstand met locomotieven en ingeval het desbetreffende internationale verkeer dit zou vereischen, van brandstoffen of van electrische energie.  

### Artikel  12  

Bijzondere overeenkomsten tusschen de Staten zullen kunnen vaststellen, dat het rollend materieel van een administratie, met inbegrip van de locomotieven, evenals van alle roerende goederen, die aan deze administratie toebehooren en in dit materieel zijn begrepen, op het grondgebied van een anderen Staat dan van dien waaronder de spoorwegadministratie die de eigenaar is ressorteert, niet zullen kunnen worden in beslag genomen dan krachtens een vonnis gewezen door de rechterlijke autoriteit van dien laatsten Staat.  

### Artikel  13  

Het gebruik en de circulatie in het internationale verkeer van wagens van particulieren of van andere lichamen dan spoorwegadministraties zullen het onderwerp uitmaken van bijzondere overeenkomsten.  

### Deel  III  

####Verhouding tusschen den spoorweg en de personen die er gebruik van maken.

### Artikel  14  

In het belang van het internationale verkeer zullen de Verdragstaten, voor zoover de omstandigheden redelijkerwijze toelaten, bevorderen, dat overeenkomsten tot stand komen, die het gebruik van een enkelvoudig contract voor het geheele vervoer mogelijk maken; bij deze overeenkomst zal men trachten een zoo groot mogelijke eenvormigheid te verkrijgen ten aanzien van de voorwaarden, betrekking hebbende op de uitvoering van het directe contract door ieder van de spoorwegmaatschappijen, die bij het vervoer betrokken zijn.  

### Artikel  15  

Bij gebreke van vaststelling van een enkelvoudig vervoercontract zullen redelijke faciliteiten worden gegeven voor de uitvoering, op den grondslag van opvolgende contracten, van het vervoer, dat zich over de spoorwegen van twee of meer Verdragstaten uitstrekt.  

### Artikel  16  

De voornaamste bepalingen, die in de bijzondere overeenkomsten inzake het enkelvoudig vervoercontract voor reizigers en bagage moeten worden overwogen, zijn de volgende: 

a) de voorwaarden volgens welke de spoorweg al dan niet verplicht is het vervoercontract te aanvaarden;  

b) de voorwaarden voor het sluiten van het vervoercontract en van het opmaken van het document, dat de voorwaarden van het contract bevat;  

c) de verplichtingen en regelingen, waarnaar de reizigers verplicht zijn zich te gedragen;  

d) de verplichting van den reiziger met betrekking tot het vervullen van de bijbehoorende formaliteiten – zooals de douaneformaliteiten – die noodig zijn voor de uitvoering van het vervoer;  

e) de voorwaarden voor de aflevering van de bagage;  

f) de bepalingen, die voorzien zijn ingeval van onderbreking van den dienst of andere moeilijkheden bij de uitvoering van het vervoer;  

g) de verantwoordelijkheid van den spoorweg voortvloeiende uit het vervoercontract;  

h) de uitoefening van aanspraken voortvloeiende uit het vervoercontract en de uitvoering der vonnissen.    

### Artikel  17  

De voornaamste bepalingen, die in de bijzondere overeenkomsten betreffende het enkelvoudig vervoercontract voor goederen moeten worden overwogen, zijn de volgende: 

a) de voorwaarden volgens welke de spoorweg al dan niet verplicht is het vervoercontract te aanvaarden;  

b) de voorwaarden voor het sluiten van het vervoercontract en van het opmaken van het document dat de voorwaarden van het contract bevat;  

c) de omschrijving van de verplichtingen en verantwoordelijkheden van de verschillende partijen, betrokken bij het contract, dat aangegaan is met den spoorweg;  

d) de bepalingen betrekking hebbende op de bij het contract te volgen route en eventueel op de termijnen, waarbinnen het vervoer moet plaats hebben;  

e) de voorwaarden inzake het vervullen onderweg van de bijbehoorende formaliteiten –zooals de douaneformaliteiten – die noodig zijn bij de uitvoering van het vervoer;  

f) de voorwaarden van aflevering van de goederen en van de betaling van de aan de spoorwegen verschuldigde gelden;  

g) de waarborgen, die aan den spoorweg worden verleend, voor de betaling van de verschuldigde gelden;  

h) de maatregelen, die genomen moeten worden ingeval van belemmering in het vervoer of in de aflevering;  

i) de verantwoordelijkheid van den spoorweg voortvloeiende uit het vervoercontract;  

j) de uitoefening van aanspraken, voortvloeiende uit het vervoercontract en de uitvoering der vonnissen.    

### Deel  IV  

####Tarieven.

### Artikel  18  

De tarieven, die overeenkomstig de nationale wetgeving van kracht zijn en voor hun inwerkingtreding behoorlijk worden bekend gemaakt, zullen bepalen: 

Ten aanzien van reizigers en bagage, de vervoerprijzen met inbegrip voor zoover daarvan sprake is van bijkomstige kosten, en de voorwaarden, waaronder zij worden toegepast;  

Ten aanzien van goederen, de vervoerprijzen met inbegrip van bijkomstige kosten, de classificatie van goederen, waarop deze prijzen van toepassing zijn, en de voorwaarden, waarvan de toepassing afhankelijk is.   De spoorweg kan ten aanzien van geen enkel vervoer het daarop toepasselijke tarief weigeren, indien de voorwaarden van het bedoelde tarief vervuld zijn.  

### Artikel  19  

In het internationale verkeer kunnen boven de tariefprijzen, die van toepassing zijn op een bepaald vervoer, geen andere bedragen worden gevorderd, dan die, welke een redelijke vergoeding vormen voor de diensten, die verleend worden buiten degene, welke gedekt zijn door de tarieven.  

### Artikel  20  

De Verdragstaten, de noodzakelijkheid erkennende om in het algemeen aan de tarieven de noodige soepelheid te laten, waardoor zij zoo nauwkeurig mogelijk zich kunnen aanpassen aan de veelzijdige behoeften van den handel en de handelsconcurrentie, behouden volle vrijheid om hun tarieven te bepalen volgens de beginselen nedergelegd in hun eigen wetgeving, met dien verstande echter, dat zij er voor waken, dat deze vrijheid niet uitgeoefend wordt ten nadeele van het internationale verkeer. Zij verbinden zich op het internationale verkeer redelijke tarieven toe te passen, zoowel wat betreft de hoogte van de tarieven als de voorwaarden van toepassing, en komen overeen zich te onthouden van iedere onderscheiding, die een onwelwillend karakter zou dragen ten aanzien van andere Verdragstaten, hun onderdanen of hun schepen. Deze bepalingen zijn niet onvereenigbaar met het instellen van gemeenschappelijke spoorweg- en scheepvaarttarieven, mits de beginselen nedergelegd in het voorafgaande lid worden geëerbiedigd.  

### Artikel  21  

Het voordeel van de bepalingen van art. 20 wordt niet beperkt tot vervoer, dat beheerscht wordt door een enkelvoudig contract. Het strekt zich eveneens uit tot het vervoer over een reeks trajecten per spoor, over zee of langs eenigen anderen weg, over de gebieden van meerdere Verdragstaten en beheerscht door afzonderlijke contracten, mits de volgende voorwaarden worden vervuld: 

Ieder van de opvolgende contracten moet de oorspronkelijke herkomst en de eindbestemming van het vervoer vermelden; de goederen moeten gedurende den duur van het geheele traject onder het toezicht blijven van de transporteurs en door ieder van hen aan den volgende rechtstreeks worden overgegeven, zonder eenig ander oponthoud dan dat hetwelk noodig is voor het bewerkstelligen van de overgave en het vervullen van de administratieve douane-, octrooi-, politie- of andere formaliteiten.    

### Artikel  22  

De bepalingen van art. 20 zijn, zoowel in het nationale als in het internationale spoorwegverkeer, eveneens van toepassing op goederen, die tijdelijk in een haven worden opgeslagen, zonder dat rekening wordt gehouden met de vlag, waaronder deze goederen zijn ingevoerd of zullen worden uitgevoerd.  

### Artikel  23  

De Verdragstaten zullen trachten het vaststellen van internationale tarieven te bevorderen overeenkomstig de behoeften van het internationale verkeer, voor zoover daaraan redelijkerwijze kan worden voldaan. Zij zullen eveneens bevorderen, dat alle maatregelen worden genomen, die kunnen strekken om zelfs buiten de internationale tarieven, de snelle berekening van de vervoerkosten voor het belangrijkste verkeer mogelijk te maken.  

### Artikel  24  

De Verdragstaten zullen trachten eenheid te verkrijgen in de wijze, waarop zoowel de internationale als de nationale tarieven worden overgelegd, met name voor zoover betreft groepen van aangrenzende gebieden, teneinde de toepassing van deze tarieven voor het internationale verkeer gemakkelijker te maken.  

### Deel  V  

####Financieele regelingen tusschen spoorwegadministraties in het belang van het internationale verkeer.

### Artikel  25  

De financieele regelingen tusschen spoorwegadministraties zullen niet van zoodanigen aard mogen zijn dat zij een belemmering vormen voor het internationale verkeer en in het bijzonder voor de toepassing van het enkelvoudige vervoercontract.  

### Artikel  26  

Met betrekking tot de ontvangsten der spoorwegen moeten, in het bijzonder de volgende bepalingen in zoodanige regelingen worden overwogen: 

a. regelen betreffende het recht van iedere administratie om het aandeel te ontvangen, dat haar toekomt uit de gelden, die aan den spoorweg verschuldigd zijn;  

b. regelen betreffende de verantwoordelijkheid van een administratie, die nagelaten heeft gelden te innen, voor de inning waarvan zij verantwoordelijk was;  

c. maatregelen te nemen om de juistheid van de boekhouding te verzekeren ingeval de administraties de vaststelling van deze boekhouding aan andere administraties toevertrouwen;  

d. bepalingen betreffende financieele regelingen tusschen administraties, die tot doel hebben om, voor zoover de omstandigheden dit toelaten, de daadwerkelijke overdracht van fondsen, die ingevolge deze regelingen noodig is, te beperken.    

### Artikel  27  

Met betrekking tot de bedragen, die een spoorweg betaald heeft aan de personen, die van den spoorweg gebruik maken, moeten in het bijzonder de volgende bepalingen in de regelingen tusschen de spoorwegmaatschappijen worden overwogen: 

a. regelen betreffende het beroep van de administratie, die een schadeloosstelling heeft betaald, op andere administraties, welke een aandeel hebben gehad in het vervoer;  

b. bepalingen betreffende het vaststellen van de verantwoordelijkheid van de verschillende administraties of van de verantwoordelijkheid, welke zij bereid zijn gemeenschappelijk te dragen;  

c. bepalingen betreffende het beroep van administraties op elkander, wanneer één van haar een bedrag, dat te veel is ontvangen op de som, die aan den spoorweg verschuldigd is, heeft terugbetaald;  

d. regelen betreffende het aanvaarden door administraties van gerechterlijke beslissingen, gewezen tegen een andere administratie, waarbij deze laatste veroordeeld is een bedrag te betalen.    

### Artikel  28  

Ingeval moeilijkheden voortvloeien uit den wisselkoers en wanneer deze een ernstige belemmering vormen voor het internationale verkeer, zullen maatregelen worden genomen om deze belemmeringen tot een minimum te beperken. Iedere spoorwegadministratie, die aan het gevaar is blootgesteld om bij het vaststellen van de afrekening aanmerkelijke verliezen te lijden op grond van koersschommelingen, zal zich tegen dit gevaar kunnen dekken door hare tarieven voor doorgaand verkeer met een zoodanige premie te verhoogen, als met het oog op dit risico redelijk kan worden geacht. De regelingen, die gesloten worden tusschen spoorwegadministraties, zullen vaste koersen kunnen instellen onder voorbehoud van periodieke herzieningen. Maatregelen zullen worden genomen om zooveel mogelijk tegen te gaan alle speculatie-misbruiken van tusschenpersonen bij de transacties, welke de stand der koersen noodzakelijk maakt.  

### Deel  VI  

####Algemeene bepalingen.

### Artikel  29  

Bij uitzondering en voor een zooveel mogelijk beperkten termijn zal kunnen afgeweken worden van de bepalingen van dit Statuut door bijzondere of algemeene maatregelen, die een der Verdragstaten genoodzaakt zou zijn te nemen ingeval van ernstige gebeurtenissen, die de veiligheid van den Staat of de levensbelangen van het land raken, met dien verstande dat de beginselen van dit Statuut in zoo groot mogelijke mate moeten worden in acht genomen.  

### Artikel  30  

Geen der Verdragstaten is door dit Statuut gehouden den doorvoer te verzekeren van reizigers, wier toelating op zijn grondgebied verboden is of van goederen, waarvan de invoer is verboden hetzij om redenen van openbare gezondheid of veiligheid, hetzij als voorzorg tegen ziekten van dieren of planten. Voor zoover betreft het vervoer dat geen doorvoer is, is geen der Verdragstaten door dit Statuut gehouden om het vervoer te verzekeren van reizigers, wier toelating op zijn grondgebied verboden is of van goederen waarvan de invoer of uitvoer verboden is krachtens de nationale wetten. Iedere Verdragstaat zal het recht hebben, eenerzijds om de noodige voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen met betrekking tot het vervoer van gevaarlijke of daarmede gelijk te stellen goederen, met dien verstande, dat zoodanige maatregelen niet tot uitwerking mogen hebben, dat onderscheidingen worden gemaakt in strijd met de beginselen van dit Statuut, en anderzijds om algemeene politiemaatregelen te nemen met inbegrip van politiemaatregelen ten aanzien van emigranten. Niets in dit Statuut zal een beletsel zijn voor de maatregelen, die een der Verdragstaten heeft genomen of zal wenschen te nemen krachtens algemeene internationale verdragen, waarbij hij partij is, of die later gesloten mochten worden, met name die, welke onder de auspiciën van den Volkenbond zijn gesloten met betrekking tot den doorvoer, den uitvoer of den invoer van een bijzondere soort van goederen, zooals opium of andere schadelijke middelen, wapenen of de voortbrengselen van de visscherij, of wel krachtens algemeene verdragen ten doel hebbende iedere inbreuk te voorkomen, op de rechten van industrieelen, letterkundigen of artistieken eigendom of betrekking hebbende op valsche merken, valsche aanwijzingen van oorsprong of andere wijzen van oneerlijken handel.  

### Artikel  31  

Dit Statuut legt aan geen der Verdragstaten, krachtens de hierin voorkomende bepalingen, een nieuwe verplichting op om het vervoer te vergemakkelijken van onderdanen van een Staat, die geen partij is bij het verdrag, of van hun bagage, en evenmin van goederen, rijtuigen of wagens afkomstig van of bestemd voor een Staat, die geen partij is bij het verdrag.  

### Artikel  32  

Dit Statuut stelt niet de rechten en verplichtingen der oorlogvoerenden en der onzijdigen in tijd van oorlog vast. Niettemin zal het Statuut in oorlogstijd van kracht blijven in de mate die met die rechten en verplichtingen vereenigbaar is.  

### Artikel  33  

Dit Statuut brengt geenszins mede de intrekking van faciliteiten, grooter dan die welke voortvloeien uit de bepalingen van dit Statuut en die aan het internationale spoorwegverkeer toegestaan mochten zijn onder voorwaarden, die met de beginselen van dit Statuut strooken; het brengt evenmin een verbod mede om zoodanige faciliteiten voortaan te verleenen.  

### Artikel  34  

Overeenkomstig art. 23 *e* van het Volkenbondverdrag zal iedere Verdragstaat, die tegen de toepassing van een der bepalingen van dit Statuut op het geheele, of op een gedeelte van zijn grondgebied geldige bezwaren kan inbrengen, op grond van een ernstigen economischen toestand, die het gevolg is van verwoestingen die op zijn grondgebied zijn aangebracht gedurende den oorlog van 1914–1918, geacht worden tijdelijk te zijn vrijgesteld van de verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit de toepassing van genoemde bepaling, met dien verstande dat de beginselen van dit Statuut in zoo min mogelijke mate zullen moeten worden in acht genomen.  

### Artikel  35  

Wanneer een geschil rijst tusschen twee of meer Verdragstaten inzake de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Statuut en wanneer dit geschil niet beslecht kan worden hetzij rechtstreeks tusschen de Partijen, hetzij langs eenigen anderen weg van minnelijke schikking, zullen de bij het geschil betrokken Partijen, alvorens haar toevlucht te nemen tot eenige scheidsrechterlijke procedure of tot een gerechtelijke beslissing, het geschil, ter fine van advies, kunnen onderwerpen aan het orgaan, dat door den Volkenbond als raadgevend en technisch orgaan van de Leden van den Bond zal zijn aangewezen voor zaken betreffende verkeer en doorvoer. In dringende gevallen kan een voorloopig advies een aanbeveling tot het nemen van alle voorloopige maatregelen inhouden, die in het bijzonder beoogen den vrijen doorvoer de faciliteiten te hergeven, die vóór de behandeling of het feit, dat aanleiding tot het geschil heeft gegeven, werden genoten. Indien het geschil niet beslecht kan worden door middel van een van de procedures die in het voorafgaand lid zijn aangegeven, zullen de Verdragstaten hun geschil onderwerpen aan arbitrage, tenzij zij, krachtens een overeenkomst tusschen de Partijen, besloten hebben of besluiten, het geschil voor het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie te brengen.  

### Artikel  36  

Indien de zaak wordt onderworpen aan het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie, zal zij worden berecht overeenkomstig de voorwaarden neergelegd in art. 27 van het Statuut van dit Hof. Ingeval van arbitrage en tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, zal iedere Partij een scheidsrechter aanwijzen en het derde lid van het scheidsgerecht zal worden gekozen door de scheidsrechters, of indien deze laatsten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen, worden benoemd door den Raad van den Volkenbond uit de lijst van bijzitters voor geschillen inzake doorvoer en verkeer als bedoeld in art. 27 van het Statuut van het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie; in dit laatste geval zal het derde lid gekozen worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het voorlaatste lid van art. 4 en het eerste lid van art. 5 van het Volkenbondverdrag. Het scheidsgerecht zal oordeelen op den grondslag van het compromis, dat in gemeen overleg tusschen de Partijen is vastgesteld. Indien de Partijen niet tot overeenstemming hebben kunnen komen, zal het scheidsgerecht beslissende met algemeene stemmen het compromis vaststellen, na onderzoek van de eischen die de Partijen doen gelden; ingeval geen eenstemmigheid zou worden verkregen, zal de Raad van den Volkenbond het compromis vaststellen overeenkomstig de in het vorige lid bedoelde voorschriften. Indien het compromis de procedure niet vaststelt, zal het scheidsgerecht zelf deze vaststellen. De Partijen verbinden zich, in den loop van de scheidsrechterlijke procedure en behoudens afwijkende bepalingen in het compromis aan het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie te onderwerpen iedere vraag van internationaal recht of ieder punt van juridische uitlegging van dit Statuut, ten aanzien waarvan het scheidsgerecht, op verzoek van een der Partijen, de voorafgaande beslissing noodig zou oordeelen voor de regeling van het geschil.  

### Artikel  37  

De Verdragstaten zullen bevorderen, dat bijzondere overeenkomsten worden gesloten teneinde de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Statuut mogelijk te maken in gevallen, waarin de bestaande overeenkomsten voor dit doel niet voldoende zijn.  

### Artikel  38  

De bepalingen van dit Statuut zullen door middel van bijzondere overeenkomsten kunnen worden uitgestrekt tot ondernemingen, die het vervoer verzorgen langs een anderen weg dan langs spoorwegen, in het bijzonder in die gevallen waarin zoodanige ondernemingen optreden om het spoorwegvervoer aan te vullen. Deze ondernemingen zijn dan onderworpen aan alle opgelegde verplichtingen en in het genot van alle rechten, die door dit Statuut aan den spoorweg worden toegekend. Evenwel zullen de in het eerste lid bedoelde bijzonders overeenkomsten iedere afwijking van dit Statuut, welke zou voortvloeien uit het verschil in geaardheid van het vervoer, kunnen toestaan. In het bijzonder zullen deze afwijkingen voor zoover betreft contracten, van toepassing op een internationaal vervoer, dat gedeeltelijk per spoorweg en gedeeltelijk over zee geschiedt, voorzieningen kunnen treffen voor de toepassing van het zeerecht ten aanzien van het vervoer over zee.  

### Artikel  39  

Bij gebreke van de toepassing van bijzondere overeenkomsten, als bedoeld in art. 38, zullen redelijke faciliteiten worden verleend voor het vervoer, dat gedeeltelijk per spoor gedeeltelijk op andere wijze, bijv. over zee geschiedt.  

### Artikel  40  

De Verdragstaten verplichten zich om in de bestaande Verdragen, die in strijd zouden komen met de bepalingen van dit Statuut, zoodra de omstandigheden dit mogelijk zullen maken en althans op het oogenblik, dat deze verdragen afloopen, alle wijzigingen aan te brengen, waardoor deze verdragen in overeenstemming worden gebracht met de bepalingen van dit Statuut, voor zoover de aardrijkskundige, economische of technische gesteldheid van de landen of streken, die het voorwerp zijn van deze verdragen zulks mogelijk zal maken.  

### Artikel  41  

Onverminderd de toepassing van art. 24 van het Volkenbondverdrag zullen alle bureau's, die ingesteld zijn of ingesteld zullen worden krachtens internationale verdragen, met het doel om de regeling te bevorderen tusschen Staten van vragen betreffende het spoorwegvervoer, geacht worden uit te gaan van dezelfde gedachte als de organen van den Volkenbond en op hun eigen gebied – met het oog op de uitvoering van dit Verdrag – de werkzaamheden van deze organen van den Volkenbond voortzetten; derhalve zullen zij met de bevoegde organen van den Volkenbond alle desbetreffende inlichtingen uitwisselen ten aanzien van de uitoefening van hun taak inzake internationale samenwerking.  

### Artikel  42  

De Verdragstaten zullen alle noodige maatregelen nemen om aan den Volkenbond alle inlichtingen te verstrekken, welke het aan de organisaties van den Bond mogelijk maken om de taak uit te oefenen, die op haar rust inzake de toepassing van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  43  

Het is wel te verstaan, dat dit Statuut niet mag worden uitgelegd in dien zin, dat het op eenigerlei wijze de rechten en verplichtingen *inter se* regelt van gebieden die deel uitmaken van of die geplaatst zijn onder de bescherming van eenzelfden souvereinen Staat, onverschillig of deze gebieden elk voor zich Verdragstaten zijn of niet.  

### Artikel  44  

Niets in de voorafgaande artikelen zal kunnen worden uitgelegd als inbreuk te maken in welk opzicht ook op de rechten en verplichtingen van iederen Verdragstaat als Lid van den Volkenbond.  

####PROTOCOL VAN ONDERTEEKENING VAN HET VERDRAG NOPENS HET INTERNATIONALE SPOORWEGREGIME.

Op het oogenblik, dat zij overgaan tot de onderteekening van het verdrag nopens het internationale spoorwegregime, gesloten op den dag van heden, zijn de ondergeteekenden, behoorlijk daartoe gevolmachtigd, omtrent het volgende overeengekomen: 

1°. Het is wel te verstaan, dat ieder verschil in behandeling van vlaggen, dat uitsluitend gegrond zou zijn op de beschouwing van de vlag, geacht moet worden te zijn een onderscheiding van onwelwillenden aard in den zin van de artt. 4 en 20 van het Statuut nopens het internationale spoorwegregime.  

2°. Ingeval een Staat of grondgebied, waarop het verdrag niet van toepassing is, eenzelfde vlag of eenzelfde nationaliteit zou hebben als een Verdragstaat, zal deze Staat of dit grondgebied geen aanspraak kunnen maken op eenig recht, dat door dit Statuut aan de vlag of aan de onderdanen van de Verdragstaten wordt verzekerd.   Dit protocol zal dezelfde kracht, geldigheid en duur hebben als het Statuut, dat op dezen dag wordt aangenomen en moet als een integreerend deel daarvan worden beschouwd.   
Ten blijke waarvan de bovengenoemde gevolmachtigden dit protocol hebben geteekend. Gedaan te Genève, den negenden December negentienhonderd drie en twintig.
