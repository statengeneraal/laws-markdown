####STATUTE

### Article  1  

All ports which are normally frequented by sea-going vessels and used for foreign trade shall be deemed to be maritime ports within the meaning of the present Statute.  

### Article  2  

Subject to the principle of reciprocity and to the reservation set out in the first paragraph of Article 8, every contracting State undertakes to grant the vessels of every other Contracting State equality of treatment with its own vessels, or those of any other State whatsoever, in the maritime ports situated under its sovereignty or authority, as regards freedom of access to the port, the use of the port, and the full enjoyment of the benefits as regards navigation and commercial operations which it affords to vessels, their cargoes and passengers. The equality of treament thus established shall cover facilities of all kinds, such as allocation of berths, loading and unloading facilities, as well as dues and charges of all kinds levied, in the name or for the account of the Government, public authorities, concessionaries or undertakings of any kind.  

### Article  3  

The provisions of the preceding article in no way restrict the liberty of the competent Port Authorities to take such measures as they may deem expedient for the proper conduct of the business of the port provided that these measures comply with the principle of equality of treatment as defined in the said article.  

### Article  4  

All dues and charges levied for the use of maritime ports shall be duly published before coming into force. The same shall apply to the by-laws and regulations of the port. In each maritime port, the Port Authority shall keep open for inspection by all persons concerned a table of the dues and charges in force, as well as a copy of the by-laws and regulations.  

### Article  5  

In assessing and applying Customs and other analogous duties, local octroi or consumption duties, or incidental charges, levied on the importation or exportation of goods through the maritime ports situated under the sovereignty or authority of the Contracting States, the flag of the vessel must not be taken into account, and accordingly no distinction may be made to the detriment of the flag of any Contracting State whatsoever as between that flag and the flag of the State under whose sovereignty or authority the port is situated, or the flag of any other State whatsoever.  

### Article  6  

In order that the principle of equal treatment in maritime port laid down by Article 2 may not be rendered ineffective in practice by the adoption of other methods of discrimination against the vessels of a Contracting State using such ports, each Contracting State undertakes to apply the provisions of Articles 4, 20, 21 and 22 of the Statute annexed to the Convention on the International Regime of Railways, signed at Geneva on December 9th, 1923, so far as they are applicable to traffic to or from a maritime port, whether or not such Contracting State is a party to the said Convention on the International Regime of Railways. The aforesaid articles are to be interpreted in conformity with the provisions of the Protocol of Signature of the said Convention (See Annex).  

### Article  7  

Unless there are special reasons justifying an exception, such as those based upon special geographical, economic, or technical conditions, the Customs duties levied in any maritime port situated under the sovereignty or authority of a Contracting State may not exceed the duties levied on the other Customs frontiers of the said State on goods of the same kind, source or destination. If for special reasons as set out above, a Contracting State grants special Customs facilities on other routes for the importation or exportation of goods, it shall not use these facilities as a means of discriminating unfairly against importation or exportation through the maritime ports situated under its sovereignty or authority.  

### Article  8  

Each of the Contracting States reserves the power, after giving notice through diplomatic channels, of suspending the benefit of equality of treatment from any vessel of a State which does not effectively apply, in any maritime port situated under its sovereignty or authority, the provisions of this Statute to the vessels of the said Contracting State, their cargoes and passengers. In the event of action being taken as provided in the preceding paragraph, the State which has taken action and the State against which action is taken, shall both alike have the right of applying to the Permanent Court of International Justice by an application addressed to the Registrar; and the Court shall settle the matter in accordance with the rules of summary procedure. Every Contracting State shall, however, have the right, at the time of signing or ratifying this Convention, of declaring that it renounces the right of taking action as provided in the first paragraph of this article against any other State which may make a similar declaration.  

### Article  9  

This Statute does not in any way apply to the maritime coasting trade.  

### Article  10  

Each Contracting State reserves the right to make such arrangements for towage in its maritime ports as it thinks fit, provided that the provisions of Articles 2 and 4 are not thereby infringed.  

### Article  11  

Each Contracting State reserves the right to organise and administer pilotage services as it thinks fit. Where pilotage is compulsory, the dues and facilities offered shall be subject to the provisions of Articles 2 and 4, but each Contracting State may exempt from the obligation of compulsory pilotage such of its nationals as possess the necessary technical qualifications.  

### Article  12  

Each Contracting State shall have the power, at the time of signing or ratifying this Convention, of declaring that it reserves the right of limiting the transport of emigrants, in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation to vessels which have been granted special authorisation as fulfilling the requirements of the said legislation. In exercising this right, however, the Contracting State shall be guided, as far as possible, by the principles of this Statute. The vessels so authorised to transport emigrants shall enjoy all the benefits of this Statute in all maritime ports.  

### Article  13  

This Statute applies to all vessels, whether publicly or privately owned or controlled. It does not, however, apply in any way to warships or vessels performing police or administrative functions or, in general, exercising any kind of public authority, or any other vessels which for the time being are exclusively employed for the purposes of the Naval, Military or Air Forces of a State.  

### Article  14  

This Statute does not in any way apply to fishing vessels or to their catches.  

### Article  15  

Where, in virtue of a treaty, convention or agreement, a Contracting State has granted special rights to another State within a defined area in any of its maritime ports for the purpose of facilitating the transit of goods or passengers to or from the territory of the said State, no other Contracting State can invoke the stipulations of this Statute in support of any claim for similar special rights. Every Contracting State which enjoys the aforesaid special rights in a maritime port of another State, whether contracting or not, shall conform to the provisions of this Statute in its treatment of the vessels trading with it and their cargoes and passengers. Every Contracting State which grants the aforesaid special rights to a non-Contracting State is bound to impose, as one of the conditions of the grant, an obligation on the State which is to enjoy the aforesaid rights to conform to the provisions of this Statute in its treatment of the vessels trading with it and their cargoes and passengers.  

### Article  16  

Measures of a general or particular character which a Contracting State is obliged to take in case of an emergency affecting the safety of the State or the vital interests of the country may, in exceptional cases, and for as short a period as possible, involve a deviation from the provisions of Articles 2 to 7 inclusive; it being understood that the principles of the present Statute must be observed to the utmost possible extent.  

### Article  17  

No Contracting State shall be bound by this Statute to permit the transit of passengers whose admission to its territories is forbidden, or of goods of a kind of which the importation is prohibited, either on grounds of public health or security, or as a precaution against diseases of animals or plants. As regards traffic other than traffic in transit, no Contracting State shall be bound by this Statute to permit the transport of passengers whose admission to its territories is forbidden, or of goods of which the import or export is prohibited, by its national laws. Each Contracting State shall be entitled to take the necessary precautionary measures in respect of the transport of dangerous goods or goods of a similar character, as well as general police measures, including the control of emigrants entering or leaving its territory, it being understood that such measures must not result in any discrimination contrary to the principles of the present Statute. Nothing in this Statute shall affect the measures which one of the Contracting States is or may feel called upon to take in pursuance of general international conventions to which it is a party, or which may he concluded hereafter, particularly conventions concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations, relating to the traffic in women and children, the transit, export or import of particular kinds of articles such as opium or other dangerous drugs, arms, or the produce of fisheries, or in pursuance of general conventions intended to prevent any infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property, or relating to false marks, false indications of origin or other methods of unfair competition.  

### Article  18  

This Statute does not prescribe the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The Statute shall, however, continue in force in time of war so far as such rights and duties permit.  

### Article  19  

The Contracting States undertake to introduce into those conventions in force on December 9th, 1923, which contravene the provisions of this Statute, so soon as circumstances permit and in any case on the expiry of such conventions, the modifications required to bring them into harmony with such provisions, so far as the geographical, economic or technical circumstances of the countries or areas concerned allow. The same shall apply to concessions granted before December 9th, 1923, for the total or partial exploitation of maritime ports.  

### Article  20  

This Statute does not entail in any way the withdrawal of facilities which are greater than those provided for in the Statute and which have been granted in respect of the use of maritime ports under conditions consistent with its principles. This Statute also entails no prohibition of such grant of greater facilities in the future.  

### Article  21  

Without prejudice to the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 8, disputes which may arise between Contracting States as to the interpretation or the application of the present Statute shall be settled in the following manner: Should it prove impossible to settle such dispute either directly between the Parties or by any other method of amicable settlement, the Parties to the dispute may, before resorting to any procedure of arbitration or to a judicial settlement, submit the dispute for an advisory opinion to the body established by the League of Nations as the advisory and technical organisation of Members of the League for matters of communications and transit. In urgent cases a preliminary opinion may be given recommending temporary measures, including measures to restore the facilities for international traffic which existed before the act or occurrence which gave rise to the dispute. Should it prove impossible to settle the dispute by any of the methods of procedure enumerated in the preceding paragraph, the Contracting States shall submit their dispute to arbitration, unless they have decided or shall decide under an agreement between them, to bring it before the Permanent Court of International Justice.  

### Article  22  

If the case is submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice, it shall he heard and determined under the conditions laid down in Article 27 of the Statute of the Court. If arbitration is resorted to, and unless the Parties decide otherwise, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator, and a third member of the arbitral tribunal shall be elected by the arbitrators, or, in case the latter are unable to agree, shall be selected by the Council of the League of Nations from the list of assessors for Communications and Transit cases mentioned in Article 27 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice; in such latter case, the third arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the provisions of the penultimate paragraph of Article 4 and the first paragraph of Article 5 of the Covenant of the League. The arbitral tribunal shall judge the case on the basis of the terms of reference mutually agreed upon between the Parties. If the Parties have failed to reach an agreement, the arbitral tribunal, acting unanimously, shall itself draw up terms of reference after considering the claims formulated by the Parties; if unanimity cannot be obtained, the Council of the League of Nations shall decide the terms of reference under the conditions laid down in the preceding paragraph. If the procedure is not determined by the terms of reference, it shall be settled by the arbitral tribunal. During the course of the arbitration the Parties, in the absence of any contrary provision in the terms of reference, are bound to submit to the Permanent Court of International Justice any question of international law or question as to the legal meaning of this Statute the solution of which the arbitral tribunal, at the request of one of the Parties, pronounces to be a necessary preliminary to the settlement of the dispute.  

### Article  23  

It is understood that this Statute must not be interpreted as regulating in any way rights and obligations *inter se* of territories forming part of or placed under the protection of the same sovereign State, whether or not these territories are individually Contracting States.  

### Article  24  

Nothing in the preceding articles is to be construed as affecting in any way the rights or duties of a Contracting State as Member of the League of Nations.  

### ANNEX.  

####Text of the articles of the Statute on the International Regime of Railways and of the provisions relating thereto contained in the Protocol of Signature.

*Article 4.* Recognising the necessity of granting sufficient elasticity in the operation of railways to allow the complex needs of traffic to be met, it is the intention of the Contracting States to maintain unimpaired full freedom of operation while ensuring that such freedom, is exercised without detriment to international traffic. They undertake to give reasonable facilities to international traffic and to refrain from all discrimination of an unfair nature directed against the other Contracting States, their nationals or their vessels. The benefit of the provisions of the present article is not confined to traffic governed by a single contract; it extends also to the traffic dealt with in Articles 21 and 22 of the present Statute subject to the conditions specified in the said articles. *Article 20.* The Contracting States, recognising the necessity in general of leaving tariffs sufficient flexibility to permit of their being adapted as closely as possible to the complex needs of trade and commercial competition retain full freedom to frame their tariffs in accordance with the principles accepted by their own legislation, provided that this freedom is exercised without detriment to international traffic. They undertake to apply to international traffic tariffs which are reasonable both as regards their amounts and the conditons of their application, and undertake to refrain from all discrimination of an unfair nature directed against the other Contracting States, their nationals or their vessels. These provisions shall not prevent the establishment of combined rail and sea tariffs which comply with the principles laid down in the previous paragraphs. *Article 21.* The benefit of the provisions of Article 20 shall not be confined to transport based on single contracts. It shall extend equally to transport made up of successive stages by rail, by sea or by any other mode of transport traversing the territory of more than one Contracting State and regulated by separate contracts, subjet to the fulfilment of the following conditions: Each of the successive contracts must specify the initial source and final destination of the consignment; during the whole duration of carriage the goods must remain under the supervision of the carriers and must be forwarded by each carrier to his successor direct and without delay other than that necessary for the completion of the transport operations and the Customs, octroi, police or other administrative formalities. *Article 22.* The provisions of Article 20 shall be equally applicable to internal, as well as to international, traffic by rail as regards goods which remain temporarily at the port without regard to the flag under which they have been imported or will be exported. *Protocol of Signature.* It is understood that any differential treatment of flags based solely on the consideration of the flag should be considered as discrimination of an unfair nature in the sense of Articles 4 and 20 of the Statute on the International Regime of Railways.

####STATUUT.

### Artikel  1  

Als zeehavens in den zin van dit Statuut worden beschouwd de havens, die geregeld door zeeschepen worden bezocht en openstaan voor den buitenlandschen handel.  

### Artikel  2  

Op voorwaarde van wederkeerigheid en onder het voorbehoud, bedoeld in art. 8, lid 1, verbindt iedere Verdragstaat zich, in de zeehavens, die onder zijn souvereiniteit of zijn autoriteit zijn geplaatst, aan de vaartuigen van iederen anderen Verdragstaat een behandeling te verzekeren gelijk aan die van zijn eigen vaartuigen of van de vaartuigen van welken anderen Staat ook, wat betreft de vrijheid van toegang tot de haven, het gebruik er van en het volledig genot van de voordeelen, die deze inzake scheepvaart en handelsverrichtingen biedt aan vaartuigen, hun goederen en hun passagiers. De aldus vastgestelde gelijkheid van behandeling zal zich uitstrekken over alle soorten van faciliteiten, zooals toewijzing van ligplaatsen aan de kaden en faciliteiten bij het laden en lossen, alsmede over de rechten en heffingen van welken aard ook, die namens of voor rekening van de Regeering, openbare organen, concessionarissen of ondernemingen van welken aard ook worden geheven.  

### Artikel  3  

De bepalingen van het vorige artikel beperken in geenen deele de vrijheid van de bevoegde overheden van een zeehaven om de maatregelen te nemen, die zij dienstig achten voor een goed beheer van de haven, mits deze maatregelen in overeenstemming zijn met het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling als omschreven in genoemd artikel.  

### Artikel  4  

Alle rechten en belastingen, die voor het gebruik van de zeehavens worden geheven, moeten naar behooren worden bekend gemaakt vóór hun inwerkingtreding. Hetzelfde zal gelden voor de verordeningen en reglementen van politie en betreffende de havenexploitatie. In iedere zeehaven zal de havenadministratie een verzameling van de geldende rechten en belastingen, alsmede van de verordeningen en reglementen van politie en betreffende de havenexploitatie ter inzage beschikbaar houden voor de betrokkenen.  

### Artikel  5  

Bij de vaststelling en de toepassing van de douane- en daarmede gelijk te stellen rechten, van de plaatselijke octrooi- of verbruiksrechten, alsmede van de bijkomstige rechten, die bij den invoer of uitvoer van de goederen geheven worden door de zeehavens, die geplaatst zijn onder de souvereiniteit of de autoriteit van de Verdragstaten, zal geen rekening mogen worden gebonden met de vlag van het vaartuig, zulks in dier voege, dat ten nadeele van de vlag van eenigen Verdragstaat geen onderscheid zal worden gemaakt tusschen deze laatste vlag en de vlag van den Staat, onder wiens souvereiniteit of autoriteit de haven is geplaatst of de vlag van welken anderen Staat ook.  

### Artikel  6  

Teneinde te voorkomen, dat aan het beginsel van gelijkheid van behandeling in de zeehavens, zooals dit in art. 2 is neergelegd, in de praktijk alle beteekenis zal worden ontnomen door de aanvaarding van andere maatregelen van differentiatie tegen de vaartuigen van een Verdragstaat, die van de bedoelde havens gebruik maken, verbindt iedere Verdragstaat zich, de bepalingen van de artikelen 4, 20, 21 en 22 van het Statuut, toegevoegd aan het verdrag, nopens het internationale spoorwegregime, geteekend te Genève op 9 December 1923, toe te passen, voor zoover deze artikelen van toepassing zijn op vervoer, afkomstig uit of bestemd voor een zeehaven, onverschillig of deze Verdragstaat al dan niet Partij is bij genoemd verdrag nopens het internationale spoorwegregime. Bovengenoemde artikelen moeten worden uitgelegd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Protocol van onderteekening van genoemd verdrag (zie Bijlage).  

### Artikel  7  

Tenzij er uitzonderingsredenen zijn, die een afwijking rechtvaardigen, inzonderheid die, gegrond op bijzondere aardrijkskundige, economische of technische overwegingen, zullen de douanerechten, geheven in eenige zeehaven, staande onder de souvereiniteit of de autoriteit van een Verdragstaat, niet hooger mogen zijn dan die, welke aan de andere douanegrenzen van denzelfden Staat van goederen van dezelfde soort, van dezelfde herkomst of met dezelfde bestemming worden geheven. Indien, om bovenbedoelde uitzonderingsredenen door een Verdragstaat bijzondere douanefaciliteiten worden verleend op andere wegen, waarlangs goederen worden in- of uitgevoerd, zal deze Staat die faciliteiten niet gebruiken als een middel tot onredelijke differentiatie, ten nadeele van den in- of uitvoer, welke geschiedt door de onder zijn souvereiniteit of autoriteit geplaatste zeehavens.  

### Artikel  8  

Ieder van de Verdragstaten behoudt zich de bevoegdheid voor om, na langs den diplomatieken weg hiervan te hebben kennis gegeven, het voorrecht van gelijkheid van behandeling te schorsen, ten aanzien van ieder vaartuig van een Staat, die niet op afdoende wijze in eenige onder zijn souvereiniteit of autoriteit geplaatste zeehaven, de bepalingen van dit Statuut toepast op de vaartuigen van den bedoelden Verdragstaat, op hun goederen en hun passagiers. In geval van toepassing van den in het vorig lid bedoelden maatregel, zal zoowel de Staat die daartoe is overgegaan, als de Staat tegen wien deze maatregel zal zijn gericht, het recht hebben zich door middel van een tot den Griffier gericht request te wenden tot het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie; het Hof zal in kort geding uitspraak doen. Iedere Verdragstaat zal echter de bevoegdheid hebben, op het oogenblik van onderteekening of van bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag te verklaren, dat hij ten aanzien van alle andere Verdragstaten, die dezelfde verklaring afleggen, afstand doet van het recht om de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen te nemen.  

### Artikel  9  

Dit Statuut is in geen enkel opzicht van toepassing op de zeekustvaart.  

### Artikel  10  

Iedere Verdragstaat behoudt zich het recht voor den sleepdienst in zijn zeehavens in te richten zooals hij wenschelijk oordeelt, mits de bepalingen van de artikelen 2 en 4 worden in acht genomen.  

### Artikel  11  

Iedere Verdragstaat behoudt zich het recht voor den loodsdienst in te richten of te reglementeeren zooals hij wenschelijk oordeelt. Ingeval het gebruik maken van den loodsdienst verplicht is, zullen de tarieven en de bewezen diensten onderworpen zijn aan de bepalingen van de artikelen 2 en 4, maar iedere Verdragstaat zal diegenen van zijn onderdanen, die aan bepaalde technische voorwaarden voldoen, van den loodsdwang kunnen vrijstellen.  

### Artikel  12  

Iedere Verdragstaat zal de bevoegdheid hebben, op het oogenblik van onderteekening of van bekrachtiging van dit verdrag te verklaren, dat hij zich het recht voorbehoudt, in overeenstemming met zijn eigen wetgeving en zich daarbij zooveel mogelijk latende leiden door de beginselen van dit Statuut, het vervoer van emigranten te beperken tot vaartuigen, waaraan hij een bijzondere vergunning zal hebben gegeven ten bewijze dat zij voldoen aan de voorwaarden in bovenbedoelde wetgeving gesteld. De vaartuigen, die gemachtigd zijn tot het vervoer van emigranten, zullen in alle zeehavens alle in dit Statuut bedoelde voorrechten genieten.  

### Artikel  13  

Dit Statuut is van toepassing op alle vaartuigen, onverschillig of zij aan particulieren, aan den Staat, of aan andere openbare lichamen toebehooren. Evenwel is het in geen enkel opzicht toepasselijk op oorlogsvaartuigen of vaartuigen voor politie- of contrôledoeleinden, noch in het algemeen op vaartuigen, die in een of anderen vorm Overheidsgezag uitoefenen, evenmin als op alle andere vaartuigen gedurende den tijd, dat deze uitsluitend gebruikt worden ten bate van de zee-, land- of luchtstrijdkrachten van een Staat.  

### Artikel  14  

Dit Statuut is in geen enkel opzicht toepasselijk op visschersvaartuigen of op hun vangst.  

### Artikel  15  

Wanneer een Verdragstaat bij verdrag, overeenkomst of afspraak zekere rechten aan een anderen Staat heeft verleend in een omschreven zone van een zijner zeehavens, teneinde den doorvoer van goederen en passagiers met bestemming naar of herkomstig van bedoelden Staat te bevorderen, zal geen andere Verdragstaat zich kunnen beroepen op de bepalingen van dit Statuut om overeenkomstige rechten op te eischen. Iedere Verdragstaat, die zoodanige rechten geniet in een zeehaven van een anderen Staat, onverschillig of deze al dan niet partij is bij dit verdrag, zal zich overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Statuut moeten gedragen ten aanzien van de behandeling van de vaartuigen die met hem handel drijven, en van hun goederen en de passagiers. Iedere Verdragstaat, die zoodanige rechten toekent aan een Staat, die geen partij is bij dit verdrag, is gehouden, in de afspraak, die te dien einde wordt getroffen, aan den Staat, die deze rechten zal genieten, de verplichting op te leggen, zich overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Statuut te gedragen, ten aanzien van de behandeling van de vaartuigen, die met hem handel drijven, evenals van de goederen en de passagiers van die vaartuigen.  

### Artikel  16  

Bij uitzondering kan, voor een zooveel mogelijk beperkten termijn, afgeweken worden van de bepalingen der artikelen 2 tot en met 7 door bijzondere of algemeene maatregelen, die een der Verdragstaten genoodzaakt zou zijn te nemen in geval van ernstige gebeurtenissen, die de veiligheid van den Staat of de levensbelangen van het land raken, met dien verstande, dat de beginselen van dit Statuut in zoo mogelijke mate moeten worden gehandhaafd.  

### Artikel  17  

Geen der Verdragstaten is door dit Statuut gehouden om doorvoer toe te staan van reizigers, wier toelating op zijn gebied verboden is of van goederen van een bepaalde soort, waarvan de invoer is verboden, hetzij om redenen van openbare gezondheid of veiligheid, hetzij als voorzorg tegen ziekten van dieren of planten. Wat betreft het vervoer dat geen doorvoer is, is geen der Verdragstaten gehouden door dit Statuut het vervoer van reizigers toe te staan, wier toelating op zijn gebied verboden is, of van goederen, waarvan de invoer of uitvoer verboden is krachtens de nationale wetten. Iedere Verdragstaat zal het recht hebben de noodige voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen nopens het vervoer van gevaarlijke of daarmede gelijk te stellen goederen, evenals maatregelen van algemeen politioneelen aard, met inbegrip van de politie op de emigranten, die zijn gebied binnenkomen of verlaten, met dien verstande, dat zoodanige maatregelen niet moeten leiden tot eenige differentiatie in strijd met de beginselen van dit Statuut. Niets in dit Statuut zal een beletsel zijn voor de maatregelen, die een der Verdragstaten heeft genomen of zal wenschen te nemen krachtens algemeene internationale verdragen, waarbij hij partij is, of die later gesloten mochten worden, met name die, welke onder de auspiciën van den Volkenbond zijn gesloten, met betrekking tot den handel in vrouwen en kinderen, den doorvoer, den uitvoer of den invoer van een bijzondere soort van goederen, zooals opium of andere schadelijke zelfstandigheden, wapenen of de voortbrengselen van de visscherij, of wel krachtens algemeene verdragen, ten doel hebbende iedere inbreuk te voorkomen op de rechten van industriëelen, letterkundigen of artistieken eigendom of betrekking hebbende op valsche merken, valsche aanwijzingen van oorsprong of andere wijzen van oneerlijken handel.  

### Artikel  18  

Dit Statuut stelt niet de rechten en verplichtingen der oorlogvoerenden en der onzijdigen in tijd van oorlog vast. Niettemin zal het Statuut in oorlogstijd van kracht blijven in de mate, die met die rechten en verplichtingen vereenigbaar is.  

### Artikel  19  

De Verdragstaten verbinden zich in die verdragen, die op 9 December 1923 van kracht zijn en welke in strijd mochten zijn met de bepalingen van dit Statuut, zoodra de omstandigheden dit mogelijk maken en althans bij het afloopen van deze verdragen, de wijzigingen aan te brengen, noodig om ze met die bepalingen te doen overeenstemmen, voor zoover de aardrijkskundige, economische of technische omstandigheden der landen of streken, die het onderwerp van die verdragen uitmaken, het toelaten. Hetzelfde geldt ten aanzien van concessies tot geheele of gedeeltelijke exploitatie van zeehavens, welke vóór 9 December 1923 zijn verleend.  

### Artikel  20  

Dit Statuut brengt geenszins mede de intrekking van thans geldende ruimere faciliteiten, die mochten zijn toegestaan inzake het gebruik van zeehavens onder voorwaarden, die met de beginselen van dit Statuut strooken. Evenmin brengt het Statuut een verbod mede om zoodanige faciliteiten voortaan te verleenen.  

### Artikel  21  

Onverminderd de bepaling voorzien in art. 8, lid 2, zullen de geschillen, die mochten rijzen tusschen Verdragstaten inzake de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Statuut op de volgende wijze beslecht worden: Indien het geschil niet beslecht kan worden, hetzij rechtstreeks tusschen de Partijen, hetzij langs eenigen anderen weg van minnelijke schikking, zullen de bij het geschil betrokken Partijen, alvorens haar toevlucht te nemen tot eenige scheidsrechterlijke procedure of tot een gerechtelijke beslissing, het geschil, ter fine van advies, kunnen onderwerpen aan het orgaan, dat door den Volkenbond als raadgevend en technisch orgaan van de Leden van den Bond zal zijn aangewezen voor zaken van verkeer en doorvoer. ln dringende gevallen kan een voorloopig advies een aanbeveling tot het nemen van alle voorloopige maatregelen inhouden, die in het bijzonder beoogen aan het internationale verkeer de faciliteiten te hergeven, die vóór de handeling of het feit, dat aanleiding tot het geschil heeft gegeven, werden genoten. Indien het geschil niet beslecht kan worden door middel van een van de procedures, die in het voorafgaand lid zijn aangegeven, zullen de Verdragstaten hun geschil onderwerpen aan arbitrage, tenzij zij, krachtens een afspraak tusschen de Partijen, besloten hebben of besluiten het geschil voor het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie te brengen.  

### Artikel  22  

Indien de zaak wordt onderworpen aan het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie, zal zij worden berecht overeenkomstig de voorwaarden, vastgesteld in art. 27 van het Statuut van dit Hof. Ingeval van arbitrage en tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, zal iedere Partij een scheidsrechter aanwijzen en het derde lid van het scheidsgerecht zal worden gekozen door de scheidsrechters, of indien deze laatsten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen, worden benoemd door den Raad van den Volkenbond uit de lijst van bijzitters voor zaken van verkeer en doorvoer als bedoeld in art. 27 van het Statuut van het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie; in dit laatste geval zal het derde lid gekozen worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het voorlaatste lid van art. 4 en het eerste lid van art. 5 van het Volkenbondverdrag. Het scheidsgerecht zal oordeelen op den grondslag van het compromis, dat in gemeen overleg door de Partijen zal zijn vastgesteld. Indien de Partijen niet tot overeenstemming hebben kunnen komen, zal het scheidsgerecht, beslissende met algemeene stemmen, het compromis vaststellen, na onderzoek van de eischen, die de Partijen doen gelden; ingeval geen eenstemmigheid wordt verkregen, zal de Raad van den Volkenbond het compromis vaststellen overeenkomstig de in het vorig lid bedoelde voorschriften. Indien het compromis de procedure niet aangeeft, zal het scheidsgerecht zelf deze vaststellen. De Partijen verbinden zich, in den loop van de scheidsrechterlijke procedure en behoudens afwijkende bepalingen in het compromis, aan het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie te onderwerpen iedere vraag van internationaal recht of ieder punt van juridische uitlegging van dit Statuut, ten aanzien waarvan het scheidsgerecht, op verzoek van een der Partijen, voorafgaande beslissing noodig zou oordeelen voor de beslechting van het geschil.  

### Artikel  23  

Het is wel te verstaan, dat dit Statuut niet mag worden uitgelegd in dien zin, dat het op eenigerlei wijze de rechten en verplichtingen *inter se* regelt van gebieden, die deel uitmaken van of die geplaatst zijn onder de bescherming van eenzelfden souvereinen Staat, onverschillig of deze gebieden elk voor zich Verdragstaten zijn of niet.  

### Artikel  24  

Niets in de voorafgaande artikelen zal kunnen worden uitgelegd als in welk opzicht ook inbreuk te maken op de rechten en verplichtingen van eenigen Verdragstaat als Lid van den Volkenbond.  

### AANHANGSEL.  

####TEKST VAN DE ARTIKELEN VAN HET STATUUT NOPENS HET INTERNATIONALE SPOORWEGREGIME, EN VAN DE DESBETREFFENDE BEPALINGEN VAN HET PROTOCOL VAN ONDERTEEKENING.

*Artikel 4.* De Verdragstaten, de noodzakelijkheid erkennende om de exploitatie van de spoorwegen te doen geschieden met de soepelheid, noodig om te voldoen aan de veelzijdige behoeften van het verkeer, geven als hun voornemen te kennen de vrijheid van deze exploitatie onaangetast te laten, met dien verstande dat er voor gewaakt zal worden dat deze vrijheid wordt uitgeoefend zonder schade voor het internationale verkeer. Zij verbinden zich aan het internationale verkeer redelijke faciliteiten te verleenen en zich te onthouden van iedere onderscheiding, die een onwelwillend karakter zou dragen ten opzichte van andere Verdragstaten, hun onderdanen of hun schepen. De bepalingen van dit artikel komen niet alleen ten goede aan doorvoer beheerscht door een enkelvoudig contract, zij hebben eveneens betrekking op doorvoeren als bedoeld in artt. 21 en 22 van dit Statuut, op de voorwaarden als aangegeven in deze artikelen. *Artikel 20.* De Verdragstaten, de noodzakelijkheid erkennende om in het algemeen aan de tarieven de noodige soepelheid te laten, waardoor zij zoo nauwkeurig mogelijk zich kunnen aanpassen aan de veelzijdige behoeften van den handel en de handelsconcurrentie, behouden volle vrijheid om hun tarieven te bepalen volgens de beginselen nedergelegd in hun eigen wetgeving, met dien verstande echter, dat zij er voor waken, dat deze vrijheid niet uitgeoefend wordt ten nadeele van het internationale verkeer. Zij verbinden zich op het internationale verkeer redelijke tarieven toe te passen, zoowel wat betreft de hoogte van de tarieven als de voorwaarden van toepassing, en komen overeen zich te onthouden van iedere onderscheiding, die een onwelwillend karakter zou dragen ten aanzien van andere Verdragstaten, hun onderdanen of hun schepen. Deze bepalingen zijn niet onvereenigbaar met het instellen van gemeenschappelijke spoorweg- en scheepvaarttarieven, mits de beginselen nedergelegd in het voorafgaande lid worden geëerbiedigd. *Artikel 21.* Het voordeel van de bepalingen van art. 20 wordt niet beperkt tot vervoer, dat beheerscht wordt door een enkelvoudig contract. Het strekt zich eveneens uit tot het vervoer over een reeks trajecten per spoor, over zee of langs eenigen anderen weg, over de gebieden van meerdere Verdragstaten en beheerscht door afzonderlijke contracten, mits de volgende voorwaarden worden vervuld: Ieder van de opvolgende contracten moet de oorspronkelijke herkomst en de eindbestemming van het vervoer vermelden; de goederen moeten gedurende den duur van het geheele traject onder het toezicht blijven van de transporteurs en door ieder van hen aan den volgende rechtstreeks worden overgegeven, zonder eenig ander oponthoud dan dat hetwelk noodig is voor het bewerkstelligen van de overgave en het vervullen van de administratieve douane-, octrooi-, politie- of andere formaliteiten. *Artikel 22.* De bepalingen van art. 20 zijn, zoowel in het nationale als in het internationale spoorwegverkeer, eveneens van toepassing op goederen, die tijdelijk in een haven worden opgeslagen, zonder dat rekening wordt gehouden met de vlag, waaronder deze goederen zij ingevoerd of zullen worden uitgevoerd. *Protocol van onderteekening:* Het is wel te verstaan, dat ieder verschil in behandeling van vlaggen, dat uitsluitend gegrond zou zijn op de beschouwing van de vlag, geacht moet worden te zijn een onderscheiding van onwelwillenden aard in den zin van de artt. 4 en 20 van het Statuut nopens het internationale spoorwegregime.   

####PROTOCOL VAN ONDERTEEKENING VAN HET VERDRAG NOPENS HET INTERNATIONALE ZEEHAVENREGIME.

Op het oogenblik, dat zij overgaan tot de onderteekening van het verdrag nopens het internationale zeehavenregime, gesloten op den dag van heden, zijn de ondergeteekenden behoorlijk daartoe gevolmachtigd, omtrent het volgende overeengekomen: 

1°. Het is wel te verstaan, dat de bepalingen van dit Statuut van toepassing zullen zijn op de vluchthavens, die speciaal voor dit doel zijn aangelegd.  

2°. Het is wel te verstaan, dat het door de Britsche delegatie gemaakte voorbehoud ten aanzien van de bepalingen van sectie 24 van de „Pilotage Act” van 1913 aanvaard wordt.  

3°. Het is wel te verstaan, dat de door de Fransche wetgeving voorziene verplichtingen met betrekking tot scheepsmakelaars niet zullen worden beschouwd als te zijn in strijd met het beginsel en den geest van het Statuut nopens het internationale zeehavenregime.  

4°. Het is wel te verstaan, dat de voorwaarde van wederkeerigheid, neergelegd in artikel 2 van het Statuut nopens het internationale zeehavenregime, niet ten gevolge zal hebben, dat Verdragstaten, die geen zeehavens bezitten, en die niet in een zone van een zeehaven van een anderen Staat de in artikel 15 van het hierboven bedoelde Statuut vermelde rechten genieten, van de voordeelen van genoemd Statuut worden uitgesloten.  

5°. Ingeval een Staat of gebied, waarop het verdrag niet van toepassing is, dezelfde vlag of dezelfde nationaliteit heeft als een Verdragstaat, zal deze Staat of dit gebied geen aanspraak kunnen maken op eenig recht, dat door het Statuut nopens het internationale zeehavenregime aan de vlag of aan de onderdanen van den Verdragstaat wordt verzekerd.   Dit protocol zal dezelfde kracht, geldigheid en duur hebben als het Statuut, dat op dezen dag wordt aangenomen en moet als een integreerend deel daarvan worden beschouwd.   
Ten blijke waarvan de bovengenoemde gevolmachtigden dit protocol hebben geteekend. Gedaan te Genève, den negenden December negentienhonderd drie en twintig, in een enkel exemplaar, dat bewaard zal blijven in het archief van het Secretariaat van den Volkenbond; eensluidend afschrift er van zal worden toegezonden aan alle Staten, die op de Conferentie vertegenwoordigd waren.
