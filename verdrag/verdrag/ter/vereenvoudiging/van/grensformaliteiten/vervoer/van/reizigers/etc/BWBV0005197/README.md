####International Convention to facilitate the Crossing of Frontiers for Passengers and Baggage carried by rail

The undersigned, duly authorized, Meeting at Geneva, under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe, For the purpose of facilitating the crossing of frontiers for passengers carried by rail,   Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####Establishment and operation of frontier stations where examinations are carried out by the two adjoining countries

### Article  1  

1.  On every railway line carrying a considerable volume of international traffic, which crosses the frontier between two adjoining countries, the competent authorities of those countries shall, wherever examination cannot be satisfactorily carried out while the trains are in motion, jointly examine the possibility of designating by agreement a station close to the frontier, at which shall be carried out the examinations required under the legislation of the two countries in respect of the entry and exit of passengers and their baggage.   
2.  Where two adjoining countries designate several stations of this kind along their common frontier, the number of such stations on either side of the frontier shall, so far as possible, be equal.   

### Article  2  

1.  Whenever a station is designated in accordance with article 1, a zone shall be set up within which officials and agents of the competent administrations of the country adjoining the territory on which the station is established (hereinafter referred to as the “adjoining country”) shall be entitled to examine passengers crossing the frontier in either direction, their baggage and also parcels carried by international passenger trains.   
2.  As a general rule this zone shall comprise: 

(a) a specified area of the station;  

(b) passenger trains and the section of the track on which they stand throughout the whole period of the examination;  

(c) such parts of platforms and tracks as may be agreed in each case by the competent administrations of the countries concerned; and  

(d) passenger trains between the station and the frontier of the adjoining country.     

### Article  3  

Application, within the zone established in accordance with article 2, of the laws and regulations of the adjoining country as well as the powers, rights and duties pertaining within the zone to officials and agents of the competent administrations of that country, shall be the subject of bilateral agreements between the competent authorities of the countries concerned.  

### Article  4  

1.  The competent administrations of the countries concerned shall determine by special agreements what premises are needed by the services of the adjoining country within the said zone and the conditions under which the railway administration of the country in whose territory the station is situated shall supply furniture, lighting, heating, cleaning, telephone communications, etc, for the said premises.   
2.  Any equipment required for the functioning of the services of the adjoining country shall be imported on a temporary basis and re-exported free of all Customs duties and charges, provided that the proper declaration is made. Regulations forbidding or restricting import or export shall not apply to such equipment.   

### Article  5  

1.  The premises allotted to the services of the adjoining country within the zone set up in accordance with article 2 may be distinguished on the outside by a notice including a shield in the national colours of that country.   
2.  Officials and agents of the competent administrations of the adjoining country shall wear national uniform or the distinguishing badge prescribed by the regulations of that country.   
3.  Officials and agents of the competent administrations of the adjoining country who are called on to go to the station in order to carry out the examinations provided for in this Convention shall be exempt from passport formalities. Production of their offical papers shall be deemed sufficient proof of their nationality, identity, rank and of the nature of their duties.   
4.  The officials and agents mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article shall enjoy, in, the exercise of their duties, the same protection and assistance as the corresponding officials and agents of the country in whose territory the station is situated.   
5.  Exemption from taxes and charges may be granted under the bilateral agreements provided for in article 3 to officials and agents of the adjoining country residing in the country in whose territory the station is situated.   
6.  The bilateral agreements referred to in article 3 shall determine: 

(a) the maximum numbers of officials and agents of the competent administrations of the adjoining country authorized to carry out examinations in the zone established in accordance with article 2;  

(b) the conditions under which their recall may be demanded; and  

(c) the conditions under which they may carry arms and use them in the exercise of their duties within the said zone.     

### Article  6  

1.  In principle, examinations shall be carried out in through vestibule-coaches of international trains, whenever such coaches are used. Railway officials and agents shall give all necessary assistance in order to ensure effective and speedy examinations. They shall, in particular, co-operate in preventing passengers, subject to examination, from leaving or moving up or down the train until the examination is completed. As an exceptional measure, such examinations may be carried out in the Customs examination sheds of the station, Whenever the administration concerned deems it necessary.   
2.  In principle, the examinations referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be carried out in the following order: 

(a) police examinations by the country of exit;  

(b) customs and other examination by the country of exit;  

(c) police examination by the country of entry; and  

(d) customs and other examination by the country of entry.     
3.  Examinations by officials and agents of the country of entry may only be carried out in those parts of the train already examined by the officials and agents of the country of exit and the latter may not re-examine any parts of the train which they have already cleared, unless special provision be made to the contrary in the bilateral agreements.   
4.  For international trains of normal composition, namely ten to twelve coaches without overload, the wait required at the station for carrying out the said examinations shall not, in principle, exceed forty minutes; for smaller trains, and in particular for railcars, it shall be reduced to the minimum.   
5.  With a view to carrying out the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article, the railway administrations shall notify the competent authorities of the countries of entry and exit in due time of any changes in the frequency, timing and composition of international trains.   

### Article  7  

In so far as currency control is in force in the territories of Contracting Parties, currency control measures shall be carried out within the time-limits laid down in article 6, paragraph 4. The authorities concerned shall do their utmost to arrange for these operations to be carried out in such a way as to avoid any additional inconvenience to passengers.  

### Article  8  

On all main routes the Contracting Parties shall establish direct railway service telephone lines between the frontier stations of the adjoining countries and take steps to facilitate and accelerate private telephone communications. The privilege of establishing direct telephone communications may, by bilateral agreement, be extended to other public services.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####Police and Customs examination while the train is in motion

### Article  9  

1.  Police and Customs examinations on international trains shall, so far as possible, be carried out while the train is in motion, provided that such examinations prove more effective and at the same time more convenient for the passengers: 

(a) whenever the non-stop run, either before or after the frontier station of each of the two adjoining countries, allows sufficient time on its territory for completion of the necessary formalities; and  

(b) provided examination while the train is in motion enables the waits either at frontier stations or at stations where examinations are carried out by the two adjoining countries to be appreciably reduced.     
2.  In cases where it is deemed necessary, in order to expedite examination or to eliminate stops at frontiers to authorize the officials or agents of an adjoining country to board international trains and carry out examinations therein on the territory of the other adjoining country, the competent authorities of the two countries shall determine, by a bilateral agreement, the conditions under which such operations shall be conducted.   
3.  On international trains, the examination of registered baggage, where not carried under the international transit system described in article 10, shall be conducted so far as possible while the train is in motion, provided that such examination is of assistance to passengers travelling with such baggage.   
4.  The procedure for applying the provisions of the present article shall be laid down in agreements concluded between the competent administrations of the Contracting Parties.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####International transport under Customs control of baggage and parcels carried by international passenger trains

### Article  10  

1.  In order to avoid, in principle, examination of the registered baggage of passengers in transit through the territory of a country, and of parcels carried in transit by international passenger trains, the Customs and other administrations concerned of the Contracting Parties shall, in agreement with the railway administrations of the said Parties, take special measures, such as sealing baggage compartments or vans, or the containers, skips or sacks in which such baggage is carried, or affixing seals to the parcels themselves, provided an international Customs declaration form is completed.   
2.  In agreement with the railway administrations of the countries concerned, the Customs and other administrations concerned of the said countries shall establish, so far as possible, offices at those stations in the interior of the said countries where international traffic is particularly heavy, in order to permit the Customs clearance and other examinations of registered baggage and of parcels carried by passenger trains, either before departure from such stations or on arrival there. Between one such station in the interior of a country and a frontier station in either direction or between two such stations in the interior of two countries, such baggage and parcels may be carried under the international transit system referred to in paragraph 1 of this article.   
3.  Railway administrations shall wherever possible endeavour to arrange for registered baggage and parcels carried by international passenger trains to be cleared through the Customs and to undergo the other examinations before they are loaded at the station of dispatch.   
4.  If at frontier stations packages cannot be cleared through the Customs and examined in the time specified under article 6, paragraph 4, they shall be unloaded and the train shall not be held up.   
5.  With a view to the application of the provisions of the present Chapter: 

(a) the Contracting Parties shall recognize, in principle, the Customs seals of the other Contracting Parties, subject to the right of each Customs administration to add its own seal should it deem this essential;  

(b) the Contracting Parties shall adopt the standard international Customs declaration form annexed to this Convention, unless any simpler system is in force;  

(c) the standard international Customs declaration form shall be printed in two languages, French and the language of the country of dipatch; unless otherwise provided, it shall be made out in duplicate for each country;  

(d) the declaration by the consignor shall be made in Latin characters and in the language of the country of dispatch or in French, and where necessary the railway administration will be responsible for its translation; and  

(e) this regulation does not rule out the possibility for Customs and railway administrations which see fit to do so, to allow the use of other languages in connexion with traffic exclusively concerned with their particular country.     
6.  This standard international Customs declaration form may be modified in accordance with the simplified procedure described in article 16 of this Convention.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####Control facilities

### Article  11  

1.  Passengers using the railway shall enjoy all the Customs privileges granted to passengers crossing the frontier by other means of transport.   
2.  Control officials and agents shall take all necessary steps to prevent a train from being delayed in the event of difficulties or disputes which affect only a small number of the passengers on the train.   

### CHAPTER  V

####Internationaal Verdrag ter vergemakkelijking van de grensoverschrijding van reizigers en bagage, welke per spoor worden vervoerd

De ondergetekenden, behoorlijk gemachtigd, Bijeengekomen te Genève, onder de auspiciën van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, Teneinde de grensoverschrijding van reizigers en bagage, welke per spoor worden vervoerd, te vergemakkelijken,   Hebben omtrent de volgende bepalingen overeenstemming bereikt:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Instelling en régime van grensstations waar de nationale contrôles door twee aangrenzende landen worden uitgevoerd

### Artikel  1  

1.  Voor elke spoorlijn, waarlangs een aanzienlijk aantal internationale reizigers wordt vervoerd en welke de grens tussen twee aangrenzende landen kruist, onderzoeken de bevoegde autoriteiten van die landen, in alle gevallen waarin de contrôles niet op bevredigende wijze in de rijdende treinen kunnen worden uitgevoerd, gezamenlijk de mogelijkheid om in onderling overleg een in de nabijheid van genoemde grens gelegen station aan te wijzen, waar de in de wetgeving van beide landen voorziene contrôles met betrekking tot het binnenkomen en het uitgaan van reizigers en van bagage zullen plaats vinden.   
2.  Indien twee aangrenzende landen verscheidene stations van deze aard langs hun gemeenschappelijke grens aanwijzen, zullen deze stations zoveel mogelijk in gelijk aantal aan elke zijde van genoemde grens zijn gelegen.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Telkens als een station overeenkomstig artikel 1 is aangewezen, wordt een zone vastgesteld, waarbinnen de ambtenaren en beambten van de bevoegde administraties van het land, grenzende aan het grondgebied waarop dat station is gelegen (hierna genoemd: „aangrenzend land”), het recht hebben reizigers, die de grens in de ene of in de andere richting overschrijden, en hun bagage, alsmede met internationale personentreinen vervoerde colli te controleren.   
2.  Deze zone omvat in het algemeen: 

a) een bepaald gedeelte van het station;  

b) de personentreinen en het baanvak, waar deze treinen blijven staan tijdens de gehele duur van de contrôles;  

c) de gedeelten van perrons en spoorlijnen, welke in elk afzonderlijk geval door de bevoegde administraties van de betrokken landen in onderling overleg zijn aangewezen; en  

d) de personentreinen, die zich tussen het station en de grens van het aangrenzende land bevinden.     

### Artikel  3  

De toepassing, binnen de overeenkomstig artikel 2 vastgestelde zone, van de wettelijke en reglementaire bepalingen van het aangrenzende land, alsmede de bevoegdheden, rechten en verplichtingen, welke de ambtenaren en beambten van de bevoegde administraties van dat land in die zone hebben, maken het onderwerp uit van bilaterale overeenkomsten tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken landen.  

### Artikel  4  

1.  De bevoegde administraties van de betrokken landen wijzen bij bijzondere overeenkomsten de ruimten aan, welke voor de diensten van het aangrenzende land binnen genoemde zone nodig zijn, en stellen de voorwaarden vast, waaronder de spoorwegadministratie van het land, op welks grondgebied het station is gelegen, voor bedoelde ruimten zorg draagt voor meubilair, verlichting, verwarming, schoonhouden, telefoonverbindingen, enz.   
2.  De voorwerpen, welke de diensten van het aangrenzende land nodig hebben om hun taak te vervullen, worden tijdelijk ingevoerd en weder uitgevoerd met vrijstelling van alle rechten en heffingen, mits deze voorwerpen op regelmatige wijze worden aangegeven. Bepalingen, welke de invoer of de uitvoer verbieden of beperken, zijn op deze voorwerpen niet van toepassing.   

### Artikel  5  

1.  De ruimten, welke binnen de overeenkomstig artikel 2 vastgestelde zone bestemd zijn voor de diensten van het aangrenzende land, kunnen aan de buitenzijde worden voorzien van een opschrift en een wapenschild met de nationale kleuren van dat land.   
2.  De ambtenaren en beambten van de bevoegde administraties van het aangrenzende land dienen het nationale dienstuniform of het bij de reglementen van dat land voorgeschreven onderscheidingsteken te dragen.   
3.  De ambtenaren en beambten van de bevoegde administraties van het aangrenzende land, die zich voor de uitvoering van de in deze overeenkomst bedoelde contrôles naar het station moeten begeven, zijn vrijgesteld van paspoortformaliteiten. De overlegging van te hunnen name gestelde officiële stukken is voldoende om hun nationaliteit, hun identiteit, hun rang en de aard van hun functie aan te tonen.   
4.  De ambtenaren en beambten, bedoeld in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel, genieten in de uitoefening van hun dienst dezelfde bescherming en bijstand als soortgelijke ambtenaren en beambten van het land op welks grondgebied het station is gelegen.   
5.  Bij de in artikel 3 bedoelde bilaterale overeenkomsten kunnen vrijstellingen van belastingen en heffingen worden verleend aan de ambtenaren en beambten van het aangrenzende land, die verblijven in het land op welks grondgebied het station is gelegen.   
6.  De in artikel 3 bedoelde bilaterale overeenkomsten zullen bepalen: 

a) het maximum aantal ambtenaren en beambten van de bevoegde administraties van het aangrenzende land, dat bevoegd is contrôles in de overeenkomstig artikel 2 vastgestelde zone uit te voeren;  

b) de voorwaarden, waaronder hun terugroeping kan worden gevorderd;  

c) de voorwaarden, waaronder zij wapens mogen dragen en daarvan gebruik mogen maken in de uitoefening van hun dienst binnen genoemde zone.     

### Artikel  6  

1.  Indien doorgaande rijtuigen worden gebruikt, welke van gangen zijn voorzien en bovendien zodanig onderling zijn verbonden dat men zich rechtstreeks van het ene rijtuig naar het andere kan begeven, worden de contrôles in beginsel in de rijtuigen zelf uitgevoerd. De ambtenaren en beambten van de spoorwegen verlenen de nodige hulp, teneinde een doeltreffende en snelle contrôle te verzekeren. Zij verlenen inzonderheid hun medewerking om te voorkomen, dat reizigers, die aan de contrôles zijn onderworpen, de trein verlaten of in de rijtuigen heen en weer lopen, zolang de contrôles niet zijn beëindigd. Bij uitzondering vinden de contrôles plaats in de visitatiezaal van het station, indien de betrokken administratie zulks noodzakelijk acht.   
2.  De contrôles, bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, vinden in beginsel in de onderstaande volgorde plaats: 

a) politiecontrôle van het land van uitgang;  

b) douane- en andere contrôles van het land van uitgang;  

c) politiecontrôle van het land van binnenkomst;  

d) douane- en andere contrôles van het land van binnenkomst.     
3.  De contrôles door de ambtenaren en beambten van het land van binnenkomst kunnen slechts worden uitgevoerd in die gedeelten van de trein, die reeds door de ambtenaren en beambten van het land van uitgang zijn gecontroleerd; laatstgenoemden mogen, behoudens bijzondere bepalingen vervat in de bilaterale overeenkomsten, geen contrôle meer uitoefenen in de gedeelten van de trein, die zij hebben vrijgegeven.   
4.  Voor internationale treinen van normale samenstelling, namelijk van tien tot twaalf rijtuigen, die niet overbezet zijn, dient het oponthoud aan het station, nodig voor de uitvoering van bedoelde contrôles, in beginsel niet langer dan veertig minuten te duren; voor kortere treinen, in het bijzonder voor „autorails”, wordt het oponthoud zoveel mogelijk bekort.   
5.  Met het oog op de uitvoering van de in het vierde lid van dit artikel vervatte bepalingen stellen de spoorwegadministraties de bevoegde autoriteiten van het land van binnenkomst en van het land van uitgang tijdig in kennis van de wijzigingen betreffende de frequentie, de dienstregeling en de samenstelling van de internationale treinen.   

### Artikel  7  

Voorzover op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partijen een deviezencontrôle wordt toegepast, wordt die contrôle uitgevoerd binnen de in artikel 6, vierde lid, bepaalde tijdsduur. De betrokken autoriteiten streven er naar die contrôle op zodanige wijze te organiseren, dat daaruit geen extra ongemak voor de reizigers voortvloeit.  

### Artikel  8  

De Verdragsluitende Partijen leggen ten behoeve van de spoorwegdiensten langs alle belangrijke spoorlijnen rechtstreekse telefoonverbindingen aan tussen de grensstations van de aangrenzende landen en treffen maatregelen om telefoonaansluitingen voor privé-gebruik te vergemakkelijken en te bespoedigen. Het recht tot het aanleggen van rechtstreekse telefoonverbindingen kan bij bilaterale overeenkomst worden uitgebreid tot andere openbare diensten.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Politie- en douanecontrôles in rijdende treinen

### Artikel  9  

1.  Mits zulks doeltreffender en tevens voor de reizigers gunstiger blijkt te zijn, worden de politie- en douanecontrôles zoveel mogelijk in rijdende internationale treinen uitgevoerd: 

a) in alle gevallen waarin het traject, dat die treinen, hetzij vóór, hetzij na het grensstation van één van de beide aangrenzende landen, zonder te stoppen afleggen, op dat grondgebied voldoende tijd biedt voor het vervullen van de voor deze contrôles vereiste formaliteiten; en  

b) onder voorwaarde, dat de contrôles in de rijdende treinen tot gevolg hebben, dat het oponthoud van die treinen, hetzij in de grensstations, hetzij in het station waar de contrôles door twee aangrenzende landen worden uitgevoerd, aanmerkelijk wordt bekort.     
2.  Indien het ter bespoediging van de contrôlewerkzaamheden of ter vermijding van het stoppen aan de grenzen noodzakelijk wordt geacht de ambtenaren en beambten van één van de aangrenzende landen te machtigen om de internationale treinen op het grondgebied van het andere aangrenzende land te betreden en in die treinen op het gebied van dat land contrôles uit te voeren, stellen de bevoegde autoriteiten van die landen bij bilaterale overeenkomst de voorwaarden vast, waaronder die werkzaamheden worden verricht.   
3.  In internationale treinen vindt de contrôle van de ingeschreven bagage, voorzover deze bagage niet wordt vervoerd onder het in artikel 10 bedoelde régime voor internationale doorvoer, zoveel mogelijk tijdens het rijden plaats, mits zodanige contrôle voordelen biedt voor de reizigers, die dergelijke bagage met zich voeren.   
4.  De wijze van toepassing van de bepalingen van dit artikel maakt het onderwerp uit van regelingen tussen de bevoegde administraties van de Verdragsluitende Partijen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Internationaal vervoer onder douanerégime van bagage en colli, welke in de internationale personentreinen zijn toegelaten

### Artikel  10  

1.  Teneinde in beginsel het onderzoek te vermijden van ingeschreven bagage, toebehorende aan reizigers, die zich op doorreis op het grondgebied van een land bevinden, alsmede van colli, welke met internationale personentreinen worden doorgevoerd, treffen de douane-administraties en de andere betrokken administraties van de Verdragsluitende Partijen in overleg met de spoorwegadministraties van die landen bijzondere maatregelen, zoals het verzegelen van goederenwagons of gedeelten daarvan, van containers, manden of zakken, waarin zodanige bagage wordt vervoerd, of het verzegelen van de colli zelf, mits vooraf een internationale douaneverklaring is opgemaakt.   
2.  In overleg met de spoorwegadministraties van de betrokken landen vestigen de douane-administraties en de andere betrokken administraties van die landen, voorzoveel mogelijk, kantoren in de in het binnenland gelegen stations, waar het internationale verkeer bijzonder belangrijk is, teneinde de douanebehandeling en de andere contrôles van ingeschreven bagage en van colli, welke met personentreinen worden vervoerd, mogelijk te maken, hetzij vóór het vertrek uit die stations, hetzij na de aankomst in genoemde stations. Het vervoer van die bagage en colli, hetzij van één van die in het binnenland gelegen stations naar het grensstation of in omgekeerde richting, hetzij tussen twee aan weerszijden van de grens in het binnenland gelegen stations, kan plaats vinden onder het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde régime voor internationale doorvoer.   
3.  De spoorwegadministraties streven er naar de douanebehandeling en de andere contrôles van ingeschreven bagage en van door internationale personentreinen vervoerde colli zoveel mogelijk te doen plaats hebben vóór de inlading op het station van afzending.   
4.  Indien de douanebehandeling en de andere contrôles van de colli niet op de grensstations kunnen worden verricht binnen de in artikel 6, vierde lid, bepaalde tijdsduur, worden zij uitgeladen en zal de trein niet extra worden opgehouden.   
5.  Voor de toepassing van dit hoofdstuk gelden de volgende bepalingen: 

a) de Verdragsluitende Partijen erkennen in beginsel de douaneverzegelingen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, behoudens de bevoegdheid van elke douane-administratie om haar eigen verzegeling aan te brengen, indien zij zulks noodzakelijk acht;  

b) voorzover niet een eenvoudiger systeem van kracht is, aanvaarden de Verdragsluitende Partijen het bij deze overeenkomst behorende model van een internationale douaneverklaring;  

c) de internationale douaneverklaring wordt in twee talen gedrukt, te weten in de Franse taal en in de taal van het land van verzending; voorzover niet anders is bepaald, wordt deze verklaring voor elk land in tweevoud opgemaakt;  

d) de verklaring wordt door de afzender ingevuld in Latijns schrift en in de taal van het land van verzending of wel in de Franse taal, met dien verstande dat de spoorwegadministratie, zo nodig, voor een vertaling daarvan dient zorg te dragen; en  

e) deze regeling sluit voor de douane- en de spoorwegadministraties, die zulks wenselijk achten, de mogelijkheid niet uit om met betrekking tot vervoer, dat uitsluitend hun eigen landen betreft, het gebruik van andere talen toe te staan.     
6.  Dit model van een internationale douaneverklaring kan worden gewijzigd volgens de vereenvoudigde procedure, bedoeld in artikel 16 van deze overeenkomst.   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Contrôlefaciliteiten

### Artikel  11  

1.  Personen, die per trein reizen, genieten dezelfde douanefaciliteiten als reizigers, die de grens met andere vervoermiddelen overschrijden.   
2.  De ambtenaren en beambten, belast met de contrôle, treffen alle nodige maatregelen om te voorkomen dat een trein wordt opgehouden in geval van moeilijkheden of geschillen, welke slechts een gering aantal reizigers van die trein betreffen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  12  

1.  Nadat dit Verdrag heden is ondertekend kunnen de landen, die deelnemen aan de werkzaamheden van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, tot dit Verdrag toetreden.

### Artikel  14  

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking wanneer drie van de landen, bedoeld in artikel 12, eerste lid, Partij bij dit Verdrag zijn geworden.   
2.  Dit Verdrag houdt op van kracht te zijn, indien te eniger tijd het aantal Verdragsluitende Partijen minder dan drie bedraagt.   

### Artikel  15  

Elk geschil tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen nopens de interpretatie of de toepassing van dit Verdrag, hetwelk de Partijen niet door middel van onderhandelingen of op een andere wijze hebben kunnen regelen, kan op verzoek van één van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan een scheidsrechterlijke commissie, voor welke commissie iedere partij in het geschil één lid zal aanwijzen, en waarvan de voorzitter, die een beslissende stem zal hebben, zal worden benoemd door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  16  

1.  Indien één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen het wenselijk oordeelt dat wijzigingen worden aangebracht in het bij dit Verdrag behorende model van een internationale douaneverklaring, doet zij haar voorstel tot wijziging toekomen aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die de tekst daarvan ter kennis zal brengen van alle landen, welke dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend of tot dit Verdrag zijn toegetreden.   
2.  De wijziging wordt geacht van kracht te worden negentig dagen na de datum van de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde kennisgeving, tenzij vóór het verstrijken van die termijn ten minste één derde van het aantal landen, welke dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend of tot dit Verdrag zijn toegetreden, aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties hebben doen weten, dat zij tegen de wijziging bezwaar hebben.
