### Article  VIII  

####Safety Standards, Certificates and Licences

1.  Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences, issued or rendered valid by the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party and still in force, shall be recognized as valid by the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of operating the agreed services provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, the standards established under the Convention. The aeronautical authorities of each Contracting Party reserve the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flights above its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by the other Contracting Party.   
2.  If the privileges or conditions of the licences or certificates referred to in paragraph 1 above, issued by the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party to any person or designated airline or in respect of an aircraft used in the operation of the agreed services, should permit a difference from the standards established under the Convention, and which difference has been filed with the International Civil Aviation Organization, the other Contracting Party may request consultations between the aeronautical authorities in conformity with Article XXI of this Agreement with a view to clarifying the practice in question.   
3.  Consultations concerning the safety standards and requirements maintained and administered by the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party relating to aeronautical facilities, aircrew, aircraft, and operation of the designated airlines shall be held within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a request from either Contracting Party.

Failure to take appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time shall constitute grounds for withholding, revoking, suspending or imposing conditions on the authorizations of the airline or airlines designated by the other Contracting Party.   
4.  When immediate action is essential to the safety of airline operations, the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party may withhold, revoke, suspend or impose conditions on the authorizations of the airline or airlines designated by the other Contracting Party.   

### Article  IX  

####Aviation Security

1.  Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties reaffirm that their obligation to each other to protect the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference forms an integral part of this Agreement.   
2.  Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall in particular act in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on September 14, 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on December 16, 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on September 23, 1971, and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988 and any other multilateral agreement governing aviation security binding upon both Contracting Parties.   
3.  The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.   
4.  The Contracting Parties shall act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization and designated as Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties; they shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators of aircraft who have their principle place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions. Accordingly, each Contracting Party shall advise the other Contracting Party of any difference between its national regulations and practices and the aviation security standards of the Annexes referred to in this paragraph. Either Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party at any time to discuss any such differences.   
5.  Each Contracting Party agrees that its operators of aircraft may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 4 above required by the other Contracting Party for entry into, departure from, or while within the territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that adequate measures are effectively applied within its territory to protect the aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew, carry-on items, baggage, cargo, mail and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding and loading.   
6.  Each Contracting Party shall, as far as may be practicable, meet any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
7.  Each Contracting Party shall have the right, within sixty (60) days following notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed between the aeronautical authorities), to conduct an assessment in the territory of the other Contracting Party of the security measures being carried out, or planned to be carried out, by aircraft operators in respect of flights arriving from, or departing to the territory of the first Contracting Party. The administrative arrangements for the conduct of such assessments shall be agreed between the aeronautical authorities and implemented without delay so as to ensure that assessments will be conducted expeditiously.   
8.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and taking other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.   
9.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may request consultations. Such consultations shall start within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such a request from either Contracting Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the start of consultations shall constitute grounds for withholding, revoking, suspending or imposing conditions on the authorizations of the airline or airlines designated by the other Contracting Party. When justified by an emergency, or to prevent further non-compliance with the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may take interim action at any time.   

### Article  X  

####Use of Airports and Aviation Facilities

1.  Airports, airways, air traffic control and air navigation services, aviation security, and other related facilities and services that are provided in the territory of one Contracting Party shall be available for use by the airlines of the other Contracting Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any airline engaged in similar international air services at the time arrangements for use are made.   
2.  The setting and collection of fees and charges imposed in the territory of one Contracting Party on an airline of the other Contracting Party for the use of airports, airways, air traffic control and air navigation services, aviation security, and other related facilities and services shall be just and reasonable. Any such fees and charges shall be assessed on an airline of the other Contracting Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any airline engaged in similar international air services at the time the fees or charges are imposed.   
3.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage discussions between its competent charging authorities and the airlines using the services and facilities, or where practicable, through airlines' representative organizations. Reasonable notice shall be given to users of any proposals for changes in user charges to enable them to express their views before changes are made.   

### Article  XI  

####Capacity

1.  There shall be fair and equal opportunity for the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties to operate the agreed services on the specified routes.   
2.  In operating the agreed services, the designated airlines of each Contracting Party shall take into account the interest of the designated airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provide on the whole or part of the same routes.   
3.  The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall bear reasonable relationship to the requirements of the public for transportation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of capacity adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers and cargo, including mail, between the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline and the countries of ultimate destination of the traffic.   
4.  Provision for the carriage of passengers and cargo, including mail, both taken up and discharged at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating the airline shall be made in accordance with the general principle that capacity shall be related to: 

a) traffic requirements to and from the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline;  

b) traffic requirements of the area through which the airline passes after taking account of other transport services established by airlines of the States comprising the area; and  

c) the requirements of through airline operation.

2.  The exemptions granted by this Article shall apply to the items referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article: 

a) introduced into the territory of one Contracting Party by or on behalf of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party;  

b) retained on board aircraft of a designated airline of one Contracting Party upon arriving in or leaving the territory of the other Contracting Party; and

The regular airborne equipment, as well as the materials and supplies normally retained on board the aircraft of a designated airline of either Contracting Party, may be unloaded in the territory of the other Contracting Party only with the approval of the Customs authorities of that territory. In such case, they may be placed under the supervision of the said authorities up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Customs regulations.   
4.  Baggage and cargo in direct transit across the territory of either Contracting Party shall be exempt from customs duties and other similar charges.   

### Article  XIV  

####Tariffs

1.  For the purpose of this Article, 

a) ``Price" means any fare, rate or charge contained in tariffs (including frequent flyer plans or other benefits provided in association with air transportation) for the carriage of passengers (including their baggage) and/or cargo (excluding mail) on scheduled air services and the conditions directly governing the availability or applicability of such fare, rate or charge but excluding general terms and conditions of carriage;  

b) ``General Terms and Conditions of Carriage" means those terms and conditions contained in tariffs which are broadly applicable to air transportation and not directly related to any price; and  

c) the term ``match" means the continuation or introduction, on a timely basis, of an identical or similar (but not lower) price.     
2.  Prices for carriage by the designated airline or airlines of one Contracting Party to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be established at reasonable levels due regard being paid to all relevant factors including the interests of users, cost of operation, characteristics of service, reasonable profit, prices of other airlines and other commercial considerations in the marketplace.   
3.  The prices referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article may be developed individually or, at the option of the designated airline or airlines, through coordination with each other or with other airlines. A designated airline shall be responsible only to its own aeronautical authorities for the justification of its prices.   
4.  Each Contracting Party may require the filing with its aeronautical authorities by the designated airline or airlines of their prices for carriage between the territories of the Contracting Parties. Such filing, if required, shall be received by the aeronautical authorities at least one (1) day before the proposed effective date. Upon filing of the proposed prices, the designated airline shall be permitted to sell transportation on the agreed services at the filed price provided that all sales are for transportation commencing not earlier than the proposed effective date. A designated airline which has established a price individually shall, at the time of filing, ensure that the filed price is accessible to other designated airlines.   
5.  If the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party are dissatisfied with an existing or proposed price for carriage between the territories of the Contracting Parties, they shall so notify the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party and the airline offering the price. Unless the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party agree that an existing or proposed price is inconsistent with the principles of this Article, the price shall come into effect or continue in effect.   
6.  With respect to carriage between the territories of the Contracting Parties, the airline or airlines of each Contracting Party shall have the right to match on a basis which would not be necessarily identical but would be broadly equivalent, any publicly available lawful price on scheduled services as well as retail prices charged on charter services. Prices which qualify as matching may be filed on not less than one day's notice.   
7.  Each Contracting Party may require the filing of prices for carriage between its territory and third countries in accordance with the regulations of its aeronautical authorities. If filing is required, the designated airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party shall not be required to file such prices on any greater period of notice prior to the proposed effective date than that normally applicable to the airline or airlines of the Contracting Party requiring the filing, subject to a minimum of ten (10) days' notice, unless otherwise authorized by the aeronautical authorities.   
8.  The price to be applied by a designated airline of one Contracting Party for carriage between the territory of the other Contracting Party and a third country shall not come into effect or remain in effect if the aeronautical authorities of that other Contracting Party are dissatisfied with it. In this regard, the price to be applied by a designated airline of one Contracting Party shall not be lower than the lowest price charged for scheduled international air services by the airline(s) of the other Contracting Party in that market, unless otherwise authorized by the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party.   
9.  Subject to paragraph 8 of this Article, any designated airline of each Contracting Party shall have the right to match any publicly available lawful price on scheduled services between the territory of the other Contracting Party and any third country. Prices which qualify as matching may be filed on not less than one day's notice. The aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party may require the designated airline proposing the price to provide satisfactory evidence of the availability of the price being matched.   
10.  The aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party may request discussions on prices at any time. Such discussions, which may be conducted orally or in writing, shall be held within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed between the aeronautical authorities.   
11.  When prices have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Article, those prices shall remain in force until new prices have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Nevertheless, a price shall not be prolonged by virtue of this paragraph for more than twelve (12) months after the date on which it would otherwise have expired.   
12.  Each Contracting Party may require the filing with its aeronautical authorities by the designated airline or airlines of their general terms and conditions of carriage in accordance with its national laws and regulations. Acceptance or approval of such terms and conditions shall be subject to national laws and regulations. The aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party may at any time withdraw such acceptance or approval upon not less than fifteen (15) days notice to the designated airlines concerned and the term or condition shall cease to have any force or effect thereafter.   

### Article  XV  

####Sales and Transfer of Funds

1.  Each designated airline shall have the right to engage in the sale of air transportation in the territory of the other Contracting Party directly and, at its discretion through its agents.

Any constraints shall be applied uniformly and on terms no less favourable than the most favour-able terms available to any airline engaged in similar international air services at the time the constraints are imposed.   

### Article  XIX  

####Smoking Ban

1.  Each Contracting Party shall prohibit or cause their airlines to prohibit smoking on all flights carrying passengers operated by its airlines between the territories of the Contracting Parties.
