### Protocol  

####between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Cayman Islands as authorised under the letter of entrustment from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the interpretation and application of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Cayman Islands as authorised under the letter of entrustment from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the exchange of information with respect to taxes

Whereas the Government of the Netherlands recognises the commitment the Government of the Cayman Islands made to the OECD in 2000 to respect the principles of transparency and exchange of information and the Netherlands considers that this Agreement demonstrates the commitment of the Cayman Islands to high standards for effective exchange of information with respect to both criminal and civil taxation matters; Whereas the Government of the Netherlands also recognises the progressive steps that the Cayman Islands have taken to demonstrate their commitment to high standards for effective exchange of information with respect to both criminal and civil taxation matters in negotiation of Tax Information Exchange Agreements with other countries and recognises that the Cayman Islands are committed to combating tax abuse by putting in place mechanisms which enhance transparency; for example, the proactive steps taken to amend domestic legislation of the Cayman Islands for the purpose of fulfilling this Agreement and upon entering into the Agreement, the Netherlands does not consider the Cayman Islands to be engaging in any harmful tax practices and thus is not referred to as a tax haven. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Cayman Islands (the “Parties”), Desiring to facilitate the exchange of information with respect to taxes,   Have agreed as follows:    

### I  

####Ad Article 5(5)(g) 

With respect to subparagraph g of paragraph 5 of Article 5 it is understood that the term “pursued all means available in its own territory” includes the requesting Party using exchange of information mechanisms it has in force with any third country in which the information is located.  

### II  

####Ad Article 5 

If personal data is exchanged under the Agreement, the following additional provisions shall apply: 

a) The receiving authority may use such data only for the stated purpose and shall be subject to the conditions prescribed by the supplying authority; such use is also permitted, subject to the written consent required under Article 8, for the prevention and prosecution of serious crimes and for the purpose of addressing serious threats to public security;  

b) The receiving authority shall on request inform the supplying authority about the use of the supplied data and the results achieved thereby;  

c) Personal data may be supplied only to the responsible agencies. Any subsequent supply to other agencies may be effected only with the prior approval of the supplying authority;  

d) The supplying authority shall be obliged to take all reasonable care to ensure that the data to be supplied are accurate and that they are necessary for and proportionate to the purpose for which they are supplied. Any bans on data supply prescribed under applicable domestic law shall be observed. If it emerges that inaccurate data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied, the receiving authority shall be informed of this without delay. That authority shall be obliged to correct or erase such data without delay;  

e) Upon application the person concerned shall be informed of the supplied data relating to him and of the use to which such data are to be put. There shall be no obligation to furnish this information if on balance it turns out that the public interest in withholding it outweighs the interest of the person concerned in receiving it. In all other respects, the right of the person concerned to be informed of the existing data relating to him shall be governed by the domestic law of the Party in whose sovereign territory the application for the information is made;  

f) The receiving authority shall bear liability in accordance with its domestic laws in relation to any person suffering unlawful damage as a result of supply of data pursuant to this Agreement. In relation to the damaged person, the receiving authority may not plead in its defence that the damage had been caused by the supplying agency;  

g) If the domestic law of the supplying authority provided, with respect to the personal data supplied, for erasure within a certain period of time that authority shall inform the receiving authority accordingly. Irrespective of such periods, supplied personal data shall be erased once they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were supplied;  

h) The supplying and the receiving authority shall be obliged to keep official records of the supply and receipt of personal data;  

i) The supplying and the receiving authority shall be obliged to take effective measures to protect the personal data supplied against unauthorised access, unauthorised alteration and unauthorised disclosure.    

### III  

####Ad article 11 

In the event that a Party applies prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices to residents or nationals of the other Party, either Party may immediately initiate Competent Authority proceedings to resolve the matter. A prejudicial or restrictive measure based on harmful tax practices is a measure applied by one Party to residents or nationals of either Party on the basis that any one or more of the following applies: 

a) the other Party does not engage in effective exchange of information;  

b) because it lacks transparency in the operation of its laws, regulations or administrative practices; or,  

c) on the basis of no or nominal taxes.   Without limiting the generality of the term, “prejudicial or restrictive measure” is not limited solely to taxation matters and includes the denial of a deduction, credit or exemption, the imposition of a tax, charge or levy, or special reporting requirements, but does not include any generally applicable measure, applied by either Party against, amongst others, members of the OECD generally.  

### IV  

In the light of the experience of operating the Agreement, or to reflect changing circumstances, either Government may wish to propose a variation in the terms of this Agreement. If so, it is understood the other Government will agree to hold timely discussions with a view to revising the terms of the Agreement. 

a) The competent authorities may initiate discussions in case: 

(i) the Netherlands enters into an agreement with another jurisdiction comparable to the Cayman Islands which provides for other forms of exchange of information;  

(ii) the Government of the Cayman Islands enters into an agreement with another jurisdiction which provides for other forms of exchange of information;  

(iii) the Government of the Cayman Islands introduces new legislation which enables other forms of exchange of information.    

b) If the Netherlands enters into arrangements with another jurisdiction comparable to the Cayman Islands for the provision of information with respect to taxes that are less burdensome in any material respect than the provisions of the Agreement, the Cayman Islands may initiate discussions with the Netherlands with a view to modifying the Agreement to have similar effect.   This Protocol shall form an integral part of the Agreement between the Kingdom of The Netherlands and the Government of the Cayman Islands as authorised under the letter of entrustment from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the exchange of information with respect to tax matters. The Parties may, by mutual arrangement, amend this Protocol at any time in writing. The amended Protocol will come into effect on the date of the final letter arranging the amendment.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised in that behalf by the respective Parties, have signed this Protocol. DONE at The Hague, this 8 <sup>th</sup> day of July 2009, in duplicate in the English language. For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, J. K.

3.  De aangezochte partij kan een verzoek om informatie afwijzen indien openbaarmaking van de informatie in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.   
4.  Een verzoek om informatie wordt niet geweigerd op grond van het feit dat de belastingvordering die aanleiding gaf tot het verzoek wordt betwist.   
5.  De aangezochte partij kan een verzoek om informatie afwijzen indien de informatie door de verzoekende partij wordt gevraagd om een bepaling van de belastingwetgeving van de verzoekende partij toe te passen of te handhaven die, of een daarmee verband houdend vereiste dat, discriminatie inhoudt van een onderdaan van de aangezochte partij ten opzichte van een onderdaan van de verzoekende partij die zich in dezelfde omstandigheden bevindt.   

### Artikel  8  

####Vertrouwelijkheid

####Protocol tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Caymaneilanden zoals gemachtigd krachtens de volmacht van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittanië en Noord-Ierland betreffende de uitlegging en toepassing van het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Caymaneilanden zoals gemachtigd krachtens de volmacht van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittanië en Noord-Ierland inzake de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen

Overwegend dat de Regering van Nederland erkent dat de Regering van de Caymaneilanden zich jegens de OESO in 2000 verplicht heeft de beginselen van transparantie en de uitwisseling van informatie te eerbiedigen en Nederland meent dat dit Verdrag aantoont dat de Caymaneilanden bereid zijn strenge normen te hanteren voor de doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie ter zake van zowel strafrechtelijke als civielrechtelijke fiscale aangelegenheden; Overwegend dat de Regering van Nederland voorts de geleidelijke maatregelen erkent die de Caymaneilanden hebben genomen als blijk van hun bereidheid tot het hanteren van strenge normen voor de doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie ter zake van zowel strafrechtelijke als civielrechtelijke fiscale aangelegenheden bij het onderhandelen over verdragen tot uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen met andere landen en erkent dat de Caymaneilanden zich hebben verplicht belastingfraude te bestrijden door mechanismen in werking te stellen ter bevordering van de transparantie, waaronder de proactieve maatregelen die zijn genomen tot aanpassing van de nationale wetgeving van de Caymaneilanden teneinde aan dit Verdrag te voldoen; bij het sluiten van het Verdrag meent het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden dat de Caymaneilanden niet betrokken zijn bij schadelijke fiscale praktijken en derhalve niet worden aangemerkt als een belastingparadijs; De Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, en de Regering van de Caymaneilanden („de partijen”), Geleid door de wens de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen te vergemakkelijken,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### I  

####Ad artikel 5, vijfde lid, onderdeel g 

Wat artikel 5, vijfde lid, onderdeel g, betreft is het wel te verstaan dat onder de uitdrukking „op haar eigen grondgebied alles in het werk heeft gesteld” mede wordt begrepen dat de verzoekende partij gebruikmaakt van de mechanismen voor de uitwisseling van informatie die van kracht zijn met derde landen waar de informatie zich bevindt.  

### II  

####Ad artikel 5 

Indien uit hoofde van het Verdrag persoonsgegevens worden uitgewisseld zijn de volgende aanvullende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a. De ontvangende autoriteit mag dergelijke gegevens uitsluitend gebruiken voor het opgegeven doel en wel onder de door de verstrekkende autoriteit vereiste voorwaarden; dergelijk gebruik is eveneens toegestaan na de ingevolge artikel 8 vereiste schriftelijke toestemming ter voorkoming en vervolging van ernstige delicten en ten behoeve van de bestrijding van ernstige bedreigingen voor de openbare veiligheid;  

b. Op verzoek stelt de ontvangende autoriteit de verstrekkende autoriteit in kennis van het gebruik van de verstrekte gegevens en de resultaten die ermee bereikt zijn;  

c. Persoonsgegevens mogen uitsluitend aan de verantwoordelijke instanties worden verstrekt. Persoonsgegevens mogen uitsluitend aan andere instanties worden doorgegeven na voorafgaande toestemming van de verstrekkende autoriteit;  

d. De verstrekkende autoriteit is verplicht alle redelijke zorg te betrachten om te waarborgen dat de te verstrekken gegevens correct zijn, nodig zijn voor en in verhouding staan tot het doel waarvoor zij worden verstrekt. Alle verboden ter zake van de verstrekking van gegevens krachtens de van toepassing zijnde nationale wetgeving dienen te worden geëerbiedigd. Indien blijkt dat onjuiste gegevens zijn verstrekt of dat er gegevens zijn verstrekt die niet verstrekt hadden mogen worden, dient de ontvangende autoriteit hiervan overwijld in kennis te worden gesteld. De ontvangende autoriteit is verplicht dergelijke gegevens onverwijld te corrigeren of te vernietigen;  

e. Op aanvraag wordt de betrokken persoon geïnformeerd over de verstrekte gegevens die op hem betrekking hebben en over het doel waarvoor zij worden verstrekt. Deze informatie behoeft niet te worden verstrekt indien na afweging blijkt dat het openbaar belang bij niet-verstrekken zwaarder weegt dan het belang dat betrokken persoon heeft bij het ontvangen ervan. In alle overige opzichten is op het recht van betrokken persoon te worden geïnformeerd over de bestaande gegevens over hem het nationale recht van toepassing van de staat op wier soevereine grondgebied de aanvraag om informatie wordt gedaan;  

f. De ontvangende autoriteit is in overeenstemming met zijn nationale recht aansprakelijk jegens elke persoon die wederrechtelijk schade lijdt ten gevolge van het verstrekken van gegevens uit hoofde van dit Verdrag. Jegens de persoon die schade heeft geleden mag de ontvangende autoriteit ter verdediging niet aanvoeren dat de schade is veroorzaakt door de verstrekkende instantie;  

g. Indien het nationale recht van de verstrekkende autoriteit ter zake van de verstrekte persoonsgegevens voorziet in vernietiging binnen een bepaalde termijn, dient zij de ontvangende autoriteit daarvan op de hoogte te stellen. Ongeacht dergelijke termijnen dienen verstrekte persoonsgegevens te worden vernietigd zodra zij niet langer nodig zijn voor het doel waarvoor zij zijn verstrekt;  

h. De verstrekkende en de ontvangende autoriteit zijn verplicht het verstrekken en ontvangen van persoonsgegevens officieel te registreren;  

i. De verstrekkende en de ontvangende autoriteit zijn verplicht doeltreffende maatregelen te nemen ter bescherming van verstrekte persoonsgegevens tegen toegang of wijziging door en bekendmaking aan onbevoegden.    

### III  

####Ad artikel 11 

1.  Indien een partij vanwege schadelijke fiscale praktijken nadelige of beperkende maatregelen toepast op inwoners of onderdanen van de andere partij, kunnen beide partijen onverwijld een procedure voor onderling overleg starten ten behoeve van een oplossing. Een nadelige of beperkende maatregel vanwege schadelijke fiscale praktijken is een maatregel die de ene partij toepast op inwoners of onderdanen van diezelfde danwel andere partij waarbij het volgende geldt: 

a. de andere partij neemt geen deel aan een doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie;  

b. er is sprake van een gebrek aan transparantie bij de uitvoering van haar wet- of regelgeving of bestuursrechtelijke praktijken; of  

c. de maatregel wordt zonder belastinggrondslag of op grond van minieme belastingen genomen.   Zonder het algemene karakter van de uitdrukking te beperken is de uitdrukking „nadelige of beperkende maatregel” niet alleen beperkt tot fiscale aangelegenheden en omvat zij mede het weigeren van aftrek, verrekening of vrijstelling, het opleggen van een belasting of heffing, of bijzondere rapportagevereisten; zij omvat niet de algemeen toepasselijke maatregelen die door een van de partijen in het algemeen worden opgelegd aan onder meer leden van de OESO.   

### IV  

Op grond van ervaringen met de werking van het Verdrag of van veranderende omstandigheden kan elk van de regeringen een aanpassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag voorstellen. Indien zulks het geval is, is het wel te verstaan dat de andere regering instemt met tijdig overleg teneinde de bepalingen van het Verdrag te herzien. 

a. De bevoegde autoriteiten kunnen in overleg treden indien: 

i. Nederland een verdrag sluit met een andere, met de Caymaneilanden vergelijkbare, mogendheid dat voorziet in andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie;  

ii. de Regering van de Caymaneilanden een verdrag sluit met een andere mogendheid dat voorziet in andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie;  

iii. de Regering van de Caymaneilanden nieuwe wetgeving invoert die andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie mogelijk maakt.    

b. Indien Nederland met een andere, met de Caymaneilanden vergelijkbare, mogendheid regelingen treft voor het verstrekken van informatie ter zake van belastingen die in materieel opzicht minder belastend zijn dan de bepalingen van het Verdrag, kunnen de Caymaneilanden met Nederland in overleg treden teneinde het Verdrag dienovereenkomstig aan te passen.   Dit Protocol vormt een integrerend onderdeel van het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Caymaneilanden zoals gemachtigd krachtens de volmacht van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland inzake de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen. De partijen kunnen dit Protocol te allen tijde in onderling overleg schriftelijk wijzigen. Het gewijzigde Protocol treedt in werking op de datum van de definitieve brief waarin de wijziging geregeld wordt.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekenden , daartoe naar behoren gemachtigd door de onderscheiden partijen, dit Protocol hebben ondertekend. <sup> 2)  [Red: In *Trb.*  2009, 119 is ten onrechte als ondertekenaar J.
