With respect to article 13, paragraph 5, it is the understanding of the Parties that that this paragraph extends to communications between Tribunal offices, installations, facilities and means of transport, within and outside the host State, in particular with Tribunal offices in Lebanon and the United States of America. With respect to article 15 it is the understanding of the Parties that the value-added tax paid in respect of goods supplied or services rendered to the Tribunal will be refunded to the Tribunal on application. The tax on hydrocarbons such as fuel oil and motor fuels which the Tribunal requires for official purposes will be refunded to the Tribunal on application. The Tribunal will be exempted at the time of purchase from excise duties on goods supplied and required for official purposes, purchased from a ‘accijnsgoederenplaats’, if a permit thereto is acquired from the national tax Authority. The Tribunal will submit applications for reimbursement within three months after the quarter of the calendar year during which payment was made for goods supplied or services rendered and will send the relevant documents together with the applications to the national tax authority. The Tribunal undertakes to facilitate the verification by the competent authorities of the facts on which the tax exemption or tax refund can be based. Reimbursement of the above-mentioned taxes and duties will be done in conformity with the applicable tax regulations and quotas set by the Government. In addition, both Parties understand the reference to “general principles” in article 15, paragraph 3, to refer back to the exemptions provided for in article 15, paragraph 2. It is the understanding of the Parties that during their term of office, the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, and staff are exempted from taxation in the host State under article 17, paragraphs 1 and 2, and article 18, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. Article 17, paragraph 3, and article 18, paragraph 4, specify that periods during which these persons are present in the host State for the discharge of their functions “shall not be considered as periods of residence”. These two provisions are not designed to create tax exemptions in addition to the exemptions under article 17, paragraphs 1 and 2, and article 18, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. They clarify that, in situations where the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar or staff maintain residence in the host State after the expiry of their term of office, no taxes will be due in relation to exemptions which were applicable during the period in which these persons held office. With respect to article 17, paragraph 4, according to which the “host State shall not be obliged to exempt from income tax pensions or annuities paid to former judges, Prosecutors, Deputy Prosecutors, and Registrars and their members of the family forming part of their household”, it is understood by both Parties that former judges, Prosecutors, Deputy Prosecutors, and Registrars and their members of the family forming part of their household would only be subject to taxation by the host State if, upon expiry of their respective terms of office, they reside in the territory of the host State or are nationals of the host State. This explanation also applies, *mutatis mutandis*, to article 18, paragraph 5, which contains a provision similar to article 17, paragraph 4, with respect to former staff and their members of the family forming part of their household. It is the understanding of the Parties that article 19, paragraph 2, concerns the internal rules and regulations of the Tribunal and that these rules and regulations do not concern the granting of privileges and immunities by the host State to personnel referred to in article 19. It is the understanding of the Parties that a procedure will be drawn up by the Registrar in which it will be ensured that the document mentioned in article 23, paragraph 2, will be handed over to the witness as soon as possible, at the latest upon arrival in the host State. Both Parties understand that article 24 applies also to victims participating in proceedings for reparation. It is the understanding of the Parties that if the Tribunal makes use of gratis personnel, this personnel will be considered experts under article 25. With respect to article 28, it is the understanding of the Parties that Representatives of States participating in meetings of the Management Committee are, while exercising their functions and during the journey to and from the host State, to be regarded as falling within the ambit of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 13 February 1946 and that their privileges and immunities will be waived in accordance with Section 14 of the Convention. With respect to article 32, it is the understanding of the Parties that the social security regime will be established in consultation with the competent authorities of the host State. With respect to article 35, both Parties understand that visas will be issued in accordance with the laws of the host State. It is also the understanding of both Parties that in exceptional cases, such as where the applicant is unable to pay, visas for visitors who are family members of a detained person, will, at the discretion of the competent authorities of the host State, be issued free of charge or for a reduced fee. With respect to article 39, paragraph 6, it is the understanding of both Parties that this paragraph ensures that the transport of persons in custody of the Tribunal for purposes of the Tribunal will not be delayed by any impediment, such as the immigration and asylum procedures of the host State. The asylum law and procedures of the host State require that asylum seekers apply for asylum in person at an asylum seeker centre within the host State. As this procedure would hamper the immediate transport of the person for purposes of the Tribunal, its application would be undesirable in this context. It is understood that paragraph 6 does not deny a person in custody of the Tribunal the ability to apply for asylum or another legal basis to remain in the Netherlands under the laws of the host State at a time other than during transport. The term “transport” in this article refers to the transportation of a person within the territory of the host State. The term “transfer” in this article refers to the transportation of a person from one State to another. Article 42 addresses the issue of provisional release. Both Parties decided to regulate in this Agreement only those aspects relating to provisional release into a State other than the host State. This is reflected in the language of article 42, paragraph 1. The Agreement does not address the conditions and modalities of provisional release into the host State, because provisional release into the host State is not foreseen. Article 42, paragraph 2, governs the re-entry into the host State of persons granted provisional release. The practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has shown that there may be situations in which persons granted provisional release may need to return to the host State for purposes related to proceedings before the Tribunal. Paragraph 2 clarifies that the host State will facilitate the transfer of such persons. The host State has entered into an arrangement to that effect with the ICTY, by way of an exchange of letters of December 2003, which governs “short-term stays on Dutch soil” of persons granted provisional release by the ICTY. Paragraph 3 of this article provides a basis for both Parties to conclude such and other types of practical arrangements concerning the implementation of article 42. Without prejudice to the rules and regulations of the Tribunal, it is the understanding of the Parties that the following persons will, for the purposes of this Agreement, and this Agreement only, be considered as members of the family forming part of the household of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, the Head of the Defence Office and staff: 

a) pouses of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, the Head of the Defence Office and staff;  

b) children of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, the Head of the Defence Office and staff who are under the age of 18;  

c) children of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, the Head of the Defence Office and staff aged 18 or over, but not older than 27, provided that they formed part of the household prior to their first entry into the host State and still form part of this household, and that they are unmarried, financially dependent on the judge, Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor, Registrar, Head of the Defence Office or member of the staff of the Tribunal concerned and are attending full time education in the host State;  

d) children of judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar, the Head of the Defence Office and staff who are aged 18 or over, but not older than 23, will also be recognized as members of the family forming part of the household if they are not studying as long as they are unmarried and financially dependent on the judge, Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor, Registrar, Head of the Defence Office or member of the staff of the Tribunal concerned;  

e) other persons who, in exceptional cases or for humanitarian reasons, the Tribunal and the host State decide to treat as members of the family forming part of the household.   It is the understanding of the Parties that any issues arising from the foregoing understanding will be resolved by the Registrar and the competent authorities of the host State on a case-by-case basis. In conformity with the practice that has developed, with respect to representatives of independent bodies of counsel or legal associations, media and non-governmental organizations in connection with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the host State will use its best efforts to: a) facilitate the entry into and stay in the host State of such representatives, deployed in, or visiting the host State in connection with activities relating to the Tribunal; and, b) where appropriate and in consultation with the Tribunal, the possible extension of visa while in the host State. I should be grateful if you could confirm on behalf of the United Nations that the above is also the understanding of the United Nations. Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. FRANK MAJOOR H.E. Mr. Nicolas Michel Under-Secretary-General The Legal Counsel United Nations Headquarters Room 3427A New York, NY 10017 United States of America

2.

De bevoegde autoriteiten treffen alle redelijke maatregelen om te waarborgen dat het ongestoord gebruik van het terrein niet wordt belemmerd en dat het terrein kan worden gebruikt voor de doeleinden waarvoor het is bestemd zonder hinder door de wijze van gebruik van de percelen of gebouwen in de omgeving van het terrein.   
4.  Het Tribunaal treft alle redelijke maatregelen om te waarborgen dat het ongestoord gebruik van de percelen in de omgeving van het terrein niet nadelig wordt beïnvloed door de wijze van gebruik van de percelen of gebouwen van het terrein.

Het Tribunaal brengt dergelijke regels na de aanneming ervan terstond ter kennis van de bevoegde autoriteiten.

4.  Het Tribunaal kan personen vanwege schending van zijn regels van het terrein verwijderen of de toegang ertoe ontzeggen en stelt de bevoegde autoriteiten vooraf van dergelijke maatregelen in kennis.

7.  Ieder geschil tussen het Tribunaal en het Gastland over de vraag of regels van het Tribunaal onder dit artikel vallen of over de vraag of wetten of regels van het Gastland onverenigbaar zijn met de regels van het Tribunaal uit hoofde van dit lid, wordt onverwijld beslecht volgens de in artikel 48 van dit Verdrag vervatte procedure. Zolang het geschil nog niet is beslecht, is de regel van het Tribunaal van toepassing en is de wet en/of regel van het Gastland op het terrein niet van toepassing voor zover het Tribunaal deze onverenigbaar met zijn regels acht.   

### Artikel  9  

####Openbare voorzieningen ten behoeve van het terrein

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten zorgen er, op verzoek van de Griffier of van een door hem of haar aangewezen lid van het personeel van het Tribunaal, voor dat het Tribunaal tegen redelijke voorwaarden de beschikking krijgt over de door het Tribunaal benodigde openbare voorzieningen waaronder, echter niet beperkt tot, post-, telefoon- en telegraafdiensten, alle communicatiemiddelen, elektriciteit, water, gas, riolering, ophalen van vuilnis, brandbestrijding, vervoer ter plaatse en reiniging van de openbare weg met inbegrip van het ruimen van sneeuw.   
2.  Wanneer de openbare voorzieningen bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel door de bevoegde autoriteiten aan het Tribunaal worden geleverd of de prijzen daarvan worden bepaald door deze autoriteiten, zijn de tarieven voor deze voorzieningen niet hoger dan de laagste vergelijkbare tarieven voor instellingen en organen van wezenlijk belang voor het Gastland.   
3.  In het geval van onderbreking of dreiging van onderbreking van dergelijke voorzieningen zal aan het Tribunaal de voorrang worden gegeven die ook aan instellingen en organen van wezenlijk belang voor het Gastland worden gegeven, en het Gastland treft de daartoe benodigde maatregelen om te waarborgen dat de werkzaamheden van het Tribunaal niet worden belemmerd.   
4.  De Griffier, of een door hem of haar aangewezen lid van het personeel van het Tribunaal, treft op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteiten passende maatregelen om naar behoren gemachtigde vertegenwoordigers van de desbetreffende nutsbedrijven in staat te stellen op het terrein van het Tribunaal voorzieningen, leidingen, buizen en rioleringen te inspecteren, repareren, onderhouden, reconstrueren of te verplaatsen zonder de uitoefening van de taken van het Tribunaal onnodig te verstoren.   
5.  Ondergrondse werkzaamheden op het terrein kunnen door de bevoegde autoriteiten alleen worden uitgevoerd na overleg met de Griffier of een door hem of haar aangewezen lid van het personeel van het Tribunaal en zonder de uitoefening van de taken van het Tribunaal te verstoren.   

### Artikel  10

1.  Het Tribunaal en zijn fondsen, bezittingen en overige eigendommen, ongeacht waar deze zich bevinden of wie deze onder zich heeft, zijn vrijgesteld van elke vorm van rechtsvervolging, behoudens voor zover het Tribunaal in een bijzonder geval uitdrukkelijk van zijn immuniteit afstand heeft gedaan, evenwel met dien verstande dat afstand van immuniteit zich nooit uitstrekt tot executiemaatregelen.

2.  De beëindiging of afwezigheid van deze onschendbaarheid doet geen afbreuk aan de beschermende maatregelen waartoe het Tribunaal kan bevelen ten aanzien van aan het Tribunaal beschikbaar gestelde of door het Tribunaal gebruikte materialen en documenten.   

### Artikel  13  

####Faciliteiten met betrekking tot communicatie

1.  Ten behoeve van zijn officiële communicatie en correspondentie geniet het Tribunaal op het grondgebied van het Gastland een behandeling die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke door het Gastland wordt toegekend aan een intergouvernementele organisatie of diplomatieke missie ter zake van prioriteiten, tarieven en belastingen die van toepassing zijn op post en uiteenlopende vormen van communicatie en correspondentie.   
2.  De officiële communicatie en correspondentie van het Tribunaal worden niet gecensureerd.

Het Tribunaal is bevoegd alle geschikte communicatiemiddelen te gebruiken, met inbegrip van elektronische communicatiemiddelen, en heeft het recht ten behoeve van zijn officiële communicatie en correspondentie codes of versleutelde gegevens te gebruiken. De officiële communicatie en correspondentie van het Tribunaal zijn onschendbaar.   
4.  Het Tribunaal heeft het recht correspondentie en andere materialen of berichten te verzenden en te ontvangen per koerier of in verzegelde tassen, ten aanzien waarvan dezelfde voorrechten, immuniteiten en faciliteiten gelden als voor diplomatieke koeriers en tassen.   
5.  Het Tribunaal heeft het recht radioapparatuur en andere telecommunicatieapparatuur te gebruiken op de frequenties die aan het Tribunaal zijn toegewezen door het Gastland in overeenstemming met zijn nationale procedures. Het Gastland streeft ernaar de door het Tribunaal aangevraagde frequenties zoveel mogelijk toe te wijzen.   
6.  Teneinde zijn doelstellingen te verwezenlijken en zich doeltreffend van zijn verantwoordelijkheden te kwijten in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag heeft het Tribunaal het recht vrijelijk en zonder beperkingen berichten te publiceren in het Gastland.   

### Artikel  14  

####Vrijheid van beperkingen ten aanzien van financiële bezittingen

1.  Het Tribunaal is niet onderworpen aan financiële controles, voorschriften, kennisgevingsvereisten met betrekking tot financiële transacties, of moratoria van enigerlei aard, en kan vrijelijk: 

a. elke valuta kopen, bezitten en gebruiken;  

b. rekeningen aanhouden in welke valuta ook;
