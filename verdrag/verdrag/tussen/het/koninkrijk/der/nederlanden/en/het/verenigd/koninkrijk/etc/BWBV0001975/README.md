####Principles Governing the Operation of Agreed Services

1.  There shall be fair and equal opportunity for the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties to operate the agreed services on the specified routes between their respective territories.   
2.  In operating the agreed services the designated airline or airlines of each Contracting Party shall take into account the interests of the designated airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provide on the whole or part of the same routes.   
3.  The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall bear a close relationship to the requirements of the public for transportation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provision at a reasonable load factor of capacity adequate to carry the current and reasonably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers and cargo, including mail, coming from or destined for the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline. Provision for the carriage of passengers and cargo, including mail, both taken on board and discharged at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating the airline shall be made in accordance with the general principles that capacity shall be related to: 

a) traffic requirements to and from the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline;  

b) traffic requirements of the area through which the agreed service passes, after taking account of other transport services established by airlines of the States comprising the area; and  

c) the requirements of through airline operation.     

### Article  7  

####Tariffs

1. 
a) The term “tariff" means: 

(i) the price to be charged for the carriage of passengers, baggage or cargo (excluding mail);  

(ii) the additional goods, services or other benefits to be furnished or made available in conjunction with such carriage or as a matter which is incidental thereto or consequential thereon; and  

(iii) the prices to be charged for such additional goods, services or benefits; and includes the conditions that are to govern the applicability of any such price and the furnishing or availability of any such goods, services or benefits.  

(iv) the rate of commission paid by an airline to an agent in respect of tickets sold or air waybills completed by that agent for carriage on scheduled air services.    

b) Where fares or rates differ according to the season, day of the week or time of the day on which a flight is operated, the direction of travel or according to some other factor, each different fare or rate shall be regarded as a separate tariff whether or not it has been filed separately with the related conditions with the relevant authorities.     
2.  The tariffs to be charged by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties for carriage between their territories shall be those approved by the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties and shall be established at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including the cost of operating the agreed services, the interests of users, reasonable profit and market considerations.   
3.  The aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties shall not require their airlines to consult other airlines before filing for approval tariffs for services covered by the following provisions.   
4.  Each proposed tariff for carriage between the territories of the Contracting Parties shall be filed by the designated airline seeking approval for it with the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties in such form as the aeronautical authority of each Contracting Party may require to disclose the particulars referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. It shall be filed not less than 30 days (or such shorter period as the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties may agree) before the proposed effective date. Each proposed tariff shall be treated as having been filed with a Contracting Party on the date on which it is received by the aeronautical authority of that Contracting Party.   
5.  

a) Each proposed tariff may be approved by the aeronautical authority of either Contracting Party at any time. In the absence of such approval and provided it has been filed in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, it will be treated as having been approved by the aeronautical authority of a Contracting Party 21 days after the date of filing unless within 20 days after the date of filing the aeronautical authority of that Contracting Party has served on the aeronautical authority of the other Contracting Party written notice of disapproval of the proposed tariff.  

b) Each proposed tariff which has been filed in the form required by paragraph 4 of this Article, but not in conformity with the minimum filing period therein specified, shall nevertheless be treated as having been approved by the aeronautical authority of a Contracting Party 21 days after the date of filing unless the aeronautical authority of that Contracting Party has either: 

(i) notified the airline filing the proposed tariff within 15 days after the date of filing that the proposed tariff must be refiled in conformity with the minimum filing period, or  

(ii) served on the aeronautical authority of the other Contracting Party within 20 days after the date of filing written notice of disapproval of the proposed tariff.       
6.  In approving each tariff the aeronautical authority of a Contracting Party may attach to its approval such expiry date as it considers appropriate.   
7.  If a notice of disapproval is given in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, the aeronautical authorities of the two Contracting Parties may determine the tariff by mutual agreement. Either Contracting Party may, within 30 days of the service of a notice of disapproval, request consultations which shall be held within 30 days of the request.   
8.  If a tariff has been disapproved by one of the aeronautical authorities in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article, and the aeronautical authorities have been unable to determine the tariff by agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article, the dispute may be settled in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of this Agreement.   
9.  Subject to paragraph 10 of this Article a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall remain in force unless withdrawn by the designated airline concerned or until a replacement tariff has been established.   
10.  Except with the agreement of the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties, and for such period as they may agree, a tariff shall not be prolonged by virtue of paragraph (9) of this Article: 

a) where a tariff has an expiry date, for more than 12 months after that date;  

b) where a tariff has no expiry date, for more than 12 months after the date on which the designated airline or airlines of one Contracting Party or both, file a replacement tariff with the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties.     
11.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 4–10 above, the aeronautical authority of the United Kingdom does not require the filing for its approval of tariffs for the carriage of cargo between points in the territories of the two Contracting Parties. In such cases, references in paragraphs 4–10 above to receipt of filings shall be deemed to refer to the receipt of such filings by the Netherlands Antilles Government.   
12.  

a) The tariffs to be charged by a designated airline of one Contracting Party for carriage between the territory of the other Contracting Party and a third State shall be filed for the approval of the aeronautical authority of the other Contracting Party. Each tariff filed shall be given approval if it is identical in level, conditions and date of expiry to a tariff currently approved by that aeronautical authority and applied by a designated airline of that other Contracting Party for carriage between its territory and that of the third State, provided that the aeronautical authority may withdraw its approval if the tariff being matched is discontinued for any reason, or may vary the terms of the approval to correspond to any approved variation in the tariff being matched.  

b) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph a) above, the aeronautical authority of the United Kingdom does not require the filing for its approval of tariffs to be charged by the designated airline or airlines of the Netherlands Antilles for the carriage of cargo between the territory of the United Kingdom and the third State.     

### Article  8  

####Customs Duties

1.  Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into or taken on board aircraft in the territory of one Contracting Party by, or on behalf of, the airlines designated by the other Contracting Party and intended solely for use by the aircraft of such designated airlines shall be accorded, with respect to customs duties, inspection fees or other charges imposed by the former Contracting Party, treatment not less favourable than that granted to its own designated airlines.   
2.  Aircraft operated on the agreed services and supplies of fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores retained on board aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of one Contracting Party shall be exempt in the territory of the other Contracting Party from customs duties, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used by such aircraft on flights in that territory. Goods so exempted may only be unloaded with the approval of the customs authorities of the other Contracting Party. These goods, which are to be re-exported, shall be kept until re-exportation under customs supervision.   

### Article  9  

####Aviation Security

1.  The assurance of safety for civil aircraft, their passengers and crew being a fundamental pre-condition for the operation of international air services, the Contracting Parties reaffirm that their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference (and in particular their obligations under the Chicago Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971 and the Protocol for Suppressions of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988) form an integral part of this Agreement.

3.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security Standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the Recommended Practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and designated as Annexes to the Chicago Convention; and shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions. In this paragraph the reference to aviation security Standards includes any difference notified by the Contracting Party concerned. Each Contracting Party shall give advance information to the other of its intention to notify any difference.   
4.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet increases in the threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that their airlines may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article required by the other Contracting Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate as rapidly as possible commensurate with minimum risk to life such incident or threat.   

### Article  10  

####Provision of Statistics

The aeronautical authority of a Contracting Party shall supply to the aeronautical authority of the other Contracting Party at its request such periodic or other statements of statistics as may be reasonably required for the purpose of reviewing the capacity provided on the agreed services by the designated airline or airlines of the Contracting Party referred to first in this Article. Such statements shall include all information required to determine the amount of traffic carried by those airlines on the agreed services and the origins and destinations of such traffic.  

### Article  11  

####Transfer of Earnings

Each designated airline may convert and remit to its country on demand local revenues in excess of sums locally disbursed. Conversion and remittance shall be permitted without restrictions at the rate of exchange applicable to current transactions which is in effect at the time such revenues are presented for conversion and remittance, and shall not be subject to any charges except those normally made by banks for carrying out such conversion and remittance.  

### Article  12  

####Airline Representation and Sales

1.  The designated airline or airlines of one Contracting Party may, in accordance with the laws and regulations relating to entry, residence and employment of the other Contracting Party, bring in and maintain in the territory of the other Contracting Party those of their own managerial, technical, operational and other specialist staff who are required for the provision of air services.   
2.  The designated airline or airlines of each Contracting Party may engage in the sale of air transportation in the territory of the other Contracting Party, either directly or through agents appointed by the designated airline. The designated airline or airlines of each Contracting Party may sell, and any person shall be free to purchase, such transportation in local currency or in any freely convertible other currency.   

### Article  13  

####User Charges

1.  Neither Contracting Party shall impose or permit to be imposed on the designated airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party user charges higher than those imposed on its own airlines operating similar international air services.   
2.  Each Contracting Party shall encourage consultation on user charges between their competent charging authorities and airlines using the services and facilities provided by those charging authorities, where practicable through those airlines' representative organisations. Reasonable notice of any proposals for changes in user charges should be given to such users to enable them to express their views before changes are made. Each Contracting Party shall further encourage its competent charging authorities and such users to exchange appropriate information concerning user charges.   

### Article  14  

####Consultation

Either Contracting Party may at any time request consultations on the implementation, interpretation, application or amendment of this Agreement or compliance with this Agreement. Such consultations, which may be between aeronautical authorities, shall begin within a period of 60 days from the date the other Contracting Party receives a written request, unless otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties.
