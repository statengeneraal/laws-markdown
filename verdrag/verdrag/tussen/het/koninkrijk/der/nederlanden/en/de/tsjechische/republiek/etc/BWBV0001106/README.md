a. indien een zodanige luchtvaartmaatschappij nalaat ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van die Verdragsluitende Partij aan te tonen dat zij voldoet aan de door die autoriteiten gewoonlijk en redelijkerwijze in overeenstemming met het Verdrag van Chicago toegepaste wetten en voorschriften;  

b. indien een zodanige luchtvaartmaatschappij nalaat de wetten en voorschriften van die Verdragsluitende Partij na te leven;  

c. ingeval niet te hunnen genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op de luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Verdragsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen of bij haar onderdanen; en  

d. indien de luchtvaartmaatschappij anderszins nalaat de exploitatie te voeren in overeenstemming met de ingevolge dit Verdrag gestelde voorwaarden.     
2.  Tenzij onmiddellijk ingrijpen van wezenlijk belang is ter voorkoming van verdere inbreuken op de hierboven bedoelde wetten en voorschriften, worden de in het eerste lid van dit artikel opgesomde rechten slechts uitgeoefend na overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Tenzij anders door de Verdragsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, vangt zulk overleg aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek ter zake.   

### Artikel  5  

####Tarieven

1.  De door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen in rekening te brengen tarieven voor vervoer tussen hun grondgebieden dienen de tarieven te zijn die zijn goedgekeurd door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, en dienen te zijn vastgesteld op een redelijk niveau, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle relevante factoren, waaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst en de tarieven van de andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die een deel van de omschreven route exploiteren.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, indien mogelijk, overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen door middel van toepassing van de procedures van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging ("International Air Transport Association") voor de vaststelling van tarieven. Wanneer zulks niet mogelijk is, worden de tarieven overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen. In elk geval is voor de tarieven de goedkeuring van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen vereist.   
3.  Alle aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden ten minste zestig (60) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van invoering ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, tenzij de bedoelde autoriteiten overeenkomen deze termijn in bijzondere gevallen te bekorten.   
4.  De tarieven kunnen uitdrukkelijk worden goedgekeurd of worden, indien geen van beide luchtvaartautoriteiten binnen dertig (30) dagen na de datum van voorlegging overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel te kennen heeft gegeven de tarieven niet goed te keuren, geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Ingeval de termijn van voorlegging wordt bekort, zoals bepaald in het derde lid van dit artikel, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overeenkomen dat de termijn waarbinnen kennisgeving van afkeuring moet geschieden, dienovereenkomstig wordt bekort.   
5.  Indien een tarief niet kan worden overeengekomen overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien gedurende de overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel geldende termijn de ene luchtvaartautoriteit de andere luchtvaartautoriteit te kennen geeft dat zij een overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel overeengekomen tarief niet goedkeurt, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen het tarief in onderlinge overeenstemming vast te stellen.   
6.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken omtrent een overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel aan hen voorgelegd tarief, of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt het geschil geregeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 17 van dit Verdrag.   
7.  Overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
8.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven in rekening brengen die afwijken van die welke in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn goedgekeurd.   

### Artikel  6  

####Commerciële activiteiten

1.  Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen toegestaan om:

Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij toegestaan om haar in verband met het verzorgen van luchtvervoer redelijkerwijs benodigde leidinggevend, commercieel, operationeel en technisch personeel te zenden naar en te doen verblijven op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
3.  In deze behoeften aan personeel kan naar keuze van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij (en) worden voorzien door eigen personeel of door gebruikmaking van de diensten van een andere organisatie, onderneming of luchtvaartmaatschappij die werkzaam is op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en die gemachtigd is dergelijke diensten te verlenen op het grondgebied van die Verdragsluitende Partij.   
4.  De bovengenoemde activiteiten worden verricht in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  7  

####Eerlijke concurrentie

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen worden op eerlijke en gelijke wijze in de gelegenheid gesteld deel te nemen aan het internationale luchtvervoer waarop dit Verdrag betrekking heeft.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij treft alle passende maatregelen binnen haar rechtsmacht ter bestrijding van alle vormen van discriminatie of oneerlijke concurrentiepraktijken die de concurrentiepositie van de luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij nadelig beïnvloeden.   
3.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van een Verdragsluitende Partij houdt (houden) bij de exploitatie van diensten op een omschreven route gepast rekening met de belangen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, indien deze diensten exploiteert (exploiteren) op dezelfde route.

### Artikel  8  

####Dienstregeling

1.  Een door elke Verdragsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij legt de dienstregeling van haar voorgenomen diensten vijfenveertig (45) dagen tevoren ter goedkeuring voor aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, en vermeldt daarbij de frequentie, het type luchtvaartuig, de indeling en het aantal zitplaatsen dat beschikbaar zal zijn voor het publiek.   
2.  Verzoeken om toestemming voor het uitvoeren van extra vluchten kunnen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij rechtstreeks aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij ter goedkeuring worden voorgelegd.

Luchtvaartuigen die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen voor internationale luchtdiensten worden gebruikt, alsmede hun normale uitrustingsstukken, reserveonderdelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen, proviand (met inbegrip van etenswaren, dranken en tabaksartikelen) aan boord, alsmede reclame- en promotiemateriaal dat zich aan boord van zodanige luchtvaartuigen bevindt, zijn vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, inspectiekosten en soortgelijke nationale of lokale heffingen en belastingen bij binnenkomst op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, mits deze uitrustingsstukken en voorraden aan boord van de luchtvaartuigen blijven totdat zij opnieuw worden uitgevoerd.   
2.  Met betrekking tot normale uitrustingsstukken, reserveonderdelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en boordproviand die worden ingevoerd op het grondgebied van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij door of ten behoeve van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, of aan boord van de door deze aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij gexploiteerde luchtvaartuigen worden genomen uitsluitend voor gebruik aan boord van de luchtvaartuigen bij de exploitatie van internationale diensten, behoeven geen heffingen of belastingen te worden betaald, met inbegrip van douaneheffingen en inspectiekosten die verschuldigd zijn op het grondgebied van de eerste Verdragsluitende Partij, zelfs indien deze voorraden zullen worden gebruikt tijdens de gedeelten van de vlucht die worden afgelegd boven het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord zijn genomen. Ten aanzien van de bovengenoemde goederen kan worden verlangd dat deze onder het toezicht en beheer van de douane blijven. De bepalingen van dit lid mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat een Verdragsluitende Partij kan worden verplicht tot terugbetaling aan de desbetreffende aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van douanerechten die reeds op bovenbedoelde goederen zijn geheven.   
3.  Normale uitrustingsstukken, reserveonderdelen, voorraden brandstof, smeermiddelen en proviand aan boord van luchtvaartuigen van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van deze Partij, die kunnen verlangen dat deze materialen onder hun toezicht worden geplaatst totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.

### Artikel  12  

####Toepassing van wetten, voorschriften en procedures

1.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van een Verdragsluitende Partij betreffende de toelating tot of het vertrek uit haar grondgebied van in internationale luchtdiensten gebruikte luchtvaartuigen of betreffende de exploitatie van en het vliegen met zodanige luchtvaartuigen dienen door een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij te worden nageleefd vanaf de binnenkomst in en tot en met het vertrek uit bedoeld grondgebied.   
2.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van een Verdragsluitende Partij betreffende immigratie, paspoorten of andere erkende reisdocumenten, binnenkomst, inklaring, douane en quarantaine dienen te worden nageleefd door of namens bemanningsleden, passagiers, vracht en post die worden vervoerd door luchtvaartuigen van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij vanaf de binnenkomst in en tot en met het vertrek uit het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij.   
3.  Passagiers, bagage en vracht die op doorreis zijn via het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij en die de daarvoor gereserveerde zone van de luchthaven niet verlaten, worden, behalve wat veiligheidsmaatregelen tegen geweld en luchtpiraterij betreft, slechts aan een vereenvoudigde controle onderworpen. Bagage en vracht op doorreis zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en andere soortgelijke belastingen.   
4.  Kosten en heffingen die op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij met betrekking tot de vluchten van de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij in rekening worden gebracht voor het gebruik van luchthavens en andere luchtvaartvoorzieningen op het grondgebied van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij, mogen niet hoger zijn dan die welke in rekening worden gebracht met betrekking tot de vluchten van een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij die soortgelijke vluchten uitvoert.   
5.  Geen van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen begunstigt een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij ten opzichte van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij bij de toepassing van haar voorschriften inzake douane, immigratie, quarantaine en soortgelijke voorschriften, of bij het gebruik van luchthavens, luchtwegen, luchtverkeersdiensten en aanverwante voorzieningen waarover zij zeggenschap heeft.

####Erkenning van bewijzen en vergunningen

Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen die door een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn uitgereikt of geldig verklaard en die nog niet zijn verlopen, worden door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij als geldig erkend voor de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes, mits deze bewijzen en vergunningen werden uitgereikt of geldig verklaard overeenkomstig de op grond van het Verdrag van Chicago vastgestelde normen. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor om voor vluchten boven haar grondgebied de erkenning te weigeren van bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen die aan haar eigen onderdanen zijn verstrekt door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.  

### Artikel  14  

####Veiligheid van de luchtvaart

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen handelen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag inzake strafbare feiten en bepaalde andere handelingen begaan aan boord van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te Tokio op 14 september 1963, het Verdrag tot bestrijding van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te 's-Gravenhage op 16 december 1970, en het Verdrag tot bestrijding van wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, ondertekend te Montreal op 23 september 1971, voor zover de Verdragsluitende Partijen beide partij zijn bij deze Verdragen.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen verlenen elkaar op verzoek alle bijstand die nodig is ter voorkoming van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van burgerluchtvaartuigen en andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van zodanige luchtvaartuigen, hun passagiers en bemanning, luchthavens en luchtvaartvoorzieningen, en elke andere bedreiging voor de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen handelen in hun onderlinge betrekkingen in overeenstemming met de veiligheidsbepalingen voor de luchtvaart die zijn vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie en de status van bijlagen bij het Verdrag van Chicago hebben gekregen, voor zover die veiligheidsbepalingen van toepassing zijn op de Verdragsluitende Partijen; zij verlangen dat exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen die geregistreerd staan op hun grondgebied of exploitanten van luchtvaartuigen die hun hoofdvestiging of vaste verblijfplaats hebben op hun grondgebied, alsmede de exploitanten van luchthavens op hun grondgebied handelen in overeenstemming met die veiligheidsbepalingen voor de luchtvaart.   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij stemt ermede in dat die exploitanten of die luchtvaartuigen kunnen worden verplicht tot inachtneming van de in het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde veiligheidsbepalingen voor de luchtvaart die door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij worden gehanteerd voor de binnenkomst in of het vertrek uit dan wel tijdens het verblijf op het grondgebied van die andere Verdragsluitende Partij.

Wanneer zich een voorval voordoet van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van een luchtvaartuig of van andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van luchtvaartuigen, hun passagiers en bemanning, luchthavens en luchtvaartvoorzieningen, of dreigt zich voor te doen, verlenen de Verdragsluitende Partijen elkaar bijstand door de verbindingen die bedoeld zijn om op snelle en veilige wijze aan zulk een voorval of de dreiging daarvan een einde te maken, te vergemakkelijken.   
8.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij redelijke gronden heeft om aan te nemen dat de andere Verdragsluitende Partij is afgeweken van de veiligheidsbepalingen voor de luchtvaart van dit artikel, kunnen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van die Verdragsluitende Partij verzoeken om onmiddellijk overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Tenzij anders overeengekomen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen, vangt dat overleg aan binnen een tijdvak van zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van een zodanig verzoek.   

### Artikel  15  

####Geautomatiseerde Boekingssystemen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen dat: 

a. het belang van gebruikers van luchtvervoerdiensten zal worden beschermd tegen alle misbruik van desbetreffende informatie, met inbegrip van misleidende voorstelling daarvan;  

b. een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Verdragsluitende Partij en de agenten van die luchtvaartmaatschappij onbeperkt en non-discriminatoir toegang tot en gebruik van de GBS-en hebben op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij;  

c. in dit verband de GBS-Gedragscode die op het grondgebied van de onderscheiden Verdragsluitende Partijen is aangenomen, van toepassing zal zijn.     
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt aan de GBS-en die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij als hoofdsysteem zijn gekozen, vrije en onbelemmerde toegang tot haar grondgebied. Geen der Verdragsluitende Partijen zal op haar grondgebied aan het GBS dat is gekozen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij strengere eisen opleggen of toelaten dat deze worden opgelegd, dan die opgelegd aan het GBS van haar eigen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en).   

### Artikel  16  

####Overleg en wijziging

1.  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd overleg met elkaar ten einde te verzekeren dat de bepalingen van dit Verdrag worden uitgevoerd en naar tevredenheid worden nageleefd.   
2.  Elk der Verdragsluitende Partijen kan verzoeken om overleg met het oog op wijziging van dit Verdrag of van de Bijlage daarbij. Dit overleg vangt aan binnen zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, tenzij anders overeengekomen.

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Geschillen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag of de Bijlage daarbij worden geregeld door middel van rechtstreekse onderhandelingen tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen. Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten er niet in slagen tot overeenstemming te komen, wordt het geschil langs diplomatieke weg geregeld.   
2.  Indien de Verdragsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen het geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandeling, kan het op verzoek van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan een gerecht van drie scheidsmannen, van wie elke Verdragsluitende Partij er een benoemt, waarna de aldus gekozen twee scheidsmannen overeenstemming bereiken over de derde, op voorwaarde dat de derde scheidsman geen onderdaan van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen is. Elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen wijst een scheidsman aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum waarop een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij een diplomatieke nota heeft ontvangen waarin om een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing van het geschil wordt verzocht, en over de derde scheidsman wordt binnen een volgende termijn van zestig (60) dagen overeenstemming bereikt. Indien een der Verdragsluitende Partijen haar eigen scheidsman niet aanwijst binnen de termijn van zestig (60) dagen of indien over de derde scheidsman niet binnen de genoemde termijn overeenstemming is bereikt, kan de Voorzitter van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie door een der Verdragsluitende Partijen worden verzocht een scheidsman of scheidsmannen te benoemen. De kosten van de arbitrage worden in gelijke delen gedragen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen.

Deze kennisgeving wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In dit geval eindigt het Verdrag twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, tenzij de kennisgeving van opzegging in onderling overleg voor het einde van dit tijdvak wordt ingetrokken. Indien de andere Verdragsluitende Partij nalaat de ontvangst te bevestigen, wordt de kennisgeving geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de kennisgeving door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.

### Bijlage  

###Deel a

Routetabel bij het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Tsjechische Republiek inzake luchtdiensten tussen en via hun onderscheiden grondgebieden: 

1. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de Tsjechische Republiek heeft (hebben) het recht luchtdiensten te exploiteren op de hieronder aangegeven routes: punten in de Tsjechische Republiek - tussenliggende punten - punten in Nederland - verder gelegen punten, in beide richtingen.  

2. De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden heeft (hebben) het recht luchtdiensten te exploiteren op de hieronder aangegeven routes: punten in Nederland - tussenliggende punten - punten in de Tsjechische Republiek - verder gelegen punten, in beide richtingen.   
###Deel b

1. Elk punt of alle punten op de omschreven routes kan of kunnen, naar keuze van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, op een vlucht of op alle vluchten worden overgeslagen.  

2. Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en van de Tsjechische Republiek toegestaan vluchten te exploiteren op de hierboven omschreven routes zonder beperkingen ten aanzien van frequentie en type luchtvaartuig, in alle klassen.  

3. De capaciteit op de door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen te exploiteren overeengekomen diensten wordt tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen overeengekomen op basis van het beginsel van eerlijke en gelijke kansen.  

4. Elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft het recht volledige vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uit te oefenen op alle tussenliggende en verder gelegen punten in haar onderscheiden routetabel.  

5. Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Verdragsluitende Partij heeft evenwel niet het recht vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uit te oefenen op verder gelegen gedeelten waarop een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij derde- en vierde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uitoefent, tenzij 

a. de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen anders overeenkomen, of  

b. de betrokken luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen een commerciële overeenkomst sluiten.   Ingeval een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Verdragsluitende Partij vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uitoefent op een gedeelte waarop een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij derde- en vierde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten begint uit te oefenen in de loop van een IATA-seizoen, mag de eerstbedoelde aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij haar uitoefening van vijfdevrijheidsverkeersrechten voortzetten tot het einde van dat IATA-seizoen.
