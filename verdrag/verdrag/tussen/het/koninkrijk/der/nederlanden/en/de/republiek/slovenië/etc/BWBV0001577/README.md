### Article  15

####Transfer of residence without entitlement to benefits under the legislation of the new State of residence

If a person who has been insured under the legislation of one of the Contracting Parties is transferring his residence to the territory of the other Party, but does not satisfy the conditions for entitlement to benefits under the legislation of the latter Party, and if that person would still be entitled to such benefits under the legislation of the first Party if he were residing in the territory of that Party, such entitlement will nevertheless be retained.

### Article  18  

####Stay outside the territory of the competent State – return to or transfer of residence to the territory of the other Contracting Party during sickness or maternity – provision of major benefits

2.  A person who is entitled to benefits at the expense of an institution of one of the Contracting Parties and who resides in the territory of that Party, retains that entitlement when he transfers his residence to the territory of the other Contracting Party.

3.  When a person is entitled to benefits in kind according to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, these benefits shall be provided at the expense of the competent institution by the institution of the place of temporary stay or residence according to the provisions of the legislation applied by the latter institution, as if the person concerned were affiliated to it. The period during which such benefits are provided shall, however, be that laid down under the legislation of the competent State.

Where a person receiving pensions under the legislation of both Contracting Parties is entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory he is resident, such benefits shall be provided to him and the members of his family by the institution of the place of residence at its own cost, as if he were a pensioner under the legislation of the latter Party only.   
2.  Where a person receiving a pension under the legislation of one Contracting Party resides in the territory of the other Contracting Party and he is not entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the latter Contracting Party, the institution of the place of his residence provides according to the legislation which it applies, and at the expense of the competent institution, this person and the members of his family with benefits in kind to which this person is entitled under the legislation of the first Contracting Party or would be entitled if he were to reside in its territory.   
3.  Where the members of the family of a person receiving a pension under the legislation of one Contracting Party or pensions under the legislation of both Contracting Parties are resident in the territory of a Contracting Party other than that in which the pensioner himself resides, they shall receive benefits in kind as if the pensioner were resident in the same territory, provided that he is entitled to such benefits under the legislation of a Contracting Party. These benefits shall be provided at the expense of the competent institution by the institution of the place of residence of the members of the family according to the provisions of the legislation which it applies, as if they were entitled to such benefits under that legislation.   
4.  If the members of the family referred to in the preceding paragraph transfer their residence to the territory of the Contracting Party in which the pensioner resides, they shall be entitled to benefits in kind in accordance with the legislation of that Party, even if they have already received such benefits for the same case of sickness and maternity before transferring their residence.   
5.  A person receiving a pension under the legislation of one Contracting Party and who is entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of this Contracting Party, shall as well as the members of his family, be entitled to such benefits during a temporary stay in the territory of the Contracting Party other than the one in whose territory they reside, when their condition requires the immediate provision of such benefits.   
6.  In the case referred to in the preceding paragraph, the benefits in kind shall be provided at the expense of the institution of the place of residence of the pensioner or the members of the family, by the institution of the place of temporary stay, according to its legislation, as if the person concerned were entitled to such benefits under this legislation. The period during which these benefits are provided shall, however, be that laid down under the legislation of the State of residence. The provisions of Article 18, paragraph 4, are applicable by analogy.   
7.  Where the legislation of a Contracting Party provides for the contributions to be deducted from the pension payable for the purpose of entitlement to benefits in kind, the institution of the Contracting Party which pays the pension shall be authorized to make such deductions if the cost of benefits in kind is borne by an institution of that Contracting Party by virtue of this Article.   
8.  The provisions of this Article shall not be applicable to members of the family who are entitled to benefits in kind under the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which they reside because of their gainful occupation or their receiving social security benefit of the Contracting Party in whose territory they reside.   
9.  The provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article shall not be applicable to persons who are going to the territory of the Contracting Party other than the one in whose territory they reside, for the purpose of receiving medical treatment.   

### Article  20  

####Calculation of Slovenian maternity cash benefit

If according to Slovenian legislation the amount of maternity benefit is calculated on the basis of the previous salary of the insured person, the Slovenian competent institution must take into consideration exclusively the salary received by the insured person during his last employment in Slovenia, whereby the average salary of the insured person received in Slovenia is determined as the average salary of the entire prescribed period.  

### Article  21

1.  The benefits in kind provided according to this chapter shall be refunded by the competent institutions or, where appropriate, by the institutions of the place of residence, to the institutions who have provided these benefits.

### CHAPTER  2  

####COMMON PROVISIONS ON DISABILITY, OLD-AGE AND DEATH

### Article  22  

Where, under the legislation of one Contracting Party the conditions for acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to a benefit are not fulfilled solely on the basis of insurance periods completed under this legislation the competent institution shall for the fulfilment of these conditions take into account also insurance periods completed under the legislation of the other Contracting Party, unless the periods overlap.  

### Article  23  

The right to a pension according to the legislation of one Contracting Party does not exist if the insurance period completed under this legislation amounts to less than 12 months. This shall not apply if the right to a pension exists solely on the basis of this insurance period.  

####IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SLOVENIAN LEGISLATION

### Article  24  

1.  If the conditions for granting the right to a benefit are fulfilled under the Slovenian legislation also without the addition of insurance periods completed in both Contracting Parties, the competent institution in Slovenia shall provide the benefit solely on the basis of insurance periods completed under the Slovenian legislation.   
2.  In case a person only complies with the conditions required for the granting of benefits if Article 22 is taken into consideration, the competent institution first calculates the theoretic sum of the benefit to which a person would be entitled as if the entire insurance period taken into account under the legislation of both Contracting Parties was completed under the legislation relevant for him. If the benefit sum does not depend on the insurance period, it is regarded as the theoretical sum.   
3.  On the basis of the sum from the previous paragraph, the competent institution calculates the actual amount of a benefit which he is obliged to pay out in relation to the duration of the insurance period to be taken into account under the legislation relevant for him and the entire insurance period which is to be taken into account under the legislation of both Contracting Parties.   

### Article  25  

1.  For implementing Article 24, paragraph 2, to establish the pension basis according to the Slovenian legislation exclusively the Slovenian pension basis is taken into account.   
2.  If in the implementing of Article 24, paragraph 3, the entire insurance period which is taken into account under the legislation of both Contracting Parties exceeds the maximum possible insurance period which has been established according to Slovenian legislation for the benefits assessment, the pro rata pension to be paid out is calculated as a relation between the insurance period under Slovenian legislation and the above stated maximum possible number of insurance months.   

####IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION

### Article  26  

Where a person at the time when incapacity for work followed by invalidity occurred, was subject to Slovenian legislation on pensions and entitled to Slovenian invalidity pension, and had previously completed insurance periods under the Netherlands legislation on invalidity insurance, he shall be entitled to a benefit under the latter legislation, calculated according to the rules of Article 27.  

### Article  27  

1.  The amount of the benefit referred to in Article 26 shall be calculated in proportion to the ratio of the total length of the periods of insurance completed by the person concerned under the Netherlands legislation after the age of 15 years to the period between the date on which he reached the age of 15 and the date of his incapacity for work followed by invalidity.   
2.  If, at the time when incapacity for work followed by invalidity occurred, the person concerned was an employed person or a person treated as such, the benefit due shall be determined according to the Disablement Benefits Act of 18 February 1966 (WAO). If not, the benefit due shall be determined according to the Self-employed Persons Disablement Benefits Act of 24 April 1997 (WAZ).   
3.  As periods of insurance completed under the Netherlands legislation shall be considered: 

a) periods of insurance completed under the Disablement Benefits Act of 18 February 1966 (WAO);

c) periods of insurance completed under the Self-employed Persons Disablement Benefits Act of 24 April 1997 (WAZ);  

d) periods of employment and periods treated as such completed in the Netherlands before 1 July 1967.     
4.  In the case referred to in paragraph 2, first sentence of this Article, when an insurance period under the WAO coincides with an insurance period under the AAW, only the period completed under the WAO shall be taken into account.   
5.  In the case referred to in paragraph 2, second sentence of this Article, when an insurance period under the AAW coincides with an insurance period under the WAO, only the period completed under the AAW shall be taken into account.   

### Article  28

The reduction referred to in Article 13, paragraph 1 of the Law on general old-age insurance (AOW) shall not be applied to calendar years or parts thereof before the entry into force of this Convention during which a married woman or a widow between the age of 15 years and 65 years, residing in Slovenia, was not insured under the abovementioned law in so far as the calendar years or parts thereof coincide with periods of insurance completed during their marriage by her husband under that legislation. By way of derogation from Article 7 of the AOW, the said woman shall be considered as being entitled to a pension.   
3.  The reduction referred to in Article 13, paragraph 2 of the AOW shall not be applied to calendar years or parts thereof before the entry into force of this Convention during which the married woman of the pensioner resided in Slovenia between the age of 15 years and 65 years and was not insured under the abovementioned legislation in so far as the calendar years or parts thereof coincide with periods of insurance completed during their marriage by her husband under that legislation.

This authorization ceases on the date of termination of the compulsory insurance of the employed person. The aforementioned authorization shall not cease, however, where the compulsory insurance of the employed person is terminated as a result of his death and where his widow receives only a pension under the Netherlands legislation on general insurance for survivors Act (ANW). In any event, the authorization in respect of voluntary insurance ceases on the date on which the voluntarily insured person reaches the age of 65 years. The contribution which has to be paid for the aforementioned voluntary insurance shall be determined for the spouse of an employed person who is compulsorily insured under the AOW and the ANW in accordance with the provisions relating to the determination of the contribution of compulsory insurance, subject to the condition that his or her income shall be deemed to have been received in the Netherlands. For the spouse of an employed person who was compulsorily insured on or after the date of entry into force of this Convention the contribution shall be determined in accordance with the provisions relating to the determination of the contribution for voluntary insurance under the AOW and the ANW.

The amount of the benefit referred to in Article 29 shall be calculated in proportion to the ratio of the total length of the periods of insurance completed by the deceased under the Netherlands legislation before he reached the age of 65 to the period between the date on which he reached the age of 15 years and the date of his death, but at the latest the date on which he reached the age of 65 years.  

### CHAPTER  3

1.  Personen die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde staat wonen en aan de in de wetgeving van laatstgenoemde staat gestelde voorwaarden voor het recht op prestaties voldoen, ontvangen, wanneer van toepassing met inachtneming van artikel 14, op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij wonen:

2.  Het in het voorgaande lid bepaalde is, wat het recht op verstrekkingen betreft, van overeenkomstige toepassing op de gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde staat wonen, voor zover zij krachtens de wetgeving van de staat op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen, geen aanspraak hebben op dergelijke verstrekkingen vanwege betaalde werkzaamheden of omdat zij een sociale- zekerheidsuitkering ontvangen van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen.   

### Artikel  16  

####Overbrenging van de woonplaats zonder aanspraak op prestaties krachtens de wetgeving van de nieuwe woonstaat

Indien een persoon die verzekerd is krachtens de wetgeving van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn woonplaats overbrengt naar het grondgebied van de andere Partij, maar niet voldoet aan de voorwaarden voor aanspraak op prestaties krachtens de wetgeving van laatstgenoemde Partij, en indien die persoon krachtens de wetgeving van eerstgenoemde Partij nog steeds aanspraak zou hebben op die prestaties indien hij op het grondgebied van die Partij woonde, zal hij dit recht toch behouden. In dat geval is artikel 18, eerste, derde, vierde, vijfde, zesde en zevende lid, van overeenkomstige toepassing.

### Artikel  18

Een persoon die voldoet aan de voorwaarden voor aanspraak op prestaties krachtens de wetgeving van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft aanspraak op die prestaties gedurende een tijdelijk verblijf op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij wanneer zijn toestand onmiddellijke medische verzorging noodzakelijk maakt.   
2.  een persoon die aanspraak heeft op prestaties ten laste van een orgaan van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen en die woont op het grondgebied van die Partij, behoudt die aanspraak wanneer hij zijn woonplaats overbrengt naar het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Voor de overbrenging dient de belanghebbende echter de toestemming van het bevoegde orgaan te verkrijgen. Die toestemming mag alleen worden geweigerd indien is vastgesteld dat verplaatsing van de belanghebbende zijn gezondheidstoestand of het ondergaan van medische behandeling zou schaden.   
3.  Wanneer een persoon aanspraak heeft op verstrekkingen overeenkomstig het in de voorgaande leden bepaalde, worden deze verstrekkingen verleend ten laste van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan in de tijdelijke verblijfplaats of de woonplaats overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de wetgeving die door laatstgenoemd orgaan wordt toegepast, alsof de belanghebbende daarbij was aangesloten. Het tijdvak gedurende welke dergelijke prestaties worden verleend is echter die welke is vastgelegd krachtens de wetgeving van de bevoegde staat.   
4.  In de in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen is de levering van prothesen, hulpmiddelen van grotere omvang of andere belangrijke verstrekkingen, behalve in zeer urgente gevallen, onderworpen aan de voorwaarde dat het bevoegde orgaan toestemming verleent.   
5.  In de in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen worden uitkeringen door het bevoegde orgaan verstrekt overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de wetgeving die dit orgaan toepast.

7.  Het in het eerste en zesde lid van dit artikel bepaalde is niet van toepassing op personen die naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde staat gaan om een medische behandeling te ondergaan.   

### Artikel  19  

####Verstrekkingen voor gepensioneerden en hun gezinsleden

1.  Wanneer een persoon die pensioenen ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen aanspraak heeft op verstrekkingen krachtens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, worden aan hem en zijn gezinsleden door het orgaan van de woonplaats en ten laste van dit orgaan verstrekkingen verleend, alsof hij uitsluitend krachtens de wetgeving van laatstbedoelde Partij gepensioneerde was.   
2.  Wanneer een persoon die een pensioen ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij woont op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en hij geen aanspraak heeft op verstrekkingen krachtens de wetgeving van laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij, verleent het orgaan van zijn woonplaats overeenkomstig de door dit orgaan toegepaste wetgeving en ten laste van het bevoegde orgaan, deze persoon en zijn gezinsleden verstrekkingen waarop deze persoon aanspraak heeft krachtens de wetgeving van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij of waarop hij aanspraak zou hebben indien hij op het grondgebied van die Verdragsluitende Partij zou wonen.   
3.  Wanneer de gezinsleden van een persoon die een pensioen ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij of pensioenen krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen dan de gepensioneerde, ontvangen zij verstrekkingen alsof de gepensioneerde op hetzelfde grondgebied als zij woonde, voor zover hij krachtens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij aanspraak op verstrekkingen heeft. Deze verstrekkingen worden ten laste van het bevoegde orgaan door het orgaan van de woonplaats van de gezinsleden verleend, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de door dit orgaan toegepaste wetgeving, alsof zij krachtens deze wetgeving recht op die verstrekkingen hadden.   
4.  Indien de in het vorige lid bedoelde gezinsleden hun woonplaats overbrengen naar het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop de gepensioneerde woont, hebben zij aanspraak op verstrekkingen in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van deze Partij, zelfs indien zij vóór de overbrenging van hun woonplaats reeds uitkeringen of verstrekkingen hebben ontvangen voor hetzelfde geval van ziekte of moederschap.   
5.  Een persoon die een pensioen ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij en aanspraak heeft op verstrekkingen krachtens de wetgeving van deze Verdragsluitende Partij, heeft, evenals zijn gezinsleden, aanspraak op die verstrekkingen gedurende een tijdelijk verblijf op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen, wanneer hun gezondheidstoestand het nodig maakt dat die verstrekkingen onmiddellijk worden verleend.   
6.  In het in het vorige lid bedoelde geval worden de verstrekkingen verleend ten laste van het orgaan van de woonplaats van de gepensioneerde of de gezinsleden, door het orgaan van de tijdelijke verblijfplaats, overeenkomstig de wetgeving daarvan, alsof de belanghebbende krachtens deze wetgeving recht op die verstrekkingen had. Het tijdvak gedurende welk verstrekkingen worden verleend is echter dat welk is vastgelegd krachtens de wetgeving van de woonstaat. Het in artikel 18, vierde lid, bepaalde is van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
7.  Wanneer de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij bepaalt dat premies of bijdragen moeten worden afgetrokken van het te betalen pensioen in verband met de aanspraak op verstrekkingen, is het orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij dat het pensioen betaalt, bevoegd deze bedragen in te houden, indien krachtens dit artikel de kosten van verstrekkingen worden gedragen door een orgaan van die Verdragsluitende Partij.   
8.  Het in dit artikel bepaalde is niet van toepassing op gezinsleden die aanspraak hebben op verstrekkingen krachtens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen vanwege betaalde werkzaamheden of omdat zij een socialezekerheidsuitkering ontvangen van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen.   
9.  Het in het vijfde lid van dit artikel bepaalde is niet van toepassing op personen die naar het grondgebied gaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die op het grondgebied waarvan zij wonen voor het ondergaan van een medische behandeling.   

### Artikel  20  

####Berekening van de Sloveense moederschapsuitkering

Indien overeenkomstig de Sloveense wetgeving het bedrag van een moederschapsuitkering wordt berekend op de grondslag van het laatst genoten salaris van de verzekerde persoon, dient het Sloveense bevoegde orgaan uitsluitend het salaris in aanmerking te nemen dat door de verzekerde persoon is ontvangen gedurende zijn laatste dienstbetrekking in Slovenië, waarbij het gemiddelde in Slovenië ontvangen salaris van de verzekerde persoon wordt aangehouden als het gemiddelde salaris van het gehele voorgeschreven tijdvak.  

### Artikel  21  

####Vergoedingen tussen organen onderling

1.  De verstrekkingen die overeenkomstig dit hoofdstuk zijn verleend, worden door de bevoegde organen of, indien van toepassing, door de organen van de woonplaats vergoed aan de organen die deze verstrekkingen hebben verleend.   
2.  De vergoedingen worden vastgesteld en vinden plaats op de wijze welke is geregeld in het Administratief Akkoord als bedoeld in artikel 36, hetzij door het aantonen van de werkelijke uitgaven, hetzij op grond van vaste bedragen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####GEMEENSCHAPPELIJKE BEPALINGEN INZAKE ARBEIDSONGESCHIKTHEID, OUDERDOM EN OVERLIJDEN

### Artikel  22  

Wanneer, krachtens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij niet aan de voorwaarden voor verkrijgen, behouden of herstellen van het recht op een prestatie wordt voldaan uitsluitend op basis van verzekeringstijdvakken die krachtens deze wetgeving zijn vervuld, houdt het bevoegde orgaan voor het voldoen aan deze voorwaarden ook rekening met verzekeringstijdvakken die zijn vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, tenzij de tijdvakken elkaar overlappen.  

### Artikel  23  

Geen recht op een pensioen overeenkomstig de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij bestaat indien het krachtens deze wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvak korter is dan 12 maanden. Dit is niet van toepassing indien het recht op pensioen alleen bestaat op basis van dit verzekeringstijdvak.  

####UITVOERING VAN DE SLOVEENSE WETGEVING

### Artikel  24  

1.  Indien aan de voorwaarden voor toekenning van het recht op een prestatie krachtens de Sloveense wetgeving wordt voldaan ook zonder bijtelling van in beide Verdragsluitende Staten vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken, verleent het bevoegde orgaan in Slovenië de prestatie uitsluitend op basis van krachtens de Sloveense wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken.   
2.  Ingeval een persoon slechts voldoet aan de voor de toekenning van prestaties vereiste voorwaarden indien artikel 22 in aanmerking wordt genomen, berekent het bevoegde orgaan eerst de theoretische som van de prestatie waarop een persoon aanspraak zou hebben alsof het gehele krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen in aanmerking genomen verzekeringstijdvak was vervuld krachtens de voor hem relevante wetgeving. Indien de som van de prestatie niet afhankelijk is van het verzekeringstijdvak, wordt deze beschouwd als de theoretische som.   
3.  Op basis van de som uit het voorgaande lid berekent het bevoegde orgaan het werkelijke bedrag van een prestatie die het verplicht is uit te betalen met betrekking tot de duur van het krachtens de voor dit orgaan relevante wetgeving in aanmerking te nemen verzekeringstijdvak en het gehele verzekeringstijdvak dat in aanmerking dient te worden genomen krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen.   

### Artikel  25  

1.  Ter uitvoering van artikel 24, tweede lid, wordt voor het vaststellen van de pensioengrondslag overeenkomstig de Sloveense wetgeving uitsluitend de Sloveense pensioengrondslag in aanmerking genomen.   
2.  Indien bij het uitvoeren van artikel 24, derde lid, het gehele verzekeringstijdvak dat in aanmerking wordt genomen krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, het maximaal mogelijke verzekeringstijdvak overschrijdt dat overeenkomstig de Sloveense wetgeving is vastgesteld voor het bepalen van de prestaties, wordt het naar evenredigheid uit te betalen pensioen berekend als een verhouding tussen het verzekeringstijdvak krachtens de Sloveense wetgeving en het bovengenoemde maximaal mogelijke aantal verzekeringsmaanden.   

####UITVOERING VAN DE NEDERLANDSE WETGEVING

### Artikel  26  

Wanneer een persoon, op het tijdstip waarop de arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ontstaan, onderworpen was aan de Sloveense wetgeving inzake pensioenen en aanspraak had op een Sloveense invaliditeitsuitkering, en hij voordien verzekeringstijdvakken had vervuld krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving inzake invaliditeitsverzekering, heeft hij aanspraak op een uitkering krachtens laatstgenoemde wetgeving, berekend volgens de regels van artikel 27.  

### Artikel  27  

1.  Het bedrag van de in artikel 26 bedoelde uitkering wordt berekend naar verhouding van de totale duur van de door de belanghebbende na het bereiken van de leeftijd van 15 jaar krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken tot het tijdvak gelegen tussen de datum waarop hij de leeftijd van 15 jaar bereikte en de datum waarop zijn arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ontstaan.   
2.  Indien de belanghebbende, op het tijdstip dat de arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ontstaan, werknemer was of met een werknemer was gelijkgesteld, wordt de verschuldigde uitkering vastgesteld overeenkomstig de Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (WAO) van 18 februari 1966. Indien dit niet het geval is, wordt de verschuldigde uitkering vastgesteld overeenkomstig de Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering Zelfstandigen (WAZ) van 24 april 1997.   
3.  Als verzekeringstijdvakken, vervuld krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving worden aangemerkt: 

a. verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (WAO) van 18 februari 1966;  

b. verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de Algemene Arbeidsongeschiktheidswet van 11 december 1975 (AAW);  

c. verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering Zelfstandigen van 24 april 1997 (WAZ);  

d. tijdvakken van arbeid en daarmee gelijkgestelde tijdvakken die vóór 1 juli 1967 in Nederland zijn vervuld.     
4.  In het geval bedoeld in de eerste volzin van het tweede lid van dit artikel wordt, wanneer een verzekeringstijdvak vervuld krachtens de WAO samenvalt met een verzekeringstijdvak vervuld krachtens de AAW, alleen rekening gehouden met het krachtens de WAO vervulde tijdvak.   
5.  In het geval bedoeld in de tweede volzin van het tweede lid van dit artikel wordt, wanneer een verzekeringstijdvak vervuld krachtens de AAW samenvalt met een verzekeringstijdvak vervuld krachtens de WAO, alleen rekening gehouden met het krachtens de AAW vervulde tijdvak.   

### Artikel  28  

####Bepalingen inzake het Nederlandse ouderdomspensioen

1.  In geval van ouderdom stelt het Nederlandse verzekeringsorgaan het pensioen rechtstreeks en uitsluitend vast op basis van de krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving inzake ouderdomsverzekering vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken.   
2.  De in artikel 13, eerste lid, van de Algemene Ouderdomswet (AOW) bedoelde korting wordt niet toegepast op kalenderjaren of delen daarvan vóór de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag gedurende welke een gehuwde vrouw of een weduwe tussen haar vijftiende en vijfenzestigste levensjaar, en wonend in Slovenië, niet verzekerd was krachtens bovengenoemde wet voor zover de kalenderjaren of delen daarvan samenvallen met door haar echtgenoot gedurende hun huwelijk krachtens die wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken. In afwijking van artikel 7 van de AOW wordt een dergelijke vrouw beschouwd als rechthebbende op een pensioen.   
3.  De in artikel 13, tweede lid, van de AOW bedoelde korting wordt niet toegepast op kalenderjaren of delen daarvan vóór de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag gedurende welke de gehuwde vrouw van de gepensioneerde in Slovenië woonde tussen haar vijftiende en vijfenzestigste levensjaar, en niet verzekerd was krachtens bovengenoemde wetgeving voor zover de kalenderjaren of delen daarvan samenvallen met door haar echtgenoot gedurende hun huwelijk krachtens die wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken.   
4.  De bepalingen bedoeld in het tweede en het derde lid van dit artikel worden uitsluitend toegepast indien de belanghebbende gedurende zes jaar op het grondgebied van Slovenië of Nederland heeft gewoond na het bereiken van de leeftijd van 59 jaar en voor de duur dat die persoon op het grondgebied van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen woont.   
5.  In afwijking van het bepaalde in artikel 45, eerste lid, van de Algemene Ouderdomswet (AOW), en artikel 63, eerste lid, van de Algemene Nabestaandenwet (ANW), is de echtgenoot/echtgenote van een werknemer die valt onder de verplichte verzekeringsregeling en woont in Slovenië gerechtigd krachtens die wetgeving een vrijwillige verzekering af te sluiten, maar slechts voor de tijdvakken na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag gedurende welke de werknemer verplicht verzekerd is of was krachtens bovengenoemde wetgeving. Dit recht vervalt op de datum van beëindiging van de verplichte verzekering van de werknemer. Bovengenoemd recht vervalt echter niet wanneer de verplichte verzekering van de werknemer wordt beëindigd als gevolg van zijn overlijden en wanneer zijn weduwe uitsluitend een pensioen krachtens de Nederlandse Algemene Nabestaandenwet (ANW) ontvangt. Het recht inzake vrijwillige verzekering vervalt in elk geval op de datum waarop de vrijwillig verzekerde de leeftijd van 65 jaar bereikt. De premie die dient te worden betaald voor bovengenoemde vrijwillige verzekering wordt voor de echtgenoot/echtgenote van een werknemer die verplicht verzekerd is krachtens de AOW en de ANW vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen inzake de vaststelling van de premie voor de verplichte verzekering, mits zijn of haar inkomsten geacht worden in Nederland te zijn genoten. Voor de echtgenoot/echtgenote van een werknemer die verplicht verzekerd was op of na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag wordt de premie vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen inzake de vaststelling van de premie voor vrijwillige verzekering krachtens de AOW en de ANW.   
6.  Het in het vijfde lid van dit artikel bedoelde recht wordt alleen toegekend indien de echtgenoot/echtgenote van een werknemer de Sociale Verzekeringsbank uiterlijk een jaar na aanvang van het tijdvak van de verplichte verzekering in kennis heeft gesteld van het voornemen een vrijwillige verzekering af te sluiten. Voor de echtgenoot/echtgenote van een werknemer die verplicht verzekerd was onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan of op de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, vangt de periode van een jaar aan op de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag.   
7.  De in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde bepalingen zijn niet van toepassing op tijdvakken die samenvallen met tijdvakken die in aanmerking kunnen worden genomen voor de berekening van pensioenrechten krachtens de wetgeving die van toepassing is op ouderdomspensioenen in een andere staat dan Nederland, of voor tijdvakken gedurende welke de belanghebbende een ouderdomspensioen ontving krachtens die wetgeving.   
8.  Het in het tweede en het derde lid van dit artikel bepaalde wordt alleen toegepast op de echtgenoot/echtgenote die een vrijwillige verzekering heeft afgesloten krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  29  

Wanneer een persoon op het tijdstip van zijn overlijden onderworpen was aan de Sloveense wetgeving inzake pensioenen en hij voordien verzekeringstijdvakken had vervuld krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving inzake algemene nabestaandenverzekering (ANW), hebben zijn nabestaanden aanspraak op een uitkering krachtens deze wetgeving, berekend in overeenstemming met de regels van artikel 30.  

### Artikel  30  

Het bedrag van de in artikel 29 bedoelde uitkering wordt berekend naar verhouding van de totale duur van de door de overledene voor het bereiken van de leeftijd van 65 jaar krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken tot het tijdvak gelegen tussen de datum waarop hij de leeftijd van 15 jaar bereikte en de datum van zijn overlijden, maar uiterlijk de datum waarop hij de leeftijd van 65 jaar bereikte.  

### HOOFSTUK  III  

####WERKLOOSHEID

### Artikel  31  

Indien de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen op een persoon van toepassing is geweest, worden de tijdvakken van verzekering of arbeid die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van beide Partijen in aanmerking moeten worden genomen bij elkaar opgeteld voor het verkrijgen, behouden of herstellen van het recht op werkloosheidsuitkeringen, voor zover deze tijdvakken niet samenvallen.  

### Artikel  32  

Een werknemer wonende op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij die zijn woonplaats overbrengt naar het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en laatstelijk was onderworpen aan de wetgeving van laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij heeft recht op een werkloosheidsuitkering krachtens de wetgeving van laatsgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij gedurende zijn verblijf op het grondgebied daarvan, indien: 

a. hij voldoet aan de voorwaarden van de wetgeving van die Partij, rekening houdend met de optelling van de in artikel 31 bedoelde verzekeringstijdvakken; en  

b. hij gedurende de laatste twaalf maanden voor indiening van de aanvraag in totaal ten minste vier weken op het grondgebied van die Partij als werknemer heeft gewerkt; en  

c. hij overeenkomstig de wetgeving inzake plaatsing van buitenlandse werknemers van die Partij een vergunning had om op het grondgebied van die Partij te werken.    

### Artikel  33  

Bij berekening van de uitkering in gevallen waarin dit hoofdstuk van toepassing is wordt alleen rekening gehouden met inkomsten die zijn genoten op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij die de uitkering betaalt.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####KINDERBIJSLAGEN

### Artikel  34  

1.  Een persoon die als werknemer werkt op het grondgebied van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij heeft recht op kinderbijslagen krachtens haar wetgeving zelfs indien het kind op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij woont.   
2.  Het eerste lid van dit artikel wordt toegepast zolang de Nederlandse wetgeving betaling van kinderbijslagen ten behoeve van kinderen wonende buiten het grondgebied van Nederland toestaat.   

### Artikel  35  

Indien aan de voorwaarden voor de aanspraak op kinderbijslagen is voldaan krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt de aanspraak op kinderbijslagen alleen toegekend krachtens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan het kind woont.  

### DEEL  IV  

####DIVERSE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  36  

####Administratief akkoord

De bevoegde autoriteiten komen bepalingen voor de uitvoering van dit Verdrag overeen door middel van een administratief akkoord. Voorts wijzen zij verbindingsorganen op hun onderscheiden grondgebieden aan om de uitvoering van dit Verdrag te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  37  

####Identificatie

Om aanspraak te hebben of te behouden op een uitkering overeenkomstig de Nederlandse wetgeving zijn een werknemer, een daarmee gelijkgesteld persoon en zijn nabestaanden, wonende in Slovenië, verplicht zich bij het bevoegde Sloveense orgaan te identificeren door middel van een officieel identiteitsbewijs. Het bevoegde Sloveense orgaan identificeert de persoon naar behoren op vertoon van zijn identiteitsbewijs. Een identiteitsbewijs is een paspoort of ander geldig identiteitsdocument dat is afgegeven door het bevoegde orgaan van de woonplaats. Het bevoegde Sloveense orgaan stelt het bevoegde Nederlandse orgaan door toezending van een kopie van het identiteitsbewijs ervan in kennis dat de identiteit naar behoren gecontroleerd is.  

### Artikel  38  

####Wederzijdse bijstand

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten doen elkaar mededeling van alle wijzigingen in hun wetgeving die van wezenlijk belang zijn voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag zijn de autoriteiten en verzekeringsorganen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen elkaar behulpzaam als betrof het de toepassing van hun eigen wetgeving. Deze wederzijdse administratieve bijstand wordt kosteloos verleend.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag kunnen de autoriteiten en verzekeringsorganen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar en met de belanghebbenden of hun vertegenwoordigers in verbinding stellen.   
4.  De autoriteiten, verzekeringsorganen en rechterlijke instanties van een Verdragsluitende Partij mogen aanvragen of andere documenten die bij hun worden ingediend niet afwijzen op grond van het feit dat zij in een vreemde taal zijn gesteld, mits deze de officiële taal van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij of de Engelse taal is.   

### Artikel  39  

####Verificatie van aanvragen en betalingen

1.  Het bevoegde orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarbij een aanvraag om prestaties is ingediend, controleert de juistheid van de gegevens betreffende de aanvrager en zijn gezinsleden en verschaft het bewijsmateriaal en de andere documentatie die nodig kunnen zijn voor het orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij voor verdere behandeling van de aanvraag.   
2.  Het eerste lid van dit artikel is van overeenkomstige toepassing indien het bevoegde orgaan van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen een verzoek indient om verificatie van de gegevens bij het orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij met het oog op het vaststellen van de rechtmatigheid van betalingen aan de gepensioneerden die op het grondgebied van de onderscheiden Verdragsluitende Partijen wonen.   
3.  De in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde gegevens omvatten tevens gegevens over inkomen, gezinssituatie en gezondheidstoestand.   
4.  De bevoegde organen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar en met hun onderscheiden gepensioneerden of hun vertegenwoordigers in verbinding stellen.

### Artikel  40  

####Taal

De bevoegde autoriteiten, verbindingsorganen en verzekeringsorganen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen corresponderen met elkaar in de Engelse of de Franse taal.  

### Artikel  41  

####Vrijstelling van kosten

Iedere vrijstelling van zegelrecht, notariële kosten of registratiekosten die op het grondgebied van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen is verleend met betrekking tot verklaringen en documenten die bij autoriteiten en verzekeringsorganen op dat grondgebied dienen te worden ingediend, geldt ook voor verklaringen en documenten die voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag dienen te worden ingediend bij autoriteiten en verzekeringsorganen op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Documenten en verklaringen die voor de uitvoering van dit Verdrag dienen te worden overgelegd, zijn vrijgesteld van legalisering door diplomatieke of consulaire autoriteiten.  

### Artikel  42  

####Indiening van aanvragen, beroepschriften en andere documenten

1.  Aanvragen, beroepschriften en andere documenten die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij binnen een bepaalde termijn dienen te worden ingediend bij een autoriteit of verzekeringsorgaan zijn ontvankelijk indien zij binnen dezelfde termijn worden ingediend bij een overeenkomstige autoriteit of overeenkomstig verzekeringsorgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. De autoriteit of het verzekeringsorgaan van laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij doet deze onverwijld toekomen aan de autoriteit of het verzekeringsorgaan van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij. De datum waarop deze documenten zijn ingediend bij de autoriteit of het verzekeringsorgaan van laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij wordt beschouwd als datum van indiening bij de autoriteit of het verzekeringsorgaan van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij.   
2.  Een aanvraag om een prestatie die is ingediend in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij wordt beschouwd als een aanvraag om de overeenkomstige prestatie krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Ten aanzien van ouderdomspensioenen geldt dit evenwel niet indien de aanvrager stelt of indien volkomen duidelijk is dat de aanvraag uitsluitend betrekking heeft op een pensioen krachtens de wetgeving van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  43  

####Munteenheid

1.  Wanneer een verzekeringsorgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens dit Verdrag uitkeringen verschuldigd is aan een rechthebbende die zich op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij bevindt, wordt het verschuldigde bedrag uitgedrukt in de munteenheid van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij. Dat orgaan kan het verschuldigde geldig voldoen in de munteenheid van de tweede Verdragsluitende Partij.   
2.  Wanneer een verzekeringsorgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens dit Verdrag betalingen verschuldigd is aan een verzekeringsorgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt het verschuldigde bedrag uitgedrukt in de munteenheid van laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij. Eerstgenoemd verzekeringsorgaan kan het verschuldigde geldig voldoen in die munteenheid.   
3.  De uit de toepassing van dit Verdrag voortvloeiende overmaking van gelden geschiedt in overeenstemming met de overeenkomsten die op de datum van overmaking ter zake tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen van kracht zijn.   
4.  Ingeval door een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen valutabeperkingen worden toegepast, komen beide Verdragsluitende Partijen onmiddellijk de nodige maatregelen overeen om de overmaking tussen de grondgebieden van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen van bedragen die ingevolge dit Verdrag betaalbaar zijn, te verzekeren.   
5.  Ingeval de Nederlandse en de Sloveense munteenheid onderling niet convertibel zijn, worden de betalingen tussen organen voor de toepassing van artikelen 21 van dit Verdrag en artikel 30 van het Administratief Akkoord berekend op basis van de indicatieve wisselkoers die op de datum waarop de betaling kan worden verricht geldt, als geadviseerd door De Nederlandsche Bank.   
6.  Ingeval de Nederlandse en de Sloveense munteenheid onderling niet convertibel zijn, worden de onverschuldigde betalingen of de premies of bijdragen voor de toepassing van de artikelen 44 en 45 berekend op basis van de indicatieve wisselkoers als geadviseerd door De Nederlandsche Bank op de datum vermeld voor de uitvoering van het besluit ten aanzien van het verhaal van onverschuldigde betalingen en ten aanzien van de inning van premies of bijdragen.   

### Artikel  44  

####Verhaal van onverschuldigde betalingen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen erkennen elkaars bestuurlijke of gerechtelijke beslissingen inzake het verhaal van onverschuldigde betalingen die zijn genomen krachtens hun wetgeving, mits tegen die beslissingen geen beroep meer openstaat bij een nationale rechter.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen elkaar behulpzaam zijn bij de uitvoering van beslissingen als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  Op verzoek van een bevoegd orgaan zal het andere orgaan bestuurlijke of gerechtelijke procedures entameren om de beslissingen als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel uit te voeren. De kosten van deze procedures worden vergoed door het verzoekende orgaan.   
4.  Indien, bij het toekennen of herzien van uitkeringen wegens invaliditeit, ouderdom of overlijden ingevolge het Verdrag, het bevoegde orgaan van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij een uitkeringsgerechtigde een bedrag heeft betaald dat hoger is dan het bedrag waarop hij recht heeft, kan dat orgaan het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij dat verantwoordelijk is voor de betaling van overeenkomstige uitkeringen aan die gerechtigde verzoeken het te veel betaalde bedrag in mindering te brengen op de nog verschuldigde bedragen die het aan genoemde gerechtigde betaalt. Het laatstgenoemde bevoegde orgaan draagt het in mindering gebrachte bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft. Wanneer het te veel betaalde bedrag niet in mindering kan worden gebracht op de nog verschuldigde bedragen is het in het vijfde lid van dit artikel bepaalde van toepassing.   
5.  Wanneer een bevoegd orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij een uitkeringsgerechtigde een bedrag heeft betaald dat hoger is dan het bedrag waarop hij recht heeft, kan dat orgaan, onder de voorwaarden en binnen de grenzen neergelegd in de wetgeving die het uitvoert, het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij dat verantwoordelijk is voor de betaling van uitkeringen aan die gerechtigde verzoeken het te veel betaalde bedrag in mindering te brengen op de bedragen die het aan genoemde gerechtigde betaalt. Het laatstgenoemde orgaan past de mindering toe onder de voorwaarden en binnen de grenzen die voor een dergelijke compensatie in de wetgeving die het uitvoert zijn voorzien, alsof de te hoge bedragen door dit orgaan zelf waren betaald, en draagt het in mindering gebrachte bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft.   

### Artikel  45  

####Inning van premies of bijdragen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen erkennen elkaars beslissingen inzake inning van premies of bijdragen die zijn genomen krachtens hun wetgeving, mits tegen die beslissingen geen beroep meer openstaat bij een nationale rechter.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen elkaar behulpzaam zijn bij de uitvoering van de beslissingen als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  Op verzoek van een bevoegd orgaan zal het andere orgaan juridische procedures entameren om de beslissingen als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel uit te voeren. De kosten van deze procedures worden vergoed door het verzoekende orgaan.   

### Artikel  46

Indien de methode voor het vaststellen van prestaties of de regels voor de berekening van prestaties echter dienen te worden gewijzigd, bijvoorbeeld vanwege een stijging in de kosten van levensonderhoud of veranderingen in de hoogte van lonen of salarissen of andere redenen voor aanpassing of nieuwe feiten of omstandigheden die de prestaties beïnvloeden in overweging dienen te worden genomen, wordt een herberekening uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag.

Ter verkrijging van de toestemming waarvan de verlening van de prestaties bedoeld in artikel 18, vierde lid, van het Verdrag afhankelijk is, verzoekt het orgaan van de woonplaats of van de tijdelijke verblijfplaats het bevoegde orgaan daarom. Het laatstgenoemde orgaan heeft vijftien dagen vanaf de dag waarop een dergelijk verzoek is ontvangen, om hiertegen bezwaar maken en de gronden te vermelden waarop dit bezwaar berust. Indien na afloop van die termijn geen bezwaar is gemaakt, kent het orgaan van de woonplaats of van de tijdelijke verblijfplaats de verstrekkingen toe.   
3.  Wanneer de in artikel 18, vierde lid, van het Verdrag bedoelde verstrekkingen in zeer urgente gevallen zonder toestemming van het bevoegde orgaan moeten worden toegekend, stelt het orgaan van de woonplaats of van de tijdelijke verblijfplaats het bevoegde orgaan hiervan onmiddellijk op de hoogte.   
4.  De zeer urgente gevallen bedoeld in artikel 18, vierde lid, van het Verdrag zijn die gevallen waarin het verlenen van de verstrekking niet kan worden uitgesteld zonder het leven of de gezondheid van de belanghebbende ernstig in gevaar te brengen. In het geval waarin een prothese of een kunstmiddel is gebroken of beschadigd, is het om de grote urgentie vast te stellen voldoende, de noodzaak van het herstel of de vernieuwing van het desbetreffende benodigde middel aan te tonen.

5.  Het orgaan van de woonplaats stelt, zodra het kennis krijgt van enige wijziging die van invloed is op de omvang van de aanspraak op verstrekkingen van de gepensioneerde of zijn gezinsleden, het bevoegde orgaan op de hoogte.   
6.  Het orgaan van de woonplaats is het bevoegde orgaan behulpzaam bij het treffen van maatregelen tegen een persoon die prestaties heeft ontvangen die niet aan hem verschuldigd waren.

4.
