### DEEL  B  

####CAPACITEIT EN FREQUENTIE

### 1  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van elk van beide Partijen heeft het recht drie (3) wekelijkse diensten te exploiteren met ieder type luchtvaartuig in alle klassen, ten einde zonder onderscheid vluchten met combitoestellen, passagiers-vrachtvluchten en postvluchten in te stellen, en/of vluchten met alleen vracht, op de in de routetabel omschreven vluchten.  

### 2  

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Argentinië heeft het recht haar drie wekelijkse diensten te exploiteren met gebruik van hetzij uitsluitend haar eigen vluchtnummer (code), hetzij in „code sharing” met Iberia, hetzij een combinatie van beide mogelijkheden. Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Argentinië uitsluitend werkt in „code sharing” met Iberia, heeft de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Argentinië het recht vijf wekelijkse diensten te exploiteren. Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van Argentinië werkt met een combinatie van beide mogelijkheden, is het volgende van toepassing:
