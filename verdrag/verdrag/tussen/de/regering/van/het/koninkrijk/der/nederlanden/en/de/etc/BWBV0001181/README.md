### Article  13  

####Aviation Security

1.  Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties reaffirm that their obligations to each other to protect the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference forms an integral part of the present Agreement. Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall in particular act in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, done at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, done at the Hague on 16 December 1970 and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on 23 September 1971.   
2.  The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance in accordance with their respective laws and regulations to each other to prevent acts against the safety of aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.   
3.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization and designated as Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties, and they shall require that their airlines and the operators of airports in their territory act in conformity with such security provisions.   
4.  Each Contracting Party agrees that such airlines may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 above required by the other Contracting Party for entry into, departure from, or while within the territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures within its territory to protect the aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew, carry-on items, baggage, cargo and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading. Each Contracting Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigations facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.   
6.  The Contracting Parties shall act in accordance with the applicable aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Should a Contracting Party depart from such provisions, the other Contracting Party may request consultations with that Contracting Party. Unless otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties, such consultations shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement could constitute grounds for the application of Article 15 of this Agreement.   

### Article  14  

####Consultation

In a spirit of close co-operation the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties shall consult each other from time to time with a view to ensuring the implementation of, and satisfactory compliance with, the provisions of the present Agreement and of its Annex and shall also consult when necessary to provide for modification thereof. Either Contracting Party may request consultation, which may be through discussion or by correspondence and shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days of the date of the request, unless both Contracting Parties agree to an extension of this period.  

### Article  15  

####Settlement of Disputes

1.  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation.   
2.  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, the dispute may, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each Contracting Party and the third to be agreed upon by the two arbitrators so chosen, provided that the third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting Party. The third arbitrator shall act as President of the arbitral tribunal. Each of the Contracting Parties shall designate an arbitrator within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other Contracting Party of a diplomatic note requesting arbitration of the dispute and the third arbitrator shall be agreed upon within a further period of sixty (60) days. If either Contracting Party fails to designate its own arbitrator within the period of sixty (60) days, or if the third arbitrator is not agreed upon within the period indicated, the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization may, at request of either Contracting Party, appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators as the case requires.   
3.  The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision given under paragraph 2 of this Article.   
4.  The expenses of the national arbitrators shall be borne by the respective Contracting Parties. All other expenses of the arbitral tribunal, including the fees and expenses of the third arbitrators shall be shared equally.   

### Article  16  

####Modification of the Agreement

If either of the Contracting Parties considers it desirable to modify any provision of the present Agreement, it may request consultation with the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 14.
