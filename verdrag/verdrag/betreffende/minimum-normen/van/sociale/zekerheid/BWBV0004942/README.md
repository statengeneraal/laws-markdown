Ten aanzien van elke periodieke uitkering, waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens het door verzekering gedekte geval verstrekte kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn, dat het voor de model-gerechtigde, bedoeld in de bij dit Deel gevoegde tabel, ten minste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor het onderhavige geval aangegeven percentage van het totaal van de vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner en van het bedrag van de kinderbijslag, verstrekt aan een beschermd persoon, die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als de model-gerechtigde.   
2.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner moeten overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen worden berekend; wanneer de beschermde personen of hun kostwinners zijn ingedeeld in klassen naar hun inkomsten uit arbeid kunnen de vroegere inkomsten worden berekend naar het basisinkomen van de klasse, waartoe de betrokkenen hebben behoord.   
3.  Het bedrag van de uitkering of het arbeidsinkomen, dat als basis voor de berekening van de uitkering wordt genomen, kan aan een maximum worden gebonden, mits dit maximum zodanig wordt vastgesteld, dat voldaan wordt aan de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel wanneer het vroegere arbeidsinkomen van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner minder bedraagt dan of gelijk is aan dat van een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider.   
4.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner, het loon van de geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkering en elke kinderbijslag zullen worden berekend naar dezelfde tijd-basis.   
5.  Voor de andere gerechtigden zullen de uitkeringen zodanig worden vastgesteld, dat zij in een redelijke verhouding staan tot die van een model-gerechtigde.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel zal als geschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden aangemerkt: 

a) een bankwerker of een draaier in de mechanische industrie, met uitzondering van de vervaardiging van electrische apparaten; of  

b) een geschoolde arbeider, zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid; of  

c) een persoon, wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan of meer bedraagt dan het arbeidsinkomen van 75 procent van alle beschermde personen, waarbij dat arbeidsinkomen wordt bepaald over een tijdvak van een jaar of over een korter tijdvak naargelang zal worden voorgeschreven; of  

d) een persoon, wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan 125 procent van het gemiddelde arbeidsinkomen van alle beschermde personen.     
7.  De geschoolde arbeider, zoals bedoeld in alinea *b)* van het vorige lid, zal worden gekozen uit de klasse, die het grootste aantal tegen het door verzekering gedekte geval beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen omvat, in de bedrijfstak, die het grootste aantal van deze beschermde personen of van die kostwinners telt; daarbij moet gebruik worden gemaakt van de internationale industriële standaard-classificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 Augustus 1948 en die als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is toegevoegd, zulks met inachtneming van de wijzigingen, welke daarin later eventueel worden aangebracht.   
8.  Wanneer de uitkeringen van streek tot streek verschillen kan voor elke streek een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 6 en 7 van dit artikel.   
9.  Het loon van een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van de eventuele duurtetoeslagen, zal worden bepaald naar de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het achtste lid van dit artikel niet wordt toegepast, zal men het gemiddelde loon als grondslag nemen.   
10.  De bedragen van lopende periodieke betalingen terzake van ouderdom, arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten (met uitzondering van die terzake van ongeschiktheid tot werken), invaliditeit of overlijden van de kostwinner, worden herzien bij aanmerkelijke veranderingen in het algemeen loonpeil, welke het gevolg zijn van aanmerkelijke veranderingen in de kosten van levensonderhoud.   

### Artikel  66  

1.  Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling, waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens het door verzekering gedekte geval verstrekte kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn, dat het voor de model-gerechtigde, bedoeld in de bij dit Deel gevoegde tabel, ten minste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor het desbetreffende geval aangegeven percentage van het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de kinderbijslag, verleend aan een beschermd persoon, die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als de model-gerechtigde.   
2.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkeringen en de kinderbijslag worden berekend naar dezelfde basis-tijdvakken.   
3.  Voor de andere gerechtigden zullen de uitkeringen zodanig worden vastgesteld, dat zij in een redelijke verhouding staan tot die van de model-gerechtigde.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel zal als ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden aangemerkt: 

a) een ongeschoolde arbeider in de mechanische industrie, met uitzondering van de vervaardiging van electrische apparaten; of  

b) een ongeschoolde arbeider, zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid.     
5.  De ongeschoolde arbeider, bedoeld in alinea *b)* van het vorige lid, zal worden gekozen uit de klasse, die het grootste aantal tegen het door verzekering gedekte geval beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen omvat, in de bedrijfstak, die het grootste aantal van deze beschermde personen of van die kostwinners telt; daarbij moet gebruik worden gemaakt van de internationale industriële standaard-classificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 Augustus 1948 en die als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is toegevoegd, zulks met inachtneming van de wijzigingen, welke daarin later eventueel worden aangebracht.   
6.  Wanneer de uitkeringen van streek tot streek verschillen kan voor elke streek een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 4 en 5 van dit artikel.   
7.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van de eventuele duurtetoeslagen, zal worden bepaald naar de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het zesde lid van dit artikel geen toepassing heeft gevonden, zal men het gemiddelde loon als grondslag nemen.   
8.  De bedragen van lopende periodieke betalingen terzake van ouderdom, arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten (met uitzondering van die terzake van ongeschiktheid tot werken), invaliditeit of overlijden van de kostwinner, worden herzien bij aanmerkelijke veranderingen in het algemeen loonpeil, welke het gevolg zijn van aanmerkelijke veranderingen in de kosten van levensonderhoud.   

### Artikel  67  

Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling, waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, gelden de volgende regelen: 

a) het bedrag van de uitkering moet worden vastgesteld naar een voorgeschreven tarief of naar een tarief, vastgesteld door het bevoegde overheidsorgaan overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen;  

b) het bedrag van de uitkering kan slechts worden verminderd in de mate waarmede de overige inkomsten van het gezin van de gerechtigde een aanzienlijk voorgeschreven of door het bevoegde overheidsorgaan overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen vastgesteld bedrag overtreffen;  

c) na aftrek van het aanzienlijk bedrag, bedoeld in alinea *b)*, moet het totaal van de uitkering en van de overige inkomsten voldoende zijn om aan het gezin van de gerechtigde gezonde en passende levensvoorwaarden te verzekeren en mag het niet minder bedragen dan het bedrag van de uitkering, berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 66;  

d) aan het bepaalde in alinea *c)* wordt geacht te zijn voldaan indien het totaal bedrag van de krachtens het desbetreffende Deel betaalde uitkering ten minste 30 procent meer bedraagt dan het totaal bedrag der uitkeringen, dat men zou verkrijgen bij toepassing van de bepalingen van artikel 66 en van de bepalingen van: 

i) artikel 15, alinea *b)*, wat betreft Deel III;  

ii) artikel 27, alinea *b)*, wat betreft Deel V;  

iii) artikel 55, alinea *b)*, wat betreft Deel IX;

### DEEL  XII  

####Gelijkheid van behandeling van inwoners, die niet de nationaliteit van het Lid bezitten

### Artikel  68  

1.  Inwoners, die niet de nationaliteit van het Lid bezitten, moeten dezelfde rechten hebben als inwoners, die deze nationaliteit wel bezitten. Nochtans kunnen ten aanzien van uitkeringen of gedeelten van uitkeringen, welke uitsluitend of in hoofdzaak uit de openbare middelen worden bekostigd, alsmede ten aanzien van overgangsstelsels bijzondere bepalingen worden vastgesteld met betrekking tot vreemdelingen en tot eigen onderdanen, die buiten het grondgebied van het Lid zijn geboren.   
2.  Ten aanzien van stelsels van sociale zekerheid, welke op premiebetaling berusten en welke gelden voor loontrekkenden, moeten beschermde personen, die de nationaliteit bezitten van een Lid, dat de uit het desbetreffende Deel van het Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen heeft aanvaard, ten opzichte van dat Deel dezelfde rechten hebben als de eigen onderdanen van het betrokken Lid. Nochtans kan de toepassing van deze bepaling afhankelijk worden gesteld van het bestaan van een bilaterale of multilaterale wederkerigheidsovereenkomst.   

### DEEL  XIII  

####Gemeenschappelijke bepalingen

### Artikel  69  

Een uitkering, waarop een beschermd persoon recht zou hebben gehad op grond van een van de Delen II tot en met X van dit Verdrag, kan worden geschorst in een eventueel voor te schrijven mate: 

a) zolang de belanghebbende zich niet op het grondgebied van het Lid bevindt;  

b) zolang het onderhoud van de belanghebbende ten laste van de overheid of van een instelling of dienst van sociale zekerheid komt; nochtans moet, wanneer de uitkering de kosten van dat onderhoud te boven gaat, het verschil worden verstrekt aan de personen, die ten laste van de gerechtigde zijn;  

c) zolang de belanghebbende een andere sociale zekerheidsuitkering in geld ontvangt, met uitzondering van kinderbijslag, en gedurende enige periode, tijdens welke hij voor hetzelfde geval schadeloosstelling ontvangt van derden, met dien verstande, dat het deel van de uitkering, dat wordt geschorst, de andere uitkering of de door derden betaalde schadeloosstelling niet overtreft;  

d) wanneer de belanghebbende getracht heeft op bedrieglijke wijze een uitkering te verkrijgen;  

e) wanneer het geval veroorzaakt is door een door de belanghebbende gepleegd misdrijf;  

f) wanneer het geval veroorzaakt is door opzet van de belanghebbende;  

g) in daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen, wanneer de belanghebbende nalaat gebruik te maken van de geneeskundige of revalidatiediensten, welke te zijner beschikking staan, alsook wanneer hij de regelen niet nakomt, welke zijn voorgeschreven voor het vaststellen van het bestaan van het geval of voor de gedragingen van de gerechtigde;  

h) voor wat betreft de uitkering bij werkloosheid, wanneer de belanghebbende nalaat gebruik te maken van de diensten voor arbeidsbemiddeling, welke te zijner beschikking staan;  

i) voor wat de uitkering bij werkloosheid betreft, wanneer de belanghebbende werkloos is geworden als rechtstreeks gevolg van een stilstand in de arbeid tengevolge van een arbeidsconflict, dan wel wanneer hij vrijwillig zonder rechtmatige reden zijn werk heeft neergelegd;  

j) voor wat betreft de uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen, zolang de weduwe in concubinaat leeft.    

### Artikel  70  

1.  Een ieder, die aanspraak maakt op een uitkering, moet het recht hebben om beroep in te stellen, wanneer hem een uitkering wordt geweigerd of wanneer hij zich niet kan verenigen met de hoedanigheid of de omvang daarvan.   
2.  Wanneer bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag de verstrekking van de geneeskundige zorg is toevertrouwd aan een regeringsdepartement, dat verantwoording schuldig is aan een parlement, kan het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde recht van beroep worden vervangen door het recht om elk bezwaar tegen weigering van geneeskundige zorg of tegen de hoedanigheid der ontvangen geneeskundige zorg te doen onderzoeken door de bevoegde autoriteit.   
3.  Wanneer verzoeken om uitkering worden behandeld door rechtscolleges, welke speciaal zijn ingesteld voor de behandeling van zaken aangaande sociale zekerheid en waarin de beschermde personen vertegenwoordigd zijn, behoeft het recht van beroep niet te worden toegekend.   

### Artikel  71  

1.  De kosten van de op grond van dit Verdrag verleende uitkeringen en de aan die uitkeringen verbonden administratiekosten moeten collectief worden gedragen door middel van premiën of belastingen of door een combinatie van beide, op een zodanige wijze, dat personen van geringe draagkracht niet te zwaar belast worden en dat rekening wordt gehouden met de economische toestand van het Lid en van de groepen der beschermde personen.   
2.  Het totaal van de verzekeringspremiën ten laste van de beschermde loontrekkenden mag 50 procent van het totaal der inkomsten, nodig voor de bescherming van deze loontrekkenden, hun echtgenoten en kinderen, niet te boven gaan. Teneinde vast te stellen of aan deze voorwaarde is voldaan, mogen alle uitkeringen, welke door het Lid op grond van dit Verdrag worden verleend, in hun geheel in aanmerking worden genomen, met uitzondering van de kinderbijslagen en de uitkeringen terzake van arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten, indien deze laatste het voorwerp uitmaken van een afzonderlijke tak der verzekering.   
3.  Het Lid moet een algemene aansprakelijkheid op zich nemen voor de verstrekking van de uitkeringen, verleend op grond van dit Verdrag, en alle nodige maatregelen treffen om dit doel te bereiken; indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat moet het zich ervan vergewissen, dat de noodzakelijke actuariële studies en berekeningen betreffende het financiële evenwicht periodiek worden gemaakt, doch in elk geval vóór elke wijziging van de uitkeringen, van het tarief der verzekeringspremiën of der belastingen, bestemd voor de dekking van de desbetreffende gevallen.   

### Artikel  72  

1.  Wanneer de administratie niet wordt gevoerd door een op overheidsvoorschriften berustende instelling of door een regeringsdepartement, dat verantwoording schuldig is aan een parlement, moeten vertegenwoordigers van de beschermde personen deel nemen aan de administratie of met raadgevende stem daarbij betrokken worden onder daartoe gestelde voorwaarden; de nationale wetgeving kan eveneens bepalingen bevatten inzake de deelneming van vertegenwoordigers van de werkgevers en van de overheid.   
2.  Het Lid moet een algemene verantwoordelijkheid aanvaarden voor een goede administratie van de instellingen en diensten, die betrokken zijn bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag.   

### DEEL  XIV

### Artikel  74  

Dit Verdrag wordt geacht geen wijziging te brengen in enig bestaand Verdrag.  

### Artikel  75  

Wanneer zulks zal worden bepaald in een later door de Conferentie aangenomen Verdrag, hetwelk betrekking heeft op een of meer der in dit Verdrag behandelde onderwerpen, zullen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, welke in het nieuwe Verdrag zullen worden genoemd, ophouden van toepassing te zijn voor elk Lid, dat dit laatste Verdrag heeft bekrachtigd, zulks te rekenen van de datum waarop dit Verdrag ten opzichte van het betrokken Lid in werking is getreden.

2.  Een lid kan de zeelieden en de zeevissers buiten beschouwing laten bij de berekening van het aantal hetzij der loontrekkenden, hetzij der personen, behorende tot de werkende bevolking, hetzij der inwoners, dat in aanmerking wordt genomen voor de berekening van het percentage der loontrekkenden of der inwoners, die beschermd zijn op grond van een der Delen II tot en met X, voor zover die onder de bekrachtiging vallen.
