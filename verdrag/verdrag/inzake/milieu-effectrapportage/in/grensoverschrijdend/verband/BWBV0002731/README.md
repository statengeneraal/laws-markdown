### 1  

In considering proposed activities to which Article 2, paragraph 5, applies, the concerned Parties may consider whether the activity is likely to have a significant adverse transboundary impact in particular by virtue of one or more of the following criteria: 

a) Size: proposed activities which are large for the type of the activity;  

b) Location: proposed activities which are located in or close to an area of special environmental sensitivity or importance (such as wetlands designated under the Ramsar Convention, national parks, nature reserves, sites of special scientific interest, or sites of archaelogical, cultural or historical importance), also, proposed activities in locations where the characteristics of proposed development would be likely to have significant effects on the population;  

c) Effects: proposed activities with particularly complex and potentially adverse effects, including those giving rise to serious effects on humans or on valued species or organisms, those which threaten the existing or potential use of an affected area and those causing additional loading which cannot be sustained by the carrying capacity of the environment.    

### 2  

The concerned Parties shall consider for this purpose proposed activities which are located close to an international frontier as well as more remote proposed activities which could give rise to significant transboundary effects far removed from the site of development.  

### Appendix  IV  

####Inquiry procedure

### 1  

The requesting Party or Parties shall notify the secretariat that it or they submit(s) the question of whether a proposed activity listed in Appendix I is likely to have a significant adverse transboundary impact to an inquiry commission established in accordance with the provisions of this Appendix.

1.  De Partijen nemen, afzonderlijk of gezamenlijk, alle passende en doeltreffende maatregelen ter voorkoming, beperking en beheersing van belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende milieu-effecten van voorgenomen activiteiten.   
2.  Elke Partij neemt de nodige wettelijke, bestuurlijke of andere maatregelen ter uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag; onder meer stelt zij ten aanzien van in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteiten die mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect hebben, een milieu-effectrapportageprocedure vast, die deelneming door het publiek toelaat en voorziet in het opstellen van het in Aanhangsel II nader omschreven milieu-effectrapport.   
3.  De Partij van herkomst draagt er zorg voor dat in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag milieu-effectrapportage plaatsvindt vóór een besluit tot machtiging of uitvoering van een in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit die mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect heeft.   
4.  De Partij van herkomst draagt er overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag zorg voor dat de mogelijk benadeelde Partijen in kennis worden gesteld van het feit dat er sprake is van een in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit die mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect heeft.   
5.  Betrokken Partijen bespreken, op initiatief van een van hen, of een niet in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect heeft, en of zij derhalve moet worden behandeld alsof zij wel als zodanig wordt genoemd. Indien de Partijen dit overeenkomen, wordt deze activiteit als zodanig behandeld. Algemene richtsnoeren voor het kiezen van criteria om te bepalen of er al dan niet sprake is van een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect, worden gegeven in Aanhangsel III.   
6.

### Artikel  3  

####Kennisgeving

1.  Indien er sprake is van een in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit die mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect heeft, doet de Partij van herkomst hiervan, met het oog op voldoende en doeltreffend overleg zoals bedoeld in artikel 5, in een zo vroeg mogelijk stadium en niet later dan het tijdstip waarop zij haar eigen publiek over de voorgenomen activiteit informeert, kennisgeving aan iedere Partij die zij als mogelijk benadeelde Partij beschouwt.   
2.  Deze kennisgeving bevat onder meer: 

a. informatie over de voorgenomen activiteit, met inbegrip van alle beschikbare informatie over het mogelijke grensoverschrijdende effect ervan;  

b. een omschrijving van de aard van het te nemen besluit; en  

c. de vermelding van een redelijke termijn waarbinnen een antwoord krachtens het derde lid van dit artikel vereist is, de aard van de voorgestelde activiteit in aanmerking genomen;   en kan tevens de in het vijfde lid van dit artikel bedoelde informatie bevatten.   
3.  De mogelijk benadeelde Partij zendt de Partij van herkomst haar antwoord binnen de in de kennisgeving vermelde termijn; zij bevestigt de ontvangst van de kennisgeving en geeft aan of zij al dan niet voornemens is deel te nemen aan de milieu-effectrapportageprocedure.   
4.  Indien de mogelijk benadeelde Partij aangeeft dat zij niet voornemens is deel te nemen aan de milieu-effectrapportageprocedure, of indien zij niet binnen de in de kennisgeving aangeduide termijn een antwoord zendt, zijn de bepalingen van het vijfde, zesde, zevende en achtste lid van dit artikel en van de artikelen 4 tot en met 7 niet van toepassing. In deze omstandigheden blijft het recht van een Partij van herkomst om te bepalen of, op grond van haar nationale recht en praktijk, milieu-effectrapportage al dan niet moet plaatsvinden, onverminderd bestaan.   
5.  Zodra de Partij van herkomst van de mogelijk benadeelde Partij een antwoord ontvangt waarin deze aangeeft te willen deelnemen aan de milieu-effectrapportageprocedure, verstrekt de Partij van herkomst de mogelijk benadeelde Partij, indien zij dit niet reeds heeft gedaan: 

a. relevante informatie over de milieu-effectrapportageprocedure, waarin mede de termijn voor het indienen van commentaar wordt vermeld;  

b. relevante informatie over de voorgenomen activiteit en over het mogelijke belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende effect ervan.     
6.  Een mogelijk benadeelde Partij verstrekt de Partij van herkomst, indien deze daarom verzoekt, informatie, mits redelijkerwijs verkrijgbaar, over het mogelijk benadeelde milieu onder de rechtsmacht van de mogelijk benadeelde Partij, indien deze informatie vereist is voor het opstellen van het milieu-effectrapport. De informatie wordt onverwijld verstrekt, eventueel door tussenkomst van een gezamenlijk lichaam.   
7.  Wanneer een Partij van mening is dat zij een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect zou kunnen ondervinden van een in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit, en indien geen kennisgeving is gedaan in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel, wisselen de betrokken Partijen, op verzoek van de mogelijk benadeelde Partij, voldoende informatie uit voor het houden van besprekingen over de vraag of er mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect zal optreden. Indien die Partijen overeenkomen dat deze mogelijkheid aanwezig is, zijn de bepalingen van dit Verdrag dienovereenkomstig van toepassing. Indien de Partijen het niet eens kunnen worden over de vraag of er mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect zal optreden, kan elk van die Partijen deze vraag in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Aanhangsel IV voorleggen aan een onderzoekscommissie, met het vezoek om advies over de mogelijkheid dat een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect zal optreden, tenzij de Partijen een andere methode overeenkomen voor het oplossen van deze vraag.   
8.  De betrokken Partijen dragen er zorg voor dat het publiek van de mogelijk benadeelde Partij in de gebieden die het grensoverschrijdende effect mogelijk raakt, wordt geïnformeerd over de voorgenomen activiteit, en de gelegenheid wordt geboden commentaar te geven op of bezwaar te maken tegen de voorgenomen activiteit, en dit commentaar of bezwaar, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door tussenkomst van de Partij van herkomst, te doen toekomen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Partij van herkomst.   

### Artikel  4  

####Het opstellen van het milieu-effectrapport

1.  Het milieu-effectrapport dat bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Partij van herkomst moet worden ingediend, omvat ten minste de in Aanhangsel II omschreven informatie.   
2.  De Partij van herkomst zendt de mogelijk benadeelde Partij, eventueel door tussenkomst van een gezamenlijk lichaam, het milieueffectrapport toe. De betrokken Partijen dragen zorg voor de toezending van het milieu-effectrapport aan de autoriteiten en het publiek van de mogelijk benadeelde Partij in de gebieden die het grensoverschrijdende effect mogelijk raakt, en bieden een redelijke termijn voor het indienen van commentaar bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Partij van herkomst, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door tussenkomst van de Partij van herkomst, voordat het definitieve besluit over de voorgenomen activiteit wordt genomen.   

### Artikel  5  

####Overleg op basis van het milieu-effectrapport

Na de voltooiing van het milieu-effectrapport treedt de Partij van herkomst, zonder onnodige vertraging, met de mogelijk benadeelde Partij in overleg over onder meer het mogelijke grensoverschrijdende effect van de voorgenomen activiteit en over maatregelen om dit effect te beperken of uit te sluiten. In dit overleg kunnen de volgende zaken aan de orde komen: 

a. mogelijke alternatieven voor de voorgenomen activiteit, met inbegrip van de keuze geen activiteit te doen plaatsvinden (het nulalternatief), en mogelijke maatregelen om het belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende effect te verminderen en, op kosten van de Partij van herkomst, het effect van die maatregelen te controleren;  

b. andere vormen van mogelijke onderlinge bijstand bij het beperken van belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende effecten van de voorgenomen activiteit; en  

c. alle andere met de voorgenomen activiteit verband houdende zaken.   De Partijen komen bij aanvang van het overleg een redelijk tijdsbestek voor de duur ervan overeen. Het overleg kan eventueel worden gevoerd door tussenkomst van een gezamenlijk lichaam.  

### Artikel  6  

####Het definitieve besluit

1.  De Partijen dragen er zorg voor dat bij het nemen van het definitieve besluit over de voorgenomen activiteit gepast rekening wordt gehouden met het resultaat van de milieu-effectrapportage, met inbegrip van het milieu-effectrapport, alsook met het commentaar daarop dat is ontvangen ingevolge artikel 3, achtste lid, en artikel 4, tweede lid, en met het resultaat van het in artikel 5 bedoelde overleg.   
2.  De Partij van herkomst deelt de mogelijk benadeelde Partij het definitieve besluit over de voorgenomen activiteit mede, alsmede de redenen en overwegingen waarop het is gebaseerd.   
3.  Indien een betrokken Partij, voordat de uitvoering van een voorgenomen activiteit wordt aangevangen, de beschikking krijgt over bijkomende informatie over het belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende effect van die activiteit, welke informatie niet beschikbaar was op het tijdstip waarop het besluit over die activiteit werd genomen, en die het besluit inhoudelijk zou kunnen hebben beïnvloed, deelt die Partij dit onmiddellijk mede aan de andere betrokken Partij of Partijen. Indien een van de betrokken Partijen hierom verzoekt, wordt overleg gepleegd over de vraag of het besluit moet worden herzien.   

### Artikel  7  

####Evaluatie

1.  De betrokken Partijen besluiten, indien een van hen daarom verzoekt, of, en zo ja, in welke mate, een evaluatie wordt verricht, rekening houdend met het oog op het mogelijke belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende effect van de activiteit ten aanzien waarvan milieu-effectrapportage heeft plaatsgevonden ingevolge dit Verdrag. Evaluatie behelst met name toezicht op de activiteit en vaststelling van eventuele nadelige grensoverschrijdende effecten. Dit toezicht en deze vaststelling kunnen plaatsvinden met het oog op de verwezenlijking van de in Aanhangsel V genoemde doeleinden.   
2.  Wanneer de Partij van herkomst of de mogelijk benadeelde Partij ten gevolge van een evaluatie op redelijke gronden tot de slotsom komt dat er sprake is van een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend effect of dat factoren aan het licht zijn gekomen die tot een dergelijk effect kunnen leiden, deelt zij dit onmiddellijk mee aan de andere Partij. De betrokken Partijen plegen vervolgens overleg over de nodige maatregelen om dat effect te beperken of uit te sluiten.   

### Artikel  8  

####Bilaterale en multilaterale samenwerking

De Partijen kunnen bestaande bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of andere regelingen voortzetten, of nieuwe zodanige overeenkomsten of regelingen aangaan, ter nakoming van hun verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag. De lijst van punten in Aanhangsel VI zou als basis kunnen dienen voor deze overeenkomsten of regelingen.  

### Artikel  9  

####Onderzoeksprogramma's

De Partijen schenken bijzondere aandacht aan het opzetten of intensiveren van specifieke onderzoeksprogramma's gericht op: 

a. het verbeteren van bestaande kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve methoden voor het beoordelen van de effecten van voorgenomen activiteiten;  

b. het verkrijgen van beter inzicht in de samenhang tussen oorzaak en gevolg en in de rol daarvan in geïntegreerd milieubeleid;  

c. het analyseren en controleren van de doelmatige uitvoering van beslissingen over voorgenomen activiteiten ten einde effecten tot het minimum te beperken of te voorkomen;  

d. het ontwikkelen van methoden om creatieve benaderingen te stimuleren bij het zoeken naar milieuvriendelijke alternatieven voor voorgenomen activiteiten en voor bestaande produktie- en consumptiepatronen;  

e. het ontwikkelen van methoden voor de toepassing van de beginselen van milieu-effectrapportage op macro-economisch niveau.   De Partijen wisselen de resultaten van de hierboven bedoelde onderzoeksprogramma's uit.

####Algemene criteria als hulpmiddel bij het vaststellen van het milieu-effect van activiteiten die niet worden genoemd in Aanhangsel I

### 1  

Indien er sprake is van een voorgenomen activiteit waarop artikel 2, vijfde lid, van toepassing is, kunnen de betrokken Partijen bezien of die activiteit mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend milieu-effect heeft, met name aan de hand van een of meer van de volgende criteria: 

a *omvang:* voorgenomen activiteiten die voor dat soort activiteit een grote omvang zouden hebben;  

b *plaats:* voorgenomen activiteiten die zouden plaatsvinden in of nabij een gebied waar het milieu bijzonder kwetsbaar is, of dat van bijzonder belang is (bijvoorbeeld watergebieden die als bijzonder gelden krachtens de Overeenkomst van Ramsar, nationale parken, natuurreservaten, gebieden van bijzonder wetenschappelijk belang, of van archeologische, culturele of historische betekenis); alsmede voorgenomen activiteiten op plaatsen waar de kenmerken van een voorgenomen ontwikkeling belangrijke nadelige gevolgen voor de bevolking zou hebben;  

c. *gevolgen:* voorgenomen activiteiten met bijzonder ingewikkelde en mogelijk nadelige gevolgen, waaronder activiteiten die ernstige gevolgen zouden hebben voor mensen of voor waardevolle plante- en diersoorten of organismen, activiteiten waardoor het bestaan of het mogelijke nut van een gebied wordt bedreigd, en activiteiten die een extra belasting veroorzaken waartegen het milieu niet bestand is.    

### 2  

De betrokken Partijen bezien in dit verband voorgenomen activiteiten die nabij een internationale grens zijn gepland, alsmede voorgenomen activiteiten die op grotere afstand zouden plaatsvinden, die belangrijke nadelige grensoverschrijdende milieu-effecten zouden kunnen veroorzaken op grote afstand van de plaats waar zij zijn gepland.  

### Aanhangsel  IV  

####De onderzoeksprocedure

### 1  

De verzoekende Partij(en) stelt(stellen) het secretariaat ervan in kennis dat zij de vraag of een in Aanhangsel I genoemde voorgenomen activiteit mogelijk een belangrijk nadelig grensoverschrijdend milieueffect heeft, voorlegt(voorleggen) aan een in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Aanhangsel ingestelde onderzoekscommissie. In deze kennisgeving wordt het onderwerp van het onderzoek vermeld. Het secretariaat stelt alle Partijen bij het Verdrag onverwijld in kennis van het feit dat de vraag aan een onderzoekscommissie is voorgelegd.  

### 2  

De onderzoekscommissie bestaat uit drie leden. De verzoekende partij en de andere partij bij de onderzoeksprocedure benoemen elk een wetenschappelijk of technisch deskundige, en de twee aldus benoemde deskundigen wijzen met gezamenlijke instemming de derde deskundige aan, die voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie wordt. Deze derde deskundige mag geen onderdaan van een van de partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure zijn, noch mag hij of zij zijn of haar gewone verblijfplaats op het grondgebied van een van die partijen hebben, of in dienst zijn bij een van hen, of in een andere hoedanigheid reeds bij de aangelegenheid betrokken zijn geweest.  

### 3  

Indien de voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie niet is aangewezen binnen twee maanden na de benoeming van de tweede deskundige, wijst de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, op verzoek van een van beide partijen, binnen een volgend tijdvak van twee maanden de voorzitter aan.  

### 4  

Indien een van de partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure niet binnen een maand nadat zij de kennisgeving van het secretariaat heeft ontvangen, een deskundige heeft benoemd, kan de andere partij dit mededelen aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die binnen een volgend tijdvak van twee maanden de voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie aanwijst. Vervolgens verzoekt de voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie de partij die nog geen deskundige heeft benoemd, dit binnen een maand te doen. Indien die partij dit na het verstrijken van dat tijdvak niet heeft gedaan, deelt de voorzitter dit mede aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die vervolgens binnen twee maanden de benoeming verricht.  

### 5  

De onderzoekscommissie stelt haar eigen procedureregels vast.  

### 6  

De onderzoekscommissie kan alle passende maatregelen nemen voor de uitvoering van haar taken.  

### 7  

De partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure doen alles wat in hun vermogen ligt om het werk van de onderzoekscommissie te vergemakkelijken, met name door: 

a. haar alle relevante documenten, voorzieningen en informatie te verstrekken;  

b. haar indien nodig in staat te stellen getuigen of deskundigen op te roepen en verklaringen van hen te verkrijgen.    

### 8  

De partijen en de deskundigen beschermen de vertrouwelijkheid van de informatie die zij gedurende het werk van de onderzoekscommissie in vertrouwen verkrijgen.  

### 9  

Indien een van de partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure niet voor de onderzoekscommissie verschijnt of haar zaak niet toelicht, kan de andere partij de onderzoekscommissie verzoeken de procedure voort te zetten en haar werk te voltooien. Het feit dat een partij niet voor de commissie verschijnt of haar zaak niet toelicht, vormt geen belemmering voor de voortzetting en voltooiing van het werk van de onderzoekscommissie.  

### 10  

Tenzij de onderzoekscommissie anders bepaalt vanwege de bijzondere omstandigheden van de aangelegenheid, worden de kosten van de commissie, met inbegrip van de honorering van haar leden, in gelijke delen gedragen door de partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure. De onderzoekscommissie houdt een overzicht van al haar kosten bij, en verstrekt de partijen daarvan een eindopgave.  

### 11  

Iedere Partij die een belang ten aanzien van de feiten heeft bij de aangelegenheid die het onderwerp van de onderzoeksprocedure vormt, en waarvoor het advies van de commissie gevolgen kan hebben, kan zich met de instemming van de onderzoekscommissie voegen in de procedure.  

### 12  

De besluiten van de onderzoekscommissie over procedure-aangelegenheden worden genomen met een meerderheid van de stemmen van haar leden. In het uiteindelijke advies van de onderzoekscommissie dient de opvatting van de meerderheid van haar leden te worden weerspiegeld, en dient iedere daarvan afwijkende opvatting te worden opgenomen.  

### 13  

De onderzoekscommissie biedt haar uiteindelijke advies aan binnen twee maanden na de datum waarop zij werd ingesteld, tenzij zij het noodzakelijk acht deze termijn te verlengen met een tijdvak van ten hoogste twee maanden.  

### 14  

Het uiteindelijke advies van de onderzoekscommissie dient gebaseerd te zijn op algemeen aanvaarde wetenschappelijke beginselen. Het uiteindelijke advies wordt door de onderzoekscommissie toegezonden aan de partijen bij de onderzoeksprocedure, alsmede aan het secretariaat.  

### Aanhangsel  V

Het secretariaat zendt de ontvangen informatie toe aan alle Partijen bij dit Verdrag.  

### 2  

Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden. De eisende Partij(en) en de andere Partij(en) bij het geschil benoemen een arbiter, en de twee aldus benoemde arbiters wijzen met gezamenlijke instemming de derde arbiter aan, die voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht wordt. De derde arbiter mag geen onderdaan van een van de partijen bij het geschil zijn, noch mag hij of zij zijn of haar gewone verblijfplaats op het grondgebied van een van die Partijen hebben, of in dienst zijn bij een van hen, of in een andere hoedanigheid reeds bij de aangelegenheid betrokken zijn geweest.  

### 3  

Indien de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht niet is aangewezen binnen twee maanden na de benoeming van de tweede arbiter, wijst de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, op verzoek van een van beide partijen bij het geschil, binnen een volgend tijdvak van twee maanden de voorzitter aan.  

### 4  

Indien een van de partijen bij het geschil niet binnen twee maanden nadat zij het verzoek daartoe heeft ontvangen, een arbiter heeft benoemd, kan de andere partij dit mededelen aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die binnen een volgend tijdvak van twee maanden de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht aanwijst. Vervolgens verzoekt de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht de partij die nog geen arbiter heeft benoemd, dit binnen twee maanden te doen. Indien die partij dit na het verstrijken van dat tijdvak niet heeft gedaan, deelt de voorzitter dit mede aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die vervolgens binnen twee maanden de benoeming verricht.
