ii. indien hij of zij gedurende de laatste 10 kalenderjaren onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan zijn of haar pensionering of invaliditeit, woonde in Nederland of in een derde staat waarmee beide Verdragsluitende Partijen een verdrag inzake sociale zekerheid hebben gesloten, of woonde in Malta, maar met vrijtelling van de betaling van bijdragen krachtens de wetgeving van Malta, is verdiend of ontvangen in Malta gedurende de laatste 10 kalenderjaren onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan zijn of haar laatste werkdag in loondienst of als zelfstandige in Malta.       
2.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid, wordt, bij het vaststellen van het recht op een uitkering ingevolge de wetgeving van Malta anders dan een pensioen in verband met invaliditeit, een kalenderjaar dat een verzekeringstijdvak is krachtens de Nederlandse verzekering na 7 mei 1956, beschouwd als 52 weken aan bijdragen krachtens de wetgeving van Malta.   
3.  Ingevolge dit artikel vindt geen optelling van verzekeringstijdvakken plaats tenzij: 

a. in het geval van een tweederde pensioen (pensionering) dat verschuldigd is ingevolge de wetgeving van Malta, de betrokkene na 22 januari 1979 ten minste 156 bijdragen heeft betaald;  

b. in het geval van een nabestaandenpensioen (weduwschap) dat verschuldigd is ingevolge de wetgeving van Malta, de overleden echtgenoot van de betrokken rechthebbende na 22 januari 1979 ten minste 156 bijdragen zou hebben betaald;  

c. in het geval van een ander pensioen ter zake van pensionering of weduwschap dat verschuldigd is ingevolge de wetgeving van Malta, de betrokkene of de echtgenoot (zoals het geval is met een pensioen in verband met weduwschap) ten minste 52 bijdragen heeft betaald.     

### Artikel  17  

####Berekening van Maltese uitkeringen

Het bevoegde orgaan van Malta berekent eerst het bedrag van de theoretische uitkering die verschuldigd zou zijn indien de verzekeringstijdvakken ingevolge de wetgeving van Nederland en Malta, samengeteld zoals voorzien in artikel 15 of 16, zoals vereist, rekening houdend met tijdvakken in een derde staat waarmee beide Verdragsluitende Partijen een verdrag inzake sociale zekerheid hebben gesloten, alleen zouden zijn betaald of ingehouden ingevolge de wetgeving van Malta. De aldus berekende theoretische uitkering wordt bepaald naar evenredigheid van de verhouding tussen het totaal van de voor berekening in aanmerking komende bijdragen die uit hoofde van de wetgeving van Malta zijn betaald of ingehouden en het aantal bijdragen na optelling zoals vereist krachtens artikel 15 of 16.  

####BEPALINGEN INZAKE DE UITVOERING VAN DE NEDERLANDSE WETGEVING

### Artikel  18  

####Bepalingen betreffende de Nederlandse arbeidsongeschiktheidsuitkeringen

Wanneer een persoon op wie dit Verdrag van toepassing is, op het tijdstip waarop de ongeschiktheid om te werken wordt gevolgd door arbeidsongeschiktheid, valt onder de Maltese socialeverzekeringswet en hij recht had op een Maltees invaliditeitspensioen, en wanneer de betrokkene daarvóór een verzekeringstijdvak van ten minste twaalf maanden had voltooid krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving inzake de verzekering tegen arbeidsongeschiktheid, heeft deze persoon recht op een uitkering uit hoofde van de laatstbedoelde wetgeving, berekend volgens de regels van artikel 19.  

### Artikel  19  

####Berekening van Nederlandse arbeidsongeschiktheidsuitkeringen

1.  Het bedrag van de in artikel 18 bedoelde uitkering wordt berekend naar verhouding van de totale duur van de door de betrokkene na het bereiken van de leeftijd van 15 jaar krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving afgeronde verzekeringstijdvakken tot het tijdvak gelegen tussen de datum waarop hij de leeftijd van 15 jaar bereikte en de datum waarop zijn arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ontstaan.   
2.  Indien de betrokkene, op het tijdstip waarop de arbeidsongeschiktheid met daarop volgende invaliditeit is ontstaan, als werknemer werkzaam was of met een werknemer was gelijkgesteld, wordt de verschuldigde uitkering vastgesteld overeenkomstig de Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering van 18 februari 1966 (WAO). Indien dit niet het geval is, wordt de verschuldigde uitkering vastgesteld overeenkomstig de Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering Zelfstandigen van 24 april 1997 (WAZ).   
3.  Afgeronde verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving zijn: 

a. verzekeringstijdvakken afgerond krachtens de Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (WAO) van 18 februari 1966;  

b. verzekeringstijdvakken afgerond krachtens de Algemene Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekeringswet van 11 december 1975 (AAW), voor zover deze niet samenvallen met verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de voornoemde Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheid van 18 februari 1966 (WAO);  

c. verzekeringstijdvakken afgerond krachtens de Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekeringswet Zelfstandigen van 24 april 1997 (WAZ), voor zover deze niet samenvallen met verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de voornoemde Wet Arbeidsongeschiktheid van 18 februari 1966 (WAO);  

d. tijdvakken van arbeid en daarmee gelijkgestelde tijdvakken die vóór 1 juli 1967 in Nederland zijn afgerond.     

### Artikel  20  

####Bepalingen inzake het Nederlandse ouderdomspensioen

1.  In geval van ouderdom stelt het Nederlandse bevoegde orgaan het pensioen rechtstreeks en uitsluitend vast op basis van de krachtens de Nederlandse algemene ouderdomswet (AOW) afgeronde verzekeringstijdvakken.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in het derde lid worden tijdvakken vóór 1 januari 1957 gedurende welke een onderdaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij of een persoon beschreven in artikel 4, onderdeel b, na het bereiken van de 15-jarige leeftijd in Nederland heeft gewoond of gedurende welke hij, in een ander land wonende, in Nederland arbeid in loondienst heeft verricht, mede aangemerkt als verzekeringstijdvakken indien hij niet voldoet aan de voorwaarden van de Nederlandse wetgeving op grond waarvan zulke tijdvakken voor hem met verzekeringstijdvakken mogen worden gelijkgesteld.   
3.  De in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde tijdvakken worden bij de berekening van het ouderdomspensioen alleen in aanmerking genomen, indien de betrokkene verzekerd is geweest in de zin van artikel 6 van de Nederlandse Algemene Ouderdomswet en na het bereiken van de leeftijd van negenenvijftig jaar ten minste zes jaar op het grondgebied van een van beide of beide Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft gewoond en alleen zolang hij op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij woont.

### Artikel  22  

####Berekening van het Nederlandse nabestaandenpensioen

Het bedrag van de in artikel 21 bedoelde uitkering wordt berekend naar evenredigheid van de verhouding tussen de totale duur van de door de overledene voor het bereiken van de 65-jarige leeftijd krachtens de Nederlandse wetgeving vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken en het tijdvak gelegen tussen de datum waarop hij de 15-jarige leeftijd bereikte en de datum van zijn overlijden, maar uiterlijk de datum waarop de overledene de 65-jarige leeftijd bereikte.

3.  Indien aan de voorwaarden voor het recht op kinderbijslagen is voldaan krachtens de wetgeving van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt het recht op kinderbijslagen alleen toegekend krachtens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan het kind woont.

1.  Na ontvangst van een aanvraag verifieert het bevoegde orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij de inlichtingen met betrekking tot de aanvrager, en indien van toepassing, van elk lid van hetzelfde gezin en zendt dit bewijsmateriaal tezamen met andere relevante documenten aan het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, opdat deze de aanvraag verder kan behandelen.   
2.  Het eerste lid is ook van toepassing wanneer het bevoegde orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij de andere Verdragsluitende Partij verzoekt een onderzoek in te stellen ter verificatie van de rechtmatigheid van betalingen gedaan aan rechthebbenden die wonen of verblijven op het grondgebied van die andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
3.  De in het eerste en tweede lid bedoelde inlichtingen omvatten tevens, voor zover mogelijk, inlichtingen met betrekking tot adres, werk, het volgen van scholing, inkomen, gezinssituatie, arbeidsgeschiktheid of gezondheidstoestand.   
4.  De bevoegde organen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar en met hun onderscheiden rechthebbenden of hun vertegenwoordigers in verbinding stellen.   
5.  De diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordigers en de bevoegde organen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen zich rechtstreeks in verbinding stellen met de autoriteiten op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij teneinde het recht op uitkering van en de rechtmatigheid van betalingen aan hun respectieve rechthebbenden vast te stellen.   
6.  Het begrip autoriteiten bedoeld in het vorige lid wordt geacht te omvatten de autoriteiten verantwoordelijk voor belastingen, bevolkingsregisters, huwelijksregisters, arbeidsbureaus en scholen.   
7.  Zonder voorafgaand verzoek stellen de bevoegde organen elkaar, voor zover mogelijk, op de hoogte van omstandigheden die van belang kunnen zijn bij het beslissen over een uitkering en van omstandigheden die van invloed kunnen zijn op de hoogte van een uitkering en sluiten documentatie van de relevante inlichtingen bij.   

### Artikel  28  

####Identificatie

Teneinde het recht op een uitkering en de rechtmatigheid van betalingen ingevolge de Maltese of Nederlandse wetgeving vast te stellen, is een persoon die valt onder de reikwijdte van het Verdrag verplicht zich te identificeren door overlegging van een officieel identiteitsbewijs aan het bevoegde orgaan in Malta of Nederland.  

### Artikel  29

2.  De betrokkene is verplicht gehoor te geven aan een verzoek als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel door zich te melden voor medisch onderzoek. Indien de persoon zich om medische redenen niet in staat acht te reizen naar het grondgebied van de Staat waar hij is opgeroepen door het bevoegde orgaan, stelt hij dat orgaan daarvan onverwijld in kennis. De betrokkene is alsdan verplicht een medische verklaring te overleggen die is afgegeven door een daartoe door het bevoegde orgaan aangewezen arts. Deze verklaring moet de medische redenen bevatten van de onmogelijkheid te reizen, alsmede de verwachte duur van deze onmogelijkheid.

####Terugvordering van onverschuldigde betalingen

1.  Indien bij de beoordeling of herziening van een uitkering ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 2 van het Verdrag het bevoegde orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij aan een rechthebbende een bedrag heeft betaald dat hoger is dan waar hij recht op heeft, kan het het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat verantwoordelijk is voor de betaling van een overeenkomstige uitkering aan die persoon, verzoeken om het teveel betaalde bedrag in mindering te brengen op achterstallige bedragen die aan hem verschuldigd zijn. Het laatstgenoemde orgaan maakt het aldus in mindering gebrachte bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft. Indien de terugvordering niet op deze wijze kan plaatsvinden, zijn de bepalingen van het volgende lid van toepassing.   
2.  Wanneer het bevoegde orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij een bedrag heeft betaald aan een rechthebbende dat hoger is dan waar hij recht op heeft, kan dat orgaan, onder de voorwaarden en voorzover toegestaan volgens de wetgeving die het uitvoert, het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat verantwoordelijk is voor de betaling van een uitkering aan die persoon verzoeken om het te veel betaalde bedrag in mindering te brengen op de betalingen die het aan hem doet. Het laatstbedoelde orgaan brengt dat bedrag in mindering voorzover zulks is toegelaten volgens de wetgeving die het uitvoert, alsof het zelf te veel had betaald, en maakt het aldus in mindering gebrachte bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft.   
3.  Wanneer het bevoegde orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij een voorschot heeft betaald op een uitkering voor een tijdvak gedurende welk de rechthebbende recht had op een overeenkomstige uitkering ingevolge de wetgeving van die Verdragsluitende Partij, kan het het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij verzoeken het bedrag van de voorschotten in mindering te brengen op betalingen die het aan hem verschuldigd is over hetzelfde tijdvak.
