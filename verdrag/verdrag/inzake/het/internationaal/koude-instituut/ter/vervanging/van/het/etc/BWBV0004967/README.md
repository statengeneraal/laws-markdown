##Verdrag inzake het Internationaal Koude-Instituut, ter vervanging van het Verdrag van 21 juni 1920, gewijzigd op 31 mei 1937

####Agreement concerning the International Institute of Refrigeration (Replacing the Convention of 21st June 1920 as modified on 31st May 1937).

The Governments of the Member Countries of the International Institute of Refrigeration; Whereas the science of low temperatures is constantly developing thus opening new prospects of progress and human welfare; Whereas the uses of refrigeration are being extended to new fields; Whereas the exchange of perishable foodstuffs among the nations of the world is increasing thus permitting more effective international solidarity on matters of nutrition but making necessary the extended use of refrigeration for the treatment and preservation of these foodstuffs; Considering that the Convention of 21st June 1920, as modified on 31st May 1937, creating the International Institute of Refrigeration does not completely correspond to the new scientific and technical demands arising from this situation nor to present-day economic conditions;   Have agreed as follows:
