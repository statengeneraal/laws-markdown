####Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women

The States Parties to the present Convention, Noting that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women, Noting that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination and proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, including distinction based on sex, Noting that the States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure the equal right of men and women to enjoy all economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, Considering the international conventions concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women, Noting also the resolutions, declarations and recommendations adopted by the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women, Concerned, however, that despite these various instruments extensive discrimination against women continues to exist, Recalling that discrimination against women violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity, is an obstacle to the participation of women, on equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries, hampers the growth of the prosperity of society and the family and makes more difficult the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of humanity, Concerned that in situations of poverty women have the least access to food, health, education, training and opportunities for employment and other needs, Convinced that the establishment of the new international economic order based on equity and justice will contribute significantly towards the promotion of equality between men and women, Emphasizing that the eradication of *apartheid,* of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, colonialism, neo-colonialism, aggression, foreign occupation and domination and interference in the internal affairs of States is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women, Affirming that the strengthening of international peace and security, relaxation of international tension, mutual co-operation among all States irrespective of their social and economic systems, general and complete disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control, the affirmation of the principles of justice, equality and mutual benefit in relations among countries and the realization of the right of peoples under alien and colonial domination and foreign occupation to self-determination and independence, as well as respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, will promote social progress and development and as a consequence will contribute to the attainment of full equality between men and women, Convinced that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields, Bearing in mind the great contribution of women to the welfare of the family and to the development of society, so far not fully recognized, the social significance of maternity and the role of both parents in the family and in the upbringing of children, and aware that the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination but that the upbringing of children requires a sharing of responsibility between men and women and society as a whole, Aware that a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve full equality between men and women, Determined to implement the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and, for that purpose, to adopt the measures required for the elimination of such discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, Have agreed on the following:

####Verdrag inzake de uitbanning van alle vormen van discriminatie van vrouwen

De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, Erop wijzend dat het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties opnieuw het vertrouwen in de fundamentele rechten van de mens, in de waardigheid en de waarde van de mens en in de gelijke rechten van mannen en vrouwen bevestigt, Erop wijzend dat de Universele Verklaring van de rechten van de mens het beginsel van de ontoelaatbaarheid van discriminatie bevestigt en verkondigt dat alle mensen vrij en gelijk in waardigheid en in rechten zijn geboren en dat een ieder aanspraak heeft op alle daarin genoemde rechten en vrijheden, zonder enig onderscheid van welke aard ook, waaronder begrepen ieder onderscheid naar geslacht, Erop wijzend dat de Staten die partij zijn bij de Internationale Verdragen inzake de rechten van de mens verplicht zijn het gelijke recht van mannen en vrouwen op het genot van alle economische, sociale, culturele, burgerlijke en politieke rechten te verzekeren, In aanmerking nemend de internationale overeenkomsten gesloten onder auspiciën van de Verenigde Naties en de gespecialiseerde organisaties ter bevordering van de gelijkgerechtigdheid van mannen en vrouwen, Tevens wijzend op de resoluties, verklaringen en aanbevelingen aangenomen door de Verenigde Naties en de gespecialiseerde organisaties ter bevordering van de gelijkgerechtigdheid van mannen en vrouwen, Evenwel verontrust over het feit dat ondanks deze verschillende akten wijdverbreide discriminatie van vrouwen nog steeds bestaat, Eraan herinnerend dat discriminatie van vrouwen schending van de beginselen van gelijkgerechtigdheid en eerbied voor de menselijke waardigheid is, de deelneming van vrouwen op gelijke voet met mannen aan het politieke, sociale, economische en culturele leven van hun land in de weg staat, de toename van de welvaart van de maatschappij en het gezin belemmert en de volledige ontplooiing van de mogelijkheden van vrouwen bij het dienen van hun land en van de mensheid ernstig bemoeilijkt, Verontrust over het feit dat vrouwen in situaties van armoede worden achtergesteld bij de verkrijging van voedsel, gezondheidszorg, onderwijs, opleiding en werkgelegenheid, alsmede van andere mogelijkheden om in hun behoeften te voorzien, Ervan overtuigd dat de invoering van de nieuwe internationale economische orde, gebaseerd op billijkheid en rechtvaardigheid, een aanzienlijke bijdrage zal leveren aan de bevordering van de gelijkheid van mannen en vrouwen, Met nadruk erop wijzend dat de uitbanning van apartheid, van alle vormen van racisme, van rassendiscriminatie, van kolonialisme, van neo-kolonialisme, van agressie, van buitenlandse bezetting en overheersing en van inmenging in de binnenlandse aangelegenheden van Staten, van essentieel belang is voor het volledige genot van rechten door mannen en vrouwen, Bevestigend dat de versterking van de internationale vrede en veiligheid, de internationale ontspanning, de onderlinge samenwerking tussen alle Staten ongeacht hun sociaal en economisch stelsel, de algemene en volledige ontwapening, in het bijzonder nucleaire ontwapening onder streng en doeltreffend internationaal toezicht, de bevestiging van de beginselen van rechtvaardigheid, gelijkheid en wederzijds belang in de betrekkingen tussen de landen, en de verwezenlijking van het recht van volken, levend onder vreemde en koloniale overheersing en buitenlandse bezetting, op zelfbeschikking en onafhankelijkheid, alsmede de eerbiediging van de nationale soevereiniteit en de territoriale integriteit, de maatschappelijke vooruitgang en ontwikkeling zullen bevorderen en derhalve zullen bijdragen tot het bereiken van volledige gelijkheid van mannen en vrouwen, Ervan overtuigd dat voor de volledige ontwikkeling van een land, het welzijn van de wereld en de zaak van de vrede is vereist dat zoveel mogelijk vrouwen, op gelijke voet met mannen, op alle gebieden deelnemen, Indachtig de belangrijke, tot dusverre niet volledig erkende bijdrage van vrouwen aan het welzijn van het gezin en aan de ontwikkeling van de maatschappij, alsmede de maatschappelijke betekenis van het moederschap en de rol van beide ouders in het gezin en bij de opvoeding van kinderen, en beseffend dat de functie van vrouwen bij de voortplanting geen basis voor discriminatie mag zijn, maar dat de verantwoordelijkheid voor de opvoeding van kinderen door mannen, vrouwen en samenleving als geheel gezamenlijk moet worden gedragen. Zich ervan bewust dat een verandering in de traditionele rol zowel van mannen als van vrouwen in de maatschappij en in het gezin noodzakelijk is om tot volledige gelijkheid van mannen en vrouwen te komen. Vastbesloten de beginselen, genoemd in de Verklaring inzake de uitbanning van discriminatie van vrouwen, te verwezenlijken en te dien einde de maatregelen die ten behoeve van de uitbanning van zodanige discriminatie in al haar vormen en uitingen zijn vereist, aan te nemen, Zij overeengekomen als volgt:
