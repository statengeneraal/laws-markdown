3.  Een ieder tegen wie de in het tweede lid genoemde maatregelen worden genomen, heeft het recht: 

a. zich onverwijld in verbinding te stellen met de dichtstbijzijnde daarvoor in aanmerking komende vertegenwoordiger van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is of die anderszins gerechtigd is om de rechten van deze persoon te beschermen, of , indien het een staatloze betreft, de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan hij zijn vaste verblijfplaats heeft;  

b. te worden bezocht door een vertegenwoordiger van die Staat;  

c. te worden geïnformeerd over zijn rechten op grond van de onderdelen a en b.     
4.  De in het derde lid bedoelde rechten worden uitgeoefend in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de dader of de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, met dien verstande dat de genoemde wetten en voorschriften het mogelijk maken dat de doeleinden die met de krachtens het derde lid verleende rechten worden beoogd, volledig kunnen worden verwezenlijkt.   
5.  De bepalingen van het derde en vierde lid gelden onverminderd het recht van een Staat die Partij is en die zich beroept op rechtsmacht overeenkomstig artikel 6, eerste lid, onderdeel c, of tweede lid, onderdeel c, het Internationale Rode Kruis te verzoeken zich in verbinding te stellen met de vermoedelijke dader en deze te bezoeken.   
6.  Wanneer een Staat die Partij is krachtens dit artikel een persoon in detentie heeft gesteld, stelt hij de Staten die Partij zijn en die overeenkomstig artikel 6, eerste en tweede lid, hun rechtsmacht hebben gevestigd, alsmede wanneer hij dit nodig acht, alle andere belanghebbende Staten die Partij zijn, rechtstreeks of via de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, onverwijld in kennis van het feit dat de betrokken persoon in detentie is gesteld en van de omstandigheden die zijn detentie rechtvaardigen. De Staat die het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde onderzoek instelt, deelt zijn bevindingen onverwijld mee aan genoemde Staten die Partij zijn en geeft tevens aan of hij voornemens is zijn rechtsmacht uit te oefenen.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  De Staat die Partij is en op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, is, in de gevallen waarop artikel 6 van toepassing is, indien hij deze persoon niet uitlevert, zonder enige uitzondering en ongeacht of het strafbare feit op zijn grondgebied is gepleegd of niet, verplicht de zaak zonder onnodige vertraging over te dragen aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten voor vervolging door middel van een procedure overeenkomstig het recht van die Staat. Deze autoriteiten nemen hun beslissing op dezelfde wijze als in geval van elk ander strafbaar feit van ernstige aard krachtens het recht van die Staat.   
2.  Wanneer het een Staat die Partij is op grond van zijn nationale wetgeving alleen is toegestaan een onderdaan uit te leveren of op andere wijze over te leveren op voorwaarde dat deze wordt teruggezonden naar die Staat om de straf te ondergaan die is opgelegd als gevolg van het proces of de procedure waarvoor de uitlevering of overgave van de persoon werd verzocht, en deze Staat en de Staat die verzoekt om uitlevering van de persoon instemmen met deze optie en andere voorwaarden die zij gepast achten, is een dergelijke voorwaardelijke uitlevering of overgave voldoende voor ontheffing van de in het eerste lid omschreven verplichting.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Voordat dit Verdrag in werking treedt, worden de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten in alle tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bestaande uitleveringsverdragen geacht te zijn begrepen als uitleveringsdelicten. De Staten die Partij zijn verplichten zich ertoe bedoelde strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat vervolgens tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.  Indien een Staat die Partij is en die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die Partij is waarmee hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan de aangezochte Staat die Partij is, indien hij dit verkiest, dit Verdrag beschouwen als een juridische grondslag voor uitlevering op grond van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten. De uitlevering is onderworpen aan de overige voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
3.  Staten die Partij zijn en die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten onderling als uitleveringsdelicten, onderworpen aan de voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
4.  Voor uitlevering tussen Staten die Partij zijn worden de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, indien nodig, beschouwd als niet alleen begaan op de plaats waar zij zijn gepleegd, maar ook op het grondgebied van de Staten die hun rechtsmacht hebben gevestigd overeenkomstig artikel 6, eerste en tweede lid.   
5.  De bepalingen van alle uitleveringsverdragen en -regelingen die tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bestaan met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten omschreven in artikel 2, worden geacht in hun onderlinge betrekkingen te zijn gewijzigd, voor zover zij niet verenigbaar zijn met dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  De Staten die Partij zijn verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke rechtshulp bij onderzoeken, bij strafzaken of bij uitleveringsprocedures op grond van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van rechtshulp ter verkrijging van bewijs in hun bezit dat nodig is voor het proces.   
2.  De Staten die Partij zijn komen hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van het eerste lid na in overeenstemming met de verdragen en regelingen inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp die tussen hen bestaan. Indien dergelijke verdragen of regelingen ontbreken, verlenen de Staten die Partij zijn elkaar rechtshulp overeenkomstig hun nationale recht.   

### Artikel  11  

Geen van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten zal, ten behoeve van uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp, worden beschouwd als een politiek delict, een met een politiek delict samenhangend delict of een delict ingegeven door politieke motieven. Dienovereenkomstig mag een verzoek om uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp op basis van een dergelijk delict niet worden geweigerd met als enige reden dat het een politiek delict, een met een politiek delict samenhangend delict of een delict ingegeven door politieke motieven betreft.  

### Artikel  12  

Niets in dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat het verplicht tot uitlevering of tot het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp in gevallen waarin de aangezochte Staat die Partij is ernstige redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat het verzoek tot uitlevering voor in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten of tot wederzijdse rechtshulp met betrekking tot dergelijke feiten is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te bestraffen op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, etnische afkomst of politieke overtuiging, of dat inwilliging van het verzoek de positie van betrokkene om een van deze redenen ongunstig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  Een persoon die in detentie zit of een straf ondergaat op het grondgebied van een Staat die Partij is, en om wiens aanwezigheid op het grondgebied van een andere Staat die Partij is wordt verzocht voor het afleggen van een getuigenverklaring, identificatie of voor het op andere wijze verlenen van medewerking ter verkrijging van bewijs voor onderzoek of vervolging inzake strafbare feiten krachtens dit Verdrag, mag worden overgebracht, indien wordt voldaan aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. de persoon geeft vrijwillig zijn of haar op volledige informatie gebaseerde toestemming; en  

b. de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten stemmen ermee in overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die die Staten gepast achten.     
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel: 

a. is de Staat waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht bevoegd en verplicht de overgebrachte persoon in detentie te houden, tenzij anderszins verzocht of gemachtigd door de Staat vanuit welke de persoon is overgebracht;  

b. komt de Staat waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht onverwijld zijn verplichting na tot terugzending van de persoon voor detentie door de Staat vanuit welke deze persoon is overgebracht, zoals vooraf overeengekomen, of op andere wijze overeengekomen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten;  

c. verlangt de Staat waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht niet van de Staat vanwaar de persoon is overgebracht dat deze een uitleveringsprocedure begint ten behoeve van de terugkeer van de persoon;  

d. krijgt de overgebrachte persoon vermindering van de straf die hij in de Staat vanwaar hij is overgebracht moet uitzitten met de tijd die hij in detentie heeft doorgebracht in de Staat waarnaar hij is overgebracht.     
3.  Tenzij de Staat die Partij is vanwaar een persoon overeenkomstig dit artikel moet worden overgebracht daarvoor toestemming geeft, wordt die persoon, ongeacht zijn of haar nationaliteit, niet vervolgd of in detentie gesteld, noch aan enige andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid onderworpen op het grondgebied van de Staat waarnaar deze persoon wordt overgebracht, wegens feiten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de Staat vanwaar deze persoon werd overgebracht.   

### Artikel  14  

Een ieder die in detentie wordt gesteld of tegen wie andere maatregelen worden getroffen of een proces aanhangig wordt gemaakt op grond van dit Verdrag, heeft recht op een eerlijke behandeling, met inbegrip van het genot van alle rechten en waarborgen in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van de Staat op wiens grondgebied die persoon zich bevindt en de toepasselijke bepalingen van het internationaal recht, met inbegrip van die bepalingen die betrekking hebben op de rechten van de mens.  

### Artikel  15  

De Staten die Partij zijn werken samen ter voorkoming van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, met name door: 

a. alle uitvoerbare maatregelen te nemen, zonodig met inbegrip van aanpassing van hun nationale recht, ter voorkoming en verijdeling van voorbereidingen op hun respectieve grondgebieden die zijn gericht op het plegen, al dan niet op hun grondgebied, van deze strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van maatregelen tot het op hun grondgebied verbieden van illegale activiteiten van personen, groepen en organisaties die de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten aanmoedigen, uitlokken, organiseren, bewust financieren of plegen.  

b. in overeenstemming met hun nationale recht accurate en geverifieerde gegevens uit te wisselen, en bestuurlijke en andere passende maatregelen, ter voorkoming van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, te coördineren.  

c. indien van toepassing, onderzoek en ontwikkeling inzake de opsporingsmethoden van springstoffen en andere gevaarlijke stoffen die de dood of lichamelijk letsel kunnen veroorzaken, overleg over de ontwikkeling van normen voor het merken van springstoffen teneinde hun oorsprong te achterhalen bij onderzoek na explosie, uitwisseling van informatie inzake preventieve maatregelen, samenwerking, en overdracht van technologie, apparatuur en aanverwant materiaal.    

### Artikel  16  

De Staat die Partij is waar de vermoedelijke dader wordt vervolgd, deelt, in overeenstemming met zijn nationale wetgeving of de toepasselijke procedures, de afloop van de procedures mede aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die de inlichtingen zal mededelen aan de andere Staten die Partij zijn.  

### Artikel  17  

De Staten die Partij zijn komen hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag na op een wijze die in overeenstemming is met de beginselen van soevereine gelijkheid en territoriale integriteit van Staten en van non-interventie in de interne aangelegenheden van andere Staten.  

### Artikel  18  

Niets in dit Verdrag geeft een Staat die Partij is de bevoegdheid op het grondgebied van een andere Staat die Partij is rechtsmacht uit te oefenen en functies te vervullen die door zijn nationale wetgeving uitsluitend zijn voorbehouden aan de autoriteiten van die andere Staat die Partij is.  

### Artikel  19  

1.  Niets in dit Verdrag tast op enige wijze andere rechten, verplichtingen en verantwoordelijkheden aan van Staten en personen op grond van het internationaal recht, met name de doelstellingen en beginselen van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en het internationaal humanitair recht.   
2.  De handelingen van strijdkrachten tijdens een gewapend conflict als gedefinieerd in en onderworpen aan het internationaal humanitair recht vallen niet onder dit Verdrag, evenmin als de handelingen ondernomen door de strijdkrachten van een Staat bij de uitoefening van hun officiële taken, voorzover onderworpen aan andere bepalingen van internationaal recht.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  Elk geschil tussen twee of meer Staten die Partij zijn inzake de uitleg of toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen een redelijke termijn door onderhandelingen kan worden beslecht, wordt op verzoek van één van hen onderworpen aan arbitrage. Indien de partijen binnen zes maanden na de datum van het verzoek om arbitrage er niet in zijn geslaagd overeenstemming te bereiken over de regeling van deze arbitrage, kan ieder van deze partijen het geschil voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof door middel van een verzoek overeenkomstig het Statuut van het Hof.   
2.  Elke Staat kan op het tijdstip van ondertekening, bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van dit Verdrag, dan wel bij toetreding daartoe, verklaren dat hij zich niet gebonden acht door het eerste lid. De overige Staten die Partij zijn, zijn tegenover een Staat die Partij is en die dit voorbehoud heeft gemaakt niet gebonden door het eerste lid.   
3.  Een Staat die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt overeenkomstig het tweede lid, kan dit voorbehoud te allen tijde intrekken door middel van een kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.
