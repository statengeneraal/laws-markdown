####Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict

The High Contracting Parties, Recognizing that cultural property has suffered grave damage during recent armed conflicts and that, by reason of the developments in the technique of warfare, it is in increasing danger of destruction; Being convinced that damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world; Considering that the preservation of the cultural heritage is of great importance for all peoples of the world and that it is important that this heritage should receive international protection; Guided by the principles concerning the protection of cultural property during armed conflict, as established in the Conventions of The Hague of 1899 and of 1907 and in the Washington Pact of 15 April, 1935; Being of the opinion that such protection cannot be effective unless both national and international measures have been taken to organize it in time of peace; Being determined to take all possible steps to protect cultural property;   Have agreed upon the following provisions:

### Article  4  

####Respect for cultural property

1.  The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.   
2.  The obligations mentioned in paragraph 1 of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.   
3.  The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.   
4.  They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.

### Article  8  

####Granting of special protection

1.  There may be placed under special protection a limited number of refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict, of centres containing monuments and other immovable cultural property of very great importance, provided that they: 

(a) are situated at an adequate distance from any large industrial centre or from any important military objective constituting a vulnerable point, such as, for example, an aerodrome, broadcasting station, establishment engaged upon work of national defence, a port or railway station of relative importance or a main line of communication;

3.  A centre containing monuments shall be deemed to be used for military purposes whenever it is used for the movement of military personnel or material, even in transit. The same shall apply whenever activities directly connected with military operations, the stationing of military personnel, or the production of war material are carried on within the centre.   
4.  The guarding of cultural property mentioned in paragraph 1 above by armed custodians specially empowered to do so, or the presence, in the vicinity of such cultural property, of police forces normally responsible for the maintenance of public order shall not be deemed to be used for military purposes.   
5.  If any cultural property mentioned in paragraph 1 of the present Article is situated near an important military objective as defined in the said paragraph, it may nevertheless be placed under special protection if the High Contracting Party asking for that protection undertakes, in the event of armed conflict, to make no use of the objective and particularly, in the case of a port, railway station or aerodrome, to divert all traffic therefrom. In that event, such diversion shall be prepared in time of peace.   
6.  Special protection is granted to cultural property by its entry in the “International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection”.

### Article  9  

####Immunity of cultural property under special protection

The High Contracting Parties undertake to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection by refraining, from the time of entry in the International Register, from any act of hostility directed against such property and, except for the cases provided for in paragraph 5 of Article 8, from any use of such property or its surroundings for military purposes.  

### Article  10  

####Identification and control

During an armed conflict, cultural property under special protection shall be marked with the distinctive emblem described in Article 16, and shall be open to international control as provided for in the Regulations for the execution of the Convention.

####Withdrawal of immunity

1.  If one of the High Contracting Parties commits, in respect of any item of cultural property under special protection, a violation of the obligations under Article 9, the opposing Party shall, so long as this violation persists, be released from the obligation to ensure the immunity of the property concerned. Nevertheless, whenever possible, the latter Party shall first request the cessation of such violation within a reasonable time.   
2.  Apart from the case provided for in paragraph 1 of the present Article, immunity shall be withdrawn from cultural property under special protection only in exceptional cases of unavoidable military necessity, and only for such time as that necessity continues. Such necessity can be established only by the officer commanding a force the equivalent of a division in size or larger. Whenever circumstances permit, the opposing Party shall be notified, a reasonable time in advance, of the decision to withdraw immunity.   
3.  The Party withdrawing immunity shall, as soon as possible, so inform the Commissioner-General for cultural property provided for in the Regulations for the execution of the Convention, in writing, stating the reasons.

As far as possible, notification of transfer should be made to the opposing Parties. Nevertheless, transport conveying cultural property to the territory of another country may not display the distinctive emblem unless immunity has been expressly granted to it.   
2.  The High Contracting Parties shall take, so far as possible, the necessary precautions to avoid acts of hostility directed against the transport described in paragraph 1 of the present Article and displaying the distinctive emblem.   

### Article  14

1.  If, during an armed conflict, any High Contracting Party is induced by unforeseen circumstances to set up an improvised refuge and desires that it should be placed under special protection, it shall communicate this fact forthwith to the Commissioner-General accredited to that Party.   
2.  If the Commissioner-General considers that such a measure is justified by the circumstances and by the importance of the cultural property sheltered in this improvised refuge, he may authorize the High Contracting Party to display on such refuge the distinctive emblem defined in Article 16 of the Convention. He shall communicate his decision without delay to the delegates of the Protecting Powers who are concerned, each of whom may, within a time-limit of 30 days, order the immediate withdrawal of the emblem.   
3.  As soon as such delegates have signified their agreement or if the time-limit of 30 days has passed without any of the delegates concerned having made an objection, and if, in the view of the Commissioner-General, the refuge fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 8 of the Convention, the Commissioner-General shall request the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to enter the refuge in the Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection.   

### Article  12  

####International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection

1.  An “International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection” shall be prepared.   
2.  The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shall maintain this Register. He shall furnish copies to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the High Contracting Parties.   
3.  The Register shall be divided into sections, each in the name of a High Contracting Party. Each section shall be sub-divided into three paragraphs, headed: Refuges, Centres containing Monuments, Other Immovable Cultural Property. The Director-General shall determine what details each section shall contain.   

### Article  13  

####Requests for registration

1.  Any High Contracting Party may submit to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization an application for the entry in the Register of certain refuges, centres containing monuments or other immovable cultural property situated within its territory. Such application shall contain a description of the location of such property and shall certify that the property complies with the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention.   
2.  In the event of occupation, the Occupying Power shall be competent to make such application.   
3.  The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shall, without delay, send copies of applications for registration to each of the High Contracting Parties.   

### Article  14  

####Objections

1.  Any High Contracting Party may, by letter addressed to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, lodge an objection to the registration of cultural property. This letter must be received by him within four months of the day on which he sent a copy of the application for registration.   
2.  Such objection shall state the reasons giving rise to it, the only valid grounds being that: 

(a) the property is not cultural property;  

(b) the property does not comply with the conditions mentioned in Article 8 of the Convention.     
3.  The Director-General shall send a copy of the letter of objection to the High Contracting Parties without delay. He shall, if necessary, seek the advice of the International Committee on Monuments, Artistic and Historical Sites and Archaeological Excavations and also, if he thinks fit, of any other competent organization or person.   
4.  The Director-General, or the High Contracting Party requesting registration, may make whatever representations they deem necessary to the High Contracting Parties which lodged the objection, with a view to causing the objection to be withdrawn.   
5.  If a High Contracting Party which has made an application for registration in time of peace becomes involved in an armed conflict before the entry has been made, the cultural property concerned shall at once be provisionally entered in the Register, by the Director-General, pending the confirmation, withdrawal or cancellation of any objection that may be, or may have been, made.   
6.  If, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the letter of objection, the Director-General has not received from the High Contracting Party lodging the objection a communication stating that it has been withdrawn, the High Contracting Party applying for registration may request arbitration in accordance with the procedure in the following paragraph.   
7.  The request for arbitration shall not be made more than one year after the date of receipt by the Director-General of the letter of objection. Each of the two Parties to the dispute shall appoint an arbitrator. When more than one objection has been lodged against an application for registration, the High Contracting Parties which have lodged the objections shall, by common consent, appoint a single arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall select a chief arbitrator from the international list mentioned in Article 1 of the present Regulations. If such arbitrators cannot agree upon their choice, they shall ask the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint a chief arbitrator who need not necessarily be chosen from the international list. The arbitral tribunal thus constituted shall fix its own procedure. There shall be no appeal from its decisions.   
8.  Each of the High Contracting Parties may declare, whenever a dispute to which it is a Party arises, that it does not wish to apply the arbitration procedure provided for in the preceding paragraph. In such cases, the objection to an application for registration shall be submitted by the Director-General to the High Contracting Parties. The objection will be confirmed only if the High Contracting Parties so decide by a two-third majority of the High Contracting Parties voting. The vote shall be taken by correspondence, unless the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization deems it essential to convene a meeting under the powers conferred upon him by Article 27 of the Convention. If the Director-General decides to proceed with the vote by correspondence, he shall invite the High Contracting Parties to transmit their votes by sealed letter within six months from the day on which they were invited to do so.   

### Article  15  

####Registration

1.  The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shall cause to be entered in the Register, under a serial number, each item of property for which application for registration is made, provided that he has not received an objection within the time-limit prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 14.   
2.  If an objection has been lodged, and without prejudice to the provision of paragraph 5 of Article 14, the Director-General shall enter property in the Register only if the objection has been withdrawn or has failed to be confirmed following the procedures laid down in either paragraph 7 or paragraph 8 of Article 14.   
3.  Whenever paragraph 3 of Article 11 applies, the Director-General shall enter property in the Register if so requested by the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property.   
4.  The Director-General shall send without delay to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to the High Contracting Parties, and, at the request of the Party applying for registration, to all other States referred to in Articles 30 and 32 of the Convention, a certified copy of each entry in the Register. Entries shall become effective thirty days after despatch of such copies.   

### Article  16  

####Cancellation

1.  The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shall cause the registration of any property to be cancelled: 

(a) at the request of the High Contracting Party within whose territory the cultural property is situated;  

(b) if the High Contracting Party which requested registration has denounced the Convention, and when that denunciation has taken effect;  

(c) in the special case provided for in Article 14, paragraph 5, when an objection has been confirmed following the procedures mentioned either in paragraph 7 or in paragraph 8 of Article 14.     
2.  The Director-General shall send without delay, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to all States which received a copy of the entry in the Register, a certified copy of its cancellation. Cancellation shall take effect thirty days after the despatch of such copies.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####Transport of cultural property

### Article  17  

####Procedure to obtain immunity

1.  The request mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the Convention shall be addressed to the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property. It shall mention the reasons on which it is based and specify the approximate number and the importance of the objects to be transferred, their present location, the location now envisaged, the means of transport to be used, the route to be followed, the date proposed for the transfer, and any other relevant information.   
2.  If the Commissioner-General, after taking such opinions as he deems fit, considers that such transfer is justified, he shall consult those delegates of the Protecting Powers who are concerned, on the measures proposed for carrying it out. Following such consultation, he shall notify the Parties to the conflict concerned of the transfer, including in such notification all useful information.   
3.  The Commissioner-General shall appoint one or more inspectors, who shall satisfy themselves that only the property stated in the request is to be transferred and that the transport is to be by the approved methods and bears the distinctive emblem. The inspector or inspectors shall accompany the property to its destination.   

### Article  18  

####Transport abroad

Where the transfer under special protection is to the territory of another country, it shall be governed not only by Article 12 of the Convention and by Article 17 of the present Regulations, but by the following further provisions: 

(a) while the cultural property remains on the territory of another State, that State shall be its depositary and shall extend to it as great a measure of care as that which it bestows upon its own cultural property of comparable importance;  

(b) the depositary State shall return the property only on the cessation of the conflict; such return shall be effected within six months from the date on which it was requested;  

(c) during the various transfer operations, and while it remains on the territory of another State, the cultural property shall be exempt from confiscation and may not be disposed of either by the depositor or by the depositary. Nevertheless, when the safety of the property requires it, the depositary may, with the assent of the depositor, have the property transported to the territory of a third country, under the conditions laid down in the present Article;  

(d) the request for special protection shall indicate that the State to whose territory the property is to be transferred accepts the provisions of the present Article.    

### Article  19  

####Occupied territory

Whenever a High Contracting Party occupying territory of another High Contracting Party transfers cultural property to a refuge situated elsewhere in that territory, without being able to follow the procedure provided for in Article 17 of the Regulations, the transfer in question shall not be regarded as misappropriation within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention, provided that the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property certifies in writing, after having consulted the usual custodians, that such transfer was rendered necessary by circumstances.  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####The distinctive emblem

### Article  20  

####Affixing of the emblem

1.  The placing of the distinctive emblem and its degree of visibility shall be left to the discretion of the competent authorities of each High Contracting Party. It may be displayed on flags or armlets; it may be painted on an object or represented in any other appropriate form.   
2.  However, without prejudice to any possible fuller markings, the emblem shall, in the event of armed conflict and in the cases mentioned in Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention, be placed on the vehicles of transport so as to be clearly visible in daylight from the air as well as from the ground. The emblem shall be visible from the ground: 

(a) at regular intervals sufficient to indicate clearly the perimeter of a centre containing monuments under special protection;  

(b) at the entrance to other immovable cultural property under special protection.     

### Article  21  

####Identification of persons

1.  The persons mentioned in Article 17, paragraph 2 (*b*) and (*c*) of the Convention may wear an armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and stamped by the competent authorities.   
2.  Such persons shall carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card shall mention at least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the title or rank, and the function of the holder. The card shall bear the photograph of the holder as well as his signature or his fingerprints, or both. It shall bear the embossed stamp of the competent authorities.   
3.  Each High Contracting Party shall make out its own type of identity card, guided by the model annexed, by way of example, to the present Regulations. The High Contracting Parties shall transmit to each other a specimen of the model they are using. Identity cards shall be made out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by the issuing Power.   
4.  The said persons may not, without legitimate reason, be deprived of their identity card or of the right to wear the armlet.   ![10000054633](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054633)

### Artikel  2  

####Bescherming van culturele goederen

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag omvat de bescherming van culturele goederen zowel de veiligstelling als de eerbiediging van deze goederen.  

### Artikel  3  

####Veiligstelling van culturele goederen

### Artikel  4  

####Eerbiediging van culturele goederen

1.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich, zowel de culturele goederen welke zich op haar eigen grondgebied bevinden als die, welke zich bevinden op het grondgebied van andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, te eerbiedigen door zich te onthouden van ieder gebruik van deze goederen en van hun onmiddellijke omgeving of van de middelen voor hun bescherming, voor doeleinden, welke deze goederen aan vernietiging of beschadiging zouden kunnen blootstellen in geval van een gewapend conflict, en door zich te onthouden van iedere tegen zulke goederen gerichte vijandelijke daad.   
2.  Van de verplichtingen, omschreven in lid 1 van dit artikel, kan alleen worden afgeweken, indien een militaire noodzaak een dergelijke afwijking gebiedend vereist.   
3.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich bovendien, iedere vorm van diefstal, plundering of ontvreemding van, en iedere daad van vandalisme gericht tegen, culturele goederen te verbieden, te voorkomen en er zo nodig een eind aan te maken. Zij zullen zich ervan onthouden roerende culturele goederen, welke zich bevinden op het grondgebied van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, te vorderen.

5.  Een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij kan zich ten aanzien van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij niet onttrekken aan de krachtens dit artikel op haar rustende verplichtingen op grond van de overweging, dat deze laatste de in artikel 3 bedoelde maatregelen tot veiligstelling niet heeft toegepast.   

### Artikel  5  

####Bezetting

1.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, die het grondgebied van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij geheel of gedeeltelijk bezet houden, moeten zoveel mogelijk steun verlenen aan de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten van het bezette gebied met betrekking tot de veiligstelling en instandhouding van zijn culturele goederen.   
2.  Indien het noodzakelijk mocht blijken maatregelen te nemen voor de instandhouding van in bezet gebied gelegen culturele goederen, welke als gevolg van militaire operaties zijn beschadigd, en indien de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten niet in staat mochten zijn, dergelijke maatregelen te nemen, moet de bezettende mogendheid zoveel mogelijk, en in nauwe samenwerking met die autoriteiten, die maatregelen tot instandhouding nemen welke het meest noodzakelijk zijn.   
3.  Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, welker regering door de leden van een verzetsorganisatie als hun rechtmatige regering wordt beschouwd, moet, indien dit mogelijk is, de aandacht van deze leden vestigen op de verplichting die bepalingen van het Verdrag, welke betrekking hebben op de eerbiediging van culturele goederen, in acht te nemen.   

### Artikel  6  

####Aanduiding van culturele goederen

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich, reeds in vredestijd in de bij haar strijdkrachten in gebruik zijnde reglementen of instructies, bepalingen op te nemen, welke ten doel hebben de naleving van dit Verdrag te verzekeren, en bij de leden van haar strijdkrachten een geest van eerbied aan te kweken voor de cultuur en de culturele goederen van alle volkeren.   
2.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich reeds in vredestijd bij haar strijdkrachten diensten in te stellen of deskundig personeel aan te stellen of een en ander voor te bereiden, welke diensten of welk personeel tot taak zullen hebben te zorgen voor de eerbiediging van culturele goederen en samen te werken met de burgerlijke autoriteiten, welke belast zijn met de veiligstelling van deze goederen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Bijzondere bescherming

### Artikel  8  

####Verlenen van bijzondere bescherming

1.  Onder bijzondere bescherming kunnen worden gesteld een beperkt aantal schuilplaatsen, bestemd om bescherming te bieden aan roerende culturele goederen in geval van een gewapend conflict, monumenten-centra en andere onroerende culturele goederen van zeer grote betekenis, op voorwaarde dat zij: 

a) zich bevinden op voldoende afstand van een groot industrieel centrum of van enig belangrijk militair object, dat een kwetsbaar punt vormt, zoals bijvoorbeeld een vliegveld, een radiozendstation, een inrichting werkzaam voor de nationale verdediging, een haven of een spoorwegstation van zeker belang of een belangrijke verkeers- of waterweg of spoorlijn;  

b) niet worden gebruikt voor militaire doeleinden.     
2.  Een schuilplaats voor roerende culturele goederen kan eveneens onder bijzondere bescherming worden geplaatst, ongeacht de ligging, als zij zodanig is gebouwd, dat zij naar alle waarschijnlijkheid niet door bommen kan worden beschadigd.   
3.  Een monumenten-centrum wordt geacht voor militaire doeleinden te worden gebruikt als van dit centrum gebruik wordt gemaakt voor de verplaatsing van militair personeel of materieel, zelfs ingeval van doorvoer. Dit is eveneens het geval wanneer in dat centrum werkzaamheden worden verricht, welke rechtstreeks verband houden met militaire operaties, de legering van militair personeel of de vervaardiging van oorlogsmaterieel.   
4.  Het bewaken van in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde culturele goederen door gewapende bewakers, die daartoe speciaal zijn gemachtigd, of de aanwezigheid in de nabijheid van dergelijke culturele goederen van politietroepen, welke normaal belast zijn met het handhaven van de openbare orde, wordt niet beschouwd als gebruik voor militaire doeleinden.   
5.  Indien een van de in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde culturele goederen is gelegen in de nabijheid van een belangrijk militair object als omschreven in dat lid, kan het niettemin onder bijzondere bescherming worden geplaatst, indien de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, welke het verzoek doet, zich verbindt in geval van een gewapend conflict geen gebruik van het betrokken militair object te maken en in het bijzonder, als het een haven, een station of een vliegveld betreft, het verkeer zodanig te verleggen dat van die haven en van dat station of vliegveld geen gebruik wordt gemaakt. In dat geval moet deze verlegging reeds in vredestijd worden voorbereid.   
6.  De bijzondere bescherming wordt aan culturele goederen verleend door hun inschrijving in het „Internationale register van culturele goederen onder bijzondere bescherming”. Deze inschrijving kan slechts geschieden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en onder de voorwaarden neergelegd in het Reglement van Uitvoering.   

### Artikel  9  

####Onschendbaarheid van culturele goederen onder bijzondere bescherming

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich de onschendbaarheid van culturele goederen onder bijzondere bescherming te verzekeren door zich, van het ogenblik van inschrijving in het Internationale Register af, te onthouden van iedere tegen zodanige goederen gerichte vijandelijke daad en, behalve in de gevallen voorzien in artikel 8, lid 5, van elk gebruik van die goederen of van hun omgeving voor militaire doeleinden.  

### Artikel  10  

####Aanduiding en contrôle

Gedurende een gewapend conflict moeten de culturele goederen onder bijzondere bescherming voorzien zijn van het in artikel 16 omschreven kenteken en open staan voor een internationale contrôle, zoals voorzien in het Reglement van Uitvoering.  

### Artikel  11  

####Opheffing van de onschendbaarheid

1.  Indien een van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot een cultureel goed onder bijzondere bescherming een van de op grond van artikel 9 op haar rustende verplichtingen schendt, is de Wederpartij, zolang deze schending voortduurt, ontheven van haar verplichting de onschendbaarheid van het betrokken goed te verzekeren. Nochtans zal laatstbedoelde Partij, wanneer zulks enigszins mogelijk is, te voren eisen, dat binnen een redelijke termijn een einde wordt gemaakt aan de schending.   
2.  Behalve in het geval, voorzien in lid 1 van dit artikel, kan de onschendbaarheid van een cultureel goed onder bijzondere bescherming slechts worden opgeheven in uitzonderlijke gevallen van onvermijdelijke militaire noodzaak en slechts zolang deze noodzaak voortduurt. Deze noodzaak kan slechts worden vastgesteld door de bevelhebber van een formatie gelijk aan of groter dan een divisie. In alle gevallen, waarin de omstandigheden dit toelaten, zal de Wederpartij tijdig van te voren in kennis worden gesteld van de beslissing, dat de onschendbaarheid wordt opgeheven.   
3.  De Partij, die de onschendbaarheid opheft, dient daarvan zo spoedig mogelijk, schriftelijk, en met opgave van redenen, kennis te geven aan de Commissaris-Generaal voor culturele goederen bedoeld in het Reglement van Uitvoering.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Vervoer van culturele goederen

### Artikel  12  

####Vervoer onder bijzondere bescherming

1.  Vervoer uitsluitend beperkt tot het overbrengen van culturele goederen, hetzij binnen een grondgebied, hetzij naar een ander grondgebied, kan, op verzoek van de betrokken Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, geschieden onder bijzondere bescherming volgens de voorwaarden omschreven in het Reglement van Uitvoering.   
2.  Vervoer onder bijzondere bescherming vindt plaats onder het internationaal toezicht voorzien in het Reglement van Uitvoering. Het transport zal voorzien zijn van het in artikel 16 omschreven kenteken.   
3.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen zich onthouden van iedere vijandelijke daad gericht tegen een transport onder bijzondere bescherming.   

### Artikel  13  

####Vervoer in spoedeisende gevallen

1.  Indien een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij van oordeel is, dat de veiligheid van bepaalde culturele goederen vereist, dat zij naar elders worden overgebracht en dat de noodzaak hiervan zo dringend is, dat de in artikel 12 voorgeschreven procedure niet kan worden gevolgd, in het bijzonder in het begin van een gewapend conflict, mag het transport worden voorzien van het in artikel 16 omschreven kenteken, tenzij een aanvraag tot het verlenen van onschendbaarheid bedoeld in artikel 12 is ingediend en deze aanvraag is geweigerd. Voor zover mogelijk moet van het transport kennis worden gegeven aan de Wederpartijen. Niettemin mag een transport van culturele goederen naar het grondgebied van een ander land niet voorzien zijn van het kenteken, tenzij de onschendbaarheid aan dit transport uitdrukkelijk is verleend.   
2.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen zoveel mogelijk de noodzakelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen treffen teneinde de in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde transporten, welke voorzien zijn van het kenteken, te beveiligen tegen daartegen gerichte vijandelijke daden.   

### Artikel  14  

####Onschendbaarheid met betrekking tot inbeslagneming, buitmaking en verbeurdverklaring

1.  Onschendbaarheid met betrekking tot inbeslagneming, buitmaking en verbeurdverklaring wordt verleend aan: 

a) culturele goederen, die de bescherming genieten bedoeld in artikel 12 of die bedoeld in artikel 13;  

b) vervoermiddelen uitsluitend bestemd voor het overbrengen van die goederen.     
2.  Het bepaalde in dit artikel beperkt op geen enkele wijze het recht van inspectie en visitatie.   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Het personeel

### Artikel  15  

####Personeel

Personeel belast met de bescherming van culturele goederen moet, voorzover dit verenigbaar is met de eisen welke de veiligheid stelt, worden geëerbiedigd in het belang van die goederen en moet, indien het in handen van de Wederpartij valt, zijn functie kunnen blijven uitoefenen, in alle gevallen, waarin de culturele goederen, waarvoor het verantwoordelijk is, eveneens in handen van de Wederpartij zijn gevallen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Het kenteken

### Artikel  16  

####Kenteken van het Verdrag

1.  Het kenteken van het Verdrag bestaat uit een schild, puntig aan de onderzijde, schuin gevierendeeld in koningsblauw en wit (een schild gevormd door een koningsblauw vierkant, waarvan een van de hoeken de punt van het schild vormt en door een koningsblauwe driehoek boven het vierkant, zodanig dat aan beide zijden een witte driehoek overblijft).

Indien een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, na in vredestijd de inschrijving in het Register van een cultureel goed te hebben aangevraagd, bij een gewapend conflict wordt betrokken voordat de inschrijving heeft plaatsgevonden, zal het betrokken culturele goed onmiddellijk, doch voorlopig, in het Register worden ingeschreven door de Directeur-Generaal, in afwachting van de bevestiging, intrekking of afwijzing van elk bezwaar dat eventueel is of wordt ingediend.   
6.  Indien binnen een termijn van zes maanden, te rekenen van de dag, waarop hij het bezwaarschrift heeft ontvangen, de Directeur-Generaal van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, die bezwaar heeft gemaakt, geen mededeling ontvangt meldende dat dit bezwaar is ingetrokken, kan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, die een aanvraag tot inschrijving heeft ingediend, een scheidsrechterlijke uitspraak verzoeken in overeenstemming met de in het volgende lid vermelde procedure.   
7.  Het verzoek om een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing moet gedaan worden ten hoogste een jaar na de datum waarop de Directeur-Generaal het bezwaarschrift heeft ontvangen. Elke Partij bij het geschil wijst een scheidsrechter aan. Indien het verzoek om inschrijving van de zijde van meer dan een Partij bezwaar ontmoet, wijzen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, die bezwaar hebben gemaakt, tezamen één scheidsrechter aan. De beide scheidsrechters kiezen, aan de hand van de internationale lijst bedoeld in artikel 1 van dit Reglement, een derde scheidsrechter, die als voorzitter zal optreden; indien de scheidsrechters niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen ten aanzien van hun keuze, vragen zij de President van het Internationaal Gerechtshof, een derde scheidsrechter aan te wijzen, die niet noodzakelijkerwijs op de internationale lijst behoeft voor te komen. Het aldus gevormde scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedure vast; van zijn uitspraken is geen hoger beroep mogelijk.   
8.  Elk der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen kan, wanneer zich een geschil voordoet waarbij zij partij is, verklaren, dat zij de scheidsrechterlijke procedure, welke voorzien is in het vorige lid, niet wenst toe te passen. In dat geval wordt het bezwaar tegen een verzoek om inschrijving door de Directeur-Generaal voorgelegd aan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen. Het bezwaar wordt slechts bevestigd, indien de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen daartoe besluiten met een tweederde meerderheid der aan de stemming deelnemende Partijen. De stemming zal plaatsvinden door middel van correspondentie, tenzij de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur het nodig oordeelt een vergadering bijeen te roepen krachtens de bevoegdheid, welke hem is verleend bij artikel 27 van het Verdrag. Indien de Directeur-Generaal besluit, de stemming bij correspondentie te houden, zal hij de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verzoeken hem haar stem te doen toekomen onder verzegeld couvert binnen een termijn van zes maanden te rekenen van de dag, waarop het verzoek daartoe tot hen zal zijn gericht.   

### Artikel  15  

####Inschrijving

1.  De Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur laat elk cultureel goed, ten aanzien waarvan een verzoek tot inschrijving gedaan is, onder een volgnummer in het Register inschrijven, indien tegen dit verzoek, binnen de termijn voorzien in het eerste lid van artikel 14, geen bezwaar is gemaakt.   
2.  Ingeval een bezwaar is ingediend, en onverminderd het vermelde in lid 5 van artikel 14, gaat de Directeur-Generaal slechts over tot inschrijving van het goed in het Register, indien het bezwaar is ingetrokken of indien het niet is bevestigd ingevolge de procedures, bedoeld in hetzij lid 7, hetzij lid 8 van artikel 14.   
3.  In het geval, bedoeld in lid 3 van artikel 11, verricht de Directeur-Generaal de inschrijving op verzoek van de Commissaris-Generaal voor culturele goederen.   
4.  De Directeur-Generaal zendt onverwijld aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, aan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en, indien de Partij die om de inschrijving heeft gevraagd zulks verzoekt, aan alle andere Staten, bedoeld in artikel 30 en 32 van het Verdrag, een gewaarmerkt afschrift van elke inschrijving in het Register. De inschrijving wordt van kracht dertig dagen na deze verzending.   

### Artikel  16  

####Doorhaling in het Register

1.  De Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur laat de inschrijving van een cultureel goed in het Register doorhalen: 

a) op verzoek van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, op welker grondgebied het culturele goed zich bevindt;  

b) indien de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, die om inschrijving had verzocht, het Verdrag heeft opgezegd en wanneer deze opzegging van kracht is geworden;  

c) in het speciale geval voorzien in lid 5 van artikel 14, wanneer een bezwaar is bevestigd op grond van de procedure bedoeld in hetzij lid 7, hetzij in lid 8 van artikel 14.     
2.  De Directeur-Generaal zendt onverwijld aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en aan alle Staten, die afschrift van de inschrijving hebben ontvangen, een gewaarmerkt afschrift van de doorhaling van deze inschrijving in het Register. De doorhaling wordt van kracht 30 dagen na deze verzending.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Vervoer van culturele goederen

### Artikel  17  

####Procedure ter verkrijging van onschendbaarheid

1.  Het verzoek, bedoeld in lid 1 van artikel 12 van het Verdrag, wordt gericht tot de Commissaris-Generaal voor culturele goederen. Het moet de redenen vermelden die aan het verzoek ten grondslag liggen en het geschatte aantal en de belangrijkheid opgeven der te vervoeren culturele goederen, de plaats waar deze goederen zich thans bevinden, de plaats waarheen zij zouden moeten worden overgebracht, de te gebruiken middelen van vervoer, de te volgen weg, de datum waarop wordt voorgesteld het vervoer te doen plaatsvinden en alle andere inlichtingen welke van belang kunnen zijn.   
2.  Indien de Commissaris-Generaal, na de adviezen te hebben ingewonnen welke hij nodig acht, van oordeel is dat dit vervoer gerechtvaardigd is, raadpleegt hij de betrokken afgevaardigden der beschermende mogendheden omtrent de maatregelen, welke zijn voorgesteld om het vervoer ten uitvoer te leggen. Na deze raadpleging doet hij mededeling van het vervoer aan de Partijen, die bij het conflict betrokken zijn en voegt aan deze mededeling alle inlichtingen toe, welke van nut kunnen zijn.   
3.  De Commissaris-Generaal wijst een of meer inspecteurs aan, die nagaan of het transport uitsluitend de goederen omvat vermeld in het verzoek, of het vervoer plaats heeft op de goedgekeurde wijze, en of het transport voorzien is van het kenteken. De inspecteur of inspecteurs vergezellen het transport tot de plaats van bestemming.   

### Artikel  18  

####Vervoer naar het buitenland

Als de overbrenging onder bijzondere bescherming plaatsvindt naar het grondgebied van een ander land, is deze overbrenging niet alleen onderworpen aan artikel 12 van het Verdrag en aan artikel 17 van dit Reglement, maar ook aan de volgende bepalingen: 

a) Gedurende de tijd, dat culturele goederen op het grondgebied van een andere Staat verblijven, zal deze er de bewaarder van zijn. Aan het bewaren van deze goederen zal hij minstens evenveel zorg moeten besteden als aan zijn eigen culturele goederen van vergelijkbare belangrijkheid.  

b) De Staat, welke als bewaarder optreedt, geeft deze goederen slechts na beëindiging van het conflict terug; deze teruggave vindt plaats binnen een termijn van zes maanden nadat het verzoek om teruggave is gedaan.  

c) Gedurende de verschillende transporten en tijdens hun verblijf op het grondgebied van een andere Staat, zijn de culturele goederen beschermd tegen inbeslagneming en er mag niet over hen worden beschikt noch door de inbewaringgever noch door de inbewaringnemer. Wanneer echter de veiligheid der goederen zulks vereist, kan de inbewaringnemer met toestemming van de inbewaringgever de goederen doen overbrengen naar het grondgebied van een derde land, onder de voorwaarden omschreven in dit artikel.  

d) Het verzoek om bijzondere bescherming moet vermelden dat de Staat, naar wiens grondgebied het vervoer zal plaatsvinden, de bepalingen van dit artikel aanvaardt.    

### Artikel  19  

####Bezet gebied

Wanneer een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, welke het grondgebied van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij bezet houdt, culturele goederen vervoert naar een elders op dat grondgebied gelegen schuilplaats, zonder de procedure te kunnen volgen, voorzien in artikel 17 van het Reglement, wordt genoemd transport niet beschouwd als een ontvreemding in de zin van artikel 4 van het Verdrag, indien de Commissaris-Generaal voor culturele goederen schriftelijk verklaart, na het normale beschermingspersoneel te hebben geraadpleegd, dat de omstandigheden dit vervoer noodzakelijk maakten.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Kenteken

### Artikel  20  

####Het aanbrengen van het kenteken

1.  Het bepalen van de plaats waar het kenteken moet worden aangebracht en van de graad van zichtbaarheid van het kenteken wordt overgelaten aan de beoordeling der bevoegde instanties van elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij. Het kenteken kan met name voorkomen op vlaggen of banden om de arm. Het kan op een voorwerp worden geschilderd of op elke andere passende wijze worden aangebracht.   
2.  In geval van gewapend conflict, en in de gevallen voorzien bij de artikelen 12 en 13 van het Verdrag, moet het kenteken echter, onverminderd de mogelijkheid van een eventueel vollediger aanduiding, op zodanige wijze op de transportmiddelen worden aangebracht dat het overdag goed zichtbaar is, zowel uit de lucht als op de grond. Het kenteken moet op de grond zichtbaar zijn: 

a) op onderling gelijke afstanden voldoende om op duidelijke wijze de omtrek aan te geven van een monumenten-centrum onder bijzondere bescherming;  

b) bij de ingang van andere onroerende culturele goederen onder bijzondere bescherming.     

### Artikel  21  

####Identificatie van personen

1.  De personen bedoeld in artikel 17 van het Verdrag, lid 2 (*b*) en *(c),* mogen om de arm een band dragen voorzien van het kenteken, afgegeven en gestempeld door de bevoegde autoriteiten.   
2.  Zij dragen een speciaal identiteitsbewijs bij zich dat voorzien is van het kenteken. Dit bewijs vermeldt ten minste naam en voornamen, geboortedatum, titel of rang en de functie van de houder. Het bewijs is voorzien van de foto van de houder en, bovendien, hetzij van zijn handtekening, hetzij van zijn vingerafdrukken, of van beide tegelijk. Het bewijs draagt het droogstempel der bevoegde autoriteiten.   
3.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij stelt haar eigen identiteitsbewijs vast, waarbij zij uitgaat van het model, dat bij wijze van voorbeeld bij dit Reglement is gevoegd. De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen doen elkander voorbeelden toekomen van het model, dat zij gebruiken. Identiteitsbewijzen worden zo mogelijk ten minste in twee exemplaren opgemaakt, waarvan er een bewaard wordt door de mogendheid welke deze heeft afgegeven.   
4.  Het identiteitsbewijs van de hierboven genoemde personen mag, behoudens geldige reden, hun niet worden ontnomen, terwijl hun evenmin het recht mag worden ontnomen de band om de arm te dragen.   ![10000054633](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054633)
