##Verdrag inzake de bescherming van trekkende wilde diersoorten

####Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals

The Contracting Parties, Recognizing that wild animals in their innumerable forms are an irreplaceable part of the earth's natural system which must be conserved for the good of mankind; Aware that each generation of man holds the resources of the earth for future generations and has an obligation to ensure that this legacy is conserved and, where utilized, is used wisely; Conscious of the ever-growing value of wild animals from environmental, ecological, genetic, scientific, aesthetic, recreational, cultural, educational, social and economic points of view; Concerned particularly with those species of wild animals that migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries; Recognizing that the States are and must be the protectors of the migratory species of wild animals that live within or pass through their national jurisdictional boundaries; Convinced that conservation and effective management of migratory species of wild animals require the concerted action of all States within the national jurisdictional boundaries of which such species spend any part of their life cycle; Recalling Recommendation 32 of the Action Plan adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) and noted with satisfaction by the Twenty-seventh Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations;   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

####Interpretation

1.  For the purpose of this Convention: 

a) “Migratory species” means the entire population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, a significant proportion of whose members cyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries;  

b) “Conservation status of a migratory species” means the sum of the influences acting on the migratory species that may affect its long-term distribution and abundance;  

c) “Conservation status” will be taken as “favourable” when: 

(1) Population dynamics data indicate that the migratory species is maintaining itself on a long-term basis as a viable component of its ecosystems;  

(2) the range of the migratory species is neither currently being reduced, nor is likely to be reduced, on a long-term basis;  

(3) there is, and will be in the foreseeable future, sufficient habitat to maintain the population of the migratory species on a long-term basis; and  

(4) the distribution and abundance of the migratory species approach historic coverage and levels to the extent that potentially suitable ecosystems exist and to the extent consistent with wise wildlife management;    

d) “Conservation status” will be taken as “unfavourable” if any of the conditions set out in sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph is not met;  

e) “Endangered” in relation to a particular migratory species means that the migratory species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range;  

f) “Range” means all the areas of land or water that a migratorv species inhabits, stays in temporarily, crosses or overflies at any time on its normal migration route;  

g) “Habitat” means any area in the range of a migratory species which contains suitable living conditions for that species;  

h) “Range State” in relation to a particular migratory species means any State (and where appropriate any other Party referred to under sub-paragraph (k) of this paragraph) that exercises jurisdiction over any part of the range of that migratory species, or a State, flag vessels of which are engaged outside national jurisdictional limits in taking that migratory species;  

i) “Taking” means taking, hunting, fishing, capturing, harassing, berate killing, or attempting to engage in any such conduct;  

j) “Agreement” means an international agreement relating to the conservation of one or more migratory species as provided for in Articles IV and V of this Convention; and  

k) “Party” means a State or any regional economic integration organization constituted by sovereign States which has competence in respect of the negotiation, conclusion and application of international agreements in matters covered by this Convention for which this Convention is in force.     
2.  In matters within their competence, the regional economic integration organizations which are Parties to this Convention shall in their own name exercise the rights and fulfil the responsibilities which this Convention attributes to their member States. In such cases the member States of these organizations shall not be entitled to exercise such rights individually.   
3.  Where this Convention provides for a decision to be taken by either a two-thirds majority or a unanimous decision of “the Parties present and voting” this shall mean “the Parties present and casting an affirmative or negative vote”. Those abstaining from voting shall not be counted amongst “the Parties present and voting” in determining the majority.   

### Article  II  

####Fundamental Principles

1.  The Parties acknowledge the importance of migratory species being conserved and of Range States agreeing to take action to this end whenever possible and appropriate, paying special attention to migratory species the conservation status of which is unfavourable, and taking individually or in co-operation appropriate and necessary steps to conserve such species and their habitat.   
2.  The Parties acknowledge the need to take action to avoid any migratory species becoming endangered.   
3.  In particular, the Parties: 

a) should promote, co-operate in our support research relating to migratory species;  

b) shall endeavour to provide immediate protection for migratory species included in Appendix I; and  

c) shall endeavour to conclude agreements covering the conservation and management of migratory species included in Appendix II.     

### Article  III  

####Endangered Migratory Species: Appendix I

1.  Appendix I shall list migratory species which are endangered.   
2.  A migratory species may be listed in Appendix I provided that reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available, indicates that the species is endangered.   
3.  A migratory species may be removed from Appendix I when the Conference of the Parties determines that: 

a) reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available, indicates that the species is no longer endangered, and  

b) the species is not likely to become endangered again because of loss of protection due to its removal from Appendix I.     
4.  Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I shall endeavour: 

a) to conserve and, where feasible and appropriate, restore those habitats of the species which are of importance in removing the species from danger of extinction;  

b) to prevent, remove, compensate for or minimize, as appropriate, the adverse effects of activities or obstacles that seriously impede or prevent the migration of the species; and  

c) to the extent feasible and appropriate, to prevent, reduce or control factors that are endangering or are likely to further endanger the species, including strictly controlling the introduction of, or controlling or eliminating, already introduced exotic species.     
5.  Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I shall prohibit the taking of animals belonging to such species. Exceptions may be made to this prohibition only if: 

a) the taking is for scientific purposes;  

b) the taking is for the purpose of enhancing the propagation or survival of the affected species;  

c) the taking is to accommodate the needs of traditional subsistence users of such species; or  

d) extraordinary circumstances so require:   provided that such exceptions are precise as to content and limited in space and time. Such taking should not operate to the disadvantage of the species.   
6.  The Conference of the Parties may recommend to the Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I that they take further measures considered appropriate to benefit the species.   
7.  The Parties shall as soon as possible inform the Secretariat of any exceptions made pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.   

### Article  IV  

####Migratory Species to be the Subject of Agreements: Appendix II

1.  Appendix II shall list migratory species which have an unfavourable conservation status and which require international agreements for their conservation and management, as well as those which have a conservation status which would significantly benefit from the international co-operation that could be achieved by an international agreement.   
2.  If the circumstances so warrant, a migratory species may be listed both in Appendix I and Appendix II.   
3.  Parties that are Range States of migratory species listed in Appendix II shall endeavour to conclude agreements where these would benefit the species and should give priority to those species in an unfavourable conservation status.   
4.  Parties are encouraged to take action with a view to concluding agreements for any population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, members of which periodically cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries.   
5.  The Secretariat shall be provided with a copy of each Agreement concluded pursuant to the provision of this Article.   

### Article  V  

####Guidelines for Agreements

1.  The object of each Agreement shall be to restore the migratory species concerned to a favourable conservation status or to maintain it in such a status. Each Agreement should deal with those aspects of the conservation and management of the migratory species concerned which serve to achieve that object.   
2.  Each Agreement should cover the whole of the range of the migratory species concerned and should be open to accession by all Range States of that species, whether or not they are Parties to this Convention.

### Appendix  II  

####Interpretation

1. Migratory species included in this Appendix are referred to: 

a) by the name of the species or subspecies; or  

b) as being all of the migratory species included in a higher taxon or designated part thereof.   Unless otherwise indicated, where reference is made to a taxon higher than species, it is understood that all the migratory species within that taxon could significantly benefit from the conclusion of AGREEMENTS.  

2. The abbreviation “spp.” following the name of a Family or Genus is used to denote all migratory species within that Family or Genus.  

3. Other references to taxa higher than species are for the purposes of information or classification only.  

4. The abbreviation “(s.l.)” is used to indicate that the scientific name is used in its extended meaning.  

5. An asterisk (*) placed against the name of a species or higher taxon indicates that the species, or a separate population of that species, or one or more species included in that higher taxon is included in Appendix I.

####Verdrag inzake de bescherming van trekkende wilde diersoorten

De Verdragsluitende Partijen, Erkennende dat wilde dieren in hun geweldige vormenrijkdom waarin zij voorkomen een onvervangbaar bestanddeel zijn van de natuurlijke systemen der aarde, die voor het welzijn van de mens behouden dienen te worden; Zich ervan bewust dat iedere menselijke generatie verantwoordelijkheid draagt voor de rijkdommen der aarde voor de komende generaties en tot taak heeft ervoor te zorgen dat dit erfgoed wordt behouden en dat, wanneer hiervan gebruik wordt gemaakt, zulks op verstandige wijze geschiedt; Zich bewust van de steeds toenemende betekenis van wilde dieren, voor ons leefmilieu en vanuit ecologisch, genetisch, wetenschappelijk, esthetisch, recreatief, cultureel, educatief, sociaal en economisch oogpunt; Bezorgd, met name, over die wilde dieren die tijdens hun trek landsgrenzen passeren, of bepaalde landen verlaten; Erkennende dat op de Staten de plicht rust de trekkende soorten wilde dieren die binnen hun landsgrenzen leven of hun landen passeren, te beschermen; Ervan overtuigd dat een doeltreffend behoud en beheer van de trekkende soorten van wilde dieren om gezamenlijke maatregelen vraagt van de zijde van alle Staten binnen de landsgrenzen waarvan deze soorten een deel van hun levenscyclus doorbrengen; Herinnerend aan Aanbeveling 32 van het Actieplan, aanvaard door de Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties over het Leefmilieu (Stockholm, 1972), waarvan de zevenentwintigste zitting van de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties met voldoening heeft kennis genomen;   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

####Uitlegging

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag, wordt verstaan onder: 

a. „Trekkende soorten”: de gehele populatie of een geografisch gescheiden deel van de populatie van een bepaalde soort of lager taxon wilde dieren, waarvan een belangrijk gedeelte één of meer landsgrenzen periodiek en op een te voorziene wijze overschrijdt;  

b. „Mate en aard van de bescherming van een trekkende soort”: het geheel van invloeden waaraan de trekkende soort is blootgesteld en dat op lange termijn de verspreiding ervan en de omvang van haar populatie kan beïnvloeden;  

c. „De mate en aard van de bescherming” wordt als „gunstig” beschouwd wanneer: 

1. de gegevens betreffende de populatiedynamiek van de desbetreffende trekkende soort erop wijzen dat deze soort - op de lange termijn - handhaaft als een levensvatbaar bestanddeel van de ecosystemen waartoe zij behoort;  

2. de omvang van het verspreidingsgebied van deze trekkende soort niet inkrimpt en ook op lange termijn niet kleiner dreigt te worden;  

3. er een leefgebied van voldoende omvang aanwezig is en ook in een te voorziene toekomst zal blijven bestaan, waar de populatie van deze trekkende soort zich op lange termijn zal kunnen handhaven; en  

4. de verspreiding en de populatiegrootte van deze trekkende soort ongeveer even groot zijn als in het verleden, voor zover er voor deze soort in wezen geschikte ecosystemen bestaan en voor zover een en ander verenigbaar is met een verstandig beheer van de wilde dieren en hun leefgebieden;    

d. „De mate en de aard van de bescherming” wordt als „niet-gunstig” beschouwd indien aan één van de onder letter c hierboven genoemde voorwaarden niet is voldaan;  

e. betekent „bedreigd” ten aanzien van een bepaalde trekkende soort dat deze binnen haar gehele verspreidingsgebied of op een belangrijk gedeelte daarvan dreigt uit te sterven;  

f. betekent „verspreidingsgebied” alle land- en wateromvattende gebieden waarbinnen een trekkende soort leeft of tijdelijk verblijft of waardoor zij trekt of waarover zij vliegt op een bepaald moment op de gebruikelijke trekroute;  

g. betekent „leefgebied” ieder gebied binnen het verspreidingsgebied van een trekkende soort, waar de voor deze soort geschikte levensomstandigheden aanwezig zijn;  

h. betekent „Staat die deel uitmaakt van het verspreidingsgebied”, ten aanzien van een bepaalde trekkende soort, iedere Staat (en eventueel iedere andere Partij, bedoeld onder letter k hieronder), die rechtsbevoegdheid uitoefent over enigerlei deel van het verspreidingsgebied van die trekkende soort of ook een Staat waarvan de schepen de vlag van die Staat voeren en die buiten de landsgrenzen worden ingezet om dieren aan de populatie van die soort te onttrekken;  

i. wordt onder „het onttrekken van dieren aan de populatie” verstaan het onttrekken, jagen, vissen, vangen, opjagen, opzettelijk doden of het trachten één van de bovengenoemde handelingen te verrichten;  

j. wordt onder „overeenkomst” verstaan een internationale overeenkomst strekkende tot het behoud van één of meer trekkende soorten in de zin van de artikelen IV en V van dit Verdrag; en  

k. wordt onder „Partij” verstaan een Staat of iedere uit soevereine Staten bestaande regionale organisatie voor economische integratie, die bevoegd is tot het onderhandelen over, het sluiten en het toepassen van internationale overeenkomsten op de gebieden die door dit Verdrag worden bestreken, ten aanzien waarvan dit Verdrag van kracht is.     
2.  De bij dit Verdrag Partij zijnde regionale organisaties voor economische integratie oefenen, wat aangelegenheden die binnen hun bevoegdheid vallen, betreft, zelfstandig de rechten uit en dragen zelfstandig de verantwoordelijkheden die door dit Verdrag aan de Lid-Staten ervan worden toegekend. In deze gevallen zijn de Lid-Staten van deze organisaties niet gerechtigd deze rechten afzonderlijk uit te oefenen.   
3.  Wanneer in dit Verdrag wordt bepaald dat een besluit wordt genomen met een meerderheid van twee derde of met algemene stemmen van de „aanwezige en stem uitbrengende Partijen”, dan betekent dit „de Partijen die aanwezig zijn en die een positieve of negatieve stem hebben uitgebracht”. Voor het bepalen van de meerderheid wordt bij het tellen van de stemmen van de „aanwezige en stem uitbrengende Partijen” geen rekening gehouden met onthoudingen.   

### Artikel  II  

####Grondbeginselen

1.  De Partijen erkennen dat het van belang is dat trekkende soorten worden behouden en dat de Staten die deel uitmaken van het verspreidingsgebied, telkens wanneer dit mogelijk en wenselijk is, overeenstemming bereiken over de daartoe te nemen maatregelen, waarbij zij bijzondere aandacht dienen te besteden aan die trekkende soorten waarvan de mate en de aard van de bescherming niet-gunstig is en waarbij ieder afzonderlijk of in onderlinge samenwerking de passende en noodzakelijke maatregelen dient te nemen voor het behoud van deze soorten en hun leefgebieden.   
2.  De Partijen erkennen de noodzaak tot het nemen van maatregelen om te voorkomen dat een trekkende soort een bedreigde soort wordt.   
3.  In het bijzonder dienen de Partijen:

### Artikel  III  

####Bedreigde trekkende soorten: Bijlage I

1.  In Bijlage I worden de bedreigde trekkende soorten vermeld.   
2.  Een trekkende soort kan in Bijlage I worden vermeld, mits op grond van betrouwbare gegevens, met inbegrip van de beste wetenschappelijke gegevens die beschikbaar zijn, is vastgesteld dat deze soort wordt bedreigd.   
3.  Een trekkende soort kan van de lijst in Bijlage I worden afgevoerd wanneer de Conferentie der Partijen vaststelt: 

a. dat uit betrouwbare gegevens, met inbegrip van de beste wetenschappelijke gegevens die beschikbaar zijn, blijkt dat deze soort niet langer wordt bedreigd;  

b. dat deze soort niet het gevaar loopt opnieuw te worden bedreigd wanneer deze van de lijst in Bijlage I wordt afgevoerd en dientengevolge niet meer wordt beschermd.     
4.  De Partijen die Staten zijn die deel uitmaken van het verspreidingsgebied van een trekkende soort die in Bijlage I is vermeld, stellen alles in het werk om: 

a. de leefgebieden van deze soort die van belang zijn om het dreigend gevaar van uitsterven af te wenden, te behouden, en, waar dit mogelijk en passend is, in hun oude staat terug te brengen;  

b. de negatieve gevolgen van activiteiten of hindernissen die de trek van bedoelde soort ernstig belemmeren of onmogelijk maken, naar gelang van de situatie te voorkomen, weg te nemen, te compenseren of te verkleinen; en  

c. voor zover dit mogelijk en passend is, die invloeden te voorkomen, te verzachten of in de hand te houden, die deze soort bedreigen of ernstiger kunnen gaan bedreigen, met name door toezicht te houden op het uitzetten van uitheemse soorten of door reeds aanwezige uitheemse soorten strikt in de hand te houden of uit te roeien.     
5.  De Partijen die Staten zijn die deel uitmaken van het verspreidingsgebied van een in Bijlage I vermelde trekkende soort, verbieden het onttrekken van dieren aan de populatie van deze soort. Van dit verbod mag slechts worden afgeweken indien: 

a. het onttrekken voor wetenschappelijke doeleinden geschiedt;  

b. het onttrekken geschiedt met het oogmerk verbetering te brengen in de voortplanting of het voortbestaan van deze soort;  

c. het onttrekken geschiedt om aan de behoeften van hen voor wie deze soort vanouds een gebruikelijk middel van bestaan vertegenwoordigt, te voldoen; of  

d. bijzondere omstandigheden zulks vereisen;   mits deze uitzonderingen, wat de aard ervan betreft, nauwkeurig zijn omschreven en beperkt blijven in ruimte en tijd en geen nadelige gevolgen hebben voor deze soort.   
6.  De Conferentie der Partijen kan de Partijen die Staten zijn die deel uitmaken van het verspreidingsgebied van een trekkende soort die in Bijlage I is vermeld, aanbevelen iedere andere maatregel te nemen die voor het voortbestaan van deze soort bevorderlijk wordt geacht.   
7.  De Partijen doen zo spoedig mogelijk het Secretariaat mededeling van iedere uitzondering, toegestaan krachtens het bepaalde in het vijfde lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  IV  

####Trekkende soorten waarvoor overeenkomsten dienen te worden gesloten: Bijlage II

1.  In Bijlage II worden de trekkende soorten vermeld waarvan de mate en aard van de bescherming niet-gunstig is en waarvoor, in verband met het behoud en het beheer ervan, internationale overeenkomsten moeten worden gesloten, alsmede de trekkende soorten waarvan de mate en de aard van de bescherming aanzienlijk gebaat zouden zijn bij de internationale samenwerking die uit een internationale overeenkomst zou voortvloeien.   
2.  Wanneer de omstandigheden zulks rechtvaardigen, kan een trekkende soort zowel in Bijlage I als in Bijlage II worden vermeld.   
3.  De Partijen die Staten zijn die deel uitmaken van het verspreidingsgebied van de trekkende soorten die in Bijlage II zijn vermeld, stellen, wanneer deze soorten hiermee gebaat zijn, alles in het werk overeenkomsten te sluiten. Zij dienen daarbij aan die soorten waarvan de mate en de aard van de bescherming niet-gunstig zijn, voorrang te verlenen.   
4.  De Partijen worden verzocht maatregelen te nemen ten einde overeenkomsten te sluiten voor een gedeelte van de populatie of een geografisch afgezonderd gedeelte van de populatie van een soort of een lager taxon van wilde dieren, waarvan een gedeelte periodiek één of meer landsgrenzen overschrijdt.   
5.  Een afschrift van iedere overeenkomst die is gesloten overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel, wordt aan het Secretariaat toegezonden.

1. De in deze Bijlage opgenomen trekkende soorten worden aangeduid: <sup> 1)  [Red: Zie Appendix II van Trb. 1980, 145.]  </sup> 

a. door de naam van de soort of van de ondersoort; of  

b. door de verzamelnaam van de trekkende soorten die behoren tot een hoger taxon of een aangegeven deel ervan.

2. De afkorting „spp.”, gevolgd door de naam van een familie of een genus dient ter aanduiding van alle trekkende soorten die behoren tot die familie of dat genus.  

3. Andere verwijzing naar taxa die hoger dan de soort zijn, worden uitsluitend ter informatie of classificatie gegeven.  

4. De afkorting „(s.1.)” betekent dat de wetenschappelijke naam in de ruimste betekenis is gebruikt.  

5. Het teken (+), gevolgd door een naast de naam van een soort geplaatst nummer betekent dat alleen geografisch geïsoleerde populaties van dat taxon in deze Bijlage zijn opgenomen, bijvoorbeeld: 

+ 201 Aziatische populaties.    

6. Een sterretje (*) naast de naam van een soort of hoger taxon betekent dat deze soort of een geografisch geïsoleerde populatie van die soort, dan wel een of meer soorten behorende tot dat hoger taxon, in Bijlage I zijn opgenomen.
