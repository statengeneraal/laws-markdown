##Verdrag inzake de erkenning van getuigschriften betreffende hoger onderwijs in de Europese regio

####Convention on the recognition of qualifications concerning higher education in the European region

The Parties to this Convention, Conscious of the fact that the right to education is a human right, and that higher education, which is instrumental in the pursuit and advancement of knowledge, constitutes an exceptionally rich cultural and scientific asset for both individuals and society; Considering that higher education should play a vital role in promoting peace, mutual understanding and tolerance, and in creating mutual confidence among peoples and nations; Considering that the great diversity of education systems in the European region reflects its cultural, social, political, philosophical, religious and economic diversity, an exceptional asset which should be fully respected; Desiring to enable all people of the region to benefit fully from this rich asset of diversity by facilitating access by the inhabitants of each State and by the students of each Party's educational institutions to the educational resources of the other Parties, more specifically by facilitating their efforts to continue their education or to complete a period of studies in higher education institutions in those other Parties; Considering that the recognition of studies, certificates, diplomas and degrees obtained in another country of the European region represents an important measure for promoting academic mobility between the Parties; Attaching great importance to the principle of institutional autonomy, and conscious of the need to uphold and protect this principle; Convinced that a fair recognition of qualifications is a key element of the right to education and a responsibility of society; Having regard to the Council of Europe and UNESCO Conventions covering academic recognition in Europe: European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities (1953, ETS No. 15), and its Protocol (1964, ETS No. 49); European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study (1956, ETS No. 21); European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications (1959, ETS No. 32); Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher Education in the States belonging to the Europe Region (1979); European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study (1990, ETS No. 138); Having regard also to the International Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab and European States bordering on the Mediterranean (1976), adopted within the framework of UNESCO and partially covering academic recognition in Europe; Mindful that this Convention should also be considered in the context of the UNESCO conventions and the International Recommendation covering other Regions of the world, and of the need for an improved exchange of information between these Regions; Conscious of the wide ranging changes in higher education in the European region since these Conventions were adopted, resulting in considerably increased diversification within and between national higher education systems, and of the need to adapt the legal instruments and practice to reflect these developments; Conscious of the need to find common solutions to practical recognition problems in the European region; Conscious of the need to improve current recognition practice and to make it more transparent and better adapted to the current situation of higher education in the European region; Confident of the positive significance of a Convention elaborated and adopted under the joint auspices of the Council of Europe and UNESCO providing a framework for the further development of recognition practices in the European region; Conscious of the importance of providing permanent implementation mechanisms in order to put the principles and provisions of the current Convention into practice,   Have agreed as follows:

####BASIC PRINCIPLES RELATED TO THE ASSESSMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS

### Article  III.1  

1.  Holders of qualifications issued in one of the Parties shall have adequate access, upon request to the appropriate body, to an assessment of these qualifications.   
2.  No discrimination shall be made in this respect on any ground such as the applicant's gender, race, colour, disability, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status, or on the grounds of any other circumstance not related to the merits of the qualification for which recognition is sought. In order to assure this right, each Party undertakes to make appropriate arrangements for the assessment of an application for recognition of qualifications solely on the basis of the knowledge and skills achieved.   

### Article  III.2  

Each Party shall ensure that the procedures and criteria used in the assessment and recognition of qualifications are transparent, coherent and reliable.  

### Article  III.3  

1.  Decisions on recognition shall be made on the basis of appropriate information on the qualifications for which recognition is sought.   
2.  In the first instance, the responsibility for providing adequate information rests with the applicant, who shall provide such information in good faith.   
3.  Notwithstanding the responsibility of the applicant, the institutions having issued the qualifications in question shall have a duty to provide, upon request of the applicant and within reasonable limits, relevant information to the holder of the qualification, to the institution, or to the competent authorities of the country in which recognition is sought.   
4.  The Parties shall instruct or encourage, as appropriate, all education institutions belonging to their education systems to comply with any reasonable request for information for the purpose of assessing qualifications earned at the said institutions.   
5.  The responsibility to demonstrate that an application does not fulfil the relevant requirements lies with the body undertaking the assessment.   

### Article  III.4  

Each Party shall ensure, in order to facilitate the recognition of qualifications, that adequate and clear information on its education system is provided.  

### Article  III.5  

Decisions on recognition shall be made within a reasonable time limit specified beforehand by the competent recognition authority and calculated from the time all necessary information in the case has been provided. If recognition is withheld, the reasons for the refusal to grant recognition shall be stated, and information shall be given concerning possible measures the applicant may take in order to obtain recognition at a later stage. If recognition is withheld, or if no decision is taken, the applicant shall be able to make an appeal within a reasonable time limit.  

### SECTION  IV  

####RECOGNITION OF QUALIFICATIONS GIVING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION

### Article  IV.1  

Each Party shall recognize the qualifications issued by other Parties meeting the general requirements for access to higher education in those Parties for the purpose of access to programmes belonging to its higher education system, unless a substantial difference can be shown between the general requirements for access in the Party in which the qualification was obtained and in the Party in which recognition of the qualification is sought.  

### Article  IV.2  

Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable the holder of a qualification issued in one of the other Parties to obtain an assessment of that qualification, upon request by the holder, and the provisions of Article IV.1 shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to such a case.  

### Article  IV.3  

Where a qualification gives access only to specific types of institutions or programmes of higher education in the Party in which the qualification was obtained, each other Party shall grant holders of such qualifications access to similar specific programmes in institutions belonging to its higher education system, unless a substantial difference can be demonstrated between the requirements for access in the Party in which the qualification was obtained and the Party in which recognition of the qualification is sought.  

### Article  IV.4  

Where admission to particular higher education programmes is dependent on the fulfilment of specific requirements in addition to the general requirements for access, the competent authorities of the Party concerned may impose the additional requirements equally on holders of qualifications obtained in the other Parties or assess whether applicants with qualifications obtained in other Parties fulfil equivalent requirements.  

### Article  IV.5  

Where, in the Party in which they have been obtained, school leaving certificates give access to higher education only in combination with additional qualifying examinations as a prerequisite for access, the other Parties may make access conditional on these requirements or offer an alternative for satisfying such additional requirements within their own educational systems. Any State, the Holy See or the European Community may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify one of the depositaries that it avails itself of the provisions of this Article, specifying the Parties in regard to which it intends to apply this Article as well as the reasons therefor.  

### Article  IV.6  

Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 and IV.5, admission to a given higher education institution, or to a given programme within such an institution, may be restricted or selective. In cases in which admission to a higher education institution and/or programme is selective, admission procedures should be designed with a view to ensuring that the assessment of foreign qualifications is carried out according to the principles of fairness and non-discrimination described in Section III.  

### Article  IV.7  

Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 and IV.5, admission to a given higher education institution may be made conditional on demonstration by the applicant of sufficient competence in the language or languages of instruction of the institution concerned, or in other specified languages.  

### Article  IV.8  

In the Parties in which access to higher education may be obtained on the basis of non-traditional qualifications, similar qualifications obtained in other Parties shall be assessed in a similar manner as non-traditional qualifications earned in the Party in which recognition is sought.  

### Article  IV.9  

For the purpose of admission to programmes of higher education, each Party may make the recognition of qualifications issued by foreign educational institutions operating in its territory contingent upon specific requirements of national legislation or specific agreements concluded with the Party of origin of such institutions.  

### SECTION  V  

####RECOGNITION OF PERIODS OF STUDY

### Article  V.1  

Each Party shall recognize periods of study completed within the framework of a higher education programme in another Party. This recognition shall comprise such periods of study towards the completion of a higher education programme in the Party in which recognition is sought, unless substantial differences can be shown between the periods of study completed in another Party and the part of the higher education programme which they would replace in the Party in which recognition is sought.  

### Article  V.2  

Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable a person who has completed a period of study within the framework of a higher education programme in another Party to obtain an assessment of that period of study, upon request by the person concerned, and the provisions of Article V.1 shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to such a case.  

### Article  V.3  

In particular, each Party shall facilitate recognition of periods of study when: 

a) there has been a previous agreement between, on the one hand, the higher education institution or the competent authority responsible for the relevant period of study and, on the other hand, the higher education institution or the competent recognition authority responsible for the recognition that is sought; and  

b) the higher education institution in which the period of study has been completed has issued a certificate or transcript of academic records attesting that the student has successfully completed the stipulated requirements for the said period of study.    

### SECTION  VI  

####RECOGNITION OF HIGHER EDUCATION QUALIFICATIONS

### Article  VI.1  

To the extent that a recognition decision is based on the knowledge and skills certified by the higher education qualification, each Party shall recognize the higher education qualifications conferred in another Party, unless a substantial difference can be shown between the qualification for which recognition is sought and the corresponding qualification in the Party in which recognition is sought.  

### Article  VI.2  

Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable the holder of a higher education qualification issued in one of the other Parties to obtain an assessment of that qualification, upon request by the holder, and the provisions of Article VI.1 shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to such a case.  

### Article  VI.3  

Recognition in a Party of a higher education qualification issued in another Party shall have one or both of the following consequences: 

a) access to further higher education studies, including relevant examinations, and/or to preparations for the doctorate, on the same conditions as those applicable to holders of qualifications of the Party in which recognition is sought;  

b) the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the Party or a jurisdiction thereof, in which recognition is sought.   In addition, recognition may facilitate access to the labour market subject to laws and regulations of the Party, or a jurisdiction thereof, in which recognition is sought.  

### Article  VI.4  

An assessment in a Party of a higher education qualification issued in another Party may take the form of: 

a) advice for general employment purposes;  

b) advice to an educational institution for the purpose of admission into its programmes;  

c) advice to any other competent recognition authority.    

### Article  VI.5  

Each Party may make the recognition of higher education qualifications issued by foreign educational institutions operating in its territory contingent upon specific requirements of national legislation or specific agreements concluded with the Party of origin of such institutions.

### SECTION  VIII  

####INFORMATION ON THE ASSESSMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMMES

### Article  VIII.1  

Each Party shall provide adequate information on any institution belonging to its higher education system, and on any programme operated by these institutions, with a view to enabling the competent authorities of other Parties to ascertain whether the quality of the qualifications issued by these institutions justifies recognition in the Party in which recognition is sought. Such information shall take the following form: 

a) in the case of Parties having established a system of formal assessment of higher education institutions and programmes: information on the methods and results of this assessment, and of the standards of quality specific to each type of higher education institution granting, and to programmes leading to, higher education qualifications;

De Partijen bij dit Verdrag, Zich bewust van het feit dat het recht op onderwijs één der rechten van de mens is, en dat hoger onderwijs, als zijnde een hulpmiddel bij het streven naar en de bevordering van kennis, zowel voor individuele personen als voor de samenleving een goed van uitzonderlijk rijk cultureel en wetenschappelijk belang is; Overwegende dat hoger onderwijs een essentiële rol dient te spelen bij het bevorderen van vrede, wederzijds begrip en tolerantie, en in het scheppen van wederzijds vertrouwen tussen volken en landen; Overwegende dat de grote verscheidenheid aan onderwijsstelsels in de Europese Regio een afspiegeling vormt van haar culturele, sociale, politieke, levensbeschouwelijke, religieuze en economische verscheidenheid, een goed van buitengewone waarde, dat volledig dient te worden gerespecteerd; Geleid door de wens, alle mensen van de Regio in staat te stellen, volledig te profiteren van deze waardevolle verscheidenheid door de toegang tot de middelen van onderwijs van de andere Partijen te vergemakkelijken voor de inwoners van iedere Staat en voor de studenten van de onderwijsinstellingen van iedere Partij, in het bijzonder door hen in staat te stellen, hun opleiding voort te zetten of een studieperiode te voltooien aan instellingen voor hoger onderwijs op het grondgebied van die andere Partijen; Overwegende dat de erkenning van studies, certificaten, diploma's en graden behaald in een ander land van de Europese Regio, een belangrijke maatregel is ter bevordering van de academische mobiliteit tussen de Partijen; Veel belang hechtend aan het beginsel van autonomie van instellingen, en zich bewust van de noodzaak, dit beginsel te handhaven en te beschermen; Ervan overtuigd dat een billijke erkenning van kwalificaties een wezenlijk onderdeel vormt van het recht op onderwijs en een verantwoordelijkheid is van de samenleving; Gelet op de verdragen van de Raad van Europa en de UNESCO betreffende de academische erkenning in Europa: Europees Verdrag betreffende de gelijkstelling van diploma's voor toelating tot universiteiten (1953, ETS 15), en het bijbehorende Protocol (1964, ETS 49); Europees Verdrag betreffende de gelijkstelling van tijdvakken van universitaire studie (1956, ETS 21); Europees Verdrag inzake de academische erkenning van universitaire kwalificaties (1959, ETS 32); Overeenkomst inzake de erkenning van studies aan, en diploma's of graden van instellingen van hoger onderwijs in de Staten, behorende tot de Europese Regio (1979); Europees Verdrag inzake de algemene gelijkstelling van tijdvakken van universitaire studie (1990, ETS 138); Tevens gelet op het Internationale Verdrag betreffende de erkenning van studies aan, en diploma's en graden van hoger onderwijs in de Arabische en Europese Staten die grenzen aan de Middellandse Zee (1976), dat is aangenomen in het kader van de UNESCO en voor een deel de academische erkenning in Europa bestrijkt; Indachtig het feit dat dit Verdrag ook dient te worden beschouwd in samenhang met de verdragen van de UNESCO en de Internationale Aanbeveling die andere regio's van de wereld bestrijkt, en de noodzaak van een verbeterde uitwisseling van informatie tussen deze regio's; Zich bewust van de omvangrijke veranderingen in het hoger onderwijs in de Europese Regio sinds de aanneming van deze Verdragen, hetgeen heeft geleid tot een aanzienlijke toegenomen diversificatie binnen en tussen nationale stelsels van hoger onderwijs, en van de noodzaak de juridische instrumenten en de juridische praktijk aan te passen, zodat deze in overeenstemming zijn met deze ontwikkelingen; Zich bewust van de noodzaak, gezamenlijke oplossingen te vinden voor praktische problemen inzake de erkenning in de Europese Regio; Zich bewust van de noodzaak, de huidige erkenningspraktijk te verbeteren en deze doorzichtiger te maken en beter afgestemd op de huidige situatie van het hoger onderwijs in de Europese Regio; Overtuigd van de positieve betekenis van een Verdrag dat is opgesteld en aangenomen onder de gezamenlijke auspiciën van de Raad van Europa en de UNESCO, hetgeen een kader verschaft voor de verdere ontwikkeling van de erkenningspraktijken in de Europese Regio; Zich bewust van het belang te zorgen voor permanente uitvoeringsmechanismen, ten einde de beginselen en bepalingen van dit Verdrag in praktijk te brengen,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

####ERKENNING VAN KWALIFICATIES DIE TOEGANG GEVEN TOT HOGER ONDERWIJS

### Artikel  IV.1  

Met het doel toegang te verkrijgen tot programma's welke deel uitmaken van haar stelsel van hoger onderwijs, erkent iedere Partij de door de andere Partijen afgegeven kwalificaties die voldoen aan de algemene eisen betreffende de toegang tot hoger onderwijs op het grondgebied van die Partijen, tenzij een aanzienlijk verschil kan worden aangetoond tussen de algemene eisen betreffende de toegang op het grondgebied van de Partij waar de kwalificatie werd behaald en die op het grondgebied van de Partij waar erkenning van de kwalificatie wordt gevraagd.  

### Artikel  IV.2  

In het andere geval is het voldoende als een Partij de bezitter van een kwalificatie dat werd verleend op het grondgebied van één der andere Partijen, op verzoek van de bezitter in staat stelt een beoordeling van die kwalificatie te verkrijgen; in dit geval is *mutatis mutandis* het bepaalde in artikel IV.1 van toepassing.  

### Artikel  IV.3  

Wanneer een kwalificatie slechts toegang geeft tot specifieke typen instellingen of programma's op het gebied van hoger onderwijs op het grondgebied van de Partij waar de kwalificatie werd behaald, verleent iedere andere Partij aan de bezitters van zodanige kwalificaties toegang tot vergelijkbare specifieke programma's aan instellingen die deel uitmaken van haar stelsel van hoger onderwijs, tenzij een aanzienlijk verschil kan worden aangetoond tussen de toegangseisen op het grondgebied van de Partij waar de kwalificatie werd behaald en die op het grondgebied van de Partij waar erkenning van de kwalificatie wordt gevraagd.  

### Artikel  IV.4  

Wanneer de toelating tot specifieke programma's op het gebied van hoger onderwijs afhankelijk is van de vervulling van specifieke voorwaarden in aanvulling op de algemene toegangseisen, kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Partij de aanvullende eisen op gelijke wijze opleggen aan bezitters van op het grondgebied van de andere Partijen behaalde kwalificaties, of beoordelen of de aanvragers met op het grondgebied van de andere Partijen behaalde kwalificaties voldoen aan gelijkwaardige eisen.  

### Artikel  IV.5  

Wanneer einddiploma's van middelbaar onderwijs die op het grondgebied van de Partij waar zij zijn behaald, slechts in combinatie met aanvullende toelatingsexamens toegang geven tot hoger onderwijs, kunnen de andere Partijen de toegang afhankelijk maken van deze eisen of een alternatief aanbieden ten einde binnen hun eigen onderwijsstelsel te voldoen aan deze aanvullende eisen. Ten tijde van de ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van zijn of haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding, of op enig tijdstip daarna, kan iedere Staat, Vaticaanstad of de Europese Gemeenschap één der depositarissen ervan in kennis stellen dat hij of zij gebruik maakt van de bepalingen van dit artikel, waarbij hij of zij aangeeft ten opzichte van welke Partijen hij of zij voornemens is dit artikel toe te passen, alsmede de redenen hiervoor.  

### Artikel  IV.6  

Onverminderd het bepaalde in de artikelen IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 en IV.5 kan toelating tot een bepaalde instelling voor hoger onderwijs of tot een gegeven programma binnen een zodanige instelling beperkt of selectief zijn. In de gevallen waarin toelating tot een instelling en/of programma op het gebied van hoger onderwijs selectief is, zouden toelatingsprocedures dienen te worden opgesteld met de bedoeling ervoor te zorgen dat buitenlandse kwalificaties worden beoordeeld volgens de beginselen van billijkheid en non-discriminatie, beschreven in hoofdstuk III.  

### Artikel  IV.7  

Onverminderd het bepaalde in de artikelen IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 en IV.5 kan toelating tot een bepaalde instelling op het gebied van hoger onderwijs afhankelijk worden gesteld van een door de aanvrager af te leggen proeve van voldoende kennis van de voor het onderwijs aan de betrokken instelling gebruikte voertaal of voertalen, of in andere aangegeven talen.  

### Artikel  IV.8  

Op het grondgebied van Partijen waar toegang tot hoger onderwijs kan worden verkregen op grond van niet-traditionele kwalificaties, worden vergelijkbare kwalificaties die zijn behaald op het grondgebied van andere Partijen op dezelfde wijze beoordeeld als niet-traditionele kwalificaties die zijn behaald op het grondgebied van de Partij waar erkenning wordt gevraagd.  

### Artikel  IV.9  

Ten behoeve van toelating tot programma's op het gebied van hoger onderwijs kan iedere Partij de erkenning van kwalificaties afgegeven door buitenlandse onderwijsinstellingen die op haar grondgebied werkzaam zijn, afhankelijk stellen van specifieke eisen van de nationale wetgeving of van specifieke overeenkomsten die zijn aangegaan met de Partij van herkomst van deze instellingen.

### Artikel  V.2  

In het andere geval is het voldoende als een Partij een persoon die in het kader van een programma op het gebied van hoger onderwijs een studieperiode op het grondgebied van een andere Partij heeft voltooid, op verzoek van betrokkene in staat stelt, een beoordeling te verkrijgen van die studieperiode; in dit geval is *mutatis mutandis* het bepaalde in artikel V.1 van toepassing.  

### Artikel  V.3  

In het bijzonder geldt dat iedere Partij de erkenning van tijdvakken van studie vergemakkelijkt wanneer: 

a. er vooraf overeenstemming is bereikt tussen, enerzijds, de instelling voor hoger onderwijs of de bevoegde autoriteit die verantwoordelijk is voor de desbetreffende studieperiode en, anderzijds, de instelling voor hoger onderwijs of de bevoegde erkenningsautoriteit die verantwoordelijk is voor de gevraagde erkenning; en  

b. de instelling voor hoger onderwijs aan welke de studieperiode is voltooid, een certificaat of afschrift van de studieresultaten heeft afgegeven, waaruit blijkt dat de student heeft voldaan aan de voor de desbetreffende studieperiode gestelde eisen.
