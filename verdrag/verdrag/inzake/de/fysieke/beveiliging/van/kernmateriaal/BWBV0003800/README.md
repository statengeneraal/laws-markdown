b. diefstal of afpersing van kernmateriaal;  

c. het verduisteren of het zich op enige andere wijze bedrieglijk toeëigenen van kernmateriaal;  

d. het trachten te bemachtigen van kernmateriaal door middel van geweld of bedreiging met geweld of van enige andere vorm van intimidatie;  

e. het uiten van de bedreiging: 

i. kernmateriaal te gebruiken ten einde anderen te doden of ernstig lichamelijk letsel toe te brengen, dan wel aanzienlijke schade aan goederen te veroorzaken;  

ii. een van de strafbare feiten genoemd onder b te plegen, ten einde een natuurlijke persoon of een rechtspersoon, een internationale organisatie of een staat te dwingen iets te doen of na te laten;    

f. de poging tot het plegen van een van de strafbare feiten genoemd onder a, b of c; alsmede  

g. het deelnemen aan een van de strafbare feiten genoemd onder a tot en met f wordt door iedere Verdragsluitende Staat in zijn nationale wetgeving strafbaar gesteld.     
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat verbindt zich er toe op de in dit artikel genoemde strafbare feiten straffen te stellen die beantwoorden aan de ernst van deze feiten.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn bevoegdheid vast te leggen tot kennisneming van de in artikel 7 bedoelde strafbare feiten in de volgende gevallen: 

a. wanneer het strafbare feit wordt gepleegd op het grondgebied van deze Staat of aan boord van een vaartuig of luchtvaartuig dat in deze Staat is geregistreerd;  

b. wanneer de vermoedelijke dader een onderdaan van deze Staat is.     
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat neemt tevens de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn bevoegdheid tot kennisneming van deze strafbare feiten vast te leggen in gevallen waarin de vermoedelijke dader zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt en de Staat hem niet overeenkomstig artikel 11 uitlevert aan een van de in het eerste lid bedoelde Staten.   
3.  Dit Verdrag sluit geen enkele bevoegdheid in strafzaken uit, die wordt uitgeoefend krachtens de nationale wet.   
4.  Behalve de in het eerste en tweede lid bedoelde Staten, kunnen ook alle andere Verdragsluitende Staten die bij internationaal vervoer van kernmateriaal betrokken zijn als uitvoerende of invoerende Staat, bevoegdheid tot kennisneming van de in artikel 7 genoemde strafbare feiten vastleggen, overeenkomstig het internationale recht.   

### Artikel  9  

Een Verdragsluitende Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, neemt, indien hij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden zulks wettigen, overeenkomstig zijn nationale wetgeving passende maatregelen, vrijheidsbeneming inbegrepen, ter verzekering van diens aanwezigheid met het oog op strafvervolging of uitlevering. De maatregelen die op grond van dit artikel worden genomen, worden onverwijld meegedeeld aan de Staten die overeenkomstig artikel 8 hun bevoegdheid dienen vast te leggen, en zo nodig aan alle andere betrokken Staten.  

### Artikel  10  

De Verdragsluitende Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader wordt aangetroffen is, indien hij hem niet uitlevert, verplicht de zaak, zonder enige uitzondering en zonder onnodig uitstel, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van deze Staat voor vervolging aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten over te dragen.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  De in artikel 7 genoemde strafbare feiten worden geacht in elk tussen de Verdragsluitende Staten bestaand uitleveringsverdrag te zijn begrepen als uitleveringsdelicten. De Verdragsluitende Staten verplichten zich ertoe deze strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat welke uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat waarmee hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan hij, indien hij dat verkiest, dit Verdrag beschouwen als wettelijke basis voor uitlevering ter zake van de vorengenoemde strafbare feiten. De uitlevering is onderworpen aan de overige voorwaarden, waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Staten die de uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de vorengenoemde strafbare feiten onderling als uitleveringsdelicten, waarin het recht onderworpen aan de voorwaarden van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
4.  Voor uitlevering tussen Verdragsluitende Staten wordt elk van deze strafbare feiten beschouwd als niet alleen begaan op de plaats waar het is gepleegd, maar ook op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Staten die overeenkomstig het eerste lid van artikel 8 hun bevoegdheid dienen vast te leggen.   

### Artikel  12  

Een ieder tegen wie een strafvervolging wordt ingesteld op grond van een van de in artikel 7 genoemde strafbare feiten, geniet een eerlijke behandeling in elk stadium van de gerechtelijke procedure.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten verlenen wederzijds de ruimst mogelijke rechtshulp in strafzaken wegens de in artikel 7 genoemde strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van de verschaffing van bewijsstukken waarover zij beschikken en die noodzakelijk zijn voor strafvervolging. In alle gevallen is op de uitvoering van een verzoek om rechtshulp de wet van de aangezochte staat van toepassing.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het eerste lid laat verplichtingen uit hoofde van een ander bilateraal of multilateraal Verdrag dat geheel of gedeeltelijk de rechtshulp in strafzaken regelt of zal regelen, onverlet.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat stelt de Depositaris op de hoogte van de wetten en voorschriften uitgevaardigd ter uitvoering van dit Verdrag. De Depositaris brengt deze inlichtingen op geregelde tijdstippen ter kennis van alle Verdragsluitende Staten.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader wordt vervolgd, deelt, voor zover zulks uitvoerbaar is, de definitieve gerechtelijke uitspraak in de eerste plaats mee aan de rechtstreeks betrokken Staten. De Verdragsluitende Staat deelt tevens deze uitspraak mee aan de Depositaris, die daarvan kennis geeft aan alle Staten.   
3.  In gevallen waarin een strafbaar feit betrekking heeft op het gebruik, de opslag of het vervoer op het nationale grondgebied van kernmateriaal, gebruikt voor vreedzame doeleinden, waarbij zowel de vermoedelijke dader als het kernmateriaal zich bevinden op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Staat waar het strafbare feit is gepleegd, mag niets in dit Verdrag worden uitgelegd als een verplichting van deze Verdragsluitende Staat om inlichtingen te verstrekken omtrent de strafrechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot dit strafbare feit.   

### Artikel  15  

De Bijlagen bij dit Verdrag vormen een wezenlijk bestanddeel van het Verdrag.  

### Artikel  16  

1.  Vijf jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag roept de Depositaris een conferentie van de Verdragsluitende Staten bijeen ten einde de toepassing van het Verdrag te onderzoeken, alsmede de toereikendheid daarvan ten aanzien van de preambule, het geheel van de bepalingen en de Bijlagen in het licht van de situatie op dat tijdstip.   
2.  Vervolgens kan de meerderheid van de Verdragsluitende Staten, met tussenpozen van tenminste vijf jaar, conferenties voor hetzelfde doel bijeenroepen door daartoe bij de Depositaris een voorstel in te dienen.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  In geval van een geschil tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag, plegen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staten onderling overleg om het geschil bij te leggen door onderhandeling of door enig ander vreedzaam middel tot regeling van geschillen, dat voor alle partijen bij het geschil aanvaardbaar is.   
2.  Elk zodanig geschil dat niet kan worden geregeld op de in het eerste lid voorgeschreven wijze, wordt op verzoek van een partij bij dit geschil onderworpen aan arbitrage of voor beslechting verwezen naar het Internationale Gerechtshof. Indien de partijen bij het geschil binnen zes maanden na de dagtekening van het verzoek om arbitrage geen overeenstemming hebben bereikt over de wijze van arbitrage, kan een partij de Voorzitter van het Internationale Gerechtshof of de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties verzoeken een of meer scheidsmannen te benoemen. Ingeval de verzoeken van de partijen bij het geschil niet overeenstemmen, heeft het verzoek aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voorrang.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat kan, op het tijdstip dat hij dit Verdrag ondertekent, bekrachtigt, aanvaardt, goedkeurt of ertoe toetreedt, verklaren dat hij zich niet gebonden acht door een van beide of door beide procedures tot regeling van geschillen, bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel. De andere Verdragsluitende Staten zijn door een in het tweede lid genoemde procedure tot regeling van geschillen niet gebonden met betrekking tot een Verdragsluitende Staat die een voorbehoud ten aanzien van deze procedure heeft gemaakt.   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel, kan te allen tijde zijn voorbehoud intrekken door middel van een kennisgeving aan de Depositaris.

### BIJLAGE  I  

####Toe te passen niveaus van fysieke beveiliging bij het internationaal vervoer van het in Bijlage II geclassificeerde kernmateriaal.

1. Niveaus van fysieke beveiliging van kernmateriaal bij voorlopige opslag gedurende internationaal vervoer van kernmateriaal: 

a. voor materiaal uit categorie III: opslag op een terrein waarvan de toegang onder toezicht staat;  

b. voor materiaal uit categorie II: opslag op een terrein dat voortdurend wordt gecontroleerd door bewakers of elektronische apparatuur en omgeven is door een afscheiding met een beperkt aantal toegangen onder passend toezicht, of op enig terrein met een overeenkomstige fysieke beveiliging;  

c. voor materiaal uit categorie I: opslag op een beveiligd terrein zoals hierboven is omschreven voor categorie II, waarbij bovendien de toegang beperkt is tot personen wier betrouwbaarheid is vastgesteld, en dat onder toezicht staat van bewakers die nauw contact onderhouden met de autoriteiten die bevoegd zijn handelend op te treden. De in dit verband getroffen bijzondere maatregelen dienen gericht te zijn op de ontdekking en de voorkoming van het zich gewelddadig, dan wel onbevoegd toegang verschaffen tot of het onrechtmatig wegnemen van kernmateriaal.    

2. Niveaus van fysieke beveiliging van kernmateriaal tijdens internationaal vervoer: 

a. voor materiaal uit categorie II en III: het vervoer dient plaats te vinden met inachtneming van bijzondere voorzorgsmaatregelen, met inbegrip van voorafgaande overeenkomsten tussen afzender, ontvanger en vervoerder, alsmede een voorafgaande overeenkomst tussen natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen, onderworpen aan de rechtsmacht en de voorschriften van de uitvoerende en de invoerende Staten, met vermelding van tijd, plaats en procedures voor de overdracht van de verantwoordelijkheid voor het vervoer;  

b. voor materiaal uit categorie I: het vervoer dient plaats te vinden met inachtneming van de bijzondere voorzorgsmaatregelen zoals hierboven zijn vastgesteld voor het vervoer van materiaal uit categorie II en III, met daarbij voortdurend toezicht door begeleiders en onder omstandigheden die nauw contact waarborgen met de autoriteiten die bevoegd zijn handelend op te treden;  

c. voor natuurlijke uranium anders dan in de vorm van erts of ertsresidu dient als beveiligingsmaatregel bij het vervoer van hoeveelheden van meer dan 500 kg uranium vooraf kennis van de verzending te worden gegeven, met vermelding van de wijze van vervoer en de vermoedelijke tijd van aankomst, terwijl later de ontvangst van de zending dient te worden bevestigd.
