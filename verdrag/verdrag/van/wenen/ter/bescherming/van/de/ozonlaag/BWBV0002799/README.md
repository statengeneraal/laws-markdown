### 4  

The following chemical substances of natural and anthropogenic origin, not listed in order of priority, are thought to have the potential to modify the chemical and physical properties of the ozone layer. 

(a)  *Carbon substances*  

(i)  *Carbon monoxide (CO)*  Carbon monoxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and is thought to play a major direct role in tropospheric photochemistry, and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.  

(ii)  *Carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>)*  Carbon dioxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and affects stratospheric ozone by influencing the thermal structure of the atmosphere.  

(iii)  *Methane (CH <sub>4</sub>)*  Methane has both natural and anthropogenic sources, and affects both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.  

(iv)  *Non-methane hydrocarbon species*  Non-methane hydrocarbon species, which consist of a large number of chemical substances, have both natural and anthropogenic sources, and play a direct role in tropospheric photochemistry and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.    

(b)  *Nitrogen substances*  

(i)  *Nitrous oxide (N <sub>2</sub> O)*  The dominant sources of N <sub>2</sub> O are natural, but anthropogenic contributions are becoming increasingly important. Nitrous oxide is the primary source of stratospheric NO <sub>X</sub>, which play a vital role in controlling the abundance of stratospheric ozone.  

(ii) *Nitrogen oxides* (NO <sub>x</sub>) Ground-level sources of NO <sub>X</sub> play a major direct role only in tropospheric photochemical processes and an indirect role in stratosphere photochemistry, whereas injection of NO <sub>X</sub> close to the tropopause may lead directly to a change in upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.    

(c)  *Chlorine substances*  

(i) *Fully halogenated alkanes,* e.g. CCI <sub>4</sub>, CFC1 <sub>3</sub>, (CFC-11), CF <sub>2</sub> CI <sub>2</sub>, (CFC-12), C <sub>2</sub> F <sub>3</sub> CI <sub>3</sub> (CFC-113), C <sub>2</sub> F <sub>4</sub> CI <sub>2</sub> (CFC-114) Fully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of C10 <sub>x</sub>, which plays a vital role in ozone photochemistry, especially in the 30-50 km altitude region.  

(ii) *Partially halogenated alkanes,* e.g. CH <sub>3</sub> CI, CHF <sub>2</sub> CI (CFC-22), CH <sub>3</sub> CCI <sub>3</sub>, CHFCI <sub>2</sub> (CFC-21) The sources of CH <sub>3</sub> CI are natural, whereas the other partially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are anthropogenic in origin. These gases also act as a source of stratospheric C1O <sub>X</sub>.    

(d)  *Bromine substances*   *Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF <sub>3</sub> Br*  These gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of BrO <sub>x</sub>, which behaves in a manner similar to CIO <sub>X</sub>.  

(e)  *Hydrogen substances*  

(i)  *Hydrogen (H <sub>2</sub>)*  Hydrogen, the source of which is natural and anthropogenic, plays a minor role in stratospheric photochemistry.  

(ii)  *Water (H <sub>2</sub> O)*  Water, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in both tropospheric and stratospheric photochemistry. Local sources of water vapour in the stratosphere include the oxidation of methane and, to a lesser extent, of hydrogen.

####Resolution on a Protocol Concerning Chlorofluorocarbons

The Conference, Noting with appreciation that the Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was opened for signature in Vienna on 22 March 1985, Bearing in mind decision 8/7B adopted on 29 April 1980 by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Considering that the Convention is an important step to protect the ozone layer from modifications due to human activities, Noting that article 2 of the Convention establishes an obligation to take appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer, Recognizing the possibility that world-wide emissions and use of fully-halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chlorine-containing substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer, leading to potentially adverse effects on human health, crops, marine life, materials and climate, and *recognizing* at the same time the need to further assess possible modifications and their potentially adverse effects, Mindful of the precautionary measures for controlling emissions and use of CFCs that have already been taken at national and regional levels, but recognizing that such measures might not be sufficient for protecting the ozone layer, Determined therefore to continue negotiations on the development of a protocol to control equitably global production, emissions and use of CFCs, Mindful that special consideration should be given to the particular situation of developing countries, Mindful also of the relationship between the level of industrialization of a State and its responsibilities for the protection of the ozone layer, Noting the considerable progress made by the *Ad Hoc* Working Group of Legal and Technical Experts for the Elaboration of a Global Framework Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer to develop a protocol concerning CFCs, but further noting that the Working Group was not in a position to complete its work on the protocol, 

1. Pending the entry into force of the Convention, *requests* the Executive Director of UNEP, on the basis of the work of the *Ad Hoc* Working Group, to convene a working group to continue work on a protocol that addresses both short and long term strategies to control equitably global production emissions and use CFCs, taking into account the particular situation of developing countries as well as updated scientific and economic research;  

2. Urges all interested parties, in order to facilitate work on a protocol, to co-operate in studies leading to a more common understanding of possible scenarios for global production, emissions and use of CFCs and other substances affecting the ozone layer and the costs and effects of various control measures and, to this end, requests such parties to sponsor, under the patronage of UNEP, a workshop on this subject;  

3. Requests the working group, in further developing a protocol, to take into account, *inter alia,* the report of the Co-ordinating Committee on the Ozone Layer on its eighth session as well as the 1985 World Meteorological Organization assessment of the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes which control atmospheric ozone;  

4. Authorizes the Executive Director, in consultation with the signatories and pending the entry into force of the Convention, to convene a Diplomatic Conference, if possible in 1987, for the purpose of adopting such a protocol;  

5. Appeals to signatories to the Convention and to other interested parties participating in the preparation of a protocol to make available financial means to support activities envisaged under the above paragraphs;  

6. Urges all States and regional economic integration organizations, pending entry into force of a protocol, to control their emissions of CFCs, *inter alia* in aerosols, by any means at their disposal, including controls on production or use, to the maximum extent practicable.

Rekening houdend met de bijzondere behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden, werken de Partijen bij dit Verdrag samen bij het bevorderen van een passende wetenschappelijke en technische opleiding die nodig is om aan de uitvoering van het wetenschappelijk onderzoek en de systematische waarnemingen, zoals in deze Bijlage zijn beschreven, deel te nemen. Er dient in het bijzonder aandacht te worden besteed aan de vergelijkende ijking van de instrumenten en de waarnemingsmethoden ten behoeve van de verkrijging van vergelijkbare en gestandaardiseerde wetenschappelijke gegevensverzamelingen.  

### 4  

Van de volgende chemische stoffen van natuurlijke en antropogene oorsprong, die niet in volgorde van belangrijkheid zijn vermeld, wordt aangenomen dat zij het vermogen bezitten de chemische en fysische eigenschappen van de ozonlaag kunnen wijzigen. 

a)  *Koolstofverbindingen*  

(i)  *Koolstofmonoxide (CO)*  Koolstofmonoxide heeft belangrijke natuurlijke en antropogene bronnen en speelt vermoedelijk rechtstreeks een belangrijke rol in de fotochemische processen in de troposfeer en speelt indirect een rol in de fotochemische processen in de stratosfeer.  

(ii)  *Koolstofdioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>)*  Koolstofdioxide heeft belangrijke natuurlijke en antropogene bronnen en beïnvloedt het ozon in de stratosfeer doordat het de thermische structuur van de atmosfeer beïnvloedt.  

(iii)  *Methaan (CH <sub>4)</sub>*  Methaan is zowel van natuurlijke als antropogene oorsprong en beïnvloedt het ozon in de troposfeer en de stratosfeer.  

(iv)  *Andere koolwaterstoffen dan methaan*  Deze koolwaterstoffen, die een groot aantal chemische stoffen omvatten, zijn zowel van natuurlijke als antropogene oorsprong en spelen rechtstreeks een rol in de fotochemische processen in de troposfeer en indirect in de fotochemische processen in de stratosfeer.    

b)  *Stikstofverbindingen*  

(i)  *Distikstofoxide (N <sub>2</sub> O)*  Het N <sub>2</sub> O is voornamelijk van natuurlijke oorsprong, maar de antropogene emissies worden steeds belangrijker. Distikstofoxide is de voornaamste bron van het NO <sub>X</sub> in de stratosfeer, dat een zeer belangrijke rol speelt bij de beperking van het ozongehalte van de stratosfeer.  

(ii)  *Stikstofoxiden (NO <sub>x</sub>)*  De NO <sub>x</sub> -bronnen op grondniveau spelen rechtstreeks slechts een belangrijke rol in de fotochemische processen in de troposfeer en spelen indirect een rol in de fotochemische processen in de stratosfeer, terwijl de emissie van NO <sub>X</sub> dicht bij de tropopauze rechtstreeks kan leiden tot wijziging van het ozongehalte in de bovenste lagen van de troposfeer en in de stratosfeer.    

c)  *Chloorverbindingen*  

(i) *Volledige gehalogeneerde alkanen,* b.v. CC1 <sub>4</sub>, CFC1 <sub>3</sub> (CFK-11), CF <sub>2</sub> CI <sub>2</sub> (CFK-12), C <sub>2</sub> F <sub>3</sub> CI <sub>3</sub> (CFK-113), C <sub>2</sub> F <sub>4</sub> Cl <sub>2</sub> (CFK-114) Volledig gehalogeneerde alkanen zijn van antropogene oorsprong en fungeren als bron van C10 <sub>x</sub>, dat een zeer belangrijke rol speelt in de fotochemische processen in de ozonlaag, in het bijzonder in het gebied op een hoogte tussen 30 en 50 km.  

(ii) *Gedeeltelijk gehalogeneerde alkanen,* b.v. CH <sub>3</sub> C1, CHF <sub>2</sub> C1 (CFK-22), CH <sub>3</sub> CCI <sub>3</sub>, CHFCI <sub>2</sub> (CFK-21) Het CH <sub>3</sub> CI is van natuurlijke oorsprong, terwijl de overige gedeeltelijk gehalogeneerde alkanen die hierboven genoemd zijn, van antropogene oorsprong zijn. Deze gassen fungeren tevens als bron van C10 <sub>x</sub> in de stratosfeer.    

d)  *Broomverbindingen*   *Volledig gehalogeneerde alkanen, b.v. CF <sub>3</sub> Br*  Deze gassen zijn van antropogene oorsprong en fungeren als bron van BRO <sub>X</sub>, dat zich op dezelfde wijze als C10 <sub>x</sub> gedraagt.  

e)  *Waterstofverbindingen*  

(i)  *Waterstof (H <sub>2</sub>)*  Waterstof is van natuurlijke en antropogene oorsprong en speelt een onbetekenende rol in de fotochemische processen in de stratosfeer.  

(ii)  *Water (H <sub>2</sub> O)*  Water, dat van natuurlijke oorsprong is, speelt een essentiële rol in de fotochemische processen in zowel de troposfeer als de stratosfeer. Stratosferische bronnen van waterdamp worden onder andere gevormd door de oxidatie van methaan en, in mindere maten, van waterstof.
