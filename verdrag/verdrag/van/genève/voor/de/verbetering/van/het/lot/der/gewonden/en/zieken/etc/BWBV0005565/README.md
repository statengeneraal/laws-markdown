####GENEVA CONVENTION FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE WOUNDED AND SICK IN ARMED FORCES IN THE FIELD OF AUGUST 12, 1949

The undersigned Plenipotentiaries of the Governments represented at the Diplomatic Conference held at Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949, for the purpose of revising the Geneva Convention for the Relief of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field of July 27, 1929, have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  1  

The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.  

### Article  2  

In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  

### Article  3  

In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occuring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: 

(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed *hors de combat* by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanity, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: 

(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;  

(b) taking of hostages;  

(c) outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;  

(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.    

(2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.   An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  4  

Neutral Powers shall apply by analogy the provisions of the present Convention to the wounded and sick, and to members of the medical personnel and to chaplains of the armed forces of the Parties to the conflict, received or interned in their territory, as well as to dead persons found.  

### Article  5  

For the protected persons who have fallen into the hands of the enemy, the present Convention shall apply until their final repatriation.  

### Article  6  

In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 10, 15, 23, 28, 31, 36, 37 and 52, the High Contracting Parties may conclude other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of the wounded and sick, of members of the medical personnel or of chaplains, as defined by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them. Wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and chaplains, shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as long as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions to the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one or other of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  7  

Wounded and sick, as well as members of the medical personnel and chaplains, may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.  

### Article  8  

The present Convention shall be applied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties. The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible, the task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers. The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular, take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they carry out their duties. Their activities shall only be restricted as an exceptional and temporary measure when this is rendered necessary by imperative military necessities.  

### Article  9  

The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of wounded and sick, medical personnel and chaplains, and for their relief.  

### Article  10  

The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention. When wounded and sick, or medical personnel and chaplains do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict. If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by Protecting Powers under the present Convention. Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and to discharge them impartially. No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied. Whenever, in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power, such mention also applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present Article.  

### Article  11  

In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons, particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement. For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible for the wounded and sick, members of medical personnel and chaplains, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part in such a meeting.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####WOUNDED AND SICK

### Article  12  

Members of the armed forces and other persons mentioned in the following Article, who are wounded or sick, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments; they shall not wilfully be left without medical assistance and care, nor shall conditions exposing them to contagion or infection be created. Only urgent medical reasons will authorize priority in the order of treatment to be administered. Women shall be treated with all consideration due to their sex. The Party to the conflict which is compelled to abandon wounded or sick to the enemy shall, as far as military considerations permit, leave with them a part of its medical personnel and material to assist in their care.  

### Article  13  

The present Convention shall apply to the wounded and sick belonging to the following categories. 

(1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict, as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.  

(2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions: 

(a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;  

(b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;  

(c) that of carrying arms openly;

(3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a Government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.  

(4) Persons who accompany the armed forces witnout actually being members thereof, such as civil members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany.  

(5) Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.  

(6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.    

### Article  14  

Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the wounded and sick of a belligerent who fall into enemy hands shall be prisoners of war, and the provisions of international law concerning prisoners of war shall apply to them.  

### Article  15  

At all times, and particularly after an engagement, Parties to the conflict shall, without delay, take all possible measures to search for and collect the wounded and sick, to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment, to ensure their adequate care, and to search for the dead and prevent their being despoiled. Whenever circumstances permit, an armistice, or a suspension of fire shall be arranged, or local arrangements made, to permit the removal, exchange and transport of the wounded left on the battlefield. Likewise, local arrangements may be concluded between Parties to the conflict for the removal or exchange of wounded and sick from a besieged or encircled area, and for the passage of medical and religious personnel and equipment on their way to that area.  

### Article  16  

Parties to the conflict shall record as soon as possible, in respect of each wounded, sick or dead person of the adverse Party falling into their hands, any particulars which may assist in his identification. These records should if possible include: 

(a) designation of the Power on which he depends;  

(b) army, regimental, personal or serial number;  

(c) surname;  

(d) first name or names;  

(e) date of birth;  

(f) any other particulars shown on his indentity card or disc;  

(g) date and place of capture or death;  

(h) particulars concerning wounds or illness, or cause of death.   As soon as possible the above mentioned information shall be forwarded to the Information Bureau described in Article 122 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, which shall transmit this information to the Power on which these persons depend through the intermediary of the Protecting Power and of the Central Prisoners of War Agency. Parties to the conflict shall prepare and forward to each other through the same bureau, certificates of death or duly authenticated lists of the dead. They shall likewise collect and forward through the same bureau one half of a double identity disc, last wills or other documents of importance to the next of kin, money and in general all articles of an intrinsic or sentimental value, which are found on the dead. These articles, together with unidentified articles, shall be sent in sealed packets, accompanied by statements giving all particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased owners, as wel as by a complete list of the contents of the parcel.  

### Article  17  

Parties to the conflict shall ensure that burial or cremation of the dead, carried out individually as far as circumstances permit, is preceded by a careful examination, if possible by a medical examination, of the bodies, with a view to confirming death, establishing identity and enabling a report to be made. One half of the double identity disc, or the identity disc itself if it is a single disc, should remain on the body. Bodies shall not be cremated except for imperative reasons of hygiene or for motives based on the religion of the deceased. In case of cremation, the circumstances and reasons for cremation shall be stated in detail in the death certificate or on the authenticated list of the dead They shall further ensure that the dead are honourably interred, if possible according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged, that their graves are respected, grouped if possible according to the nationality of the deceased, properly maintained and marked so that they may always be found. For this purpose, they shall organize at the commencement of hostilities an Official Graves Registration Service, to allow subsequent exhumations and to ensure the identification of bodies, whatever the site of the graves, and the possible transportation to the home country. These provisions shall likewise apply to the ashes, which shall be kept by the Graves Registration Service until proper disposal thereof in accordance with the wishes of the home country. As soon as circumstance permit, and at latest at the end of hostilities, these Services shall exchange, through the Information Bureau mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 16, lists showing the exact location and markings of the graves, together with particulars of the dead interred therein.  

### Article  18  

The military authorities may appeal to the charity of the inhabitants voluntarily to collect and care for, under their direction, the wounded and sick, granting persons who have responded to this appeal the necessary protection and facilities. Should the adverse Party take or retake control of the area, he shall likewise grant these persons the same protection and the same facilities. The military authorities shall permit the inhabitants and relief societies, even in invaded or occupied areas, spontaneously to collect and care for wounded or sick of whatever nationality. The civilian population shall respect these wounded and sick, and in particular abstain from offering them violence. No one may ever be molested or convicted for having nursed the wounded or sick. The provisions of the present Article do not relieve the occupying Power of its obligation to give both physical and moral care to the wounded and sick.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####MEDICAL UNITS AND ESTABLISHMENTS

### Article  19  

Fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service may in no circumstances be attacked, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict. Should they fall into the hands of the adverse Party, their personnel shall be free to pursue their duties, as long as the capturing Power has not itself ensured the necessary care of the wounded and sick found in such establishments and units. The responsible authorities shall ensure that the said medical establishments and units are, as far as possible, situated in such a manner that attacks against military objectives cannot imperil their safety.  

### Article  20  

Hospital ships entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, shall not be attacked from the land.  

### Article  21  

The protection to which fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded.  

### Article  22  

The following conditions shall not be considered as depriving a medical unit or establishment of the protection guaranteed by Article 19: 

(1) That the personnel of the unit or establishment are armed, and that they use the arms in their own defence, or in that of the wounded and sick in their charge.  

(2) That in the absence of armed orderlies, the unit or establishment is protected by a picket or by sentries or by an escort.  

(3) That small arms and ammunition taken from the wounded and sick and not yet handed to the proper service, are found in the unit or establishment.  

(4) That personnel and material of the veterinary service are found in the unit or establishment, without forming an integral part thereof.  

(5) That the humanitarian activities of medical units and establishments or of their personnel extend to the care of civilian wounded or sick.    

### Article  23  

In time of peace, the High Contracting Parties and, after the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties thereto, may establish in their own territory and, if the need arises, in occupied areas, hospital zones and localities so organized as to protect the wounded and sick from the effects of war, as well as the personnel entrusted with the organization and administration of these zones and localities and with the care of the persons therein assembled. Upon the outbreak and during the course of hostilities, the Parties concerned may conclude agreements on mutual recognition of the hospital zones and localities they have created. They may for this purpose implement the provisions of the Draft Agreement annexed to the present Convention, with such amendments as they may consider necessary. The Protecting Powers and the International Committee of the Red Cross are invited to lend their good offices in order to facilitate the institution and recognition of these hospital zones and localities  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####PERSONNEL

### Article  24  

Medical personnel exclusively engaged in the search for, or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded or sick, or in the prevention of disease, staff exclusively engaged in the administration of medical units and establishments, as well as chaplains attached to the armed forces, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.  

### Article  25  

Members of the armed forces specially trained for employment, should the need arise, as hospital orderlies, nurses or auxiliary stretcher-bearers, in the search for or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded and sick shall likewise be respected and protected if they are carrying out these duties at the time when they come into contact with the enemy or fall into his hands.  

### Article  26  

The staff of National Red Cross Societies and that of other Voluntary Aid Societies, duly recognized and authorized by their Governments, who may be employed on the same duties as the personnel named in Article 24, are placed on the same footing as the personnel named in the said Article provided that the staff of such societies are subject to military laws and regulations. Each High Contracting Party shall notify to the other, either in time of peace or at the commencement of or during hostilities, but in any case before actually employing them, the names of the societies which it has authorized, under its responsibility, to render assistance to the regular medical service of its armed forces.  

### Article  27  

A recognized Society of a neutral country can only lend the assistance of its medical personnel and units to a Party to the conflict with the previous consent of its own Government and the authorization of the Party to the conflict concerned. That personnel and those units shall be placed under the control of that Party to the conflict. The neutral Government shall notify this consent to the adversary of the State which accepts such assistance. The Party to the conflict who accepts such assistance is bound to notify the adverse Party thereof before making any use of it. In no circumstances shall this assistance be considered as interference in the conflict. The members of the personnel named in the first paragraph shall be duly furnished with the identity cards provided for in Article 40 before leaving the neutral country to which they belong.  

### Article  28  

Personnel designated in Articles 24 and 26 who fall into the hands of the adverse Party, shall be retained only in so far as the state of health, the spiritual needs and the number of prisoners of war require. Personnel thus retained shall not be deemed prisoners of war. Nevertheless they shall at least benefit by all the provision of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. Within the framework of the military laws and regulations of the Detaining Power, and under the authority of its competent service, they shall continue to carry out, in accordance with their professional ethics, their medical and spiritual duties on behalf of prisoners of war, preferably those of the armed forces to which they themselves belong. They shall further enjoy the following facilities for carrying out their medical or spiritual duties: 

(a) They shall be authorized to visit periodically the prisoners of war in labour units or hospitals outside the camp. The Detaining Power shall put at their disposal the means of transport required.  

(b) In each camp the senior medical officer of the highest rank shall be responsible to the military authorities of the camp for the professional activity of the retained medical personnel. For this purpose, from the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties to the conflict shall agree regarding the corresponding seniority of the ranks of their medical personnel, including those of the societies designated in Article 26. In all questions arising out of their duties, this medical officer, and the chaplains, shall have direct access to the military and medical authorities of the camp who shall grant them the facilities they may require for correspondence relating to these questions.  

(c) Although retained personnel in a camp shall be subject to its internal discipline, they shall not, however, be required to perform any work outside their medical or religious duties.   During hostilities the Parties to the conflict shall make arrangements for relieving where possible retained personnel, and shall settle the procedure of such relief. None of the preceding provisions shall relieve the Detaining Power of the obligations imposed upon it with regard to the medical and spiritual welfare of the prisoners of war.  

### Article  29  

Members of the personnel designated in Article 25 who have fallen into the hands of the enemy, shall be prisoners of war, but shall be employed on their medical duties in so far as the need arises.  

### Article  30  

Personnel whose retention is not indispensable by virtue of the provisions of Article 28 shall be returned to the Party to the conflict to whom they belong, as soon as a road is open for their return and military requirements permit. Pending their return, they shall not be deemed prisoners of war. Nevertheless they shall at least benefit by all the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. They shall continue to fulfil their duties under the orders of the adverse Party and shall preferably be engaged in the care of the wounded and sick of the Party to the conflict to which they themselves belong. On their departure, they shall take with them the effects, personal belongings, valuables and instruments belonging to them.  

### Article  31  

The selection of personnel for return under Article 30 shall be made irrespective of any consideration of race, religion or political opinion, but preferably according to the chronological order of their capture and their state of health. As from the outbreak of hostilities, Parties to the conflict may determine by special agreement the percentage of personnel to be retained, in proportion to the number of prisoners and the distribution of the said personnel in the camps.  

### Article  32  

Persons designated in Article 27 who have fallen into the hands of the adverse Party may not be detained. Unless otherwise agreed, they shall have permission to return to their country, or if this is not possible, to the territory of the Party to the conflict in whose service they were, as soon as a route for their return is open and military considerations permit. Pending their release, they shall continue their work under the direction of the adverse Party; they shall preferably be engaged in the care of the wounded and sick of the Party to the conflict in whose service they were. On their departure, they shall take with them their effects, personal articles and valuables and the instruments, arms and if possible the means of transport belonging to them. The Parties to the conflict shall secure to this personnel, while in their power, the same food, lodging, allowances and pay as are granted to the corresponding personnel of their armed forces. The food shall in any case be sufficient as regards quantity, quality and variety to keep the said personnel in a normal state of health.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####BUILDINGS AND MATERIAL

### Article  33  

The material of mobile medical units of the armed forces which fall into the hands of the enemy, shall be reserved for the care of wounded and sick. The buildings, material and stores of fixed medical establishments of the armed forces shall remain subject to the laws of war, but may not be diverted from that purpose as long as they are required for the care of wounded and sick. Nevertheless, the commanders of forces in the field may make use of them, in case of urgent military necessity, provided that they make previous arrangements for the welfare of the wounded and sick who are nursed in them. The material and stores defined in the present Article shall not be intentionally destroyed.  

### Article  34  

The real and personal property of aid societies which are admitted to the privileges of the Convention shall be regarded as private property. The right of requisition recognized for belligerents by the laws and customs of war shall not be exercised except in case of urgent necessity, and only after the welfare of the wounded and sick has been ensured.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####MEDICAL TRANSPORTS

### Article  35  

Transports of wounded and sick or of medical equipment shall be respected and protected in the same way as mobile medical units. Should such transports or vehicles fall into the hands of the adverse Party, they shall be subject to the laws of war, on condition that the Party to the conflict who captures them shall in all cases ensure the care of the wounded and sick they contain. The civilian personnel and all means of transport obtained by requisition shall be subject to the general rules of international law.  

### Article  36  

Medical aircraft, that is to say, aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of wounded and sick and for the transport of medical personnel and equipment, shall not be attacked, but shall be respected by the belligerents, while flying at heights, times and on routes specifically agreed upon between the belligerents concerned. They shall bear, clearly marked, the distinctive emblem prescribed in Article 38, together with their national colours, on their lower, upper and lateral surfaces. They shall be provided with any other markings or means of identification that may be agreed upon between the belligerents upon the outbreak or during the course of hostilities. Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are prohibited. Medical aircraft shall obey every summons to land. In the event of a landing thus imposed, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its flight after examination, if any. In the event of an involuntary landing in enemy or enemy-occupied territory, the wounded and sick, as well as the crew of the aircraft shall be prisoners of war. The medical personnel shall be treated according to Article 24 and the Articles following.  

### Article  37  

Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph, medical aircraft of Parties to the conflict may fly over the territory of neutral Powers, land on it in case of necessity, or use it as a port of call. They shall give the neutral Powers previous notice of their passage over the said territory and obey all summons to alight, on land or water. They will be immune from attack only when flying on routes, at heights and at times specifically agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict and the neutral Power concerned. The neutral Powers may, however, place conditions or restrictions on the passage or landing of medical aircraft on their territory. Such possible conditions or restrictions shall be applied equally to all Parties to the conflict. Unless agreed otherwise between the neutral Power and the Parties to the conflict, the wounded and sick who are disembarked, with the consent of the local authorities, on neutral territory by medical aircraft, shall be detained by the neutral Power, where so required by international law, in such a manner that they cannot again take part in operations of war. The cost of their accomodation and internment shall be borne by the Power on which they depend.  

### CHAPTER  VII  

####THE DISTINCTIVE EMBLEM

### Article  38  

As a compliment to Switzerland, the heraldic emblem of the red cross on a white ground, formed by reversing the Federal colours, is retained as the emblem and distinctive sign of the Medical Service of armed forces. Nevertheless, in the case of countries which already use as emblem, in place of the red cross, the red crescent or the red lion and sun on a white ground, those emblems are also recognized by the terms of the present Convention.  

### Article  39  

Under the direction of the competent military authority, the emblem shall be displayed on the flags, armlets and on all equipment employed in the Medical Service.  

### Article  40  

The personnel designated in Article 24 and in Articles 26 and 27 shall wear, affixed to the left arm, a water-resistant armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and stamped by the military authority. Such personnel, in addition to wearing the identity disc mentioned in Article 16, shall also carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card shall be water-resistant and of such size that it can be carried in the pocket. It shall be worded in the national language, shall mention at least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the rank and the service number of the bearer, and shall state in what capacity he is entitled to the protection of the present Convention. The card shall bear the photograph of the owner and also either his signature or his finger-prints or both. It shall be embossed with the stamp of the military authority. The identity card shall be uniform throughout the same armed forces and, as far as possible, of a similar type in the armed forces of the High Contracting Parties. The Parties to the conflict may be guided by the model which is annexed, by way of example, to the present Convention. They shall inform each other, at the outbreak of hostilities, of the model they are using. Identity cards should be made out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by the home country. In no circumstances may the said personnel be deprived of their insignia or identits cards nor of the right to wear the armlet. In case of loss, they shall be entitled to receive duplicates of the cards and to have the insignia replaced.  

### Article  41  

The personnel designated in Article 25 shall wear, but only while carrying out medical duties, a white armlet bearing in its centre the distinctive sign in miniature; the armlet shall be issued and stamped by the military authority. Military identity documents to be carried by this type of personnel shall specify what special training they have received, the temporary character of the duties they are engaged upon, and their authority for wearing the armlet.  

### Article  42  

The distinctive flag of the Convention shall be hoisted only over such medical units and establishments as are entitled to be respected under the Convention, and only with the consent of the military authorities. In mobile units, as in fixed establishments, it may be accompanied by the national flag of the Party to the conflict to which the unit or establishment belongs. Nevertheless, medical units which have fallen into the hands of the enemy shall not fly any flag other than that of the Convention. Parties to the conflict shall take the necessary steps, in so far as military considerations permit, to make the distinctive emblems indicating medical units and establishments clearly visible to the enemy land, air or naval forces, in order to obviate the possibility of any hostile action.  

### Article  43  

The medical units belonging to neutral countries, which may have been authorized to lend their services to a belligerent under the conditions laid down in Article 27, shall fly, along with the flag of the Convention, the national flag of that belligerent, wherever the latter makes use of the faculty conferred on him by Article 42. Subject to orders to the contrary by the responsible military authorities, they may, on all occasions, fly their national flag, even if they fall into the hands of the adverse Party.  

### Article  44  

With the exception of the cases mentioned in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the emblem ot the Red Cross on a white ground and the words “Red Cross”, or “Geneva Cross” may not be employed, either in time of peace or in time of war, except to indicate or to protect the medical units and establishments, the personnel and material protected by the present Convention and other Conventions dealing with similar matters. The same shall apply to the emblems mentioned in Article 38, second paragraph, in respect of the countries which use them. The National Red Cross Societies and other Societies designated in Article 26 shall have the right to use the distinctive emblem conferring the protection of the Convention only within the framework of the present paragraph. Furthermore, National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies may, in time of peace, in accordance with their national legislation, make use of the name and emblem of the Red Cross for their other activities which are in conformity with the principles laid down by the International Red Cross Conferences. When those activities are carried out in time of war, the conditions for the use of the emblem shall be such that it cannot be considered as conferring the protection of the Convention; the emblem shall be comparatively small in size and may not be placed on armlets or on the roofs of buildings. The international Red Cross organizations and their duly authorized personnel shall be permitted to make use, at all times, of the emblem of the Red Cross on a white ground. As an exceptional measure, in conformity with national legislation and with the express permission of one of the National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies, the emblem of the Convention may be employed in time of peace to identify vehicles used as ambulances and to mark the position of aid stations exclusively assigned to the purpose of giving free treatment to the wounded or sick.  

### CHAPTER  VIII  

####EXECUTION OF THE CONVENTION

### Article  45  

Each Party to the conflict, acting through its commanders-in-chief, shall ensure the detailed execution of the preceding Articles and provide for unforeseen cases, in conformity with the general principles of the present Convention.  

### Article  46  

Reprisals against the wounded, sick, personnel, buildings or equipment protected by the Convention are prohibited.  

### Article  47  

The High Contracting Parties undertake, in time of peace as in time of war, to disseminate the text of the present Convention as widely as possible in their respective countries, and, in particular, to include the study thereof in their programmes of military and, if possible, civil instruction, so that the principles thereof may become known to the entire population, in particular to the armed fighting forces, the medical personnel and the chaplains.  

### Article  48  

The High Contracting Parties shall communicate to one another through the Swiss Federal Council and, during hostilities, through the Protecting Powers, the official translations of the present Convention, as well as the laws and regulations which they may adopt to ensure the application thereof.  

### CHAPTER  IX  

####REPRESSION OF ABUSES AND INFRACTIONS

### Article  49  

The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in the following Article. Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a *prima facie* case. Each High Contracting Party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other than the grave breaches defined in the following Article. In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided by Article 105 and those following of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949.  

### Article  50  

Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.  

### Article  51  

No High Contracting Party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other High Contracting Party of any liability incurred by itself or by another High Contracting Party in respect of breaches referred to in the preceding Article.  

### Article  52  

At the request of a Party to the conflict, an enquiry shall be instituted, in a manner to be decided between the interested Parties, concerning any alleged violation of the Convention. If agreement has not been reached concerning the procedure for the enquiry, the Parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the procedure to be followed. Once the violation has been established, the Parties to the conflict shall put an end to it and shall repress it with the least possible delay.  

### Article  53  

The use by individuals, societies, firms or companies either public or private, other than those entitled thereto under the present Convention, of the emblem or the designation “Red Cross” or “Geneva Cross”, or any sign or designation constituting an imitation thereof, whatever the object of such use, and irrespective of the date of its adoption, shall be prohibited at all times. By reason of the tribute paid to Switzerland by the adoption of the reversed Federal colours, and of the confusion which may arise between the arms of Switzerland and the distinctive emblem of the Convention, the use by private individuals, societies or firms, of the arms of the Swiss Confederation, or of marks constituting an imitation thereof, whether as trade marks or commercial marks, or as parts of such marks, or for a purpose contrary to commercial honesty, or in circumstances capable of wounding Swiss national sentiment, shall be prohibited at all times. Nevertheless, such High Contracting Parties as were not party to the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, may grant to prior users of the emblems, designations, signs or marks designated in the first paragraph, a time limit not to exceed three years from the coming into force of the precent Convention to discontinue such use, provided that the said use shall not be such as would appear, in time of war, to confer the protection of the Convention. The prohibition laid down in the first paragraph of the present Article shall also apply, without effect on any rights acquired through prior use, to the emblems and marks mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 38.  

### Article  54  

The High Contracting Parties shall, if their legislation is not already adequate, take measures necessary for the prevention and repression, at all times, of the abuses referred to under Article 53.  

####FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article  55  

The present Convention is established in English and in French. Both texts are equally authentic. The Swiss Federal Council shall arrange for official translations of the Convention to be made in the Russian and Spanish languages.  

### Article  56

The Swiss Federal Council shall communicate by the quickest method any ratifications or accessions received from Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  63  

Each of the High Contracting Parties shall be at liberty to denounce the present Convention. The denunciation shall be notified in writing to the Swiss Federal Council, which shall transmit it to the Governments of all the High Contracting Parties. The denunciation shall take effect one year after the notification thereof has been made to the Swiss Federal Council. However, a denunciation of which notification has been made at a time when the denouncing Power is involved in a conflict shall not take effect until peace has been concluded, and until after operations connected with the release and repatriation of the persons protected by the present Convention have been terminated. The denunciation shall have effect only in respect of the denouncing Power. It shall in no way impair the obligations which the Parties to the conflict shall remain bound to fulfil by virtue of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.  

### Article  64  

The Swiss Federal Council shall register the present Convention with the Secretariat of the United Nations. The Swiss Federal Council shall also inform the Secretariat of the United Nations of all ratifications, accessions and denunciations received by it with respect to the present Convention.

####Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949

De ondergetekenden, Gevolmachtigden van de Regeringen, vertegenwoordigd op de Diplomatieke Conferentie welke te Genève van 21 April tot 12 Augustus 1949 is bijeengekomen tot herziening van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de legers te velde, van 27 Juli 1929, zijn het volgende overeengekomen:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  1  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich dit Verdrag onder alle omstandigheden te eerbiedigen en te doen eerbiedigen.  

### Artikel  2  

Onverminderd de bepalingen welke reeds in tijd van vrede in werking moeten treden, is dit Verdrag van toepassing ingeval een oorlog is verklaard of bij ieder ander gewapend conflict dat ontstaat tussen twee of meer der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, zelfs indien de oorlogstoestand door één der Partijen niet wordt erkend. Het Verdrag is eveneens van toepassing in alle gevallen van gehele of gedeeltelijke bezetting van het grondgebied van een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, zelfs indien deze bezetting geen gewapende tegenstand ontmoet. Indien één der in conflict zijnde Mogendheden geen partij is bij dit Verdrag, blijven de Mogendheden die wel partij zijn, niettemin in haar onderlinge betrekkingen hierdoor gebonden. Bovendien zullen zij door het Verdrag gebonden zijn ten opzichte van bedoelde Mogendheid, indien deze de bepalingen daarvan aanvaardt en toepast.  

### Artikel  3  

In geval van een gewapend conflict op het grondgebied van één der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, hetwelk geen internationaal karakter draagt, is ieder der Partijen bij het conflict gehouden ten minste de volgende bepalingen toe te passen: 

1. Personen die niet rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deelnemen, met inbegrip van personeel van strijdkrachten dat de wapens heeft nedergelegd, en zij die buiten gevecht zijn gesteld door ziekte, verwonding, gevangenschap of enige andere oorzaak, moeten onder alle omstandigheden menslievend worden behandeld, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond op ras, huidkleur, godsdienst of geloof, geslacht, geboorte of maatschappelijke welstand of enig ander soortgelijk criterium. Te dien einde zijn en blijven te allen tijde en overal ten aanzien van bovengenoemde personen verboden: 

a. aanslag op het leven en lichamelijke geweldpleging, in het bijzonder het doden op welke wijze ook, verminking, wrede behandeling en marteling;  

b. het nemen van gijzelaars;  

c. aanranding van de persoonlijke waardigheid, in het bijzonder vernederende en onterende behandeling;  

d. het uitspreken en tenuitvoerleggen van vonnissen zonder voorafgaande berechting door een op regelmatige wijze samengesteld gerecht dat alle gerechtelijke waarborgen biedt, door de beschaafde volken als onmisbaar erkend.    

2. De gewonden en zieken moeten worden verzameld en verzorgd.   Een onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, kan haar diensten aan de Partijen bij het conflict aanbieden. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen er verder naar streven door middel van bijzondere overeenkomsten de andere of een deel der andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag van kracht te doen worden. De toepassing van bovenstaande bepalingen zal niet van invloed zijn op de juridische status van de Partijen bij het conflict.  

### Artikel  4  

Onzijdige Mogendheden zullen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag op overeenkomstige wijze toepassen op gewonden en zieken, op leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, die behoren tot de strijdkrachten van de Partijen bij het conflict en die op haar grondgebied worden toegelaten of geïnterneerd, evenals op de gevonden doden.  

### Artikel  5  

Ten aanzien van de beschermde personen die in handen van de vijand zijn gevallen, zal dit Verdrag van toepassing zijn tot het ogenblik waarop hun definitieve repatriëring is voltooid.  

### Artikel  6  

Onverminderd de overeenkomsten, uitdrukkelijk voorzien in de artikelen 10, 15, 23, 28, 31, 36, 37 en 52, kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen andere bijzondere overeenkomsten sluiten betreffende alle aangelegenheden waarvoor zij afzonderlijke regelingen wenselijk achten. Geen bijzondere overeenkomst mag de positie van gewonden en zieken, van leden van het geneeskundig personeel of van geestelijken, zoals in dit Verdrag geregeld, ongunstig beïnvloeden, noch de rechten welke dit hun toekent, beperken. Gewonden en zieken, evenals leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, zullen de voordelen van zodanige overeenkomsten blijven genieten zolang het Verdrag op hen van toepassing is, tenzij uitdrukkelijk het tegendeel is bepaald in bovenbedoelde of nadien gesloten overeenkomsten, dan wel gunstiger maatregelen door één der Partijen bij het conflict ten aanzien van hen zijn genomen.  

### Artikel  7  

Gewonden en zieken, evenals leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, mogen onder geen enkele omstandigheid geheel of gedeeltelijk afstand doen van de rechten welke dit Verdrag en eventueel de bijzondere overeenkomsten, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, hun waarborgen.  

### Artikel  8  

Dit Verdrag zal worden toegepast met de medewerking en onder het toezicht van de beschermende Mogendheden die belast zijn met het behartigen van de belangen van de Partijen bij het conflict. Te dien einde kunnen de beschermende Mogendheden, naast haar diplomatiek of consulair personeel, gedelegeerden benoemen uit haar eigen onderdanen of uit die van andere onzijdige Mogendheden. De benoeming van deze gedelegeerden moet worden onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de Mogendheid bij welke zij hun taak zullen vervullen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zo veel mogelijk de taak van de vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden vergemakkelijken. De vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden mogen in geen geval de grenzen van de hun krachtens dit Verdrag opgedragen taak overschrijden; zij moeten in het bijzonder rekening houden met de gebiedende eisen van veiligheid van de Staat bij welke zij hun taak vervullen. Slechts bij uitzondering kunnen hun werkzaamheden tijdelijk worden beperkt wegens dwingende militaire noodzaak.  

### Artikel  9  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag vormen geen belemmering voor de menslievende werkzaamheden welke, met toestemming van de betrokken Partijen bij het conflict, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie op zich neemt voor de bescherming van gewonden en zieken, geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, alsmede voor aan hen te verlenen hulp.  

### Artikel  10  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen te allen tijde overeenkomen de taak welke krachtens dit Verdrag op de beschermende Mogendheden rust, toe te vertrouwen aan een organisatie die alle waarborgen van onpartijdigheid en doeltreffendheid biedt. Indien gewonden en zieken of geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, om welke reden ook, niet of niet meer de voordelen genieten van de werkzaamheden van een beschermende Mogendheid of van een organisatie, aangewezen overeenkomstig het eerste lid, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een onzijdige Staat of een organisatie, als bovenbedoeld, verzoeken de taak op zich te nemen, welke krachtens dit Verdrag rust op door de Partijen bij het conflict aangewezen beschermende Mogendheden. Indien op deze wijze niet in de bescherming kan worden voorzien, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, verzoeken de menslievende taak, anders krachtens dit Verdrag door beschermende Mogendheden uitgeoefend, op zich te nemen, dan wel, behoudens de bepalingen van dit artikel, het aanbod van de diensten door een zodanige organisatie aanvaarden. Iedere onzijdige Mogendheid of iedere organisatie die door de belanghebbende Mogendheid wordt aangezocht dan wel zich met het bovenbedoeld oogmerk aanbiedt, moet zich bij haar optreden bewust blijven van haar verantwoordelijkheid ten opzichte van de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke de door dit Verdrag beschermde personen behoren, en moet voldoende waarborgen bieden, dat zij in staat is de betreffende taak op zich te nemen en deze op onpartijdige wijze uit te voeren. Van de voorgaande bepalingen mag niet worden afgeweken bij bijzondere overeenkomst tussen Mogendheden van welke zich één ten gevolge van het verloop der krijgsverrichtingen, zelfs tijdelijk, ten opzichte van de andere Mogendheid of haar bondgenoten in haar vrijheid van onderhandelen beperkt ziet, in het bijzonder ingeval het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Mogendheid, of een belangrijk gedeelte daarvan, is bezet. Waar in dit Verdrag wordt gesproken van een beschermende Mogendheid, wordt daaronder begrepen een vervangende organisatie in de zin van dit artikel.  

### Artikel  11  

In alle gevallen waarin zij zulks in het belang van de beschermde personen raadzaam achten, in het bijzonder bij meningsverschil tussen de Partijen bij het conflict over de toepassing of uitlegging van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, zullen de beschermende Mogendheden haar goede diensten verlenen tot oplossing van het geschil. Te dien einde kan ieder der beschermende Mogendheden, op uitnodiging van één Partij of op eigen initiatief, aan de Partijen bij het conflict een bijeenkomst voorstellen van haar vertegenwoordigers, in het bijzonder van de autoriteiten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor gewonden en zieken, geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, eventueel op passend gekozen onzijdig gebied. De Partijen bij het conflict zijn gehouden gevolg te geven aan de voorstellen welke haar tot dit doel worden gedaan. De beschermende Mogendheden kunnen, zo nodig, de Partijen bij het conflict voorstellen de benoeming van een bepaald persoon, behorend tot een onzijdige Mogendheid of afgevaardigd door het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, die zal worden uitgenodigd aan een zodanige bijeenkomst deel te nemen, goed te keuren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Van de gewonden en zieken

### Artikel  12  

De leden van de gewapende macht en andere personen, genoemd in het volgend artikel, die gewond of ziek zijn, moeten onder alle omstandigheden worden ontzien en beschermd. Zij moeten menslievend worden behandeld en verzorgd door de Partij bij het conflict, die hen in haar macht heeft, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond op geslacht, ras, nationaliteit, godsdienst, politieke overtuiging of enig ander soortgelijk criterium. Iedere aanslag op het leven en de persoon is streng verboden; in het bijzonder mogen zij niet worden afgemaakt of uitgeroeid, noch worden onderworpen aan martelingen of biologische proefnemingen; zij mogen niet opzettelijk zonder geneeskundige hulp of verzorging worden gelaten, noch mogen omstandigheden worden geschapen, waardoor zij aan besmetting of infectie worden blootgesteld. Slechts op grond van medische noodzaak is voorrang in behandeling toegestaan. Vrouwen moeten met alle aan haar sekse verschuldigde voorkomendheid worden behandeld. De Partij bij het conflict, die zich genoodzaakt ziet gewonden of zieken aan de vijand over te laten, zal, voor zover de omstandigheden uit militair oogpunt zulks veroorloven, een deel van haar geneeskundig personeel en materieel bij hen achterlaten om mede te werken aan hun verzorging.  

### Artikel  13  

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op de gewonden en zieken die behoren tot de volgende categorieën: 

1. leden van de gewapende macht van een Partij bij het conflict, alsmede leden van de militiën en vrijwilligers-korpsen welke deel uitmaken van deze gewapende macht;  

2. leden van andere militiën en leden van andere vrijwilligers-korpsen, met inbegrip van die van georganiseerde verzetsgroepen, behorend tot een Partij bij het conflict en optredend binnen of buiten het eigen grondgebied, zelfs indien dit grondgebied is bezet, mits deze militiën of vrijwilligers-korpsen, de georganiseerde verzetsgroepen inbegrepen, voldoen aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. onder bevel te staan van een persoon die verantwoordelijk is voor zijn ondergeschikten;  

b. een vast en op enige afstand herkenbaar onderscheidingsteken te hebben;  

c. de wapens openlijk te dragen;  

d. zich in hun handelingen te gedragen naar de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog;    

3. leden van de geregelde strijdkrachten die er zich op beroepen in dienst te staan van een regering of van een autoriteit die niet worden erkend door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid;  

4. personen die de gewapende macht volgen zonder daarvan rechtstreeks deel uit te maken, zoals burgerleden van bemanningen van militaire luchtvaartuigen, oorlogscorrespondenten, leveranciers, leden van werkeenheden of van diensten, belast met de verzorging van het welzijn der militairen, mits zij daartoe machtiging hebben ontvangen van de strijdmacht welke zij begeleiden;  

5. leden van de bemanningen van de koopvaardijvloot, met inbegrip van gezagvoerders, stuurlieden en leerlingen, en de bemanningen van de burgerluchtvaartuigen van de Partijen bij het conflict, die niet een gunstiger behandeling op grond van andere bepalingen van het internationale recht genieten;  

6. de bevolking van een niet-bezet gebied die, bij het naderen van de vijand, uit eigen beweging de wapens opneemt om de invallende troepen te bestrijden, zonder tijd gehad te hebben zien tot geregelde gewapende eenheden te organiseren, mits zij de wapens openlijk draagt en de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog eerbiedigt.    

### Artikel  14  

Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 12, zullen de gewonden en zieken van een oorlogvoerende, die in handen van de vijand vallen, krijgsgevangenen zijn en zullen de regelen van het volkenrecht betreffende krijgsgevangenen op hen van toepassing zijn.  

### Artikel  15  

Te allen tijde, en in het bijzonder na een gevecht, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict onverwijld alle mogelijke maatregelen nemen om de gewonden en zieken op te zoeken en te verzamelen, hen tegen plundering en slechte behandeling te beschermen en hun de nodige verzorging te verzekeren, zomede om de doden op te zoeken en te voorkomen, dat deze worden beroofd. Telkens wanneer de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, zal een wapenstilstand of een onderbreking van het vuren worden overeengekomen of zullen plaatselijke regelingen worden getroffen, ten einde het weghalen, uitwisselen en vervoeren van de op het slagveld achtergebleven gewonden mogelijk te maken. Evenzo kunnen tussen de Partijen bij het conflict plaatselijke regelingen worden getroffen voor de evacuatie of uitwisseling van gewonden en zieken uit een belegerd of omsingeld gebied en voor het doorlaten van geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken en van geneeskundig materieel, bestemd voor dit gebied.  

### Artikel  16  

De Partijen bij het conflict moeten binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd alle gegevens registreren welke van nut kunnen zijn om de in haar handen gevallen gewonden, zieken en doden van de tegenpartij te identificeren. Deze gegevens zullen zo mogelijk bevatten: 

a. aanduiding van de Mogendheid tot welke zij behoren;  

b. leger-, stamboek- of ander contrôlenummer;  

c. geslachtsnaam;  

d. voornaam of voornamen;  

e. geboortedatum;  

f. alle andere gegevens welke op de identiteitskaart of het identiteitsplaatje voorkomen;  

g. datum en plaats van gevangenneming of overlijden;  

h. gegevens betreffende verwondingen, ziekte of doodsoorzaak.   Zo spoedig mogelijk moeten bovengenoemde gegevens worden toegezonden aan het Informatiebureau, bedoeld in artikel 122 van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949, welk Bureau deze inlichtingen door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheid en het Centraal Bureau voor Krijgsgevangenen zal doorgeven aan de Mogendheid tot welke de betrokken personen behoren. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen overlijdensakten of behoorlijk gewaarmerkte lijsten van overledenen opmaken en deze elkander langs de in het voorgaand lid aangegeven weg doen toekomen. Evenzo zullen zij verzamelen de helft van het tweedelige identiteitsplaatje, testamenten of andere bescheiden van waarde voor de familie der overledenen, geld en in het algemeen alle op de doden gevonden voorwerpen welke een wezenlijke dan wel een gevoelswaarde hebben, en deze elkander door tussenkomst van hetzelfde Bureau doen toekomen. Deze voorwerpen, alsmede niet-geïdentificeerde voorwerpen, zullen worden verzonden in verzegelde pakketten, vergezeld van een verklaring, houdende alle bijzonderheden, nodig voor de identificatie van de overleden bezitter, benevens van een volledige inhoudsopgave van het pakket.  

### Artikel  17  

De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zorg dragen, dat het begraven of verbranden der doden, hetgeen voor iedere overledene afzonderlijk, zal plaatsvinden voor zover de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, wordt voorafgegaan door een nauwkeurig en, zo mogelijk, geneeskundig onderzoek van het lichaam, ten einde de dood en de identiteit vast te stellen en het opstellen van een verslag mogelijk te maken. De helft van het tweedelige identiteitsplaatje, of het enkelvoudige plaatje in zijn geheel, zal aan het lijk bevestigd blijven. De lijken mogen alleen worden verbrand indien daarvoor gebiedende hygiënische redenen bestaan, dan wel op grond van redenen, voortvloeiend uit de godsdienst van de overledenen. In geval van verbranding zullen de omstandigheden, benevens de redenen welke daartoe hebben geleid, uitvoerig worden vermeld in de overlijdensakte of op de gewaarmerkte lijst van overledenen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen voorts zorg dragen, dat de doden op eerbiedige wijze, zo mogelijk volgens het ceremonieel van de godsdienst welke zij beleden, worden begraven, dat hun graven worden ontzien en zo mogelijk bijeengebracht volgens de nationaliteit der overledenen, behoorlijk worden onderhouden en zodanig aangeduid, dat zij te allen tijde kunnen worden teruggevonden. Te dien einde zullen zij bij het begin der vijandelijkheden van overheidswege een Gravendienst instellen om, waar ook de graven gelegen zijn, latere opgravingen, identificatie der lijken en eventueel overbrenging naar het land van herkomst mogelijk te maken. Deze bepalingen zijn, in geval van verbranding, eveneens van toepassing op de as, welke door de Gravendienst zal worden bewaard tot het land van herkomst zijn wensen te kennen geeft ten aanzien van de uiteindelijk te nemen maatregelen. Zodra de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven en uiterlijk bij het einde der vijandelijkheden, zullen deze diensten, door tussenkomst van het in het tweede lid van artikel 16 bedoelde Informatiebureau, lijsten uitwisselen, welke de nauwkeurige ligging en de aanduiding der graven vermelden, alsmede de gegevens betreffende de daarin begraven doden.  

### Artikel  18  

De militaire autoriteiten kunnen een beroep doen op de menslievendheid der inwoners om, onder haar toezicht, gewonden en zieken vrijwillig op te nemen en te verzorgen; aan de personen die aan dit beroep gehoor hebben gegeven, zullen zij de nodige bescherming en faciliteiten verlenen. Ingeval de tegenpartij de streek in haar macht mocht krijgen of herkrijgen, zal zij de aan deze personen verleende bescherming en faciliteiten handhaven. De militaire autoriteiten moeten, zelfs bij een inval of in bezet gebied, de inwoners en de verenigingen tot hulpverlening toestaan gewonden of zieken, ongeacht hun nationaliteit, uit eigen beweging op te nemen en te verzorgen. De burgerbevolking moet deze gewonden en zieken ontzien en zich tegenover hen in het bijzonder onthouden van ieder gewelddadig optreden. Niemand mag ooit lastig gevallen of veroordeeld worden wegens het feit, dat hij gewonden of zieken heeft verzorgd. De bepalingen van dit artikel ontheffen de bezettende Mogendheid niet van de verplichtingen welke op haar rusten met betrekking tot de geneeskundige en geestelijke verzorging van de gewonden en zieken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Van de geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen

### Artikel  19  

De vaste inrichtingen en de mobiele geneeskundige formaties van de Geneeskundige Dienst mogen onder geen omstandigheid worden aangevallen, doch moeten te allen tijde door de Partijen bij het conflict worden ontzien en beschermd. Indien zij in handen van de tegenpartij vallen, moeten zij in werking kunnen blijven zolang deze Partij de nodige verzorging van de gewonden en zieken die zich in deze inrichtingen en formaties bevinden, niet zelf heeft verzekerd. De verantwoordelijke autoriteiten zullen zorg dragen, dat bovengenoemde inrichtingen en geneeskundige formaties zich, voor zover mogelijk, op zodanige plaatsen bevinden, dat aanvallen op militaire doelen haar veiligheid niet in gevaar kunnen brengen.  

### Artikel  20  

Hospitaalschepen welke recht hebben op de bescherming van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen van de strijdkrachten ter zee, van 12 Augustus 1949, mogen niet van het land af worden aangevallen.  

### Artikel  21  

De bescherming waarop de vaste inrichtingen en de mobiele geneeskundige formaties van de Geneeskundige Dienst recht hebben, zal niet eindigen, tenzij daarvan, buiten haar menslievende taak, gebruik wordt gemaakt voor het plegen van voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen. De bescherming zal echter eerst eindigen na een sommatie waarbij, in alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen, een redelijke termijn is gesteld en waaraan geen gevolg is gegeven.  

### Artikel  22  

Als redenen welke een geneeskundige formatie of inrichting de door artikel 19 verzekerde bescherming doen verliezen, worden niet beschouwd: 

1. het feit, dat het personeel van de formatie of inrichting gewapend is en van zijn wapens gebruik maakt tot verdediging van zichzelf of van zijn gewonden en zieken;  

2. het feit, dat, bij afwezigheid van gewapende ziekenverplegers, de formatie of inrichting wordt bewaakt door een piket, door schildwachten of door een geleide;  

3. het feit, dat in de formatie of inrichting draagbare wapens en munitie worden aangetroffen welke aan de gewonden en zieken zijn ontnomen en nog niet aan de bevoegde tak van dienst zijn afgeleverd;  

4. het feit, dat zich bij de formatie of inrichting personeel en materieel van de diergeneeskundige dienst bevinden, zonder daarvan een wezenlijk deel uit te maken;  

5. het feit, dat de menslievende werkzaamheden van de geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen of van haar personeel zich uitstrekken tot de verzorging van burgergewonden of -zieken.    

### Artikel  23  

In tijd van vrede kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en, na het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, de Partijen bij het conflict, op haar eigen grondgebied en, zo nodig, in bezet gebied, hospitalisatiegebieden en -plaatsen instellen, zodanig ingericht, dat zij aan de gewonden en zieken en aan het personeel, belast met de organisatie en het beheer van deze gebieden en plaatsen en met de verzorging van de daarin bijeengebrachte personen, bescherming bieden tegen het oorlogsgeweld. Bij het uitbreken van een conflict en tijdens de vijandelijkheden kunnen de betrokken Partijen overeenkomsten sluiten tot erkenning van de hospitalisatiegebieden en -plaatsen welke zij hebben ingesteld. Zij kunnen te dien einde de bepalingen, opgenomen in de ontwerpovereenkomst welke als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is gehecht, in werking doen treden, eventueel met de wijzigingen welke zij nodig mochten achten. De beschermende Mogendheden en het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis worden uitgenodigd hun goede diensten te verlenen om de instelling en erkenning van deze hospitalisatiegebieden en -plaatsen te vergemakkelijken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Van het personeel

### Artikel  24  

Het geneeskundig personeel, uitsluitend belast met het opzoeken, verzamelen, vervoeren of behandelen van gewonden en zieken of met het voorkomen van ziekten, het personeel, uitsluitend belast met het beheer van geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen, alsmede de aan de strijdkrachten verbonden geestelijken, moeten onder alle omstandigheden worden ontzien en beschermd.  

### Artikel  25  

Militairen, speciaal opgeleid om eventueel als hulpziekenverpleger of hulpziekendrager te worden gebruikt voor het opzoeken, verzamelen, vervoeren of behandelen van gewonden en zieken, moeten eveneens worden ontzien en beschermd indien zij deze werkzaamheden verrichten op het ogenblik, dat zij met de vijand in aanraking komen of in diens handen vallen.  

### Artikel  26  

Met het in artikel 24 bedoelde personeel wordt gelijkgesteld het personeel van de nationale Rode Kruis Verenigingen en dat van andere door haar Regering erkende en toegelaten verenigingen tot vrijwillige hulpverlening, dat wordt gebruikt voor dezelfde werkzaamheden als het in genoemd artikel bedoelde personeel, mits het personeel dezer verenigingen onderworpen is aan de militaire wetten en reglementen. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zal de andere Partij, hetzij reeds in tijd van vrede, hetzij bij het begin van of gedurende de vijandelijkheden, in ieder geval alvorens daarvan enig werkelijk gebruik te maken, in kennis stellen met de namen der verenigingen die zij toegelaten heeft om, onder haar verantwoordelijkheid, aan de officiële geneeskundige dienst van haar strijdkrachten medewerking te verlenen.  

### Artikel  27  

Een erkende vereniging van een onzijdig land kan de medewerking van haar personeel en geneeskundige formaties aan een Partij bij het conflict slechts verlenen na voorafgaande goedkeuring van haar eigen Regering en met machtiging van de betrokken Partij bij het conflict. Dit personeel en deze formaties zullen onder het toezicht van die Partij bij het conflict worden gesteld. De onzijdige Regering zal de tegenpartij van de Staat die deze medewerking aanvaardt, in kennis stellen met die goedkeuring. De Partij bij het conflict, die deze medewerking heeft aanvaard, is gehouden zulks aan de tegenpartij mede te delen, alvorens daarvan enig gebruik te maken. Onder geen omstandigheid mag deze medewerking als een inmenging in het conflict worden beschouwd. De leden van het in het eerste lid bedoelde personeel moeten, vóór zij het onzijdige land waartoe zij behoren, verlaten, behoorlijk worden voorzien van de identiteitsbewijzen, bedoeld in artikel 40.  

### Artikel  28  

Het in de artikelen 24 en 26 genoemde personeel zal, indien het in handen van de tegenpartij valt, slechts worden aangehouden voor zover de gezondheidstoestand, de geestelijke behoeften en het aantal der krijgsgevangenen zulks vereisen. De leden van het personeel die op deze wijze worden aangehouden, zullen niet als krijgsgevangenen worden beschouwd. Niettemin zullen zij ten minste de voordelen genieten van alle bepalingen van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949. In het kader van de militaire wetten en reglementen van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid en onder het toezicht van de bevoegde diensten van deze Mogendheid, zullen zij, in overeenstemming met hun ethische opvattingen omtrent hun beroep, hun geneeskundige of geestelijke werkzaamheden voortzetten ten behoeve van de krijgsgevangenen, bij voorkeur van de strijdkrachten waartoe zij behoren. Voor de vervulling van hun geneeskundige of geestelijke taak genieten zij bovendien de volgende faciliteiten: 

a. Zij zijn gemachtigd op geregelde tijden de krijgsgevangenen die zich in werkgroepen of hospitalen buiten het kamp bevinden, te bezoeken. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal voor dit doel de benodigde vervoermiddelen te hunner beschikking stellen.  

b. In ieder kamp is de oudste militaire arts in de hoogste rang tegenover de militaire autoriteiten van het kamp verantwoordelijk voor de werkzaamheden van het aangehouden geneeskundig personeel. Te dien einde zullen de Partijen bij het conflict zich van het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden af met elkander verstaan omtrent de overeenstemming van de rangen van haar geneeskundig personeel, met inbegrip van het personeel van de in artikel 26 bedoelde verenigingen. Voor alle aangelegenheden, voortvloeiend uit hun taak, hebben deze arts en de geestelijken rechtstreeks toegang tot de bevoegde autoriteiten van het kamp. Deze zullen hun alle faciliteiten verlenen, nodig voor de met deze aangelegenheden verband houdende correspondentie.  

c. Het aangehouden personeel, hoewel onderworpen aan de interne discipline van het kamp waarin het zich bevindt, mag niet tot enige werkzaamheid, buiten zijn geneeskundige of geestelijke taak vallend, worden gedwongen.   Gedurende de vijandelijkheden zullen de Partijen bij het conflict zich met elkander verstaan omtrent een mogelijke aflossing van het aangehouden personeel en de regeling daarvan vaststellen. Geen der voorgaande bepalingen ontheft de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid van de verplichtingen welke op haar rusten met betrekking tot de geneeskundige en geestelijke verzorging van de krijgsgevangenen.  

### Artikel  29  

Het in artikel 25 genoemde personeel dat in handen van de vijand is gevallen, zal als krijgsgevangen worden beschouwd, maar zal, voor zover de noodzaak zich daartoe doet gevoelen, voor geneeskundige werkzaamheden worden gebruikt.  

### Artikel  30  

Leden van het personeel wier aanhouding niet noodzakelijk is krachtens de bepalingen van artikel 28, zullen worden teruggezonden naar de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke zij behoren, zodra een weg voor hun terugkeer openstaat en de militaire vereisten zulks toelaten. In afwachting van hun terugzending zullen zij niet als krijgsgevangenen worden beschouwd. Niettemin zullen zij ten minste de voordelen genieten van alle bepalingen van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949. Zij zullen hun werkzaamheden voortzetten onder leiding van de tegenpartij en bij voorkeur worden belast met de verzorging van de gewonden en zieken van de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke zij behoren. Bij hun vertrek zullen zij hun goederen, persoonlijke bezittingen, voorwerpen van waarde en de instrumenten welke hun toebehoren, medenemen.  

### Artikel  31  

De keuze van het personeel dat krachtens artikel 30 wordt teruggezonden, zal worden gedaan met uitsluiting van iedere overweging, gegrond op ras, godsdienst of politieke overtuiging, bij voorkeur overeenkomstig de chronologische volgorde van hun gevangenneming en hun gezondheidstoestand. Van het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden af, kunnen de Partijen bij het conflict bij bijzondere overeenkomst het percentage vaststellen van het in verhouding tot het aantal krijgsgevangenen aan te houden personeel, alsmede de verdeling van dit personeel over de kampen.  

### Artikel  32  

De in artikel 27 genoemde personen die in handen van de tegenpartij zijn gevallen, mogen niet worden aangehouden. Tenzij anders overeengekomen, zal hun worden toegestaan naar hun land, of, indien zulks onmogelijk is, naar het grondgebied van de Partij bij het conflict, in wier dienst zij waren, terug te keren, zodra een weg daartoe openstaat en de militaire vereisten zulks toelaten. In afwachting van hun terugkeer zullen zij hun werkzaamheden onder leiding van de tegenpartij voortzetten; bij voorkeur zullen zij worden belast met de verzorging van de gewonden en zieken van de Partij bij het conflict, in wier dienst zij waren. Bij hun vertrek zullen zij hun goederen, persoonlijke bezittingen en voorwerpen van waarde, benevens de instrumenten, de wapens en zo mogelijk de vervoermiddelen welke hun toebehoren, medenemen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen aan dit personeel, zolang het zich in haar macht bevindt, dezelfde verpleging, huisvesting, toelagen en bezoldiging waarborgen als aan het overeenkomstig personeel van haar eigen krijgsmacht. In ieder geval moet de voeding, wat betreft hoeveelheid, hoedanigheid en afwisseling, voldoende zijn om de betrokkenen een normale gezondheidstoestand te waarborgen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Van de gebouwen en het materieel

### Artikel  33  

Het materieel van de mobiele geneeskundige formaties van de strijdkrachten, welke in handen van de vijand vallen, zal bestemd blijven voor de verzorging van gewonden en zieken. De gebouwen, het materieel en de voorraden der vaste geneeskundige inrichtingen van de strijdkrachten blijven aan het oorlogsrecht onderworpen, maar mogen niet aan hun bestemming worden onttrokken zolang zij voor de verzorging van gewonden en zieken nodig zijn. Niettemin mogen de bevelhebbers van de legers te velde daarvan, in geval van dwingende militaire noodzaak, gebruik maken, mits zij tevoren de nodige maatregelen hebben genomen voor de verzorging van de daarin verpleegde gewonden en zieken. Het materieel en de voorraden, bedoeld in dit artikel, mogen niet opzettelijk worden vernietigd.  

### Artikel  34  

De roerende en onroerende goederen der verenigingen tot hulpverlening, aan wie de bij het Verdrag geregelde bevoorrechte positie is verleend, worden als particulier eigendom beschouwd. Het door de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog aan de oorlogvoerenden toegekend recht van vordering zal slechts in geval van dwingende noodzaak worden uitgeoefend en alleen nadat de verzorging van de gewonden en zieken is veilig gesteld.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Van de geneeskundige transporten

### Artikel  35  

Transporten van gewonden en zieken of van geneeskundig materieel moeten op dezelfde wijze worden ontzien en beschermd als mobiele geneeskundige formaties. Wanneer deze transporten of voertuigen in handen van de tegenpartij vallen, zullen zij aan het oorlogsrecht zijn onderworpen, mits de Partij bij het conflict, die deze buitmaakt, zich in alle gevallen belast met de verzorging van de zich daarin bevindende gewonden en zieken. Het burgerpersoneel en alle door vordering verkregen vervoermiddelen zullen aan de algemene regelen van het volkenrecht onderworpen zijn.  

### Artikel  36  

Hospitaalvliegtuigen, waaronder te verstaan vliegtuigen welke uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor de evacuatie van gewonden en zieken dan wel voor het vervoer van geneeskundig personeel en materieel, mogen niet worden aangevallen, maar moeten door de oorlogvoerenden worden ontzien zolang zij vliegen op hoogten, op tijden en volgens routes, zoals deze uitdrukkelijk bij overeenkomst tussen alle betrokken oorlogvoerenden zijn vastgesteld. Zij moeten op hun onder-, boven- en zijvlakken, behalve van de nationale kleuren, duidelijk zichtbaar voorzien zijn van het in artikel 38 bedoelde kenteken. Zij zullen ieder ander kenmerk of herkenningsteken voeren dat bij het uitbreken van of gedurende de vijandelijkheden bij overeenkomst tussen de oorlogvoerenden mocht zijn vastgesteld. Tenzij anders overeengekomen, is het overvliegen van vijandelijk of door de vijand bezet gebied verboden. Hospitaalvliegtuigen moeten aan iedere sommatie om te landen gevolg geven. In geval van een zodanige gedwongen landing mag het vliegtuig met de inzittenden, na een eventueel onderzoek, zijn vlucht vervolgen. In geval van een noodlanding op vijandelijk of door de vijand bezet gebied zullen de gewonden en zieken, evenals de bemanning van het vliegtuig, krijgsgevangenen zijn. Het geneeskundig personeel zal worden behandeld overeenkomstig artikel 24 en volgende.  

### Artikel  37  

De hospitaalvliegtuigen van de Partijen bij het conflict mogen, behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede lid, over het grondgebied van onzijdige Mogendheden vliegen, daarop in geval van nood landen of een tussenlanding maken. Zij moeten de onzijdige Mogendheden tevoren in kennis stellen met hun vlucht over het betrokken grondgebied en aan iedere sommatie om te landen of op het water neer te strijken gevolg geven. Zij mogen niet worden aangevallen zolang zij vliegen op hoogten, op tijden en volgens routes, zoals deze uitdrukkelijk bij overeenkomst tussen de Partijen bij het conflict en de betrokken onzijdige Mogendheden zijn vastgesteld. De onzijdige Mogendheden kunnen echter aan het overvliegen van of het landen op haar grondgebied door hospitaalvliegtuigen voorwaarden of beperkingen verbinden. Zodanige voorwaarden of beperkingen zullen ten aanzien van alle Partijen bij het conflict gelijkelijk worden toegepast. Tenzij tussen de onzijdige Staat en de Partijen bij het conflict anders is overeengekomen, moeten de gewonden en zieken die met toestemming van de plaatselijke autoriteiten door een hospitaalvliegtuig op onzijdig gebied worden ontscheept, in de gevallen waarin het internationale recht zulks voorschrijft, op zodanige wijze door de onzijdige Staat worden bewaakt, dat zij niet opnieuw aan de krijgsverrichtingen kunnen deelnemen. De hospitaal- en interneringskosten zullen worden gedragen door de Mogendheid tot welke de gewonden en zieken behoren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Van het kenteken

### Artikel  38  

Als hulde aan Zwitserland wordt het heraldieke teken van het rode kruis op wit veld, gevormd door het verwisselen van de bondskleuren, als embleem en kenteken van de Geneeskundige Dienst der legers gehandhaafd. Evenwel worden voor de landen die reeds, in plaats van het rode kruis, de rode halve maan of de rode leeuw en zon op wit veld als kenteken gebruiken, deze emblemen eveneens in de zin van dit Verdrag erkend.  

### Artikel  39  

Onder toezicht van de bevoegde militaire autoriteit, zal het embleem worden gevoerd op de vlaggen, de armbanden en op al het door de Geneeskundige Dienst gebruikte materieel.  

### Artikel  40  

Het personeel, bedoeld in artikel 24 en in de artikelen 26 en 27, zal een door de bevoegde militaire autoriteit verstrekte en gestempelde band welke tegen vocht bestand is en voorzien is van het kenteken, aan de linkerarm vastgehecht, dragen. Dit personeel zal, behalve het in artikel 16 bedoelde identiteitsplaatje, een speciale identiteitskaart bij zich dragen, welke is voorzien van het kenteken. Deze kaart moet tegen vocht bestand zijn en van zodanige afmetingen, dat zij in de zak kan worden gedragen. Zij zal worden opgesteld in de landstaal, ten minste de geslachtsnaam en voornamen, de geboortedatum, de rang en het leger- of stamboeknummer van de houder vermelden en tevens aantonen op grond van welke hoedanigheid hij recht heeft op de bescherming van dit Verdrag. De kaart zal voorzien zijn van een fotografie van de houder en voorts hetzij van zijn handtekening hetzij van zijn vingerafdrukken, dan wel van beide, alsmede van het droogstempel van de bevoegde militaire autoriteit. De identiteitskaart moet voor iedere krijgsmacht van één standaardmodel zijn en, voor zover mogelijk, bij de krijgsmachten van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen van eenzelfde model. De Partijen bij het conflict kunnen zich laten leiden door het model dat bij wijze van voorbeeld als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is gehecht. Zij zullen elkander, bij het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, inlichten omtrent het model dat zij gebruiken. Iedere identiteitskaart zal, zo mogelijk, ten minste in tweevoud worden opgemaakt; één exemplaar zal worden bewaard door de eigen Mogendheid. In geen geval mogen aan het hierboven bedoelde personeel de onderscheidingstekenen of de identiteitskaart worden ontnomen, noch het recht worden ontzegd de armband te dragen. Bij verlies heeft dit personeel recht op verstrekking van een duplicaat van de kaart en op vervanging van de onderscheidingstekenen.  

### Artikel  41  

Het in artikel 25 bedoelde personeel zal, echter uitsluitend bij het verrichten van zijn geneeskundige werkzaamheden, een witte armband dragen, waarop in het midden het kenteken in verkleinde afmetingen voorkomt; deze band zal worden verstrekt en gestempeld door de bevoegde militaire autoriteit. Op de militaire identiteitsbewijzen welke dit personeel draagt, zullen de door de houder ontvangen geneeskundige opleiding, het tijdelijke karakter van zijn werkzaamheden en zijn recht tot het dragen van de armband nauwkeurig worden aangegeven.  

### Artikel  42  

De onderscheidingsvlag van het Verdrag mag slechts worden gevoerd door de geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen welke krachtens het Verdrag worden beschermd, en uitsluitend met toestemming van de militaire autoriteiten. Door mobiele formaties en vaste inrichtingen kan daarnaast de nationale vlag van de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke de formatie of inrichting behoort, worden gevoerd. Geneeskundige formaties welke in handen van de vijand zijn gevallen, mogen echter alleen de vlag van het Verdrag voeren. Voor zover de militaire vereisten zulks toelaten, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict de nodige maatregelen nemen om de kentekenen welke de geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen aanduiden, duidelijk zichtbaar te maken voor de vijandelijke strijdkrachten te land, in de lucht en ter zee, ten einde iedere mogelijkheid van een aanval te voorkomen.  

### Artikel  43  

De geneeskundige formaties van onzijdige landen, welke op de in artikel 27 bedoelde voorwaarden zijn toegelaten om haar diensten aan een oorlogvoerende te verlenen, moeten, naast de vlag van het Verdrag, de nationale vlag van deze oorlogvoerende voeren, indien deze gebruik maakt van de bevoegdheid welke artikel 42 hem verleent. Behoudens tegenbevel van de bevoegde militaire autoriteiten, mogen zij onder alle omstandigheden haar nationale vlag voeren, zelfs indien zij in handen van de tegenpartij vallen.  

### Artikel  44  

Met uitzondering van de in de volgende leden van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen, mogen het embleem van het rode kruis op wit veld en de woorden „Rode Kruis” of „Kruis van Genève”, zowel in tijd van vrede als in tijd van oorlog, slechts worden gebruikt tot aanduiding of bescherming van de geneeskundige formaties en inrichtingen en van het personeel en materieel welke worden beschermd door dit Verdrag of door andere, soortgelijke aangelegenheden regelende, internationale Verdragen. Hetzelfde geldt voor de in artikel 38, lid twee, bedoelde emblemen met betrekking tot de landen die deze gebruiken. De nationale Rode Kruis Verenigingen en de andere in artikel 26 bedoelde verenigingen hebben slechts binnen het kader van de bepalingen van dit lid het recht om het de bescherming van het Verdrag verlenende kenteken te gebruiken. Bovendien mogen de nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon) Verenigingen in vredestijd, overeenkomstig haar nationale wetgeving, gebruik maken van de naam en het embleem van het Rode Kruis voor haar andere werkzaamheden, welke in overeenstemming zijn met de door de Internationale Rode Kruis Conferenties vastgestelde beginselen. Wanneer deze werkzaamheden in oorlogstijd worden voortgezet, moeten de omstandigheden waaronder het embleem wordt gebruikt, zodanig zijn, dat zulks niet kan worden geacht de bescherming van het Verdrag te verlenen; het embleem zal naar verhouding van kleine afmetingen zijn en mag niet worden aangebracht op armbanden of op daken van gebouwen. De internationale Rode Kruis organisaties en haar behoorlijk van legitimatiebewijzen voorziene personeel zijn te allen tijde gerechtigd gebruik te maken van het embleem van het rode kruis op wit veld. Bij wijze van uitzondering, overeenkomstig de nationale wetgeving en met uitdrukkelijke machtiging van één der nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon) Verenigingen, mag van het embleem van het Verdrag in vredestijd gebruik worden gemaakt om voertuigen welke als ambulance worden gebruikt, aan te duiden en om de plaats aan te geven van hulpposten welke uitsluitend zijn bestemd om kosteloos gewonden of zieken te behandelen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####Van de tenuitvoerlegging van het Verdrag

### Artikel  45  

Iedere Partij bij het conflict zal, door tussenkomst van haar opperbevelhebbers, nadere voorzieningen treffen voor de uitvoering van de voorgaande artikelen, alsmede voor onvoorziene gevallen, overeenkomstig de algemene beginselen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  46  

Represaillemaatregelen ten aanzien van gewonden, zieken, personeel, gebouwen of materieel, beschermd door het Verdrag, zijn verboden.  

### Artikel  47  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich de tekst van dit Verdrag, zowel in tijd van vrede als in tijd van oorlog, zo ruim mogelijk in haar onderscheiden landen te verspreiden en in het bijzonder de bestudering daarvan in de programma's van haar militaire en, zo mogelijk, burgerlijke opleiding op te nemen, zodat de beginselen daarvan aan de gehele bevolking, in het bijzonder aan de strijdende troepen, het geneeskundig personeel en de geestelijken, bekend worden.  

### Artikel  48  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen elkander door tussenkomst van de Zwitserse Bondsraad en, tijdens de vijandelijkheden, door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheden de officiële vertalingen van dit Verdrag mededelen, benevens de wetten en voorschriften welke zij mochten aannemen om de toepassing daarvan te verzekeren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IX  

####Van het tegengaan van misbruiken en inbreuken

### Artikel  49  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich alle wettelijke regelingen tot stand te brengen, nodig om doeltreffende strafbepalingen vast te stellen voor personen die één der ernstige inbreuken op dit Verdrag, omschreven in het volgend artikel, hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan hebben gegeven. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij is verplicht personen die ervan verdacht worden één van deze ernstige inbreuken te hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan te hebben gegeven, op te sporen en moet hen, ongeacht hun nationaliteit, voor haar eigen gerechten brengen. Zij kan hen ook, indien zij daaraan de voorkeur geeft, en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van haar eigen wetgeving, ter berechting overleveren aan een andere bij de vervolging belang hebbende Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, mits deze Verdragsluitende Partij een met voldoende bewijzen gestaafde telastlegging welke een vervolging rechtvaardigt, tegen de betrokken personen inbrengt. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zal maatregelen nemen, nodig om de met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag strijdige handelingen welke niet vallen onder de in het volgend artikel omschreven ernstige inbreuken, tegen te gaan. Onder alle omstandigheden zullen de verdachten de waarborgen genieten voor een behoorlijke berechting en verdediging, welke niet minder gunstig mogen zijn dan die, voorgeschreven in artikel 105 en volgende van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  50  

De ernstige inbreuken, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, zijn die welke één der volgende handelingen in zich sluiten, indien deze worden gepleegd tegen door het Verdrag beschermde personen of goederen: opzettelijke levensberoving, marteling of onmenselijke behandeling, waaronder begrepen biologische proefnemingen, het moedwillig veroorzaken van hevig lijden, van ernstig lichamelijk letsel, dan wel van ernstige schade aan de gezondheid, vernieling en toeëigening van goederen, niet gerechtvaardigd door militaire noodzaak en uitgevoerd op grote schaal en op onrechtmatige en moedwillige wijze.  

### Artikel  51  

Geen der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen mag zich zelf of een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij onttrekken aan enige op haar of op een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij rustende aansprakelijkheid op grond van de in het voorgaand artikel bedoelde inbreuken.  

### Artikel  52  

Op verzoek van een Partij bij het conflict moet, op een door de belanghebbende Partijen overeen te komen wijze, een onderzoek worden ingesteld naar iedere beweerde schending van het Verdrag. Indien geen overeenstemming over de procedure van het onderzoek wordt bereikt, zullen de Partijen zich met elkander verstaan over de keuze van een scheidsrechter, die omtrent de te volgen procedure zal beslissen. Wanneer de schending is vastgesteld, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict daaraan een einde maken en deze zo spoedig mogelijk bestraffen.  

### Artikel  53  

Het is te allen tijde verboden, dat particulieren, verenigingen of vennootschappen, zowel publieke als particuliere, die daartoe krachtens dit Verdrag niet zijn gerechtigd, gebruik maken van het embleem of de benaming „Rode Kruis” of „Kruis van Genève”, evenals van ieder teken of iedere benaming welke daarvan een nabootsing is, overschillig het doel van dit gebruik en het ogenblik waarop dit een aanvang heeft genomen. Met het oog op de aan Zwitserland door het aannemen van de verwisselde bondskleuren gebrachte hulde en de verwarring welke kan ontstaan tussen het wapen van Zwitserland en het kenteken van het Verdrag, is het te allen tijde verboden, dat particulieren, verenigingen of vennootschappen gebruik maken van het wapen van de Zwitserse Bond, evenals van ieder teken dat daarvan een nabootsing is, hetzij als fabrieks- of handelsmerk of als onderdeel van een zodanig merk, hetzij met enig doel, strijdig met de goede trouw in de handel, hetzij onder omstandigheden welke het Zwitserse nationale gevoel zouden kunnen krenken. Echter kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen die geen partij waren bij het Verdrag van Genève van 27 Juli 1929, aan degenen die de in het eerste lid bedoelde emblemen, benamingen of merken reeds tevoren gebruikten, een uitstel verlenen van ten hoogste drie jaar, gerekend van het ogenblik van de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, om aan het gebruik daarvan een einde te maken, met dien verstande, dat tijdens dit uitstel het gebruik ervan, in tijd van oorlog, niet de schijn mag wekken de bescherming van het Verdrag te verlenen. Het verbod, vervat in het eerste lid van dit artikel, geldt, zonder van invloed te zijn op de door eerder gebruik verkregen rechten, eveneens voor de in het tweede lid van artikel 38 bedoelde emblemen en benamingen.  

### Artikel  54  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen, indien haar wetgeving thans daarin nog niet volledig voorziet, maatregelen nemen, nodig om te allen tijde misbruik, bedoeld in artikel 53, tegen te gaan en te bestraffen.  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  55

####Ontwerp-overeenkomst betreffende hospitalisatiegebieden en -plaatsen

### Artikel  1  

De hospitalisatiegebieden zullen uitsluitend bestemd zijn voor personen, genoemd in artikel 23 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949, alsmede voor het personeel, belast met de organisatie en het beheer van deze gebieden en plaatsen en met de verzorging van de daarin bijeengebrachte personen. Echter hebben de personen die hun vaste woonplaats in deze gebieden hebben, het recht daar te blijven.  

### Artikel  2  

Personen die zich, in welke hoedanigheid ook, in een hospitalisatiegebied bevinden, mogen noch binnen noch buiten dit gebied enige werkzaamheid verrichten, welke rechtstreeks verband houdt met de krijgsverrichtingen of met de vervaardiging van oorlogsmaterieel.  

### Artikel  3  

De Mogendheid die een hospitalisatiegebied instelt, zal alle nodige maatregelen nemen om de toegang te ontzeggen aan alle personen die niet gerechtigd zijn het te betreden of zich aldaar te bevinden.  

### Artikel  4  

Hospitalisatiegebieden moeten aan de volgende voorwaarden voldoen: 

a. zij mogen slechts een klein gedeelte omvatten van het grondgebied dat onder het gezag staat van de Mogendheid die deze gebieden heeft ingesteld;  

b. zij moeten, in verhouding tot hun opnemingsmogelijkheden, dun bevolkt zijn;  

c. zij mogen geen enkel militair doel noch enige belangrijke industriële of administratieve instelling bevatten, noch in de nabijheid daarvan zijn gelegen;  

d. zij mogen niet gelegen zijn in streken welke, naar alle waarschijnlijkheid, van belang kunnen worden voor de oorlogvoering.    

### Artikel  5  

Voor hospitalisatiegebieden gelden de volgende verplichtingen: 

a. de aan- en afvoerwegen en de vervoermiddelen welke zij bevatten, mogen niet worden gebruikt voor de verplaatsing van militair personeel of materieel, zelfs niet voor doorvoer;  

b. zij mogen onder geen omstandigheid militair worden verdedigd.    

### Artikel  6  

Hospitalisatiegebieden zullen worden aangeduid door langs de omtrek en op de gebouwen aangebrachte rode kruizen (rode halve manen, rode leeuwen en zonnen) op wit veld. Des nachts kunnen zij eveneens door een passende verlichting worden aangeduid.  

### Artikel  7  

Iedere Mogendheid zal in tijd van vrede of bij het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden aan alle Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen een lijst van de hospitalisatiegebieden, ingesteld op het onder haar gezag staand grondgebied, doen toekomen. Zij zal eveneens kennis geven van ieder nieuw hospitalisatiegebied dat gedurende de vijandelijkheden wordt ingesteld. Zodra de tegenpartij de hierboven vermelde kennisgeving heeft ontvangen, is het gebied volgens de regels ingesteld. Indien evenwel de tegenpartij van oordeel is, dat aan één van de voorwaarden van deze overeenkomst niet is voldaan, kan zij weigeren dit gebied te erkennen door zulks onmiddellijk te berichten aan de Partij, die verantwoordelijk is voor het bedoelde gebied, dan wel haar erkenning afhankelijk maken van de instelling van het toezicht, bedoeld in artikel 8.  

### Artikel  8  

Iedere Mogendheid die één of meer door de tegenpartij ingestelde hospitalisatiegebieden heeft erkend, heeft het recht te eisen, dat één of meer bijzondere commissies toezien of de gebieden aan de in deze overeenkomst voorgeschreven voorwaarden en verplichtingen voldoen. Te dien einde hebben de leden van de bijzondere commissies te allen tijde vrije toegang tot de verschillende gebieden en kunnen daar zelfs permanent verblijf houden. Ten behoeve van de uitoefening van hun toezicht zullen hun alle faciliteiten worden verleend.  

### Artikel  9  

Ingeval de bijzondere commissies feiten zouden vaststellen welke hun in strijd met de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst voorkomen, zullen zij onmiddellijk de aandacht van de Mogendheid die het betreffende gebied beheert, daarop vestigen en haar een termijn van ten hoogste vijf dagen toestaan om in de aangelegenheid te voorzien; zij zullen de Mogendheid die het gebied heeft erkend, daarmede in kennis stellen. Indien, na verloop van deze termijn, de Mogendheid die het gebied onder haar gezag heeft, geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan de tot haar gerichte waarschuwing, kan de tegenpartij verklaren, dat zij, wat betreft dit gebied, niet langer door deze overeenkomst is gebonden.  

### Artikel  10  

De Mogendheid die één of meer hospitalisatiegebieden en -plaatsen heeft ingesteld, en de tegenpartijen die met het bestaan daarvan in kennis zijn gesteld, zullen de personen benoemen die deel zullen uitmaken van de in de artikelen 8 en 9 bedoelde bijzondere commissies, of hen door onzijdige Mogendheden doen benoemen.  

### Artikel  11  

Hospitalisatiegebieden mogen onder geen omstandigheid worden aangevallen, maar moeten te allen tijde door de Partijen bij het conflict worden beschermd en ontzien.  

### Artikel  12  

In geval van bezetting van een grondgebied, moet men de zich daarin bevindende hospitalisatiegebieden blijven ontzien; deze moeten als zodanig in gebruik blijven. De bezettende Mogendheid mag evenwel de bestemming daarvan wijzigen, mits alle maatregelen zijn genomen om de veiligheid van de daarin bijeengebrachte personen te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  13  

Deze overeenkomst is eveneens van toepassing op plaatsen welke de Mogendheden voor dezelfde doeleinden als hospitalisatiegebieden zouden gebruiken.
