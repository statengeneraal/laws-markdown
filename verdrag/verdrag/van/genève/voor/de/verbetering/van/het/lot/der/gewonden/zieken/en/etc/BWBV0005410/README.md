####GENEVA CONVENTION FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE CONDITION OF WOUNDED, SICK AND SHIPWRECKED MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES AT SEA OF AUGUST 12, 1949

The undersigned Plenipotentiaries of the Governments represented at Diplomatic Conference held at Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949, for purpose of revising the Xth Hague Convention of October 18, 1907 for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention of 1906, have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  1  

The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.  

### Article  2  

In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  

### Article  3  

In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: 

(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed *hors de combat* by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: 

(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;  

(b) taking of hostages;  

(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment;  

(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.    

(2) The wounded, sick and shipwrecked shall be collected and cared for.   An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  4  

In case of hostilities between land and naval forces of Parties to the conflict, the provisions of the present Convention shall apply only to forces on board ship. Forces put ashore shall immediately become subject to the provisions of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.  

### Article  5  

Neutral Powers shall apply by analogy the provisions of the present Convention to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, and to members of the medical personnel and to chaplains of the armed forces of the Parties to the conflict received or in their territory, as well as to dead persons found.  

### Article  6  

In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 10,18, 31, 38, 39, 40, 43 and 53, the High Contracting Parties may conclude other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, of members of the medical personnel or of chaplains, as defined by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them. Wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, as well as medical personnel and chaplains, shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as long as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions to the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one or other of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  7  

Wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, as well as members of the medical personnel and chaplains, may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.  

### Article  8  

The present Convention shall be applied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the aproval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties. The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible the task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers. The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular, take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they carry out their duties. Their activities shall only be restricted as an exceptional and temporary measure when this is rendered necessary by imperative military necessities.  

### Article  9  

The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, medical personnel and chaplains, and for their relief.  

### Article  10  

The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention. When wounded, sick and shipwrecked, or medical personnel and chaplains do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict. If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by Protecting Powers under the present Convention. Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and to discharge them impartially. No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied. Whenever, in the present Convention, mention is made of a Protecting Power, such mention also applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present Article.  

### Article  11  

In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons, particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement. For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, medical personnel and chaplains, possibly on neutral territory suitable chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part in such a meeting.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####WOUNDED, SICK AND SHIPWRECKED

### Article  12  

The members of the armed forces and other persons mentioned in the following Article, who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that term “shipwreck” means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments; they shall not wilfully be left without medical assistance and care, nor shall conditions exposing them to contagion or infection be created. Only urgent medical reasons will authorize priority in the order of treatment to be administered. Women shall be treated with all consideration due to their sex.  

### Article  13  

The present Convention shall apply to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked at sea belonging to the following categories: 

(1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.  

(2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions: 

(a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;  

(b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;  

(c) that of carrying arms openly;  

(d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.    

(3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a Government or an authority not recognised by the Detaining Power.  

(4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany.  

(5) Members of crews including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.  

(6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.    

### Article  14  

All warships of a belligerent Party shall have the right to demand that the wounded, sick or shipwrecked on board military hospital ships, and hospital ships belonging to relief societies or to private individuals, as well as merchant vessels, yachts and other craft shall be surrendered, whatever their nationality, provided that the wounded and sick are in a fit state to be moved and that the warship can provide adequate facilities for necessary medical treatment.  

### Article  15  

If wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons are taken on board a neutral warship or a neutral military aircraft, it shall be ensured, where so required by international law, that they can take no further part in operations of war.  

### Article  16  

Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the wounded, sick and shipwrecked of a belligerent who fall into enemy hands shall be prisoners of war, and the provisions of international law concerning prisoners of war shall apply to them. The captor may decide, according to circumstances, whether it is expedient to hold them, or to convey them to a port in the captor's own country, to a neutral port or even to a port in enemy territory. In the last case, prisoners of war thus returned to their home country may not serve for the duration of the war.  

### Article  17  

Wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons who are landed in neutral ports with the consent of the local authorities, shall, failing arrangements to the contrary between the neutral and the belligerent Powers, be so guarded by the neutral Power, where so required by international law, that the said persons cannot again take part in operations of war. The costs of hospital accommodation and internment shall be borne by the Power on whom the wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons depend.  

### Article  18  

After each engagement, Parties to the conflict shall, without delay, take all possible measures to search for and collect the shipwrecked, wounded and sick, to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment, to ensure their adequate care, and to search for the dead and prevent their being despoiled. Whenever circumstances permit, the Parties to the conflict shall conclude local arrangements for the removal of the wounded and sick by sea from a besieged or encircled area and for the passage of medical and religious personnel and equipment on their way to that area.  

### Article  19  

The Parties to the conflict shall record as soon as possible, in respect of each shipwrecked, wounded, sick or dead person of the adverse Party falling into their hands, any particulars which may assist in his identification. These records should if possible include: 

(a) designation of the Power on which he depends;  

(b) army, regimental, personal or serial number;  

(c) surname;  

(d) first name or names;  

(e) date of birth;  

(f) any other particulars shown on his identity card or disc;  

(g) date and place of capture or death;  

(h) particulars concerning wounds or illness, or cause of death.   As soon as possible the above-mentioned information shall be forwarded to the information bureau described in Article 122 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, which shall transmit this information to the Power on which these persons depend through the intermediary of the Protecting Power and of the Central Prisoners of War Agency. Parties to the conflict shall prepare and forward to each other through the same bureau, certificates of death or duly authenticated lists of the dead. They shall likewise collect and forward through the same bureau one half of the double identity disc, or the identity disc itself if it is a single disc, last wills or other documents of importance to the next of kin, money and in general all articles of an intrinsic or sentimental value, which are found on the dead. These articles, together with unidentified articles, shall be sent in sealed packets, accompanied by statements giving all particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased owners, as well as by a complete list of the contents of the parcel.  

### Article  20  

Parties to the conflict shall ensure that burial at sea of the dead, carried out individually as far as circumstances permit, is preceded by a careful examination, if possible by a medical examination, of the bodies, with a view to confirming death, establishing identity and enabling a report to be made. Where a double identity disc is used, one half of the disc should remain on the body. If dead persons are landed, the provisons of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, shall be applicable.  

### Article  21  

The Parties to the conflict may appeal to the charity of commanders of neutral merchant vessels, yachts or other craft, to take on board and care for wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons, and to collect the dead. Vessels of any kind responding to this appeal, and those having of their own accord collected wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons, shall enjoy special protection and facilities to carry out such assistance. They may, in no case, be captured on account of any such transport; but, in the absence of any promise to the contrary, they shall remain liable to capture for any violations of neutrality they may have committed.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####HOSPITAL SHIPS

### Article  22  

Military hospital ships, that is to say, ships built or equipped by the Powers specially and solely with a view to assisting the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, to treating them and to transporting them, may in no circumstances be attacked or captured, but shall at all times be respected and protected, on condition that their names and descriptions have been notified to the Parties to the conflict ten days before those ships are employed. The characteristics which must appear in the notification shall include registered gross tonnage, the length from stem to stern and the number of masts and funnels.  

### Article  23  

Establishments ashore entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, shall be protected from bombardment or attack from the sea.  

### Article  24  

Hospital ships utilized by National Red Cross Societies, by officially recognized relief societies or by private persons shall have the same protection as military hospital ships and shall be exempt from capture, if the Party to the conflict on which they depend has given them an official commission and in so far as the provisions of Article 22 concerning notification have been complied with. These ships must be provided with certificates from the responsible authorities, stating that the vessels have been under their control while fitting out and on departure.  

### Article  25  

Hospital ships utilized by National Red Cross Societies, officially recognized relief societies, or private persons of neutral countries shall have the same protection as military hospital ships and shall be exempt from capture, on condition that they have placed themselves under the control of one of the Parties to the conflict, with the previous consent of their own governments and with the authorization of the Party to the conflict concerned, in so far as the provisions of Article 22 concerning notification have been complied with.  

### Article  26  

The protection mentioned in Articles 22, 24 and 25 shall apply to hospital ships of any tonnage and to their lifeboats, wherever they are operating. Nevertheless, to ensure the maximum comfort and security, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to utilize, for the transport of wounded, sick and shipwrecked over long distances and on the high seas, only hospital ships of over 2,000 tons gross.  

### Article  27  

Under the same conditions as those provided for in Articles 22 and 24, small craft employed by the State or by the officially recognized lifeboat institutions for coastal rescue operations, shall also he respected and protected, so far as operational requirements permit. The same shall apply so far as possible to fixed coastal installations used exclusively by these craft for their humanitarian missions.  

### Article  28  

Should fighting occur on board a warship, the sick-bays shall be respected and spared as far as possible. Sick-bays and their equipment shall remain subject to the laws of warfare, but may not be diverted from their purpose so long als they are required for the wounded and sick. Nevertheless, the commander into whose power they have fallen may, after ensuring the proper care of the wounded and sick who are accommodated therein, apply them to other purposes in case of urgent military necessity.  

### Article  29  

Any hospital ship in a port which falls into the hands of the enemy shall be authorized to leave the said port.  

### Article  30  

The vessels described in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 shall afford relief and assistance to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked without distinction of nationality. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to use these vessels for any military purpose. Such vessels shall in no wise hamper the movements of the combatants. During and after an engagement, they will act at their own risk.  

### Article  31  

The Parties to the conflict shall have the right to control and search the vessels mentioned in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27. They can refuse assistance from these vessels, order them off, make them take a certain course, control the use of their wireless and other means of communication, and even detain them for a period not exceeding seven days from the time of interception, if the gravity of the circumstances so requires. They may put a commissioner temporarily on board whose sole task shall be to see that orders given in virtue of the provisions of the preceding paragraph are carried out. As far as possible, the Parties to the conflict shall enter in the log of the hospital ship, in a language he can understand, the orders they have given the captain of the vessel. Parties to the conflict may, either unilaterally or by particular agreements, put on board their ships neutral observers who shall verify the strict observation of the provisions contained in the present Convention.  

### Article  32  

Vessels described in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 are not classed as warships as regards their stay in a neutral port.  

### Article  33  

Merchant vessels which have been transformed into hospital ships cannot be put to any other use throughout the duration of hostilities.  

### Article  34  

The protection to which hospital ships and sick-bays are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning has been given, naming in all appropriate cases a reasonable time limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded. In particular, hospital ships may not possess or use a secret code for their wireless or other means of communication.  

### Article  35  

The following conditions shall not be considered as depriving hospital ships or sick-bays of vessels of the protection due to them: 

(1) The fact that the crews of ships or sick-bays are armed for the maintenance of order, for their own defence or that of the sick and wounded.  

(2) The presence on board of apparatus exclusively intended to facilitate navigation or communication.  

(3) The discovery on board hospital ships or in sick-bays of portable arms and ammunition taken from the wounded, sick and shipwrecked and not yet handed to the proper service.  

(4) The fact that the humanitarian activities of hospital ships and sick-bays of vessels or of the crews extend to the care of wounded, sick or shipwrecked civilians.  

(5) The transport of equipment and of personnel intended exclusively for medical duties, over and above the normal requirements.    

### CHAPTER  IV  

####PERSONNEL

### Article  36  

The religious, medical and hospital personnel of hospital ships and their crews shall be respected and protected; they may not be captured during the time they are in the service of the hospital ship, whether or not there are wounded and sick on board.  

### Article  37  

The religious, medical and hospital personnel assigned to the medical or spiritual care of the persons designated in Articles 12 and 13 shall, if they fall into the hands of the enemy, be respected and protected; they may continue to carry out their duties as long as this is necessary for the care of the wounded and sick. They shall afterwards be sent back as soon as the Commander-in-Chief, under whose authority they are, considers it practicable. They may take with them, on leaving the ship, their personal property. If, however, it prove necessary to retain some of this personnel owing to the medical or spiritual needs of prisoners of war, everything possible shall be done for their earliest possible landing. Retained personnel shall be subject, on landing, to the provisions of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####MEDICAL TRANSPORTS

### Article  38  

Ships chartered for that purpose shall be authorized to transport equipment exclusively intended for the treatment of wounded and sick members of armed forces or for the prevention of disease, provided that the particulars regarding their voyage have been notified to the adverse Power and approved by the latter. The adverse Power shall preserve the right to board the carrier ships, but not to capture them or seize the equipment carried. By agreement amongst the Parties to the conflict, neutral observers may be placed on board such ships to verify the equipment carried. For this purpose, free access to the equipment shall be given.  

### Article  39  

Medical aircraft, that is to say, aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, and for the transport of medical personnel and equipment, may not be the object of attack, but shall be respected by the Parties to the conflict, while flying at heights, at times and on routes specifically agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict concerned. They shall be clearly marked with the distinctive emblem prescribed in Article 41, together with their national colours, on their lower, upper and lateral surfaces. They shall be provided with any other markings or means of identification which may be agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict upon the outbreak or during the course of hostilities. Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are prohibited. Medical aircraft shall obey every summons to alight on land or water. In the event of having thus to alight, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its flight after examination, if any. In the event of alighting involuntarily on land or water in enemy or enemy-occupied territory, the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, as well as the crew of the aircraft shall be prisoners of war. The medical personnel shall be treated according to Articles 36 and 37.  

### Article  40  

Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph, medical aircraft of Parties to the conflict may fly over the territory of neutral Powers, land thereon in case of necessity, or use it as a port of call. They shall give neutral Powers prior notice of their passage over the said territory, and obey every summons to alight, on land or water. They will be immune from attack only when flying on routes, at heights and at times specifically agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict and the neutral Power concerned. The neutral Powers may, however, place conditions or restrictions on the passage or landing of medical aircraft on their territory. Such possible conditions or restrictions shall be applied equally to all Parties to the conflict. Unless otherwise agreed between the neutral Powers and the Parties to the conflict, the wounded, sick or shipwrecked who are disembarked with the consent of the local authorities on neutral territory by medical aircraft shall be detained by the neutral Power, where so required by international law, in such a manner that they cannot again take part in operations of war. The cost of their accommodation and internment shall be borne by the Power on which they depend.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####THE DISTINCTIVE EMBLEM

### Article  41  

Under the direction of the competent military authority, the emblem of the red cross on a white ground shall be displayed on the flags, armlets and on all equipment employed in the Medical Service. Nevertheless, in the case of countries which already use as emblem, in place of the red cross, the red crescent or the red lion and sun on a white ground, these emblems are also recognized by the terms of the present Convention.  

### Article  42  

The personnel designated in Articles 36 and 37 shall wear, affixed to the left arm, a water-resistant armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and stamped by the military authority. Such personnel, in addition te wearing the identity disc mentioned in Article 19, shall also carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card shall be water-resistant and of such size that it can be carried in the pocket. It shall be worded in the national language, shall mention at least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the rank and the service number of the bearer, and shall state in what capacity he is entitled to the protection of the present Convention. The card shall bear the photograph of the owner and also either his signature or his fingerprints or both. It shall be embossed with the stamp of the military authority. The identity card shall be uniform throughout the same armed forces and, as far as possible, of a similar type in the armed forces of the High Contracting Parties. The Parties to the conflict may be guided by the model which is annexed, by way of example, to the present Convention. They shall inform each other, at the outbreak of hostilities, of the model they are using. Identity cards should be made out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by the home country. In no circumstances may the said personnel be deprived of their insignia or identity cards nor of the right to wear the armlet. In case of loss they shall be entitled to receive duplicates of the cards and to have the insignia replaced.  

### Article  43  

The ships designated in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 shall be distinctively marked as follows: 

(a) All exterior surfaces shall be white.  

(b) One or more dark red crosses, as large as possible, shall be painted and displayed on each side of the hull and on the horizontal surfaces, so placed as to afford the greatest possible visibility from the sea and from the air.   All hospital ships shall make themselves known by hoisting their national flag and further, if they belong to a neutral state, the flag of the Party to the conflict whose direction they have accepted. A white flag with a red cross shall be flown at the mainmast as high as possible. Lifeboats of hospital ships, coastal lifeboats and all small craft used by the Medical Service shall be painted white with dark red crosses prominently displayed and shall, in general, comply with the identification system prescribed above for hospital ships. The above-mentioned ships and craft, which may wish to ensure by night and in times of reduced visibility the protection to which they are entitled, must, subject to the assent of the Party to the conflic under whose power they are, take the necessary measures to render their painting and distinctive emblems sufficiently apparent. Hospital ships which, in accordance with Article 31, are provisionally detained by the enemy, must haul down the flag of the Party to the conflict in whose service they are or whose direction they have accepted. Coastal lifeboats, if they continue to operate with the consent of the Occupying Power from a base which is occupied, may be allowed, when away from their base, to continue to fly their own national colours along with a flag carrying a red cross on a white ground, subject to prior notification to all the Parties to the conflict concerned. All the provisions in this Article relating to the red cross shall apply equally to the other emblems mentioned in Article 41. Parties to the conflict shall at all times endeavour to conclude mutual agreements in order to use the most modern methods available to facilitate the identification of hospital ships.  

### Article  44  

The distinguishing signs referred to in Article 43 can only be used, whether in time of peace or wars for indicating or protecting the ships therein mentioned, except as may be provided in any other international Convention or by agreement between all the Parties to the conflict concerned.  

### Article  45  

The High Contracting Parties shall, if their legislation is not already adequate, take the measures necessary for the prevention and repression, at all times, of any abuse of the distinctive signs provided for under Article 43.  

### CHAPTER  VII  

####EXECUTION OF THE CONVENTION

### Article  46  

Each Party to the conflict, acting through its Commanders-in-Chief, shall ensure the detailed execution of the preceding Articles and provide for unforeseen cases, in conformity with the general principles of the present Convention.  

### Article  47  

Reprisals against the wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, the personnel, the vessels or the equipment protected by the Convention are prohibited.  

### Article  48  

The High Contracting Parties undertake, in time of peace as in time of war, to disseminate the text of the present Convention as widely as possible in their respective countries, and, in particular, to include the study thereof in their programmes of military and, if possible, civil instruction, so that the principles thereof may become known to the entire population, in particular to the armed fighting forces, the medical personnel and the chaplains.  

### Article  49  

The High Contracting Parties shall communicate to one another through the Swiss Federal Council and, during hostilities, through the Protecting Powers, the official translations of the present Convention, as well as the laws and regulations which they may adopt to ensure the application thereof.  

### CHAPTER  VIII  

####REPRESSION OF ABUSES AND INFRACTIONS

### Article  50  

The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordening to be committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in the following Article. Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a *prima facie* case. Each High Contracting Party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other than the grave breaches defined in the following Article. In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided by Article 105 and those following of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949.  

### Article  51  

Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.  

### Article  52  

No High Contracting Party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other High Contracting Party of any liability incurred by itself or by another High Contracting Parly in respect of breaches referred to in the preceding Article.

####Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen van de strijdkrachten ter zee, van 12 Augustus 1949

De ondergetekenden, Gevolmachtigden van de Regeringen, vertegenwoordigd op de Diplomatieke Conferentie welke te Genève van 21 April tot 12 Augustus 1949 is bijeengekomen tot herziening van het Tiende Haagse Verdrag van 18 October 1907 voor de toepassing op den zeeoorlog der beginselen van het Verdrag van Genève van 1906, zijn het volgende overeengekomen:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  1  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich dit Verdrag onder alle omstandigheden te eerbiedigen en te doen eerbiedigen.  

### Artikel  2  

Onverminderd de bepalingen welke reeds in tijd van vrede in werking moeten treden, is dit Verdrag van toepassing ingeval een oorlog is verklaard of bij ieder ander gewapend conflict dat ontstaat tussen twee of meer der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, zelfs indien de oorlogstoestand door één der Partijen niet wordt erkend. Het Verdrag is eveneens van toepassing in alle gevallen van gehele of gedeeltelijke bezetting van het grondgebied van een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, zelfs indien deze bezetting geen gewapende tegenstand ontmoet. Indien één der in conflict zijnde Mogendheden geen partij is bij dit Verdrag, blijven de Mogendheden die wel partij zijn, niettemin in haar onderlinge betrekkingen hierdoor gebonden. Bovendien zullen zij door het Verdrag gebonden zijn ten opzichte van bedoelde Mogendheid, indien deze de bepalingen daarvan aanvaardt en toepast.  

### Artikel  3  

In geval van een gewapend conflict op het grondgebied van één der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, hetwelk geen internationaal karakter draagt, is ieder der Partijen bij het conflict gehouden ten minste de volgende bepalingen toe te passen: 

1. Personen die niet rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deelnemen, met inbegrip van personeel van strijdkrachten dat de wapens heeft nedergelegd, en zij die buiten gevecht zijn gesteld door ziekte, verwonding, gevangenschap of enige andere oorzaak, moeten onder alle omstandigheden menslievend worden behandeld, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond op ras, huidkleur, godsdienst of geloof, geslacht, geboorte of maatschappelijke welstand of enig ander soortgelijk criterium. Te dien einde zijn en blijven te allen tijde en overal ten aanzien van bovengenoemde personen verboden: 

a. aanslag op het leven en lichamelijke geweldpleging, in het bijzonder het doden op welke wijze ook, verminking, wrede behandeling en marteling;  

b. het nemen van gijzelaars;  

c. aanranding van de persoonlijke waardigheid, in het bijzonder vernederende en onterende behandeling;  

d. het uitspreken en tenuitvoerleggen van vonnissen zonder voorafgaande berechting door een op regelmatige wijze samengesteld gerecht dat alle gerechtelijke waarborgen biedt, door de beschaafde volken als onmisbaar erkend.    

2. De gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen moeten worden verzameld en verzorgd. Een onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, kan haar diensten aan de Partijen bij het conflict aanbieden.   De Partijen bij het conflict zullen er verder naar streven door middel van bijzondere overeenkomsten de andere of een deel der andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag van kracht te doen worden. De toepassing van bovenstaande bepalingen zal niet van invloed zijn op de juridische status van de Partijen bij het conflict.  

### Artikel  4  

In geval van oorlogshandelingen tussen land- en zeestrijdkrachten van de Partijen bij het conflict, zijn de bepalingen van dit Verdrag slechts op ingescheepte strijdkrachten van toepassing. Ontscheepte strijdkrachten zijn onmiddellijk onderworpen aan de bepalingen van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  5  

Onzijdige Mogendheden zullen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag op overeenkomstige wijze toepassen op gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, op leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, die behoren tot de strijdkrachten van Partijen bij het conflict en die op haar grondgebied worden toegelaten of geïnterneerd, evenals op de gevonden doden.  

### Artikel  6  

Onverminderd de overeenkomsten, uitdrukkelijk voorzien in de artikelen 10, 18, 31, 38, 39, 40, 43 en 53, kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen andere bijzondere overeenkomsten sluiten betreffende alle aangelegenheden waarvoor zij afzonderlijke regelingen wenselijk achten. Geen bijzondere overeenkomst mag de positie van gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, van leden van het geneeskundig personeel of van geestelijken, zoals in dit Verdrag geregeld, ongunstig beïnvloeden, noch de rechten welke dit hun toekent, beperken. Gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, evenals leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, zullen de voordelen van zodanige overeenkomsten blijven genieten zolang het Verdrag op hen van toepassing is, tenzij uitdrukkelijk het tegendeel is bepaald in bovenbedoelde of nadien gesloten overeenkomsten, dan wel gunstiger maatregelen door één der Partijen bij het conflict ten aanzien van hen zijn genomen.  

### Artikel  7  

Gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, evenals leden van het geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, mogen onder geen enkele omstandigheid geheel of gedeeltelijk afstand doen van de rechten welke dit Verdrag en eventueel de bijzondere overeenkomsten, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, hun waarborgen.  

### Artikel  8  

Dit Verdrag zal worden toegepast met de medewerking en onder het toezicht van de beschermende Mogendheden die belast zijn met het behartigen van de belangen van de Partijen bij het conflict. Te dien einde kunnen de beschermende Mogendheden, naast haar diplomatiek of consulair personeel, gedelegeerden benoemen uit haar eigen onderdanen of uit die van andere onzijdige Mogendheden. De benoeming van deze gedelegeerden moet worden onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de Mogendheid bij welke zij hun taak zullen vervullen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zo veel mogelijk de taak van de vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden vergemakkelijken. De vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden mogen in geen geval de grenzen van de hun krachtens dit Verdrag opgedragen taak overschrijden; zij moeten in het bijzonder rekening houden met de gebiedende eisen van veiligheid van de Staat bij welke zij hun taak vervullen. Slechts bij uitzondering kunnen hun werkzaamheden tijdelijk worden beperkt wegens dwingende militaire noodzaak.  

### Artikel  9  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag vormen geen belemmering voor de menslievende werkzaamheden welke, met toestemming van de betrokken Partijen bij het conflict, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie op zich neemt voor de bescherming van gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, alsmede voor aan hen te verlenen hulp.  

### Artikel  10  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen te allen tijde overeenkomen de taak welke krachtens dit Verdrag op de beschermende Mogendheden rust, toe te vertrouwen aan een organisatie die alle waarborgen van onpartijdigheid en doeltreffendheid biedt. Indien gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, of geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, om welke reden ook, niet of niet meer de voordelen genieten van de werkzaamheden van een beschermende Mogendheid of van een organisatie, aangewezen overeenkomstig het eerste lid, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een onzijdige Staat of een organisatie, als bovenbedoeld, verzoeken de taak op zich te nemen, welke krachtens dit Verdrag rust op door de Partijen bij het conflict aangewezen beschermende Mogendheden. Indien op deze wijze niet in de bescherming kan worden voorzien, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, verzoeken de menslievende taak, anders krachtens dit Verdrag door beschermende Mogendheden uitgeoefend, op zich te nemen, dan wel, behoudens de bepalingen van dit artikel, het aanbod van de diensten door een zodanige organisatie aanvaarden. Iedere onzijdige Mogendheid of iedere organisatie die door de belanghebbende Mogendheid wordt aangezocht dan wel zich met het bovenbedoeld oogmerk aanbiedt, moet zich bij haar optreden bewust blijven van haar verantwoordelijkheid ten opzichte van de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke de door dit Verdrag beschermde personen behoren, en moet voldoende waarborgen bieden, dat zij in staat is de betreffende taak op zich te nemen en deze op onpartijdige wijze uit te voeren. Van de voorgaande bepalingen mag niet worden afgeweken bij bijzondere overeenkomst tussen Mogendheden van welke zich één ten gevolge van het verloop der krijgsverrichtingen, zelfs tijdelijk, ten opzichte van de andere Mogendheid of haar bondgenoten in haar vrijheid van onderhandelen beperkt ziet, in het bijzonder ingeval het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Mogendheid, of een belangrijk gedeelte daarvan, is bezet. Waar in dit Verdrag wordt gesproken van een beschermende Mogendheid, wordt daaronder begrepen een vervangende organisatie in de zin van dit artikel.  

### Artikel  11  

In alle gevallen waarin zij zulks in het belang van de beschermde personen raadzaam achten, in het bijzonder bij meningsverschil tussen de Partijen bij het conflict over de toepassing of uitlegging van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, zullen de beschermende Mogendheden haar goede diensten verlenen tot oplossing van het geschil. Te dien einde kan ieder der beschermende Mogendheden, op uitnodiging van één Partij of op eigen initiatief, aan de Partijen bij het conflict een bijeenkomst voorstellen van haar vertegenwoordigers, in het bijzonder van de autoriteiten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken, eventueel op passend gekozen onzijdig gebied. De Partijen bij het conflict zijn gehouden gevolg te geven aan de voorstellen welke haar tot dit doel worden gedaan. De beschermende Mogendheden kunnen, zo nodig, de Partijen bij het conflict voorstellen de benoeming van een bepaald persoon, behorend tot een onzijdige Mogendheid of afgevaardigd door het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, die zal worden uitgenodigd aan een zodanige bijeenkomst deel te nemen, goed te keuren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Van de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen

### Artikel  12  

De leden van de gewapende macht en andere personen, genoemd in het volgend artikel, die zich op zee bevinden en die gewond, ziek of schipbreukelingen zijn, moeten onder alle omstandigheden worden ontzien en beschermd, met dien verstande, dat onder „schipbreuk” wordt verstaan iedere schipbreuk, waardoor ook veroorzaakt, een gedwongen landing op zee van of uit een vliegtuig inbegrepen. Zij moeten menslievend worden behandeld en verzorgd door de Partij bij het conflict, die hen in haar macht heeft, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond op geslacht, ras, nationaliteit, godsdienst, politieke overtuiging of enig ander soortgelijk criterium. Iedere aanslag op het leven en de persoon is streng verboden; in het bijzonder mogen zij niet worden afgemaakt of uitgeroeid, noch worden onderworpen aan martelingen of biologische proefnemingen; zij mogen niet opzettelijk zonder geneeskundige hulp of verzorging worden gelaten, noch mogen omstandigheden worden geschapen, waardoor zij aan besmetting of infectie worden blootgesteld. Slechts op grond van medische noodzaak is voorrang in behandeling toegestaan. Vrouwen moeten met alle aan haar sekse verschuldigde voorkomendheid worden behandeld.  

### Artikel  13  

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, die behoren tot de volgende categorieën: 

1. leden van de gewapende macht van een Partij bij het conflict, alsmede leden van de militiën en vrijwilligers-korpsen welke deel uitmaken van deze gewapende macht;  

2. leden van andere militiën en leden van andere vrijwilligerskorpsen, met inbegrip van die van georganiseerde verzetsgroepen, behorend tot een Partij bij het conflict en optredend binnen of buiten het eigen grondgebied, zelfs indien dit grondgebied is bezet, mits deze militiën of vrijwilligers-korpsen, de georganiseerde verzetsgroepen inbegrepen, voldoen aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. onder bevel te staan van een persoon die verantwoordelijk is voor zijn ondergeschikten;  

b. een vast en op enige afstand herkenbaar onderscheidingsteken te hebben;  

c. de wapens openlijk te dragen;  

d. zich in hun handelingen te gedragen naar de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog;    

3. leden van de geregelde strijdkrachten die er zich op beroepen in dienst te staan van een regering of van een autoriteit die niet worden erkend door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid;  

4. personen die de gewapende macht volgen zonder daarvan rechtstreeks deel uit te maken, zoals burger leden van bemanningen van militaire luchtvaartuigen, oorlogscorrespondenten, leveranciers, leden van werkeenheden of van diensten, belast met de verzorging van het welzijn der militairen, mits zij daartoe machtiging hebben ontvangen van de strijdmacht welke zij begeleiden;  

5. leden van de bemanningen van de koopvaardijvloot, met inbegrip van gezagvoerders, stuurlieden en leerlingen, en de bemanningen van de burgerluchtvaartuigen van de Partijen bij het conflict, die niet een gunstiger behandeling op grond van andere bepalingen van het internationale recht genieten;  

6. de bevolking van een niet-bezet gebied die, bij het naderen van de vijand, uit eigen beweging de wapens opneemt om de invallende troepen te bestrijden, zonder tijd gehad te hebben zich tot geregelde gewapende eenheden te organiseren, mits zij de wapens openlijk draagt en de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog eerbiedigt.    

### Artikel  14  

Ieder oorlogsschip van een oorlogvoerende Partij kan de uitlevering eisen van de gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen die aan boord zijn van militaire hospitaalschepen, van hospitaalschepen, toebehorend aan verenigingen tot hulpverlening of aan particulieren, van handelsvaartuigen, jachten en andere kleine vaartuigen, ongeacht hun nationaliteit, mits de toestand van de gewonden en zieken dit vervoer toelaat en het oorlogsschip zodanig is uitgerust, dat een behoorlijke geneeskundige verzorging is gewaarborgd.  

### Artikel  15  

Indien gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen aan boord van een onzijdig oorlogsschip of van een onzijdig militair vliegtuig worden opgenomen, moeten, in de gevallen waarin het internationale recht zulks voorschrijft, maatregelen worden genomen, opdat zij niet opnieuw aan de krijgsverrichtingen kunnen deelnemen.  

### Artikel  16  

Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 12, zullen de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen van een oorlogvoerende, die in handen van de vijand vallen, krijgsgevangenen zijn en zullen de regelen van het volkenrecht betreffende krijgsgevangenen op hen van toepassing zijn. Aan degeen, die hen gevangen neemt, staat het vrij, naar gelang der omstandigheden, te beslissen of het dienstig is hen aan boord te houden of hen naar een haven van zijn eigen land, naar een onzijdige haven of zelfs naar een haven van de tegenpartij te zenden. In het laatste geval mogen de aldus naar hun land teruggezonden krijgsgevangenen niet dienen voor de duur van de oorlog.  

### Artikel  17  

Gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen die, met toestemming van de plaatselijke autoriteiten, in een onzijdige haven worden ontscheept, moeten, behoudens indien tussen de onzijdige Mogendheid en de oorlogvoerende Mogendheden anders is overeengekomen, in de gevallen waarin het internationale recht zulks voorschrijft, op zodanige wijze door de onzijdige Mogendheid worden bewaakt, dat zij niet opnieuw aan de krijgsverrichtingen kunnen deelnemen. De hospitaal- en interneringskosten zullen worden gedragen door de Mogendheid tot welke de gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen behoren.  

### Artikel  18  

Na ieder gevecht zullen de Partijen bij het conflict onverwijld alle mogelijke maatregelen nemen om de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen op te zoeken en aan boord te nemen, hen tegen plundering en slechte behandeling te beschermen en hun de nodige verzorging te verzekeren, zomede om de doden op te zoeken en te voorkomen, dat deze worden beroofd. Telkens wanneer de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict plaatselijke regelingen treffen voor de evacuatie over zee van gewonden en zieken uit een belegerd of omsingeld gebied en voor het doorlaten van geneeskundig personeel en geestelijken en van geneeskundig materieel, bestemd voor dit gebied.  

### Artikel  19  

De Partijen bij het conflict moeten binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd alle gegevens registreren welke van nut kunnen zijn om de in haar handen gevallen schipbreukelingen, gewonden, zieken en doden van de tegenpartij te identificeren. Deze gegevens zullen zo mogelijk bevatten: 

a. aanduiding van de Mogendheid tot welke zij behoren;  

b. leger-, stamboek- of ander contrôlenummer;  

c. geslachtsnaam;  

d. voornaam of voornamen;  

e. geboortedatum;  

f. alle andere gegevens welke op de identiteitskaart of het identiteitsplaatje voorkomen;  

g. datum en plaats van gevangenneming of overlijden;  

h. gegevens betreffende verwondingen, ziekte of doodsoorzaak.   Zo spoedig mogelijk moeten bovengenoemde gegevens worden toegezonden aan het Informatiebureau, bedoeld in artikel 122 van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949, welk Bureau deze inlichtingen door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheid en het Centraal Bureau voor Krijgsgevangenen zal doorgeven aan de Mogendheid tot welke de betrokken personen behoren. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen overlijdensakten of behoorlijk gewaarmerkte lijsten van overledenen opmaken en deze elkander langs de in het voorgaand lid aangegeven weg doen toekomen. Evenzo zullen zij verzamelen de helft van het tweedelige identiteitsplaatje, of het enkelvoudig identiteitsplaatje in zijn geheel, testamenten of andere bescheiden van waarde voor de familie der overledenen, geld en in het algemeen alle op de doden gevonden voorwerpen welke een wezenlijke dan wel een gevoelswaarde hebben, en deze elkander door tussenkomst van hetzelfde Bureau doen toekomen. Deze voorwerpen, alsmede niet-geïdentificeerde voorwerpen, zullen worden verzonden in vergezegelde pakketten, vergezeld van een verklaring, houdende alle bijzonderheden, nodig voor de identificatie van de overleden bezitter, benevens van een volledige inhoudsopgave van het pakket.  

### Artikel  20  

De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zorg dragen, dat het overboord zetten van doden, hetgeen voor iedere overledene afzonderlijk zal plaatsvinden voor zover de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, wordt voorafgegaan door een nauwkeurig en, zo mogelijk, geneeskundig onderzoek van het lichaam, ten einde de dood en de identiteit vast te stellen en het opstellen van een verslag mogelijk te maken. Indien een tweedelig identiteitsplaatje wordt gebruikt, zal de helft daarvan aan het lijk bevestigd blijven. Indien doden aan land worden gezet, zijn de bepalingen van toepassing van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  21  

De Partijen bij het conflict kunnen een beroep doen op de menslievendheid der gezagvoerders van onzijdige handelsvaartuigen, jachten of andere kleine vaartuigen, om gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen aan boord te nemen, hen te verzorgen en de doden op te nemen. De vaartuigen van welke soort ook, welke aan dit beroep gehoor hebben gegeven, evenals die welke uit eigen beweging gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen aan boord hebben genomen, zullen bijzondere bescherming alsmede faciliteiten genieten, ten einde deze hulp te kunnen verlenen. In geen geval mogen zij wegens het feit van dit vervoer worden prijsgemaakt; maar zij blijven, tenzij hun beloften in tegengestelde zin zijn gedaan, blootgesteld aan prijsmaking wegens enige schending der onzijdigheid, waaraan zij zich mochten hebben schuldig gemaakt.  

### HOOFSTUK  III  

####Van de hospitaalschepen

### Artikel  22  

Militaire hospitaalschepen, waaronder te verstaan schepen, door de Mogendheden gebouwd of ingericht in het bijzonder en uitsluitend met het doel om hulp te verlenen aan gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, hen te behandelen en te vervoeren, mogen onder geen omstandigheid aangevallen of prijs gemaakt worden, maar moeten te allen tijde worden ontzien en beschermd, mits hun namen en kenmerken tien dagen vóór ingebruikstelling ter kennis van de Partijen bij het conflict zijn gebracht. De kenmerken welke deze kennisgeving ten minste moet bevatten, zijn de bruto registertonnage, de lengte van boeg tot achtersteven en het aantal masten en schoorstenen.  

### Artikel  23  

Walinrichtingen welke de bescherming van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949 genieten, mogen niet van zee uit worden aangevallen of gebombardeerd.  

### Artikel  24  

Hospitaalschepen, gebruikt door nationale Rode Kruis Verenigingen, door officieel erkende verenigingen tot hulpverlening of door particulieren, genieten dezelfde bescherming als militaire hospitaalschepen en zijn niet onderhevig aan prijsmaking, indien de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke zij behoren, hun een officiële opdracht heeft gegeven en voor zover de bepalingen van artikel 22 betreffende de kennisgeving in acht zijn genomen. Deze schepen moeten voorzien zijn van een document, afkomstig van de bevoegde autoriteit, verklarende, dat zij gedurende hun uitrusting en bij hun vertrek aan haar toezicht onderworpen zijn geweest.  

### Artikel  25  

Hospitaalschepen, gebruikt door nationale Rode Kruis Verenigingen, door officieel erkende verenigingen tot hulpverlening of door particulieren van onzijdige landen, genieten dezelfde bescherming als militaire hospitaalschepen en zijn niet onderhevig aan prijsmaking, mits zij zich onder leiding van één der Partijen bij het conflict hebben gesteld, met voorafgaande goedkeuring van hun eigen Regering en met machtiging van de betrokken Partij bij het conflict en voor zover de bepalingen van artikel 22 betreffende de kennisgeving in acht zijn genomen.  

### Artikel  26  

De bescherming krachtens de artikelen 22, 24 en 25 is van toepassing op hospitaalschepen van iedere tonnenmaat en op hun reddingboten, waar zij zich ook bevinden. Niettemin zullen de Partijen bij het conflict, ten einde een maximum aan comfort en veiligheid te verzekeren, er naar streven voor het transport van gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen over lange afstanden en in volle zee, slechts hospitaalschepen te gebruiken groter dan 2000 ton bruto.  

### Artikel  27  

Onder dezelfde voorwaarden als genoemd in de artikelen 22 en 24, moeten kleine vaartuigen, in gebruik bij de Staat of bij officieel erkende kust-reddingmaatschappijen, eveneens worden ontzien en beschermd, voor zover de militaire operaties zulks veroorloven. Hetzelfde geldt, voor zover mogelijk, voor de vaste kustinstallaties welke uitsluitend door deze vaartuigen voor hun menslievende taak worden gebruikt.  

### Artikel  28  

In geval van een gevecht aan boord van een oorlogsschip, moeten de ziekenboegen zoveel mogelijk worden ontzien en gespaard. Deze ziekenboegen en hun materieel blijven aan de oorlogswetten onderworpen, maar mogen niet aan hun bestemming worden onttrokken zolang zij voor de gewonden en zieken nodig zijn. Evenwel zal de commandant die hen in zijn macht heeft, de bevoegdheid hebben daarover, in geval van dwingende militaire noodzaak, te beschikken, mits hij tevoren de verzorging van de daarin verpleegde gewonden en zieken heeft veilig gesteld.  

### Artikel  29  

Ieder hospitaalschip in een haven welke in handen van de vijand valt, beseft het recht deze haven te verlaten.  

### Artikel  30  

De vaartuigen, genoemd in de artikelen 22, 24, 25, en 27, zullen hulp en bijstand verlenen aan gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, ongeacht hun nationaliteit. De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich deze vaartuigen niet voor enig militair doel te gebruiken. Deze vaartuigen mogen op generlei wijze de strijdenden in hun bewegingen hinderen. Gedurende en na een gevecht handelen zij op eigen risico.  

### Artikel  31  

De Partijen bij het conflict hebben het recht van toezicht op en van doorzoeking van de vaartuigen, bedoeld in de artikelen 22, 24, 25 en 27. Zij kunnen de medewerking van deze vaartuigen weigeren, hun gebieden zich te verwijderen, hun een bepaalde koers voorschrijven, het gebruik van hun draadloze telegrafie of andere verbindingsmiddelen regelen en hen zelfs vasthouden voor een tijdvak van niet langer dan zeven dagen, gerekend van het ogenblik van aanhouding, indien de ernst der omstandigheden zulks mocht vereisen. Zij kunnen tijdelijk een commissaris aan boord plaatsen, wiens enige laak zal zijn toe te zien, dat de krachtens de bepalingen van het voorgaand lid gegeven bevelen worden uitgevoerd. Voor zover mogelijk, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict de bevelen welke zij aan de kapitein van het schip hebben gegeven, in een voor hem begrijpelijke taal in het journaal van het hospitaalschip inschrijven. De Partijen bij het conflict kunnen, hetzij uit eigen beweging, hetzij krachtens bijzondere overeenkomst, aan boord van haar hospitaalschepen onzijdige waarnemers plaatsen, die zullen vaststellen of de bepalingen van dit Verdrag strikt worden nageleefd.  

### Artikel  32  

De vaartuigen, bedoeld in de artikelen 22, 24, 25 en 27, zijn niet gelijkgesteld met oorlogsschepen wat betreft hun verblijf in een onzijdige haven.  

### Artikel  33  

Koopvaardijschepen welke verbouwd zijn tot hospitaalschepen, mogen voor de gehele duur der vijandelijkheden niet voor enig ander doel worden gebruikt.  

### Artikel  34  

De bescherming waarop hospitaalschepen en ziekenboegen recht hebben, zal niet eindigen, tenzij daarvan, buiten hun menslievende taak, gebruik wordt gemaakt voor het plegen van voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen. De bescherming zal echter eerst eindigen na een sommatie waarbij, in alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen, een redelijke termijn is gesteld en waaraan geen gevolg is gegeven. In het bijzonder mogen hospitaalschepen geen geheime code bezitten of gebruiken voor hun draadloze telegrafie of andere verbindingsmiddelen.  

### Artikel  35  

Als redenen welke de hospitaalschepen of de ziekenboegen van schepen de hun verschuldigde bescherming doen verliezen, worden niet beschouwd: 

1. het feit, dat het personeel van deze schepen of ziekenboegen gewapend is en van zijn wapens gebruik maakt voor de handhaving van de orde, tot verdediging van zichzelf of van de gewonden en zieken;  

2. het feit, dat zich aan boord toestellen bevinden welke uitsluitend dienen om de navigatie of de verbindingen te vergemakkelijken;  

3. het feit, dat aan boord van hospitaalschepen of in ziekenboegen draagbare wapens en munitie worden aangetroffen welke aan de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen zijn ontnomen en nog niet aan de bevoegde tak van dienst zijn afgeleverd;  

4. het feit, dat de menslievende werkzaamheden aan boord van hospitaalschepen en in ziekenboegen van schepen of van hun personeel zich uitstrekken tot de verzorging van burgergewonden, -zieken, of -schipbreukelingen;  

5. het feit, dat hospitaalschepen materieel en personeel, uitsluitend bestemd voor geneeskundige doeleinden, vervoeren boven de normale behoeften van het schip.    

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Van het personeel

### Artikel  36  

Het geestelijk, geneeskundig en hospitaalpersoneel van hospitaalschepen en hun bemanningen moeten worden ontzien en beschermd; zij mogen niet gevangen genomen worden gedurende de tijd, dat zij in de rol lopen van het hospitaalschip, onverschillig of er al dan niet gewonden en zieken aan boord zijn.  

### Artikel  37  

Het geestelijk, geneeskundig en hospitaalpersoneel, belast met de geneeskundige of geestelijke verzorging van de in de artikelen 12 en 13 bedoelde personen, moet, indien het in handen van de vijand valt, worden ontzien en beschermd; het mag zijn werkzaamheden voortzetten zolang zulks noodzakelijk is voor de verzorging van de gewonden en zieken. Het moet daarna worden teruggezonden zodra de opperbevelhebber onder wiens gezag het staat, zulks mogelijk oordeelt. Bij het verlaten van het schip mag het zijn persoonlijke eigendommen medenemen. Indien het evenwel wegens de geneeskundige of geestelijke behoeften van krijgsgevangenen noodzakelijk blijkt een deel van dit personeel aan te houden, zal alles in het werk worden gesteld om het zo spoedig mogelijk te ontschepen. Het aangehouden personeel is na ontscheping onderworpen aan de bepalingen van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Van de geneeskundige transporten

### Artikel  38  

Schepen, voor dit doel gecharterd, zijn gerechtigd materieel te vervoeren, uitsluitend bestemd voor het behandelen van de gewonden en zieken van de strijdkrachten of voor het voorkomen van ziekten, mits de bijzonderheden betreffende hun reis zijn medegedeeld aan de tegenpartij en door deze zijn goedgekeurd. De tegenpartij behoudt het recht deze schepen aan te houden, maar heeft niet het recht hen prijs te maken noch de lading in beslag te nemen. Bij overeenkomst tussen de Partijen bij het conflict kunnen onzijdige waarnemers aan boord van deze schepen worden geplaatst om de lading te contrôleren. Te dien einde moet hun vrije toegang tot de lading worden gegeven.  

### Artikel  39  

Hospitaalvliegtuigen, waaronder te verstaan vliegtuigen welke uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor de evacuatie van gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen dan wel voor het vervoer van geneeskundig personeel en materieel, mogen niet worden aangevallen, maar moeten door de Partijen bij het conflict worden ontzien zolang zij vliegen op hoogten, op tijden en volgens routes, zoals deze uitdrukkelijk bij overeenkomst tussen alle betrokken Partijen bij het conflict zijn vastgesteld. Zij moeten op hun onder-, boven- en zijvlakken, behalve van de nationale kleuren, duidelijk zichtbaar voorzien zijn van het in artikel 41 bedoelde kenteken. Zij zullen ieder ander kenmerk of herkenningsteken voeren, dat bij het uitbreken van of gedurende de vijandelijkheden bij overeenkomst tussen de Partijen bij het conflict mocht zijn vastgesteld. Tenzij anders overeengekomen, is het overvliegen van vijandelijk of door de vijand bezet gebied verboden. Hospitaalvliegtuigen moeten aan iedere sommatie om te landen gevolg geven. In geval van een zodanige gedwongen landing mag het vliegtuig met de inzittenden, na een eventueel onderzoek, zijn vlucht vervolgen. In geval van een noodlanding op vijandelijk of door de vijand bezet gebied zullen de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, evenals de bemanning van het vliegtuig, krijgsgevangenen zijn. Het geneeskundig personeel zal worden behandeld overeenkomstig de artikelen 36 en 37.  

### Artikel  40  

De hospitaalvliegtuigen van de Partijen bij het conflict mogen, behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede lid, over het grondgebied van onzijdige Mogendheden vliegen, daarop in geval van nood landen of een tussenlanding maken. Zij moeten de onzijdige Mogendheden tevoren in kennis stellen met hun vlucht over het betrokken grondgebied en aan iedere sommatie om te landen of op het water neer te strijken gevolg geven. Zij mogen niet worden aangevallen zolang zij vliegen op hoogten, op tijden en volgens routes, zoals deze uitdrukkelijk bij overeenkomst tussen de Partijen bij het conflict en de betrokken onzijdige Mogendheden zijn vastgesteld. De onzijdige Mogendheden kunnen echter aan het overvliegen van of het landen op haar grondgebied door hospitaalvliegtuigen voorwaarden of beperkingen verbinden. Zodanige voorwaarden of beperkingen zullen ten aanzien van alle Partijen bij het conflict gelijkelijk worden toegepast. Tenzij tussen de onzijdige Staat en de Partijen bij het conflict anders is overeengekomen, moeten de gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen, die met toestemming van de plaatselijke autoriteiten door een hospitaalvliegtuig op onzijdig gebied worden ontscheept, in de gevallen waarin het internationale recht zulks voorschrijft, op zodanige wijze door de onzijdige Staat worden bewaakt, dat zij niet opnieuw aan de krijgsverrichtingen kunnen deelnemen. De hospitaalen interneringskosten zullen worden gedragen door de Mogendheid tot welke de gewonden, zieken of schipbreukelingen behoren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Van het kenteken

### Artikel  41  

Onder toezicht van de bevoegde militaire autoriteit, zal het rode kruis embleem op wit veld worden gevoerd op de vlaggen, de armbanden en op al het door de Geneeskundige Dienst gebruikte materieel. Evenwel worden voor de landen die reeds, in plaats van het rode kruis, de rode halve maan of de rode leeuw en zon op wit veld als kenteken gebruiken, deze emblemen eveneens in de zin van dit Verdrag erkend.  

### Artikel  42  

Het personeel, bedoeld in de artikelen 36 en 37, zal een door de bevoegde militaire autoriteit verstrekte en gestempelde band welke tegen vocht bestand is en voorzien is van het kenteken, aan de linkerarm vastgehecht, dragen. Dit personeel zal, behalve het in artikel 19 bedoelde identiteitsplaatje, een speciale identiteitskaart bij zich dragen, welke is voorzien van het kenteken. Deze kaart moet tegen vocht bestand zijn en van zodanige afmetingen, dat zij in de zak kan worden gedragen. Zij zal worden opgesteld in de landstaal, ten minste de geslachtsnaam en voornamen, de geboortedatum, de rang en het leger- of stamboeknummer van de houder vermelden en tevens aantonen op grond van welke hoedanigheid hij recht heeft op de bescherming van dit Verdrag. De kaart zal voorzien zijn van een fotografie van de houder en voorts hetzij van zijn handtekening hetzij van zijn vingerafdrukken, dan wel van beide, alsmede van het droogstempel van de bevoegde militaire autoriteit. De identiteitskaart moet voor iedere krijgsmacht van één standaardmodel zijn en, voor zover mogelijk, bij de krijgsmachten van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen van eenzelfde model. De Partijen bij het conflict kunnen zich laten leiden door het model dat bij wijze van voorbeeld als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is gehecht. Zij zullen elkander, bij het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, inlichten omtrent het model dat zij gebruiken. Iedere identiteitskaart zal, zo mogelijk, ten minste in tweevoud worden opgemaakt; één exemplaar zal worden bewaard door de eigen Mogendheid. In geen geval mogen aan het hierboven bedoelde personeel de onderscheidingstekenen of de identiteitskaart worden ontnomen, noch het recht worden ontzegd de armband te dragen. Bij verlies heeft dit personeel recht op verstrekking van een duplicaat van de kaart en op vervanging van de onderscheidingstekenen.  

### Artikel  43  

De vaartuigen, bedoeld in de artikelen 22, 24, 25 en 27, moeten van de volgende kentekenen voorzien zijn: 

a. alle uitwendige oppervlakten moeten wit zijn;  

b. één of meer donkerrode kruizen, zo groot mogelijk, moeten aan iedere zijde van de romp en op de horizontale oppervlakten op zodanige wijze worden aangebracht, dat zij zo duidelijk mogelijk van de zee af en uit de lucht zichtbaar zijn.   Alle hospitaalschepen zullen zich kenbaar maken door het: hijsen van hun nationale vlag en voorts, indien zij behoren tot een onzijdige Staat, van de vlag van de Partij bij het conflict, onder wier leiding zij zich hebben gesteld. Een witte vlag met een rood kruis moet zo hoog mogelijk aan de grote mast worden gevoerd. Reddingboten van hospitaalschepen, kustreddingboten en alle kleine vaartuigen, in gebruik bij de Geneeskundige Dienst, zullen wit geschilderd zijn met duidelijk zichtbare donkerrode kruizen en zullen, in het algemeen, op dezelfde wijze van kentekenen voorzien zijn als hierboven voor hospitaalschepen is voorgeschreven. Bovengenoemde schepen en vaartuigen welke zich des nachts en bij beperkt zicht willen verzekeren van de bescherming waarop zij recht hebben, moeten, met toestemming van de Partij bij het conflict, onder wier gezag zij staan, de nodige maatregelen nemen om hun kleuren en kentekenen voldoende te doen uitkomen. Hospitaalschepen welke krachtens artikel 31 tijdelijk door de vijand worden aangehouden, moeten de nationale vlag van de Partij bij het conflict, in wier dienst zij staan of onder wier leiding zij zich hebben gesteld, strijken. Aan kustreddingboten welke met toestemming van de bezettende Mogendheid haar werkzaamheden van een bezette basis uit voortzetten, kan worden toegestaan, dat zij haar nationale vlag naast een rode kruis vlag blijven voeren, wanneer zij afwezig zijn van haar basis, behoudens voorafgaande kennisgeving aan alle betrokken Partijen bij het conflict. Alle bepalingen in dit artikel welke het rode kruis embleem betreffen, zijn eveneens van toepassing op de andere in artikel 41 genoemde emblemen. De Partijen bij het conflict moeten er te allen tijde naar streven overeenkomsten te sluiten, ten einde de modernste methoden welke te harer beschikking staan, te gebruiken om de herkenning van de in dit artikel bedoelde vaartuigen te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  44  

De in artikel 43 bedoelde kentekenen mogen, zowel in tijd van vrede als in tijd van oorlog, slechts worden gebruikt tot aanduiding of bescherming van de aldaar genoemde vaartuigen, behoudens in de gevallen welke mochten zijn voorzien in een ander internationaal Verdrag of bij overeenkomst tussen alle betrokken Partijen bij het conflict.  

### Artikel  45  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen, indien haar wetgeving thans daarin nog niet volledig voorziet, maatregelen nemen, nodig om te allen tijde misbruik, bedoeld in artikel 43, tegen te gaan en te bestraffen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Van de tenuitvoerlegging van het Verdrag

### Artikel  46  

Iedere Partij bij het conflict zal, door tussenkomst van haar opperbevelhebbers, nadere voorzieningen treffen voor de uitvoering van de voorgaande artikelen, alsmede voor onvoorziene gevallen, overeenkomstig de algemene beginselen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  47  

Represaillemaatregelen ten aanzien van gewonden, zieken, schipbreukelingen, personeel, vaartuigen of materieel, beschermd door het Verdrag, zijn verboden.  

### Artikel  48  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich de tekst van dit Verdrag, zowel in tijd van vrede als in tijd van oorlog, zo ruim mogelijk in haar onderscheiden landen te verspreiden en in het bijzonder de bestudering daarvan in de programma's van haar militaire en, zo mogelijk, burgerlijke opleiding op te nemen, zodat de beginselen daarvan aan de gehele bevolking, in het bijzonder aan de strijdende troepen, het geneeskundig personeel en de geestelijken, bekend worden.  

### Artikel  49  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen elkander door tussenkomst van de Zwitserse Bondsraad en, tijdens de vijandelijkheden, door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheden de officiële vertalingen van dit Verdrag mededelen, benevens de wetten en voorschriften welke zij mochten aannemen om de toepassing daarvan te verzekeren.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####Van het tegengaan van misbruiken en inbreuken

### Artikel  50  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich alle wettelijke regelingen tot stand te brengen, nodig om doeltreffende strafbepalingen vast te stellen voor personen die één der ernstige inbreuken op dit Verdrag, omschreven in het volgend artikel, hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan hebben gegeven. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij is verplicht personen die ervan verdacht worden één van deze ernstige inbreuken te hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan te hebben gegeven, op te sporen en moet hen, ongeacht hun nationaliteit, voor haar eigen gerechten brengen. Zij kan hen ook, indien zij daaraan de voorkeur geeft, en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van haar eigen wetgeving, ter berechting overleveren aan een andere bij de vervolging belang hebbende Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, mits deze Verdragsluitende Partij een met voldoende bewijzen gestaafde telastlegging welke een vervolging rechtvaardigt, tegen de betrokken personen inbrengt. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zal maatregelen nemen, nodig om de met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag strijdige handelingen welke niet vallen onder de in het volgend artikel omschreven ernstige inbreuken, tegen te gaan. Onder alle omstandigheden zullen de verdachten de waarborgen genieten voor een behoorlijke berechting en verdediging, welke niet minder gunstig mogen zijn dan die, voorgeschreven in artikel 105 en volgende van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  51  

De ernstige inbreuken, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, zijn die welke één der volgende handelingen in zich sluiten, indien deze worden gepleegd tegen door het Verdrag beschermde personen of goederen: opzettelijke levensberoving, marteling of onmenselijke behandeling, waaronder begrepen biologische proefnemingen, het moedwillig veroorzaken van hevig lijden, van ernstig lichamelijk letsel, dan wel van ernstige schade aan de gezondheid, vernieling en toeeigening van goederen, niet gerechtvaardigd door militaire noodzaak en uitgevoerd op grote schaal en op onrechtmatige en moedwillige wijze.  

### Artikel  52  

Geen der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen mag zich zelf of een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij onttrekken aan enige op haar of op een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij rustende aansprakelijkheid op grond van de in het voorgaand artikel bedoelde inbreuken.  

### Artikel  53  

Op verzoek van een Partij bij het conflict moet, op een door de belanghebbende Partijen overeen te komen wijze, een onderzoek worden ingesteld naar iedere beweerde schending van het Verdrag. Indien geen overeenstemming over de procedure van het onderzoek wordt bereikt, zullen de Partijen zich met elkander verstaan over de keuze van een scheidsrechter, die omtrent de te volgen procedure zal beslissen. Wanneer de schending is vastgesteld, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict daaraan een einde maken en deze zo spoedig mogelijk bestraffen.
