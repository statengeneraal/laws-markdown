##Verdrag van Genève betreffende de bescherming van burgers in oorlogstijd

####GENEVA CONVENTION RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF CIVILIAN PERSONS IN TIME OF WAR OF AUGUST 12, 1949

The undersigned Plenipotentiaries of the Governments represented at the Diplomatic Conference held at Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949, for the purpose of establishing a Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, have agreed as follows:    

### PART  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  1  

The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.  

### Article  2  

In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.  

### Article  3  

In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occuring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: 

(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed *hors de combat* by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: 

(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;  

(b) taking of hostages;  

(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;  

(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.    

(2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.   An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  4  

Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals. Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are. The provisions of Part II are, however, wider in application, as defined in Article 13. Persons protected by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, or by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, or by the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, shall not be considered as protected persons within the meaning of the present Convention.  

### Article  5  

Where, in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention as would, if exercised in the favour of such individual person, be prejudicial to the security of such State. Where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as a spy or saboteur, or as a person under definite suspicion of activity hostile to the security of the Occupying Power, such person shall, in those cases where absolute military security so requires, be regarded as having forfeited rights of communication under the present Convention. In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity, and in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention. They shall also be granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person under the present Convention at the earliest date consistent with the security of the State or Occupying Power, as the case may be.  

### Article  6  

The present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2. In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations. In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however, the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to the extent that such Power exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention: 1 to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143. Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re-establishment may take place after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.  

### Article  7  

In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 11, 14, 15, 17, 36, 108, 109, 132, 133 and 149, the High Contracting Parties may conclude other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of protected persons, as defined by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them. Protected persons shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as long as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions to the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one or other of the Parties to the conflict.  

### Article  8  

Protected persons may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.  

### Article  9  

The present Convention shall be applied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties. The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible the task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers. The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular, take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they carry out their duties.  

### Article  10  

The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of civilian persons and for their relief.  

### Article  11  

The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention. When persons protected by the present Convention do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict. If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by Protecting Powers under the present Convention. Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and to discharge them impartially. No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied. Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power, such mention applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present Article. The provisions of this Article shall extend and be adapted to cases of nationals of a neutral State who are in occupied territory or who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State in which the State of which they are nationals has not normal diplomatic representation.  

### Article  12  

In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons, particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement. For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a meeting of their representatives, and in particular of the authorities responsible for protected persons, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part in such a meeting.  

### PART  II  

####GENERAL PROTECTION OF POPULATIONS AGAINST CERTAIN CONSEQUENCES OF WAR

### Article  13  

The provisions of Part II cover the whole of the populations of the countries in conflict, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, nationality, religion or political opinion, and are intended to alleviate the sufferings caused by war.  

### Article  14  

In time of peace, the High Contracting Parties and, after the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties thereto, may establish in their own territory and, if the need arises, in occupied areas, hospital and safety zones and localities so organized as to protect from the effects of war, wounded, sick and aged persons, children under fifteen, expectant mothers and mothers of children under seven. Upon the outbreak and during the course of hostilities, the Parties concerned may conclude agreements on mutual recognition of the zones and localities they have created. They may for this purpose implement the provisions of the Draft Agreement annexed to the present Convention, with such amendments as they may consider necessary. The Protecting Powers and the International Committee of the Red Cross are invited to lend their good offices in order to facilitate the institution and recognition of these hospital and safety zones and localities.  

### Article  15  

Any Party to the conflict may, either direct or through a neutral State or some humanitarian organization, propose to the adverse Party to establish, in the regions where fighting is taking place, neutralized zones intended to shelter from the effects of war the following persons, without distinction: 

(a) wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants;  

(b) civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character.   When the Parties concerned have agreed upon the geographical position, administration, food supply and supervision of the proposed neutralized zone, a written agreement shall be concluded and signed by the representatives of the Parties to the conflict. The agreement shall fix the beginning and the duration of the neutralization of the zone.  

### Article  16  

The wounded and sick, as well as the infirm, and expectant mothers, shall be the object of particular protection and respect. As far as military considerations allow, each Party to the conflict shall facilitate the steps taken to search for the killed and wounded, to assist the shipwrecked and other persons exposed to grave danger, and to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment.  

### Article  17  

The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to conclude local agreements for the removal from besieged or encircled areas, of wounded, sick, infirm, and aged persons, children and maternity cases, and for the passage of ministers of all religions, medical personnel and medical equipment on their way to such areas.  

### Article  18  

Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict. States which are Parties to a conflict shall provide all civilian hospitals with certificates showing that they are civilian hospitals and that the buildings which they occupy are not used for any purpose which would deprive these hospitals of protection in accordance with Article 19. Civilian hospitals shall be marked by means of the emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, but only if so authorized by the State. The Parties to the conflict shall, in so far as military considerations permit, take the necessary steps to make the distinctive emblems indicating civilian hospitals clearly visible to the enemy land, air and naval forces in order to obviate the possibility of any hostile action. In view of the dangers to which hospitals may be exposed by being close to military objectives, it is recommended that such hospitals be situated as far as possible from such objectives.  

### Article  19  

The protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded. The fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are nursed in these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.  

### Article  20  

Persons regularly and solely engaged in the operation and administration of civilian hospitals, including the personnel engaged in the search for, removal and transporting of and caring for wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases, shall be respected and protected. In occupied territory and in zones of military operations, the above personnel shall be recognizable by means of an identity card certifying their status, bearing the photograph of the holder and embossed with the stamp of the responsible authority, and also by means of a stamped, water-resistant armlet which they shall wear on the left arm while carrying out their duties. This armlet shall be issued by the State and shall bear the emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949. Other personnel who are engaged in the operation and administration of civilian hospitals shall be entitled to respect and protection and to wear the armlet, as provided in and under the conditions prescribed in this Article, while they are employed on such duties. The identity card shall state the duties on which they are employed. The management of each hospital shall at all times hold at the disposal of the competent national or occupying authorities an up-to-date list of such personnel.  

### Article  21  

Convoys of vehicles or hospital trains on land or specially provided vessels on sea, conveying wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases, shall be respected and protected in the same manner as the hospitals provided for in Article 18, and shall be marked, with the consent of the State, by the display of the distinctive emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.  

### Article  22  

Aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases, or for the transport of medical personnel and equipment, shall not be attacked, but shall be respected while flying at heights, times and on routes specifically agreed upon between all the Parties to the conflict concerned. They may be marked with the distinctive emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949. Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are prohibited. Such aircraft shall obey every summons to land. In the event of a landing thus imposed, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its flight after examination, if any.  

### Article  23  

Each High Contracting Party shall allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital stores and objects necessary for religious worship intended only for civilians of another High Contracting Party, even if the latter is its adversary. It shall likewise permit the free passage of all consignments of essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant mothers and maternity cases. The obligation of a High Contracting Party to allow the free passage of the consignments indicated in the preceding paragraph is subject to the condition that this Party is satisfied that there are no serious reasons for fearing: 

(a) that the consignments may be diverted from their destination,  

(b) that the control may not be effective, or  

(c) that a definite advantage may accrue to the military efforts or economy of the enemy through the substitution of the above-mentioned consignments for goods which would otherwise be provided or produced by the enemy or through the release of such material, services or facilities as would otherwise be required for the production of such goods.   The Power which allows the passage of the consignments indicated in the first paragraph of this Article may make such permission conditional on the distribution to the persons benefited thereby being made under the local supervision of the Protecting Powers. Such consignments shall be forwarded as rapidly as possibly, and the Power which permits their free passage shall have the right to prescribe the technical arrangements under which such passage is allowed.  

### Article  24  

The Parties to the conflict shall take the necessary measures to ensure that children under fifteen, who are orphaned or are separated from their families as a result of the war, are not left to their own resources, and that their maintenance, the excercise of their religion and their education are facilitated in all circumstances. Their education shall, as far as possible, be entrusted to persons of a similar cultural tradition. The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate the reception of such children in a neutral country for the duration of the conflict with the consent of the Protecting Power, if any, and under due safeguards for the observance of the principles stated in the first paragraph. They shall, furthermore, endeavour to arrange for all children under twelve to be identified by the wearing of identity discs, or by some other means.  

### Article  25  

All persons in the territory of a Party to the conflict, or in a territory occupied by it, shall be enabled to give news of a strictly personal nature to members of their families, wherever they may be, and to receive news from them. This correspondence shall be forwarded speedily and without undue delay. If, as a result of circumstances, it becomes difficult or impossible to exchange family correspondence by the ordinary post, the Parties to the conflict concerned shall apply to a neutral intermediary, such as the Central Agency provided for in Article 140, and shall decide in consultation with it how to ensure the fulfilment of their obligations under the best possible conditions, in particular with the cooperation of the National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies. If the Parties to the conflict deem it necessary to restrict amily correspondence, such restrictions shall be confined to the compulsory use at standard forms containing twenty-five freely chosen words, and to the limitation of the number of these forms despatched to one each month.  

### Article  26  

Each Party to the conflict shall facilitate enquiries made by members of families dispersed owing to the war, with the object of renewing contact with one another and of meeting, if possible. It shall encourage, in particular, the work of organizations engaged on this task provided they are acceptable to it and conform to its security regulations.  

### PART  III  

####STATUS AND TREATMENT OF PROTECTED PERSONS

### SECTION  I  

####PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE TERRITORIES OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT AND TO OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

### Article  27  

Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault. Without prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by the Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion. However, the Parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security in regard to protected persons as may be necessary as a result of the war.  

### Article  28  

The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.  

### Article  29  

The Party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be, is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents, irrespective of any individual responsibility which may be incurred.  

### Article  30  

Protected persons shall have every facility for making application to the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Society of the country where they may be, as well as to any organization that might assist them. These several organizations shall be granted all facilities for that purpose by the authorities, within the bounds set by military or security considerations. Apart from the visits of the delegates of the Protecting Powers and of the International Committee of the Red Cross, provided for by Article 143, the Detaining or Occupying Powers shall facilitate as much as possible visits to protected persons by the representatives of other organizations whose object is to give spiritual aid or material relief to such persons.  

### Article  31  

No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected persons, in particular to obtain information from them or from third parties.  

### Article  32  

The High Contracting Parties specifically agree that each of them is prohibited from taking any measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies not only to murder, torture, corporal punishment, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment of a protected person, but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.  

### Article  33  

No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited. Pillage is prohibited. Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited.  

### Article  34  

The taking of hostages is prohibited.  

### SECTION  II  

####ALIENS IN THE TERRITORY OF A PARTY TO THE CONFLICT

### Article  35  

All protected persons who may desire to leave the territory at the outset of, or during a conflict, shall be entitled to do so, unless their departure is contrary to the national interests of the State. The applications of such persons to leave shall be decided in accordance with regularly established procedures and the decision shall be taken as rapidly as possible. These persons permitted to leave may provide themselves with the necessary funds for their journey and take with them a reasonable amount of their effects and articles of personal use. If any such person is refused permission to leave the territory, he shall be entitled to have such refusal reconsidered as soon as possible by an appropriate court or administrative board designated by the Detaining Power for that purpose. Upon request, representatives of the Protecting Power shall, unless reasons of security prevent it, or the persons concerned object, be furnished with the reasons for refusal of any request for permission to leave the territory and be given, as expeditiously as possible, the names of all persons who have been denied permission to leave.  

### Article  36  

Departures permitted under the foregoing Article shall be carried out in satisfactory conditions as regards safety, hygiene, sanitation and food. All costs in connection therewith, from the point of exit in the territory of the Detaining Power, shall be borne by the country of destination, or, in the case of accommodation in a neutral country, by the Power whose nationals are benefited. The practical details of such movements may, if necessary, be settled by special agreements between the Powers concerned. The foregoing shall not prejudice such special agreements as may be concluded between Parties to the conflict concerning the exchange and repatriation of their nationals in enemy hands.  

### Article  37  

Protected persons who are confined pending proceedings or serving a sentence involving loss of liberty, shall during their confinement be humanely treated. As soon as they are released, they may ask to leave the territory in conformity with the foregoing Articles.  

### Article  38  

With the exception of special measures authorized by the present Convention, in particular by Articles 27 and 41 thereof, the situation of protected persons shall continue to be regulated, in principle, by the provisions concerning aliens in time of peace. In any case, the following rights shall be granted to them: 

(1) They shall be enabled to receive the individual or collective relief that may be sent to them.  

(2) They shall, if their state of health so requires, receive medical attention and hospital treatment to the same extent as the nationals of the State concerned.  

(3) They shall be allowed to practise their religion and to receive spiritual assistance from ministers of their faith.  

(4) If they reside in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war, they shall be authorized to move from that area to the same extent as the nationals of the State concerned.  

(5) Children under fifteen years, pregnant women and mothers of children under seven years shall benefit by any preferential treatment to the same extent as the nationals of the State concerned.    

### Article  39  

Protected persons who, as a result of the war, have lost their gainful employment, shall be granted the opportunity to find paid employment. That opportunity shall, subject to security considerations and to the provisions of Article 40, be equal to that enjoyed by the nationals of the Power in whose territory they are. Where a Party to the conflict applies to a protected person methods of control which result in his being unable to support himself, and especially if such a person is prevented for reasons of security from finding paid employment on reasonable conditions, the said Party shall ensure his support and that of his dependents. Protected persons may in any case receive allowances from their home country, the Protecting Power, or the relief societies referred to in Article 30.  

### Article  40  

Protected persons may be compelled to work only to the same extent as nationals of the Party to the conflict in whose territory they are. If protected persons are of enemy nationality, they may only be compelled to do work which is normally necessary to ensure the feeding, sheltering, clothing, transport and health of human beings and which is not directly related to the conduct of military operations. In the cases mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs, protected persons compelled to work shall have the benefit of the same working conditions and of the same safeguards as national workers, in particular as regards wages, hours of labour, clothing and equipment, previous training and compensation for occupational accidents and diseases. If the above provisions are infringed, protected persons shall be allowed to exercise their right of complaint in accordance with Article 30.  

### Article  41  

Should the Power in whose hands protected persons may be consider the measures of control mentioned in the present Convention to be inadequate, it may not have recourse to any other measure of control more severe than that of assigned residence or internment, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 42 and 43. In applying the provisions of Article 39, second paragraph, to the cases of persons required to leave their usual places of residence by virtue of a decision placing them in assigned residence elsewhere, the Detaining Power shall be guided as closely as possible by the standards of welfare set forth in Part III, Section IV of this Convention.  

### Article  42  

The interment or placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be ordered only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary. If any person, acting through the representatives of the Protecting Power, voluntarily demands internment, and if his situation renders this step necessary, he shall be interned by the Power in whose hands he may be.  

### Article  43  

Any protected person who has been interned or placed in assigned residence shall be entitled to have such action reconsidered as soon as possibly by an appropriate court or administrative board designated by the Detaining Power for that purpose. If the internment or placing in assigned residence is maintained, the court or administrative board shall periodically, and at least twice yearly, give consideration to his or her case with a view to the favourable amendment of the initial decision, if circumstances permit. Unless the protected persons concerned object, the Detaining Power shall, as rapidly as possible, give the Protecting Power the names of any protected persons who have been interned or subjected to assigned residence, or who have been released from internment or assigned residence. The decisions of the courts or boards mentioned in the first paragraph of the present Article shall also, subject to the same conditions, be notified as rapidly as possible to the Protecting Power.  

### Article  44  

In applying the measures of control mentioned in the present Convention, the Detaining Power shall not treat as enemy aliens exclusively on the basis of their nationality *de jure* of an enemy State, refugees who do not, in fact, enjoy the protection of any government.  

### Article  45  

Protected persons shall not be transferred to a Power which is not a party to the Convention. This provision shall in no way constitute an obstacle to the repatriation of protected persons, or to their return to their country of residence after the cessation of hostilities. Protected persons may be transferred by the Detaining Power only to a Power which is a party to the present Convention and after the Detaining Power has satisfied itself of the willingess and ability of such transferee Power to apply the present Convention. If protected persons are transferred under such circumstances, responsibility for the application of the present Convention rests on the Power accepting them, while they are in its custody. Nevertheless, if that Power fails to carry out the provisions of the present Convention in any important respect, the Power by which the protected persons were transferred shall, upon being so notified by the Protecting Power, take effective measures to correct the situation or shall request the return of the protected persons. Such request must be complied with. In no circumstances shall a protected person be transferred to a country where he or she may have reason to fear persecution for his or her political opinions or religious beliefs. The provisions of this Article do not constitute an obstacle to the extradition, in pursuance of extradition treaties concluded before the outbreak of hostilities, of protected persons accused of offences against ordinary criminal law.  

### Article  46  

Is so far as they have not been previously withdrawn, restrictive measures taken regarding protected persons shall be cancelled as soon as possible after the close of hostilities. Restrictive measures affecting their property shall be cancelled, in accordance with the law of the Detaining Power, as soon as possible after the close of hostilities.  

### SECTION  III  

####OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

### Article  47  

Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.  

### Article  48  

Protected persons who are not nationals of the Power whose territory is occupied, may avail themselves of the right to leave the territory subject to the provisions of Article 35, and decisions thereon shall be taken according to the procedure which the Occupying Power shall establish in accordance with the said Article.  

### Article  49  

Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased. The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated. The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place. The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.  

### Article  50  

The Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children. The Occupying Power shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the identification of children and the registration of their parentage. It may not, in any case, change their personal status, nor enlist them in formations or organizations subordinate to it. Should the local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements for the maintenance and education, if possible by persons of their own nationality, language and religion, of children who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend. A special section of the Bureau set up in accordance with Article 136 shall be responsible for taking all necessary steps to identify children whose identity is in doubt. Particulars of their parents or other near relatives should always be recorded if available. The Occupying Power shall not hinder the application of any preferential measures in regard to food, medical care and protection against the effects of war, which may have been adopted prior to the occupation in favour of children under fifteen years, expectant mothers, and mothers of children under seven years.  

### Article  51  

The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted. The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to work unless they are over eighteen years of age, and then only on work which is necessary either for the needs of the army of occupation, or for the public utility services, or for the feeding, sheltering, clothing, transportation or health of the population of the occupied country. Protected persons may not be compelled to undertake any work which would involve them in the obligation of taking part in military operations. The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to employ forcible means to ensure the security of the installations where they are performing compulsory labour. The work shall be carried out only in the occupied territory where the persons whose services have been requisitioned are. Every such person shall, so far as possible, be kept in his usual place of employment. Workers shall be paid a fair wage and the work shall be proportionate to their physical and intellectual capacities. The legislation in force in the occupied country concerning working conditions, and safeguards as regards, in particular, such matters as wages, hours of work, equipment, preliminary training and compensation for occupational accidents and diseases, shall be applicable to the protected persons assigned to the work referred to in this Article. In no case shall requisition of labour lead to a mobilisation of workers in an organization of a military or semi-military character.  

### Article  52  

No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker, whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power's intervention. All measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to work for the Occupying Power, are prohibited.  

### Article  53  

Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where, such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  

### Article  54  

The Occupying Power may not alter the status of public officials or judges in the occupied territories, or in any way apply sanctions to or take any measures of coercion or discrimination against them, should they abstain from fulfilling their functions for reasons of conscience. This prohibition does not prejudice the application of the second paragraph of Article 51. It does not affect the right of the Occupying Power to remove public officials from their posts.  

### Article  55  

To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate. The Occupying Power may not requisition foodstuffs, articles or medical supplies available in the occupied territory, except for use by the occupation forces and administration personnel, and then only if the requirements of the civilian population have been taken into account. Subject to the provisions of other international Conventions, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements to ensure that fair value is paid for any requisitioned goods. The Protecting Power shall, at any time, be at liberty to verify the state of the food and medical supplies in occupied territories, except where temporary restrictions are made necessary by imperative military requirements.  

### Article  56  

To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics. Medical personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out their duties. If new hospitals are set up in occupied territory and if the competent organs of the occupied State are not operating there, the occupying authorities shall, if necessary, grant them the recognition provided for in Article 18. In similar circumstances, the occupying authorities shall also grant recognition to hospital personnel and transport vehicles under the provisions of Articles 20 and 21. In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.  

### Article  57  

The Occupying Power may requisition civilian hospitals only temporarily and only in cases of urgent necessity for the care of military wounded and sick, and then on condition that suitable arrangements are made in due time for the care and treatment of the patients and for the needs of the civilian population for hospital accommodation. The material and stores of civilian hospitals cannot be requisitioned so long as they are necessary for the needs of the civilian population.  

### Article  58  

The Occupying Power shall permit ministers of religion to give spiritual assistance to the members of their religious communities. The Occupying Power shall also accept consignments of books and articles required for religious needs and shall facilitate their distribution in occupied territory.  

### Article  59  

If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection. A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.  

### Article  60  

Relief consignments shall in no way relieve the Occupying Power of any of its responsibilities under Articles 55, 56 and 59. The Occupying Power shall in no way whatsoever divert relief consignments from the purpose for which they are intended, except in cases of urgent necessity, in the interests of the population of the occupied territory and with the consent of the Protecting Power.  

### Article  61  

The distribution of the relief consignments referred to in the foregoing Articles shall be carried out with the cooperation and under the supervision of the Protecting Power. This duty may also be delegated, by agreement between the Occupying Power and the Protecting Power, to a neutral Power, to the International Committee of the Red Cross or to any other impartial humanitarian body. Such consignments shall be exempt in occupied territory from all charges, taxes or customs duties unless these are necessary in the interests of the economy of the territory. The Occupying Power shall facilitate the rapid distribution of these consignments. All Contracting Parties shall endeavour to permit the transit and transport, free of charge, of such relief consignments on their way to occupied territories.  

### Article  62  

Subject to imperative reasons of security, protected persons in occupied territories shall be permitted to receive the individual relief consignments sent to them.  

### Article  63  

Subject to temporary and exceptional measures imposed for urgent reasons of security by the Occupying Power: 

(a) recognized National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies shall be able to pursue their activities in accordance with Red Cross principles, as defined by the International Red Cross Conferences. Other relief societies shall be permitted to continue their humanitarian activities under similar conditions;  

(b) the Occupying Power may not require any changes in the personnel or structure of these societies, which would prejudice the aforesaid activities.   The same principles shall apply to the activities and personnel of special organizations of a non-military character, which already exist or which may be established, for the purpose of ensuring the living conditions of the civilian population by the maintenance of the essential public utility services, by the distribution of relief and by the organization of rescues.  

### Article  64  

The penal laws of the occupied territory shall remain in force, with the exception that they may be repealed or suspended by the Occupying Power in cases where they constitute a threat to its security or an obstacle to the application of fhe present Convention. Subject to the latter consideration and to the necessity for ensuring the effective administration of justice, the tribunals of the occupied territory shall continue to function in respect of all offences covered by the said laws. The Occupying Power may, however, subject the population of the occupied territory to provisions which are essential to enable the Occupying Power to fulfil its obligations under the present Convention, to maintain the orderly government of the territory, and to ensure the security of the Occupying Power, of the members and property of the occupying forces or administration, and likewise of the establishments and lines of communication used by them.  

### Article  65  

The penal provisions enacted by the Occupying Power shall not come into force before they have been published and brought to the knowledge of the inhabitants in their own language. The effect of these penal provisions shall not be retroactive.  

### Article  66  

In case of a breach of the penal provisions promulgated by it by virtue of the second paragraph of Article 64, the Occupying Power may hand over the accused to its properly constituted, non-political military courts, on condition that the said courts sit in the occupied country. Courts of appeal shall preferably sit in the occupied country.  

### Article  67  

The courts shall apply only those provisions of law which were applicable prior to the offence, and which are in accordance with general principles of law, in particular the principle that the penalty shall be proportionate to the offence. They shall take into consideration the fact that the accused is not a national of the Occupying Power.  

### Article  68  

Protected persons who commit an offence which is solely intended to harm the Occupying Power, but which does not constitute an attempt on the life or limb of members of the occupying forces or administration, nor a grave collective danger, nor seriously damage the property of the occupying forces or administration or the installations used by them, shall be liable to internment or simple imprisonment, provided the duration of such internment or imprisonment is proportionate to the offence committed. Furthermore, internment or imprisonment shall, for such offences, be the only measure adopted for depriving protected persons of liberty. The courts provided for under Article 66 of the present Convention may at their discretion convert a sentence of imprisonment to one of internment for the same period. The penal provisions promulgated by the Occupying Power in accordance with Articles 64 and 65 may impose the death penalty on a protected person only in cases where the person is guilty of espionage, of serious acts of sabotage against the military installations of the Occupying Power or of intentional offences which have caused the death of one or more persons, provided that such offences were punishable by death under the law of the occupied territory in force before the occupation began. The death penalty may not be pronounced against a protected person unless the attention of the court has been particularly called to the fact that since the accused is not a national of the Occupying Power, he is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance. In any case, he death penalty may not be pronounced against a protected person who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the offence.  

### Article  69  

In all cases, the duration of the period during which a protected person accused of an offence is under arrest awaiting trial or punishment shall be deducted from any period of imprisonment awarded.  

### Article  70  

Protected persons shall not be arrested, prosecuted or convicted by the Occupying Power for acts committed or for opinions expressed before the occupation, or during a temporary interruption thereof, with the exception of breaches of the laws and customs of war. Nationals of the occupying Power who, before the outbreak of hostilities, have sought refuge in the territory of the occupied State, shall not be arrested, prosecuted, convicted or deported from the occupied territory, except for offences committed after this outbreak of hostilities, or for offences under common law committed before the outbreak of hostilities which, according to the law of the occupied State, would have justified extradition in time of peace.  

### Article  71  

No sentence shall be pronounced by the competent courts of the Occupying Power except after a regular trial. Accused persons who are prosecuted by the Occupying Power shall be promptly informed, in writing, in a language which they understand, of the particulars of the charges preferred against them, and shall be brought to trial as rapidly as possible. The Protecting Power shall be informed of all proceedings instituted by the Occupying Power against protected persons in respect of charges involving the death penalty or imprisonment for two years or more; it shall be enabled, at any time, to obtain information regarding the state of such proceedings. Furthermore, the Protecting Power shall be entitled, on request, to be furnished with all particulars of these and of any other proceedings instituted by the Occupying Power against protected persons. The notification to the Protecting Power, as provided for in the second paragraph above, shall be sent immediately, and shall in any case reach the Protecting Power three weeks before the date of the first hearing. Unless, at the opening of the trial, evidence is submitted that the provisions of this Article are fully complied with, the trial shall not proceed. The notification shall include the following particulars: 

(a) description of the accused;  

(b) place of residence or detention;  

(c) specification of the charge or charges (with mention of the penal provisions under which it is brought);  

(d) designation of the court which will hear the case;  

(e) place and date of the first hearing.    

### Article  72  

Accused persons shall have the right to present evidence necessary to their defence and may, in particular, call witnesses. They shall have the right to be assisted by a qualified advocate or counsel of their own choice, who shall be able to visit them freely and shall enjoy the necessary facilities for preparing the defence. Failing a choice by the accused, the Protecting Power may provide him with an advocate or counsel. When an accused person has to meet a serious charge and the Protecting Power is not functioning, the Occupying Power, subject to the consent of the accused, shall provide an advocate or counsel. Accused persons shall, unless they freely waive such assistance, be aided by an interpreter, both during preliminary investigation and during the hearing in court. They shall have the right at any time to object to the interpreter and to ask for his replacement.  

### Article  73  

A convicted person shall have the right of appeal provided for by the laws applied by the court. He shall be fully informed of his right to appeal or petition and of the time limit within which he may do so. The penal procedure provided in the present Section shall apply, as far as it is applicable, to appeals. Where the laws applied by the Court make no provision for appeals, the convicted person shall have the right to petition against the finding and sentence to the competent authority of the Occupying Power.  

### Article  74  

Representatives of the Protecting Power shall have the right to attend the trial of any protected person, unless the hearing has, as an exceptional measure, to be held *in camera* in the interests of the security of the Occupying Power, which shall then notify the Protecting Power. A notification in respect of the date and place of trial shall be sent to the Protecting Power. Any judgment involving a sentence of death, or imprisonment for two years or more, shall be communicated, with the relevant grounds, as rapidly as possible to the Protecting Power. The notification shall contain a reference to the notification made under Article 71, and, in the case of sentences of imprisonment, the name of the place where the sentence is to be served. A record of judgments other than those referred to above shall he kept by the court and shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting Power. Any period allowed for appeal in the case of sentences involving the death penalty, or imprisonment of two years or more, shall not run until notification of judgment has been received by the Protecting Power.  

### Article  75  

In no case shall persons condemned to death be deprived of the right of petition for pardon or reprieve. No death sentence shall be carried out before the expiration of a period of at least six months from the date of receipt by the Protecting Power of the notification of the final judgment confirming such death sentence, or of an order denying pardon or reprieve. The six months period of suspension of the death sentence herein prescribed may be reduced in individual cases in circumstances of grave emergency involving an organized threat to the security of the Occupying Power or its forces, provided always that the Protecting Power is notified of such reduction and is given reasonable time and opportunity to make representations to the competent occupying authorities in respect of such death sentences.  

### Article  76  

Protected persons accused of offences shall be detained in the occupied country, and if convicted they shall serve their sentences therein. They shall, if possible, be separated from other detainees and shall enjoy conditions of food and hygiene which will be sufficient to keep them in good health, and which will be at least equal to those obtaining in prisons in the occupied country. They shall receive the medical attention required by their state of health. They shall also have the right to receive any spiritual assistance which they may require. Women shall be confined in separate quarters and shall be under the direct supervision of women. Proper regard shall be paid to the special treatment due to minors. Protected persons who are detained shall have the right to be visited by delegates of the Protecting Power and of the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with the provisions of Article 143. Such persons shall have the right to receive at least one relief parcel monthly.  

### Article  77  

Protected persons who have been accused of offences or convicted by the courts in occupied territory, shall be handed over at the close of occupation, with the relevant records, to the authorities of the liberated territory.  

### Article  78  

If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment. Decisions regarding such assigned residence or internment shall be made according to a regular procedure to be prescribed by the Occupying Power in accordance with the provisions of the present Convention. This procedure shall include the right of appeal for the parties concerned. Appeals shall be decided with the least possible delay. In the event of the decision being upheld, it shall be subject to periodical review, if possible every six months, by a competent body set up by the said Power. Protected persons made subject to assigned residence and thus required to leave their homes shall enjoy the full benefit of Article 39 of the present Convention.  

### SECTION  IV  

####REGULATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF INTERNEES

### CHAPTER  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  79  

The Parties to the conflict shall not intern protected persons, except in accordance with the provisions of Articles 41, 42, 43, 68 and 78.  

### Article  80  

Internees shall retain their full civil capacity and shall exercise such attendant rights as may be compatible with their status.  

### Article  81  

Parties to the conflict who intern protected persons shall be bound to provide free of charge for their maintenance, and to grant them also the medical attention required by their state of health. No deduction from the allowances, salaries or credits due to the internees shall be made for the repayment of these costs. The Detaining Power shall provide for the support of those dependent on the internees, if such dependents are without adequate means of support or are unable to earn a living.  

### Article  82  

The Detaining Power shall, as far as possible, accommodate the internees according to their nationality, language and customs. Internees who are nationals of the same country shall not be separated merely because they have different languages. Throughout the duration of their internment, members of the same family, and in particular parents and children, shall be lodged together in the same place of internment, except when separation of a temporary nature is necessitated for reasons of employment or health or for the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of Chapter IX of the present Section. Internees may request that their children who are left at liberty without parental care shall be interned with them. Wherever possible, interned members of the same family shall be housed in the same premises and given separate accommodation from other internees, together with faculties for leading a proper family life.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####PLACES OF INTERNMENT

### Article  83  

The Detaining Power shall not set up places of internment in areas particularly exposed to the dangers of war. The Detaining Power shall give the enemy Powers, through the intermediary of the Protecting Powers, all useful information regarding the geographical location of places of internment. Whenever military considerations permit, internment camps shall be indicated by the letters IC, placed so as to be clearly visible in the daytime from the air. The Powers concerned may, however, agree upon any other system of marking. No place other than an internment camp shall be marked as such.  

### Article  84  

Internees shall be accommodated and administered separately from prisoners of war and from persons deprived of liberty for any other reason.  

### Article  85  

The Detaining Power is bound to take all necessary and possible measures to ensure that protected persons shall, from the outset of their internment, be accommodated in buildings or quarters which afford every possible safeguard as regards hygiene and health, and provide efficient protection against the rigours of the climate and the effects of the war. In no case shall permanent places of internment be situated in unhealthy areas, or in districts the climate of which is injurious to the internees. In all cases where the district, in which a protected person is temporarily interned, is in an unhealthy area or has a climate which is harmful to his health, he shall be removed to a more suitable place of internment as rapidly as circumstances permit. The premises shall be fully protected from dampness, adequately heated and lighted, in particular between dusk and lights out. The sleeping quarters shall be sufficiently spacious and well ventilated, and the internees shall have suitable bedding and sufficient blankets, account being taken of the climate, and the age, sex, and state of health of the internees. Internees shall have for their use, day and night, sanitary conveniences which conform to the rules of hygiene and are constantly maintained in a state of cleanliness. They shall be provided with sufficient water and soap for their daily personal toilet and for washing their personal laundry; installations and facilities necessary for this purpose shall be granted to them. Showers or baths shall also be available. The necessary time shall be set aside for washing and for cleaning. Whenever it is necessary, as an exceptional and temporary measure, to accommodate women internees who are not members of a family unit in the same place of internment as men, the provision of separate sleeping quarters and sanitary conveniences for the use of such women internees shall be obligatory.  

### Article  86  

The Detaining Power shall place at the disposal of interned persons, of whatever denomination, premises suitable for the holding of their religious services.  

### Article  87  

Canteens shall be installed in every place of internment, except where other suitable facilities are available. Their purpose shall be to enable internees to make purchases, at prices not higher than local market prices, of foodstuffs and articles of everyday use, including soap and tobacco, such as would increase their personal well-being and comfort. Profits made by canteens shall be credited to a welfare fund to be set up for each place of internment, and administered for the benefit of the internees attached to such place of internment. The Internes Committee provided for in Article 102 shall have the right to check the management of the canteen and of the said fund. When a place of internment is closed down, the balance of the welfare fund shall be transferred to the welfare fund of a place of internment for internees of the same nationality, or, if such a place does not exist, to a central welfare fund which shall be administered for the benefit of all internees remaining in the custody of the Detaining Power. In case of a general release, the said profits shall be kept by the Detaining Power, subject to any agreement to the contrary between the Powers concerned.  

### Article  88  

In all places of internment exposed to air raids and other hazards of war, shelters adequate in number and structure to ensure the necessary protection shall be installed. In case of alarms, the internees shall be free to enter such shelters as quickly as possible, excepting those who remain for the protection of their quarters against the aforesaid hazards. Any protective measures taken in favour of the population shall also apply to them. Al due precautions must be taken in places of internment against the danger of fire.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####FOOD AND CLOTHING

### Article  89  

Daily food rations for internees shall be sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep internees in a good state of health and prevent the development of nutritional deficiencies. Account shall also be taken of the customary diet of the internees. Internees shall also be given the means by which they can prepare for themselves any additional food in their possession. Sufficient drinking water shall be supplied to internees. The use of tobacco shall be permitted. Internees who work shall receive additional rations in proportion to the kind of labour which they perform. Expectant and nursing mothers, and children under fifteen years of age, shall be given additional food, in proportion to their physiological needs.  

### Article  90  

When taken into custody, internees shall be given all facilities to provide themselves with the necessary clothing, footwear and change of underwear, and later on, to procure further supplies if required. Should any internees not have sufficient clothing, account being taken of the climate, and be unable to procure any, it shall be provided free of charge to them by the Detaining Power. The clothing supplied by the Detaining Power to internees and the outward markings placed on their own clothes shall not be ignominious nor expose them to ridicule. Workers shall receive suitable working outfits, including protective clothing, whenever the nature of their work so requires.  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####HYGIENE AND MEDICAL ATTENTION

### Article  91  

Every place of internment shall have an adequate infirmary, under the direction of a qualified doctor, where internees may have the attention they require, as well as an appropriate diet. Isolation wards shall be set aside for cases of contagious or mental diseases. Maternity cases and internees suffering from serious diseases, or whose condition requires special treatment, a surgical operation or hospital care, must be admitted to any institution where adequate treatment can be given and shall receive care not inferior to that provided for the general population. Internees shall, for preference, have the attention of medical personnel of their own nationality. Internees may not be prevented from presenting themselves to the medical authorities for examination. The medical authorities of the Detaining Power shall, upon request, issue to every internee who has undergone treatment an official certificate showing the nature of his illness or injury, are the duration and nature of the treatment given. A duplicate of this certificate shall be forwarded to the Central Agency provided for in Article 140. Treatment, including the provision of any apparatus necessary for the maintenance of internees in good health, particularly dentures and other artificial appliances and spectacles, shall be free of charge to the internee.  

### Article  92  

Medical inspections of internees shall be made at least once a month. Their purpose shall be, in particular, to supervise the general state of health, nutrition and cleanliness of internees, and to detect contagious diseases, especially tuberculosis, malaria, and venereal diseases. Such inspections shall include, in particular, the checking of weight of each internee and, at least once a year, radioscopic examination.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####RELIGIOUS, INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES

### Article  93  

Internees shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties, including attendance at the services of their faith, on condition that they comply with the disciplinary routine prescribed by the detaining authorities. Ministers of religion who are interned shall be allowed to minister freely to the members of their community. For this purpose, the Detaining Power shall ensure their equitable allocation amongst the various places of internment in which there are internees speaking the same language and belonging to the same religion. Should such ministers be too few in number, the Detaining Power shall provide them with the necessary facilities, including means of transport, for moving from one place to another, and they shall be authorized to visit any internees who are in hospital. Ministers of religion shall be at liberty to correspond on matters concerning their ministry with the religious authorities in the country of detention and, as far as possible, with the international religious organizations of their faith. Such correspondence shall not be considered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 107. It shall, however, be subject to the provisions of Article 112. When internees do not have at their disposal the assistance of ministers of their faith, or should these latter be too few in number, the local religious authorities of the same faith may appoint, in agreement with the Detaining Power, a minister of the internees' faith or, if such a course is feasible from a denominational point of view, a minister of similar religion or a qualified layman. The latter shall enjoy the facilities granted to the ministry he has assumed. Persons so appointed shall comply with all regulations laid down by the Detaining Power in the interests of discipline and security.  

### Article  94  

The Detaining Power shall encourage intellectual, educational and recreational pursuits, sports and games amongst internees, whilst leaving them free to take part in them or not. It shall take all practicable measures to ensure the exercise thereof, in particular by providing suitable premises. All possible facilities shall be granted to internees to continue their studies or to take up new subjects. The education of children and young people shall be ensured; they shall be allowed to attend schools either within the place of internment or outside. Internees shall be given opportunities for physical exercise, sports and outdoor games. For this purpose, sufficient open spaces shall be set aside in all places of internment. Special playgrounds shall be reserved for children and young people.  

### Article  95  

The Detaining Power shall not employ internees as workers, unless they so desire. Employment which, if undertaken under compulsion by a protected person not in internment, would involve a breach of Articles 40 or 51 of the present Convention, and employment on work which is of a degrading or humiliating character are in any case prohibited. After a working period of six weeks, internees shall be free to give up work at any moment, subject to eight days' notice. These provisions constitute no obstacle to the right of the Detaining Power to employ interned doctors, dentists and other medical personnel in their professional capacity on behalf of their fellow internees, or to employ internees for administrative and maintenance work in places of internment and to detail such persons for work in the kitchens or for other domestic tasks, or to require such persons to undertake duties connected with the protection of internees against aerial bombardment or other war risks. No internee may, however, be required to perform tasks for which he is, in the opinion of a medical officer, physically unsuited. The Detaining Power shall take entire responsibility for all working conditions, for medical attention, for the payment of wages, and for ensuring that all employed internees receive compensation for occupational accidents and diseases. The standards prescribed for the said working conditions and for compensation shall be in accordance with the national laws and regulations, and with the existing practice; they shall in no case be inferior to those obtaining for work of the same nature in the same district. Wages for work done shall be determined on an equitable basis by special agreements between the internees, the Detaining Power, and, if the case arises, employers other than the Detaining Power, due regard being paid to the obligation of the Detaining Power to provide for free maintenance of internees and for the medical attention which their state of health may require. Internees permanently detailed for categories of work mentioned in the third paragraph of this Article, shall be paid fair wages by the Detaining Power. The working conditions and the scale of compensation for occupational accidents and diseases to internees thus detailed, shall not be inferior to those applicable to work of the same nature in the same district.  

### Article  96  

All labour detachments shall remain part of and dependent upon a place of internment. The competent authorities of the Detaining Power and the commandant of a place of internment shall be responsible for the observance in a labour detachment of the provisions of the present Convention. The commandant shall keep an up-to-date list of the labour detachments subordinate to him and shall communicate it to the delegates of the Protecting Power, of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of other humanitarian organizations who may visit the places of internment.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####PERSONAL PROPERTY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

### Article  97  

Internees shall be permitted to retain articles of personal use. Monies, cheques, bonds, etc., and valuables in their possession may not be taken from them except in accordance with established procedure. Detailed receipts shall be given therefor. The amounts shall be paid into the account of every internee as provided for in Article 98. Such amounts may not be converted into any other currency unless legislation in force in the territory in which the owner is interned so requires or the internee gives his consent. Articles which have above all a personal or sentimental value may not be taken away. A woman internee shall not be searched except by a woman. On release or repatriation, internees shall be given all articles, monies or other valuables taken from them during internment and shall receive in currency the balance of any credit to their accounts kept in accordance with Article 98, with the exception of any articles or amounts withheld by the Detaining Power by virtue of its legislation in force. If the property of an internee is so withheld, the owner shall receive a detailed receipt. Family or identity documents in the possession of internees may not be taken away without a receipt being given. At no time shall internees be left without identity documents. If they have none, they shall be issued with special documents drawn up by the detaining authorities, which will serve as their identity papers until the end of their internment. Internees may keep on their persons a certain amount of money, in cash or in the shape of purchase coupons, to enable them to make purchases.  

### Article  98  

All internees shall receive regular allowances, sufficient to enable them to purchase goods and articles, such as tobacco, toilet requisites, etc. Such allowances may take the form of credits or purchase coupons. Furthermore, internees may receive allowances from the Power to which they owe allegiance, the Protecting Powers, the organizations which may assist them, or their families, as well as the income on their property in accordance with the law of the Detaining Power. The amount of allowances granted by the Power to which they owe allegiance shall be the same for each category of internees (infirm, sick, pregnant women, etc.), but may not be allocated by that Power or distributed by the Detaining Power on the basis of discriminations between internees which are prohibited by Article 27 of the present Convention. The Detaining Power shall open a regular account for every internee, to which shall be credited the allowances named in the present Article, the wages earned and the remittances received, together with such sums taken from him as may be available under the legislation in force in the territory in which he is interned. Internees shall be granted all facilities consistent with the legislation in force in such territory to make remittances to their families and to other dependants. They may draw from their accounts the amounts necessary for their personal expenses, within the limits fixed by the Detaining Power. They shall at all times be afforded reasonable facilities for consulting and obtaining copies of their accounts. A statement of accounts shall be furnished to the Protecting Power on request, and shall accompany the internee in case of transfer.  

### CHAPTER  VII  

####ADMINISTRATION AND DISCIPLINE

### Article  99  

Every place of internment shall be put under the authority of a responsible officer, chosen from the regular military forces or the regular civil administration of the Detaining Power. The officer in charge of the place of internment must have in his possession a copy of the present Convention in the official language, or one of the official languages, of his country and shall be responsible for its application. The staff in control of internets shall be instructed in the provisions of the present Convention and of the administrative measures adopted to ensure its application. The text of the present Convention and the texts of special agreements concluded under the said Convention shall be posted inside the place of internment, in a language which the internees understand, or shall be in the possession of the Internee Committee. Regulations, orders, notices and publications of every kind shall be communicated to the internees and posted inside the places of internment, in a language which they understand. Every order and command addressed to internees individually, must likewise, be given in a language which they understand.  

### Article  100  

The disciplinary regime in places of internment shall be consistent with humanitarian principles, and shall in no circumstances include regulations imposing on internees any physical exertion dangerous to their health or involving physical or moral victimization. Identification by tattooing or imprinting signs or markings on the body, is prohibited. In particular, prolonged standing and roll-calls, punishment drill, military drill and manoeuvres, or the reduction of food rations, are prohibited.  

### Article  101  

Internees shall have the right to present to the authorities in whose power they are, any petition with regard to the conditions of internment to which they are subjected. They shall also have the right to apply without restriction through the Internee Committee or, if they consider it necessary, direct to the representatives of the Protecting Power, in order to indicate to them any points on which they may have complaints to make with regard to the conditions of internment. Such petitions and complaints shall be transmitted forthwith and without alteration, and even if the latter are recognized to be unfounded, they may not occasion any punishment. Periodic reports on the situation in places of internment and as to the needs of the internees, may be sent by the Internee Committees to the representatives of the Protecting Powers.  

### Article  102  

In every place of internment, the internees shall freely elect by secret ballot every six months, the members of a Committee empowered to represent them before the Detaining and the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and any other organization which may assist them. The members of the Committee shall be eligible for re-election. Internees so elected shall enter upon their duties after their election has been approved by the detaining authorities. The reasons for any refusals or dismissals shall be communicated to the Protecting Powers concerned.  

### Article  103  

The Internee Committees shall further the physical, spiritual and intellectual well-being of the internees. In case the internees decide, in particular, to organize a system of mutual assistance amongst themselves, this organization would be within the competence of the Committees in addition to the special duties entrusted to them under other provisions of the present Convention.  

### Article  104  

Members of Internee Committees shall not be required to perform any other work, if the accomplishment of their duties is rendered more difficult thereby. Members of Internee Committees may appoint from amongst the internees such assistants as they may require. All material facilities shall be granted to them, particularly a certain freedom of movement necessary for the accomplishment of their duties (visits to labour detachments, receipt of supplies, etc.). All facilities shall likewise be accorded to members of Internee Committees for communication by post and telegraph with the detaining authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and their delegates, and with the organizations which give assistance to internees. Committee members in labour detachments shall enjoy similar facilities for communication with their Internee Committee in the principal place of internment. Such communications shall not be limited, nor considered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 107. Members of Internee Committees who are transferred shall be allowed a reasonable time to acquaint their successors with current affairs.  

### CHAPTER  VIII  

####RELATIONS WITH THE EXTERIOR

### Article  105  

Immediately upon interning protected persons, the Detaining Powers shall inform them, the Power to which they owe allegiance and their Protecting Power of the measures taken for executing the provisions of the present Chapter. The Detaining Powers shall likewise inform the Parties concerned of any subsequent modifications of such measures.  

### Article  106  

As soon as he is interned, or at the latest not more than one week after his arrival in a place of internment, and likewise in cases of sickness or transfer to another place of internment or to a hospital, every internee shall be enabled to send direct to his family, on the one hand, and to the Central Agency provided for by Article 140, on the other, an internment card similar, if possible, to the model annexed to the present Convention, informing his relatives of his detention, address and state of health. The said cards shall be forwarded as rapidly as possible and may not be delayed in any way.  

### Article  107  

Internees shall be allowed to send and receive letters and cards. If the Detaining Power deems it necessary to limit the number of letters and cards sent by each internee, the said number shall not be less than two letters and four cards monthly; these shall be drawn up so as to conform as closely as possible to the models annexed to the present Convention. If limitations must be placed on the correspondence addressed to internees, they may be ordered only by the Power to which such internees owe allegiance, possibly at the request of the Detaining Power. Such letters and cards must be conveyed with reasonable despatch; they may not be delayed or retained for disciplinary reasons. Internees who have been a long time without news, or who find it impossible to receive news from their relatives, or to give them news by the ordinary postal route, as well as those who are at a considerable distance from their homes, shall be allowed to send telegrams, the charges being paid by them in the currency at their disposal. They shall likewise benefit by this provision in cases which are recognized to be urgent. As a rule, internees' mail shall be written in their own language. The Parties to the conflict may authorize correspondence in other languages.  

### Article  108  

Internees shall be allowed to receive, by post or by any other means, individual parcels or collective shipments containing in particular foodstuffs, clothing, medical supplies, as well as books and objects of a devotional, educational or recreational character which may meet their needs. Such shipments shall in no way free the Detaining Power from the obligations imposed upon it by virtue of the present Convention. Should military necessity require the quantity of such shipments to be limited, due notice thereof shall be given to the Protecting Power and to the International Committee of the Red Cross, or to any other organization giving assistance to the internees and responsible for the forwarding of such shipments. The conditions for the sending of individual parcels and collective shipments shall, if necessary, be the subject of special agreements between the Powers concerned, which may in no case delay the receipt by the internees of relief supplies. Parcels of clothing and foodstuffs may not include books. Medical relief supplies shall, as a rule, be sent in collective parcels.  

### Article  109  

In the absence of special agreements between Parties to the conflict regarding the conditions for the receipt and distribution of collective relief shipments, the regulations concerning collective relief which are annexed to the present Convention shall be applied. The special agreements provided for above shall in no case restrict the right of Internee Comittees to take possession of collective relief shipments intended for internees, to undertake their distribution and to. dispose of them in the interests of the recipients. Nor shall such agreements restrict the right of representatives of the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross, or any other organization giving assistance to internees and responsible for the forwarding of collective shipments, to supervise their distribution to the recipients.  

### Article  110  

All relief shipments for internees shall be exempt from import, customs and other dues. All matter sent by mail, including relief parcels sent by parcel post and remittances of money, addressed from other countries to internees or despatched by them through the post office, either direct or through the Information Bureaux provided for in Article 136 and the Central Information Agency provided for in Article 140, shall be exempt from all postal dues both in the countries of origin and destination and in intermediate countries. To this end, in particular, the exemption provided by the Universal Postal Convention of 1947 and by the agreements of the World Postal Union in favour of civilians of enemy nationality detained in camps or civilian prisons, shall be extended to the other interned persons protected by the present Convention. The countries not signatory to the above-mentioned agreements shall be bound to grant freedom from charges in the same circumstances. The cost of transporting relief shipments which are intended for internees and which, by reason of their weight or any other cause, cannot be sent through the post office, shall be borne by the Detaining Power in all the territories under its control. Other Powers which are Parties to the present Convention shall bear the cost of transport in their respective territories. Costs connected with the transport of such shipments, which are not covered by the above paragraphs, shall be charged to the senders. The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reduce, so far as possible, the charges for telegrams sent by internees, or addressed to them.  

### Article  111  

Should military operations prevent the Powers concerned from fulfilling their obligation to ensure the conveyance of the mail and relief shipments provided for in Article 106, 107, 108 and 113, the Protecting Powers concerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization duly approved by the Parties to the conflict may undertake the conveyance of such shipments by suitable means (rail, motor vehicles, vessels or aircraft, etc.). For this purpose, the High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to supply them with such transport, and to allow its circulation, especially by granting the necessary safe-conducts. Such transport may also be used to convey: 

(a) correspondence, lists and reports exchanged between the Central Information Agency referred to in Article 140 and the National Bureaux referred to in Article 136;  

(b) correspondence and reports relating to internees which the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization assisting the internees exchange either with their own delegates or with the Parties to the conflict.   These provisions in no way detract from the right of any Party to the conflict to arrange other means of transport if it should so prefer, nor preclude the granting of safe-conducts, under mutually agreed conditions, to such means of transport. The costs occasioned by the use of such means of transport shall be borne, in proportion to the importance of the shipments, by the Parties to the conflict whose nationals are benefited thereby.  

### Article  112  

The censoring of correspondence addressed to internees or despatched by them shall be done as quickly as possible. The examination of consignments intended for internees shall not be carried out under conditions that will expose the goods contained in them to deterioration. It shall be done in the presence of the addressee, or of a fellow-internee duly delegated by him. The delivery to internees of individual or collective consignments shall not be delayed under the pretext of difficulties of censorship. Any prohibition of correspondence ordered by the Parties to the conflict either for military or political reasons, shall be only temporary and its duration shall be as short as possible.  

### Article  113  

The Detaining Powers shall provide all reasonable facilities for the transmission, through the Protecting Power or the Central Agency provided for in Article 140, or as otherwise required, of wills, powers of attorney, letters of authority, or any other documents intended for internees or despatched by them. In all cases the Detaining Powers shall facilitate the execution and authentication in due legal form of such documents on behalf of internees, in particular by allowing them to consult a lawyer.  

### Article  114  

The Detaining Power shall afford internees all facilities to enable them to manage their property, provided this is not incompatible with the conditions of internment and the law which is applicable. For this purpose, the said Power may give them permission to leave the place of internment in urgent cases and if circumstances allow.  

### Article  115  

In all cases where an internee is a party to proceedings in any court, the Detaining Power shall, if he so requests, cause the court to be informed of his detention and shall, within legal limits, ensure that all necessary steps are taken to prevent him from being in any way prejudiced, by reason of his internment, as regards the preparation and conduct of his case or as regards the execution of any judgment of the court.  

### Article  116  

Every internee shall be allowed to receive visitors, especially near relatives, at regular intervals and as frequently as possible. As far as is possible, internees shall be permitted to visit their homes in urgent cases, particularly in cases of death or serious illness of relatives.  

### CHAPTER  IX  

####PENAL AND DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS

### Article  117  

Subject to the provisions of the present Chapter, the laws in force in the territory in which they are detained will continue to apply to internees who commit offences during internment. If general laws, regulations or oiders declare acts committed by internees to be punishable, whereas the same acts are not punishable when committed by persons who are not internees, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only. No internee may be punished more than once for the same act, or on the same count.  

### Article  118  

The courts or authorities shall in passing sentence take as far as possible into account the fact that the defendant is not a national of the Detaining Power. They shall be free to reduce the penalty prescribed for the offence with which the internee is charged and shall not be obliged, to this end, to apply the minimum sentence prescribed. Imprisonment in premises without daylight and, in general, ail forms of cruelty without exception are forbidden. Internees who have served disciplinary or judicial sentences shall not be treated differently from other internees. The duration of preventive detention undergone by an internee shall be deducted from any disciplinary or judicial penalty involving confinement to which he may be sentenced. Internee Committees shall be informed of all judicial proceedings instituted against internees whom they represent, and of their result.  

### Article  119  

The disciplinary punishments applicable to internees shall be the following: 

(1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 per cent of the wages which the internee would otherwise receive under the provisions of Article 95 during a period of not more than thirty days.  

(2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above the treatment provided for by the present Convention.  

(3) Fatigue duties, not exceeding two hours daily, in connection with the maintenance of the place of internment.  

(4) Confinement.   In no case shall disciplinary penalties be inhuman, brutal or dangerous for the health of internees. Account shall be taken of the internee's age, sex and state of health. The duration of any single punishment shall in no case exceed a maximum of thirty consecutive days, even if the internee is answerable for several breaches of discipline when his case is dealt with, whether such breaches are connected or not.  

### Article  120  

Internees who are recaptured after having escaped or when attempting to escape, shall be liable only to disciplinary punishment in respect of this act, even if it is a repeated offence. Article 118, paragraph 3, notwithstanding, internees punished as a result of escape or attempt to escape, may be subjected to special surveillance, on condition that such surveillance does not affect the state of their health, that it is exercised in a place of internment and that it does not entail the abolition of any of the safeguards granted by the present Convention. Internees who aid and abet an escape or attempt to escape, shall be liable on this count to disciplinary punishment only.  

### Article  121  

Escape, or attempt to escape, even if it is a repeated offence, shall not be deemed an aggravating circumstance in cases where an internee is prosecuted for offences committed during his escape. The Parties to the conflict shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise leniency in deciding whether punishment inflicted for an offence shall be of a disciplinary or judicial nature, especially in respect of acts committed in connection with an escape, whether succesful or not.  

### Article  122  

Acts which constitute offences against discipline shall be investigated immediately. This rule shall be applied, in particular, in cases of escape or attempt to escape. Recaptured internees shall be handed over to the competent authorities as soon as possible. In case of offences against discipline, confinement awaiting trial shall be reduced to an absolute minimum for all internees, and shall not exceed fourteen days. Its duration shall in any case be deducted from any sentence of confinement. The provisions of Articles 124 and 125 shall apply to internees who are in confinement awaiting trial for offences against discipline.  

### Article  123  

Without prejudice to the competence of courts and higher authorities, disciplinary punishment may be ordered only by the commandant of the place of internment, or by a responsible officer or official who replaces him, or to whom he has delegated his disciplinary powers. Before any disciplinary punishment is awarded, the accused internee shall be given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He shall be permitted, in particular, to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to the services of a qualified interpreter. The decision shall be announced in the presence of the accused and of a member of the Internee Committee. The period elapsing between the time of award of a disciplinary punishment and its execution shall not exceed one month. When an internee is awarded a further disciplinary punishment, a period of at least three days shall elapse between the execution of any two of the punishments, if the duration of one of these is ten days or more. A record of disciplinary punishments shall be maintained by the commandant of the place of internment and shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting Power.  

### Article  124  

Internees shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments (prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons, etc.) to undergo disciplinary punishment therein. The premises in which disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform to sanitary requirements; they shall in particular be provided with adequate bedding. Internees undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep themselves in a state of cleanliness. Women internees undergoing disciplinary punishment shall be confined in separate quarters from male internees and shall be under the immediate supervision of women.  

### Article  125  

Internees awarded disciplinary punishment shall be allowed to exercise and to stay in the open air at least two hours daily. They shall be allowed, if they so request, to be present at the daily medical inspections. They shall receive the attention which their state of health requires and, if necessary, shall be removed to the infirmary of the place of internment or to a hospital. They shall have permission to read and write, likewise to send and receive letters. Parcels and remittances of money, however, may be withheld from them until the completion of their punishment; such consignments shall meanwhile be entrusted to the Internee Committee, who will hand over to the infirmary the perishable goods contained in the parcels. No internee given a disciplinary punishment may be deprived of the benefit of the provisions of Articles 107 and 143 of the present Convention.  

### Article  126  

The provisions of Articles 71 to 76 inclusive shall apply, by analogy, to proceedings against internees who are in the national territory of the Detaining Power.  

### CHAPTER  X  

####TRANSFERS OF INTERNEES

### Article  127  

The transfer of internees shall always be effected humanely. As a general rule, it shall be carried out by rail or other means of transport, and under conditions at least equal to those obtaining for the forces of the Detaining Power in their changes of station. If, as an exceptional measure, such removals have to be effected on foot, they may not take place unless the internees are in a fit state of health, and may not in any case expose them to excessive fatigue. The Detaining Power shall supply internees during transfer with drinking water and food sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to maintain them in good health, and also with the necessary clothing, adequate shelter and the necessary medical attention. The Detaining Power shall take all suitable precautions to ensure their safety during transfer, and shall establish before their departure a complete list of all internees transferred. Sick, wounded or infirm internees and maternity cases shall not be transferred if the journey would be seriously detrimental to them, unless their safety imperatively so demands. If the combat zone draws close to a place of internment, the internees in the said place shall not be transferred unless their removal can be carried out in adequate conditions of safety, or unless they are exposed to greater risks by remaining on the spot than by being transferred. When making decisions regarding the transfer of internees, the Detaining Power shall take their interests into account and, in particular, shall not do anything to increase the difficulties of repatriating them or returning them to their own homes.  

### Article  128  

In the event of transfer, internees shall be officially advised of their departure and of their new postal address. Such notification shall be given in time for them to pack their luggage and inform their next of kin. They shall be allowed to take with them their personal effects, and the correspondence and parcels which have arrived for them. The weight of such baggage may be limited if the conditions of transfer so require, but in no case to less than twenty-five kilograms per internee. Mail and parcels addressed to their former place of internment shall be forwarded to them without delay. The commandant of the place of internment shall take, in agreement with the Internee Committee, any measures needed to ensure the transport of the internees' community property and of the luggage the internees are unable to take with them in consequence of restrictions imposed by virtue of the second paragraph.  

### CHAPTER  XI  

####DEATHS

### Article  129  

The wills of internees shall be received for safe-keeping by the responsible authorities; and in the event of the death of an internee his will shall be transmitted without delay to a person whom he has previously designated. Deaths of internees shall be certified in every case by a doctor, and a death certificate shall be made out, showing the causes of death and the conditions under which it occurred. An official record of the death, duly registered, shall be drawn up in accordance with the procedure relating thereto in force in the territory where the place of internment is situated, and a duly certified copy of such record shall be transmitted without delay to the Protecting Power as well as to the Central Agency referred to in Article 140.  

### Article  130  

The detaining authorities shall ensure that internees who die while interned are honourably buried, if possible according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged, and that their graves are respected, properly maintained, and marked in such a way that they can always be recognized. Deceased internees shall be buried in individual graves unless unavoidable circumstances require the use of collective graves. Bodies may be cremated only for imperative reasons of hygiene, on account of the religion of the deceased or in accordance with his expressed wish to this effect. In case of cremation, the fact shall be stated and the reasons given in the death certificate of the deceased. The ashes shall be retained for safe-keeping by the detaining authorities and shall be transferred as soon as possible to the next of kin on their request. As soon as circumstances permit, and not later than the close of hostilities, the Detaining Power shall forward lists of graves of deceased internees to the Powers on whom deceased internees depended, through the Information Bureaux provided for in Article 136. Such lists shall include all particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased internees, as well as the exact location of their graves.  

### Article  131  

Every death or serious injury of an internee, caused or suspected to have been caused by a sentry, another internee or any other person, as well as any death the cause of which is unknown, shall be immediately followed by an official enquiry by the Detaining Power. A communication on this subject shall be sent immediately to the Protecting Power. The evidence of any witnesses shall be taken, and a report including such evidence shall be prepared and forwarded to the said Protecting Power. If the enquiry indicates the guilt of one or more persons, the Detaining Power shall take all necessary steps to ensure the prosecution of the person or persons responsible.  

### CHAPTER  XII  

####RELEASE, REPATRIATION AND ACCOMMODATION IN NEUTRAL COUNTRIES

### Article  132  

Each interned person shall be released by the Detaining Power as soon as the reasons which necessitated his internment no longer exist. The Parties to the conflict shall, moreover, endeavour during the course of hostilities, to conclude agreements for the release, the repatriation, the return to places of residence or the accommodation in a neutral country of certain classes of internees, in particular children, pregnant women and mothers with infants and young children, wounded and sick, and internees who have been detained for a long time.  

### Article  133  

Internment shall cease as soon as possible after the close of hostilities. Internees in the territory of a Party to the conflict against whom penal proceedings are pending for offences not exclusively subject to disciplinary penalties, may be detained until the close of such proceedings and, if circumstances require, until the completion of the penalty. The same shall apply to internees who have been previously sentenced to a punishment depriving them of liberty. By agreement between the Detaining Power and the Powers concerned, committees may be set up after the close of hostilities, or of the occupation of territories, to search for dispersed internees.  

### Article  134  

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour, upon the close of hostilities or occupation, to ensure the return of all internees to their last place of residence, or to facilitate their repatriation.  

### Article  135  

The Detaining Power shall bear the expense of returning released internees to the places where they were residing when interned, or, if it took them into custody while they were in transit or on the high seas, the cost of completing their journey or of their return to their point of departure. Where a Detaining Power refuses permission to reside in its territory to a released internee who previously had his permanent domicile therein, such Detaining Power shall pay the cost of the said internee's repatriation. If, however, the internee elects to return to his country on his own responsibility or in obedience to the Government of the Power to which he owes allegiance, the Detaining Power need not pay the expenses of his journey beyond the point of his departure from its territory. The Detaining Power need not pay the costs of repatriation of an internee who was interned at his own request. If internees are transferred in accordance with Article 45, the transferring and receiving Powers shall agree on the portion of the above costs to be borne by each. The foregoing shall not prejudice such special agreements as may be concluded between Parties to the conflict concerning the exchange and repatriation of their nationals in enemy hands.  

### SECTION  V  

####INFORMATION BUREAUX AND CENTRAL AGENCY

### Article  136  

Upon the outbreak of a conflit and in all cases of occupation, each of the Parties to the conflict shall establish an official Information Bureau responsible for receiving and transmitting information in respect of the protected persons who are in its power. Each of the Parties to the conflict shall, within the shortest possible period, give its Bureau information of any measure taken by it concerning any protected persons who are kept in custody for more than two weeks, who are subjected to assigned residence or who are interned. It shall, furthermore, require its various departments concerned with such matters to provide the aforesaid Bureau promptly with information concerning all changes pertaining to these protected persons, as, for example, transfers, releases, repatriations, escapes, admittances to hospitals, births and deaths.  

### Article  137  

Each national Bureau shall immediately forward information concerning protected persons by the most rapid means to the Powers of whom the aforesaid persons are nationals, or to Powers in whose territory they resided, through the intermediary of the Protecting Powers and likewise through the Central Agency provided for in Article 140. The Bureaux shall also reply to all enquiries which may be received regarding protected persons. Information Bureaux shall transmit information concerning a protected person unless its transmission might be detrimental to the person concerned or to his or her relatives. Even in such a case, the information may not be withheld from the Central Agency which, upon being notified of the circumstances, will take the necessary precautions indicated in Article 140. All communications in writing made by any Bureau shall be authenticated by a signature or a seal.  

### Article  138  

The information received by the national Bureau and transmitted by it shall be of such a character as to make it possible to identify the protected person exactly and to advise his next of kin quickly. The information in respect of each person shall include at least his surname, first names, place and date of birth, nationality, last residence and distinguishing characteristics, the first name of the father and the maiden name of the mother, the date, place and nature of the action taken with regard to the individual, the address at which correspondence may be sent to him and the name and address of the person to be informed. Likewise, information regarding the state of health of internees who are seriously ill or seriously wounded shall be supplied regularly and if possible every week.  

### Article  139  

Each national Information Bureau shall, furthermore, be responsible for collecting all personal valuables left by protected persons mentioned in Article 136, in particular those who have been repatriated or released, or who have escaped or died; it shall forward the said valuables to those concerned, either direct, or, if necessary, through the Central Agency. Such articles shall be sent by the Bureau in sealed packets which shall be accompanied by statements giving clear and full identity particulars of the person to whom the articles belonged, and by a complete list of the contents of the parcel. Detailed records shall be maintained of the receipt and despatch of all such valuables.  

### Article  140  

A Central Information Agency for protected persons, in particular for internees, shall be created in a neutral country. The International Committee of the Red Cross shall, if it deems necessary, propose to the Powers concerned the organization of such an Agency, which may be the same as that provided for in Article 123 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. The function of the Agency shall be to collect all information of the type set forth in Article 136 which it may obtain through official or private channels and to transmit it as rapidly as possible to the countries of origin or of residence of the persons concerned, except in cases where such transmissions might be detrimental to the persons whom the said information concerns, or to their relatives. It shall receive from the Parties to the conflict all reasonable facilities for effecting such transmissions. The High Contracting Parties, and in particular those whose nationals benefit by the services of the Central Agency, are requested to give the said Agency the financial aid it may require. The foregoing provisions shall in no way be interpreted as restricting the humanitarian activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the relief societies described in Article 142.  

### Article  141  

The national Information Bureaux and the Central Information Agency shall enjoy free postage for all mail, likewise the exemptions provided for in Article 110, and further, so far as possible, exemption from telegrapnic charges or, at least, greatly reduced rates.  

### PART  IV  

####EXECUTION OF THE CONVENTION

### SECTION  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  142  

Subject to the measures which the Detaining Powers may consider essential to ensure their security or to meet any other reasonable need, the representatives of religious organizations, relief societies, or any other organizations assisting the protected persons, shall receive from these Powers, for themselves or their duly accredited agents, all facilities for visiting the protected persons, for distributing relief supplies and material from any source, intended for educational, recreational or religious purposes, or for assisting them in organizing their leisure time within the places of internment. Such societies or organizations may be constituted in the territory of the Detaining Power, or in any other country, or they may have an international character. The Detaining Power may limit the number of societies and organizations whose delegates are allowed to carry out their activities in its territory and under its supervision, on condition, however, that such limitation shall not hinder the supply of effective and adequate relief to all protected persons. The special position of the International Committee of the Red Cross in this field shall be recognized and respected at all times.  

### Article  143  

Representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall have permission to go to all places where protected persons are, particularly to places of internment, detention and work. They shall have access to ail premises occupied by protected persons and shall be able to interview the latter without witnesses, personally or through an interpreter. Such visits may not be prohibited except for reasons of imperative military necessity, and then only as an exceptional and temporary measure. Their duration and frequency shall not be restricted. Such representatives and delegates shall have full liberty to select the places they wish to visit. The Detaining or Occupying Power, the Protecting Power and when occasion arises the Power of origin of the persons to be visited, may agree that compatriots of the internees shall be permitted to participate in the visits.

The appointment of such delegates shall be submitted to the approval of the Power governing the territories where they will carry out their duties.  

### Article  144

It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party has made out a *prima facie* case. Each High Contracting Party sbal take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other than the grave breaches defined in the following Article.

### Article  149  

At the request of a Party to the conflict, an enquiry shall be instituted, in a manner to be decided between the interested Parties, concerning any alleged violation of the Convention. If agreement has not been reached concerning the procedure for the enquiry, the Parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the procedure to be followed.

### Article  2  

The distribution of collective relief shipments shall be effected in accordance with the instructions of the donors and with a plan drawn up by the Internee Committees. The issue of medical stores shall, however, be made for preference in agreement with the senior medical officers, and the latter may, in hospitals and infirmaries, waive the said instructions, if the needs of their patients so demand. Within the limits thus defined, the distribution shall always be carried out equitably.  

### Article  3  

Members of Internee Committees shall be allowed to go to the railway stations or other points of arrival of relief supplies near their places of internment so as to enable them to verify the quantity as well as the quality of the goods received and to make out detailed reports thereon for the donors.  

### Article  4  

Internee Committees shall be given the facilities necessary for verifying whether the distribution of collective relief in all subdivisions and annexes of their places of internment has been carried out in accordance with their instructions.  

### Article  5  

Internee Committees shall be allowed to complete, and to cause to be completed by members of the Internee Committees in labour detachments or by the senior medical officers of infirmaries and hospitals, forms or questionnaires intended for the donors, relating to collective relief supplies (distribution, requirements, quantities, etc.). Such forms and questionnaires, duly completed, shall be forwarded to the donors without delay.  

### Article  6  

In order to secure the regular distribution of collective relief supplies to the internees in their place of internment, and to meet any needs that may arise through the arrival of fresh parties of internees, the Internee Committees shall be allowed to create and maintain sufficient reserve stocks of collective relief. For this purpose, they shall have suitable warehouses at their disposal; each warehouse shall be provided with two locks, the Internee Committee holding the keys of one lock, and the commandant of the place of internment the keys of the other.

They shall likewise facilitate the transfer of funds and other financial measures of a technical or administrative nature taken for the purpose of making such purchases.  

### Article  8  

The foregoing provisions shall not constitute an obstacle to the right of internees to receive collective relief before their arrival in a place of internment or in the course of their transfer, nor to the possibility of representatives of the Protecting Power, or of the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other humanitarian organization giving assistance to internees and responsible for forwarding such supplies, ensuring the distribution thereof to the recipients by any other means they may deem suitable.

####Verdrag van Genève betreffende de bescherming van burgers in oorlogstijd, van 12 Augustus 1949

De ondergetekenden, Gevolmachtigden van de Regeringen, vertegenwoordigd op de Diplomatieke Conferentie welke te Genève van 21 April tot 12 Augustus 1949 is bijeengekomen voor het opstellen van een Verdrag voor de bescherming van burgers in oorlogstijd, zijn het volgende overgekomen:    

### TITEL  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  1  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich dit Verdrag onder alle omstandigheden te eerbiedigen en te doen eerbiedigen.  

### Artikel  2  

Onverminderd de bepalingen welke reeds in tijd van vrede in werking moeten treden, is dit Verdrag van toepassing ingeval een oorlog is verklaard of bij ieder ander gewapend conflict dat ontstaat tussen twee of meer der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, zelfs indien de oorlogstoestand door één der Partijen niet wordt erkend. Het Verdrag is eveneens van toepassing in alle gevallen van gehele of gedeeltelijke bezetting van het grondgebied van een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, zelfs indien deze bezetting geen gewapende tegenstand ontmoet. Indien één der in conflict zijnde Mogendheden geen partij is bij dit Verdrag, blijven de Mogendheden die wel partij zijn, niettemin in haar onderlinge betrekkingen hierdoor gebonden. Bovendien zullen zij door het Verdrag gebonden zijn ten opzichte van bedoelde Mogendheid, indien deze de bepalingen daarvan aanvaardt en toepast.  

### Artikel  3  

In geval van een gewapend conflict op het grondgebied van één der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, hetwelk geen internationaal karakter draagt, is ieder der Partijen bij het conflict gehouden ten minste de volgende bepalingen toe te passen: 

1. Personen die niet rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deelnemen, met inbegrip van personeel van strijdkrachten dat de wapens heeft nedergelegd, en zij die buiten gevecht zijn gesteld door ziekte, verwonding, gevangenschap of enige andere oorzaak, moeten onder alle omstandigheden menslievend worden behandeld, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond op ras, huidkleur, godsdienst of geloof, geslacht, geboorte of maatschappelijke welstand of enig ander soortgelijk criterium. Te dien einde zijn en blijven te allen tijde en overal ten aanzien van bovengenoemde personen verboden: 

a. aanslag op het leven en lichamelijke geweldpleging, in het bijzonder het doden op welke wijze ook, verminking, wrede behandeling en marteling;  

b. het nemen van gijzelaars;  

c. aanranding van de persoonlijke waardigheid, in het bijzonder vernederende en onterende behandeling;  

d. het uitspreken en tenuitvoerleggen van vonnissen zonder voorafgaande berechting door een op regelmatige wijze samengesteld gerecht dat alle gerechtelijke waarborgen biedt, door de beschaafde volken als onmisbaar erkend.    

2. De gewonden en zieken moeten worden verzameld en verzorgd.   Een onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, kan haar diensten aan de Partijen bij het conflict aanbieden. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen er verder naar streven door middel van bijzondere overeenkomsten de andere of een deel der andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag van kracht te doen worden. De toepassing van bovenstaande bepalingen zal niet van invloed zijn op de juridische status van de Partijen bij het conflict.  

### Artikel  4  

Dit Verdrag beschermt personen die, op welk tijdstip en op welke wijze ook, in geval van een conflict of bezetting, zich in de macht bevinden van een Partij bij het conflict of van een bezettende Mogendheid, van welke zij geen onderdanen zijn. Onderdanen van een Staat die niet gebonden is door het Verdrag, worden hierdoor niet beschermd. Onderdanen van een onzijdige Staat, die zich bevinden op het grondgebied van een oorlogvoerende Staat, en onderdanen van een mede-oorlogvoerende Staat worden niet als beschermde personen beschouwd zolang de Staat van welke zij onderdanen zijn, een normale diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging heeft bij de Staat in wiens macht zij zich bevinden. Echter bestrijken de bepalingen van Titel II, wat haar toepassing betreft, een ruimer terrein, zoals omschreven in artikel 13. Personen, beschermd door het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949, of door het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen van de strijdkrachten ter zee, van 12 Augustus 1949, of door het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949, worden niet beschouwd als beschermde personen in de zin van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  5  

Indien, op het grondgebied van een Partij bij het conflict, deze Partij ernstige redenen heeft om een bepaald door dit Verdrag beschermd persoon te verdenken van handelingen, schadelijk voor de veiligheid van de Staat, of indien vaststaat, dat hij zodanige handelingen pleegt, zal deze persoon geen aanspraak kunnen maken op de rechten en voorrechten krachtens dit Verdrag, welke, indien hij deze zou genieten, nadeel zouden kunnen berokkenen aan de veiligheid van de Staat. Indien, in bezet gebied, een bepaald beschermd persoon in bewaring wordt gesteld als spion of saboteur, dan wel omdat hij onder gegronde verdenking staat van een voor de veiligheid van de bezettende Mogendheid schadelijke handeling, zal die persoon, in de gevallen waarin de militaire veiligheid zulks gebiedend vereist, worden geacht het recht zich met anderen in verbinding te stellen, als bedoeld in dit Verdrag, te hebben verbeurd. In elk dezer gevallen moeten de in de voorgaande leden bedoelde personen niettemin menslievend worden behandeld en, bij vervolging, mag hun het recht op een rechtvaardige en regelmatige berechting, als voorgeschreven in dit Verdrag, niet worden onthouden. Zij moeten voorts de volledige rechten en voorrechten van een beschermd persoon, in de zin van dit Verdrag, herkrijgen zodra zulks verenigbaar is met de veiligheid van de Staat of van de bezettende Mogendheid, al naar het geval ligt.  

### Artikel  6  

Dit Verdrag vindt toepassing van het begin af van ieder conflict of iedere bezetting, als bedoeld in artikel 2. Op het grondgebied van de Partijen bij het conflict houdt de toepassing van dit Verdrag op bij de algemene beëindiging van de militaire operaties. In bezet gebied houdt de toepassing van dit Verdrag op één jaar na de algemene beëindiging van de militaire operaties; niettemin is de bezettende Mogendheid voor de duur van de bezetting - voor zover die Mogendheid de regeringsbevoegdheden in het betrokken gebied uitoefent - gebonden door de bepalingen van de volgende artikelen van dit Verdrag: 1 tot 12, 27, 29 tot 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 tot 77, en 143. Beschermde personen wier invrijheidstelling, repatriëring of nieuwe vestiging plaats vinden na die termijnen, blijven in afwachting daarvan de voordelen van dit Verdrag genieten.  

### Artikel  7  

Onverminderd de overeenkomsten, uitdrukkelijk voorzien in de artikelen 11, 14, 15, 17, 36, 108, 109, 132, 133 en 149, kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen andere bijzondere overeenkomsten sluiten betreffende alle aangelegenheden waarvoor zij afzonderlijke regelingen menselijk achten. Geen bijzondere overeenkomst mag de positie van beschermde personen, zoals in dit Verdrag geregeld, ongunstig beïnvloeden, noch de rechten welke dit hun toekent, beperken. Beschermde personen zullen de voordelen van zodanige overeenkomsten blijven genieten zolang het Verdrag op hen van toepassing is, tenzij uitdrukkelijk het tegendeel is bepaald in bovenbedoelde of nadien gesloten overeenkomsten, dan wel gunstiger maatregelen door één der Partijen bij het conflict ten aanzien van hen zijn genomen.  

### Artikel  8  

Beschermde personen mogen onder geen enkele omstandigheid geheel of gedeeltelijk afstand doen van de rechten welke dit Verdrag en eventueel de bijzondere overeenkomsten, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, hun waarborgen.  

### Artikel  9  

Dit Verdrag zal worden toegepast met de medewerking en onder het toezicht van de beschermende Mogendheden die belast zijn met het behartigen van de belangen van de Partijen bij het conflict. Te dien einde kunnen de beschermende Mogendheden, naast haar diplomatiek of consulair personeel, gedelegeerden benoemen uit haar eigen onderdanen of uit die van andere onzijdige Mogendheden. De benoeming van deze gedelegeerden moet worden onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de Mogendheid bij welke zij hun taak zullen vervullen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zo veel mogelijk de taak van de vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden vergemakkelijken. De vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden mogen in geen geval de grenzen van de hun krachtens dit Verdrag opgedragen taak overschrijden; zij moeten in het bijzonder rekening houden met de gebiedende eisen van veiligheid van de Staat bij welke zij hun taak vervullen.  

### Artikel  10  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag vormen geen belemmering voor de menslievende werkzaamheden welke, met toestemming van de betrokken Partijen bij het conflict, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie op zich neemt voor de bescherming van burgers en voor aan hen te verlenen hulp.  

### Artikel  11  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen te allen tijde overeenkomen de taak welke krachtens dit Verdrag op de beschermende Mogendheden rust, toe te vertrouwen aan een organisatie die alle waarborgen van onpartijdigheid en doeltreffendheid biedt. Indien beschermde personen, om welke reden ook, niet of niet meer de voordelen genieten van de werkzaamheden van een beschermende Mogendheid of van een organisatie, aangewezen overeenkomstig het eerste lid, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een onzijdige Staat of een organisatie, als bovenbedoeld, verzoeken de taak op zich te nemen, welke krachtens dit Verdrag rust op door de Partijen bij het conflict aangewezen beschermende Mogendheden. Indien op deze wijze niet in de bescherming kan worden voorzien, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, verzoeken de menslievende taak, anders krachtens dit Verdrag door beschermende Mogendheden uitgeoefend, op zich te nemen, dan wel, behoudens de bepalingen van dit artikel, het aanbod van de diensten door een zodanige organisatie aanvaarden. Iedere onzijdige Mogendheid of iedere organisatie die door de belanghebbende Mogendheid wordt aangezocht dan wel zich met het bovenbedoeld oogmerk aanbiedt, moet zich bij haar optreden bewust blijven van haar verantwoordelijkheid ten opzichte van de Partij bij het conflict, tot welke de door dit Verdrag beschermde personen behoren, en moet voldoende waarborgen bieden, dat zij in staat is de betreffende taak op zich te nemen en deze op onpartijdige wijze uit te voeren. Van de voorgaande bepalingen mag niet worden afgeweken bij bijzondere overeenkomst tussen Mogendheden van welke zich één ten gevolge van het verloop der krijgsverrichtingen, zelfs tijdelijk, ten opzichte van de andere Mogendheid of haar bondgenoten in haar vrijheid van onderhandelen beperkt ziet, in het bijzonder ingeval het grondgebied van eerstbedoelde Mogendheid, of een belangrijk gedeelte daarvan, is bezet. Waar in dit Verdrag wordt gesproken van een beschermende Mogendheid, wordt daaronder begrepen een vervangende organisatie in de zin van dit artikel. De bepalingen van dit artikel hebben bovendien betrekking op en worden overeenkomstig toegepast in alle gevallen waarin onderdanen van een onzijdige Staat zich in een bezet gebied of op het grondgebied van een oorlogvoerende Staat bevinden, terwijl de Staat van welke zij onderdanen zijn, bij deze geen normale diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging heeft.  

### Artikel  12  

In alle gevallen waarin zij zulks in het belang van de beschermde personen raadzaam achten, in het bijzonder bij meningsverschil tussen de Partijen bij het conflict over de toepassing of uitlegging van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, zullen de beschermende Mogendheden haar goede diensten verlenen tot oplossing van het geschil. Te dien einde kan ieder der beschermende Mogendheden, op uitnodiging van één Partij of op eigen initiatief, aan de Partijen bij het conflict een bijeenkomst voorstellen van haar vertegenwoordigers, in het bijzonder van de autoriteiten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor beschermde personen, eventueel op passend gekozen onzijdig gebied. De Partijen bij het conflict zijn gehouden gevolg te geven aan de voorstellen welke haar tot dit doel worden gedaan. De beschermende Mogendheden kunnen, zo nodig, de Partijen bij het conflict voorstellen de benoeming van een bepaald persoon, behorend tot een onzijdige Mogendheid of afgevaardigd door het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, die zal worden uitgenodigd aan een zodanige bijeenkomst deel te nemen, goed te keuren.  

### TITEL  II  

####Algemene bescherming der bevolkingen tegen bepaalde gevolgen van de oorlog

### Artikel  13  

De bepalingen van deze Titel zijn van toepassing op het geheel der bevolkingen van de bij een conflict betrokken landen, zonder enig voor haar nadelig onderscheid, in het bijzonder gegrond op ras, nationaliteit, godsdienst of politieke overtuiging, en hebben ten doel het door de oorlog veroorzaakt lijden te verzachten.  

### Artikel  14  

In tijd van vrede kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en, na het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, de Partijen bij het conflict, op haar eigen grondgebied en, zo nodig, in bezet gebied, hospitalisatieen veiligheidsgebieden en -plaatsen instellen, zodanig ingericht, dat zij aan gewonden, zieken, gebrekkigen, ouden van dagen, kinderen beneden vijftien jaar, zwangere vrouwen en moeders van kinderen beneden zeven jaar bescherming bieden tegen het oorlogsgeweld. Bij het uitbreken van een conflict en tijdens de vijandelijkheden kunnen de betrokken Partijen overeenkomsten sluiten tot erkenning van de gebieden en plaatsen welke zij hebben ingesteld. Zij kunnen te dien einde de bepalingen, opgenomen in de ontwerp-overeenkomst welke als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is gehecht, in werking doen treden, eventueel met de wijzigingen welke zij nodig mochten achten. De beschermende Mogendheden en het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis worden uitgenodigd hun goede diensten te verlenen om de instelling en erkenning van deze hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden en -plaatsen te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  15  

Iedere Partij bij het conflict kan, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door tussenkomst van een onzijdige Staat of van een humanitaire organisatie, aan de tegenpartij voorstellen om in streken waar gevechten plaats vinden, geneutraliseerde gebieden in te stellen, welke ten doel hebben aan de volgende personen, zonder enig onderscheid, bescherming te bieden tegen het oorlogsgeweld: 

a. gewonden en zieken, zowel strijders als niet-strijders;  

b. burgers die niet aan de vijandelijkheden deelnemen en die, gedurende hun verblijf in die gebieden, geen arbeid verlichten, welke een militair karakter draagt.   Wanneer de betrokken Partijen overeenstemming hebben bereikt ten aanzien van de aardrijkskundige ligging, het beheer, de voedselvoorziening en de controle van het beoogde geneutraliseerd gebied, zal een schriftelijke overeenkomst worden opgesteld en ondertekend door de vertegenwoordigers van de Partijen bij het conflict. In deze overeenkomst zullen de aanvang en de duur van de neutralisatie van het gebied worden vastgesteld.  

### Artikel  16  

De gewonden en zieken, evenals de gebrekkigen en de zwangere vrouwen, moeten in het bijzonder worden beschermd en ontzien. Voor zover de militaire vereisten zulks toelaten, zal iedere Partij bij het conflict het nemen van maatregelen vergemakkelijken om de doden en gewonden op te zoeken, de schipbreukelingen en andere personen die aan ernstig gevaar blootstaan, te hulp te komen en hen te beschermen tegen plundering en slechte behandeling.  

### Artikel  17  

De Partijen bij het conflict zullen streven naar liet sluiten van plaatselijke overeenkomsten voor de evacuatie van gewonden, zieken, gebrekkigen, ouden van dagen, kinderen en kraamvrouwen uit belegerde of omsingelde gebieden, alsmede voor het doorlaten van geestelijken van alle gezindten, van geneeskundig personeel en van geneeskundig materieel, bestemd voor die gebieden.  

### Artikel  18  

Burgerziekeninrichtingen, ingericht voor de verzorging van de gewonden, zieken, gebrekkigen en kraamvrouwen, mogen onder geen omstandigheid het doelwit van aanvallen zijn, doch moeten te allen tijde worden ontzien en beschermd door de Partijen bij het conflict. Staten die Partij zijn bij een conflict, moeten alle burgerziekeninrichtingen voorzien van een bewijsstuk waaruit blijkt, dat zij burgerziekeninrichtingen zijn en dat de in gebruik zijnde gebouwen niet worden aangewend voor doeleinden welke deze inrichtingen zouden kunnen beroven van de bescherming overeenkomstig artikel 19. Burgerziekeninrichtingen zullen worden aangeduid door middel van het embleem, bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949, doch uitsluitend indien zij daartoe door de Staat zijn gemachtigd. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen, voor zover de militaire vereisten zulks toelaten, de nodige maatregelen nemen om de kentekenen waardoor de burgerziekeninrichtingen worden aangeduid, duidelijk zichtbaar te maken voor de vijandelijke strijdkrachten te land, in de lucht en ter zee, ten einde iedere mogelijkheid van een vijandelijke aanval te voorkomen. Met het oog op de gevaren waaraan ziekeninrichtingen zijn blootgesteld indien zij dicht bij militaire objecten zijn gelegen, verdient het aanbeveling, dat deze inrichtingen zo ver mogelijk van zodanige objecten verwijderd zijn.  

### Artikel  19  

De bescherming waarop burgerziekeninrichtingen recht hebben, zal niet eindigen, tenzij daarvan, buiten haar menslievende taak, gebruik wordt gemaakt voor het plegen van voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen. De bescherming zal echter eerst eindigen na een sommatie waarbij, in alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen, een redelijke termijn is gesteld en waaraan geen gevolg is gegeven. Het feit, dat zieke of gewonde leden van de gewapende macht in deze inrichtingen worden verpleegd, of dat daarin aan deze strijders ontnomen draagbare wapens en munitie welke nog niet aan de bevoegde tak van dienst zijn afgeleverd, aanwezig zijn, zal niet worden beschouwd als een voor de vijand schadelijke handeling.  

### Artikel  20  

Het vaste personeel, uitsluitend belast met het werk in en het beheer van burgerziekeninrichtingen, met inbegrip van het personeel, belast met het opzoeken, verzamelen, vervoeren en behandelen van gewonde en zieke burgers, van gebrekkigen en kraamvrouwen, moet worden ontzien en beschermd. In bezet gebied en in gebieden waar militaire operaties plaats vinden, zal dit personeel zich kenbaar maken door middel van een identiteitskaart welke de hoedanigheid van de houder vermeldt en voorzien is van diens fotografie en van het droogstempel van de bevoegde autoriteit, en bovendien door middel van een gestempelde en tegen vocht bestand zijnde armband, welke het bij het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden om de linkerarm zal dragen. Deze armband zal worden verstrekt door de Staat en voorzien zijn van het embleem, bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949. Ander personeel, belast met het werk in en het beheer van burgerziekeninrichtingen, heeft het recht, bij het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden, te worden ontzien en beschermd en de armband te dragen, zoals bepaald en op de voorwaarden vervat in dit artikel. De identiteitskaart zal de werkzaamheden vermelden, welke hun zijn opgedragen. De directie van iedere ziekeninrichting zal te allen tijde een dagelijks bijgehouden lijst van haar personeel ter beschikking houden van de bevoegde nationale dan wel bezettingsautoriteiten.  

### Artikel  21  

Transporten van gewonde en zieke burgers, van gebrekkigen en kraamvrouwen, uitgevoerd te land door konvooien van voertuigen en door hospitaaltreinen of, op zee, door in het bijzonder daarvoor bestemde schepen, moeten op dezelfde wijze worden ontzien en beschermd als de in artikel 18 bedoelde zlekeninrichtingen en zullen, met toestemming van de Staat, worden voorzien van het kenteken, bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  22  

Vliegtuigen welke uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor het vervoer van gewonde en zieke burgers, van gebrekkigen en kraamvrouwen, dan wel voor het vervoer van geneeskundig personeel en materieel, mogen niet worden aangevallen, maar moeten worden ontzien zolang zij vliegen op hoogten, op tijden en volgens routes, zoals deze uitdrukkelijk bij overeenkomst tussen alle betrokken Partijen bij het conflict zijn vastgesteld. Zij mogen worden voorzien van het kenteken, bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949. Tenzij anders overeengekomen, is het overvliegen van vijandelijk of door de vijand bezet gebied verboden. Bedoelde vliegtuigen moeten aan iedere sommatie om te landen gevolg geven. In geval van een zodanige gedwongen landing mag het vliegtuig met de inzittenden, na een eventueel onderzoek, zijn vlucht vervolgen.  

### Artikel  23  

Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zal de vrije doorvoer toestaan van alle zendingen van geneeskundige voorraden en ziekenhuisbenodigdheden, alsmede van voorwerpen, nodig voor de eredienst, welke uitsluitend bestemd zijn voor burgers van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, zelfs indien deze haar tegenstander is. Zij zal eveneens de vrije doorvoer toestaan van alle zendingen van onontbeerlijke levensmiddelen, kleding en versterkende middelen, bestemd voor kinderen beneden vijftien jaar, zwangere vrouwen en kraamvrouwen. De verplichting van een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij om de vrije doorvoer toe te staan van de in het voorgaand lid bedoelde zendingen is onderworpen aan de voorwaarde, dat deze Partij overtuigd is, dat er geen ernstige redenen bestaan te vrezen: 

a. dat de zendingen zullen worden onttrokken aan haar bestemming,  

b. dat de controle niet doeltreffend zal zijn, of  

c. dat de vijand daarvan kennelijk profijt zal trekken voor zijn militaire inspanning of zijn economie, door deze zendingen in de plaats te stellen van goederen welke hij anders zelf zou hebben moeten verschaffen of produceren, of door materiaal, productiemiddelen of diensten vrij te maken, welke hij anders zelf zou hebben moeten aanwenden voor de productie van die goederen.   De Mogendheid die de doorvoer van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde zendingen toestaat, mag aan haar toestemming de voorwaarde verbinden, dat de uitdeling aan de begunstigden geschiedt onder het toezicht ter plaatse van de beschermende Mogendheden. Deze zendingen moeten zo spoedig mogelijk worden doorgezonden en de Mogendheid die de vrije doorvoer daarvan toestaat, heeft het recht de technische regelingen voor te schrijven, waaronder de doorvoer zal worden toegestaan.  

### Artikel  24  

De Partijen bij het conflict zullen de nodige maatregelen nemen, opdat kinderen beneden vijftien jaar, die ten gevolge van de oorlog wees zijn geworden of van hun familie zijn gescheiden, niet aan hun lot worden overgelaten en opdat, onder alle omstandigheden, hun verzorging, de vervulling van hun godsdienstplichten en hun opvoeding worden vergemakkelijkt. Hun opvoeding zal, voor zover mogelijk, worden toevertrouwd aan personen van gelijke culturele traditie. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen de opneming van deze kinderen in een onzijdig land voor de duur van het conflict bevorderen, zulks met toestemming van de beschermende Mogendheid, indien deze bestaat, en mits er voldoende waarborgen zijn, dat de beginselen, omschreven in het eerste lid, in acht zullen worden genomen. Bovendien zullen zij er naar streven de nodige maatregelen te nemen, opdat alle kinderen beneden twaalf jaar geïdentificeerd kunnen worden, hetzij door het dragen van een identiteitsplaatje, hetzij op andere wijze.  

### Artikel  25  

Alle personen die zich op het grondgebied van een Partij bij het conflict of in een door haar bezet gebied bevinden, zullen in de gelegenheid worden gesteld aan de leden van hun naaste familie, waar dezen zich ook bevinden, berichten van strikt persoonlijke aard te zenden en berichten van hen te ontvangen. Deze correspondentie zal met spoed en zonder ongerechtvaardigde vertraging worden verzonden. Indien, ten gevolge van omstandigheden, de correspondentie tussen familieleden langs de normale weg moeilijk of onmogelijk is geworden, zullen de betrokken Partijen bij het conflict zich wenden tot een onzijdig bemiddelaar, zoals het in artikel 140 bedoeld Centraal Bureau, ten einde in overleg daarmede te bepalen op welke wijze het nakomen van haar verplichtingen onder de gunstigste omstandigheden wordt gewaarborgd, in het bijzonder met medewerking van de nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon) Verenigingen. Indien de Partijen bij het conflict het nodig oordelen de correspondentie tussen familieleden te beperken, mogen zij niet verder gaan dan het gebruik van standaard-formulieren voor te schrijven, welke vijf en twintig woorden naar vrije keuze mogen bevatten, en het aantal van deze te verzenden formulieren tot één per maand te beperken.  

### Artikel  26  

Iedere Partij bij het conflict zal de nasporingen vergemakkelijken, welke worden ingesteld door leden van ten gevolge van de oorlog verspreide gezinnen om het contact met elkander weder op te nemen en zo mogelijk het gezin te herenigen. Zij zal in het bijzonder de werkzaamheden bevorderen van organisaties die zich aan deze taak wijden, mits deze voor haar aanvaardbaar zijn en zich gedragen naar de door haar vastgestelde voorschriften met betrekking tot de veiligheid.  

### TITEL  III  

####Status en behandeling van beschermde personen

### AFDELING  I  

####Gemeenschappelijke bepalingen voor de grondgebieden van de Partijen bij het conflict en voor bezette gebieden

### Artikel  27  

Beschermde personen hebben, onder alle omstandigheden, recht op eerbieding van hun persoon, hun eer, hun familierechten, hun godsdienstige overtuiging en de waarneming van hun godsdienstplichten, en hun zeden en gewoonten. Zij moeten te allen tijde menslievend worden behandeld en worden beschermd, in het bijzonder tegen iedere daad van geweld of vreesaanjaging, tegen beledigingen en de nieuwsgierigheid van het publiek. Vrouwen moeten in het bijzonder worden beschermd tegen iedere aanslag op haar eer, met name tegen verkrachting, gedwongen prostitutie en iedere aanranding van haar eerbaarheid. Onverminderd de bepalingen betreffende de gezondheidstoestand, leeftijd en sekse, moeten alle beschermde personen door de Partij bij het conflict, in wier macht zij zich bevinden, gelijkelijk worden ontzien, zonder enig voor hen nadelig onderscheid, gegrond in het bijzonder op ras, godsdienst of politieke overtuiging. De Partijen bij het conflict mogen echter ten aanzien van beschermde personen die contrôle- of veiligheidsmaatregelen nemen, welke ten gevolge van de oorlog nodig mochten zijn.  

### Artikel  28  

Beschermde personen mogen niet worden gebruikt om door hun aanwezigheid bepaalde punten of streken te vrijwaren voor militaire operaties.  

### Artikel  29  

De Partij bij het conflict, in wier macht zich beschermde personen bevinden, is verantwoordelijk voor de behandeling welke hun door haar beambten wordt aangedaan, onverminderd de persoonlijke aansprakelijkheid welke mocht bestaan.  

### Artikel  30  

Beschermde personen zullen alle faciliteiten genieten om zich te wenden tot de beschermende Mogendheden, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, de nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon) Vereniging van het land waar zij zich bevinden, zomede tot iedere organisatie die hun hulp zou kunnen verlenen. Deze verschillende organisaties zullen daartoe van de zijde der autoriteiten alle faciliteiten ontvangen, binnen de grenzen, gesteld door militaire noodzaak of veiligheidsoverwegingen. Afgezien van de in artikel 143 bedoelde bezoeken van de gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden en van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, zullen de gevangenhoudende of bezettende Mogendheden zoveel mogelijk bezoeken vergemakkelijken aan beschermde personen door de vertegenwoordigers van andere organisaties die tot doel hebben geestelijke bijstand of materiële hulp aan die personen te bieden.  

### Artikel  31  

Geen lichamelijke of morele dwang mag ten aanzien van beschermde personen worden uitgeoefend, in het bijzonder met het doel om inlichtingen van hen of van derden te verkrijgen.  

### Artikel  32  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen komen nadrukkelijk overeen, dat het ieder van haar verboden is enige maatregel te nemen, welke lichamelijk lijden of uitroeiing van beschermde personen die zich in haar macht bevinden, veroorzaken. Dit verbod betreft niet alleen levensberoving, marteling, lijfstraffen, verminking en geneeskundige of wetenschappelijke proefnemingen welke de geneeskundige behandeling van een beschermd persoon niet vereist, maar ook alle andere vormen van ruwheid, door burger- dan wel militaire functionarissen toegepast.  

### Artikel  33  

Geen beschermd persoon mag worden gestraft voor een vergrijp dat hij niet persoonlijk heeft begaan. Collectieve straffen, evenals alle maatregelen van vreesaanjaging of terrorisme, zijn verboden. Plundering is verboden. Represaillemaatregelen ten aanzien van beschermde personen en hun eigendommen zijn verboden.  

### Artikel  34  

Het nemen van gijzelaars is verboden.  

### AFDELING  II  

####Vreemdelingen op het grondgebied van een Partij bij het conflict

### Artikel  35  

Alle beschermde personen die het grondgebied bij het begin of in de loop van een conflict wensen te verlaten, hebben het recht zulks te doen, tenzij hun vertrek in strijd is met de nationale belangen van de Staat. Op de aanvragen van deze personen om het grondgebied te mogen verlaten moet worden beslist volgens een op regelmatige wijze vastgestelde procedure en de beslissing moet zo spoedig mogelijk worden genomen. Degenen aan wie is toegestaan het grondgebied te verlaten, mogen de voor hun reis benodigde gelden en een redelijke hoeveelheid goederen en voorwerpen voor persoonlijk gebruik medenemen. Personen aan wie toestemming tot het verlaten van het grondgebied is geweigerd, hebben er recht op, dat een bevoegd gerecht of een daartoe door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid aangewezen administratief college deze weigering zo spoedig mogelijk opnieuw in beschouwing neemt. Op verzoek zal aan de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid - tenzij redenen van veiligheid zich daartegen verzetten of de betrokken personen bezwaren hebben - mededeling worden gedaan van de redenen tot afwijzing van de door deze personen ingediende verzoeken tot het verlaten van het grondgebied en, zo spoedig mogelijk, van de namen van alle personen aan wie toestemming is geweigerd.  

### Artikel  36  

Bij het vertrek, toegestaan krachtens het bepaalde in het voorgaand artikel, moeten de veiligheid, hygiëne, gezondheidszorg en voeding voldoende gewaarborgd zijn. Alle hieraan verbonden kosten worden, van het punt af waarop het grondgebied van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid wordt verlaten, gedragen door het land van bestemming of, in geval van verblijf in een onzijdig land, door de Mogendheid van welke de betrokken personen onderdanen zijn. De practische uitvoering van deze verplaatsingen kan, zo nodig, bij bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen de betrokken Mogendheden worden vastgesteld. Het bovenstaande doet geen afbreuk aan de bijzondere overeenkomsten welke tussen Partijen bij het conflict gesloten mochten zijn met betrekking tot de uitwisseling en repatriëring van haar onderdanen die in vijandelijke handen zijn gevallen.  

### Artikel  37  

Beschermde personen die zich in voorlopige hechtenis bevinden of een vrijheidsstraf ondergaan, moeten gedurende hun gevangenhouding menslievend worden behandeld. Zodra zij zijn vrijgelaten, kunnen zij, overeenkomstig de voorgaande artikelen, verzoeken het grondgebied te mogen verlaten.  

### Artikel  38  

Met uitzondering van de bijzondere maatregelen welke krachtens dit Verdrag, in het bijzonder op grond van de artikelen 27 en 41, kunnen worden genomen, zal de positie van beschermde personen in beginsel beheerst blijven door de bepalingen betreffende de behandeling van vreemdelingen in vredestijd. In ieder geval zullen hun de volgende rechten worden verleend: 

1. zij mogen de aan hen gerichte persoonlijke of collectieve zendingen ontvangen;  

2. zij zullen, indien hun gezondheid zulks vereist, eenzelfde geneeskundige behandeling en ziekenhuisverpleging ontvangen als de onderdanen van de betrokken Staat;  

3. zij zullen in staat worden gesteld hun godsdienstplichten te vervullen en geestelijke bijstand van de bedienaars van hun eredienst te ontvangen;  

4. indien zij verblijven in een streek welke bijzonder aan oorlogsgevaren is blootgesteld, zullen zij evenzeer als de onderdanen van de betrokken Staat gerechtigd zijn die streek te verlaten.  

5. kinderen beneden vijftien jaar, zwangere vrouwen en moeders van kinderen beneden zeven jaar zullen, wat hun behandeling betreft, dezelfde voorrechten genieten als de onderdanen van de betrokken Staat.    

### Artikel  39  

Beschermde personen die, ten gevolge van de oorlog, hun broodwinning hebben verloren, zullen in staat worden gesteld betaalde arbeid te verkrijgen en zullen te dien einde, behoudens veiligheidsoverwegingen en de bepalingen van artikel 40, dezelfde voordelen genieten als de onderdanen van de Mogendheid op wier grondgebied zij zich bevinden. Indien een Partij bij het conflict een beschermd persoon onderwerpt aan controlemaatregelen welke het hem onmogelijk maken in zijn onderhoud te voorzien, in het bijzonder wanneer deze persoon om veiligheidsredenen wordt belet op redelijke voorwaarden betaalde arbeid te vinden, zal bedoelde Partij voorzien in zijn onderhoud en in dat van hen die van hem afhankelijk zijn. Beschermde personen mogen, in alle gevallen, toelagen ontvangen van hun land van herkomst, van de beschermende Mogendheid of van de in artikel 30 bedoelde verenigingen tot hulpverlening.  

### Artikel  40  

Beschermde personen mogen uitsluitend in dezelfde mate als de onderdanen van de Partij bij het conflict, op wier grondgebied zij zich bevinden, tot arbeid worden verplicht. Indien beschermde personen de nationaliteit van een vijandelijke Staat bezitten, mogen zij uitsluitend worden verplicht tot werkzaamheden welke normaal nodig zijn om de voedselvoorziening, huisvesting, kleding, het vervoer en de gezondheid van mensen te verzekeren en welke niet rechtstreeks verband houden met het voeren van militaire operaties. In de gevallen, genoemd in de twee voorgaande leden, zullen voor de tot arbeid verplichte beschermde personen dezelfde arbeidsvoorwaarden en beschermingsmaatregelen gelden als voor de arbeiders van het land waar zij zich bevinden, in het bijzonder wat betreft loon, arbeidstijden, kleding en uitrusting, vooropleiding en vergoeding terzake van beroepsongevallen en -ziekten. In geval van schending van bovenstaande bepalingen, zijn de beschermde personen bevoegd hun recht van beklag uit te oefenen, overeenkomstig artikel 30.  

### Artikel  41  

Indien de Mogendheid in wier macht zich beschermde personen bevinden, de andere in dit Verdrag genoemde controlemaatregelen niet voldoende acht, zijn de strengste controlemaatregelen welke zij mag toepassen, die van het aanwijzen van een gedwongen verblijfplaats of internering, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de artikelen 42 en 43. Bij het toepassen van de bepalingen van artikel 39, tweede lid, op de gevallen waarin personen hun gewone verblijfplaats moeten verlaten krachtens een beslissing waarbij hun een gedwongen verblijfplaats elders wordt aangewezen, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zich zo nauwkeurig mogelijk houden aan de bepalingen welke betrekking hebben op de behandeling van geïnterneerden (Afdeling IV, Titel III van dit Verdrag).  

### Artikel  42  

De internering van of de aanwijzing van een gedwongen verblijfplaats voor beschermde personen mag alleen dan worden gelast indien de veiligheid van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zulks volstrekt noodzakelijk maakt. Indien een persoon, door tussenkomst van de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid, uit vrije wil verzoekt te worden geïnterneerd en indien zijn toestand zulks noodzakelijk maakt, zal hij door de Partij bij het conflict, in wier macht hij zich bevindt, worden geïnterneerd.  

### Artikel  43  

Ieder beschermd persoon die geïnterneerd is of aan wie een gedwongen verblijfplaats is aangewezen, heeft het recht te verzoeken, dat een bevoegd gerecht of een daartoe door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid aangewezen administratief college de te zijnen aanzien genomen beslissing zo spoedig mogelijk aan een nieuw onderzoek onderwerpt. Indien de internering of de aanwijzing van een gedwongen verblijfplaats wordt gehandhaafd, zal het gerecht of het administratief college op gezette tijden, en ten minste tweemaal per jaar, de zaak onderzoeken ten einde de oorspronkelijke beslissing ten gunste van de betrokken persoon te wijzigen, indien de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven. Tenzij de betrokken beschermde personen zich daartegen verzetten, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, zo spoedig mogelijk, aan de beschermende Mogendheid mededeling doen van de namen van de beschermde personen die geïnterneerd zijn of aan wie een gedwongen verblijfplaats is aangewezen, en van hen die uit internering zijn ontslagen of wier gedwongen verblijf is beëindigd. De beslissingen van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde gerechten of colleges zullen eveneens, onder dezelfde voorwaarden, zo spoedig mogelijk ter kennis van de beschermende Mogendheid worden gebracht.  

### Artikel  44  

Bij het toepassen van de in dit Verdrag bedoelde controlemaatregelen zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid vluchtelingen die in feite geen bescherming van enige regering genieten, niet behandelen als vijandelijke vreemdelingen uitsluitend op grond van het feit, dat zij rechtens tot een vijandelijke Staat behoren.  

### Artikel  45  

Beschermde personen mogen niet worden overgedragen aan een Mogendheid die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag. Deze bepaling vormt geen belemmering voor de repatriëring van beschermde personen of voor hun terugkeer naar het land van hun domicilie na het einde der vijandelijkheden. Beschermde personen mogen door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid slechts aan een Mogendheid die partij is bij dit Verdrag worden overgedragen, en dan alleen nadat de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zich ervan heeft vergewist, dat die andere Mogendheid bereid en in staat is het Verdrag toe te passen. Wanneer beschermde personen onder die omstandigheden worden overgedragen, berust de verantwoordelijkheid voor de toepassing van het Verdrag bij de Mogendheid die zich bereid heeft verklaard hen op te nemen, gedurende de tijd, dat zij aan haar zijn toevertrouwd. Niettemin moet, ingeval deze Mogendheid in gebreke blijft op enig belangrijk punt de bepalingen van het Verdrag uit te voeren, de Mogendheid die de beschermde personen heeft overgedragen, op mededeling daarvan door de beschermende Mogendheid, doeltreffende maatregelen nemen om in de toestand afdoende verbetering te brengen dan wel verzoeken haar de beschermde personen terug te zenden. Aan dit verzoek moet worden voldaan. Een beschermd persoon mag onder geen omstandigheid worden overgedragen aan een land waar hij vervolging kan vrezen op grond van zijn politieke of godsdienstige overtuiging. De bepalingen van dit artikel vormen geen belemmering voor de uitlevering - krachtens vóór het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden gesloten uitleveringsverdragen - van beschermde personen, beschuldigd van misdrijven tegen het gemene strafrecht  

### Artikel  46  

Voor zover zulks niet eerder is geschied, zullen de ten aanzien van beschermde personen genomen beperkende maatregelen zo spoedig mogelijk na het einde der vijandelijkheden worden ingetrokken. De ten aanzien van hun bezittingen genomen beperkende maatregelen zullen, in overeenstemming met de metten van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, zo spoedig mogelijk na het einde der vijandelijkheden, worden ingetrokken.  

### AFDELING  III  

####Bezette gebieden

### Artikel  47  

Beschermde personen die zich in bezet gebied bevinden, mogen, in geen geval en op geen enkele wijze, worden beroofd van de voordelen van dit Verdrag, noch krachtens enige wijziging welke zich, als gevolg van het feit der bezetting, in de instellingen of in de regering van het bezette gebied heeft voorgedaan, noch door een overeenkomst, gesloten tussen de autoriteiten van het bezette gebied en de bezettende Mogendheid, noch op grond van een annexatie door de bezettende Mogendheid van het geheel of een deel van het bezette gebied.  

### Artikel  48  

Beschermde personen die geen onderdanen zijn van de Mogendheid wier grondgebied bezet is, kunnen gebruik maken van het recht het grondgebied te verlaten onder de voorwaarden, bedoeld in artikel 35; de beslissingen dienaangaande zullen worden genomen overeenkomstig de door de bezettende Mogendheid met inachtneming van genoemd artikel vast te stellen procedure.  

### Artikel  49  

Gedwongen overbrenging van groepen of individuele personen, alsmede deportatie van beschermde personen van het bezette gebied naar het grondgebied van de bezettende Mogendheid dan wel naar dat van een andere al of niet bezette Staat, zijn verboden, welke de redenen daarvoor ook mogen zijn. Niettemin mag de bezettende Mogendheid tot gehele of gedeeltelijke evacuatie van een bepaalde bezette streek overgaan, indien de veiligheid van de bevolking of dwingende militaire redenen zulks vereisen. Deze evacuaties mogen geen verplaatsing van beschermde personen buiten het bezette gebied medebrengen, tenzij het om materiële redenen onmogelijk is een zodanige verplaatsing te vermijden. De op deze wijze geëvacueerde personen moeten naar hun haardsteden worden teruggevoerd zodra de vijandelijkheden in die streek zijn geëindigd. De bezettende Mogendheid die tot deze overbrenging of evacuatie overgaat, zal, zoveel in haar vermogen ligt, zorg dragen, dat de beschermde personen behoorlijk worden ondergebracht, dat de overbrenging, wat hygiëne, gezondheid, veiligheid en voeding betreft, onder bevredigende omstandigheden wordt uitgevoerd en dat de leden van eenzelfde familie niet van elkander worden gescheiden. De beschermende Mogendheid zal in kennis worden gesteld met iedere overbrenging en evacuatie, zodra deze hebben plaatsgevonden. De bezettende Mogendheid mag beschermde personen niet dwingen te blijven in een bijzonder aan oorlogsgevaren blootgestelde streek, tenzij de veiligheid van de bevolking of dwingende militaire redenen zulks vereisen. De bezettende Mogendheid mag niet overgaan tot deportatie of overbrenging van een gedeelte van haar eigen burgerbevolking naar het door haar bezette gebied.  

### Artikel  50  

De bezettende Mogendheid zal, met de medewerking van de nationale en plaatselijke autoriteiten, het goed functionneren van instellingen, gewijd aan de zorg voor en de opvoeding van kinderen, vergemakkelijken. De bezettende Mogendheid zal alle nodige maatregelen nemen om de identificatie van kinderen en de registratie van hun betrekking tot hun naaste familie te vergemakkelijken. Zij mag in geen geval hun persoonlijke staat wijzigen, noch hen doen dienst nemen in aan haar ondergeschikte formaties of organisaties. Indien de plaatselijke instellingen daartoe niet bij machte zijn, zal de bezettende Mogendheid regelingen treffen voor het onderhoud en de opvoeding - zo mogelijk door personen van dezelfde nationaliteit, taal en godsdienst - van kinderen die ten gevolge van de oorlog wees zijn geworden of van hun ouders zijn gescheiden en die niet behoorlijk verzorgd kunnen worden door een lid van hun naaste familie of een vriend. Een afzonderlijke afdeling van het krachtens de bepalingen van artikel 136 opgerichte Bureau zal worden belast met het nemen van de nodige maatregelen om kinderen wier identiteit onzeker is, te identificeren. Aanwijzingen omtrent hun ouders of andere naaste verwanten behoren, indien beschikbaar, steeds te worden geregistreerd. De bezettende Mogendheid mag de toepassing niet belemmeren van voorkeursmaatregelen op het gebied van voeding, geneeskundige verzorging en bescherming tegen de gevolgen van de oorlog, welke, vóór de bezetting, mochten zijn ingevoerd ten gunste van kinderen beneden vijftien jaar, zwangere vrouwen en moeders van kinderen beneden zeven jaar.  

### Artikel  51  

De bezettende Mogendheid mag beschermde personen niet dwingen te dienen bij haar gewapende macht of hulpdiensten. Iedere pressie of propaganda, welke op vrijwillige dienstneming is gericht, is verboden. De bezettende Mogendheid mag beschermde personen niet dwingen tot arbeid, tenzij zij ouder zijn dan achttien jaar en dan alleen tot werkzaamheden ten behoeve van het bezettingsleger of van de openbare nutsbedrijven, of van de voedselvoorziening, huisvesting, kleding, het vervoer of de gezondheid van de bevolking van het bezette land. Beschermde personen mogen niet worden gedwongen tot enige arbeid welke hen zou verplichten aan krijgsverrichtingen deel te nemen. De bezettende Mogendheid mag beschermde personen niet dwingen met geweld de veiligheid van de inrichtingen waar zij verplichte arbeid verrichten, te verzekeren. De arbeid mag slechts worden verricht binnen het bezette gebied waar de personen wier diensten zijn gevorderd, zich bevinden. Iedere gevorderde persoon zal, voor zover mogelijk, op de plaats worden gehouden, waar hij gewoon is zijn arbeid te verrichten. De arbeid moet naar billijkheid worden beloond en in overeenstemming zijn met de lichamelijke en verstandelijke vermogens van de arbeiders. De in het bezette land van kracht zijnde wetten betreffende de arbeidsvoorwaarden en de beschermende maatregelen, in het bijzonder met betrekking tot lonen, arbeidstijden, uitrusting, vooropleiding en vergoeding terzake van beroepsongevallen en -ziekten, zullen van toepassing zijn op de beschermde personen aan wie de in dit artikel bedoelde werkzaamheden zijn opgedragen. In geen geval mag vordering van arbeidskrachten leiden tot een mobilisatie van arbeiders in een organisatie van militair of semi-militair karakter.  

### Artikel  52  

Geen contract, overeenkomst of regeling mag inbreuk maken op het recht van iedere vrijwillige of niet-vrijwillige arbeider, waar deze zich ook bevindt, zich te wenden tot de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid om haar bemiddeling in te roepen. Iedere maatregel welke ten doel heeft om werkloosheid te veroorzaken of om arbeidsmogelijkheden van arbeiders in een bezet gebied te beperken, ten einde hen te bewegen voor de bezettende Mogendheid te werken, is verboden.  

### Artikel  53  

Het is de bezettende Mogendheid verboden roerende of onroerende goederen, hetzij individueel hetzij collectief toebehorend aan particulieren, aan de Staat of aan openbare lichamen, aan sociale of coöperatieve organisaties, te vernielen, behoudens in de gevallen waarin militaire operaties een zodanige vernieling volstrekt noodzakelijk maken.  

### Artikel  54  

Het is de bezettende Mogendheid verboden de staat van ambtenaren of van leden van de rechterlijke macht in het bezette gebied te wijzigen of op enigerlei wijze te hunnen aanzien strafmaatregelen toe te passen dan wel dwang- of discriminerende maatregelen te nemen, ingeval zij zich op grond van gewetensbezwaren van de uitoefening van hun functie mochten onthouden. Dit verbod vormt geen belemmering voor de toepassing van het tweede lid van artikel 51. Het laat het recht van de bezettende Mogendheid om dragers van openbare ambten van hun functies te ontheffen onverlet.  

### Artikel  55  

De bezettende Mogendheid is verplicht met alle haar ten dienste staande middelen de voorziening van de bevolking met levensmiddelen en geneeskundige benodigdheden te verzekeren; zij moet in het bijzonder levensmiddelen, geneeskundige voorraden en andere noodzakelijke artikelen invoeren, indien de hulpbronnen van het bezette gebied ontoereikend zijn. De bezettende Mogendheid mag levensmiddelen, artikelen of geneeskundige voorraden, welke zich in bezet gebied bevinden, uitsluitend vorderen ten behoeve van het bezettingsleger en de bezettingsadministratie; zij moet daarbij echter rekening houden met de behoeften van de burgerbevolking. Behoudens bepalingen van andere internationale verdragen, moet de bezettende Mogendheid de nodige regelingen treffen, opdat de juiste waarde wordt vergoed voor alle gevorderde goederen. De beschermende Mogendheden mogen, te allen tijde, onbelemmerd de stand van de voorziening met levensmiddelen en geneeskundige benodigdheden in bezette gebieden nagaan, behoudens tijdelijke beperkingen welke door dwingende militaire noodzaak mochten worden opgelegd.  

### Artikel  56  

De bezettende Mogendheid is verplicht met alle haar ten dienste staande middelen, met medewerking van de nationale en plaatstelijke autoriteiten, de ziekeninrichtingen en de geneeskundige diensten in stand te houden, alsmede de volksgezondheid en de algemene hygiëne in het bezette gebied te verzekeren, in het bijzonder door de invoering en toepassing van prophylactische en preventieve maatregelen welke noodzakelijk zijn om de verbreiding van besmettelijke ziekten en van epidemieën te bestrijden. Aan het geneeskundig personeel van alle categorieën zal worden toegestaan zijn taak te vervullen. Indien nieuwe ziekeninrichtingen worden geopend in bezet gebied en, de bevoegde organen van de bezette Staat aldaar niet meer functioneren, moeten de bezettingsautoriteiten, zo nodig, aan die ziekeninrichtingen de erkenning, als bedoeld in artikel 18, verlenen. Onder soortgelijke omstandigheden moeten de bezettingsautoriteiten eveneens het personeel van de ziekeninrichtingen en de transportvoertuigen krachtens de bepalingen van de artikelen 20 en 21 erkennen. Bij de invoering van maatregelen voor de volksgezondheid en hygiëne, alsmede bij hun toepassing, moet de bezettende Mogendheid rekening houden met de morele en ethische opvattingen van de bevolking van het bezette gebied.  

### Artikel  57  

De bezettende Mogendheid mag burgerziekeninrichtingen slechts tijdelijk en slechts in gevallen van uiterste noodzaak vorderen voor de verpleging van gewonde en zieke militairen en dan onder voorwaarde, dat tijdig doeltreffende maatregelen worden genomen om de verpleging en behandeling van de patiënten te verzekeren en te voldoen aan de behoeften van de burgerbevolking op het gebied van ziekenhuisverpleging. Het materiaal en de voorraden van burgerziekeninrichtingen mogen niet worden gevorderd zolang deze nodig zijn voor de behoeften van de burgerbevolking.  

### Artikel  58  

De bezettende Mogendheid zal aan bedienaars van een eredienst toestaan aan hun geloofsgenoten geestelijke bijstand te verlenen. De bezettende Mogendheid zal eveneens zendingen van boeken en voorwerpen, nodig voor de eredienst, in ontvangst nemen en de uitdeling daarvan in bezet gebied vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  59  

Indien de gehele bevolking van een bezet gebied of een deel daarvan onvoldoende bevoorraad is, zal de bezettende Mogendheid hulpacties ten behoeve van die bevolking toestaan en deze met alle haar ten dienste staande middelen vergemakkelijken. Deze acties, welke mogen worden ondernomen hetzij door Staten, hetzij door een onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie, zoals het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, zullen in het bijzonder bestaan uit zendingen van levensmiddelen, geneeskundige benodigheden en kleding. Alle Verdragsluitende Partijen moeten de vrije doorvoer van deze zendingen toestaan en de bescherming daarvan waarborgen. Een Mogendheid die de vrije doorvoer toestaat van zendingen, bestemd voor door een vijandelijke Partij bij het conflict bezet gebied, heeft echter het recht de zendingen te onderzoeken, de doorvoer te regelen volgens voorgeschreven tijden en routes en van de beschermende Mogendheid de redelijke zekerheid te verkrijgen, dat de zendingen bestemd zijn tot ondersteuning van de noodlijdende bevolking en niet zullen worden gebruikt ten voordele van de bezettende Mogendheid.  

### Artikel  60  

Zendingen tot hulpverlening zullen de bezettende Mogendheid in genen dele ontheffen van de aansprakelijkheid welke op haar rust ingevolge de artikelen 55, 56 en 59. De bezettende Mogendheid mag in geen enkel opzicht de zendingen tot hulpverlening onttrekken aan het doel waarvoor zij zijn bestemd, behoudens in gevallen van dringende noodzaak, in het belang van de bevolking van het bezette gebied en met toestemming van de beschermende Mogendheid.  

### Artikel  61  

De verdeling van de zendingen tot hulpverlening, bedoeld in de voorgaande artikelen, zal worden uitgevoerd met de medewerking en onder het toezicht van de beschermende Mogendheid. Deze taak mag ook, bij overeenkomst tussen de bezettende Mogendheid en de beschermende Mogendheid, worden gedelegeerd aan een onzijdige Staat, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie. Deze zendingen tot hulpverlening zullen in bezet gebied vrijgesteld zijn van alle rechten, belastingen of accijnzen, tenzij deze heffingen in het belang van de economie van het gebied noodzakelijk zijn. De bezettende Mogenheid moet een vlotte verdeling van deze zendingen vergemakkelijken. Alle Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen er naar streven de doorvoer en het vervoer van deze voor bezette gebieden bestemde zendingen tot hulpverlening kosteloos toe te staan.  

### Artikel  62  

Tenzij dwingende veiligheidsoverwegingen zich daartegen verzetten, zal het beschermde personen die zich in bezet gebied bevinden, geoorloofd zijn de aan hen gerichte persoonlijke zendingen tot hulpverlening te ontvangen.  

### Artikel  63  

Behoudens tijdelijke maatregelen, welke bij uitzondering wegens dwingende veiligheidsoverwegingen door de bezettende Mogendheid mochten worden opgelegd: 

a. mogen de erkende nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon) Verenigingen haar werkzaamheden blijven verrichten overeenkomstig de beginselen van het Rode Kruis, zoals deze door de Internationale Rode Kruis Conferenties zijn vastgesteld. Andere verenigingen tot hulpverlening mogen haar liefdadige werkzaamheden onder soortgelijke voorwaarden voortzetten;  

b. mag de bezettende Mogendheid in de personeelsbezetting en structuur van deze verenigingen geen enkele wijziging eisen, welke de bovenbedoelde werkzaamheden nadelig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.   Dezelfde beginselen zijn van toepassing op de werkzaamheden en het personeel van bijzondere organisaties van niet-militaire aard, die reeds bestaan of mochten worden opgericht om de bestaansvoorwaarden van de burgerbevolking te waarborgen door het instandhouden van de belangrijke openbare nutsbedrijven, het verdelen van zendingen tot hulpverlening en het organiseren van reddingswerk.  

### Artikel  64  

De strafwetgeving van het bezette gebied zal van kracht blijven, behoudens voor zover zij mag worden ingetrokken of opgeschort door de bezettende Mogendheid ingeval deze wetgeving een bedreiging vormt voor haar veiligheid dan wel de toepassing van dit Verdrag belemmert. Behoudens laatstgenoemde overweging en de noodzakelijkheid om een doeltreffende rechtsbedeling te verzekeren, zullen de gerechten van het bezette gebied hun werkzaamheden met betrekking tot alle vergrijpen in bedoelde strafwetgeving voorzien, blijven verrichten. De bezettende Mogendheid mag de bevolking van het bezette gebied echter onderwerpen aan bepalingen welke noodzakelijk zijn om de bezettende Mogendheid in staat te stellen haar uit dit Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen na te komen, het geregeld bestuur van het gebied te handhaven, alsmede de veiligheid te verzekeren van de bezettende Mogendheid, van de leden en de eigendommen van het bezettingsleger of de bezettingsadministratie, zomede van de door haar gebruikte instellingen en verbindingslijnen.  

### Artikel  65  

De door de bezettende Mogendheid uitgevaardigde strafbepalingen zullen niet van kracht worden dan nadat zij zijn gepubliceerd en in de eigen taal van de bevolking te harer kennis zijn gebracht. Aan deze strafbepalingen mag geen terugwerkende kracht worden verleend.  

### Artikel  66  

De bezettende Mogendheid mag, in geval van schending van de door haar krachtens het tweede lid van artikel 64 afgekondigde strafbepalingen, de verdachte verwijzen naar haar op regelmatige wijze samengestelde, niet-politieke, militaire gerechten, mits deze gerechten in het bezette land zetelen. Beroepsinstanties zullen bij voorkeur in het bezette land zetelen.  

### Artikel  67  

De gerechten mogen slechts die wettelijke bepalingen toepassen, welke van kracht waren vóór het vergrijp werd gepleegd en welke in overeenstemming zijn met de algemeene rechtsbeginselen, in het bijzonder met het beginsel, dat de straf evenredig moet zijn aan het gepleegde feit. Zij moeten rekening houden met het feit, dat de verdachte geen onderdaan is van de bezettende Mogendheid.  

### Artikel  68  

Wanneer beschermde personen een vergrijp plegen uitsluitend met het oogmerk de bezettende Mogendheid te benadelen, zonder dat dit feit een aanslag op het leven van of lichamelijke geweldpleging tegen leden van het bezettingsleger af de bezettingsadministratie inhoudt, noch een ernstig gemeen gevaar oplevert, noch zware schade toebrengt aan de eigendommen van het bezettingsleger of van de bezettingsadministratie of van de bij deze in gebruik zijnde installaties, kunnen deze personen worden onderworpen aan internering of gewone gevangenisstraf, mits de duur van deze internering of gevangenschap evenredig is aan het gepleegde feit. Bovendien zal voor deze vergrijpen internering of gevangenisstraf de enige maatregel van vrijheidsberoving zijn, welke op beschermde personen mag worden toegepast. De gerechten, bedoeld in artikel 66 van dit Verdrag, mogen naar eigen goeddunken een gevangenisstraf vervangen door een maatregel tot internering van dezelfde duur. De strafbepalingen, door de bezettende Mogendheid afgekondigd overeenkomstig de artikelen 64 en 65, mogen alleen dan de doodstraf ten aanzien van beschermde personen inhouden indien deze schuldig zijn aan spionnage, aan een ernstige daad van sabotage tegen de militaire installaties van de bezettende Mogendheid of aan opzettelijke vergrijpen welke de dood van één of meer personen tot gevolg hebben gehad, mits bij de wetten van het bezette gebied, van kracht zijnde vóór het begin der bezetting, op deze vergrijpen de doodstraf was gesteld. De doodstraf mag niet worden uitgesproken tegen een beschermd persoon, tenzij de aandacht van het gerecht in het bijzonder is gevestigd op het feit, dat de verdachte, geen onderdaan zijnde van de bezettende Mogendheid, niet door enige plicht van trouw jegens haar is gebonden. In geen geval mag de doodstraf worden uitgesproken tegen een beschermd persoon die de leeftijd van achttien jaar ten tijde van het plegen van het feit niet had bereikt.  

### Artikel  69  

In alle gevallen zal de duur van de voorlopige hechtenis in mindering worden gebracht op iedere vrijheidsstraf welke een beschermd persoon wordt opgelegd.  

### Artikel  70  

Beschermde personen mogen door de bezettende Mogendheid niet in hechtenis worden genomen, worden vervolgd of veroordeeld wegens handelingen begaan of meningen geuit vóór de bezetting of gedurende een tijdelijke onderbreking daarvan, met uitzondering van schendingen van de wetten en gebruiken van de oorlog. Onderdanen van de bezettende Mogendheid, die, vóór het uitbreken van de vijandelijkheden, toevlucht hebben gezocht op het grondgebied, van de bezette Staat, mogen slechts in hechtenis worden genomen, worden vervolgd, veroordeeld of buiten het bezette gebied gedeporteerd wegens vergrijpen, gepleegd na het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, of wegens misdrijven tegen het gemene recht, begaan vóór het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden, welke, volgens de wetten van de bezette Staat, in vredestijd uitlevering gerechtvaardigd zouden hebben.  

### Artikel  71  

De bevoegde gerechten van de bezettende Mogendheid mogen geen vonnis uitspreken, dat niet is voorafgegaan door een regelmatig proces. Verdachten tegen wie door de bezettende Mogendheid een vervolging wordt ingesteld, moeten,onverwijld schriftelijk, in een voor hen begrijpelijke taal, op de hoogte worden gesteld van de bijzonderheden van de tegen hen uitgebrachte telastlegging; hun zaak moet zo spoedig mogelijk worden voorgebracht. De beschermende Mogendheid moet in kennis worden gesteld met iedere door de bezettende Mogendheid tegen een beschermd persoon ingestelde vervolging, indien de telastlegging de doodstraf of een gevangenisstraf van twee jaar of meer ten gevolge kan hebben; de beschermende Mogendheid moet te allen tijde inlichtingen kunnen verkrijgen betreffende de stand van het proces. Bovendien heeft de beschermende Mogendheid het recht, op haar verzoek, te worden ingelicht omtrent alle bijzonderheden betreffende deze processen en iedere andere vervolging, door de bezettende Mogendheid tegen beschermde personen ingesteld. De kennisgeving aan de beschermende Mogendheid, als bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel, moet onmiddellijk worden verzonden en de beschermende Mogendheid in ieder geval drie weken vóór de datum van de eerste terechtzitting bereiken. Indien bij de aanvang van de terechtzitting geen bewijs wordt overgelegd, dat de bepalingen van dit artikel ten volle in acht zijn genomen, zal de terechtzitting geen voortgang vinden. De kennisgeving moet in het bijzonder de volgende punten bevatten: 

a. identiteit van de verdachte;  

b. verblijfplaats of plaats van bewaring;  

c. gespecificeerde telastlegging (met vermelding van de strafbepalingen waarop deze is gegrond);  

d. opgave van het gerecht dat met de berechting van de zaak is belast;  

e. plaats en datum van de eerste terechtzitting.    

### Artikel  72  

Iedere verdachte heeft het recht de voor zijn verdediging benodigde bewijzen aan te voeren en mag in het bijzonder getuigen doen oproepen. Hij heeft het recht te worden bijgestaan door een bevoegd raadsman van zijn eigen keuze, die hem vrijelijk zal mogen bezoeken en de nodige faciliteiten zal genieten om de verdediging voor te bereiden. Indien de verdachte geen raadsman heeft gekozen, zal de beschermende Mogendheid daarin voorzien. Indien tegen de verdachte een ernstige beschuldiging is ingebracht en er geen beschermende Mogendheid optreedt, moet de bezettende Mogendheid, behoudens toestemming van de verdachte, hem een raadsman ter beschikking stellen. Iedere verdachte zal, tenzij hij daarvan vrijwillig afstand doet, zowel tijdens het vooronderzoek als tijdens de terechtzitting door een tolk worden bijgestaan. Hij heeft te allen tijde het recht de tolk te wraken en diens vervanging te verzoeken.  

### Artikel  73  

Iedere veroordeelde heeft het recht van hoger beroep overeenkomstig de door het gerecht toegepaste wetten. Hij zal volledig worden ingelicht omtrent deze rechtsmiddelen, alsmede omtrent de termijnen waarbinnen deze kunnen worden aangewend. De strafrechtelijke procedure, bedoeld in deze Afdeling, zal, op overeenkomstige wijze, van toepassing zijn op het hoger beroep. Indien de door het gerecht toegepaste wetten niet voorzien in de mogelijkheid van hoger beroep, heeft de veroordeelde het recht tegen de conclusie en de veroordeling bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de bezettende Mogendheid op te komen.  

### Artikel  74  

De vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid hebben het recht de behandeling ter terechtzitting van iedere zaak tegen een beschermd persoon bij te wonen, tenzij deze, bij uitzondering, met gesloten deuren plaats heeft in het belang van de veiligheid van de bezettende Mogendheid, die dan de beschermende Mogendheid dienaangaande zal inlichten. Een kennisgeving, houdende opgave van de plaats en datum van de aanvang van de terechtzitting, moet aan de beschermende Mogendheid worden gezonden. Alle vonnissen welke de doodstraf of een gevangenisstraf van twee jaar of meer inhouden, zullen, met vermelding van de motivering, zo spoedig mogelijk aan de beschermende Mogendheid worden medegedeeld; hierbij zal mededeling worden gedaan, dat de in artikel 71 bedoelde kennisgeving is geschied en zal, ingeval het vonnis een vrijheidsstraf inhoudt, de naam worden vermeld van de plaats waar de straf zal worden ondergaan. De overige vonnissen zullen worden ingeschreven in de registers van het gerecht, welke door de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid mogen worden ingezien. In geval van een veroordeling tot de doodstraf of tot een vrijheidsstraf van twee jaar of meer, zullen de termijnen van hoger beroep eerst beginnen te lopen van het tijdstip af, waarop de beschermende Mogendheid mededeling van het vonnis heeft ontvangen.  

### Artikel  75  

In geen geval mag aan terdoodveroordeelden het recht om gratie te verzoeken worden onthouden. Geen doodvonnis mag worden tenuitvoergelegd, alvorens een termijn is verlopen van ten minste zes maanden van het tijdstip af, waarop de beschermende Mogendheid de mededeling van de einduitspraak welke de veroordeling tot de doodstraf bevestigt, dan wel van de afwijzing van het gratieverzoek heeft ontvangen. Deze termijn van zes maanden mag in bepaalde gevallen worden verkort, wanneer ten gevolge van ernstige en critieke omstandigheden de veiligheid van de bezettende Mogendheid of van haar strijdkrachten aan een georganiseerde bedreiging wordt blootgesteld, mits aan de beschermende Mogendheid van de verkorting van die termijn steeds mededeling wordt gedaan en haar steeds de gelegenheid wordt geboden bij de bevoegde bezettingsautoriteiten stappen te ondernemen met betrekking tot deze doodvonnissen.  

### Artikel  76  

Beschermde personen, verdacht van strafbare feiten, zullen de voorlopige hechtenis en, indien zij zijn veroordeeld, hun straf in het bezette land ondergaan. Zij zullen, zo mogelijk, van andere gedetineerden gescheiden worden gehouden; voedings- en hygiënische omstandigheden moeten zodanig zijn, dat zij voldoende zijn voor het behoud van een goede gezondheid en ten minste overeenkomen met die in de strafinrichtingen van het bezette land. Zij zullen de geneeskundige verzorging ontvangen, welke hun gezondheidstoestand vereist. Zij zijn eveneens gerechtigd de geestelijke bijstand te ontvangen, welke zij mochten verlangen, Vrouwen zullen in afzonderlijke verblijven worden ondergebracht en onder rechtstreeks toezicht van vrouwen staan. Rekening moet worden gehouden met de bijzondere voorschriften voor minderjarigen. Gedetineerde beschermde personen hebben het recht bezoek te ontvangen van gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheid en van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 143. Bovendien hebben deze personen het recht ten minste één pakket tot hulpverlening per maand te ontvangen.  

### Artikel  77  

Verdachte of door de gerechten in het bezette gebied veroordeelde beschermde personen zullen bij het einde van de bezetting, met de hen betreffende dossiers, aan de autoriteiten van het bevrijde gebied worden overgedragen.  

### Artikel  78  

Indien de bezettende Mogendheid het om dwingende redenen van veiligheid nodig acht ten aanzien van beschermde personen veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen, mag zij hun ten hoogste een gedwongen verblijfplaats aanwijzen of hen aan internering onderwerpen. Beslissingen ten aanzien van gedwongen verblijf of internering zullen worden genomen volgens een regelmatige procedure, welke door de bezettende Mogendheid overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag moet zijn vastgesteld. Deze procedure moet voorzien in het recht van hoger beroep voor de belanghebbende partijen. Ten aanzien van dit beroep moet binnen de kortst mogelijke termijn worden beslist. Indien de beslissingen worden gehandhaafd, zal een door genoemde Mogendheid ingesteld bevoegd orgaan deze met geregelde tussenpozen, zo mogelijk iedere zes maanden, aan herziening onderwerpen. Beschermde personen aan wie een gedwongen verblijfplaats is aangewezen en die dientengevolge worden gedwongen hun woning te verlaten, zullen zonder enige beperking de voordelen der bepalingen van artikel 39 van dit Verdrag genieten.  

### AFDELING  IV  

####Regelen betreffende de behandeling van geïnterneerden

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  79  

De Partijen bij het conflict mogen beschermde personen uitsluitend interneren overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de artikelen 41, 42, 43, 68 en 78.  

### Artikel  80  

Geïnterneerden behouden hun volle burgerlijke bevoegdheid en mogen de rechten welke daaruit voortvloeien, uitoefenen voor zover zulks verenigbaar is met de staat van geïnterneerde.  

### Artikel  81  

De Partijen bij het conflict zijn gehouden kosteloos te voorzien in het onderhoud van door haar geïnterneerde beschermde personen en hun op dezelfde voorwaarde de geneeskundige verzorging te verschaffen, welke hun gezondheidstoestand noodzakelijk maakt. Voor het terugbetalen van deze kosten mag geen aftrek worden toegepast op de toelagen, lonen of tegoeden van de geïnterneerden. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid moet voorzien in het onderhoud van personen die afhankelijk zijn van geïnterneerden, indien deze personen onvoldoende middelen van bestaan hebben of niet in staat zijn zelf voor hun levensonderhoud te zorgen.  

### Artikel  82  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal de geïnterneerden zoveel mogelijk naar hun nationaliteit, taal en gewoonten indelen. Geïnterneerde onderdanen van eenzelfde land mogen niet worden gescheiden op grond van het enkele feit, dat zij verschillende talen spreken. Gedurende de gehele interneringstijd zullen leden van eenzelfde familie, en in het bijzonder ouders en kinderen, verenigd blijven in hetzelfde interneringsoord, met uitzondering van de gevallen waarin de werkzaamheden, de gezondheidstoestand of de toepassing van de bepalingen van hoofdstuk IX van deze Afdeling een tijdelijke scheiding noodzakelijk maken. Geïnterneerden kunnen verzoeken, dat hun kinderen die, zonder toezicht van de ouders, in vrijheid zijn gebleven, met hen worden geïnterneerd. Geïnterneerde leden van eenzelfde familie zullen, voor zover enigszins mogelijk, in dezelfde lokaliteiten worden gehuisvest en gescheiden van andere geïnterneerden worden ondergebracht. Het leiden van een familieleven moet hun worden mogelijk gemaakt.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Interneringsoorden

### Artikel  83  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid mag interneringsoorden niet instellen in gebieden welke bijzonder aan oorlogsgevaren zijn blootgesteld. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal, door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheid, aan de vijandelijke Mogendheden mededeling doen van alle vereiste gegevens betreffende de aardrijkskundige ligging der interneringsoorden. Telkens wanneer overwegingen van militaire aard zulks veroorloven, zullen interneringskampen kenbaar worden gemaakt door de de letters IC, zodanig aangebracht, dat zij overdag uit de lucht duidelijk zichtbaar zijn; echter kunnen de belanghebbende Mogendheden een ander middel van aanduiding overeenkomen. Geen ander oord dan een interneringskamp mag op deze wijze worden aangeduid.  

### Artikel  84  

Geïnterneerden moeten afgezonderd van krijgsgevangenen en van om enige andere reden van hun vrijheid beroofde personen worden ondergebracht en verzorgd.  

### Artikel  85  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid is verplicht alle nodige en mogelijke maatregelen te nemen om beschermde personen, van de aanvang van hun internering af, onder te brengen in gebouwen of verblijven welke alle waarborgen bieden voor hygiëne en gezondheid, alsmede afdoende bescherming tegen de wisselvalligheden van het klimaat en de gevolgen van de oorlog. In geen geval mogen permanente interneringsoorden gelegen zijn in ongezonde streken of in streken waar het klimaat schadelijk zou zijn voor de geïnterneerden. In alle gevallen waarin beschermde personen tijdelijk in een ongezonde streek, of in een streek waar het klimaat schadelijk is voor hun gezondheid, worden geïnterneerd, moeten zij, zodra de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, worden overgebracht naar een interneringsoord waar deze gevaren niet zijn te vrezen. De lokaliteiten moeten geheel vochtvrij zijn en voldoende verwarmd en verlicht, in het bijzonder tussen het invallen van de duisternis en het doven van de lichten. De slaapvertrekken moeten van voldoende afmetingen zijn en een goede luchtverversing moet mogelijk zijn; iedere geïnterneerde moet over een behoorlijk nachtleger en een voldoend aantal dekens beschikken, gelet op het klimaat, en op leeftijd, sekse en gezondheidstoestand van de geïnterneerden. Geïnterneerden moeten dag en nacht kunnen beschikken over privaten en urinoirs welke in overeenstemming zijn met de regels der hygiëne en in een voortdurende staat van zindelijkheid worden gehouden. Aan de geïnterneerden moeten in voldoende hoeveelheid water en zeep worden verstrekt voor hun dagelijkse lichaamsverzorging en voor het wassen van hun linnengoed; daartoe zullen de nodige installaties en hulpmiddelen te hunner beschikking worden gesteld. Zij moeten bovendien kunnen beschikken over douches of baden. De nodige tijd voor de hygiënische verzorging en de reinigingswerkzaamheden moet hun worden gegund. Voor het geval het nodig mocht zijn, als tijdelijke uitzonderingsmaatregel, geïnterneerde vrouwen die niet tot één familiegroep behoren, onder te brengen in hetzelfde interneringsoord als mannen, is het te harer beschikking stellen van afzonderlijke slaapvertrekken en privaten verplicht.  

### Artikel  86  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal passende lokaliteiten ter beschikking stellen van de geïnterneerden, welke hun gezindte ook moge zijn, voor het houden van hun godsdienstoefeningen.  

### Artikel  87  

Tenzij geïnterneerden over andere soortgelijke faciliteiten kunnen beschikken, zal in ieder intemeringsoord een cantine worden ingericht, opdat de geïnterneerden de mogelijkheid hebben zich levensmiddelen en voorwerpen voor dagelijks gebruik, zeep en tabak hieronder begrepen, welke hun persoonlijk welzijn en gerief kunnen verhogen, aan te schaffen tegen prijzen welke in geen geval die van de handel ter plaatse mogen te boven gaan. De winsten van de cantines zullen worden gestort in een speciaal hulpfonds, hetwelk in ieder interneringsoord zal worden gesticht en geadministreerd ten bate van de geïnterneerden in dat interneringsoord. Het Comité van geïnterneerden, bedoeld in artikel 102, heeft het recht van toezicht op de administratie van de cantine en op het beheer van dit fonds. Bij de opheffing van een interneringsoord zal het batig saldo van het hulpfonds worden overgemaakt naar het hulpfonds van een ander interneringsoord van geïnterneerden van dezelfde nationaliteit, dan wel, indien een zodanig oord niet bestaat, naar een centraal hulpfonds, hetwelk ten voordele van alle geïnterneerden die in de macht van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid verblijven, zal worden beheerd. In geval van algemene invrijheidstelling zullen de saldi door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid worden behouden, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de betrokken Mogendheden.  

### Artikel  88  

In alle interneringsoorden, blootgesteld aan luchtbombardementen of andere oorlogsgevaren, zal een voldoend aantal passende schuilplaatsen worden ingericht om de nodige bescherming te verzekeren. In geval van alarm moeten de geïnterneerden zich zo spoedig mogelijk daarheen kunnen begeven, met uitzondering van hen die mochten deelnemen aan de bescherming van hun verblijven tegen bovengenoemde gevaren. Iedere beschermingsmaatregel welke ten behoeve van de bevolking wordt genomen, zal evenzeer op hen van toepassing zijn. In interneringsoorden moeten voldoende voorzorgsmaatregelen tegen brandgevaar worden genomen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Voeding en kleding

### Artikel  89  

Het dagelijks voedselrantsoen van geïnterneerden moet, wat hoeveelheid, hoedanigheid en afwisseling betreft, voldoende zijn om een normale gezondheidstoestand te verzekeren en het ontstaan van stoornissen door gemis aan bepaalde stoffen te voorkomen. Rekening moet ook worden gehouden met de voeding waaraan de geïnterneerden gewend waren. Geïnterneerden zullen bovendien de middelen ontvangen om zelf het extra voedsel waarover zij mochten beschikken, toe te bereiden. Voldoende drinkwater moet aan de geïnterneerden worden verstrekt. Het gebruik van tabak is geoorloofd. Geïnterneerden die arbeiden, moeten extra voeding ontvangen in evenredigheid met de aard van de arbeid welke zij verrichten. Zwangere en zogende vrouwen en kinderen beneden 15 jaar moeten extra voeding ontvangen, overeenkomstig hun lichamelijke behoeften.  

### Artikel  90  

Alle faciliteiten zullen aan geïnterneerden worden verleend om zich te voorzien van kleding, schoeisel en extra ondergoed, zowel op het ogenblik van hun aanhouding als later, indien zulks nodig is. Indien geïnterneerden niet beschikken over voldoende kleding, gelet op het klimaat, en zij zich deze niet zelf kunnen verschaffen, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid hun deze kosteloos verstrekken. Kledingstukken welke de gevangenhoudende Mogendheden aan geïnterneerden verstrekt, en uitwendige merktekens welke op de kleding van geïnterneerden worden aangebracht, mogen geen onterend karakter hebben, noch hen belachelijk maken. Werkende geïnterneerden moeten voor hun arbeid geschikte kleding ontvangen, waaronder begrepen beschermende kleding, telkens wanneer de aard van de arbeid zulks vereist.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Hygiëne en geneeskundige verzorging

### Artikel  91  

Ieder interneringsoord moet voorzien zijn van een behoorlijk ziekenverblijf, geplaatst onder het gezag van een bevoegd geneesheer, waar de geïnterneerden de verzorging welke zij nodig mochten hebben, zomede een passende dieetvoeding kunnen ontvangen. Isolatievertrekken moeten worden bestemd voor gevallen van besmettelijke of geesteszieken. Kraamvrouwen en geïnterneerden, lijdende aan een ernstige ziekte, of wier toestand een bijzondere behandeling, operatief ingrijpen of verzorging in een ziekeninrichting noodzakelijk maakt, moeten in een inrichting welke geschikt is om hen te behandelen, worden opgenomen en daar een verzorging ontvangen, welke niet mag achterstaan bij die welke aan de bevolking in het algemeen wordt gegeven. Geïnterneerden zullen bij voorkeur door geneeskundig personeel van hun eigen nationaliteit worden behandeld. Geïnterneerden mag niet worden verhinderd zich bij de geneeskundige autoriteiten voor onderzoek aan te melden. De geneeskundige autoriteiten van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zullen aan iedere behandelde geïnterneerde op diens verzoek een officiële verklaring verstrekken, welke de aard van zijn ziekte of verwonding en de duur en aard van zijn behandeling vermeldt. Een duplicaat van deze verklaring zal aan het Centraal Informatiebureau, bedoeld in artikel 140, worden gezonden. De behandeling van een geïnterneerde zal kosteloos geschieden, evenals het verschaffen van de apparatuur, nodig om hem in goede gezondheid te houden, in het bijzonder van tand- of andere prothesen en van brillen.  

### Artikel  92  

Ten minste éénmaal per maand zullen geneeskundige inspecties van de geïnterneerden worden gehouden. Deze inspecties hebben in het bijzonder ten doel de algemene gezondheids- en voedingstoestand en staat van zindelijkheid der geïnterneerden te contrôleren, zomede besmettelijke ziekten, in het bijzonder tuberculose, geslachtsziekten en malaria, op te sporen. De inspecties zullen in het bijzonder een contrôle op het lichaamsgewicht van iedere geïnterneerde en, ten minste éénmaal per jaar, een röntgenologisch onderzoek omvatten.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Godsdienst, studie en lichaamsoefeningen

### Artikel  93  

Geïnterneerden genieten volledige vrijheid om hun godsdienstplichten te vervullen, waaronder begrepen het bijwonen van hun erediensten, mits zij zich gedragen naar de door de gevangenhoudende autoriteiten voorgeschreven maatregelen van orde. Geïnterneerde bedienaars van een eredienst zijn bevoegd hun ambt vrijelijk onder hun geloofsgenoten uit te oefenen. Te dien einde zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zorg dragen, dat zij evenredig worden verdeeld over de verschillende interneringsoorden waarin zich geïnterneerden bevinden, die dezelfde taal spreken en dezelfde godsdienst belijden. Indien het aantal van deze bedienaars niet voldoende is, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid hun de nodige faciliteiten verlenen, waaronder vervoermiddelen, ten einde zich van het ene interneringsoord naar het andere te begeven, en zal hun worden toegestaan de geïnterneerden in ziekeninrichtingen te bezoeken. Bedienaars van een eredienst genieten voor hun ambtelijke aangelegenheden vrijheid van correspondentie met de geestelijke overheden van het land waar zij zijn geïnterneerd, en, voor zover mogelijk, met de internationale godsdienstige organisaties van hun geloofsbelijdenis. Deze correspondentie wordt niet geacht deel uit te maken van het aantal brieven en briefkaarten, bedoeld in artikel 107, maar is wel onderworpen aan de bepalingen van artikel 112. Wanneer geïnterneerden niet beschikken over de bijstand van bedienaars van hun eredienst, of deze in onvoldoend aantal aanwezig zijn, mag de plaatselijke geestelijke overheid van dezelfde geloofsbelijdenis, in overleg met de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, een geestelijke van hetzelfde geloof als dat der geïnterneerden aanwijzen, dan wel, indien zulks uit confessioneel oogpunt mogelijk is, een geestelijke van een aanverwant geloof of een daartoe bekwame leek. Deze zal de voordelen genieten, verbonden aan het ambt dat hij op zich heeft genomen. De aldus aangewezen personen moeten zich gedragen naar alle voorschriften, door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid vastgesteld in het belang van de orde en tucht en de veiligheid.  

### Artikel  94  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal bezigheden van intellectuele, opvoedende, ontspannende en sportieve aard onder de geïnterneerden aanmoedigen, hen daarbij geheel vrijlatend daaraan al of niet deel te nemen. Zij zal alle mogelijke maatregelen nemen om de uitoefening daarvan te verzekeren, in het bijzonder door geschikte lokaliteiten te hunner beschikking te stellen. Alle faciliteiten zullen aan geïnterneerden worden verleend om hun studiën voort te zetten of nieuwe te beginnen. Het onderwijs aan kinderen en jongelieden moet worden verzekerd; zij moeten scholen kunnen bezoeken, hetzij in, hetzij buiten het interneringsoord. Geïnterneerden moeten gelegenheid hebben zich te wijden aan lichaamsoefeningen en aan sport en spel in de open lucht. Daartoe moet in alle interneringsoorden worden voorzien in voldoende open ruimten. Speciale speelplaatsen zullen voor kinderen en jongelieden worden gereserveerd.  

### Artikel  95  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid mag geïnterneerden slechts arbeid doen verrichten indien zij zulks wensen. Het gebruik voor arbeid welke, indien aan een niet-geïnterneerd beschermd persoon opgelegd, in strijd zou zijn met de artikelen 40 of 51 van dit Verdrag, alsmede het gebruik voor arbeid van onterende of vernederende aard, is in ieder geval verboden. Na een arbeidsperiode van zes weken mogen geïnterneerden te allen tijde verklaren het werk te willen beëindigen, met inachtneming van een opzeggingstermijn van acht dagen. Deze bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan het recht van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid om geïnterneerde geneesheren, tandartsen of ander geneeskundig personeel te verplichten hun ambt uit te oefenen ten behoeve van hun mede-geïnterneerden; om geïnterneerden te gebruiken voor administratieve en onderhoudswerkzaamheden ten dienste van het interneringsoord; om deze personen te belasten met werkzaamheden in de keuken of andere huishoudelijke werkzaamheden, of ten slotte om hen te gebruiken voor werkzaamheden, dienend tot het beschermen van geïnterneerden tegen luchtbombardementen of andere oorlogsgevaren. Echter mag geen geïnterneerde worden verplicht werkzaamheden te verrichten, waarvoor hij door een bevoegd geneesheer lichamelijk ongeschikt is verklaard. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid is verplicht de gehele verantwoordelijkheid op zich te nemen voor alle arbeidsvoorwaarden, de geneeskundige verzorging, de betaling van de lonen en de vergoeding terzake van beroepsongevallen en -ziekten. De arbeidsvoorwaarden en de vergoeding terzake van beroepsongevallen en -ziekten moeten overeenkomen met de nationale wetten en voorschriften en met het gebruik; zij mogen in geen geval achterstaan bij die, toegepast voor arbeid van dezelfde aard in dezelfde streek. De lonen zullen op billijke wijze worden vastgesteld bij overeenkomst tussen de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, de geïnterneerden en eventueel de werkgever, indien deze een ander is dan de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, onverminderd de verplichting van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid om kosteloos te voorzien in het onderhoud van de geïnterneerde en in de geneeskundige verzorging welke zijn gezondheidstoestand noodzakelijk maakt. Geïnterneerden die blijvend worden gebruikt voor werkzaamheden, genoemd in het derde lid van dit artikel, zullen van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid een billijk loon ontvangen; de arbeidsvoorwaarden en de vergoeding terzake van beroepsongevallen en -ziekten mogen niet achterstaan bij die, toegepast voor arbeid van dezelfde aard in dezelfde streek.  

### Artikel  96  

Iedere werkgroep moet administratief ingedeeld zijn bij een interneringsoord. De bevoegde autoriteiten van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid en de commandant van dat interneringsoord zullen verantwoordelijk zijn voor de naleving van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in de werkgroep. De commandant zal dagelijks een lijst bijhouden van de onder hem ressorterende werkgroepen en deze ter beschikking stellen van de gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheid, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere menslievende organisatie, die het interneringsoord mochten bezoeken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Persoonlijke eigendommen en geldmiddelen

### Artikel  97  

Geïnterneerden zijn gerechtigd goederen en voorwerpen voor persoonlijk gebruik te behouden. Geldbedragen, cheques, waardepapieren, enz., evenals voorwerpen van waarde, welke zij bij zich hebben, mogen hun slechts overeenkomstig vastgestelde regelen worden ontnomen. Een gespecificeerd ontvangstbewijs moet hun daarvoor worden overhandigd. De geldbedragen moeten op de rekening van iedere geïnterneerde worden tegoedgeschreven, zoals bepaald in artikel 98. Deze bedragen mogen niet worden omgerekend in een andere muntsoort, tenzij de wetten van het land waar de eigenaar geïnterneerd is, zulks vereisen of de geïnterneerde daarin toestemt. Voorwerpen welke bovenal een persoonlijke of gevoelswaarde hebben, mogen hun niet worden ontnomen. Een vrouwelijke geïnterneerde mag uitsluitend door een vrouw worden gefouilleerd. Bij hun invrijheidstelling of repatriëring zullen de geïnterneerden in geld ontvangen het tegoed van hun rekening, bijgehouden overeenkomstig artikel 98, benevens alle voorwerpen, geldbedragen, cheques, waardepapieren enz., welke hun tijdens de internering zijn ontnomen, met uitzondering van de voorwerpen of waardepapieren, door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid op grond van haar van kracht zijnde wetten achtergehouden. Ingeval eigendommen van een geïnterneerde op grond van deze wetten worden achtergehouden, zal de belanghebbende een gespecificeerd ontvangstbewijs ontvangen. Familiepapieren en identiteitsbewijzen, welke geïnterneerden bij zich hebben, mogen hun slechts tegen ontvangstbewijs worden ontnomen. Nimmer mogen geïnterneerden zonder identiteitsbewijs zijn. Indien zij er geen bezitten, zullen zij speciale door de gevangenhoudende autoriteiten opgestelde bewijzen ontvangen, welke voor hen tot het einde der internering als identiteitsbewijs zullen dienen. Geïnterneerden mogen enig geld in gangbare munt of in de vorm van aankoopbonnen bij zich dragen, ten einde inkopen te kunnen doen.  

### Artikel  98  

Aan iedere geïnterneerde zal op geregelde tijden een toelage worden uitbetaald om hem in staat te stellen levensmiddelen en voorwerpen als tabak, toiletartikelen, enz. te kopen. Deze toelagen kunnen worden verstrekt in de vorm van credieten of aankoopbonnen. Geïnterneerden mogen bovendien toelagen ontvangen van de Mogendheid van welke zij onderdanen zijn, van de beschermende Mogendheden, van iedere organisatie tot hulpverlening of van hun familie, alsmede de opbrengst van hun eigendommen overeenkomstig de wetten van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid. Het bedrag der toelagen, toegekend door de Mogendheid van welke zij onderdanen zijn, zal gelijk zijn voor iedere categorie van geïnterneerden (gebrekkigen, zieken, zwangere vrouwen, enz.) en mag niet door deze Mogendheid worden vastgesteld noch door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid worden verdeeld op grondslag van onderscheid tussen geïnterneerden, als in artikel 27 van dit Verdrag verboden. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal voor iedere geïnterneerde een rekening aanhouden, waarop tegoedgeschreven zullen worden de in dit artikel genoemde toelagen, het door de geïnterneerde verdiend loon en de door hem ontvangen geldzendingen benevens de geldbedragen welke hem zijn ontnomen en ingevolge de op het grondgebied waar de geïnterneerde zich bevindt, van kracht zijnde wetten, beschikbaar mochten zijn. Voor zover verenigbaar met de in het betrokken land van kracht zijnde wetten, zullen aan een geinterneerde alle faciliteiten worden verleend om geldzendingen over te maken aan zijn familie en aan de personen die van hem afhankelijk zijn. Hij mag van deze rekening de bedragen opnemen, nodig voor zijn persoonlijke uitgaven, binnen de door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid vastgestelde grenzen. Hij zal te allen tijde, voor zover redelijkerwijs mogelijk, de gelegenheid hebben navraag te doen naar de stand van zijn rekening of zich daarvan uittreksels te verschaffen. De stand van de rekening zal, op verzoek, aan de beschermende Mogendheid worden medegedeeld, terwijl de rekening de geïnterneerde zal volgen in geval van overplaatsing.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Administratie en tucht

### Artikel  99  

Ieder interneringsoord zal worden geplaatst onder het gezag van een officier of verantwoordelijk ambtenaar, daartoe gekozen uit de geregelde krijgsmacht of de bestaande civiele administratie van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid. De officier of ambtenaar, belast met het gezag over het interneringsoord, moet in het bezit zijn van de tekst van dit Verdrag in de officiële taal of één der officiële talen van zijn land en zal verantwoordelijk zijn voor de toepassing daarvan. Het personeel, belast met het toezicht op geïnterneerden, moet onderricht zijn in de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en van de reglementen, vastgesteld om de toepassing daarvan te verzekeren. De tekst van dit Verdrag en de teksten van bijzondere overeenkomsten, ingevolge dit Verdrag gesloten, zullen, in een voor de geïnterneerden begrijpelijke taal, in het interneringsoord worden aangeslagen of zich in het bezit van het Comité van geïnterneerden bevinden. Voorschriften, orders, waarschuwingen en bekendmakingen van iedere aard zullen aan de geïnterneerden worden medegedeeld en in een voor hen begrijpelijke taal in het interneringsoord worden aangeslagen. Alle orders en bevelen, tot geïnterneerden persoonlijk gericht, moeten eveneens in een voor hem begrijpelijke taal worden gegeven.  

### Artikel  100  

De tucht in interneringsoorden moet verenigbaar zijn met de beginselen van menselijkheid en mag in geen geval voorschriften inhouden, welke aan geïnterneerden lichamelijke inspanning, gevaarlijk voor hun gezondheid, dan wel lichamelijke of geestelijke martelingen zouden opleggen. Tatouëring of het aanbrengen van herkenningstekens op het lichaam is verboden. In het bijzonder zijn verboden langdurig staan of langdurige appèls, lichamelijke oefeningen als strafmaatregel, militaire exercities en beperkingen van het voedselrantsoen.  

### Artikel  101  

Geïnterneerden hebben het recht bij de autoriteiten in wier macht zij zich bevinden, verzoeken in te dienen met betrekking tot het interneringsregiem waaraan zij zijn onderworpen. Evenzo hebben zij onbeperkt het recht, hetzij door tussenkomst van het Comité van geïnterneerden, hetzij rechtstreeks indien zij zulks noodzakelijk achten, zich te wenden tot de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid, om hun aandacht te vestigen op de punten waarover zij zich mochten hebben te beklagen met betrekking tot het regiem der internering. Deze verzoeken en klachten moeten met spoed en zonder wijziging worden doorgezonden. Zelfs indien deze als ongegrond worden aangemerkt, mogen zij geen aanleiding geven tot enigerlei bestraffing. De Comité's van geïnterneerden kunnen aan de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid periodieke rapporten over de toestand in de intemeringsoorden en de behoeften van de geïnterneerden zenden.  

### Artikel  102  

In ieder interneringsoord zullen de geïnterneerden iedere zes maanden, bij vrije en geheime stemming, de leden van een Comité kiezen, dat tot taak zal hebben hen te vertegenwoordigen bij de autoriteiten van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, bij de beschermende Mogendheden, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis en bij iedere andere organisatie tot hulpverlening aan de geïnterneerden. De leden van dit Comité zijn herkiesbaar. De aldus gekozen geïnterneerden zullen in functie treden nadat hun verkiezing door de gevangenhoudende autoriteiten is goedgekeurd. De redenen voor een eventuele weigering of ontzetting moeten aan de belanghebbende beschermende Mogendheden worden medegedeeld.  

### Artikel  103  

De Comité's van geïnterneerden moeten het lichamelijk, moreel en geestelijk welzijn der geïnterneerden bevorderen. In het bijzonder ingeval de geïnterneerden mochten besluiten in hun midden een systeem van onderlinge bijstand te organiseren, zal deze organisatie tot de bevoegdheid van de Comité's behoren, naast de bijzondere werkzaamheden waarmede zij ingevolge andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag zijn belast.  

### Artikel  104  

Leden van Comité's van geïnterneerden mogen niet tot enige andere arbeid worden verplicht, indien de uitoefening van hun functie daardoor zou worden bemoeilijkt. Leden der Comité's kunnen onder de geïnterneerden de hulpkrachten aanwijzen, die zij nodig mochten hebben. Alle nodige faciliteiten zullen hun worden verleend, in het bijzonder een zekere mate van bewegingsvrijheid, vereist voor de vervulling van hun taak (bezoeken aan werkgroepen, het in ontvangst nemen van goederen, enz.). Evenzo zullen alle faciliteiten worden verleend aan de leden der Comité's voor hun correspondentie per post en telegraaf met de gevangenhoudende autoriteiten, de beschermende Mogendheden, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis en hun gedelegeerden, alsmede met de organisaties tot hulpverlening aan geïnterneerden. Leden der Comité's, die zich in een werkgroep bevinden, zullen dezelfde faciliteiten genieten voor hun correspondentie met het Comité van het interneringsoord waartoe de werkgroep behoort. Deze correspondentie mag niet worden beperkt, noch worden beschouwd als een deel van het in artikel 107 genoemd aantal brieven en briefkaarten. Geen lid van een Comité mag worden overgeplaatst zonder dat hem een redelijke tijd is gelaten zijn opvolger op de hoogte te stellen van de lopende zaken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####Betrekkingen met de buitenwereld

### Artikel  105  

Zodra zij beschermde personen interneren, zullen de gevangenhoudende Mogendheden aan hen en aan de Mogendheid van welke zij onderdanen zijn, en aan hun beschermende Mogendheid de maatregelen ter kennis brengen, welke zij tot uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk hebben genomen. Evenzo zullen zij iedere wijziging in deze maatregelen ter kennis van de betrokken Partijen brengen.  

### Artikel  106  

Zodra hij is geïnterneerd of uiterlijk één week na aankomst in een interneringsoord en evenzo in geval van ziekte, overbrenging naar een ander interneringsoord of naar een ziekeninrichting, zal iedere geïnterneerde in de gelegenheid worden gesteld enerzijds aan zijn familie en anderzijds aan het Centraal Bureau, bedoeld in artikel 140, rechtstreeks een intemeringskaart te zenden, zo mogelijk overeenkomstig het als bijlage aan dit Verdrag gehecht model, welke hen inlicht over zijn internering, adres en gezondheidstoestand. Bedoelde kaarten moeten met de grootst mogelijke spoed worden doorgezonden en mogen op geen enkele wijze worden opgehouden.  

### Artikel  107  

Geïnterneerden zijn gerechtigd brieven en briefkaarten te verzenden en te ontvangen. Indien de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid het noodzakelijk acht het aantal door iedere geïnterneerde te verzenden brieven en briefkaarten te beperken, mag dit aantal niet lager worden gesteld dan twee brieven en vier briefkaarten per maand, zoveel mogelijk overeenkomstig de als bijlagen aan dit Verdrag gehechte modellen. Indien de tot geïnterneerden gerichte correspondentie moet worden beperkt, mag dit slechts worden voorgeschreven door de Mogendheid van welke zij onderdanen zijn, eventueel op verzoek van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid. Deze brieven en briefkaarten moeten binnen een redelijke termijn worden vervoerd; zij mogen niet worden opgehouden of achtergehouden bij wijze van tuchtmaatregel. Geïnterneerden die sedert lang zonder bericht van hun naaste familieleden zijn, of die niet in de gelegenheid zijn langs de gewone weg bericht van hen te ontvangen of aan hen te zenden, evenals degenen die zich zeer ver van de hunnen bevinden, zijn gerechtigd telegrammen te zenden, tegen betaling van de telegraafkosten in de muntsoort waarover zij beschikken. Deze maatregel zal eveneens voor hen van toepassing zijn in als dringend erkende gevallen. In den regel zal de correspondentie van geïnterneerden in hun moedertaal worden gevoerd. De Partijen bij het conflict kunnen correspondentie in andere talen toestaan.  

### Artikel  108  

Geïnterneerden zijn gerechtigd, per post of op iedere andere wijze, persoonlijke of collectieve zendingen te ontvangen, welke in het bijzonder bevatten levensmiddelen, kleding, geneeskundige benodigdheden, alsmede boeken en voorwerpen tot voorziening in hun behoeften op godsdienstig terrein of op het gebied van ontwikkeling of ontspanning. Deze zendingen zullen de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid in genen dele ontheffen van de verplichtingen welke krachtens dit Verdrag op haar rusten. Ingeval het om militaire redenen noodzakelijk is de hoeveelheid van deze zendingen te beperken, moeten de beschermende Mogendheid, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere organisatie tot hulpverlening aan de geïnterneerden, belast met het verzenden van deze zendingen, daarmede behoorlijk in kennis worden gesteld. De wijze van verzending van persoonlijke of collectieve zendingen zal, zo nodig, worden geregeld bij bijzondere overeenkomst tussen de belanghebbende Mogendheden, welke in geen geval vertraging in de ontvangst door de geïnterneerden van zendingen tot hulpverlening mag veroorzaken. Zendingen van levensmiddelen of kleding mogen geen boeken bevatten; zendingen van geneeskundige benodigdheden zullen in het algemeen in collectieve pakketten worden verzonden.  

### Artikel  109  

Bij gebreke van bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen Partijen bij het conflict over de wijze van ontvangst en verdeling van collectieve zendingen tot hulpverlening, zal het reglement betreffende collectieve zendingen, hetwelk als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is gehecht, van toepassing zijn. Bovenbedoelde bijzondere overeenkomsten mogen in geen geval het recht van de Comité's van geïnterneerden beperken om bezit te nemen van voor geïnterneerden bestemde collectieve zendingen tot hulpverlening, over te gaan tot de verdeling daarvan en daarover te beschikken in het belang van de geadresseerden. Deze overeenkomsten mogen evenmin het recht beperken van de vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere organisatie tot hulpverlening aan geïnterneerden, belast met het verzenden van deze collectieve zendingen, om toe te zien op de verdeling daarvan onder de geadresseerden.  

### Artikel  110  

Alle zendingen tot hulpverlening aan geïnterneerden zullen vrijgesteld zijn van invoerrechten, accijnzen en andere rechten. Alle postzendingen, pakketten tot hulpverlening en geldzendingen inbegrepen, uit andere landen gezonden aan geïnterneerden dan wel door hen verzonden per post, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door tussenkomst van de Informatiebureaux, bedoeld in artikel 136, en het Centraal Informatiebureau, bedoeld in artikel 140, zullen vrijgesteld zijn van port, zowel in het land van herkomst en van bestemming, als in de landen van doorvoer. Te dien einde zullen, in het bijzonder, de vrijstellingen, voorzien in het Wereldpostverdrag van 1947 en in de overeenkomsten van de Wereldpostvereniging ten behoeve van burgers van vijandelijke nationaliteit, vastgehouden in kampen of in burgergevangenissen, worden uitgebreid tot de andere geïnterneerde personen die krachtens dit Verdrag worden beschermd. De landen die niet zijn aangesloten bij bovengenoemde regelingen, zijn verplicht port-vrijdom te verlenen onder dezelfde voorwaarden. De vervoerkosten van zendingen tot hulpverlening, bestemd voor geïnterneerden, welke, ten gevolge van haar gewicht of om enige andere reden, hun niet per post kunnen worden toegezonden, zullen ten laste komen van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid in alle gebieden welke zich onder haar gezag bevinden. De overige Mogendheden die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, zullen de vervoerkosten in haar onderscheiden gebieden dragen. De uit het vervoer van deze zendingen voortvloeiende kosten welke niet worden gedekt door de bepalingen van de voorgaande leden, zullen ten laste komen van de afzender. De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen er zoveel mogelijk naar streven de tarieven, berekend voor telegrammen welke door geïnterneerden verzonden of aan hen gericht worden, te verlagen.  

### Artikel  111  

Ingeval militaire operaties de betrokken Mogendheden zouden beletten de op haar rustende verplichting na te komen om het vervoer van de zendingen, bedoeld in de artikelen 106, 107, 108 en 113, te verzorgen, mogen de betrokken beschermende Mogendheden, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere organisatie die daarvoor toestemming van de Partijen bij het conflict heeft ontvangen, trachten het vervoer van deze zendingen te doen plaats vinden met passende middelen (spoorwegwagons, vrachtauto's, vaartuigen of vliegtuigen, enz.). De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen trachten hun tot dat doel deze vervoermiddelen te verschaffen en het verkeer ervan toe te staan, in het bijzonder door het verstrekken van de nodige vrijgeleiden. Deze vervoermiddelen mogen eveneens worden gebruikt om te vervoeren: 

a. de correspondentie, lijsten en rapporten, uitgewisseld tussen het Centraal Informatiebureau, bedoeld in artikel 140, en de nationale Bureaux, bedoeld in artikel 136;  

b. de correspondentie en rapporten betreffende geïnterneerden, welke de beschermende Mogendheden, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere organisatie tot hulpverlening aan de geïnterneerden, uitwisselen hetzij met hun eigen gedelegeerden, hetzij met de Partijen bij het conflict.   Deze bepalingen beperken in genen dele het recht van iedere Partij bij het conflict om, indien zij zulks verkiest, het vervoer op andere wijze te organiseren en vrijgeleiden te verstrekken op overeen te komen voorwaarden. De kosten, veroorzaakt door het gebruik van deze vervoermiddelen, zullen naar evenredigheid worden gedragen door de Partijen bij het conflict, wier onderdanen daarvan profijt trekken.  

### Artikel  112  

De censuur van aan geïnterneerden gerichte of door hen verzonden correspondentie moet zo snel mogelijk geschieden. Het onderzoek van voor geïnterneerden bestemde zendingen mag niet op zodanige wijze geschieden, dat de daarin aanwezige levensmiddelen aan bederf worden blootgesteld en zal worden uitgevoerd in tegenwoordigheid van de geadresseerde of van een door hem gevolmachtigd mede-geïnterneerde. De uitreiking van persoonlijke of collectieve zendingen aan geïnterneerden mag niet worden vertraagd onder voorwendsel van moeilijkheden bij de censuur. Ieder verbod om te corresponderen, door de Partijen bij het conflict om militaire of politieke redenen uitgevaardigd, mag slechts van tijdelijke aard en van zo kort mogelijke duur zijn.  

### Artikel  113  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheden zullen alle redelijke faciliteiten verlenen voor de verzending, door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheid of het Centraal Bureau, bedoeld in artikel 140, of op andere wijze, van testamenten, volmachten of andere documenten, bestemd voor geïnterneerden of door hen verzonden. In alle gevallen zullen de gevangenhoudende Mogendheden voor de geïnterneerden het opstellen en legaliseren van deze documenten in de juiste en wettige vorm vergemakkelijken; te dien einde zullen zij hun in het bijzonder toestaan een rechtsgeleerde te raadplegen.  

### Artikel  114  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal aan geïnterneerden alle faciliteiten verlenen om hen in staat te stellen hun eigendommen te beheren, voor zover zulks verenigbaar is met het geïnterneerd zijn en met de van kracht zijnde wetten. Te dien einde kan deze Mogendheid hun, in dringende gevallen en indien de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven, toestaan het interneringsoord te verlaten.  

### Artikel  115  

In alle gevallen waarin een geïnterneerde partij is in een proces voor welk gerecht ook, moet de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, indien de geïnterneerde zulks verzoekt, het gerecht op de hoogte stellen van zijn internering en binnen de wettelijke grenzen zorg dragen, dat alle noodzakelijke maatregelen worden genomen, opdat hij geen nadeel ondervindt van het feit van zijn internering, wat betreft de voorbereiding en het voeren van zijn proces of de tenuitvoerlegging van iedere uitspraak van het gerecht.  

### Artikel  116  

Aan iedere geïnterneerde zal worden toegestaan, met geregelde tussenpozen en zo dikwijls mogelijk, bezoek te ontvangen, in de eerste plaats van zijn naaste verwanten. In dringende gevallen en voor zover mogelijk, in het bijzonder in geval van overlijden of ernstige ziekte van een familielid, zal aan de geïnterneerde worden toegestaan zijn gezin te bezoeken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IX  

####Strafrechtelijke en tuchtrechtelijke sancties

### Artikel  117  

Onverminderd de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk, blijven de wetten welke van kracht zijn op het grondgebied waar de geïnterneerden zich bevinden, van toepassing op geïnterneerden die gedurende de internering vergrijpen plegen. Indien wetten, reglementen of orders handelingen, begaan door geïnterneerden, strafbaar stellen, terwijl dezelfde feiten niet strafbaar zijn wanneer zij worden begaan door niet-geïnterneerde personen, mogen zodanige handelingen slechts tuchtrechtelijke straffen ten gevolge hebben. Een geïnterneerde mag slechts éénmaal worden gestraft voor hetzelfde feit of op dezelfde telastelegging.  

### Artikel  118  

Bij het bepalen van de straf, moeten de gerechten of autoriteiten, in zo ruim mogelijke mate, rekening houden met het feit, dat de verdachte geen onderdaan is van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid. Zij zijn vrij de straf, gesteld op het vergrijp waarvan de geïnterneerde wordt beschuldigd, te verminderen en zijn derhalve niet gehouden de voorgeschreven minimum-straf op te leggen. Opsluiting in lokaliteiten zonder daglicht en, in het algemeen, iedere vorm van wreedheid zijn verboden. Geïnterneerden die een tuchtrechtelijke of gerechtelijke straf hebben ondergaan, mogen niet verschillend van de andere geïnterneerden worden behandeld. De duur van de voorlopige hechtenis, door een geïnterneerde ondergaan, zal in mindering worden gebracht op iedere tuchtrechtelijke of gerechtelijke vrijheidsstraf welke hem mocht worden opgelegd. De Comité's van geïnterneerden zullen op de hoogte worden gesteld van alle gerechtelijke stappen, ondernomen tegen de geïnterneerden die zij vertegenwoordigen, alsmede van de resultaten.  

### Artikel  119  

De tuchtrechtelijke straffen welke op geïnterneerden mogen worden toegepast, zijn: 

1. een boete van ten hoogste 50 % van het loon, bedoeld in artikel 95, gedurende een tijdvak van niet meer dan dertig dagen;  

2. intrekking van voorrechten welke boven de in dit Verdrag voorgeschreven behandeling zijn verleend;  

3. corvéediensten tot ten hoogste twee uur per dag, in verband met het onderhoud van het interneringsoord;  

4. arrest.   In geen geval mogen tuchtrechtelijke straffen onmenselijk, ruw of gevaarlijk voor de gezondheid van de geïnterneerden zijn. Rekening moet worden gehouden met de leeftijd, sekse en gezondheidstoestand van de geïnterneerde. De duur van één enkele straf mag in geen geval dertig achtereenvolgende dagen overschrijden, zelfs niet indien een geïnterneerde zich op het ogenblik dat zijn zaak wordt behandeld, mocht hebben te verantwoorden voor meer dan één tuchtrechtelijk vergrijp, onverschillig of deze feiten al dan niet met elkander in verband staan.  

### Artikel  120  

Geïnterneerden die wederom worden gegrepen na te zijn ontvlucht of bij een poging tot ontvluchting, mogen slechts tuchtrechtelijk worden gestraft, zelfs in geval van recidive. In afwijking van het derde lid van artikel 118, mogen geïnterneerden die wegens ontvluchting of poging daartoe worden gestraft, worden onderworpen aan een speciale bewaking, mits deze hun gezondheid niet ongunstig beïnvloedt, in een interneringsoord wordt toegepast en geen enkele waarborg welke dit Verdrag hun biedt, teniet doet. Geïnterneerden die behulpzaam zijn geweest bij een ontvluchting of een poging daartoe, mogen uit dien hoofde slechts tuchtrechtelijk worden gestraft.  

### Artikel  121  

Ontvluchting of poging daartoe zal, zelfs in geval van recidive, niet als een verzwarende omstandigheid worden beschouwd indien de geïnterneerde wordt verwezen naar een gerecht wegens tijdens deze ontvluchting of poging daartoe gepleegde vergrijpen. De Partijen bij het conflict zullen zorg dragen, dat de bevoegde autoriteiten lankmoedigheid betrachten bij haar beslissing of een vergrijp, begaan door een geïnterneerde, tuchtrechtelijk of strafrechtelijk moet worden afgedaan, in het bijzonder wat betreft feiten welke verband houden met een ontvluchting of een poging daartoe.  

### Artikel  122  

Feiten welke tuchtrechtelijke vergrijpen inhouden, zullen onmiddellijk worden onderzocht Dit geldt in het bijzonder voor ontvluchting of poging daartoe; een wederom gevangengenomen geïnterneerde; zal zo spoedig mogelijk aan de bevoegde autoriteiten worden overgegeven. In gevallen van tuchtrechtelijke vergrijpen zal het voorlopig arrest voor alle geïnterneerden tot het uiterste minimum worden beperkt en de duur van veertien dagen niet overschrijden; de duur moet in alle gevallen op de vrijheidsstraf welke mocht worden opgelegd, in mindering worden gebracht. De bepalingen van de artikelen 124 en 125 zullen van toepassing zijn op geïnterneerden die in voorlopig arrest zijn gesteld wegens een tuchtrechtelijk vergrijp.  

### Artikel  123  

Onverminderd de bevoegdheid van gerechten en hoge autoriteiten, mag een tuchtrechtelijke straf alleen worden opgelegd door de commandant van het interneringsoord, of door een verantwoordelijk officier of ambtenaar die hem vervangt, of aan wie hij zijn tuchtrechtelijke bevoegdheden heeft gedelegeerd. Voordat een tuchtrechtelijke straf wordt opgelegd, moet aan de verdachte geïnterneerde nauwkeurig worden medegedeeld van welke feiten hij wordt beschuldigd. Hem zal de gelegenheid worden gegeven uitleg te geven van zijn gedrag, zich te verdedigen, getuigen te doen horen en, zo nodig, de hulp van een bevoegd tolk in te roepen. De beslissing zal worden uitgesproken in tegenwoordigheid van de beschuldigde en van een lid van het Comité van geïnterneerden. Tussen het aanzeggen van een tuchtrechtelijke straf en de tenuitvoerlegging daarvan mag niet meer dan één maand verlopen. Wanneer aan een geïnterneerde een nieuwe tuchtrechtelijke straf wordt opgelegd, zal tussen de tenuitvoerlegging van deze twee straffen een termijn van ten minste drie dagen verlopen, indien de duur van één dezer straffen tien dagen of meer bedraagt De commandant van het interneringsoord moet een register van opgelegde tuchtrechtelijke straffen aanhouden, hetwelk ter inzage moet zijn voor vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid.  

### Artikel  124  

In geen geval mogen geïnterneerden naar strafinrichtingen (huizen van bewaring, gevangenissen, tuchthuizen, inrichtingen voor dwangarbeid, enz.) worden overgebracht om daar tuchtrechtelijke straffen te ondergaan. De lokaliteiten waarin tuchtrechtelijke straffen worden ondergaan, moeten aan de eisen van hygiëne beantwoorden en in het bijzonder van voldoend nachtleger zijn voorzien; geïnterneerden die een straf ondergaan, moeten in de gelegenheid worden gesteld zich in een staat van zindelijkheid te houden. Geïnterneerde vrouwen die een tuchtrechtelijke straf ondergaan, zullen in verblijven, afgescheiden van die der mannen, worden ondergebracht en onder rechtstreeks toezicht van vrouwen staan.  

### Artikel  125  

Aan tuchtrechtelijk gestrafte geïnterneerden zal worden toegestaan dagelijks lichaamsbeweging te nemen en in de open lucht te vertoeven gedurende ten minste twee uur. Op hun verzoek zal hun worden toegestaan zich op het dagelijks ziekenrapport te melden; zij zullen de verzorging ontvangen, welke hun gezondheidstoestand noodzakelijk maakt, en, zo nodig, worden opgenomen in het ziekenverblijf van het interneringsoord of in een ziekeninrichting. Hun zal worden toegestaan te lezen en te schrijven, alsook brieven te verrenden en te ontvangen. Pakketten en geldzendingen kunnen hun echter worden onthouden tot na het einde van de straf; deze zullen intussen aan het Comité van geïnterneerden worden toevertrouwd, dat aan het ziekenverblijf de aan bederf onderhevige levensmiddelen welke zien in die pakketten bevinden, zal overhandigen. Een tuchtrechtelijk gestrafte geïnterneerde mag niet van de voordelen van de bepalingen der artikelen 107 en 143 worden beroofd.  

### Artikel  126  

De bepalingen van de artikelen 71 tot en met 76 zijn op overeenkomstige wijze van toepassing bij vervolging, ingesteld tegen geinterneerden die zich op het eigen grondgebied van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid bevinden.  

### HOOFDSTUK  X  

####Overbrengen van geïnterneerden

### Artikel  127  

Het overbrengen van geïnterneerden moet steeds op menslievende wijze geschieden. Het moet in de regel per trein of met andere vervoermiddelen worden uitgevoerd en ten minste onder omstandigheden, gelijk aan die waaronder troepen van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid worden verplaatst. Ingeval, bij uitzondering, het overbrengen te voet moet geschieden, is zulks alleen toegestaan indien de lichamelijke toestand van de geïnterneerden dit veroorlooft, terwijl de overbrenging hen in geen geval aan overmatige vermoeienis mag blootstellen. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid moet gedurende de overbrenging aan de geïnterneerden drinkwater en voedsel in voldoende hoeveelheid, hoedanigheid en afwisseling verschaffen om hen in goede gezondheid te houden, zomede de nodige kleding, behoorlijke onderkomens en de nodige geneeskundige verzorging. Zij zal alle vereiste voorzorgen nemen om hun veiligheid gedurende het overbrengen te waarborgen en, vóór hun vertrek, een volledige lijst opstellen van de geïnterneerden die worden overgebracht Zieke, gewonde of gebrekkige geïnterneerden, alsmede kraamvrouwen, mogen niet worden overgebracht indien hun gezondheid door de reis zou kunnen worden benadeeld, tenzij hun veiligheid zulks dringend vereist. Indien het gevechtsfront een interneringsoord nadert, mogen de geinterneerden die zich daarin bevinden, alleen dan worden overgebracht indien hun overbrenging kan plaats vinden onder omstandigheden welke voldoende kans op veiligheid bieden, of indien zij groter gevaar zouden lopen door ter plaatse te blijven dan door te worden overgebracht. Wanneer de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid besluit geïnterneerden over te brengen, moet zij rekening houden met hun belangen, ten einde in het bijzonder de moeilijkheden van hun repatriëring of terugkeer naar hun haardsteden niet te vergroten.  

### Artikel  128  

In geval van overbrenging zullen de geïnterneerden officieel in kennis worden gesteld met hun vertrek en nieuw postadres; deze mededeling zal hun zo tijdig worden gedaan, dat zij hun bagage kunnen pakken en hun familie waarschuwen. Hun zal worden toegestaan hun persoonlijke bezittingen, hun correspondentie en de door hen ontvangen pakketten mede te nemen; het gewicht van deze bagage mag, indien de omstandigheden van de overbrenging zulks vereisen, worden beperkt, maar in geen geval tot minder dan vijf en twintig kilogram per geïnterneerde. Correspondentie en postpakketten, aan hun vroeger interneringsoord geadresseerd, zullen hun onverwijld worden nagezonden. De commandant van het interneringsoord zal, in overleg met het Comité van geïnterneerden, de nodige maatregelen nemen om te voorzien in het vervoer van de gemeenschappelijke bezittingen der geïnterneerden en van de bagage welke de geïnterneerden niet kunnen medenemen ten gevolge van beperkingen, opgelegd op grond van het tweede lid van dit artikel.  

### HOOFDSTUK  XI  

####Overlijden

### Artikel  129  

Geïnterneerden kunnen hun testament deponeren bij de verantwoordelijke autoriteiten, die voor de bewaring daarvan zullen zorg dragen. In geval van overlijden van geïnterneerden, zullen deze testamenten onverwijld aan de door de geïnterneerden aangewezen personen worden toegezonden. Het overlijden van iedere geïnterneerde afzonderlijk zal door een geneesheer worden vastgesteld; een verklaring zal worden opgemaakt, waarin de doodsoorzaak en de omstandigheden waaronder het overlijden heeft plaats gevonden, worden vermeld. Een wettig ingeschreven officiële overlijdensakte zal worden opgemaakt overeenkomstig de voorschriften, geldend op het grondgebied waar het interneringsoord is gelegen; een voor eensluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift zal onverwijld worden toegezonden aan de beschermende Mogendheid en aan het Centraal Bureau, bedoeld in artikel 140.  

### Artikel  130  

De gevangenhoudende autoriteiten zullen zorg dragen, dat de tijdens internering overleden geïnterneerden op eerbiedige wijze, zo mogelijk overeenkomstig het ceremonieel van de godsdienst welke zij beleden, worden begraven en dat hun graven worden ontzien, behoorlijk onderhouden en zodanig aangeduid, dat zij te allen tijde kunnen worden teruggevonden. Overleden geïnterneerden zullen ieder afzonderlijk worden begraven, tenzij overmacht een gemeenschappelijk graf noodzakelijk maakt. De lijken mogen alleen worden verbrand indien gebiedende hygiënische redenen of de godsdienst van de overledene zulks vereisen, dan wel deze de wens daartoe te kennen heeft gegeven. In geval van verbranding zal dit met opgave van redenen in de overlijdensakte van de geïnterneerde worden vermeld. De as moet met zorg door de gevangenhoudende autoriteiten worden bewaard en zo spoedig mogelijk aan de naaste familie worden overgedragen, indien deze zulks verzoekt. Zodra de omstandigheden zulks veroorloven en uiterlijk bij het einde der vijandelijkheden, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, door tussenkomst van de Inlichtingenbureaux, bedoeld in artikel 136, aan de Mogendheden tot welke de overleden geïnterneerden behoorden, de lijsten van de graven der overleden geïnterneerden doen toekomen. Deze lijsten moeten alle bijzonderheden bevatten, nodig om de overleden geïnterneerden te identificeren en de juiste plaats van hun graven vast te stellen.  

### Artikel  131  

Ieder geval van dood of ernstige verwonding van een geïnterneerde, veroorzaakt of vermoed te zijn veroorzaakt door een schildwacht, een andere geïnterneerde of enig ander persoon, evenals ieder overlijden waarvan de oorzaak onbekend is, zal onmiddellijk worden gevolgd door een officieel onderzoek van de zijde van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid. Een mededeling daaromtrent zal terstond aan de beschermende Mogendheid worden gezonden. De verklaringen van alle getuigen zullen worden verzameld; een rapport, bevattende deze verklaringen, zal worden opgesteld en aan genoemde Mogendheid worden gezonden. Indien door het onderzoek de schuld van één of meer personen wordt vastgesteld, zal de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid alle maatregelen nemen voor de gerechtelijke vervolging van de verantwoordelijke persoon of personen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  XII  

####Invrijheidstelling, repatriëring en onderbrenging op onzijdig gebied

### Artikel  132  

Iedere geïnterneerde zal door de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid in vrijheid worden gesteld zodra de redenen welke tot zijn internering hebben geleid, niet meer bestaan. Bovendien zullen de Partijen bij het conflict er naar streven gedurende de vijandelijkheden overeenkomsten te sluiten voor de invrijheidstelling, repatriëring, terugkeer naar de woonplaats of onderbrenging op onzijdig gebied van bepaalde categorieën van geïnterneerden, in het bijzonder kinderen, zwangere vrouwen en moeders met zuigelingen en jonge kinderen, gewonden en zieken of geïnterneerden die een langdurige gevangenschap hebben ondergaan.  

### Artikel  133  

Internering eindigt zo spoedig mogelijk na het staken der vijandelijkheden. Geïnterneerden op het grondgebied van een Partij bij het conflict, die strafrechtelijk worden vervolgd voor vergrijpen welke niet uitsluitend tuchtrechtelijk kunnen worden afgedaan, mogen worden achtergehouden tot het einde van het proces, eventueel tot het einde van de straf. Hetzelfde zal gelden voor hen die tevoren tot een vrijheidsstraf werden veroordeeld. Bij overeenkomst tussen de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid en de betrokken Mogendheid zullen, na het einde der vijandelijkheden of van de bezetting van het grondgebied, commissies worden ingesteld om verspreide geïnterneerden op te sporen.  

### Artikel  134  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen er naar streven, bij het einde der vijandelijkheden of der bezetting, de terugkeer van alle geïnterneerden naar hun voormalige woonplaats te waarborgen, of hun repatriëring te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  135  

De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid zal de kosten dragen van de terugkeer van de in vrijheid gestelde geïnterneerden naar de plaatsen waar zij op het ogenblik van hun internering woonachtig waren of, indien zij hen heeft aangehouden tijdens hun reis of in open zee, de kosten om hen te veroorloven hun reis te voltooien of naar de plaats van vertrek terug te keren. Indien de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid de toestemming om op haar grondgebied verblijf te houden weigert aan een geïnterneerde die daar tevoren zijn domicilie had, zal zij de kosten van zijn repatriëring dragen. Indien de geïnterneerde er echter de voorkeur aan geeft naar zijn land terug te keren op eigen verantwoordelijkheid dan wel ingevolge de bevelen van de Regering aan wie hij gehoorzaamheid is verschuldigd, is de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid niet gehouden de kosten van de reis buiten haar grondgebied te betalen. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid is niet gehouden de kosten te betalen van de repatriëring van een geïnterneerde die op eigen verzoek is geïnterneerd. Indien geïnterneerden overeenkomstig artikel 45 worden overgedragen, zal de Mogendheid die hen heeft overgedragen, zich met de Mogendheid die hen heeft opgenomen, verstaan omtrent het deel der kosten, dat ieder van haar zal dragen. Bovenstaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan de bijzondere overeenkomsten welke de Partijen bij het conflict mochten hebben gesloten met betrekking tot de uitwisseling en repatriëring van hun onderdanen in vijandelijke handen.  

### AFDELING  V  

####Informatiebureaux en Centraal Informatiebureau

### Artikel  136  

Bij het uitbreken van een conflict en in alle gevallen van bezetting zal ieder der Partijen bij het conflict een officieel Informatiebureau oprichten, belast met het ontvangen en doorgeven van inlichtingen betreffende zich in haar macht bevindende beschermde personen. Binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd zal ieder der Partijen bij het conflict aan haar Informatiebureau inlichtingen verstrekken betreffende de maatregelen, door haar genomen ten opzichte van ieder beschermd persoon die langer dan twee weken in bewaring is gehouden, aan wie een gedwongen verblijfplaats is aangewezen of die is geïnterneerd. Bovendien zal zij haar verschillende betrokken overheidsdiensten opdragen het genoemd Bureau snel in te lichten aangaande alle wijzigingen in de toestand van deze beschermde personen, zoals overplaatsing, invrijheidstelling, repatriëring, ontvluchting, opneming in een ziekeninrichting, geboorte en overlijden.  

### Artikel  137  

Het nationale Informatiebureau zal met spoed en met de snelste middelen de inlichtingen betreffende beschermde personen doen toekomen aan de Mogendheid van welke de bovenbedoelde personen onderdanen zijn, of aan de Mogendheid op wier grondgebied zij hun woonplaats hadden, door tussenkomst zowel van de beschermende Mogendheden als van het Centraal Bureau, bedoeld in artikel 140. De Bureaux zullen bovendien alle tot hen gerichte vragen betreffende beschermde personen beantwoorden. De Informatiebureaux zullen de inlichtingen betreffende een beschermd persoon doorgeven, behalve in de gevallen waarin zulks de belanghebbende persoon of zijn familie nadeel zou kunnen berokkenen. Zelfs in dat geval mogen de inlichtingen niet worden geweigerd aan het Centraal Bureau, dat, na van de omstandigheden op de hoogte te zijn gesteld, de nodige voorzorgen zal nemen, zoals aangeduid in artikel 140. Alle schriftelijke mededelingen van een Bureau zullen worden gewaarmerkt door een handtekening of een stempelafdruk.  

### Artikel  138  

De door het nationale Informatiebureau ontvangen en de door dit Bureau doorgegeven inlichtingen moeten zodanig zijn, dat het mogelijk is de beschermde persoon nauwkeurig te identificeren en zijn familie snel in te lichten. Zij moeten voor iedere persoon ten minste bevatten zijn geslachtsnaam, voornamen, plaats en volledige datum van geboorte, nationaliteit, laatste woonplaats, bijzondere kentekenen, voornaam van zijn vader en geslachtsnaam van zijn moeder, datum en aard van de te zijnen opzichte genomen maatregel, alsmede de plaats waar deze is genomen, het adres waarheen correspondentie aan hem kan worden gericht, benevens de naam en het adres van de in te lichten persoon. Evenzo zullen geregeld, en zo mogelijk wekelijks, inlichtingen over de gezondheidstoestand van ernstig zieke of zwaar gewonde geïnterneerden worden doorgegeven.  

### Artikel  139  

Het nationale Informatiebureau zal bovendien belast zijn met het verzamelen van alle persoonlijke voorwerpen van waarde, door de in artikel 136 bedoelde beschermde personen achtergelaten, in het bijzonder bij hun repatriëring, invrijheidstelling, ontvluchting of overlijden; het Bureau zal deze voorwerpen toezenden aan de belanghebbenden rechtstreeks, of, indien het zulks noodzakelijk acht, door tussenkomst van het Centraal Bureau. Deze voorwerpen zullen worden verzonden in door het Bureau verzegelde pakketten, vergezeld van verklaringen, houdende nauwkeurige opgave van de identiteit der personen aan wie deze voorwerpen toebehoorden, alsmede van de volledige inhoud van het pakket. De ontvangst en verzending van alle zodanige voorwerken van waarde zullen in bijzonderheden worden aangetekend in registers.  

### Artikel  140  

Een Centraal Informatiebureau betreffende beschermde personen, in het bijzonder betreffende geïnterneerden, zal op onzijdig gebied worden opgericht. Het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis zal, indien het zulks noodzakelijk acht, aan de belanghebbende Mogendheden voorstellen doen met betrekking tot de organisatie van een zodanig Bureau, dat hetzelfde kan zijn als dat, bedoeld in artikel 123 van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949. Dit Bureau zal belast zijn met het verzamelen van alle in artikel 136 bedoelde inlichtingen welke het langs officiële of particuliere wegen kan verkrijgen; het zal deze inlichtingen zo snel mogelijk doorgeven aan de landen van welke de belanghebbende personen onderdanen zijn of waar zij woonachtig zijn, behalve in de gevallen waarin zulks de personen op wie de inlichtingen betrekking hebben, of hun familie nadeel zou kunnen berokkenen. Het Bureau zal van de zijde van de Partijen bij het conflict alle redelijke faciliteiten ontvangen om het doorgeven van deze inlichtingen mogelijk te maken. De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, en in het bijzonder zij wier onderdanen genieten van de diensten van het Centraal Bureau, worden uitgenodigd daaraan de geldelijke steun te verlenen, welke het nodig mocht hebben. Deze bepalingen mogen niet worden uitgelegd als zouden zij de menslievende werkzaamheden van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis en van de verenigingen tot hulpverlening, bedoeld in artikel 142, beperken.  

### Artikel  141  

De nationale Informatiebureaux en het Centraal Informatiebureau zullen vrijdom van port genieten voor alle poststukken, alsmede de in artikel 110 bedoelde vrijstellingen, en, voor zover mogelijk, vrijdom van telegraafkosten of ten minste belangrijk verlaagde tarieven.  

### TITEL  IV  

####Tenuitvoerlegging van het Verdrag

### AFDELING  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  142  

Behoudens de maatregelen welke de gevangenhoudende Mogendheden noodzakelijk mochten achten om haar veiligheid te waarborgen of uit hoofde van enige andere redelijke noodzaak, zullen zij aan godsdienstige organisaties, verenigingen tot hulpverlening of enige andere organisatie die de beschermde personen te hulp mocht komen, evenals aan haar gevolmachtigde gedelegeerden, alle nodige faciliteiten verlenen voor het bezoeken van de beschermde personen, voor het verdelen onder hen van zendingen tot hulpverlening of van materiaal van iedere herkomst, bestemd voor opvoedkundige, ontspannings- of godsdienstige doeleinden, of om hen te helpen bij het besteden van hun vrije tijd in de interneringsoorden. Deze verenigingen of organisaties kunnen worden opgericht hetzij op het grondgebied van de gevangenhoudende Mogendheid, hetzij in een ander land, terwijl zij ook een internationaal karakter kunnen hebben. De gevangenhoudende Mogendheid mag het aantal der verenigingen of organisaties wier gedelegeerden toestemming hebben om hun werkzaamheden op haar grondgebied en onder haar toezicht uit te oefenen, beperken, mits echter een zodanige beperking niet belet, dat aan alle beschermde personen doeltreffende en voldoende hulp wordt geboden. De bijzondere positie van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis op dit gebied zal te allen tijde worden erkend en geëerbiedigd.  

### Artikel  143  

De vertegenwoordigers of gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden zijn gerechtigd zich naar alle plaatsen waar zich beschermde personen bevinden, te begeven, in het bijzonder naar plaatsen waar deze geïnterneerd, gevangen of werkzaam zijn. Zij zullen toegang hebben tot alle bij de beschermde personen in gebruik zijnde lokaliteiten en mogen zich zonder getuigen met hen onderhouden, zo nodig door tussenkomst van een tolk. Deze bezoeken mogen slechts om redenen van dwingende militaire noodzaak worden verboden en dan alleen bij uitzondering en als tijdelijke maatregel. De frequentie en de duur mogen niet worden beperkt. De vertegenwoordigers en gedelegeerden van de beschermende Mogendheden zullen alle vrijheid genieten in de keuze van de plaatsen welke zij wensen te bezoeken. De gevangenhoudende of de bezettende Mogendheid, de beschermende Mogendheid en, eventueel, de Mogendheid tot welke de te bezoeken personen behoren, kunnen overeenkomen, dat het aan landgenoten van de geïnterneerden zal worden toegestaan aan deze bezoeken deel te nemen. De gedelegeerden van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis zullen dezelfde voorrechten genieten. De benoeming van deze gedelegeerden zal onderworpen zijn aan de goedkeuring van de Mogendheid onder wier gezag de gebieden waar zij hun werkzaamheden zullen uitoefenen, zijn gesteld.  

### Artikel  144  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich de tekst van dit Verdrag, zowel in tijd van vrede als in tijd van oorlog, zo ruim mogelijk in haar onderscheiden landen te verspreiden en in het bijzonder de bestudering daarvan in de programma's van de militaire en, zo mogelijk, burgerlijke opleiding op te nemen, zodat de beginselen daarvan aan de gehele bevolking bekend worden. De burgerlijke, militaire, politie- of andere autoriteiten die in tijd van oorlog de verantwoordelijkheid voor beschermde personen op zich nemen, moeten in het bezit zijn van de tekst van het Verdrag en speciaal omtrent zijn bepalingen zijn onderricht.  

### Artikel  145  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen elkander door tussenkomst van de Zwitserse Bondsraad en, tijdens de vijandelijkheden, door tussenkomst van de beschermende Mogendheden de officiële vertalingen van dit Verdrag mededelen, benevens de wetten en voorschriften welke zij mochten aannemen om de toepassing daarvan te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  146  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich alle benodigde wettelijke regelingen tot stand te brengen, nodig om doeltreffende strafbepalingen vast te stellen voor personen die één der ernstige inbreuken op dit Verdrag, omschreven in het volgend artikel, hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan hebben gegeven. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij is verplicht personen die ervan verdacht worden één van deze ernstige inbreuken te hebben gepleegd, dan wel bevel tot het plegen daarvan te hebben gegeven, op te sporen en moet hen, ongeacht hun nationaliteit, voor haar eigen gerechten brengen. Zij kan hen ook, indien zij daaraan de voorkeur geeft, en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van haar eigen wetgeving, ter berechting overleveren aan een andere bij de vervolging belang hebbende Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, mits deze Verdragsluitende Partij een met voldoende bewijzen gestaafde telastlegging welke een vervolging rechtvaardigt, tegen de betrokken personen inbrengt. Iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zal maatregelen nemen, nodig om de met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag strijdige handelingen welke niet vallen onder de in het volgend artikel omschreven ernstige inbreuken, tegen te gaan. Onder alle omstandigheden zullen de verdachten de waarborgen genieten voor een behoorlijke berechting en verdediging, welke niet minder gunstig mogen zijn dan die, voorgeschreven in artikel 105 en volgende van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de behandeling van krijgsgevangenen, van 12 Augustus 1949.  

### Artikel  147  

De ernstige inbreuken, bedoeld in het voorgaand artikel, zijn die welke één der volgende handelingen in zich sluiten, indien deze worden gepleegd tegen door het Verdrag beschermde personen of goederen: opzettelijke levensberoving, marteling of onmenselijke behandeling, waaronder begrepen biologische proefnemingen, het moedwillig veroorzaken van hevig lijden, van ernstig lichamelijk letsel, dan wel van ernstige schade aan de gezondheid, onrechtmatige deportatie of overbrenging, onrechtmatige gevangenhouding, een beschermd persoon te dwingen om te dienen bij de strijdkrachten van de vijandelijke Mogendheid, of opzettelijk een beschermd persoon het recht te onthouden op een regelmatige en onpartijdige berechting overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, het nemen van gijzelaars, vernieling en toeëigening van goederen, niet gerechtvaardigd door militaire noodzaak en uitgevoerd op grote schaal en op onrechtmatige en moedwillige wijze.  

### Artikel  148  

Geen der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen mag zich zelf of een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij onttrekken aan enige op haar of op een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij rustende aansprakelijkheid op grond van de in het voorgaand artikel bedoelde inbreuken.  

### Artikel  149  

Op verzoek van een Partij bij het conflict moet, op een door de belanghebbende Partijen overeen te komen wijze, een onderzoek worden ingesteld naar iedere beweerde schending van het Verdrag. Indien geen overeenstemming over de procedure van het onderzoek wordt bereikt, zullen de Partijen zich met elkander verstaan over de keuze van een scheidsrechter, die omtrent de te volgen procedure zal beslissen. Wanneer de schending is vastgesteld, zullen de Partijen bij het conflict daaraan een einde maken en deze zo spoedig mogelijk bestraffen.  

### AFDELING  II  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  150  

Dit Verdrag is opgesteld in de Franse en de Engelse taal. Beide teksten zijn gelijkelijk authentiek. De Zwitserse Bondsraad zal officiële vertalingen van het Verdrag in de Russische en de Spaanse taal doen opstellen.  

### Artikel  151  

Dit Verdrag, hetwelk de datum van deze dag draagt, kan tot 12 Februari 1950 worden ondertekend uit naam van alle Mogendheden die vertegenwoordigd waren op de Conferentie welke te Genève op 21 April 1949 werd geopend.  

### Artikel  152  

Dit Verdrag zal zo spoedig mogelijk worden bekrachtigd en de akten van bekrachtiging zullen worden nedergelegd te Bern. Van de nederlegging van iedere akte van bekrachtiging zal een proces-verbaal worden opgemaakt, waarvan een voor eensluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift door de Zwitserse Bondsraad zal worden toegezonden aan alle Mogendheden uit wier naam het Verdrag is ondertekend of de toetreding is medegedeeld.  

### Artikel  153  

Dit Verdrag zal in werking treden zes maanden nadat ten minste twee akten van bekrachtiging zijn nedergelegd. Daarna zal het Verdrag voor iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij in werking treden zes maanden na het nederleggen van haar akte van bekrachtiging.  

### Artikel  154  

In de betrekkingen tussen de Mogendheden die gebonden zijn door het Haagse Verdrag nopens de wetten en gebruiken van den oorlog te land, hetzij dat van 29 Juli 1899, hetzij dat van 18 October 1907, en die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, zal dit Verdrag de Afdelingen II en III van het als bijlage aan voornoemde Haagse Verdragen gehecht Reglement aanvullen.  

### Artikel  155  

Van de datum van zijn inwerkingtreding af zal dit Verdrag openstaan voor toetreding door iedere Mogendheid, uit wier naam het Verdrag niet is ondertekend.  

### Artikel  156  

Toetredingen zullen schriftelijk worden medegedeeld aan de Zwitserse Bondsraad en worden zes maanden na de datum waarop zij de Bondsraad hebben bereikt, van kracht. De Zwitserse Bondsraad zal de toetredingen mededelen aan alle Mogendheden uit wier naam het Verdrag is ondertekend of de toetreding is medegedeeld.  

### Artikel  157  

De in de artikelen 2 en 3 bedoelde omstandigheden zullen de door de Partijen bij het conflict voor of na het begin van de vijandelijkheden of van de bezetting nedergelegde akten van bekrachtiging en medegedeelde toetredingen onmiddellijk in werking doen treden. De Zwitserse Bondsraad zal langs de snelste weg mededeling doen van de van Partijen bij het conflict ontvangen akten van bekrachtiging of toetredingen.  

### Artikel  158  

Ieder der Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft de bevoegdheid dit Verdrag op te zeggen. Opzegging zal schriftelijk ter kennis worden gebracht van de Zwitserse Bondsraad. Deze zal daarvan mededeling doen aan de Regeringen van alle Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen. De opzegging wordt van kracht één jaar nadat daarvan kennis is gegeven aan de Zwitserse Bondsraad. Echter zal een opzegging waarvan kennis is gegeven terwijl de opzeggende Mogendheid in een conflict is betrokken, in geen enkel opzicht gevolg hebben, zolang de vrede niet is gesloten en in ieder geval niet zolang de werkzaamheden voor de invrijheidstelling en repatriëring van de door dit Verdrag beschermde personen niet zijn beëindigd. De opzegging zal slechts gelden ten aanzien van de opzeggende Mogendheid. Zij zal geen enkele invloed hebben op de verplichtingen welke de Partijen bij het conflict gehouden zijn te blijven vervullen krachtens de beginselen van het volkenrecht, zoals deze voortvloeien uit de tussen beschaafde volken gevestigde gebruiken, de wetten der menselijkheid en de eisen van het openbaar rechtsbewustzijn.  

### Artikel  159  

De Zwitserse Bondsraad zal dit Verdrag doen registreren bij het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties. De Zwitserse Bondsraad zal eveneens aan het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties mededeling doen van alle bekrachtigingen, toetredingen en opzeggingen welke de Bondsraad ontvangt in verband met dit Verdrag.

### BIJLAGE  I  

####Ontwerp-overeenkomst betreffende hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden en -plaatsen

### Artikel  1  

De hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden zullen uitsluitend bestemd zijn voor personen, genoemd in artikel 23 van het Verdrag van Genève voor de verbetering van het lot der gewonden en zieken, zich bevindende bij de strijdkrachten te velde, van 12 Augustus 1949, en in artikel 14 van het Verdrag van Genève betreffende de bescherming van burgers in oorlogstijd, van 12 Augustus 1949, alsmede voor het personeel, belast met de organisatie en het beheer van deze gebieden en plaatsen en met de verzorging van de daarin bijeengebrachte personen. Echter hebben de personen die hun vaste woonplaats in deze gebieden hebben, het recht daar te blijven.  

### Artikel  2  

Personen die zich, in welke hoedanigheid ook, in een hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebied bevinden, mogen noch binnen noch buiten dit gebied enige werkzaamheid verrichten, welke rechtstreeks verband houdt met de krijgsverrichtingen of met de vervaardiging van oorlogsmaterieel.  

### Artikel  3  

De Mogendheid die een hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebied instelt, zal alle nodige maatregelen nemen om de toegang te ontzeggen aan alle personen die niet gerechtigd zijn het te betreden of zich aldaar te bevinden.  

### Artikel  4  

Hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden moeten aan de volgende voorwaarden voldoen: 

a. zij mogen slechts een klein gedeelte omvatten van het grondgebied dat onder het gezag staat van de Mogendheid die deze gebieden heeft ingesteld;  

b. zij moeten, in verhouding tot hun opnemingsmogelijkheden, dun bevolkt zijn;  

c. zij mogen geen enkel militair doel noch enige belangrijke industriële of administratieve instelling bevatten, noch in de nabijheid daarvan zijn gelegen;  

d. zij mogen niet gelegen zijn in streken welke, naar alle waarschijnlijkheid, van belang kunnen worden voor de oorlogvoering.    

### Artikel  5

b. zij mogen onder geen omstandigheid militair worden verdedigd.    

### Artikel  6  

Hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden zullen worden aangeduid door langs de omtrek en op de gebouwen aangebrachte rode kruizen (rode halve manen, rode leeuwen en zonnen) op wit veld. De uitsluitend voor de gewonden en zieken bestemde gebieden kunnen worden aangeduid door rode kruizen (rode halve manen, rode leeuwen en zonnen) op wit veld. Des nachts kunnen zij eveneens door een passende verlichting worden aangeduid.  

### Artikel  7  

Iedere Mogendheid zal in tijd van vrede of bij het uitbreken der vijandelijkheden aan alle Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen een lijst van de hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden, ingesteld op het onder haar gezag staand grondgebied, doen toekomen. Zij zal eveneens kennis geven van ieder nieuw gebied dat gedurende de vijandelijkheden wordt ingesteld. Zodra de tegenpartij de hierboven vermelde kennisgeving heeft ontvangen, is het gebied volgens de regels ingesteld. Indien evenwel de tegenpartij van oordeel is, dat aan één van de voorwaarden van deze overeenkomst niet is voldaan, kan zij weigeren dit gebied te erkennen door zulks onmiddellijk te berichten aan de Partij die verantwoordelijk is voor het bedoelde gebied, dan wel haar erkenning afhankelijk maken van de instelling van het toezicht, bedoeld in artikel 8.  

### Artikel  8  

Iedere Mogendheid die één of meer door de tegenpartij ingestelde hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden heeft erkend, heeft het recht te eisen, dat één of meer bijzondere commissies toezien of de gebieden aan de in deze overeenkomst voorgeschreven voorwaarden en verplichtingen voldoen. Te dien einde hebben de leden van de bijzondere commissies te allen tijde vrije toegang tot de verschillende gebieden en kunnen daar zelfs permanent verblijf houden. Ten behoeve van de uitoefening van hun toezicht zullen hun alle faciliteiten worden verleend.  

### Artikel  9  

Ingeval de bijzondere commissies feiten zouden vaststellen welke hun in strijd met de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst voorkomen, zullen zij onmiddellijk de aandacht van de Mogendheid die het betreffende gebied beheert, daarop vestigen en haar een termijn van ten hoogste vijf dagen toestaan om in de aangelegenheid te voorzien; zij zullen de Mogendheid die het gebied heeft erkend, daarmede in kennis stellen. Indien, na verloop van deze termijn, de Mogendheid die het gebied onder haar gezag heeft, geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan de tot haar gerichte waarschuwing, kan de tegenpartij verklaren, dat zij, wat betreft dit gebied, niet langer door deze overeenkomst is gebonden.  

### Artikel  10  

De Mogendheid die één of meer hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden heeft ingesteld, en de tegenpartijen die met het bestaan daarvan in kennis zijn gesteld, zullen de personen benoemen, die deel zullen uitmaken van de in de artikelen 8 en 9 bedoelde bijzondere commissies, of hen door onzijdige Mogendheden doen benoemen.  

### Artikel  11  

Hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden mogen onder geen omstandigheid worden aangevallen, maar moeten te allen tijde door de Partijen bij het conflict worden beschermd en ontzien.  

### Artikel  12  

In geval van bezetting van een grondgebied, moet men de zich daarin bevindende hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden blijven ontzien; deze moeten als zodanig in gebruik blijven. De bezettende Mogendheid mag evenwel de bestemming daarvan wijzigen, mits alle maatregelen zijn genomen om de veiligheid van de daarin bijeengebrachte personen te verzekeren.  

### Artikel  13  

Deze overeenkomst is eveneens van toepassing op plaatsen welke de Mogendheden voor dezelfde doeleinden als hospitalisatie- en veiligheidsgebieden zouden gebruiken.

####REGLEMENT BETREFFENDE COLLECTIEVE ZENDINGEN AAN GEÏNTERNEERDE BURGERS

### Artikel  1  

De Comité's van geïnterneerden zijn gerechtigd de collectieve zendingen tot hulpverlening, waarvoor zij verantwoordelijk zijn, te verdelen onder alle geïnterneerden die administratief bij hun interneringsoord zijn ingedeeld, met inbegrip van hen die zich in ziekeninrichtingen, of in gevangenissen of andere strafinrichtingen bevinden.  

### Artikel  2  

De verdeling van collectieve zendingen tot hulpverlening zal geschieden overeenkomstig de instructies van de schenkers en het door de Comité's van geïnterneerden opgesteld schema; de verdeling van zendingen van geneeskundige voorraden zal echter bij voorkeur plaats vinden in overleg met de met de leiding belaste geneesheren; deze mogen in ziekeninrichtingen en -verblijven van voornoemde instructies afwijken voor zover de behoeften van hun patiënten zulks vereisen. Binnen de aldus bepaalde grenzen moet deze verdeling altijd billijk worden uitgevoerd.  

### Artikel  3  

Ten einde de hoedanigheid en hoeveelheid van de ontvangen goederen te kunnen onderzoeken en dienaangaande in bijzonderheden te kunnen rapporteren aan de schenkers, zijn de leden der Comité's van geïnterneerden gerechtigd zich te begeven naar de spoorwegstations en andere in de nabijheid van hun interneringsoord gelegen aankomstplaatsen van zendingen tot hulpverlening.  

### Artikel  4  

De Comité's van geïnterneerden zullen de nodige faciliteiten ontvangen om te onderzoeken of de verdeling van collectieve zendingen in alle onderafdelingen en dependances van hun interneringsoord overeenkomstig hun instructies is uitgevoerd.  

### Artikel  5  

De Comité's van geïnterneerden zijn gerechtigd formulieren of vragenlijsten, bestemd voor de schenkers en betrekking hebbend op collectieve zendingen (verdeling, behoeften, hoeveelheden, enz.), in te vullen, alsmede te doen invullen door de leden der Comité's van geïnterneerden in werkgroepen of door de niet de leiding van ziekenverblijven en -inrichtingen belaste geneesheren. Deze formulieren en vragenlijsten zullen na invulling onverwijld aan de schenkers worden gezonden.  

### Artikel  6  

Ten einde een geregelde uitdeling van collectieve zendingen aan de geïnterneerden van hun interneringsoord te verzekeren en eventueel te voorzien in de behoeften welke door de aankomst van nieuwe groepen geïnterneerden mochten ontstaan, zijn de Comité's van geïnterneerden gerechtigd passende voorraden van collectieve zendingen aan te leggen en in stand te houden. Te dien einde zullen zij de beschikking hebben over geschikte opslagplaatsen; iedere opslagplaats zal voorzien zijn van twee sloten; het Comité van geïnterneerden zal in het bezit zijn van de sleutels van het ene slot en de commandant van het interneringsoord van die van het andere.  

### Artikel  7  

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, en de gevangenhoudende Mogendheden in het bijzonder, zullen, voor zover mogelijk en met inachtneming van de voorschriften betreffende de voedselvoorziening van de bevolking, alle aankopen toestaan, welke op haar grondgebied mochten worden gedaan ten einde collectieve zendingen aan de geinterneerden te doen toekomen; zij zullen op overeenkomstige wijze de overmaking van gelden en het nemen van andere financiële, technische of administratieve maatregelen met het oog op deze aankopen vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  8  

De voorgaande bepalingen maken geen inbreuk op het recht van geïnterneerden om collectieve zendingen te ontvangen vóór hun aankomst in een interneringsoord of gedurende overbrenging, noch op de mogelijkheid voor vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende Mogendheid, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of enige andere organisatie tot hulpverlening aan geïnterneerden, die belast mocht zijn met het verzenden van deze zendingen, om de uitdeling daarvan aan de geadresseerden te verzekeren met alle andere middelen welke zij geschikt mochten achten.
