internationaal recht, het soevereine recht hebben hun eigen hulpbronnen te exploiteren overeenkomstig hun eigen milieu- en ontwikkelingsbeleid, alsook de verantwoordelijkheid te verzekeren dat activiteiten die binnen hun rechtsmacht of toezicht vallen geen schade veroorzaken aan het milieu van andere Staten of van gebieden die onder geen enkele nationale rechtsmacht vallen, Erkennend dat de nationale Regeringen een beslissende rol vervullen bij de bestrijding van woestijnvorming en het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte en dat vooruitgang op dit gebied afhangt van de plaatselijke uitvoering van actieprogramma's in de getroffen gebieden, Tevens erkennend het belang en de noodzaak van internationale samenwerking en partnerschap bij de bestrijding van woestijnvorming en het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte, Erkennend het belang van de verstrekking aan de getroffen ontwikkelingslanden, in het bijzonder in Afrika, van doeltreffende middelen, onder andere aanzienlijke financiële middelen, waaronder nieuwe en aanvullende financiering, en toegang tot technologie, zonder welke het voor hen moeilijk zal zijn hun verplichtingen ingevolge dit Verdrag volledig na te komen, Uiting gevend aan de bezorgdheid over de effecten van woestijnvorming en droogte op de getroffen landen in Centraal-Azië en het Transkaukasisch gebied, Onderstrepend de belangrijke rol die

verband tussen woestijnvorming en andere milieuproblemen van mondiale omvang waarmee de internationale en nationale gemeenschappen worden geconfronteerd, Tevens indachtig de bijdrage die de bestrijding van woestijnvorming kan leveren aan de verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van het Raamverdrag van de Verenigde Naties inzake klimaatverandering, het Verdrag inzake biologische diversiteit en andere hiermee verband houdende milieuverdragen, Van oordeel zijnde dat strategieën voor het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte het meest doeltreffend zijn indien deze zijn gebaseerd op degelijke systematische waarneming en grondige wetenschappelijke kennis en indien deze voortdurend opnieuw worden geëvalueerd, Erkennend de dringende noodzaak van verbetering van de doelmatigheid en de coördinatie van de internationale samenwerking teneinde de uitvoering van nationale plannen en prioriteiten te vergemakkelijken, Vastbesloten bij het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte passende maatregelen te treffen ten behoeve van huidige en toekomstige generaties, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

e. bestaande fondsen en financiële mechanismen op subregionaal en regionaal niveau, in het bijzonder in Afrika, verbeteren om de uitvoering van het Verdrag doeltreffender te ondersteunen.     
2.  De Conferentie van de Partijen stimuleert tevens, via diverse mechanismen binnen het stelsel van de Verenigde Naties en via multilaterale financiële instellingen, het bieden van ondersteuning op nationaal, subregionaal en regionaal niveau aan activiteiten die de Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn in staat stellen om aan hun verplichtingen ingevolge het Verdrag te voldoen.   
3.  De Partijen die getroffen ontwikkelingslanden zijn, dienen gebruik te maken van nationale coördinerende mechanismen en, indien nodig, deze op te zetten en/of te verbeteren, geïntegreerd in nationale ontwikkelingsprogramma's, die zouden kunnen zorgen voor een efficiënt gebruik van alle beschikbare financiële middelen. Zij dienen tevens gebruik te maken van op participatie gebaseerde processen waarbij niet-gouvernementele organisaties, plaatselijke groepen en de particuliere sector zijn betrokken, bij het werven van fondsen, bij het tot stand brengen en uitvoeren van programma's en bij het garanderen van toegang tot financieringsmogelijkheden voor groepen op plaatselijk niveau. Deze maatregelen kan kracht worden bijgezet door middel van betere coördinatie en flexibele planning van de kant van hen die hulp bieden.   
4.  Teneinde de doeltreffendheid en efficiency van bestaande financiële mechanismen te verbeteren, wordt hierbij een Mondiaal Mechanisme ingesteld ter bevordering van maatregelen die zijn gericht op het beschikbaar (doen) stellen en doorsluizen van financiële middelen, mede voor de overdracht van technologie, bij wijze van giften en/of op concessionele of andere voorwaarden, naar de Partijen die getroffen ontwikkelingslanden zijn. Dit Mondiale Mechanisme werkt in opdracht onder leiding van de Conferentie van de Partijen en is daaraan verantwoording verschuldigd.   
5.  De Conferentie van de Partijen zoekt op haar eerste gewone zitting een organisatie waarbij het Mondiale Mechanisme wordt ondergebracht. De Conferentie van de Partijen en de door haar bereid gevonden organisatie komen de modaliteiten voor dit Mondiale Mechanisme overeen om ervoor te zorgen dat dit Mechanisme, onder andere:

### Bijlage  I  

####Bijlage inzake regionale uitvoering voor Afrika

### Artikel  1  

####Werkingssfeer

Deze Bijlage is van toepassing op Afrika, met betrekking tot elke Partij en in overeenstemming met het Verdrag, in het bijzonder artikel 7 daarvan, met het oog op het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en/of het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte in aride, semi-aride en droge subhumide gebieden in Afrika.  

### Artikel  2  

####Doel

Deze Bijlage heeft tot doel op nationaal, subregionaal en regionaal niveau in Afrika en gelet op de bijzondere omstandigheden van Afrika: 

a. maatregelen en regelingen vast te stellen, met inbegrip van de aard en processen van de hulp geboden door de Partijen die ontwikkelde landen zijn, in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende bepalingen van het Verdrag;  

b. te voorzien in de doeltreffende en praktische toepassing van het Verdrag, gericht op het aanpakken van omstandigheden die eigen zijn aan Afrika, en  

c. processen en activiteiten te bevorderen met betrekking tot het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en/of het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte in aride, semi-aride en droge subhumide gebieden in Afrika.    

### Artikel  3  

####Bijzondere omstandigheden van de Afrikaanse regio

Bij de nakoming van hun verplichtingen ingevolge dit Verdrag nemen de Partijen, ter uitvoering van deze Bijlage, een fundamentele aanpak aan, waarbij de volgende bijzondere omstandigheden van Afrika in aanmerking worden genomen: 

a. de in verhouding grote omvang van de aride, semi-aride en droge subhumide gebieden;  

b. het aanzienlijke aantal landen en bevolkingsgroepen die nadelige gevolgen ondervinden van woestijnvorming en het regelmatig voorkomen van ernstige droogte;  

c. het grote aantal getroffen landen die geen zeekust hebben;  

d. de alom heersende armoede in de meeste getroffen landen, het grote aantal minstontwikkelde landen daaronder en hun behoefte aan aanzienlijke bedragen aan buitenlandse hulp in de vorm van giften en zachte leningen, teneinde hun ontwikkelingsdoelstellingen na te streven;  

e. de moeilijke sociaal-economische omstandigheden, verergerd door een verslechterende en schommelende ruilvoet, de buitenlandse schuldenlast en politieke instabiliteit, hetgeen leidt tot binnenlandse, regionale en internationale migratie;  

f. de grote afhankelijkheid van bevolkingsgroepen van natuurlijke rijkdommen voor hun middelen van bestaan die, gecompliceerd door de effecten van demografische tendensen en factoren, een zwakke technologische basis en niet-duurzame produktiewijzen, bijdraagt tot een ernstige achteruitgang van de hulpbronnen;  

g. de ontoereikende institutionele en wettelijke kaders, de zwakke infrastructurele basis en de ontoereikende wetenschappelijke, technische en onderwijscapaciteit, hetgeen wezenlijke behoeften qua capaciteitsvergroting met zich meebrengt; en  

h. de centrale rol van maatregelen gericht op het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en/of het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte in de nationale ontwikkelingsprioriteiten van getroffen landen in Afrika.    

### Artikel  4  

####Verplichtingen van de Partijen die landen in Afrika zijn

1.  Overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden mogelijkheden, verplichten de Partijen die landen in Afrika zijn zich ertoe: 

a. het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en/of het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte te kiezen als centrale strategie in hun inspanningen gericht op armoedebestrijding;  

b. regionale samenwerking en integratie, in een geest van solidariteit en partnerschap gebaseerd op wederzijds belang, in programma's en activiteiten gericht op het bestrijden van woestijnvorming en/of het inperken van de gevolgen van droogte, te bevorderen;  

c. de bestaande instellingen die zich met woestijnvorming en droogte bezighouden, te rationaliseren en te versterken en andere bestaande instellingen, voor zover van toepassing, daarbij te betrekken, teneinde deze doeltreffender te maken en te zorgen voor een efficiënt gebruik van de middelen;  

d. de onderlinge uitwisseling van informatie over geschikte technologie, kennis, know-how en werkwijzen te bevorderen; en
