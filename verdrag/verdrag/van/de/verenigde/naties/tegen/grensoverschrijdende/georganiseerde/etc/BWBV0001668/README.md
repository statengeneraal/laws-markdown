For the purposes of article 16, paragraph 10, of this Convention, each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences covered by this Convention when the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite such person solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals.   
4.  Each State Party may also adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences covered by this Convention when the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him or her.   
5.  If a State Party exercising its jurisdiction under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article has been notified, or has otherwise learned, that one or more other States Parties are conducting an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding in respect of the same conduct, the competent authorities of those States Parties shall, as appropriate, consult one another with a view to coordinating their actions.   
6.  Without prejudice to norms of general international law, this Convention does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a State Party in accordance with its domestic law.   

### Article  16  

####Extradition

1.  This article shall apply to the offences covered by this Convention or in cases where an offence referred to in article 3, paragraph 1 a) or b), involves an organized criminal group and the person who is the subject of the request for extradition is located in the territory of the requested State Party, provided that the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable under the domestic law of both the requesting State Party and the requested State Party.   
2.  If the request for extradition includes several separate serious crimes, some of which are not covered by this article, the requested State Party may apply this article also in respect of the latter offences.   
3.  Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.   
4.  If a State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention the legal basis for extradition in respect of any offence to which this article applies.   
5.  States Parties that make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall: 

a) At the time of deposit of their instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether they will take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition with other States Parties to this Convention; and  

b) If they do not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition, seek, where appropriate, to conclude treaties on extradition with other States Parties to this Convention in order to implement this article.     
6.  States Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize offences to which this article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.   
7.  Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, conditions in relation to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition.   
8.  States Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating thereto in respect of any offence to which this article applies.   
9.  Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested State Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent and at the request of the requesting State Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his or her presence at extradition proceedings.   
10.  A State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does not extradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article applies solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at the request of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the domestic law of that State Party. The States Parties concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution.   
11.  Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought and that State Party and the State Party seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem appropriate, such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 10 of this article.   
12.  If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because the person sought is a national of the requested State Party, the requested Party shall, if its domestic law so permits and in conformity with the requirements of such law, upon application of the requesting Party, consider the enforcement of the sentence that has been imposed under the domestic law of the requesting Party or the remainder thereof.   
13.  Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with any of the offences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the domestic law of the State Party in the territory of which that person is present.   
14.  Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any one of these reasons.   
15.  States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.   
16.  Before refusing extradition, the requested State Party shall, where appropriate, consult with the requesting State Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present its opinions and to provide information relevant to its allegation.   
17.  States Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements or arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition.   

### Article  17  

####Transfer of sentenced persons

States Parties may consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements on the transfer to their territory of persons sentenced to imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty for offences covered by this Convention, in order that they may complete their sentences there.  

### Article  18  

####Mutual legal assistance

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by this Convention as provided for in article 3 and shall reciprocally extend to one another similar assistance where the requesting State Party has reasonable grounds to suspect that the offence referred to in article 3, paragraph 1 a) or b), is transnational in nature, including that victims, witnesses, proceeds, instrumentalities or evidence of such offences are located in the requested State Party and that the offence involves an organized criminal group.   
2.  Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible under relevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the requested State Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences for which a legal person may be held liable in accordance with article 10 of this Convention in the requesting State Party.

h) Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting State Party;  

i) Any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law of the requested State Party.     
4.

5.  The transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent authorities providing the information. The competent authorities receiving the information shall comply with a request that said information remain confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its use. However, this shall not prevent the receiving State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information that is exculpatory to an accused person. In such a case, the receiving State Party shall notify the transmitting State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the transmitting State Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the receiving State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay.   
6.  The provisions of this article shall not affect the obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance.   
7.  Paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant to this article if the States Parties in question are not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If those States Parties are bound by such a treaty, the corresponding provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the States Parties agree to apply paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article in lieu thereof. States Parties are strongly encouraged to apply these paragraphs if they facilitate cooperation.   
8.  States Parties shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of bank secrecy.   
9.  States Parties may decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of absence of dual criminality. However, the requested State Party may, when it deems appropriate, provide assistance, to the extent it decides at its discretion, irrespective of whether the conduct would constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State Party.   
10.

13.  Each State Party shall designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility and power to receive requests for mutual legal assistance and either to execute them or to transmit them to the competent authorities for execution. Where a State Party has a special region or territory with a separate system of mutual legal assistance, it may designate a distinct central authority that shall have the same function for that region or territory. Central authorities shall ensure the speedy and proper execution or transmission of the requests received. Where the central authority transmits the request to a competent authority for execution, it shall encourage the speedy and proper execution of the request by the competent authority. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the central authority designated for this purpose at the time each State Party deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of or accession to this Convention. Requests formutual legal assistance and any communication related thereto shall be transmitted to the central authorities designated by the States Parties.

19.  The requesting State Party shall not transmit or use information or evidence furnished by the requested State Party for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings other than those stated in the request without the prior consent of the requested State Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the requesting State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evidence that is exculpatory to an accused person.

If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the requesting State Party shall inform the requested State Party of the disclosure without delay.   
20.  The requesting State Party may require that the requested State Party keeps confidential the fact and substance of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the requested State Party cannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting State Party.   
21.  Mutual legal assistance may be refused: 

a) If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this article;  

b) If the requested State Party considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests;  

c) If the authorities of the requested State Party would be prohibited by its domestic law from carrying out the action requested with regard to any similar offence, had it been subject to investigation, prosecution or judicial proceedings under their own jurisdiction;  

d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State Party relating to mutual legal assistance for the request to be granted.

Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert or other person having had, for a period of fifteen consecutive days or for any period agreed upon by the States Parties from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities, an opportunity of leaving, has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting State Party or, having left it, has returned of his or her own free will.   
28.  The ordinary costs of executing a request shall be borne by the requested State Party, unless otherwise agreed by the States Parties concerned.

3.  Ten aanzien van de overeenkomstig de artikelen 5, 6, 8 en 23 van dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten, neemt elke Staat die partij is passende maatregelen in overeenstemming met zijn nationale recht en met zorgvuldige inachtneming van de rechten van de verdediging, ter nastreving van het verzekeren dat bij de voorwaarden opgelegd in verband met beslissingen inzake vrijlating in afwachting van het proces of hoger beroep rekening wordt gehouden met de noodzaak tot verzekering van de aanwezigheid van de verdachte tijdens de daarop volgende strafrechtelijke procedures.

De Staten die partij zijn, kunnen de mogelijkheid overwegen te eisen dat een dader de rechtmatige herkomst aantoont van vermeende opbrengsten van misdaad of andere goederen die onderhevig zijn aan confiscatie, voorzover een dergelijke eis verenigbaar is met de beginselen van hun nationale recht en met de aard van de gerechtelijke en andere procedures.   
8.  De bepalingen van dit artikel mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat zij afbreuk doen aan de rechten van derden die te goeder trouw zijn.   
9.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel tast het beginsel aan dat de maatregelen waarnaar het verwijst worden vastgesteld en uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met en met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het nationale recht van een Staat die partij is.

a. het strafbare feit wordt gepleegd tegen een onderdaan van die Staat die partij is;  

b. het strafbare feit wordt gepleegd door een onderdaan van die Staat die partij is of door een staatloze die zijn of haar vaste woon- of verblijfplaats heeft op zijn grondgebied; of  

c. het strafbare feit 

i. behoort tot de overeenkomstig artikel 5, eerste lid, van dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten en wordt gepleegd buiten zijn grondgebied met het oogmerk een ernstig misdrijf op zijn grondgebied te plegen;  

ii. behoort tot de overeenkomstig artikel 6, eerste lid, onderdeel b, ii, van dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten en wordt gepleegd buiten zijn grondgebied met het oogmerk een overeenkomstig artikel 6, eerste lid, onderdeel a, i of ii, of onderdeel b, i, van dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit te plegen op zijn grondgebied.       
3.  Voor de toepassing van artikel 16, tiende lid, van dit Verdrag, neemt elke Staat die partij is de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn rechtsmacht te vestigen met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, indien de vermeende dader zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt en hij die persoon niet uitlevert uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat hij of zij zijn onderdaan is.   
4.  Elke Staat die partij is, kan tevens de maatregelen nemen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn rechtsmacht te vestigen met betrekking tot strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, wanneer de vermeende dader zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt en hij hem of haar niet uitlevert.   
5.  Indien een Staat die partij is die zijn rechtsmacht uitoefent uit hoofde van het eerste of tweede lid van dit artikel ervan in kennis is gesteld of op andere wijze heeft vernomen dat één of meer andere Staten die partij zijn een opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure heeft of hebben ingesteld naar aanleiding van dezelfde handelingen, overleggen de bevoegde autoriteiten van die Staten die partij zijn, waar mogelijk, met elkaar teneinde hun maatregelen te coördineren.   
6.  Onverminderd de normen van het algemene internationale recht, sluit dit Verdrag de uitoefening van geen enkele rechtsmacht in strafrechtelijke aangelegenheden uit die een Staat die partij is in overeenstemming met zijn nationale wetgeving heeft gevestigd.   

### Artikel  16  

####Uitlevering

1.  Dit artikel is van toepassing op de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen of in de gevallen waarin een criminele organisatie betrokken is bij een strafbaar feit als bedoeld in artikel 3, eerste lid, onderdeel a of b en de persoon die het voorwerp is van het verzoek om uitlevering zich bevindt op het grondgebied van de aangezochte Staat die partij is, mits het strafbare feit waarvoor om uitlevering wordt verzocht, strafbaar is ingevolge het nationale recht van zowel de verzoekende Staat die partij is als de aangezochte Staat die partij is.   
2.  Indien het verzoek om uitlevering diverse afzonderlijke ernstige misdrijven omvat, waarvan sommige niet onder dit artikel vallen, kan de aangezochte Staat die partij is dit artikel ook toepassen ten aanzien van de laatstgenoemde strafbare feiten.   
3.  Elk van de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt geacht te zijn opgenomen als een uitleveringsdelict in elk tussen de Staten die partij zijn bestaand uitleveringsverdrag. De Staten die partij zijn verplichten zich ertoe bedoelde strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder tussen hen te sluiten uitleveringsverdrag.   
4.  Indien een Staat die partij is die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die partij is waarmee hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan hij dit Verdrag beschouwen als rechtsgrondslag voor uitlevering wat betreft de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is.   
5.  De Staten die partij zijn die uitlevering afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag: 

a. stellen bij de nederlegging van hun akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties ervan in kennis of zij dit Verdrag hanteren als de rechtsgrondslag voor medewerking aan uitlevering met andere Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag; en  

b. trachten, indien zij dit Verdrag niet hanteren als de rechtsgrondslag voor medewerking aan uitlevering, indien nodig, verdragen inzake uitlevering te sluiten met andere Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag teneinde dit artikel uit te voeren.     
6.  Staten die partij zijn die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag erkennen onderling de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is als uitleveringsdelicten.   
7.  Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de voorwaarden voorzien in het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is of in toepasselijke uitleveringsverdragen, met inbegrip van, onder andere, voorwaarden met betrekking tot de straf die minimaal vereist is voor uitlevering en de gronden waarop de aangezochte Staat die partij is uitlevering kan weigeren.   
8.  De Staten die partij zijn, trachten met inachtneming van hun nationale recht uitleveringsprocedures te bespoedigen en de vereisten betreffende de bewijslevering in dergelijke procedures te vereenvoudigen ten aanzien van elk strafbaar feit waarop dit artikel van toepassing is.   
9.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van zijn nationale wetgeving en zijn uitleveringsverdragen, kan de aangezochte Staat die partij is, nadat hij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden dit rechtvaardigen en dringend zijn en naar aanleiding van het verzoek van de verzoekende Staat die partij is, een persoon om wiens uitlevering wordt verzocht en die zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt in hechtenis nemen of andere passende maatregelen nemen om zijn of haar aanwezigheid bij de uitleveringsprocedure te verzekeren.   
10.  Een Staat die partij is op wiens grondgebied een vermeende dader wordt aangetroffen, is, indien hij een dergelijk persoon uitsluitend op grond van het feit hij of zij zijn onderdaan is niet uitlevert vanwege een strafbaar feit waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, verplicht om op verzoek van de uitleveringverzoekende Staat die partij is de zaak zonder onnodige vertraging voor te leggen aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten ten behoeve van vervolging. Die autoriteiten nemen hun besluit en voeren hun procedures op dezelfde wijze uit als in het geval van andere ernstige strafbare feiten ingevolge het nationale recht van die Staat die partij is. De betrokken Staten die partij zijn, werken met elkaar samen, in het bijzonder op het gebied van procedures en bewijs, teneinde de doelmatigheid van de vervolging te verzekeren.   
11.  Wanneer het een Staat die partij is op grond van zijn nationale recht alleen is toegestaan een onderdaan uit te leveren of op andere wijze over te geven onder de voorwaarde dat deze wordt teruggezonden naar die Staat die partij is om de straf te ondergaan die is opgelegd als gevolg van het proces of de procedure waarvoor om uitlevering of overgave van de persoon werd verzocht, en deze Staat die partij is en de om uitlevering van de persoon verzoekende Staat die partij is, instemmen met deze optie en andere voorwaarden die zij gepast achten, is een dergelijke voorwaardelijke uitlevering of overgave voldoende voor ontheffing van de in het tiende lid omschreven verplichting.   
12.  Indien een uitlevering, waarom wordt verzocht ten behoeve van de tenuitvoerlegging van een vonnis, wordt geweigerd omdat de gezochte persoon onderdaan is van de aangezochte Staat die partij is, neemt de aangezochte Partij, indien haar nationale recht dat toestaat en overeenkomstig de vereisten van dat recht, op aanvraag van de verzoekende Partij de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis dat is gewezen krachtens het nationale recht van de verzoekende Partij, of van het resterende deel daarvan in overweging.   
13.  Elke persoon ten aanzien van wie procedures worden gevoerd in verband met een van de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt een eerlijke behandeling in alle fasen van het proces verzekerd, met inbegrip van het genot van alle rechten en waarborgen die zijn voorzien in het nationale recht van de Staat die partij is op het grondgebied waarvan die persoon zich bevindt.   
14.  Niets in dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat het een verplichting tot uitlevering zou inhouden indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is ernstige redenen heeft aan te nemen dat het verzoek om uitlevering is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te straffen op grond van zijn geslacht, ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, etnische afkomst of politieke overtuiging of dat inwilliging van het verzoek de positie van die persoon om een van deze redenen ongunstig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.   
15.  De Staten die partij zijn, mogen een verzoek om uitlevering niet afwijzen uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat het strafbare feit geacht wordt tevens fiscale aangelegenheden te omvatten.   
16.  Alvorens uitlevering te weigeren, overlegt de aangezochte Staat die partij is, indien nodig, met de verzoekende Staat die partij is om hem ruimschoots in de gelegenheid te stellen zijn opvattingen te presenteren en informatie te verstrekken ter staving van zijn beweringen.   
17.  De Staten die partij zijn, streven ernaar bilaterale en multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen te sluiten om uitlevering mogelijk te maken of de doeltreffendheid ervan te verhogen.   

### Artikel  17  

####Overbrenging van gevonniste personen

Staten die partij zijn, kunnen overwegen bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen te sluiten voor de overbrenging naar hun grondgebied van personen die zijn veroordeeld tot gevangenisstraf of andere vormen van vrijheidsbeneming voor strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen opdat zij het resterende deel van hun straf daar kunnen uitzitten.  

### Artikel  18  

####Wederzijdse rechtshulp

1.  De Staten die partij zijn, verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke wederzijdse rechtshulp bij opsporing, vervolging en gerechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen zoals voorzien in artikel 3, en verlenen elkaar wederzijds vergelijkbare hulp indien de verzoekende Staat die partij is redelijke gronden heeft om aan te nemen dat het in artikel 3, eerste lid, onderdeel a of b bedoelde strafbare feit van grensoverschrijdende aard is, alsmede dat de slachtoffers, getuigen, opbrengsten, hulpmiddelen of bewijsstukken van dergelijke strafbare feiten zich bevinden in de aangezochte Staat die partij is en dat een criminele organisatie bij het strafbare feit betrokken is.   
2.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp wordt verleend in de ruimst mogelijke mate krachtens de relevante wetten, verdragen, overeenkomsten en regelingen van de aangezochte Staat die partij is met betrekking tot opsporing, vervolging en gerechtelijke procedures ten aanzien van de strafbare feiten waarvoor een rechtspersoon aansprakelijk kan worden gesteld overeenkomstig artikel 10 van dit Verdrag in de verzoekende Staat die partij is.   
3.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp die moet worden verleend overeenkomstig dit artikel kan worden verzocht voor elk van de volgende doeleinden: 

a. het opmaken van getuigenissen en verklaringen van personen;  

b. het betekenen van gerechtelijke documenten;  

c. het uitvoeren van huiszoekingen en inbeslagnemingen, alsmede bevriezing;  

d. de opsporingen van goederen en terreinen;  

e. het verschaffen van informatie, stukken van overtuiging en beoordelingen door deskundigen;  

f. het verstrekken van originelen of gewaarmerkte afschriften van relevante documenten en dossiers, met inbegrip van bancaire, financiële, bedrijfs- of zakelijke dossiers;  

g. het identificeren of opsporen van opbrengsten van misdaad, goederen, hulpmiddelen of andere goederen ten behoeve van bewijsvoering;  

h. het vergemakkelijken van de vrijwillige verschijning van personen in de verzoekende Staat die partij is;  

i. elke andere vorm van hulp die niet in strijd is met het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is.     
4.  Onverminderd het nationale recht, kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Staat die partij is, zonder voorafgaand verzoek, informatie met betrekking tot criminele aangelegenheden zenden aan een bevoegde autoriteit in een andere Staat die partij is, indien zij aannemen dat deze informatie de autoriteit zou kunnen helpen bij het instellen of succesvol afsluiten van onderzoeken en strafrechtelijke procedures of zou kunnen leiden tot het formuleren van een verzoek krachtens dit Verdrag door de laatstgenoemde Staat die partij is.   
5.  De verzending van informatie ingevolge het vierde lid van dit artikel laat onderzoeken en strafrechtelijke procedures in de Staat van de bevoegde autoriteiten die de informatie verstrekken onverlet. De bevoegde autoriteiten die de informatie ontvangen, willigen een verzoek in om de genoemde informatie geheim te houden, ook tijdelijk, of beperkingen te stellen aan het gebruik ervan. Dit belet de ontvangende Staat die partij is evenwel niet tijdens zijn procedures informatie te verstrekken die ontlastend is voor een verdachte. In een dergelijk geval stelt de Staat die partij is de verzendende Staat die partij is voorafgaand aan de verstrekking daarvan in kennis, en overlegt, indien daarom is verzocht, met de verzendende Staat die partij is. Indien in een uitzonderlijk geval voorafgaande kennisgeving niet mogelijk is, stelt de ontvangende Staat die partij is de verzendende Staat die partij is onverwijld op de hoogte van de verstrekking.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel tasten de verplichtingen ingevolge een ander bilateraal of multilateraal verdrag dat wederzijdse rechtshulp geheel of ten dele regelt of zal regelen niet aan.   
7.  Het negende tot en met het negenentwintigste lid van dit artikel zijn van toepassing op ingevolge dit artikel gedane verzoeken indien de betrokken Staten die partij zijn niet gebonden worden door een verdrag inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp. Indien deze Staten die partij zijn gebonden zijn door een dergelijk verdrag, zijn de desbetreffende bepalingen van dat verdrag van toepassing, tenzij de Staten die partij zijn, overeenkomen in plaats daarvan het negende tot en met het negenentwintigste lid van dit artikel toe te passen. De Staten die partij zijn, worden sterk aangemoedigd deze leden toe te passen indien zij de samenwerking vergemakkelijken.   
8.  De Staten die partij zijn, weigeren niet wederzijdse rechtshulp ingevolge dit artikel te verlenen op grond van het bankgeheim.   
9.  De Staten die partij zijn, mogen weigeren wederzijdse rechtshulp ingevolge dit artikel te verlenen op grond van het ontbreken van dubbele strafbaarheid. De aangezochte Staat die partij is, kan evenwel, indien hij dit passend acht, rechtshulp verlenen in de door hem te bepalen mate, ongeacht of de handeling een strafbaar feit zou opleveren volgens het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is.   
10.  Een persoon die in hechtenis zit of een straf ondergaat op het grondgebied van een Staat die partij is, om wiens aanwezigheid op het grondgebied van een andere Staat die partij is wordt verzocht voor identificatie, verhoor of andere wijze van medewerking voor de verkrijging van bewijs voor opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, mag worden overgebracht, indien wordt voldaan aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. de persoon geeft vrijwillig zijn of haar toestemming op basis van volledige informatie;  

b. de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten die partij zijn, stemmen ermee in, overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die die Staten die partij zijn eventueel gepast achten.     
11.  Voor de toepassing van het tiende lid van dit artikel: 

a. is de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht bevoegd en verplicht de overgebrachte persoon in hechtenis te houden, tenzij hij anderszins verzocht of gemachtigd wordt door de Staat die partij is van waaruit de persoon is overgebracht;  

b. komt de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht onverwijld zijn verplichting na tot terugzending van de persoon voor inhechtenisneming door de Staat die partij is van waaruit deze persoon is overgebracht zoals vooraf overeengekomen, of op andere wijze overeengekomen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten die partij zijn;  

c. verlangt de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht niet van de Staat die partij is van waaruit de persoon is overgebracht dat deze een uitleveringsprocedure begint ten behoeve van de terugkeer van de persoon;  

d. krijgt de overgebrachte persoon vermindering van de straf die hij of zij in de Staat vanwaar hij of zij is overgebracht moet uitzitten met de periode die hij of zij in hechtenis heeft doorgebracht in de Staat die partij is waarnaar hij of zij is overgebracht.     
12.  Tenzij de Staat die partij is van waaruit een persoon overeenkomstig het tiende en elfde lid van dit artikel moet worden overgebracht daarvoor toestemming geeft, wordt die persoon, ongeacht zijn of haar nationaliteit, niet vervolgd of in hechtenis genomen, noch aan enige andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid onderworpen op het grondgebied van de Staat waarnaar deze persoon wordt overgebracht wegens handelen, nalaten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de Staat van waaruit deze persoon is overgebracht.   
13.  Elke Staat die partij is, wijst een centrale autoriteit aan die de verantwoordelijkheid draagt voor en bevoegd is tot het ontvangen van verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp en deze ofwel uit te voeren ofwel ter uitvoering te zenden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten. Indien een Staat die partij is een speciale regio of speciaal grondgebied heeft met een afzonderlijk stelsel voor wederzijdse rechtshulp, kan hij een aparte centrale autoriteit aanwijzen die dezelfde functie vervult voor die regio of dat grondgebied. De centrale autoriteiten verzekeren de spoedige en goede uitvoering of verzending van de ontvangen verzoeken. Indien de centrale autoriteit het verzoek ter uitvoering aan een bevoegde autoriteit zendt, moedigt zij de spoedige en goede uitvoering van het verzoek door de bevoegde autoriteit aan. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties wordt in kennis gesteld van de voor dit doel aangewezen centrale autoriteit op het tijdstip van nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag door elke Staat die partij is. De verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp en mededelingen die daarmee verband houden worden gezonden aan de door de Staten die partij zijn aangewezen centrale autoriteiten. Dit vereiste geldt onverminderd het recht van een Staat die partij is te verlangen dat dergelijke verzoeken en mededelingen langs diplomatieke weg aan hem worden gericht en, in geval van nood, indien de Staten die partij zijn dat overeenkomen, zo mogelijk door tussenkomst van de Internationale Criminele Politieorganisatie.   
14.  De verzoeken worden schriftelijk gedaan, of waar mogelijk met elk middel waarmee een schriftelijk document kan worden geproduceerd, in een voor de aangezochte Staat die partij is aanvaardbare taal, onder voorwaarden die het die Staat die partij is mogelijk maken de authenticiteit vast te stellen. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties wordt in kennis gesteld van de voor elke Staat die partij is aanvaardbare taal of talen op het tijdstip van de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag door elke Staat die partij is. In geval van nood en indien overeengekomen door de Staten die partij zijn, kunnen verzoeken mondeling worden gedaan, maar dienen zij onverwijld schriftelijk te worden bevestigd.   
15.  Een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp bevat: 

a. de identiteit van de autoriteit die het verzoek doet;  

b. het onderwerp en de aard van de opsporing, de vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft en de naam en functies van de autoriteit die de opsporing, de vervolging of de gerechtelijke procedure uitvoert;  

c. een samenvatting van de relevante feiten, met uitzondering van verzoeken ten behoeve van de betekening van gerechtelijke documenten;  

d. een beschrijving van de gewenste rechtshulp en de details van de specifieke procedure waarvan de verzoekende Staat die partij is wenst dat die gevolgd wordt;  

e. waar mogelijk de identiteit, het adres en nationaliteit van de betrokken personen; en  

f. het doel waarvoor om het bewijsmateriaal, de informatie of de maatregelen wordt verzocht.     
16.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is, kan verzoeken om aanvullende informatie indien deze noodzakelijk blijkt voor de uitvoering van het verzoek overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht of wanneer deze de uitvoering kan vergemakkelijken.   
17.  Een verzoek wordt uitgevoerd overeenkomstig het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is en, voorzover niet in strijd met het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is, en waar mogelijk, overeenkomstig de in het verzoek omschreven procedures.   
18.  Indien een persoon zich op het grondgebied van een Staat die partij is bevindt en als getuige of deskundige gehoord moet worden door de gerechtelijke autoriteiten van een andere Staat die partij is, kan de eerste Staat die partij is, op verzoek van de andere, waar mogelijk en overeenkomstig de grondbeginselen van het nationale recht, toestaan dat het verhoor plaatsvindt door middel van videoconferencing, indien het voor de persoon in kwestie niet mogelijk of wenselijk is persoonlijk te verschijnen op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is. De Staten die partij zijn, kunnen overeenkomen dat het verhoor wordt uitgevoerd door een gerechtelijke autoriteit van de verzoekende Staat die partij is en wordt bijgewoond door een gerechtelijke autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat die partij is.   
19.  De verzoekende Staat die partij is, gebruikt of zendt geen informatie of bewijsmateriaal verstrekt door de aangezochte Staat die partij is voor opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures anders dan vermeld in het verzoek, zonder voorafgaande toestemming van de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Niets in dit lid belet de verzoekende Staat die partij is in zijn procedures informatie of bewijsmateriaal bekend te maken dat ontlastend is voor een verdachte. In het laatste geval stelt de verzoekende Staat die partij is de aangezochte Staat die partij is voorafgaand aan de bekendmaking daarvan in kennis, en overlegt, indien daarom is verzocht, met de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Indien in een uitzonderlijk geval voorafgaande kennisgeving niet mogelijk is, stelt de verzoekende Staat die partij is de aangezochte Staat die partij is onverwijld op de hoogte van de bekendmaking.   
20.  De verzoekende Staat die partij is, kan verlangen dat de aangezochte Staat die partij is het bestaan en de inhoud van het verzoek geheimhoudt, behalve voorzover bekendmaking nodig is voor de uitvoering van het verzoek. Indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is niet kan voldoen aan het vereiste van geheimhouding, stelt hij de verzoekende Staat die partij is daarvan onverwijld op de hoogte.   
21.  Wederzijdse rechtshulp kan worden geweigerd: 

a. indien het verzoek niet wordt gedaan overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel;  

b. indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is uitvoering van het verzoek schadelijk acht voor zijn soevereiniteit, veiligheid, openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen;  

c. indien het de autoriteiten van de aangezochte Staat die partij is krachtens zijn nationale recht verboden zou zijn de verzochte actie uit te voeren ten behoeve van een vergelijkbaar strafbaar feit, indien het onder hun eigen rechtsmacht zou worden onderworpen aan onderzoek, vervolging of een gerechtelijke procedure;  

d. indien het in strijd zou zijn met het rechtsstelsel van de aangezochte Staat die partij is met betrekking tot wederzijdse rechtshulp om het verzoek te honoreren.     
22.  De Staten die partij zijn, mogen een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp niet afwijzen uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat het strafbare feit geacht wordt tevens fiscale aangelegenheden te omvatten.   
23.  Elke weigering van wederzijdse rechtshulp wordt met redenen omkleed.   
24.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is, voert het verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp zo spoedig mogelijk uit en houdt zoveel mogelijk rekening met eventuele uiterste termijnen die door de verzoekende Staat die partij is zijn vermeld en die met redenen zijn omkleed, bij voorkeur in het verzoek. De aangezochte Staat die partij is, antwoordt op redelijke verzoeken van de verzoekende Staat die partij is om informatie over de voortgang van de behandeling van het verzoek. De verzoekende Staat die partij is, stelt de aangezochte Staat die partij is onverwijld in kennis indien de verzochte rechtshulp niet langer nodig is.   
25.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp kan door de aangezochte Staat die partij is worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat een lopend onderzoek, lopende vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure hierdoor wordt doorkruist.   
26.  Alvorens een verzoek ingevolge het eenentwintigste lid van dit artikel te weigeren of de uitvoering ervan uit te stellen ingevolge het vijfentwintigste lid van dit artikel, overlegt de aangezochte Staat die partij is met de verzoekende Staat die partij is om te overwegen of rechtshulp kan worden verleend onder de door hem nodig geachte voorwaarden en bepalingen. Indien de verzoekende Staat die partij is rechtshulp aanvaardt onder die voorwaarden, dient hij daaraan te voldoen.   
27.  Onverminderd de toepassing van het twaalfde lid van dit artikel, wordt een getuige, deskundige of andere persoon die op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat die partij is ermee instemt te getuigen in een procedure of mee te werken aan een onderzoek, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is, niet vervolgd, in hechtenis genomen, gestraft of onderworpen aan een andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid op dat grondgebied ten aanzien van handelen, nalaten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Een dergelijke immuniteit houdt op wanneer de getuige, deskundige of andere persoon gedurende vijftien achtereenvolgende dagen of gedurende een door de Staten die partij zijn overeengekomen tijdvak vanaf de datum waarop hij of zij officieel ervan in kennis is gesteld dat zijn of haar aanwezigheid niet langer verlangd wordt door de gerechtelijke autoriteiten, de mogelijkheid heeft gekregen te vertrekken, niettemin vrijwillig gebleven is op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is of, na te zijn vertrokken, vrijwillig is teruggekeerd.   
28.  De gewone kosten voor de uitvoering van een verzoek worden gedragen door de aangezochte Staat die partij is, tenzij anders is overeengekomen door de betrokken Staten die partij zijn. Indien met de uitvoering van het verzoek aanzienlijke kosten of kosten van buitengewone aard zijn of zullen zijn gemoeid, plegen de Staten die partij zijn overleg om de voorwaarden en omstandigheden te bepalen waaronder het verzoek zal worden uitgevoerd, alsmede de wijze waarop de kosten worden gedragen.   
29.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is: 

a. verstrekt aan de verzoekende Staat die partij is afschriften van overheidsdossiers, -documenten of -informatie waarover hij beschikt die krachtens zijn nationale wet toegankelijk zijn voor het algemene publiek;  

b. kan, naar eigen oordeel, aan de verzoekende Staat die partij is geheel of gedeeltelijk of onder door hem passend geachte voorwaarden, afschriften van overheidsdossiers, -documenten of -informatie waarover hij beschikt verstrekken die krachtens zijn nationale wet niet toegankelijk zijn voor het algemene publiek.     
30.  De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen, indien nodig, de mogelijkheid van het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen die dienstig zijn voor, praktische uitvoering geven aan of bevorderlijk zijn voor de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  19  

####Gezamenlijke opsporing

De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen op grond waarvan ten behoeve van aangelegenheden die het voorwerp zijn van opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures in een of meer Staten, de betrokken bevoegde autoriteiten gemeenschappelijke opsporingsinstanties kunnen oprichten. Bij het ontbreken van dergelijke overeenkomsten of regelingen, kunnen gezamenlijke opsporingen op ad hoc-basis worden overeengekomen. De betrokken Staten die partij zijn, verzekeren dat de soevereiniteit van de Staat die partij is op het grondgebied waarvan een dergelijke opsporing moet plaatsvinden volledig wordt geëerbiedigd.  

### Artikel  20  

####Speciale opsporingstechnieken

1.  Indien toegestaan volgens de grondbeginselen van zijn nationale rechtsstelsel, neemt elke Staat die partij is, binnen zijn mogelijkheden en onder de door zijn nationale recht voorgeschreven voorwaarden, de nodige maatregelen ten behoeve van het passend gebruik van gecontroleerde aflevering en, wanneer hij dat passend acht, voor het gebruik van andere speciale opsporingstechnieken, zoals elektronisch of andere vormen van toezicht en infiltratie-operaties, door zijn bevoegde autoriteiten op zijn grondgebied ten behoeve van de doeltreffende bestrijding van georganiseerde misdaad.   
2.  Ten behoeve van de opsporing van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, worden de Staten die partij zijn aangemoedigd, indien noodzakelijk, passende bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen te sluiten voor het gebruik van dergelijke speciale opsporingstechnieken in het kader van samenwerking op internationaal niveau. Deze overeenkomsten of regelingen worden gesloten en uitgevoerd onder volledige eerbiediging van het grondbeginsel van de soevereine gelijkheid van Staten en worden onder strikte naleving van de bepalingen van die overeenkomsten of regelingen uitgevoerd.   
3.  Bij het ontbreken van een overeenkomst of regeling als bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel, worden de beslissingen om die speciale opsporingstechnieken te gebruiken op internationaal niveau op ad-hoc basis genomen, waarbij zo nodig rekening wordt gehouden met financiële regelingen en akkoorden ten aanzien van de uitoefening van de rechtsmacht door de betrokken Staten die partij zijn.   
4.  De beslissingen over het gebruik van gecontroleerde aflevering op internationaal niveau kunnen, met de instemming van de betrokken Staten die partij zijn, methoden inhouden zoals het onderscheppen van goederen en het toestaan dat deze goederen intact worden gelaten of geheel of gedeeltelijk worden verwijderd of vervangen.   

### Artikel  21  

####Overdracht van strafvervolging

De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen de mogelijkheid strafvervolging aan elkaar over te dragen van een strafbaar feit dat onder dit Verdrag valt in de gevallen waarin een dergelijke overdracht geacht wordt in het belang te zijn van een goede rechtsbedeling, in het bijzonder in gevallen waarbij diverse jurisdicties betrokken zijn, teneinde de vervolging te concentreren.  

### Artikel  22  

####Opstelling van een strafblad
