### Convention  

####against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment

The States Parties to this Convention, Considering that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Recognizing that those rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person, Considering the obligation of States under the Charter, in particular article 55, to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms, Having regard to article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which provide that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Having regard also to the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 1975, Desiring to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world, Have agreed as follows:     
### PART  I  

### Article  1  

1.  For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.   
2.  This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.   

### Article  2  

1.  Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.   
2.  No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.   
3.  An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture.   

### Article  3  

1.  No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.   
2.  For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.   

### Article  4  

1.  Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture.   
2.  Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.   

### Article  5  

1.  Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases: 

(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;  

(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State;  

(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate.     
2.  Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article.   
3.  This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law.   

### Article  6  

1.  Upon being satisfied, after an examination of information available to it, that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in whose territory a person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in article 4 is present shall take him into custody or take other legal measures to ensure his presence. The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided in the law of that State but may be continued only for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted.   
2.  Such State shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts.   
3.  Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article shall be assisted in communicating immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national, or, if he is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he usually resides.   
4.  When a State, pursuant to this article, has taken a person into custody, it shall immediately notify the States referred to in article 5, paragraph 1, of the fact that such person is in custody and of the circumstances which warrant his detention. The State which makes the preliminary inquiry contemplated in paragraph 2 of this article shall promptly report its findings to the said States and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.   

### Article  7  

1.  The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in article 4 is found shall in the cases contemplated in article 5, if it does not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.   
2.  These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State. In the cases referred to in article 5, paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 5, paragraph I.   
3.  Any person regarding whom proceedings are brought in connection with any of the offences referred to in article 4 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings.   

### Article  8  

1.  The offences referred to in article 4 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.   
2.  If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in respect of such offences. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State.   
3.  States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize such offences as extraditable offences between themselves subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State.   
4.  Such offences shall be treated, for the purpose of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territories of the States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with article 5, paragraph 1.   

### Article  9  

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of any of the offences referred to in article 4, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings.   
2.  States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of this article in conformity with any treaties on mutual judicial assistance that may exist between them.

2.  Each State Party shall include this prohibition in the rules or instructions issued in regard to the duties and functions of any such persons.   

### Article  11  

Each State Party shall keep under systematic review interrogation rules, instructions, methods and practices as well as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with a view to preventing any cases of torture.  

### Article  12  

Each State Party shall ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.  

### Article  13  

Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.  

### Article  14  

1.  Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.   
2.  Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation which may exist under national law.   

### Article  15  

Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.  

### Article  16  

1.  Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in article 1, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture or references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

(b) wanneer de verdachte onderdaan van die Staat is;  

(c) wanneer het slachtoffer onderdaan van die Staat is, indien die Staat zulks passend acht.     
2.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, neemt tevens de eventueel noodzakelijke maatregelen tot vestiging van zijn rechtsmacht ten aanzien van zodanige delicten in de gevallen waarin de verdachte zich bevindt binnen een onder zijn rechtsmacht vallend grondgebied en deze Staat hem niet ingevolge artikel 8 uitlevert aan een van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde Staten.   
3.  Dit Verdrag sluit geen enkele strafrechtelijke rechtsmacht uit die wordt uitgeoefend overeenkomstig het nationale recht.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, binnen wiens grondgebied zich een persoon bevindt die ervan wordt verdacht een in artikel 4 bedoeld delict te hebben gepleegd, neemt deze in hechtenis of treft andere wettelijke maatregelen ten einde zijn aanwezigheid te waarborgen, nadat deze Staat zich ervan heeft overtuigd, na een onderzoek van de deze ter beschikking staande gegevens, dat de omstandigheden zulks rechtvaardigen. De hechtenis en andere wettelijke maatregelen dienen overeen te stemmen met het bepaalde in de wetgeving van die Staat, doch mogen slechts zolang worden voortgezet als nodig is om een strafvervolging of uitleveringsprocedure in te stellen.   
2.  Een zodanige Staat stelt onmiddellijk een voorlopig onderzoek naar de feiten in.   
3.  Aan ieder die zich ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel in hechtenis bevindt, dient hulp te worden geboden om zich onmiddellijk in verbinding te stellen met de dichtstbijzijnde bevoegde vertegenwoordiger van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is, of, indien hij staatloos is, met de vertegenwoordiger van de Staat waar hij gewoonlijk verblijft.   
4.  Wanneer een Staat, ingevolge dit artikel, een persoon in hechtenis heeft genomen, dient hij onmiddellijk de in artikel 5, eerste lid, bedoelde Staten in kennis te stellen van het feit dat deze persoon zich in hechtenis bevindt en van de omstandigheden die zijn gevangenhouding rechtvaardigen. De Staat die het in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde voorlopige onderzoek verricht, brengt onverwijld verslag uit van zijn bevindingen aan de genoemde Staten en deelt mede, of hij voornemens is, zijn rechtsmacht uit te oefenen.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  De Staat die Partij is, binnen het grondgebied onder wiens rechtsmacht een verdachte van het plegen van een delict zoals bedoeld in artikel 4, wordt aangetroffen, draagt in de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 5, indien hij de betrokkene niet uitlevert, de zaak voor vervolging over aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten.   
2.  Deze autoriteiten nemen hun beslissing op dezelfde wijze als in het geval van een gewoon delict van ernstige aard krachtens de wetgeving van die Staat. In de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 5, tweede lid, dienen de maatstaven voor de bewijsvoering, vereist voor vervolging en veroordeling, in geen enkel opzicht minder strikt te worden aangelegd dan die welke gelden in de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 5, eerste lid.   
3.  Aan ieder tegen wie een vervolging wordt aanhangig gemaakt in verband met een van de in artikel 4 bedoelde delicten dient in alle fasen van de procedure een billijke behandeling te worden gewaarborgd.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  De in artikel 4 bedoelde delicten worden in alle tussen Staten die Partij zijn bestaande uitleveringsverdragen geacht te zijn opgenomen als delicten waarvoor uitlevering kan worden toegestaan. De Staten die Partij zijn, verbinden zich ertoe, in alle tussen hen te sluiten uitleveringsverdragen zodanige delicten op te nemen als delicten waarvoor uitlevering kan worden toegestaan.   
2.  Indien een Staat die Partij is, uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag en een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die Partij is, waarmede hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft, kan hij dit Verdrag als juridische grondslag beschouwen voor uitlevering met betrekking tot zodanige delicten. Uitlevering is onderworpen aan bij de wetgeving van de aangezochte Staat bepaalde andere voorwaarden.   
3.  De Staten die Partij zijn en uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen tussen henzelf zodanige delicten als delicten waarvoor uitlevering kan worden toegestaan, behoudens de bij de wetgeving van de aangezochte Staat bepaalde voorwaarden.   
4.  Zodanige delicten worden, ten behoeve van uitlevering tussen Staten die Partij zijn, behandeld alsof zij niet alleen gepleegd waren op de plaats waar zij zich hebben voorgedaan, doch ook op het grondgebied van de Staten die hun rechtsmacht dienen te vestigen overeenkomstig artikel 5, eerste lid.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De Staten die Partij zijn, verlenen elkander de grootst mogelijke mate van rechtshulp in verband met vervolgingen ingesteld terzake van een van de in artikel 4 bedoelde delicten, met inbegrip van het verstrekken van alle te hunner beschikking staand bewijsmateriaal dat voor de vervolging nodig is.   
2.  De Staten die Partij zijn, kwijten zich van hun verplichtingen ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel in overeenstemming met eventueel tussen hen bestaande verdragen inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, draagt ervoor zorg dat onderricht en voorlichting betreffende het verbod van foltering volledig opgenomen worden in de opleiding van met de wetshandhaving belast burgerpersoneel en militair personeel, van medisch personeel, van overheidsfunctionarissen en van anderen die betrokken kunnen zijn bij de bewaking, ondervraging of behandeling van een persoon die enige vorm van arrestatie, hechtenis of gevangenhouding ondergaat.   
2.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, neemt dit verbod op in de voorschriften of instructies betreffende de taken en functies van zodanige personen.   

### Artikel  11  

Iedere Staat die Partij is, beziet stelselmatig de voorschriften, instructies, methoden en praktijken voor ondervraging, alsook de regelingen voor de bewaking en behandeling van personen onderworpen aan enige vorm van arrestatie, hechtenis of gevangenhouding in gebieden onder zijn rechtsmacht, met het oog op de voorkoming van gevallen van foltering.  

### Artikel  12  

Iedere Staat die Partij is, draagt ervoor zorg dat zijn bevoegde autoriteiten een onverwijld en onpartijdig onderzoek instellen, wanneer er redelijke gronden zijn om aan te nemen dat in enig gebied onder zijn rechtsmacht foltering heeft plaatsgehad.  

### Artikel  13  

Iedere Staat die Partij is, draagt ervoor zorg dat een persoon die stelt dat hij aan foltering is onderworpen in enig gebied onder de rechtsmacht van deze Staat, het recht heeft tot indiening van een klacht bij de bevoegde autoriteiten van deze Staat en er recht op heeft dat zijn zaak onverwijld en onpartijdig door die autoriteiten wordt onderzocht. Er dienen maatregelen te worden genomen ten einde te verzekeren dat de klager en eventuele getuigen beschermd worden tegen iedere vorm van kwaadwillige behandeling of intimidatie ten gevolge van diens klacht of van afgelegde getuigenverklaringen.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, waarborgt in zijn rechtsstelsel dat het slachtoffer van foltering genoegdoening krijgt en een rechtens afdwingbaar recht heeft op een billijke en toereikende schadevergoeding, met inbegrip van de middelen voor een zo volledig mogelijk herstel. Ingeval van overlijden van het slachtoffer ten gevolge van foltering hebben zijn nabestaanden aanspraak op schadevergoeding.   
2.  Niets in dit artikel doet afbreuk aan de rechten van het slachtoffer of van anderen op schadevergoeding die krachtens het nationale recht kunnen bestaan.   

### Artikel  15  

Iedere Staat die Partij is, draagt ervoor zorg dat een verklaring waarvan wordt vastgesteld dat deze is afgelegd ten gevolge van foltering, niet wordt aangevoerd als bewijs in een rechtszaak, behalve tegen een van foltering beschuldigde persoon als bewijs dat de verklaring werd afgelegd.  

### Artikel  16  

1.  Iedere Staat die Partij is, verbindt zich ertoe in alle gebieden onder zijn rechtsmacht andere vormen van wrede, onmenselijke of onterende behandeling of bestraffing, die geen foltering inhouden zoals omschreven in artikel 1, te voorkomen, wanneer zulke handelingen worden gepleegd door of op aanstichten van dan wel met instemming of gedogen van een overheidsfunctionaris of andere persoon die in een officiële hoedanigheid handelt. Inzonderheid zijn de verplichtingen vervat in de artikelen 10, 11, 12 en 13 van toepassing, met vervanging van de verwijzingen naar foltering door verwijzingen naar andere vormen van wrede, onmenselijke of onterende behandeling of bestraffing.   
2.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag laten onverlet de bepalingen van andere internationale verdragen of van nationale wetten, waarin wrede, onmenselijke of onterende behandeling of bestraffing zijn verboden, of die betrekking hebben op uitlevering of uitzetting.   

### DEEL  II  

### Artikel  17  

1.  Er wordt een Comité tegen Foltering (hierna te noemen „het Comité") ingesteld, dat de hierna te noemen functies uitoefent. Het Comité bestaat uit tien deskundigen, die hoog zedelijk aanzien genieten en erkende bekwaamheid op het gebied van de rechten van de mens bezitten, en die optreden in hun persoonlijke hoedanigheid. De deskundigen worden gekozen door Staten die Partij zijn, waarbij aandacht wordt geschonken aan een billijke geografische verdeling en waarbij dient te worden overwogen dat het lidmaatschap van enige personen die ervaring hebben op juridisch gebied raadzaam is.   
2.  De leden van het Comité worden bij geheime stemming gekozen uit een lijst van personen die zijn voorgedragen door de Staten die Partij zijn. Iedere Staat die Partij is, kan één persoon uit zijn onderdanen voordragen. De Staten die Partij zijn, dienen zich ervan bewust te zijn dat het raadzaam is personen voor te dragen die tevens lid zijn van het Comité voor de Rechten van de Mens, ingesteld krachtens het Internationaal Verdrag inzake burgerrechten en politieke rechten, en die bereid zijn zitting te nemen in het Comité tegen Foltering.   
3.  De verkiezingen van de leden van het Comité worden gehouden op door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties te beleggen tweejaarlijkse vergaderingen van de Staten die Partij zijn. Op deze vergaderingen, waarvoor twee derde van de Staten die Partij zijn, het quorum vormen, zijn degenen die in het Comité zijn gekozen die personen die het grootste aantal stemmen op zich hebben verenigd, alsmede een absolute meerderheid van de stemmen van de aanwezige vertegenwoordigers van de Staten die Partij zijn en hun stem uitbrengen.   
4.  De eerste verkiezing wordt niet later gehouden dan zes maanden na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag. Ten minste vier maanden vóór de datum van elke verkiezing richt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties een brief aan de Staten die Partij zijn, waarin hij deze uitnodigt, binnen drie maanden hun voordrachten in te zenden. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt een alfabetische lijst samen van alle aldus voorgedragen personen, onder aanduiding van de Staten die Partij zijn en die hen hebben voorgedragen, en legt deze voor aan de Staten die partij zijn.   
5.  De leden van het Comité worden gekozen voor een tijdvak van vier jaar. Zij zijn herkiesbaar indien zij opnieuw worden voorgedragen. De ambtstermijn van vijf der bij de eerste verkiezing benoemde leden loopt evenwel na twee jaar af; terstond na de eerste verkiezing worden deze vijf leden bij loting aangewezen door de voorzitter van de in het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde vergadering.   
6.  Indien een lid van het Comité overlijdt of ontslag neemt of om enige andere reden zijn taken in het Comité niet langer kan vervullen, benoemt de Staat die partij is en die hem had voorgedragen, een andere deskundige uit zijn onderdanen voor het resterende gedeelte van de ambtstermijn, zulks onder voorbehoud van de goedkeuring van de meerderheid der Staten die Partij zijn. Deze goedkeuring wordt geacht gegeven te zijn, tenzij de helft of meer van de Staten die Partij zijn, binnen zes weken nadat zij door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties van de voorgestelde benoeming in kennis zijn gesteld, afwijzend reageren.   
7.  De Staten die Partij zijn, dragen de kosten van de leden van het Comité wanneer dezen hun taak in het Comité vervullen.   

### Artikel  18  

1.  Het Comité kiest zijn functionarissen voor een ambtstermijn van twee jaar. Zij zijn herkiesbaar.   
2.  Het Comité stelt zijn eigen huishoudelijke reglement vast, waarin onder meer wordt bepaald dat: 

(a) zes leden het quorum vormen;  

(b) besluiten van het Comité worden genomen met een meerderheid van het aantal door de aanwezige leden uitgebrachte stemmen.     
3.  De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties zorgt voor het personeel en de andere voorzieningen benodigd voor een doelmatige uitoefening van de taken van het Comité krachtens dit Verdrag.   
4.  De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties belegt de eerste vergadering van het Comité. Na zijn eerste vergadering komt het Comité bijeen op de tijden voorzien in zijn huishoudelijk reglement.   
5.  De Staten die Partij zijn, dragen de kosten gemaakt in verband met het houden van de vergaderingen van de Staten die Partij zijn, en van het Comité, met inbegrip van vergoeding aan de Verenigde Naties van alle kosten, zoals de kosten van personeel en voorzieningen, die de Verenigde Naties ingevolge het derde lid van dit artikel hebben gemaakt.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  De Staten die Partij zijn, leggen, binnen één jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag voor de betrokken Staat die Partij is, door bemiddeling van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, aan het Comité rapporten voor over de maatregelen die zij hebben genomen om uitvoering te geven aan hun verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag. Daarna leggen de Staten die Partij zijn, om de vier jaar aanvullende rapporten over inzake genomen nieuwe maatregelen, alsmede de andere rapporten waarom het Comité kan verzoeken.   
2.  De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties zendt de rapporten toe aan alle Staten die Partij zijn.   
3.  Elk rapport wordt bestudeerd door het Comité, dat daarop algemeen commentaar kan leveren dat het passend acht; het zendt dit commentaar toe aan de betrokken Staat die Partij is. De Staat die Partij is, kan daarop bij het Comité reageren met zijn eigen opmerkingen.   
4.  Het Comité kan naar eigen inzicht besluiten om overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel geleverd commentaar, te zamen met de opmerkingen daarover die zijn ontvangen van de betrokken Staat die Partij is, op te nemen in zijn jaarverslag opgesteld overeenkomstig artikel 24. Indien de betrokken Staat die Partij is, zulks verzoekt, kan het Comité tevens een afschrift van het ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel overgelegde rapport daarin opnemen.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  Indien het Comité betrouwbare informatie ontvangt, die zijns inziens goed gefundeerde aanwijzingen bevat dat in het gebied van een Staat die Partij is, stelselmatig foltering wordt toegepast, verzoekt het Comité de Staat die Partij is, mede te werken bij de bestudering van deze informatie en hiertoe opmerkingen in te zenden betreffende de betrokken informatie.   
2.  Met inachtneming van eventuele opmerkingen die door de betrokken Staat die Partij is, zijn ingezonden, alsmede van alle andere van belang zijnde informatie waarover het beschikt, kan het Comité indien het besluit dat dit verantwoord is, een of meer van zijn leden aanwijzen om een vertrouwelijk onderzoek in te stellen en ten spoedigste verslag hierover uit te brengen aan het Comité.   
3.  Indien overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel een onderzoek wordt ingesteld, poogt het Comité de medewerking te verwerven van de betrokken Staat die Partij is. In overeenstemming met die Staat die Partij is, kan een zodanig onderzoek een bezoek aan zijn grondgebied omvatten.   
4.  Na bestudering van de bevindingen van zijn lid of leden, overgelegd overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, zendt het Comité deze bevindingen toe aan de betrokken Staat die Partij is, te zamen met de commentaren of voorstellen die in het licht van de situatie passend lijken.   
5.  Alle werkzaamheden van het Comité bedoeld in het eerste tot en met het vierde lid van dit artikel zijn vertrouwelijk van aard en in alle stadia van de werkzaamheden zal worden gestreefd naar de medewerking van de Staat die Partij is. Nadat deze werkzaamheden met betrekking tot een overeenkomstig het tweede lid ingesteld onderzoek zijn voltooid, kan het Comité, na overleg met de betrokken Staat die Partij is, besluiten een beknopt verslag van de resultaten van de werkzaamheden op te nemen in zijn jaarverslag opgesteld overeenkomstig artikel 24.   

### Artikel  21  

1.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, kan krachtens dit artikel te allen tijde verklaren, dat hij de bevoegdheid van het Comité erkent kennisgevingen waarin een Staat die Partij is, stelt dat een andere Staat die Partij is, diens uit dit Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen niet nakomt, in ontvangst te nemen en te behandelen. Zulke kennisgevingen kunnen alleen in ontvangst worden genomen en worden behandeld overeenkomstig de in dit artikel vervatte procedure, indien zij zijn ingezonden door een Staat die Partij is, en die een verklaring heeft afgelegd dat hij ten aanzien van zichzelf deze bevoegdheid van het Comité erkent. Een kennisgeving wordt niet krachtens dit artikel door het Comité behandeld, indien deze betrekking heeft op een Staat die Partij is en die zulk een verklaring niet heeft afgelegd. Kennisgevingen die krachtens het bepaalde in dit artikel worden ontvangen, worden overeenkomstig de volgende procedure behandeld: 

(a) Indien een Staat die Partij is, van oordeel is dat een andere Staat die Partij is, de bepalingen van dit Verdrag niet uitvoert, kan hij door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving de zaak onder de aandacht brengen van die Staat die Partij is. Binnen drie maanden na ontvangst van de kennisgeving stuurt de ontvangende Staat de Staat die de kennisgeving had gezonden een schriftelijke uiteenzetting of een andere schriftelijke verklaring, waarin de zaak wordt opgehelderd en waarin, voor zover mogelijk en ter zake doende, wordt verwezen naar procedures en rechtsmiddelen die in het land zelf reeds zijn toegepast, nog hangende zijn of die zouden kunnen worden aangewend;  

(b) Indien de zaak niet tot genoegen van de beide betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, wordt geregeld binnen zes maanden na ontvangst van de eerste kennisgeving door de ontvangende Staat, heeft elk der beide Staten het recht de zaak bij het Comité aanhangig te maken, door middel van een kennisgeving die zowel aan het Comité als aan de andere Staat wordt gezonden;  

(c) Het Comité behandelt een bij hem ingevolge dit artikel aanhangig gemaakte zaak alleen nadat het zich ervan heeft overtuigd dat alle binnenlandse rechtsmiddelen in de betrokken zaak zijn benut en uitgeput, in overeenstemming met de algemeen erkende beginselen van het internationale recht. Deze regel geldt evenwel niet indien de toepassing der rechtsmiddelen onredelijk lange tijd vergt of waarschijnlijk geen daadwerkelijke verbetering zal meebrengen voor de persoon die het slachtoffer van de schending van dit Verdrag is;  

(d) Het Comité komt in besloten zitting bijeen wanneer het kennisgevingen krachtens dit artikel gedaan aan een onderzoek onderwerpt;  

(e) Met inachtneming van het bepaalde in letter (c) stelt het Comité zijn goede diensten ter beschikking van de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, ten einde de zaak in der minne te regelen op basis van eerbiediging van de verplichtingen als neergelegd in dit Verdrag. Hiertoe kan het Comité eventueel een conciliatiecommissie ad hoc instellen;  

(f) Bij elke bij hem ingevolge dit artikel aanhangig gemaakte zaak kan het Comité tot de betrokken in letter (b) bedoelde Staten die Partij zijn, het verzoek richten, ter zake dienende inlichtingen te verstrekken;  

(g) De in letter (b) bedoelde betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, hebben het recht zich te doen vertegenwoordigen wanneer de zaak in het Comité wordt behandeld, en hun standpunt mondeling en/of schriftelijk kenbaar te maken;  

(h) Het Comité brengt twaalf maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de krachtens letter (b) gedane kennisgeving een rapport uit, als volgt: 

(i) Indien een oplossing als voorzien in letter (e) is bereikt, beperkt het Comité zijn rapport tot een korte uiteenzetting van de feiten en van de bereikte oplossing;  

(ii) indien geen oplossing als voorzien in letter (e) is bereikt, beperkt het Comité zijn rapport tot een korte uiteenzetting van de feiten; de schriftelijk kenbaar gemaakte standpunten en een op schrift gestelde samenvatting van de mondeling naar voren gebrachte standpunten van de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, worden aan het rapport gehecht.     In elk van beide gevallen wordt het rapport toegezonden aan de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn.   
2.  De bepalingen van dit artikel treden in werking wanneer vijf Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, verklaringen hebben afgelegd krachtens het eerste lid van dit artikel. Deze verklaringen worden door de Staten die Partij zijn, nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die afschriften daarvan doet toekomen aan de andere Staten die Partij zijn. Een zodanige verklaring kan te allen tijde door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving worden ingetrokken. Een zodanige intrekking heeft geen invloed op de behandeling van een zaak die het onderwerp vormt van een kennisgeving die reeds is gedaan krachtens dit artikel; geen enkele volgende kennisgeving door een Staat die Partij is, wordt in ontvangst genomen krachtens dit artikel nadat de kennisgeving van intrekking van de verklaring door de Secretaris-Generaal is ontvangen, tenzij de betrokken Staat die Partij is, een nieuwe verklaring heeft afgelegd.   

### Artikel  22  

1.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, kan krachtens dit artikel te allen tijde verklaren dat hij de bevoegdheid van het Comité erkent kennisgevingen van of namens personen die onder zijn rechtsmacht vallen en die stellen het slachtoffer te zijn van schending door een Staat die Partij is, van de bepalingen van het Verdrag, in ontvangst te nemen en te behandelen. Het Comité neemt geen kennisgeving in ontvangst indien deze betrekking heeft op een Staat die Partij is bij het Verdrag en die zulk een verklaring niet heeft afgelegd.   
2.  Het Comité beschouwt als niet ontvankelijk elke krachtens dit artikel toegezonden kennisgeving die anoniem is of welker inzending het beschouwt als misbruik van het recht zodanige kennisgevingen in te zenden of die het onverenigbaar acht met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
3.  Met inachtneming van het bepaalde in het tweede lid brengt het Comité alle hem krachtens dit artikel toegezonden kennisgevingen onder de aandacht van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag en die een verklaring krachtens het eerste lid heeft afgelegd en waaromtrent wordt gesteld dat deze enige bepaling van het Verdrag schendt. Binnen zes maanden doet de ontvangende Staat het Comité schriftelijke toelichtingen of andere schriftelijke verklaringen toekomen, waarin de zaak en de eventueel door die Staat toegepaste herstelmaatregelen worden uiteengezet.   
4.  Het Comité behandelt krachtens dit artikel ontvangen kennisgevingen in het licht van alle hem door of namens de betrokken persoon en door de betrokken Staat die Partij is, ter beschikking gestelde gegevens.   
5.  Het Comité neemt geen krachtens dit artikel door een individuele persoon ingediende kennisgeving in behandeling, dan nadat het zich ervan heeft overtuigd dat: 

(a) dezelfde zaak niet is of wordt onderzocht volgens een andere procedure van internationaal onderzoek of internationale regeling;  

(b) de betrokken persoon alle beschikbare nationale rechtsmiddelen heeft uitgeput; deze regel geldt evenwel niet indien de toepassing der rechtsmiddelen onredelijk lange tijd vergt of waarschijnlijk geen daadwerkelijk verbetering zal brengen voor de persoon die het slachtoffer van de schending van dit Verdrag is.     
6.  Het Comité komt in besloten zitting bijeen wanneer het kennisgevingen krachtens dit artikel gedaan aan een onderzoek onderwerpt.   
7.  Het Comité maakt zijn oordeel bekend aan de desbetreffende Staat die Partij is, en aan de betrokken persoon.   
8.  De bepalingen van dit artikel treden in werking wanneer vijf Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, verklaringen hebben afgelegd krachtens het eerste lid van dit artikel. Deze verklaringen worden door de Staten die Partij zijn, nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die afschriften daarvan doet toekomen aan alle andere Staten die Partij zijn. Een verklaring kan te allen tijde, door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving, worden ingetrokken. Een zodanige intrekking heeft geen invloed op de behandeling van een zaak die het onderwerp vormt van een kennisgeving die reeds is gedaan krachtens dit artikel; geen enkele volgende kennisgeving door of namens een persoon wordt krachtens dit artikel in ontvangst genomen nadat de kennisgeving van intrekking van de verklaring door de Secretaris-Generaal is ontvangen, tenzij de betrokken Staat die Partij is, een nieuwe verklaring heeft afgelegd.   

### Artikel  23  

De leden van het Comité en van de conciliatiecommissies ad hoc die kunnen worden ingesteld krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 21, eerste lid, letter (e), genieten de faciliteiten, voorrechten en immuniteiten van deskundigen die zijn uitgezonden door de Verenigde Naties, zoals die zijn vastgesteld in de desbetreffende delen van het Verdrag nopens de voorrechten en immuniteiten van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  24  

Het Comité brengt een jaarverslag van zijn werkzaamheden krachtens het Verdrag uit aan de Staten die Partij zijn, en aan de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties.  

### DEEL  III  

### Artikel  25  

1.  Dit Verdrag staat open voor ondertekening door alle Staten.   
2.  Dit Verdrag dient te worden bekrachtigd. De akten van bekrachtiging dienen te worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  26  

Dit Verdrag staat open voor toetreding door alle Staten. Toetreding geschiedt door de nederlegging van een akte van toetreding bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  27  

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking op de dertigste dag na de datum van nederlegging bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties van de twintigste akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.   
2.  Ten aanzien van iedere Staat die dit Verdrag bekrachtigt of ertoe toetreedt na de nederlegging van de twintigste akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding, treedt het Verdrag in werking op de dertigste dag na de datum van nederlegging van zijn eigen akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.   

### Artikel  28  

1.  Iedere Staat kan, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of van bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag of van toetreding ertoe, verklaren dat hij de in artikel 20 geregelde bevoegdheid van het Comité niet erkent.   
2.  Iedere Staat die Partij is en die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel, kan dit voorbehoud te allen tijde intrekken door middel van een kennisgeving aan de SecretarisGeneraal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  29  

1.  Iedere Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, kan een wijziging daarvan voorstellen en deze indienen bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt vervolgens de voorgestelde wijziging aan de Staten die Partij zijn, mede, met het verzoek hem te berichten of zij een conferentie van Staten die Partij zijn, verlangen ten einde het voorstel te bestuderen en in stemming te brengen. Indien, binnen vier maanden na de datum van deze mededeling, ten minste een derde van de Staten die Partij zijn, zulk een conferentie verlangt, roept de Secretaris-Generaal deze conferentie onder auspiciën van de Verenigde Naties bijeen. Iedere wijziging die door een meerderheid van de ter conferentie aanwezige Staten die partij zijn en die hun stem uitbrengen, wordt aangenomen, wordt door de Secretaris-Generaal ter aanvaarding voorgelegd aan alle Staten die Partij zijn.   
2.  Een overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel aangenomen wijziging wordt van kracht wanneer twee derde van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties ervan in kennis hebben gesteld dat zij deze hebben aanvaard overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden constitutionele procedures.   
3.  Wanneer wijzigingen van kracht worden, zijn zij bindend voor de Staten die Partij zijn en die deze hebben aanvaard, terwijl de andere Staten die Partij zijn, gebonden zullen blijven door bepalingen van dit Verdrag en door iedere voorgaande wijziging die zij hebben aanvaard.   

### Artikel  30  

1.  Geschillen tussen twee of meer Staten die Partij zijn, betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag, die niet door onderhandelingen kunnen worden geregeld, worden op verzoek van één van hen onderworpen aan arbitrage. Indien binnen zes maanden na de datum van het verzoek om arbitrage de Partijen geen overeenstemming hebben kunnen bereiken over de arbitrageregeling, kan elk der Partijen het geschil voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof door middel van een verzoek in overeenstemming met het Statuut van het Hof.   
2.  Iedere Staat kan, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag of van toetreding daartoe, verklaren dat hij zich niet gebonden acht door het eerste lid van dit artikel. De andere Staten die Partij zijn, zijn met betrekking tot een Staat die Partij is en die zulk een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt, niet gebonden door het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  Een Staat die Partij is en die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, kan dit voorbehoud te allen tijde intrekken door middel van een kennisgeving aan de SecretarisGeneraal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  31  

1.  Een Staat die Partij is, kan dit Verdrag opzeggen door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties. De opzegging wordt van kracht één jaar na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal.   
2.  Een zodanige opzegging leidt er niet toe dat de Staat die Partij is, wordt ontslagen van zijn verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag ten aanzien van enig handelen of nalaten dat zich heeft voorgedaan vóór de datum waarop de opzegging van kracht wordt en evenmin is de opzegging op enigerlei wijze van invloed op de voortzetting van de behandeling van een zaak die reeds bij het Comité in behandeling is vóór de datum waarop de opzegging van kracht wordt.   
3.  Na de datum waarop de opzegging van een Staat die Partij is, van kracht wordt, neemt het Comité geen nieuwe zaak betreffende die Staat in behandeling.
