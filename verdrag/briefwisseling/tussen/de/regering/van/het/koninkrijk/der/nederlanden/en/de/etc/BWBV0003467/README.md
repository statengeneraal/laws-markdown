### Nr.  I  

###THE HAGUE

Your Excellency, I have the honour to refer to consultations between representatives of our Governments relating to the establishment of security arrangements to permit and regulate the exchange of information between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The establishment of these arrangements has become desirable in view of the cooperation between the Netherlands and Australia as regards the production and procurement of military equipment. I am now instructed to communicate to Your Excellency that the Australian Government is prepared to conclude an arrangement to be called “The Netherlands-Australia Defence Security Arrangement”, with respect to this matter in the following terms. 
### *Mutual Security Protection*

The material to which this Arrangement relates is classified material of either or both countries relating to or in the nature of government-approved arrangements connected with Defence, including contracts, sub-contracts and pre-contract negotiations placed or entered into by or on behalf of the Netherlands Government or by or on behalf of the Australian Government.  

2. Each Government will take all appropriate measures in accordance with this Arrangement and the Schedules thereto to protect material to which this Arrangement relates that is within its territorial jurisdiction or while possessed by or furnished to persons authorised by it to take that material abroad.  

3. Matter subject to this Arrangement will be given security protection at least equal to that given each Government own classified matter of a corresponding level of security classification.  

4. Each Government will observe any further requirements for security protection which may be considered necessary by the two Governments for the purpose of regulating the exchange of classified military information between them.  

5. Each Government will withhold matter subject to this Arrangement from the Government, firms, or citizens of a third State unless written approval to do otherwise is first obtained from the Government furnishing the matter.  

6. Matter subject to this Arrangement will not be used for purposes other than defence purposes.  

7. Each Government will arrange for necessary security inspections to be made of any facility within its territorial jurisdiction to which or through which matter subject to this Arrangement may be passed, or which may in any way be connected with the use or transmission of that matter.  

8. Each Government, upon request, will provide reasonable facility for periodic visits by representatives of the requesting Government to review together the security provisions presently in force with a view to achieving mutual understanding of the adequacy and reasonable compatibility of the respective security systems.  

9. Where a contract or arrangement involving classified matter is negotiated by or through the Government of the country furnishing the matter and is to be performed within the other country, the Government furnishing the matter will in each case incorporate in the contract document a security requirements clause as required by Schedule B to this letter, in the case of the Netherlands Government, or Schedule C to this letter in the case of the Australian Government, or in either case an appropriate equivalent clause.  

10. Transmission of matter subject to this Arrangement will be made only through Government-to-Government channels and by representatives designated by each of the Governments.  

11. Matter subject to this Arrangement will be made available only to a person who requires it in the performance of his duties and who has been appropriately security cleared and authorised to have the information.  

12. Visits which involve access to or the exchange or passage of classified matter must have the prior approval of both Governments. Approval for such visits will be granted only to persons possessing valid clearances.   
### *Terminology* 

13. In this Arrangement, the term “classified matter” includes all matter, in whatever form transmitted from one Government to the other, that is marked with a security classification or is indicated to be so classified by or under the direction of the transmitting Government.   
### *Protection of Private Rights* 

14. Each Government will respect all industrial ownership rights, including copyrights and rights originating from inventions, which are involved in information exchanged under this Arrangement.   
### *Security Costs* 

15. No compensation will be paid between Governments for costs arising in connection with the carrying out of security measures.

22. This Arrangement will only apply to the part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands situated in Europe.   If the foregoing is acceptable to the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, I propose that this letter and Your Excellency's confirmatory reply constitute the Arrangement which will come into effect on the date on which the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands informs the Government of Australia in writing that the procedures constitutionally required in the Kingdom of the Netherlands have been complied with.

Excellentie, Ik heb de eer te verwijzen naar het overleg dat heeft plaatsgevonden tussen vertegenwoordigers van onze Regeringen met betrekking tot het totstandbrengen van beveiligingsregelingen ten einde de uitwisseling van gegevens mogelijk te maken en te regelen tussen de Regering van Australië en de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden. Het totstandkomen van deze regelingen is wenselijk geworden in verband met de samenwerking tussen Nederland en Australië op het gebied van de produktie en de aanschaf van militaire uitrusting. Ik kan Uwe Excellentie thans mededelen dat de Australische Regering bereid is ter zake een overeenkomst te sluiten, te noemen „Nederlands-Australische Overeenkomst inzake een defensiebeveiligingsregeling”, waarbij het volgende wordt geregeld. 
### *Wederzijdse beveiliging* 

1. De gegevens waarop deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft, zijn geclassificeerde gegevens van een van beide landen of van beide landen, die verband houden met of vallen onder van regeringswege goedgekeurde regelingen inzake defensie-aangelegenheden, daarbij inbegrepen contracten, subcontracten of aan de totstandkoming daarvan voorafgaande onderhandelingen, geplaatst, respectievelijk aangegaan door of namens de Nederlandse Regering of door of namens de Australische Regering.  

2. Iedere Regering neemt in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende bijlagen alle passende maatregelen ter bescherming van de gegevens waarop deze Overeenkomst betrekking heeft en die zich bevinden op haar territoriaal rechtsgebied dan wel in het bezit zijn van of worden verstrekt aan personen die door haar zijn gemachtigd deze gegevens mee naar het buitenland te nemen.  

3. De gegevens die onder deze Overeenkomst vallen, krijgen een beveiliging, die ten minste gelijk is aan de beveiliging gegeven aan de eigen geclassificeerde gegevens van iedere Regering die een overeenkomstige beveiligingsclassificatie bezitten.  

4. Iedere Regering neemt alle verdere beveiligingsvoorschriften in acht die door beide Regeringen als noodzakelijk kunnen worden beschouwd voor het regelen van de onderlinge uitwisseling van geclassificeerde militaire informatie.  

5. Geen van beide Regeringen verleent inzage van de gegevens die onder deze Overeenkomst vallen, aan de Regering, ondernemingen en burgers van een derde Staat, tenzij eerst van de Regering die deze gegevens heeft verstrekt, schriftelijk toestemming is verkregen om anders te handelen.  

6. De onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens worden niet gebruikt voor andere dan defensiedoeleinden.  

7. Iedere Regering zorgt voor de noodzakelijke beveiligingsinspecties waaraan dient te worden onderworpen ieder object op haar territoriale rechtsgebied waaraan of waardoor onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens kunnen worden doorgegeven of dat op enigerlei wijze zou kunnen zijn betrokken bij het gebruik of het doorgeven van deze gegevens.  

8. Iedere Regering verstrekt op verzoek redelijke faciliteiten voor periodieke bezoeken door vertegenwoordigers van de verzoekende Regering ten einde te zamen de alsdan van kracht zijnde beveiligingsbepalingen te bezien met het doel te komen tot een wederzijds inzicht in de toereikendheid en de redelijke verenigbaarheid van de onderscheiden beveiligingssystemen.  

9. Indien over een contract of regeling inzake geclassificeerde gegevens wordt onderhandeld door of namens de Regering van het land dat de gegevens verstrekt, en dit contract of deze regeling ten uitvoer moet worden gelegd in het andere land, zal de Regering die de gegevens verstrekt, in dat contract een beveiligingsclausule opnemen zoals vereist in Bijlage B bij deze brief wanneer het de Nederlandse Regering betreft, of in Bijlage C bij deze brief wanneer het de Australische Regering betreft, of in elk van beide gevallen een passende gelijkwaardige clausule.  

10. Het doorgeven van onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens geschiedt alleen langs tussen de Regeringen bestaande kanalen en door vertegenwoordigers die door iedere Regering zijn aangewezen.  

11. De onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens worden alleen ter beschikking gesteld van personen die deze gegevens nodig hebben bij de uitoefening van hun taken en die ten aanzien van de beveiliging een passende clearance hebben verkregen alsmede de machtiging om de informatie in hun bezit te hebben.  

12. Bezoeken die de toegang tot of de uitwisseling of overdracht van geclassificeerde gegevens met zich brengen, dienen vooraf te worden goedgekeurd door beide Regeringen. Voor deze bezoeken wordt goedkeuring alleen verleend aan personen die in het bezit zijn van geldige clearances.   
### *Terminologie* 

13. In deze Overeenkomst omvat de term „geclassificeerde gegevens” alle gegevens, in welke vorm dan ook, die van de ene Regering aan de andere Regering worden toegezonden en waarop een beveiligingsclassificatie is aangebracht dan wel waarop is aangegeven dat zij aldus dienen te worden geclassificeerd door of onder leiding van de Regering die deze gegevens toezendt.   
### *Bescherming van particuliere rechten* 

14. Iedere Regering eerbiedigt de industriële eigendomsrechten met inbegrip van auteursrechten en rechten die voortvloeien uit uitvindingen, voor zover deze rechten in het geding zijn bij de krachtens deze Overeenkomst uitgewisselde informatie.   
### *Beveiligingskosten* 

15. De Regeringen betalen elkaar geen vergoeding voor de kosten die verband houden met de uitvoering van beveiligingsmaatregelen.   
### *Schending van de beveiligingsbepalingen* 

16. In geval van schending van voorschriften of bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens, wordt door de bevoegde autoriteiten en door de bevoegde rechtbanken een onderzoek en rechtsvervolging ingesteld.  

17. In geval van verlies, compromittering of mogelijke compromittering van geclassificeerde gegevens of enige schending van voorschriften inzake de beveiliging van onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens, wordt hiervan onverwijld melding gemaakt aan de Regering die de gegevens heeft verstrekt.   
### *Bijlagen* 

18. Nadere bijzonderheden omtrent de te volgen werkwijze bij de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst worden uiteengezet in de Bijlagen A, B, C en D bij deze brief.

19. Deze Overeenkomst wordt herzien op verzoek van een van beide Regeringen.  

20. Deze Overeenkomst houdt op van kracht te zijn zes maanden na ontvangst van een door de ene Regering aan de andere Regering toegezonden schriftelijke kennisgeving van beëindiging.  

21. Tenzij door beide Regeringen anders is overeengekomen worden alle onder deze Overeenkomst vallende gegevens, bij beëindiging van de Overeenkomst, behandeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst.  

22. Deze Overeenkomst is alleen van toepassing op het in Europa gelegen deel van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden.   Indien het bovenstaande aanvaardbaar is voor de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, stel ik voor dat deze brief en Uwer Excellenties bevestigend antwoord de Overeenkomst vormen die in werking zal treden op de datum waarop de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden de Regering van Australië schriftelijk ervan in kennis stelt dat is voldaan aan de in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden constitutioneel vereiste procedures. Ik maak van deze gelegenheid gebruik Uwe Excellentie opnieuw te verzekeren van mijn zeer bijzondere hoogachting. (w.g.)

### Bijlage  B  

1.  *Beveiligingsclausule*  

(a) De bepalingen van deze clausule zijn gebaseerd op de Nederlands-Australische Overeenkomst inzake een Defensiebeveiligingsregeling, en zijn van toepassing voor zover dit contract met zich brengt de toegang tot en het hanteren van informatie waaraan door de Nederlandse Regering een beveiligingsclassificatie is toegekend.  

(b) De Nederlandse Regering kent een beveiligingsclassificatie toe aan ieder element van de geclassificeerde informatie die in het kader van dit contract wordt verstrekt of dient te worden ontwikkeld, en stelt de „Chief Security Adviser” van het „Central Office of Industrial Security” van het Ministerie van Defensie op de hoogte van deze beveiligingsclassificatie. Indien geclassificeerde informatie mondeling openbaar wordt gemaakt naar aanleiding van een bezoek dat door of namens de Nederlandse Regering wordt gebracht aan de contractant, wordt de contractant op de hoogte gesteld van deze beveiligingsclassificatie. De „Chief Security Adviser” van het „Central Office of Industrial Security" van het Ministerie van Defensie kent een gelijkwaardige Australische beveiligingsclassificatie toe aan ieder element van de geclassificeerde informatie die in het kader van het contract wordt verstrekt of dient te worden ontwikkeld, en zendt de informatie aan de contractant. De Nederlandse Regering houdt alle beveiligingsclassificaties bij en stelt de „Chief Security Adviser” van het „Central Office of Industrial Security” van het Ministerie van Defensie op de hoogte van iedere hierop aangebrachte wijziging en wel door middel van richtlijnen voor beveiligingsclassificatie. Ieder geclassificeerd element van dit contract wordt door de contractant beveiligd als Australische geclassificeerde informatie en valt onder de bepalingen van de Australische wetten en voorschriften.  

(c) De contractant zal bij de uitvoering van dit contract geen andere Nederlandse geclassificeerde informatie verwerken, openbaren of vrijgeven dan die welke hem is verstrekt in verband met dit contract, zonder de uitdrukkelijke schriftelijke toestemming van de Directeur van de aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst.  

(d) Voor zover aan elementen van dit contract een beveiligingsclassificatie is toegekend of kan worden toegekend, zoals hierboven onder letter (b) is bedoeld, beveiligt de contractant alle geclassificeerde elementen van dit contract en draagt hij zorg voor een systeem van beveiligingscontroles binnen zijn eigen organisatie in overeenstemming met de vereisten van: 

(1) de „Beveiligingsovereenkomst-Beveiligingsdocument” No. 4 (bijgevoegd) en de bepalingen van „Beveiligingsdocument” No. 1 of No. 2 al naar gelang van toepassing (zie Bijlage A) tussen de contractant en het Ministerie van Defensie, en van enige wijziging op de Beveiligingsovereenkomst of Beveiligingsdocument No. 1 of 2, al naar gelang van toepassing voor het aanpassen van deze voorschriften aan de werkzaamheden van de contractant;  

(2) Elke wijziging op bedoelde voorschriften, tot stand gekomen na de datum van dit contract, waarvan de contractant in kennis is gesteld door de Australische Regering („Central Office of Industrial Security”, Ministerie van Defensie) die op het gebied van de beveiliging bevoegdheid bezit met betrekking tot de objecten.    

(e) Vertegenwoordigers van het Ministerie van Defensie, het „Central Office of Industral Security” die op het gebied van de beveiliging bevoegdheid bezitten met betrekking tot de objecten, zijn gemachtigd om met redelijke tussenpozen een onderzoek in te stellen naar de procedures, methoden en objecten die door de contractant worden gebruikt bij het nakomen van de beveiligingsvoorschriften in het kader van dit contract op plaatsen in Australië. Mocht de Australische Regering vaststellen dat de contractant niet voldoet aan de beveiligingsvoorschriften van dit contract, dan wordt de contractant door het „Central Office of Industrial Security” van het Ministerie van Defensie schriftelijk op de hoogte gesteld van de passende maatregelen die moeten worden genomen opdat hij alsnog zal voldoen aan deze voorschriften.  

(f) Indien na de datum van dit contract de beveiligingsclassificaties of de beveiligingsvoorschriften in het kader van dit contract worden gewijzigd door de Nederlandse Regering of door de Australische Regering, en de in het kader van dit contract te maken beveiligingskosten daardoor hoger of lager worden, wordt, in verband met deze hogere of lagere kosten, de contractprijs op billijke wijze aangepast.  

(g) De contractant stemt in met het opnemen van bepalingen in alle subcontracten die worden gegund aan Australische contractanten en die toegang tot geclassificeerde informatie met zich brengen, welke bepalingen inhoudelijk overeenkomen met de tekst van deze clausule, met inbegrip van dit lid. Voor subcontracten die worden gegund aan andere dan Australische contractanten, wordt een passende beveiligingsclausule verkregen van de Nederlandse Regering en deze wordt opgenomen in het subcontract.  

(h) De contractant stemt er tevens mee in dat hij nagaat of iedere subcontractant die hij voorstelt voor de levering van materiaal en diensten die toegang tot bij de contractant berustende geclassificeerde informatie met zich brengt, alvorens hem toegang wordt verleend tot de geclassificeerde informatie: 

(1) indien de subcontractant is gevestigd in Australië, een passende en nog geldige beveiligingsclearance van het „Central Office of Industrial Security” van het Ministerie van Defensie heeft gekregen, en beschikt over de mogelijkheid om geclassificeerde informatie op passende wijze op te bergen;  

(2) indien de subcontractant is gevestigd in een ander land, door de Nederlandse Regering is goedgekeurd om toegang te hebben tot Nederlandse geclassificeerde informatie.    

(i) Een passende clausule wordt opgenomen in het contract indien de instantie die het contract aangaat, de procedure voor het aangaan van subcontracten wenst te beperken.

(a) De bepalingen van deze clausule zijn gebaseerd op de Nederlands-Australische Overeenkomst inzake een Defensiebeveiligingsregeling, en zijn van toepassing voor zover dit contract met zich brengt de toegang tot en het hanteren van informatie waaraan door de Australische Regering een beveiligingsclassificatie is toegekend.  

(b) De Australische Regering kent een beveiligingsclassificatie toe aan ieder element van de geclassificeerde informatie die in het kader van dit contract wordt verstrekt of zal worden ontwikkeld, en stelt de Directeur van de aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst op de hoogte van deze beveiligingsclassificatie. Indien geclassificeerde informatie mondeling openbaar wordt gemaakt naar aanleiding van een bezoek dat door of namens de Australische Regering wordt gebracht aan de contractant, wordt de contractant op de hoogte gesteld van deze beveiligingsclassificatie. De aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst kent een gelijkwaardige Nederlandse beveiligingsclassificatie toe aan ieder element van de geclassificeerde informatie die in het kader van het contract wordt verstrekt of zal worden ontwikkeld, en zendt de informatie aan de contractant. De Australische Regering houdt alle beveiligingsclassificaties bij en stelt de aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst op de hoogte van iedere hierop aangebrachte wijziging. Ieder geclassificeerd element van dit contract wordt door de contractant beveiligd als Nederlandse geclassificeerde informatie en valt onder de bepalingen van de Nederlandse wetten en voorschriften.  

(c) De contractant zal bij de uitvoering van dit contract geen andere Australische geclassificeerde informatie verwerken, openharen of vrijgeven dan welke hem is verstrekt in verband met dit contract, zonder de uitdrukkelijke schriftelijke toestemming van de Australische Regering.  

(d) Voor zover aan elementen van dit contract een beveiligingsclassificatie is toegekend of kan worden toegekend, zoals hierboven onder letter (b) is bedoeld, beveiligt de contractant alle geclassificeerde elementen van dit contract en draagt hij zorg voor een systeem van beveiligingscontroles binnen zijn eigen organisatie in overeenstemming met de vereisten van: 

(1) het Algemeen Beveiligingsvoorschrift voor Defensieopdrachten 1965 voor de betrekkingen tussen de contractant en de Minister van Defensie, en van elke wijziging op het Algemeen Beveiligingsvoorschrift voor het aanpassen van deze voorschriften aan de werkzaamheden van de contractant;  

(2) elke wijziging op bedoelde voorschriften, tot stand gekomen na de datum van dit contract, waarvan de contractant in kennis is gesteld door de aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst die op het gebied van de beveiliging bevoegdheid bezit met betrekking tot de objecten.    

(e) Vertegenwoordigers van de aangewezen Nederlandse Inlichtingendienst die op het gebied van de beveiliging bevoegdheid bezitten met betrekking tot de objecten, zijn gemachtigd om met redelijke tussenpozen een onderzoek in te stellen naar de procedures, methoden en objecten die door de contractant worden gebruikt bij het nakomen van de beveiligingsvoorschriften in het kader van dit contract op plaatsen in Nederland. Mocht de Nederlandse Regering vaststellen dat de contractant niet voldoet aan de beveiligingsvoorschriften van dit contract, dan wordt de contractant door het Nederlandse Ministerie van Defensie schriftelijk op de hoogte gesteld van de passende maatregelen die moeten worden genomen opdat hij alsnog zal voldoen aan deze voorschriften.  

(f) Indien na de datum van dit contract de beveiligingsclassificaties of de beveiligingsvoorschriften in het kader van dit contract worden gewijzigd door de Nederlandse Regering of door de Australische Regering, en de in het kader van dit contract te maken beveiligingskosten daardoor hoger of lager worden, wordt, in verband met deze hogere of lagere kosten, de contractprijs op billijke wijze aangepast.  

(g) De contractant stemt in met het opnemen van bepalingen in alle subcontracten die worden gegund aan Nederlandse contractanten en die toegang tot geclassificeerde informatie met zich brengen, welke bepalingen inhoudelijk overeenkomen met de tekst van deze clausule, met inbegrip van het lid. Voor subcontracten die worden gegund aan andere dan Nederlandse contractanten, wordt een passende beveiligingsclausule verkregen van de Australische Regering en deze wordt opgenomen in het subcontract.  

(h) De contractant stemt er tevens mee in dat hij nagaat of iedere subcontractant die hij voorstelt voor de levering van materiaal en diensten die toegang tot bij de contractant berustende geclassificeerde informatie met zich brengt, alvorens hem toegang wordt verleend tot de geclassificeerde informatie: 

(1) indien de subcontractant is gevestigd in Nederland, een passende en nog geldige beveiligingsclearance voor het desbetreffende object van het Nederlandse Ministerie van Defensie heeft gekregen en beschikt over de mogelijkheid om geclassificeerde informatie op passende wijze op te bergen;  

(2) indien de subcontractant is gevestigd in een ander land, door de Australische Regering is goedgekeurd om toegang te hebben tot Australische geclassificeerde informatie.    

(i) Een passende clausule wordt opgenomen in het contract inen de instantie die het contract aangaat, de procedure voor het aangaan van subcontracten wenst te beperken.
