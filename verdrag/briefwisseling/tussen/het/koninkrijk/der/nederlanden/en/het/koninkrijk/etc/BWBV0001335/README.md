##Briefwisseling tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en het Koninkrijk Denemarken inzake een verdrag houdende bepalingen inzake de status van de brigadestaf van de „United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade" (Shirbrig) in Denemarken

### Nr.  I  

Copenhagen, 5 March 1998 Annex (Provisions on the Status of the Planning Element in Denmark)  Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the Operation, Funding, Administration and Status of the Planning Element of the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade, initially signed by Denmark on 14th of March 1997, according to which the status of the Planning Element and its personnel from nations other than the Host Nation will be dealt with in separate arrangements (section 6.1). The Government of Denmark has offered to provide facilities in Denmark for the Planning Element. Following discussions of the International Implementation Group of the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade I have the honour to propose that the status, immunities and procedures applicable to the Planning Element and its personnel will be as set out in this Note and the enclosed annex to this Note (Provisions on the Status of the Planning Element in Denmark) which represents the conclusions of the Group. It is the aim for the Planning Element to commence its functions as of 3rd of June 1997. If this proposal, which has been approved by the said Implementation Group, is acceptable to the Government of the Netherlands, this Note and Your Excellency's reply to that effect will constitute an agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark that will enter into force on the first day of the second month after the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark have informed each other that the constitutional procedures therefor have been complied with. It is the understanding that the agreement represents an interim arrangement which, subject to negotiations between the participants in the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade and subject to constitutional requirements, is intended to be replaced by a multilateral and reciprocal agreement on the status of forces, including the status of the officials of the Planning Element of the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade. Such an agreement could be inspired by existing international instruments defining the status of forces, e.g. the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the status of their forces and the Agreement among the States Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and the other States participating in the Partnership for Peace regarding the Status of their Forces and the Additional Protocol to that Agreement. Consultations with respect to amendments to the said Provisions will be entered into at the request of either Government. Such amendments will be made by mutual consent and in writing. Either Government may denounce this agreement by means of a notification in writing. The denunciation will take effect 1 year after the receipt of the denunciation. The Government of Denmark will inform the Steering Committee of the denunciation. Any dispute between the two Governments concerning the interpretation or application of the said Provisions which is not settled by negotiation, will be referred for final decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one to be chosen by each Government and one to be chosen by the Steering Committee for the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade. The tribunal will appoint one of its members as chairman. This agreement shall be provisionally applied from the day after Your Excellency's reply. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.  (sd.) NIELS HELVEG PETERSEN Niels Helveg Petersen   *His Excellency*   *Mr. Johannes Hubertus Wilhelmus Fietelaars*   *Ambassador Extraordinary and*   *Plenipotentiary of The Netherlands*   *Copenhagen*

### Nr.  II  

Copenhagen, 11 May 1998  Excellency, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's Note of 5 March 1998, with annex, which reads as follows:  (Zoals in Nr. I)  I have the honour to inform Your Excellency, on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands accepts the above proposal of the Government of Denmark and to confirm that Your Excellency's Note and this reply shall be regarded as constituting an agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter which shall be provisionally applied from the day after the receipt of this reply and which shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after both States have informed each other that the constitutional procedures therefor have been complied with. I would appreciate it if Your Excellency could confirm receipt of this reply. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.  Yours sincerely, (sd.) P. J. HANSEN  Peter J. Hansen Chargé d'Affaires a.i.  *His Excellency*   *Mr. Niels Helveg Petersen*   *Minister for Foreign Affairs*   *Asiatisk Plads 2*   *1448 Copenhagen K*    

### Nr.  I  

Kopenhagen, 5 maart 1998 Bijlage (Bepalingen inzake de rechtspositie van de kernbrigade-staf in Denemarken)  Excellentie, Ik heb de eer te verwijzen naar het Memorandum van Overeenstemming inzake de werking, de financiering, het beheer en de rechtspositie van de kernbrigadestaf van de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade, dat in eerste instantie door Denemarken is ondertekend op 14 maart 1997, en waarin is bepaald dat de rechtspositie van de kernbrigadestaf en van het personeel van deze staf uit andere landen dan het gastheerland, wordt vastgelegd in afzonderlijke regelingen (hoofdstuk 6.1). De Regering van Denemarken heeft aangeboden voorzieningen in Denemarken beschikbaar te stellen ten behoeve van de kernbrigadestaf. Naar aanleiding van discussies binnen de internationale Implementatiegroep van de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade heb ik de eer u te mogen voorstellen dat de rechtspositie, immuniteiten en procedures die van toepassing zijn op de kernbrigadestaf en op het personeel hiervan, luiden zoals vermeld in deze brief en in de bijlage bij deze brief (Bepalingen inzake de rechtspositie van de kernbrigadestaf in Denemarken), die de conclusies van de Implementatiegroep weergeeft. Het is de bedoeling dat de kernbrigadestaf op 3 juni 1997 met zijn werkzaamheden begint. Indien dit voorstel, dat door genoemde Implementatiegroep is goedgekeurd, aanvaardbaar is voor de Nederlandse Regering, vormen deze brief en Uwer Excellenties antwoord daarop een verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en het Koninkrijk Denemarken, dat in werking treedt op de eerste dag van de tweede maand nadat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en het Koninkrijk Denemarken elkaar ervan op de hoogte hebben gebracht dat aan de daarvoor constitutioneel vereiste procedures is voldaan. Dit Verdrag houdt een tijdelijke regeling in waarvan de bedoeling is dat deze, afhankelijk van onderhandelingen tussen de deelnemers aan de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade en afhankelijk van constitutionele vereisten, wordt vervangen door een multilateraal en wederzijds verdrag inzake de rechtspositie van de strijdkrachten, met inbegrip van de rechtspositie van de functionarissen van de kernbrigadestaf van de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade. Dit Verdrag zou gebaseerd kunnen zijn op bestaande internationale akten waarin de rechtspositie van strijdkrachten is vastgelegd, bijvoorbeeld het Verdrag tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bij het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag, nopens de rechtspositie van hun krijgsmachten en het Verdrag tussen Staten die Partij zijn bij het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag en de overige Staten die deelnemen aan het Partnerschap voor de Vrede, nopens de rechtspositie van hun krijgsmachten en het Aanvullend Protocol daarbij. Overleg betreffende wijzigingen van de genoemde Bepalingen vindt plaats op verzoek van een van beide Regeringen. Deze wijzigingen geschieden schriftelijk en met wederzijdse instemming. Elk der Regeringen kan dit Verdrag opzeggen door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving. De opzegging wordt van kracht een jaar na de ontvangst van de kennisgeving van opzegging. De Regering van Denemarken stelt de Stuurgroep in kennis van de opzegging. Geschillen tussen de twee Regeringen inzake de interpretatie of de toepassing van de genoemde Bepalingen die niet door middel van onderhandelingen kunnen worden beslecht, worden ter finale beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht met drie scheidsrechters, waarvan een wordt gekozen door elke Regering en een door de Stuurgroep voor de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade. Het scheidsgerecht benoemt een van zijn leden tot voorzitter. Dit verdrag wordt voorlopig toegepast vanaf de dag nadat Uwe Excellenties antwoord is ontvangen. Gaarne maak ik van deze gelegenheid gebruik om Uwe Excellentie de hernieuwde verzekering van mijn zeer bijzondere hoogachting aan te bieden.  (w.g.) NIELS HELVEG PETERSEN Niels Helveg Petersen   *Aan Zijne Excellentie*   *Johannes Hubertus Wilhelmus Fietelaars*   *Buitengewoon en gevolmachtigd Ambassadeur van Nederland*   *te Kopenhagen*

### Artikel  5  

####Rechtspositie van het terrein en de gebouwen

1.  Tenzij in deze Bepalingen anders wordt bepaald, is de Deense wet van toepassing op het terrein en de gebouwen van de kernbrigadestaf.   
2.  Tenzij in deze Bepalingen anders wordt bepaald, hebben de Deense rechtbanken of andere toepasselijke Deense instanties op grond van de toepasselijke wetten rechtsbevoegdheid over handelingen, transacties of nalatingen die zich voordoen op of in het terrein en de gebouwen van de kernbrigadestaf.   
3.  Het archief en andere officiële stukken van de kernbrigadestaf zijn, ongeacht waar deze zich bevinden, onschendbaar, tenzij de stafchef afstand heeft gedaan van deze immuniteit.   
4.  Rechtshandelingen, met inbegrip van de betekening van juridische stukken en de inbeslagneming van eigendommen, vinden niet plaats binnen het terrein en de gebouwen van de kernbrigadestaf, behoudens met de instemming van, en onder de voorwaarden die zijn goedgekeurd door de Stuurgroep voor de Multinationale United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade.   
5.  De Deense voorschriften inzake de voorkoming en bestrijding van besmettelijke ziekten bij mensen, dieren en planten en inzake de voorkoming en bestrijding van plantenziekten, zijn van toepassing op de kernbrigadestaf; de kernbrigadestaf en de Deense autoriteiten houden elkaar op de hoogte van het uitbreken, of het vermeende uitbreken, de ontwikkeling en de uitbanning van besmettelijke ziekten, en van de genomen maatregelen.   
6.  

a) Officiële motorvoertuigen en aanhangers die aan de kernbrigadestaf toebehoren, zijn voorzien van een duidelijk herkenbaar, door de Deense autoriteiten afgegeven kenteken, dat aangeeft dat zij tot een militaire inrichting behoren. Afwijkingen van de voorschriften inzake gedragingen in het wegverkeer zijn de kernbrigadestaf toegestaan onder dezelfde voorwaarden en in dezelfde mate als dit de Deense strijdkrachten is toegestaan.  

b) Ten aanzien van de officiële motorvoertuigen en aanhangers, gelden voor de kernbrigadestaf niet de Deense voorschriften inzake de verplichte verzekering van houders van motorvoertuigen.     
7.  Onverminderd het in deze Bepalingen gestelde, neemt de kernbrigadestaf alle doenlijke maatregelen om te voorkomen dat het terrein en de gebouwen worden gebruikt als toevluchtsoord voor personen die hun arrestatie op grond van de Deense wetgeving trachten te ontlopen, die door de Regering worden opgeëist voor uitlevering aan een ander land, of die trachten de betekening van juridische documenten te ontlopen.
