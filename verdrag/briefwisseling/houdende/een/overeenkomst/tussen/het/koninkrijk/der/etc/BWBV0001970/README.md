Ik heb de eer voor te stellen dat, indien het bovenstaande voor uw Regering aanvaardbaar is, deze brief en uw bevestiging tezamen een Overeenkomst vormen tussen de Tsjechische Republiek en het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, ten behoeve van de Nederlandse Antillen.

### Aanhangsel  

####Overeenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, ten behoeve van de Nederlandse Antillen, en de Tsjechische Republiek betreffende automatische gegevensuitwisseling inzake inkomsten uit spaargelden in de vorm van rentebetaling

Overwegende hetgeen volgt: 

1. Artikel 17, tweede lid, van Richtlijn 2003/48/EG (hierna genoemd „de richtlijn”) van de Raad van de Europese Unie (hierna genoemd „de Raad”) betreffende belastingheffing op inkomsten uit spaargelden in de vorm van rentebetaling bepaalt dat de lidstaten de wettelijke en bestuursrechtelijke bepalingen vaststellen en bekendmaken die nodig zijn om vanaf 1 januari 2005 te voldoen aan deze richtlijn, mits: 

– de Zwitserse Bondsstaat, het Vorstendom Liechtenstein, de Republiek San Marino, het Vorstendom Monaco en het Vorstendom Andorra vanaf diezelfde datum maatregelen toepassen die gelijkwaardig zijn aan de maatregelen waarin de richtlijn voorziet, zulks overeenkomstig de overeenkomsten die zij met de Europese Gemeenschap hebben gesloten, na met eenparigheid van stemmen genomen besluiten van de Raad;  

– alle overeenkomsten of andere regelingen van kracht zijn waarin wordt bepaald dat alle betrokken afhankelijke of geassocieerde gebieden vanaf die datum automatische gegevensuitwisseling toepassen zoals voorgeschreven in hoofdstuk II van de richtlijn, of tijdens de in artikel 10 bepaalde overgangsperiode een bronbelasting toepassen die strookt met de in artikelen 11 en 12 vervatte voorwaarden.    

2. De Nederlandse Antillen liggen niet in het belastinggebied van de Europese Unie maar zijn, voor de toepassing van de richtlijn, een met de Europese Unie geassocieerd gebied en als zodanig niet aan het bepaalde in de richtlijn gebonden. Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden is evenwel bereid om ten behoeve van de Nederlandse Antillen, op basis van een overeenkomst tussen de Nederlandse Antillen en Nederland, met de lidstaten van de Europese Unie overeenkomsten te sluiten, houdende dat vanaf 1 januari 2005 tijdens de in artikel 10 van de richtlijn vastgestelde overgangsperiode een bronbelasting wordt toegepast die strookt met de in artikelen 11 en 12 van de richtlijn vervatte voorwaarden en na het verstrijken van de overgangsperiode automatische gegevensuitwisseling wordt toegepast zoals voorgeschreven in hoofdstuk II van de richtlijn.  

3. De in het vorige punt bedoelde overeenkomst tussen de Nederlandse Antillen en Nederland geldt op voorwaarde dat de lidstaten de wettelijke en bestuursrechtelijke bepalingen hebben vastgesteld die nodig zijn om te voldoen aan de richtlijn en dat aan de voorschriften van artikel 17 van de richtlijn is voldaan.  

4. Door middel van deze Overeenkomst stemmen de Nederlandse Antillen ermee in de bepalingen van de richtlijn met betrekking tot uiteindelijk gerechtigden met woonplaats in de Tsjechische Republiek toe te passen, onverminderd hetgeen overigens hierin is bepaald, en de Tsjechische Republiek stemt ermee in de richtlijn toe te passen met betrekking tot uiteindelijk gerechtigden met woonplaats in de Nederlandse Antillen.   De Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, ten behoeve van de Nederlandse Antillen, en de Regering van de Tsjechische Republiek, geleid door de wens een overeenkomst te sluiten die het mogelijk maakt dat inkomsten uit spaargelden in de vorm van rentebetaling die in een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten worden verricht aan uiteindelijk gerechtigden die een natuurlijke persoon zijn en hun woonplaats in de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Staat hebben, effectief worden belast overeenkomstig het recht van laatstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Staat, in overeenstemming met de richtlijn en met de hierboven door de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten geuite voornemens, zijn het volgende overeengekomen:  

### Artikel  1  

####Toepassingsgebied

2.  De werkingssfeer van deze Overeenkomst is beperkt tot belastingheffing op inkomsten uit spaargelden in de vorm van rente uit hoofde van schuldvorderingen; vraagstukken in verband met de fiscale behandeling van, onder meer, pensioenen en verzekeringsuitkeringen vallen buiten de werkingssfeer van deze Overeenkomst.

Gedurende deze periode zijn de Nederlandse Antillen niet gehouden de bepalingen van artikel 4 toe te passen. De Nederlandse Antillen ontvangen echter wel gegevens van de Tsjechische Republiek overeenkomstig dat artikel.   
2.  De uitbetalende instantie houdt de bronbelasting in op de wijze als omschreven in artikel 11, tweede en derde lid, van de richtlijn.   
3.  Het opleggen van bronbelasting door de Nederlandse Antillen belet de Tsjechische Republiek niet de inkomsten te belasten overeenkomstig het nationale recht van de Tsjechische Republiek.   
4.  Tijdens de overgangsperiode kunnen de Nederlandse Antillen bepalen dat een marktdeelnemer die rente uitbetaalt of een rentebetaling bewerkstelligt voor een in de Tsjechische Republiek gevestigde entiteit als bedoeld in artikel 4, tweede lid, van de richtlijn, wordt aangemerkt als de uitbetalende instantie in plaats van de entiteit, en dat hij de bronbelasting heft op die rente, tenzij de entiteit formeel heeft aanvaard dat haar naam en adres alsmede het totale bedrag van de rentebetaling die aan haar is verricht of voor haar is bewerkstelligd, worden meegedeeld overeenkomstig de laatste alinea van artikel 4, tweede lid.   
5.  Aan het einde van de overgangsperiode zullen de Nederlandse Antillen worden gevraagd de bepalingen van artikel 4 toe te passen en zullen de Nederlandse Antillen niet langer bronbelasting en verdeling van belastingopbrengsten als bedoeld in de artikelen 5 en 6 toepassen. Als de Nederlandse Antillen er tijdens de overgangsperiode voor kiezen de bepalingen van artikel 4 toe te passen, zullen zij niet langer bronbelasting en verdeling van belastingopbrengsten als bedoeld in de artikelen 5 en 6 toepassen.   

### Artikel  6  

####Verdeling van belastingopbrengsten

1.  De Nederlandse Antillen behouden 25% van de opbrengsten van de bronbelasting als bedoeld in artikel 5, eerste lid, en dragen 75% van de opbrengsten over aan de Tsjechische Republiek.   
2.  Indien de Nederlandse Antillen overeenkomstig artikel 5, vierde lid, bronbelasting heffen, behouden zij 25% van de opbrengsten van de bronbelasting geheven op rentebetalingen aan in de Tsjechische Republiek gevestigde entiteiten als bedoeld in artikel 4, tweede lid, van de richtlijn en dragen 75% over aan de Tsjechische Republiek.   
3.  Die overdrachten vinden uiterlijk plaats in de zes maanden volgende op het eind van het belastingjaar van de Nederlandse Antillen.   
4.  De Nederlandse Antillen treffen de maatregelen die nodig zijn om het systeem voor de verdeling van de belastingopbrengsten correct te doen functioneren.   

### Artikel  7  

####Uitzonderingen op de procedure van bronbelasting

1.  De Nederlandse Antillen voorzien in één van beide of beide procedures van artikel 13, eerste lid, van de richtlijn om te verzekeren dat uiteindelijk gerechtigden een verzoek kunnen indienen tot het niet-inhouden van bronbelasting.   
2.  Op verzoek van de uiteindelijk gerechtigde geeft de bevoegde autoriteit van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staat waar deze zijn fiscale woonplaats heeft een verklaring af overeenkomstig artikel 13, tweede lid, van de richtlijn.   

### Artikel  8  

####Voorkomen van dubbele belasting

De Tsjechische Republiek zorgt ervoor dat het heffen van bronbelasting als bedoeld in artikel 5 niet leidt tot dubbele belasting, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 14, tweede en derde lid, van de richtlijn, of zorgt voor restitutie van de bronbelasting.  

### Artikel  9  

####Andere bronbelastingen

De Overeenkomst belet de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten niet om, naast de bronbelasting als bedoeld in artikel 5, overeenkomstig hun nationale wetten en verdragen tot voorkoming van dubbele belasting, ook andere bronbelastingen te heffen.  

### Artikel  10  

####Omzetting

De Overeenkomstsluitende Staten dienen vóór 1 januari 2005 de wettelijke en bestuursrechtelijke bepalingen vast te stellen en bekend te maken die nodig zijn om aan deze Overeenkomst te voldoen.  

### Artikel  11  

####Bijlage

De teksten van de richtlijn en van artikel 7 van Richtlijn 77/799/EEG van de Raad van de Europese Unie van 19 december 1977 betreffende de wederzijdse bijstand van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de lidstaten op het gebied van de directe en indirecte belastingen, zoals die van toepassing zijn op de datum van ondertekening van deze Overeenkomst en waarnaar in deze Overeenkomst wordt verwezen, zijn als bijlage aan deze Overeenkomst gehecht en maken integraal deel daarvan uit. De tekst van artikel 7 van Richtlijn 77/799/EEG in deze bijlage wordt vervangen door de tekst van dat artikel in de gewijzigde Richtlijn 77/799/EEG indien deze gewijzigde richtlijn in werking treedt vóór de datum waarop de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst van kracht worden.  

### Artikel  12

Deze Overeenkomst treedt in werking op de dertigste dag na de laatste van de data waarop de respectieve regeringen elkaar er schriftelijk van in kennis hebben gesteld dat de in hun respectieve staten grondwettelijk voorgeschreven formaliteiten zijn vervuld en de bepalingen ervan vinden toepassing op de datum vanaf welke de richtlijn overeenkomstig artikel 17, tweede en derde lid, van de richtlijn van toepassing is.  

### Artikel  13  

####Beëindiging

Deze Overeenkomst blijft van kracht totdat zij door een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Staten wordt beëindigd. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Staat kan de Overeenkomst langs diplomatieke weg beëindigen door ten minste zes maanden voor het einde van enig kalenderjaar na het verstrijken van een tijdvak van drie jaar na de datum van inwerkingtreding van de Overeenkomst kennis te geven van beëindiging. In dat geval houdt de Overeenkomst op van kracht te zijn voor tijdvakken die aanvangen na het einde van het kalenderjaar waarin de kennisgeving van beëindiging is gegeven.

### Bijlage  

### Artikel  7  

####Geheimhouding

1.  Alle inlichtingen waarover een lidstaat uit hoofde van deze richtlijn beschikt, worden in deze lidstaat geheim gehouden op dezelfde wijze als geschiedt met de gegevens die deze lidstaat verkrijgt uit hoofde van de eigen nationale wetgeving. Hoe dan ook mogen deze inlichtingen: 

– alleen aan die personen ter kennis worden gebracht die bij de vaststelling van de belastingschuld of bij de administratieve controle in verband met de vaststelling van de belastingschuld rechtstreeks betrokken zijn,  

– alleen worden onthuld in gerechtelijke procedures of in procedures waarbij administratieve sancties worden toegepast, ingesteld met het oog op of in verband met de vaststelling van of de controle inzake de vaststelling van de belastingschuld, en alleen aan die personen die rechtstreeks bij deze procedures betrokken zijn; deze inlichtingen mogen echter tijdens openbare rechtszittingen of bij rechterlijke uitspraken worden vermeld, indien de bevoegde autoriteit van de lidstaat die de inlichtingen verstrekt, daar geen bezwaar tegen maakt op het moment dat zij de inlichtingen in eerste instantie verstrekt,  

– in geen geval worden gebruikt voor andere doeleinden dan fiscale doeleinden of gerechtelijke procedures of procedures waarbij administratieve sancties worden toegepast, ingesteld met het oog op of in verband met de vaststelling van of de controle inzake de vaststelling van de belastingschuld.   Bovendien kan door de lidstaten worden bepaald dat de in de eerste alinea bedoelde inlichtingen mogen worden gebruikt om andere heffingen, rechten en belastingen vast te stellen die vallen onder artikel 2 van Richtlijn 76/308/EEG.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het eerste lid houdt niet in dat een lidstaat waarvan de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk voor nationale doeleinden verdergaande beperkingen bevat dan die welke in dit lid zijn vervat, gehouden is tot het verstrekken van inlichtingen indien de Staat waarvoor deze zijn bestemd, zich niet verbindt deze verdergaande beperkingen in acht te nemen.   
3.  In afwijking van het bepaalde in het eerste lid kan de bevoegde autoriteit van de inlichtingen verstrekkende lidstaat toestaan dat in de lidstaat die om de inlichtingen verzoekt, deze ook voor andere doeleinden worden gebruikt, indien de wetgeving van de inlichtingen verstrekkende lidstaat in het eigen land een gelijksoortig gebruik onder overeenkomstige omstandigheden toestaat.   
4.  Wanneer de bevoegde autoriteit van een lidstaat van mening is dat de inlichtingen die zij van de bevoegde autoriteit van een andere lidstaat heeft ontvangen, van nut kunnen zijn voor de bevoegde autoriteit van een derde lidstaat, kan zij de betrokken inlichtingen met toestemming van de bevoegde autoriteit die de inlichtingen heeft verstrekt, doorgeven aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de derde lidstaat.
