– alleen worden onthuld in gerechtelijke procedures of in procedures waarbij administratieve sancties worden toegepast, ingesteld met het oog op of in verband met de vaststelling van of de controle inzake de vaststelling van de belastingschuld, en alleen aan die personen die rechtstreeks bij deze procedures betrokken zijn; deze inlichtingen mogen echter tijdens openbare rechtszittingen of bij rechterlijke uitspraken worden vermeld, indien de bevoegde autoriteit van de lidstaat die de inlichtingen verstrekt, daar geen bezwaar tegen maakt op het moment dat zij de inlichtingen in eerste instantie verstrekt,

3.  In afwijking van het bepaalde in het eerste lid kan de bevoegde autoriteit van de inlichtingen verstrekkende lidstaat toestaan dat in de lidstaat die de inlichtingen ontvangt, deze ook voor andere doeleinden worden gebruikt, indien de wetgeving van de inlichtingen verstrekkende lidstaat in het eigen land een gelijksoortig gebruik onder overeenkomstige omstandigheden toestaat.
