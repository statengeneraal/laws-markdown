### Nr.  I  

###Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken

The Hague, 13 February 2007 Dear Mr Secretary-General, I have the honour to refer to the discussions between the Ministry and NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Programme Management Agency (NAPMA) regarding employment opportunities of members of the families forming part of the household of the officials of NAPMA. In view of these discussions I have the honour to propose the following provisions:  

### Article  1  

Members of the family forming part of the household of all categories of officials in the service of NAPMA shall be authorised to engage in gainful employment in the Netherlands for the duration of the term of office of the officials concerned.  

### Article  2  

The following persons are members of the family forming part of the household in the sense of Article 1: 

a) the spouses or registered partners of officials in the service of NAPMA;  

b) children of officials in the service of NAPMA who are under the age of 18;  

c) children of officials in the service of NAPMA who are aged 18 or over, but not older than 27, provided that they formed part of the official’s household prior to their first entry into the Netherlands and still form part of this household, and that they are unmarried, financially dependent on the official concerned and are attending fulltime education in the Netherlands;  

d) children of officials in the service of NAPMA who are aged 18 or over, but not older than 23; they shall also be recognized as members of the family forming part of the household if they are not studying as long as they are unmarried and financially dependent on the official concerned.    

### Article  3  

Persons mentioned in Article 2 who obtain gainful employment shall enjoy no immunity from criminal, civil or administrative jurisdiction with respect to matters arising in the course of or in connection with such employment. However, any measures of execution shall be taken without infringing the inviolability of their person or of their residence, if they are entitled to such inviolability.  

### Article  4  

In case of the insolvency of a person aged under 18 with respect to a claim arising out of a gainful employment of that person, the immunity of the official in the service of NAPMA of whose family the person concerned is a member shall be waived for the purpose of settlement of the claim, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable NAPMA agreements.  

### Article  5  

The employment referred to in Article 1 shall be in accordance with Netherlands legislation, including fiscal and social security legislation, unless any other applicable international legal instrument provides otherwise. I have the honour to propose that if the provisions set forth above are acceptable to you the present letter and your affirmative reply constitute an Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with regard to the privileges and immuni-ties of NAPMA in the Netherlands, which shall enter into force on the date of receipt of your reply.  
Please accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration. BERNARD BOT Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  *North Atlantic Treaty Organisation*   *Att: the Secretary General, Mr De Hoop Scheffer*   *Blvd. Leopold III*   *1110 Brussels*   *Belgium*
