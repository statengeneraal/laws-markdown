### Nr.  I  

EMBASSY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS Nr. 15959 2nd September, 1970. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland providing for the Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements in Civil Matters, signed at The Hague on the 17th of November, 1967. I have been instructed by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to propose to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the operation of the above-mentioned Convention be extended, at the request of the Government of Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles, to these parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands outside Europe, in accordance with paragraph 1 (b) of Article X of the Convention and under the following specification provided for in paragraph 2 of the said Article: The courts to whose judgements the Convention shall apply are: 

1) in the case of Surinam: the „Hof van Justitie van Suriname”, the „Kantongerecht in het Eerste Kanton” and the „Kantongerecht in het Derde Kanton”;  

2) in the case of the Netherlands Antilles: the „Hoge Raad der Nederlanden”, the „Hof van Justitie der Nederlandse Antillen” and the „Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg”.   The courts to which application for registration of any judgement shall be made are: 

1) in the case of Surinam: the „Hof van Justitie van Suriname”;  

2) in the case of the Netherlands Antilles: the „Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg” having jurisdiction in the district where the judgement debtor has his domicile or has assets.   If the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I have the honour further to propose that the present Note together with your reply to that effect shall constitute an agreement between the two Governments in this matter, which shall enter into force, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article X of the Convention, one month after the date of your reply and shall be subject to termination in conformity with the paragraphs 5 and 6 of the said Article. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (sd.) J. L. R. HUYDECOPER  *The Right Honourable*   *Sir Alec Douglas-Home, K. T., M. P.*   *etc., etc., etc.*
