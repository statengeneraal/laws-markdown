In the course of subsequent negotiations on November 23, 1967, it was understood between a Danish and a Netherlands delegation that, pursuant to articles 3 and 4 of the European Fisheries Convention, Netherlands traditional fisheries should be defined as fisheries directed towards plaice and sole in the area between the Danish/ German border in the North Sea and the parallel of the latitude through Bovbjerg lighthouse. It was further understood that, pursuant to article 9, section 1, of the Fisheries Convention, the Netherlands traditional fisheries as described above should be allowed to continue in the belt between 3 and 6 nautical miles from the base lines until July 1, 1968. After that date the Netherlands traditional fisheries as described above should be allowed to continue in the belt between 6 and 12 miles from the base lines. The Danish Government accepts the above understandings. If the foregoing is also acceptable to the Government of the Netherlands, the Embassy has the honour to propose that the present note and the reply of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs constitute an arrangement between the two Governments in this matter. The Royal Danish Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the assurances of its highest consideration.
