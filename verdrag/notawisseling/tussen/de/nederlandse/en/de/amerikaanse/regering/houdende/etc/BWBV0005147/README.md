### No.  I  

###AMERICAN EMBASSY

The Hague, Netherlands, December 14, 1954. Excellencies: I refer to the statement of the United States Permanent Representative to the NATO Council on November 10, 1954, regarding the establishment of a SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center. As you know, the Center will be an adjunct of SHAPE and its purpose will be to provide technical advice and assistance to SHAPE in connection with the Air Defense of NATO, so as to strengthen further the defenses of the North Atlantic Area and to facilitate the effective participation of the NATO nations in the United Nations system for collective security. As a means of establishing and operating the center for the benefit of SHAPE and NATO nations and to achieve the purpose mentioned above, the Government of the United States, under the authority of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, is considering entering into a contract with the „Rijksverdedigings Organisatie TNO” (RVO-TNO) (National Defense Research Council TNO). I enclose as an attachment to this letter a copy of the agreed draft text of this contract. It will be seen that this contract would permit RVO-TNO to carry out its contractual responsibilities through the agency of a foundation to be established in the Netherlands under RVO-TNO and to be designated the SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center (ADTC, sometimes herein called the Center). In order to enable the Center to perform its functions it is in the opinion of my Government essential that your Government support the establishment and operation of the Center in the Netherlands and that it be in agreement with the terms of the contract between my Government and RVO-TNO now under consideration. I would appreciate hearing from the Netherlands Government that this is the case and that the Netherlands Government is prepared to make such arrangements as will enable the Center to operate effectively in accordance with the contract. Prior to concluding any contractual agreement with RVO-TNO my Government desires to be informed about the arrangements, which will be made by your Government in the following particulars: 

a) The establishment and operation of the NATO security system at the Center;  

b) The provision of classified communication facilities and services;  

c) The provision of the attributes of international status for the Center;  

d) The provision of housing for the foreign personnel of the Center;  

e) The audit of expenditures made in connection with the proposed contract between RVO-TNO and the Government of the United States;  

f) The safeguarding of the security of patent applications and the facilitating of the implementation of the patent provisions of the contract;  

g) The provision of the necessary land;  

h) The exemption of United States expenditures under this contract from taxes;  

i) The protection of the United States from liability;  

j) The utilization by the United States of local currency for purposes of discharging its contract obligations;  

k) Special arrangements for the Center regarding foreign exchange;  

l) The determination of residual value of any immovable property erected on property owned or used by the Center;  

m) The granting of waiver, release or licences from or under regulations affecting the procurement of goods and services;  

n) The facilitating of subcontracting both within and outside the Netherlands.   Furthermore, for the proper execution of the functions of the officer designated as United States Advisor, in accordance with the contract between my Government and RVO-TNO, it would be appreciated if the United States Advisor and the members of his official staff may be accorded appropriate privileges. Finally, when in the future my Government announces its desire to withdraw from, terminate, or otherwise alter its contractual relationship with RVO-TNO so as to transfer its rights and responsibilities to SHAPE or to some designated subsidiary body of the North Atlantic Council, it will be necessary that such transfer be facilitated by your Government and that arrangements, rights and immunities equivalent to those accorded by you to the Center, be accorded to SHAPE or such designated subsidiary body of the North Atlantic Council, as well as to RVO-TNO, the Center and all personnel thereof, unless otherwise agreed with the proper NATO authorities. Please accept, Excellencies, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. (sd.) H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS  *Their Excellencies*   *J. W. Beyen,*   *Minister for Foreign Affairs,*   *and J. M. A. H. Luns,*   *Minister without Portfolio,*   *Royal Netherlands Ministry*   *for Foreign Affairs,*   *The Hague.*    

### No.  II  

The Hague, December 14, 1954. Dear Mr. Ambassador, 

1. Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of today regarding the establishment of a SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center. We can assure you that the Netherlands Government are happy to act as host nation for the Center and are fully in agreement with the plan for establishing and operating this Center for the benefit of SHAPE and the NATO nations. The Netherlands Government have noted with approval the contract which your Government under the authority of the Mutual Security Act are considering entering into with the National Defense Research Council - Central National Council for Applied Scientific Research in the Netherlands (RVO-TNO).  

2. Our Government are likewise of the opinion that it is essential for the operation of the Center that certain special arrangements be made for it. In reply to the specific questions raised in your letter and in confirmation of the oral assurances which have been given by our officials to your representatives, we are pleased to give the following undertakings:  

3. As to the establishment and operation of the NATO security system, our Government, in accordance with NATO precedents and without charge to the United States or the Center, will in particular do the following: 

a. Assume responsibility for establishing and maintaining security measures at the Center and at the facilities of subcontractors within the Netherlands. These security measures will extend to the protection of buildings and other property and to the grading, handling, transmission, storage and distribution of documents and material and to all other matters relating to the security protection of information. The standards for these security measures will be at least as high as those required by the security regulations of NATO.  

b. Assume responsibility for verifying the security status of all personnel employed at or assigned to the Center or employed by subcontractors engaged in the performance of work for the Center within the Netherlands. This will include security clearances for all such personnel who are Netherlands nationals. The standards for these clearances shall be at least as high as those required by the Netherlands Government for the assignment of its nationals to the NATO International Staff.  

c. Before subcontracts involving classified information are placed with subcontractors outside the Netherlands, assure that arrangements are in effect by which the government of the country in which the subcontractor is located will be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of security measures in connection with these facilities and personnel of the subcontractor substantially corresponding to those required for the Netherlands Government under sub-paragraphs *a* and *b* above.    

4. In accordance with NATO precedents, our Government will provide such classified communication facilities and services as may be necessary for the receipt and despatch of classified information for the Center. Such communication facilities shall, of course, be operated in accordance with the NATO security regulations.  

5. Our Government will provide attributes of international status for the Center in order that it may function properly and effectively as an adjunct of SHAPE. Therefore, in addition to the arrangements for the status of personnel set forth in the letter of the Minister of Defense of 14 December 1954 to General Gruenther the following provisions for the status of the Center as such will be made by our Government in anticipation of the implementation of Ambassador Hughes' declaration of November 10, 1954 to the NATO Council and also in anticipation of the transfer of the Center to SHAPE or some designated subsidiary body of the NATO Council, whenever NATO may so desire: 

a. All property, both movable and immovable, furnished to or acquired by or on behalf of the Center, including such property owned, acquired or held by RVO-TNO on behalf of the Center, shall be: 

(i) exempt from all direct taxes; the Center will not, however, claim exemption from rates, taxes or dues which are no more than charges for public utility services;  

(ii) exempt from all customs duties, export taxes and quantitative restrictions on imports and exports in respect of articles imported or exported by or for the Center. However, articles imported under such exemption shall not be disposed of by way of either sale or gift in the Netherlands, except under conditions approved by the Netherlands Government;  

(iii) immune from search, requisition, confiscation or expropriation.    

b. All documents and records belonging to or held by or on behalf of or for the use of the Center shall be inviolable wherever located.  

c. No censorship shall be applied to correspondence or other communications despatched or received in connection with the operation of the Center. The Center shall have the right to use codes and to dispatch correspondence by courier or in sealed bags which shall have the same immunities and privileges as diplomatic couriers and bags.    

6. In consideration of the fact that your Government are prepared in accordance with the agreed draft contract with RVO-TNO to provide in appropriate cases for housing allowances for personnel, our Government are prepared to assure, if necessary, by allocations from the defense housing program, that adequate housing shall be made available for the foreign personnel of the Center.  

7. Our Government are prepared on the request of your Government to perform, without cost to the United States, the audit of all expenditures made by RVO-TNO under the contract with your Government, and to certify vouchers for payment by your Government in the same manner that such audit and certification are carried out in connection with defense contracts of our Government.  

8. With respect to patents 

a. Our Government will take appropriate steps in accordance with NATO security regulations to safeguard the security of applications for Netherlands patents where the subject matter of such applications is classified, and the invention has been developed under the contract between your Government and RVO-TNO;  

b. Our Government undertake that they will cooperate in and facilitate the implementation of the patent provisions of the contract between the United States and RVO-TNO or of any subcontract made thereunder.    

9. Public lands will be made available by the Netherlands Government to the extent necessary for the operation of the Center, without cost to the United States Government.  

10. As regards the exemption from taxes of United States expenditures under the contract between your Government and RVO-TNO and as regards the protection of the United States from liability, we are happy to give assurance that Articles 11 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding between our two Governments relating to Offshore Procurement, which entered into force July 30th, 1954, shall be fully applicable, as well as paragraphs 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 15 of the same Memorandum.  

11. The United States, for the purpose of discharging its obligations under the contract, will be free to use any guilders owned by the United States.  

12. The Center may hold currency of any kind and operate accounts in any currency, and the Netherlands authorities, if so required for effective operations of the Center, will facilitate transfers of funds held by the Center from one to another country, and the conversion of any currency held by the Center into any other currency.  

13. The Netherlands Government will assure that all buildings or other facilities of an immovable character furnished by the United States Government, or any other NATO nations, to or for the Center, or constructed or acquired for the Center, shall remain available to the Center as long as required for the purposes set forth in this letter, and will take appropriate measures to assure that when such property is no longer required for the operations of the Center, the residual value thereof, if any, will be reimbursed to the Government of the United States or to any other NATO government to such extent as is proportionate to each government's contribution to the particular property.  

14. Our Government are prepared upon request to grant waiver or release or licenses, whichever is applicable, from or under regulations affecting the procurement of goods, materials and services in the Netherlands by or for the Center.  

15. In appropriate cases RVO-TNO or the Center may subcontract for equipment, materials and services with non-Netherlands suppliers located either within or outside the Netherlands. Our Government will, upon request, use their good offices to facilitate the placing of such contracts.  

16. If your Government so request, the principal United States officer designated as United States Advisor to the Center and the members of his official staff, will be accorded the privileges provided in subparagraphs (*b*) and (*c*) of Annex E of the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement signed between the United States and the Netherlands on January 27, 1950.  

17. We confirm that it is the intention of our Government, when in the future the United States announces its desire to withdraw from, terminate, or otherwise alter its contractual relationship with RVO-TNO so as to transfer its rights and responsibilities to SHAPE or to some designated subsidiary body of the North Atlantic Council, to facilitate such transfer and to accord to SHAPE or such designated subsidiary body of the North Atlantic Council, as well as to RVO-TNO, the Center and all personnel thereof, arrangements, rights and immunities equivalent to those outlined above, unless otherwise agreed with the proper NATO authorities.  

18. We can assure you that our Government will further the aims of the Center as far as possible, will take the actions contemplated above with utmost promptness, and will support the performance of the contract by RVO-TNO. Wherever the draft contract provides for action or support by the Netherlands Government, the Netherlands Government will take such action and give such support.  

19. Upon receipt of Your Excellency's acceptance of the arrangements set forth herein, Your Excellency's abovementioned letter, this letter and Your Excellency's reply shall constitute an agreement between our two Governments which agreement shall forthwith enter into force, subject in the case of the Netherlands to the provisions of Article 62 paragraph 1, sub *d,* and paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

###ALLIED POWERS EUROPE

###SUPREME COMMANDER

14 December 1954 Dear Minister Staf, It is, I am convinced, a matter of urgency that there be promptly established a SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center. Discussions have indicated the desirability of locating this in The Netherlands. To accelerate this project, the United States has indicated its willingness to provide for several years, subject to availability of funds, for the cost of the Center. As Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, I would plan to invite the Ministers of Defense of the respective NATO countries to make available technical and scientific personnel to participate in the work of the Center. I have seen the proposed contract for the Center between the Government of the United States and the National Defense Research Council - Central National Council for Applied Scientific Research in The Netherlands (RVO-TNO), together with the proposed letters on the subject to be exchanged between the appropriate authorities of the Governments of The Netherlands and of the United States of America. I shall be happy to accept the services of the Center, which will be an adjunct of SHAPE. In order to facilitate the securing from the NATO nations of scientific and technical personnel of outstanding qualifications, I would hope that they might be granted, in anticipation of the implementation of Ambassador Hughes' declaration of November 10, 1954, to the NATO Council, by your government a status suitable for foreign experts engaged in such an international enterprise. The obtaining of such scientists and technical experts is indispensable to the success of the Center. I would also hope that you will accord an appropriate status to the Center itself. So far as lies in my power as SACEUR I shall, of course, do everything possible to facilitate the establishment of the Center and to support the conduct of its work. Sincerely, (sd.) Alfred M. GRUENTHER General, United States Army  *His Excellency*   *Ir. C. Staf,*   *The Minister of Defense,*   *Plein 4, The Hague, The Netherlands.*    

The Hague, December 14, 1954. Dear General Gruenther, I thank you for your letter of December 14, 1954, relative to the SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center. My Government has taken note with much satisfaction of the plan to locate this Center in the Netherlands and is willing to take, in anticipation of the transfer of the Center, whenever NATO may desire, to SHAPE or some designated subsidiary body of the NATO Council, all necessary measures within its power, including those requested in your letter, to facilitate the establishment and to further the work of the Center. As to the status in the Netherlands of the foreign personnel employed by or assigned to the Center, my Government are prepared to grant the following: 

1) inviolability for all papers and documents relating to the work on which they are engaged for the Center. The same shall also be granted to Netherlands personnel employed at or assigned to the Center;  

2) the same immunities from immigration restrictions, aliens' registration, and national service obligations, as are accorded to diplomatic personnel of comparable rank. The same shall be granted to their spouses and members of their immediate families residing with and dependent on them;  

3) the same facilities in respect of currency or exchange restrictions as are accorded to diplomatic personnel of comparable rank;  

4) the right to import free of duty their furniture and effects at the time of first arrival to take up their post at the Center or at the time of first arrival of their spouses and members of their immediate families, as mentioned under 2) above, to join them; and on the termination of their functions at the Center, to re-export such furniture and effects free of duty, subject in all cases to such conditions as my Government may deem necessary;  

5) the right to import temporarily free of duty their private motor vehicles for their own personal use and subsequently to re-export such vehicles free of duty, subject in either case to such conditions as my Government may deem necessary;  

6) the exemption from taxation on the salaries and emoluments paid to them by the Center in consequence of their employment;

Om het Centrum op te richten en te doen functioneren ten behoeve van SHAPE en de NAVO-landen en om de hierboven genoemde doelstelling te verwezenlijken, overweegt de Regering van de Verenigde Staten om, krachtens de Wet nopens de Wederzijdse Beveiliging van 1954, een contract te sluiten met de Rijksverdedigingsorganisatie TNO (RVO-TNO). Ik sluit als bijlage bij deze brief een afschrift in van de aanvaarde ontwerp-tekst van dit contract. Naar daaruit blijkt zal dit contract de RVO-TNO in staat stellen haar contractuele verplichtingen na te komen door middel van een stichting, welke in Nederland zal worden opgericht onder auspiciën van de RVO-TNO en welke genoemd zal worden het Technisch Studiecentrum van SHAPE voor de Luchtverdediging (SHAPE Air Defense Technical Center) (ADTC, hierin ook wel genoemd het Centrum). <sup> 1)  [Red: SHAPE is het Hoofdkwartier van de Geallieerde Strijdkrachten in Europa (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe). Vgl. de resolutie van de Noord-Atlantische Raad van 19 December 1950 (*Trb.* 1951, 66).]  </sup> Om het Centrum in staat te stellen zijn taak te vervullen is het naar de mening van mijn Regering noodzakelijk dat Uw Regering de oprichting en het doen functioneren van het Centrum in Nederland ondersteunt en dat Uw Regering instemt met de bepalingen van het contract tussen mijn Regering en de RVO-TNO, zoals dit thans wordt overwogen. Ik zou het op prijs stellen van de Nederlandse Regering te vernemen, dat zulks inderdaad het geval is en dat de Nederlandse Regering bereid is die regelingen te treffen, die het Centrum in staat zullen stellen zijn werkzaamheden in overeenstemming met het contract doeltreffend te verrichten. Alvorens enige contractuele overeenkomst met de RVO-TNO aan te gaan, wenst mijn Regering te worden ingelicht aangaande de regelingen, die Uw Regering zal treffen, in het bijzonder ten aanzien van de volgende onderwerpen: 

a) de invoering en de werking van het beveiligingsstelsel van de NAVO bij het Centrum;  

b) de verschaffing van gerubriceerde verbindings-faciliteiten en -diensten;  

c) de verlening van de kenmerken van een internationale rechtspositie aan het Centrum;  

d) de verschaffing van huisvesting voor het buitenlandse personeel van het Centrum;  

e) de verificatie van de uitgaven, welke gedaan worden met betrekking tot het voorgestelde contract tussen de RVO-TNO en de Regering der Verenigde Staten;  

f) de waarborging van de beveiliging van octrooi-aanvragen en het bevorderen van de tenuitvoerlegging van de octrooibepalingen van het contract;  

g) de terbeschikkingstelling van de benodigde grond;  

h) de belastingvrijstelling van uitgaven, welke door de Verenigde Staten uit hoofde van dit contract worden gedaan;  

i) de vrijwaring van de Verenigde Staten tegen aansprakelijkheid;  

j) het gebruik door de Verenigde Staten van valuta van het land waar betaling moet geschieden ter voldoening aan haar contractuele verplichtingen;  

k) bijzondere regelingen voor het Centrum betreffende buitenlandse betaalmiddelen;  

l) de bepaling van de restwaarde van enig onroerend goed, gebouwd op land in eigendom van of in gebruik bij het Centrum;  

m) de verlening van vrijstelling, ontheffing of vergunningen van of krachtens voorschriften, betrekking hebbende op het verschaffen van goederen en diensten;  

n) de vergemakkelijking van het sluiten van subcontracten, zowel in als buiten Nederland.   Om een juiste uitoefening mogelijk te maken van de taak van de functionaris, aangewezen als Adviseur van de Verenigde Staten, in overeenstemming met het tussen mijn Regering en de RVO-TNO gesloten contract, zou het voorts op prijs worden gesteld als aan de Adviseur van de Verenigde Staten en de leden van zijn officiële staf passende voorrechten zouden kunnen worden verleend. Wanneer tenslotte in de toekomst mijn Regering de wens te kennen geeft zich terug te willen trekken uit haar contractuele verhouding met de RVO-TNO, deze te willen beëindigen of anderszins te wijzigen, teneinde haar rechten en verantwoordelijkheden over te dragen aan SHAPE of enig daartoe aangewezen orgaan van de Noord-Atlantische Raad, zal het noodzakelijk zijn, dat zodanige overdracht door Uw Regering wordt vergemakkelijkt en dat aan SHAPE of aan zodanig daartoe aangewezen orgaan van de Noord-Atlantische Raad, evenals aan de RVO-TNO, het Centrum en al het daartoe behorende personeel, rechten en immuniteiten zullen worden verleend en regelingen te hunnen behoeve zullen worden getroffen, gelijkwaardig aan die, welke door U aan het Centrum zijn verleend of te zijnen behoeve zijn getroffen, tenzij met de bevoegde NAVO-autoriteiten anders zal worden overeengekomen. Gelief, Excellenties, de hernieuwde verzekering mijner bijzondere hoogachting te aanvaarden. (w.g.) H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS  *Aan Hunne Excellenties*   *J. W. Beyen, Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken, en*   *J. M. A. H. Luns, Minister zonder Portefeuille,*   *Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken,*   *'s-Gravenhage*    

### No.  II  

's-Gravenhage, 14 December 1954. Mijnheer de Ambassadeur, 

1. Wij bevestigen de ontvangst van Uw brief van heden betreffende de oprichting van een Technisch Studiecentrum van SHAPE voor de Luchtverdediging. Wij kunnen U de verzekering geven dat de Nederlandse Regering gaarne zal optreden als gastheer-land voor het Centrum en dat zij volledig instemt met het plan voor het oprichten en doen functioneren van dit Centrum ten behoeve van SHAPE en de NAVO-landen. De Nederlandse Regering heeft met instemming kennis genomen van het contract, dat Uw Regering, krachtens de Wet nopens de Wederzijdse Beveiliging, overweegt te sluiten met de Rijksverdedigingsorganisatie TNO (RVO-TNO).  

2. Onze Regering is eveneens van mening, dat het voor het functioneren van het Centrum noodzakelijk is, dat daarvoor bijzondere regelingen worden getroffen. In antwoord op de specifieke vragen, gesteld in Uw brief en ter bevestiging van de mondelinge verzekeringen welke door onze ambtenaren aan Uw vertegenwoordigers zijn gegeven, hebben wij het genoegen U de navolgende toezeggingen te doen:  

3. Wat betreft de invoering en de werking van het beveiligingsstelsel van de NAVO zal onze Regering, in overeenstemming met overeenkomstige gebruiken in de NAVO en zonder kosten voor de Verenigde Staten of het Centrum, in het bijzonder het navolgende verrichten: 

a. De verantwoordelijkheid op zich nemen voor de instelling en de handhaving van beveiligingsmaatregelen bij het Centrum en bij de subcontractanten in Nederland. Deze beveiligingsmaatregelen zullen omvatten de bescherming van gebouwen en andere eigendommen, alsmede het classificeren, behandelen, overbrengen, opbergen en distribueren van documenten en materiaal, en alle andere aangelegenheden betreffende de beveiliging van gegevens. De maatstaven voor deze beveiligingsmaatregelen zullen tenminste even hoog zijn als die, vereist door de beveiligingsvoorschriften van de NAVO.  

b. De verantwoordelijkheid op zich nemen voor de contrôle op de „security status” van al het personeel in dienst van of te werk gesteld bij het Centrum of in dienst van subcontractanten, betrokken bij het verrichten van werk voor het Centrum in Nederland, met inbegrip van „security clearances” voor personeel van Nederlandse nationaliteit. De maatstaven voor deze „clearances” zullen tenminste even hoog zijn als die welke door de Nederlandse Regering worden vereist bij tewerkstelling van haar onderdanen bij de Internationale Staf van de NAVO. <sup> 1)  [Red: Het geen gevaar opleveren voor de veiligheid.]  </sup> <sup> 2)  [Red: Verklaringen, dat de betrokken personen geen gevaar opleveren voor de veiligheid.]  </sup>  

c. Ervoor zorgen dat, alvorens met subcontractanten buiten Nederland subcontracten worden gesloten, waarmede gerubriceerde gegevens zijn gemoeid, regelingen zijn getroffen waardoor de Regering van het land, waarin de subcontractant gevestigd is, verantwoordelijk zal zijn voor de instelling en handhaving van beveiligingsmaatregelen met betrekking tot deze inrichting en het personeel van de subcontractant, welke regelingen in hoofdzaak overeenstemmen met die vereist door de Nederlandse Regering, als genoemd onder *a* en *b* hierboven.    

4. In overeenstemming met overeenkomstige gebruiken in de NAVO zal onze Regering zodanige gerubriceerde verbindingsmiddelen en -diensten ter beschikking stellen als nodig kunnen zijn voor de ontvangst en de verzending van gerubriceerde berichten voor het Centrum. Zodanige verbindingsfaciliteiten zullen vanzelfsprekend worden gebruikt overeenkomstig de veiligheidsvoorschriften van de NAVO.  

5. Onze Regering zal aan het Centrum voorrechten toekennen, kenmerkend voor een internationale rechtspositie, opdat het goed en doeltreffend kan functioneren als een aan SHAPE toegevoegd orgaan. Onverminderd de regelingen voor de rechtspositie van het personeel, uiteengezet in de brief van de Minister van Oorlog van 14 December 1954 aan Generaal Gruenther, zullen daarom de volgende voorzieningen voor de rechtspositie van het Centrum als zodanig door onze Regering worden getroffen, vooruitlopende op de tenuitvoerlegging van de verklaring van Ambassadeur Hughes van 10 November 1954 in de Noord-Atlantische Raad en eveneens vooruitlopende op de overdracht van het Centrum aan SHAPE of een daartoe aangewezen orgaan van de Noord-Atlantische Raad, wanneer de NAVO zulks mocht wensen: 

a. Alle goederen, zowel roerend als onroerend, geleverd aan of verkregen door of ten behoeve van het Centrum, met inbegrip van die goederen welke eigendom zijn van, verkregen zijn door, of in het bezit zijn van de RVO-TNO ten behoeve van het Centrum, zullen zijn: 

(i) vrijgesteld van alle directe belastingen; het Centrum zal echter geen aanspraak maken op vrijstelling van tarieven, belastingen of rechten, die slechts bestaan uit kosten voor openbare diensten;  

(ii) vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, uitvoerbelastingen en quantitatieve beperkingen op invoer en uitvoer met betrekking tot goederen, in- of uitgevoerd door of voor het Centrum. Goederen die onder een zodanige vrijstelling zijn ingevoerd, mogen evenwel niet van de hand worden gedaan door verkoop of door schenking in Nederland, behoudens onder door de Nederlandse Regering goedgekeurde voorwaarden.  

(iii) gevrijwaard tegen huiszoeking en visitatie, vordering, verbeurdverklaring of onteigening.    

b. Alle documenten en archieven behorende aan of in het bezit van het Centrum, of in het bezit van anderen ten behoeve of ten gebruike van het Centrum, zullen onschendbaar zijn, waar zij zich ook bevinden.  

c. Op de correspondentie of andere berichten, verzonden of ontvangen in verband met de werkzaamheid van het Centrum, zal geen censuur worden toegepast. Het Centrum zal het recht hebben van codes gebruik te maken en correspondentie te verzenden per koerier of in verzegelde postzakken, waarvoor dezelfde immuniteiten en voorrechten zullen gelden als voor diplomatieke koeriers en postzakken.    

6. In verband met het feit dat Uw Regering bereid is om, in overeenstemming met het overeengekomen ontwerp-contract met de RVO-TNO, in daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen kosten voor huisvesting van personeel te vergoeden, is onze Regering bereid er zo nodig voor te zorgen dat, door middel van toewijzing uit het voor het Ministerie van Oorlog bestemde deel van het woningbouwprogramma, passende huisvesting voor het buitenlandse personeel van het Centrum beschikbaar zal worden gesteld.  

7. Onze Regering is bereid, op verzoek van Uw Regering, zonder kosten voor de Verenigde Staten, alle uitgaven gedaan door de RVO-TNO bij de uitvoering van het contract met Uw Regering te verifiëren, en kasstukken voor betalingen door Uw Regering te waarmerken op dezelfde wijze als zodanige verificatie en waarmerking worden uitgevoerd ten aanzien van defensie-contracten van onze Regering.  

8. Ten aanzien van octrooien: 

a. zal onze Regering de nodige stappen doen in overeenstemming met de beveiligingsvoorschriften van de NAVO om de beveiliging van Nederlandse octrooi-aanvragen te verzekeren, wanneer het onderwerp van die aanvragen gerubriceerd is en de uitvinding ontwikkeld is onder het contract tussen Uw Regering en de RVO-TNO;  

b. neemt onze Regering op zich, te zullen medewerken aan de tenuitvoerlegging van de op octrooien betrekking hebbende bepalingen in het contract tussen de Verenigde Staten en de RVO-TNO of in enig krachtens dat contract tot stand gekomen subcontract, en deze tenuitvoerlegging te zullen vergemakkelijken.    

9. De Nederlandse Regering zal, zonder kosten voor de Regering van de Verenigde Staten, grond ter beschikking stellen voorzover zulks nodig is voor het doen functioneren van het Centrum.  

10. Wat betreft de belastingvrijstelling van uitgaven van de Verenigde Staten voortvloeiende uit het contract tussen Uw Regering en de RVO-TNO, en wat betreft de vrijwaring van de Verenigde Staten voor aansprakelijkheid, hebben wij het genoegen U de verzekering te geven, dat de paragrafen 11 en 13 van het Memorandum van Overeenkomst tussen onze beide Regeringen betreffende „Offshore Procurement”, dat op 30 Juli 1954 in werking is getreden, volledig van toepassing zullen zijn, evenals de paragrafen 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 en 15 van dat Memorandum.  

11. De Verenigde Staten zullen, ter kwijting van hun verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit het contract, de vrijheid hebben gebruik te maken van elk gulden-bezit van de Verenigde Staten.  

12. Het Centrum mag valuta van iedere soort in zijn bezit hebben en rekeningen houden in iedere valuta en de Nederlandse autoriteiten zullen, indien zulks ten behoeve van het doeltreffend functioneren van het Centrum vereist is, de overmaking van gelden in het bezit van het Centrum van een land naar een ander land, alsmede de omzetting van iedere valuta in het bezit van het Centrum in iedere andere valuta, vergemakkelijken.  

13. Onze Regering zal ervoor zorg dragen, dat alle gebouwen of andere inrichtingen van onroerende aard, door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten of enig ander NAVO-land aan of ten behoeve van het Centrum verschaft, of vervaardigd of verworven ten behoeve van het Centrum, ter beschikking van het Centrum blijven zolang als zulks vereist is voor de in deze brief uiteengezette doeleinden; zij zal de nodige maatregelen treffen om te verzekeren dat, wanneer zodanige eigendom niet langer vereist is voor de werkzaamheden van het Centrum, de eventuele restwaarde daarvan zal worden teruggestort aan de Regering van de Verenigde Staten of aan de Regering van enig ander NAVO-land, in een zodanige verhouding als overeenkomt met de bijdrage van elk der Regeringen aan de betreffende eigendom.  

14. Onze Regering is bereid desgevraagd vrijstelling, ontheffing of vergunning, al naar het geval zich voordoet, te verlenen van of krachtens voorschriften die betrekking hebben op de verschaffing van goederen, materialen en diensten in Nederland door of ten behoeve van het Centrum.  

15. In daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen kunnen de RVO-TNO of het Centrum subcontracten sluiten voor uitrusting, materialen en diensten met niet-Nederlandse leveranciers, gevestigd hetzij in, hetzij buiten Nederland. Onze Regering zal desgevraagd haar goede diensten bewijzen om het sluiten van dergelijke contracten te vergemakkelijken.  

16. Indien Uw Regering zulks verzoekt, zullen aan de leidende Amerikaanse functionaris, aangewezen als adviseur van de Verenigde Staten bij het Centrum, en aan de leden van zijn ambtelijke staf de voorrechten worden verleend als voorzien onder (*b*) en (*c*) van Bijlage E van het op 27 Januari 1950 tussen de Nederlandse en de Amerikaanse Regering gesloten Verdrag tot wederzijdse hulpverlening inzake verdediging.  

17. Wij bevestigen dat het in het voornemen van onze Regering ligt om, wanneer in de toekomst de Verenigde Staten de wens te kennen geven zich terug te willen trekken uit hun contractuele verhouding met de RVO-TNO, deze te willen beëindigen of anderszins te wijzigen, teneinde hun rechten en verantwoordelijkheden over te dragen aan SHAPE of enig daartoe aangewezen orgaan van de Noord-Atlantische Raad, zodanige overdracht te vergemakkelijken en aan SHAPE of aan zodanig daartoe aangewezen orgaan van de Noord-Atlantische Raad, evenals aan de RVO-TNO, het Centrum en al het daartoe behorende personeel, rechten en immuniteiten te verlenen en te hunnen behoeve regelingen te treffen gelijkwaardig aan die, welke boven zijn omschreven, tenzij anders zal worden overeengekomen met de bevoegde NAVO-autoriteiten.  

18. Wij kunnen U de verzekering geven, dat onze Regering de doelstellingen van het Centrum zoveel mogelijk zal bevorderen, met de grootste spoed de hierboven beoogde stappen zal ondernemen en de uitvoering van het contract door de RVO-TNO zal ondersteunen. Telkens waar het ontwerp-contract voorziet in stappen van of ondersteuning door de Nederlandse Regering, zal deze Regering zodanige stappen ondernemen en zodanige ondersteuning verlenen.  

19. Na ontvangst van de aanvaarding door Uwe Excellentie van de hierboven uiteengezette regelingen, zullen de hierboven genoemde brief van Uwe Excellentie, deze brief en Uwer Excellentie's antwoord een Overeenkomst vormen tussen onze beide Regeringen, welke Overeenkomst onmiddellijk in werking treedt, onder voorbehoud, voor wat Nederland betreft, van de bepalingen van Artikel 62, eerste lid onder *d)* en lid 2 van de Grondwet.   Gelief, Mijnheer de Ambassadeur, de hernieuwde verzekering van onze bijzondere hoogachting te aanvaarden. De Minister zonder Portefeuille, (w.g.) J. LUNS De Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken, (w.g.) J. W. BEYEN  *Aan Zijne Excellentie*   *H. Freeman Matthews,*   *Buitengewoon en Gevolmachtigd Ambassadeur*   *van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika,*   *'s-Gravenhage.*

###AMERIKAANSE AMBASSADE

's-Gravenhage, 14 December 1954. Excellenties, In overeenstemming met de besprekingen welke hebben plaatsgevonden, gelet op en in vertrouwen op de bij deze besprekingen ontvangen mondelinge verzekeringen en in het bijzonder gelet op en in vertrouwen op de aangegane verplichtingen, uiteengezet in Uw brief van 14 December 1954, heeft mijn Regering besloten voort te gaan met de plannen voor de oprichting in Nederland van een Technisch Studiecentrum van SHAPE voor de Luchtverdediging. Zij zal daartoe het aanvaarde ontwerp-contract tussen de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en de RVO-TNO, gedateerd 14 December 1954, ondertekenen. Gelief, Excellenties, de hernieuwde verzekering mijner bijzondere hoogachting te aanvaarden. (w.g) H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS  *Aan Hunne Excellenties*   *J. W.
