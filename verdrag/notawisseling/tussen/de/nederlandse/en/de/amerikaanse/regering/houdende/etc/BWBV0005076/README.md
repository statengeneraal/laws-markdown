###DEPARTMENT OF STATE

###WASHINGTON

The Secretary of State presents his compliments to His Excellency the Ambassador of the Netherlands and has the honor to call to the latter's attention recent conversations between representatives of the Department of the Air Force and the Netherlands Air Attaché with regard to the equipping of Ocean Weather Ships stationed along the North Atlantic route with Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio equipment for Air/Ground communications in the 200-400 megacycles band. Jet aircraft being ferried in Operation High Flight for the Mutual Defense Assistance Program in support of NATO are equipped with only UHF radio equipment. Effective safety precautions for this operation call for availability of the air navigation and search-and-rescue facilities provided by all the Ocean Weather Ships stationed at points along the over-water portion of the flight path. However, since only United States vessels are equipped with UHF radio sets, the aircraft are currently unable to communicate with the Ocean Weather Ships of other nations. The United States Air Force proposes to eliminate this hazard by lending to the Netherlands Ministry of Defense the R-361 UHF receivers, the T-282 UHF transmitters, and the ancillary items listed on the attached Annex, on the understanding that the Netherlands Ministry will insure the prompt installation of this equipment on the Ocean Weather Ships provided by the Netherlands Government along the cited flight path, and that such equipment will be maintained and operated aboard such vessels by the Netherlands Government on a daily 24-hour receiving and transmitting service available for use by the United States Air Force. Sufficient equipment and maintenance parts to assure 100 % backup capability at all times will be provided by the United States Air Force. The Department of the Air Force is prepared to make this loan to the Netherlands Government on the understanding that this equipment, together with unexpended maintenance parts and ancillary facilities, will be returned to the United States Air Force within six months from the date of receipt of a request for such return. The Department of the Air Force requests that a communication in the above sense be made to the Netherlands Ministry of Defense informing the Ministry that the Department of the Air Force will consider this note and the Embassy's reply thereto as constituting an agreement between the Government of the Netherlands and the Government of the United States. The Department of the Air Force further report that upon completion of the exchange of notes referred to above representatives of the Department of the Air Force and the Netherlands Air Attaché will undertake to make such further arrangements as may be necessary to implement the agreement.
