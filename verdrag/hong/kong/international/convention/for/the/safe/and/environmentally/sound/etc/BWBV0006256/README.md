2.  When the Organization receives a proposal, it shall also bring the proposal to the attention of the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, intergovernmental organizations having agreements with the Organization and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Organization and shall make it available to them.   
3.  The Committee shall establish a technical group in accordance with regulation 7 to review proposals submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 of this regulation.   
4.  The technical group shall review the proposal along with any additional data, including decisions adopted by other international bodies regarding their lists of materials or hazardous substances, submitted by any interested entity, and shall evaluate and report to the Committee whether the Hazardous Material in question is likely, in the context of this Convention, to lead to significant adverse effects on human health or the environment such that the amendment of Appendix 1 or Appendix 2 is warranted. In this regard: 

.1. The technical group’s review shall include: 

.1.1. an evaluation of the association between the Hazardous Material in question and the likelihood, in the context of this Convention, that it will lead to significant adverse effects on human health or the environment based on the submitted data or other relevant data brought to the attention of the group;  

.1.2. an evaluation of the potential risk reduction attributable to the proposed control measures and any other control measures that may be considered by the technical group;  

.1.3. consideration of available information on the technical feasibility of control measures;  

.1.4. consideration of available information on other effects arising from the introduction of such control measures relating to: 

– the environment;  

– human health and safety including that of seafarers and workers; and  

– the cost to international shipping and other relevant sectors.    

.1.5. consideration of the availability of suitable alternatives to the Hazardous Material to be controlled, including a consideration of the potential risks of alternatives;  

.1.6. consideration of the risks posed by the Hazardous Material during the recycling process; and
