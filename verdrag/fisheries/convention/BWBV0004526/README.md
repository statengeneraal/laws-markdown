##Verdrag inzake de visserij

####Fisheries Convention

The Governments of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Desiring to define a regime of fisheries of a permanent character;   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

(1).  Each Contracting Party recognizes the right of any other Contracting Party to establish the fishery regime described in Articles 2 to 6 of the present Convention.   
(2).  Each Contracting Party retains however the right to maintain the fishery regime which it applies at the date on which the present Convention is opened for signature, if this regime is more favourable to the fishing of other countries than the regime described in Articles 2 to 6.   

### Article  2  

The coastal State has the exclusive right to fish and exclusive jurisdiction in matters of fisheries within the belt of six miles measured from the baseline of its territorial sea.  

### Article  3  

Within the belt between six and twelve miles measured from the baseline of the territorial sea, the right to fish shall be exercised only by the coastal State and by such other Contracting Parties, the fishing vessels of which have habitually fished in that belt between 1st January, 1953 and 31st December, 1962.  

### Article  4  

Fishing vessels of the Contracting Parties, other than the coastal State, permitted to fish under Article 3, shall not direct their fishing effort towards stocks of fish or fishing grounds substantially different from those which they have habitually exploited. The coastal State may enforce this rule.  

### Article  5  

(1).  Within the belt mentioned in Article 3 the coastal State has the power to regulate the fisheries and to enforce such regulations, including regulations to give effect to internationally agreed measures of conservation, provided that there shall be no discrimination in form or in fact against fishing vessels of other Contracting Parties fishing in conformity with Articles 3 and 4.   
(2).  Before issuing regulations, the coastal State shall inform the other Contracting Parties concerned and consult those Contracting Parties, if they so wish.   

### Article  6  

Any straight baseline or bay closing line which a Contracting Party may draw shall be in accordance with the rules of general international law and in particular with the provisions of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone opened for signature at Geneva on 29th April, 1958.  

### Article  7  

Where the coasts of two Contracting Parties are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of these Contracting Parties is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to establish a fisheries régime beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the low water lines of the coasts of the Contracting Parties concerned.  

### Article  8  

(1).  Once a Contracting Party applies the régime described in Articles 2 to 6, any right to fish which it may thereafter grant to a State not a Contracting Party shall extend automatically to the other Contracting Parties, whether or not they could claim this right by virtue of habitual fishing, to the extent that the State not a Contracting Party avails itself effectively and habitually of that right.   
(2).  If a Contracting Party which has established the régime described in Articles 2 tot 6 should grant to another Contracting Party any right to fish which the latter cannot claim under Articles 3 and 4, the same right shall extend automatically to all other Contracting Parties.   

### Article  9  

(1).  In order to allow fishermen of other Contracting Parties, who have habitually fished in the belt provided for in Article 2 to adapt themselves to their exclusion from that belt, a Contracting Party which establishes the régime provided for in Articles 2 to 6, shall grant to such fishermen the right to fish in that belt for a transitional period, to be determined by agreement between the Contracting Parties concerned.   
(2).  If a Contracting Party establishes the régime described in Articles 2 to 6, it may, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, continue to accord the right to fish in the whole or part of the belt provided for in Article 2 to other Contracting Parties of which the fishermen have habitually fished in the area by reason of voisinage arrangements.   

### Article  10  

Nothing in the present Convention shall prevent the maintenance or establishment of a special régime in matters of fisheries: 

(a) as between States Members and Associated States of the European Economic Community,  

(b) as between States Members of the Benelux Economic Union,  

(c) as between Denmark, Norway and Sweden,  

(d) as between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in respect of Granville Bay and the Minquiers and the Ecrehos,  

(e) as between Spain, Portugal and their respective neighbouring countries in Africa,  

(f) in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat.    

### Article  11  

Subject to the approval of the other Contracting Parties, a coastal State may exclude particular areas from the full application of Articles 3 and 4 in order to give preference to the local population if it is overwhelmingly dependent upon coastal fisheries.  

### Article  12  

The present Convention applies to the waters adjacent to the coasts of the Contracting Parties listed in Annex I. This Annex may be amended with the consent of the Governments of the Contracting Parties. Any proposal for amendment shall be sent to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which shall notify it to all Contracting Parties, and inform them of the date on which it enters into force.  

### Article  13  

Unless the parties agree to seek a solution by another method of peaceful settlement, any dispute which may arise between Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Convention shall at the request of any of the parties be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Annex II to the present Convention.

In either case the Convention shall enter into force with respect to any Government that ratifies or approves thereafter on the date of deposit of its instrument of ratification or approval.

### Annex  1  

####European Fisheries Conference

###RESOLUTION ON FISHERIES POLICING

### *Adopted on 17th January, 1964* 

THE CONFERENCE REQUESTS the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland To invite the Governments of all countries participating in the North-East Atlantic fisheries to send representatives to a technical conference to be held as soon as possible to prepare for the consideration of the Governments concerned a draft Convention, on the general lines of the 1882 Convention for regulating the police of the North Sea Fisheries, embodying a modern code for the conduct of fishing operations and of related activities in the North-East Atlantic; And to invite the Governments of the United States of America and Canada to send representatives to the Conference so that the extension of the provisions of any such Convention to the North-West Atlantic Fisheries may be considered.   

### Annex  2  

####European Fisheries Conference

###RESOLUTION ON CONSERVATION

### *Adopted on 17th January, 1964* 

Recognising that all efforts to promote the stability and prosperity of the fishing industry ultimately depend on effective conservation measures to ensure the rational exploitation of the resources of the sea, and that the Commission recently established under the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention is the body internationally responsible for these matters, THE CONFERENCE urges the Governments represented on the Commission to intensify their efforts To secure the introduction of such measures as may be necessary, not only to prevent over-fishing, but to ensure the profitable exploitation of the fisheries for the benefit of all the countries concerned; And for this purpose to ensure that the Commission is enabled to employ the full range of measures envisaged in the Convention, including measures of national and international control to ensure the effective observance of the regulations.   

### Annex  3  

####European Fisheries Conference

###RESOLUTION ON ACCESS TO MARKETS

### *Adopted on 29th February, 1964* 

Considering that trade in fish and fish products play an important role for many European countries, Recognising that the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (O.E.E.C.) in its report of 1960 on Fishery Policies in Western Europe and North America has in particular established a set of principles in order to bring about more liberal conditions for trade in fish and fish products, Noting that conditions are still prevailing which hamper a sound development of trade in fish and fish products, THE CONFERENCE urges all Governments represented to frame their policies with regard to fisheries in such a manner as to safeguard *inter alia* the interests of countries concerned with the development of trade in fish and fish products along the lines envisaged in the O.E.E.C. Report.   

####Verdrag inzake de visserij

De Regeringen van Oostenrijk, België, Denemarken, Frankrijk, de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, Ierland, Italië, Luxemburg, Nederland, Portugal, Spanje, Zweden en het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland, Geleid door de wens, een duurzaam visserijregime in te stellen,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij erkent het recht van elk der andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 van dit Verdrag omschreven visserijregime in te stellen.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij behoudt echter het recht, het regime dat op de datum waarop dit Verdrag voor ondertekening is opengesteld door haar wordt toegepast te blijven toepassen indien dat regime voor de visserij van andere landen gunstiger is dan het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 omschreven regime.   

### Artikel  2  

De kuststaat heeft, binnen een zone van zes mijl, gemeten van de basislijn van zijn territoriale zee, de uitsluitende visrechten en de uitsluitende rechtsbevoegdheid ten aanzien van visserij aangelegenheden.  

### Artikel  3  

Binnen de zone tussen zes en twaalf mijl, gemeten van de basislijn van de territoriale zee, worden de visrechten alleen uitgeoefend door de kuststaat en door die andere Verdragsluitende Partijen die in de periode tussen 1 januari 1953 en 31 december 1962 gewoon zijn geweest, de visserij in die zone uit te oefenen.  

### Artikel  4  

Vissersschepen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen dan de kuststaat die krachtens de bepalingen van artikel 3 de visserij mogen uitoefenen, mogen deze niet bedrijven op visstapels of op visgronden die aanzienlijk afwijken van die waarop zij gewoon zijn geweest de visserij uit te oefenen. De kuststaat kan de naleving van deze regel afdwingen.  

### Artikel  5  

1.  Binnen de in artikel 3 genoemde zone is de kuststaat bevoegd de visserij te regelen en naleving van deze regeling, met inbegrip van regelingen ter uitvoering van internationale maatregelen tot instandhouding van de visstand, af te dwingen, met dien verstande dat er noch formeel, noch in feite wordt gediscrimineerd ten aanzien van vissersschepen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen die de visserij uitoefenen overeenkomstig de artikelen 3 en 4.   
2.  Alvorens regelingen te treffen, doet de kuststaat daarvan mededeling aan de andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen en pleegt met hen overleg indien zij dit wensen.   

### Artikel  6  

Iedere door een Verdragsluitende Partij te trekken rechte basislijn of afsluitingslijn van een baai dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de regelen van het algemeen volkenrecht en in het bijzonder met de bepalingen van het Verdrag inzake de territoriale zee en de aansluitende zone, dat op 29 april 1958 te Genève voor ondertekening werd opengesteld.  

### Artikel  7  

In gevallen waarin de kusten van twee Verdragsluitende Partijen tegenover elkaar zijn gelegen of aan elkaar grenzen, is, indien er geen overeenkomst tussen hen bestaat, waarin anders wordt bepaald, geen van beide Partijen gerechtigd een regime in te stellen voor de visserij voorbij de middellijn waarvan elk punt even ver is verwijderd van de dichtstbijgelegen punten van de laagwaterlijnen van de kusten van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  Zodra een Verdragsluitende Partij het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 omschreven regime toepast, gelden alle visrechten die zij daarna toekent aan een Staat die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag automatisch voor de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen in het betrokken gebied, ongeacht of deze daarop aanspraak zouden kunnen maken wegens het feit dat zij de visserij gewoonlijk bedrijven en wel in zoverre de Staat die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag daadwerkelijk en geregeld van die rechten gebruik maakt.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij die het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 omschreven regime heeft ingesteld, aan een andere Verdragsluitende Partij visrechten toekent, waarop laatstgenoemde krachtens de artikelen 3 en 4 geen aanspraak kan maken, gelden deze rechten automatisch voor alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Ten einde vissers van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen die gewoon zijn geweest te vissen in de in artikel 2 bedoelde zone, in de gelegenheid te stellen zich aan te passen aan hun uitsluiting uit deze zone, verleent een Verdragsluitende Partij die het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 bedoelde regime heeft ingesteld, aan deze vissers het recht in die zone gedurende een overgangsperiode te vissen, waarvan de duur in overeenstemming tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt vastgesteld.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij het in de artikelen 2 tot en met 6 bedoelde regime instelt, mag zij, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, visrechten voor de gehele of voor een deel van de in artikel 2 bedoelde zone blijven verlenen aan andere Verdragsluitende Partijen wier vissers gewoon zijn geweest in dat gebied te vissen krachtens „voisinage”-regelingen.   

### Artikel  10  

Niets in dit Verdrag verhindert de instandhouding of instelling van een speciaal regime inzake de visserij tussen: 

(a) Staten die lid zijn van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap of daarmede zijn geassocieerd,  

(b) Staten die lid zijn van de Benelux-Economische Unie,  

(c) Denemarken, Noorwegen en Zweden,  

(d) Frankrijk en het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland met betrekking tot Granville-baai, de Minquiers-eilanden en Ecrehous,  

(e) Spanje en Portugal en hun onderscheiden buurlanden in Afrika alsmede  

(f) in het Skagerrak en Kattegat.    

### Artikel  11  

Onder voorbehoud van goedkeuring door de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen kan een kuststaat bepaalde gebieden van de volledige toepassing van de artikelen 3 en 4 uitsluiten ten behoeve van de plaatselijke bevolking indien deze voor een zeer aanzienlijk deel afhankelijk is van de kustvisserij.  

### Artikel  12  

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op de wateren die grenzen aan de kusten van de in Bijlage I vermelde Verdragsluitende Partijen. Deze Bijlage kan met toestemming van de Regeringen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen worden gewijzigd. Elk wijzigingsvoorstel wordt aan de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland toegezonden, die hiervan aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen mededeling zal doen en hen in kennis zal stellen van de datum waarop de wijziging van kracht wordt.  

### Artikel  13  

Tenzij de Partijen overeenkomen dat op een andere wijze van vreedzame regeling naar een oplossing zal worden gezocht, wordt elk geschil dat tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen rijst betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag, op verzoek van een of meer Partijen aan arbitrage onderworpen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage II van dit Verdrag.

De President van het Internationale Gerechtshof raadpleegt van te voren de partijen bij het geschil en kan ook de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie en de President van de Internationale Raad voor het onderzoek van de zee raadplegen.  

### Artikel  5  

De partijen kunnen een bijzondere overeenkomst opstellen, waarin het onderwerp van het geschil en de bijzonderheden van de te volgen procedure worden vastgelegd.  

### Artikel  6  

Bij gebrek aan voldoende bijzonderheden in een bijzondere overeenkomst of in deze Bijlage betreffende de in artikel 5 van deze Bijlage bedoelde kwesties, zijn de bepalingen van de artikelen 59 tot en met 82 van het Verdrag van 's-Gravenhage voor de vreedzame beslechting van internationale geschillen van 18 oktober 1907 voor zover mogelijk van toepassing.  

### Artikel  7  

De partijen vergemakkelijken het werk van het College van Scheidsrechters en verstrekken dit in het bijzonder alle terzake dienende documenten en gegevens. Zij gebruiken de hun ter beschikking staande middelen ten einde dit College in staat te stellen op hun grondgebied en in overeenstemming met hun wettelijke bepalingen over te gaan tot het oproepen en horen van getuigen of deskundigen, alsmede de desbetreffende plaatsen te bezoeken.  

### Artikel  8  

Indien de partijen niet anders zijn overeengekomen, worden de beslissingen van het College van Scheidsrechters met meerderheid van stemmen genomen en met uitzondering van procedurekwesties zijn deze beslissingen alleen geldig indien alle leden aanwezig zijn.

### Artikel  10  

De geldigheid van wettelijke maatregelen die voor de datum waarop het Verdrag ter ondertekening werd opengesteld in werking zijn getreden, mag bij de procedure voor het College van Scheidsrechters niet in twijfel worden getrokken.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  In geval het geschil gegrond is op vermoedelijke schade aan particuliere belangen die, volgens het nationale recht van een der partijen, binnen de bevoegdheid valt van haar rechterlijke of bestuurlijke autoriteiten, kan de desbetreffende partij er bezwaar tegen maken dat het geschil ter regeling wordt voorgelegd door middel van de in deze Bijlage aangegeven procedure voordat door de bevoegde autoriteit binnen een redelijke termijn een definitieve beslissing is genomen.   
2.  Indien in de betrokken Staat een definitieve beslissing is genomen, zal het niet meer mogelijk zijn van de in deze Bijlage aangegeven procedure gebruik te maken na afloop van een termijn van vijf jaar te rekenen van de datum van bovengenoemde uitspraak af.   

### Artikel  12  

Indien de tenuitvoerlegging van een uitspraak van het College van Scheidsrechters strijdig is met een door een rechtbank of andere autoriteit van een der partijen bij het geschil gewezen vonnis of bevolen maatregel en indien het nationale recht van die partij niet toestaat of slechts ten dele toestaat dat de gevolgen van dat vonnis of die maatregel worden tenietgedaan, verleent het College van Scheidsrechters de partij die schade heeft geleden billijke genoegdoening indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  In alle gevallen waarin een geschil het onderwerp vormt van arbitrage, en in het bijzonder indien de kwestie waarover de partijen het oneens zijn voortvloeit uit reeds verrichte handelingen of uit handelingen die op het punt staan te worden verricht, stelt het College van Scheidsrechters binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd de voorlopige maatregelen die dienen te worden genomen, vast. De partijen bij het geschil moeten zich aan deze maatregelen houden.   
2.  De partijen onthouden zich van alle maatregelen die de tenuitvoerlegging van de uitspraak van het College van Scheidsrechters ongunstig zouden kunnen beïnvloeden en onthouden zich in het algemeen van elke handelwijze die het geschil kan verergeren of een grotere omvang kan doen aannemen.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Zodra het College van Scheidsrechters is gevormd, stelt de Voorzitter de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen van het aan dit College voorgelegde geschil in kennis.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan binnen een maand van de datum van ontvangst van deze kennisgeving tussenbeide komen, indien zij kan aantonen dat zij een rechtmatig belang heeft bij de regeling van het geschil. Deze tussenkomst mag uitsluitend tot doel hebben datgene wat door de oorspronkelijke partijen bij het geschil is aangevoerd, of een gedeelte daarvan, te staven of te betwisten. Tussenkomst mag niet leiden tot een wijziging in de oorspronkelijke samenstelling van het College van Scheidsrechters.   

### Artikel  15  

Elk der Verdragsluitende Partijen moet zich houden aan de uitspraak van het College van Scheidsrechters in elk geschil waarbij zij partij is.
