2.  Each Contracting Party may request consultations concerning the safety standards and requirements maintained and administered by the other Contracting Party relating to aeronautical facilities, aircrew, aircraft, and operation of the designated airlines. If, following such consultations, either Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards ans requirements in these areas that are equal to or above the minimum standards which may be established pursuant to the Convention, they will notify the other Contracting Party of such findings and the steps considered necessary to bring the safety standards and requirements of the other Contracting Party to standards at least equal to the minimum standards which may be established pursuant to the Convention, and the other Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Each Contracting Party reserves the right to withhold, revoke or limit the operating authorization or technical permission of an airline or airlines designated by the other Contracting Party in the event the other Contracting Party does not take such appropriate action within a reasonable time.   

### Article  7  

In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, both contracting parties agree that: 

1. User charges that may be imposed by the competent charging authorities or bodies of one Contracting Party on the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party shall be just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. In any event, any such charge shall be assessed on the airlines of the other Contracting Party on terms not less favorable than the most favorable terms available to any other airline at the time the charges are assessed.  

2. User charges imposed on the airlines of the other Contracting Party may reflect, but shall not exceed, an equitable portion of the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport, air navigation, airport environmental, and aviation security facilities and services, and in the case of airports, may provide for a reasonable rate of return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which charges are made shall be provided on an efficient basis. Reasonable notice shall be given prior to changes in user charges.  

3. Each Contracting Party shall encourage consultations between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and airlines using the services and facilities, and shall encourage the competent charging authorities or bodies and the airlines to exchange such information as may be necessary for an accurate review of the reasonableness of the charges in light of the principles of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article.   

1. On arriving in the territory of one Contracting Party, aircraft operated in international air transportation by the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party, their regular equipment, ground equipment, fuel, lubricants, consumable technical supplies, spare parts (including engines), aircraft stores (including but not limited to such items of food, beverages and liquor, tobacco, and other products destined for sale to or use by passengers in limited quantities during flight) and other items intended for or used solely in connection with the operation or servicing of aircraft engaged in international air transportation shall be exempt, on the basis of reciprocity, from all import restrictions, taxes, levies, duties, and similar fees and charges imposed by the national authorities, and not based on the cost of services; provided such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft.  

2. There shall also be exempt, on the basis of reciprocity, from the taxes, levies, duties, fees and charges referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, with the exception of charges based on the cost of the services provided: 

a) aircraft stores introduced into or supplied in the territory of one Contracting Party and taken on board, within reasonable limits, for use on outbound aircraft of an airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in international air transportation, even when these stores are to be used on a part of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they are taken on board;  

b) ground equipment and spare parts (including engines) introduced into the territory of a Contracting Party for the servicing, maintenance or repair of aircraft of an airline of the other Contracting Party used in international air transportation;  

c) fuel, lubricants and consumable technical supplies introduced into or supplied in the territory of a Contracting Party for use in an aircraft of an airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in international air transportation, even when these supplies are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they are taken on board; and  

d) promotional and advertising materials introduced into or supplied in the territory of one Contracting Party and taken on board, within reasonable limits, for use on outbound aircraft of an airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in international air transportation, even when these stores are to be used on a part of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they are taken on board.  

3. Equipment and supplies referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the appropriate authorities.  

4. The exemptions provided by this Article shall also be available where the designated airlines of one Contracting Party have contracted with another airline, which similarly enjoys such exemptions from the other Contracting Party, for the loan or transfer in the territory of the other Contracting Party of the items specified in paragraph (1) and (2) of this Article.      

### Article  8  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall allow a fair, equal, and nondiscriminatory opportunity for the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties to compete with the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party.   
2.  Neither Contracting Party shall unilaterally limit the volume of traffic, frequency or regularity of service, or the aircraft type or types operated by the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party, except as may be required for customs, technical, operational or environmental reasons under uniform conditions consistent with Article 15 of the Convention.   
3.  Neither Contracting Party shall impose on the other Contracting Party's designated airlines a first refusal requirement, uplift ratio, no-objection fee, or any other requirement with respect to the capacity, frequency or traffic which would be inconsistent with the purposes of this Agreement.   
4.  Neither Contracting Party shall require the filing of schedules, programs for charter flights, or operational plans by airlines of the other Contracting Party for approval, except as may be required on a non-discriminatory basis to enforce uniform conditions as foreseen by paragraph (2) of this Article or as may be specifically authorized in this Agreement. If a Contracting Party requires filings for information purposes, it shall minimize the administrative burdens of filing requirements and procedures on air transportation intermediaries and on designated airlines of the other Contracting Party.   

### Article  9  

In the operation by the airlines of either contracting party of the air services described in this Agreement, the interest of the airlines of the other contracting party shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides on all or part of the same routes.  

### Article  10  

The air services made available to the public by the airlines operating under this Agreement shall bear a close relationship to the requirements of the public for such services.  

### Article  10 bis  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, as amended, airlines of both parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with international air services any surface transport for cargo to or from any points in the territories of the parties or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Airlines may elect to perform their own surface transportation or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transportation operated by other airlines and indirect providers of cargo air transportation. Such intermodal cargo services may be offered at a single through price for the air and surface transportation combined, provided that shippers are not misled as to the facts concerning such transportation.  

### Article  11  

(a) Each Contracting Party shall allow prices for air transportation to be established by each airline of the Contracting Parties based upon commercial considerations in the marketplace. Intervention by the Contracting Parties shall be limited to: 

(1) prevention of unreasonably discriminatory prices orpractices;  

(2) protection of consumers from prices that are unreasonably high or restrictive because of the abuse of a dominant position; and  

(3) protection of airlines from prices that are artificially low because of direct or indirect government subsidy or support.    

(b) Each Contracting Party may require notification to or filing with its aeronautical authorities of prices proposed to be charged to or from its territory by airlines of the other Contracting Party. Notification or filing by the airlines of both Contracting Parties may be required no more than 30 days before the proposed date of effectiveness. In individual cases, notification or filing may be permitted on shorter notice than normally required. Neither Contracting Party shall require the notification or filing by airlines of the other Contracting Party of prices charged by charterers to the public for traffic originating in the territory of either Contracting Party.  

(c) Neither contracting party shall take unilateral action to prevent the inauguration or continuation of a price charged or proposed to be charged by (1) an airline of either contracting party for international air transportation between the territories of the contracting parties, including transportation on an interline or intra-line basis, or (2) an airline of one contracting party for international air transportation between the territory of the other contracting party and a third country, including transportation on an interline or intra-line basis, provided that, in the case of service to or from third countries that are members of the European Communities as of December 1, 1991, such price is not specifically prohibited under the law of the European Communities. Without mutual agreement, such prices shall go into or continue in effect. If either contracting party is dissatisfied with any price, it shall request consultations, and notify the other contracting party of the reasons it believes such price is inconsistent with the considerations set forth in paragraph (A) of this article, as soon as possible. In the case of a proposed price, such notification shall be given no less than 15 days before the proposed effectiveness date. These consultations shall be held not later than 30 days after receipt of the request, and the contracting parties shall cooperate in securing information necessary for reasoned resolution of the issue. If the contracting parties reach agreement with respect to a price for which a notice of dissatisfaction has been given, each contracting party shall use its best efforts to put that agreement into effect.  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, each Contracting Party shall allow any airline of either Contracting Party to meet any price charged in the marketplace for international air transportation, including combinations of prices via points in the territory of one or both Contracting Parties or of a third country. As used herein, the term “meet” means the right to continue or institute, on a timely basis, using such expedited procedures as may be necessary, an identical or similar price or such price through a combination of prices on a direct, interline or intra-line basis, notwithstanding differences in conditions including, but not limited to, those relating to airports, routing, distance, timing, connections, aircraft type, aircraft configuration, or change of aircraft.    

### Article  12  

Consultation between the competent authorities of both contracting parties may be requested at any time by either contracting party for the purpose of discussing the interpretation, application, or amendment of the Agreement or Schedule. Such consultation shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of the receipt of the request by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of The Netherlands or the Department of State of the United States of America as the case may be. Should agreement be reached on amendment of the Agreement or its route schedule, such amendment will come into effect upon the confirmation by an exchange of diplomatic notes.  

### Article  13  

1.  Any dispute arising under this Agreement, other than disputes that may arise under Article 12 (Pricing) , which is not resolved by a first round of formal consultations, may be referred for decision to some person or body. If the Contracting Parties do not agree, the dispute shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth below. <sup> 1)  [Red: Ten rechte dient hier te worden gelezen: Article 11 (Pricing).]  </sup>   
2.  Arbitration shall be by a tribunal of three arbitrators which shall be constituted as follows: 

a) within 30 days after receipt of a request for arbitration, each Contracting Party shall appoint one arbitrator. Within 60 days after these two arbitrators have been named, they shall by agreement appoint a third arbitrator, who shall act as President of the arbitral tribunal;  

b) if either Contracting Party fails to name an arbitrator, or if the third arbitrator is not appointed in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, either Contracting Party may request the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to appoint the necessary arbitrator or arbitrators within 30 days. If the President of the Council is of the same nationality as one of the Contracting Parties, the most senior Vice President who is not disqualified on that ground shall make the appointment.     
3.  Except as otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the limits of its jurisdiction, in accordance with this Agreement, and shall establish its own procedure. The arbitral tribunal, once formed, shall have the jurisdiction to grant interim relief pending its final determination. At the direction of the tribunal or at the request of either of the Contracting Parties, a conference to determine the precise issues to be arbitrated and the specific procedures to be followed shall be held no later than 15 days after the tribunal is fully constituted.   
4.  Except as otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties or directed by the tribunal, each Contracting Party shall submit a memorandum within 45 days after the tribunal is fully constituted. Replies shall be due 60 days later. The tribunal shall hold a hearing at the request of either Contracting party, or at its discretion, within 15 days after replies are due.   
5.  The tribunal shall attempt to render a written decision within 30 days after completion of the hearing or, if no hearing is held, after the date both replies are submitted, whichever is sooner. The decision of the majority of the tribunal shall prevail.   
6.  The Contracting Parties may submit requests for clarification of the decision within 15 days after it is rendered and any clarification given shall be issued within 15 days of such request.   
7.  Each Contracting Party shall, consistent with its national law, give full effect to any decision or award of the arbitral tribunal. In the event that one Contracting Party does not give effect to any decision or award, the other Contracting Party may take such proportionate steps as may be appropriate.   
8.  The expenses of the arbitral tribunal, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, shall be shared equally by the Contracting Parties. Any expenses incurred by the President or Vice-President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization in connection with the procedures in paragraph (2)(b) of this Article shall be considered to be part of the expenses of the arbitral tribunal.   

### Article  14  

This Agreement, all amendments thereto, and contracts connected therewith shall be registered with the International Civil Aviation Organization.  

### Article  15  

If a general multilateral air transport Convention accepted by both contracting parties enters into force, the present Agreement shall be amended so as to conform with the provisions of such Convention.  

### Article  16  

Either of the contracting parties may at any time notify the other of its intention to terminate the present Agreement. Such a notice shall be sent simultaneously to the International Civil Aviation Organization. In the event such communication is made, this Agreement shall terminate two years after the date of its receipt, unless by agreement between the contracting parties the notice of intention to terminate is withdrawn before the expiration of that time. If the other contracting party fails to acknowledge receipt, notice shall be deemed as having been received fourteen days after its receipt by the International Civil Aviation Organization.  

### Article  17  

The present agreement shall be provisionally operative from the date of its signature. After the approval constitutionally required in the Kingdom of The Netherlands has been obtained, the Agreement shall enter into force definitively on the date of receipt by the Government of the United States of America of an appropriate notification from the Government of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.  

In witness whereof, the undersigned, being duly authorized by their respective Governments, have signed the present Agreement. Done in duplicate at Washington, D. C. this 3rd day of April, 1957. For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands: (sd.) E. H. VAN DER BEUGEL For the Government of the United States of America: (sd.) CHRISTIAN A. HERTER

### Nr.  I  

April 3, 1957. Dear Mr. Secretary: On behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands I express my disappointment that, in concluding the airtransport agreement, it has not been possible at the present moment to include the right to operate air services from the Netherlands to Los Angeles and vice versa by an airline designated by the aforesaid Government. I want to convey to you the intention of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to open as soon as possible consultations on the basis of the provisions contained in article 12 of the Agreement in order to include the above mentioned route in the schedule of the Agreement. Please accept, Mr. Secretary, the assurance of my highest consideration. Sincerely yours, (sd.) E. H. VAN DER BEUGEL Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.  *The Honorable*   *John Foster Dulles,*   *Secretary of State,*   *Department of State,*   *Washington, 25, D.C.*    

### Nr.  II  

###DEPARTMENT OF STATE

###WASHINGTON

April 3, 1957. Dear Mr. van der Beugel, The Department has noted the disappointment expressed in your letter of April 3, 1957, at the present inability of the United States to grant traffic rights at Los Angeles to the Dutch airline and has noted your intention of requesting at a future date that the United States grant such rights. As you are aware, the consultation provisions contained in Article 12 of the Agreement are, amongst other things, designed to provide a mechanism by means of which route pattern adjustments may be reviewed on the request of either party to ensure that the Agreement, as far as possible, will be mutually satisfactory. Sincerely yours, (sd.) CHRISTIAN A. HERTER Under Secretary  *His Excellency*   *E. H. van der Beugel,*   *Under Secretary of State for*   *Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.*    

### Annex  

####Principles of Non-Discrimination Within and Competition Among Computer Reservations Systems

The Parties: Recognizing that Article 5 of the 1978 protocol relating to the United States-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement guarantees “a fair opportunity for the designated airlines of both contracting parties to compete...”; considering that one of the most important aspects of the ability of an airline to compete is its ability to inform the public of its services in a fair and impartial manner, and that, therefore, the quality of information about airline services available to travel agents who directly distribute such information to the travelling public and the ability of an airline to offer those agents competitive Computer Reservations Systems (CRSS) represent the foundation for an airline's competitive opportunities; considering that it is equally necessary to ensure that the interests of the consumers of air transport products are protected from any misuse of such information and its misleading presentation and that airlines and travel agents have access to effectively competitive computer reservations systems; have agreed as follows with respect to the agreed international scheduled passenger services under this agreement (“Agreed Services”):    

### 1  

The parties agree with respect to CRSS with integrated primary displays: 

(A) Information regarding international air services, including the construction of connections on those services, shall be edited and displayed based on non-discriminatory and objective criteria that are not to be influenced, directly or indirectly, by airline or market identity. Such criteria shall apply uniformly to all participating airlines.  

(B) CRS data bases shall be as comprehensive as possible.  

(C) CRS vendors shall not delete information submitted by participating airlines; such information shall be accurate and transparent; for example, code-shared and change-of-gauge flights and flights with stops should be clearly identified as having those characteristics.  

(D) All CRSS which are available to travel agents who directly distribute information about airline services to the travelling public in either party's territory shall not only be obliged to, but shall also be entitled to operate in conformance with the CRS rules that apply in the territory where the CRS is being operated.  

(E) Travel agents shall be allowed to use any of the secondary displays available through the CRS so long as the travel agent makes a specific request for that display.    

### 2  

A party shall require that each CRS vendor operating in its territory allow all airlines willing to pay any applicable non-discriminatory fee to participate in its CRS. A party shall require that all distribution facilities which a system vendor provides shall be offered on a non-discriminatory basis to participating airlines. A party shall require that CRS vendors display, on a non-discriminatory, objective, carrier-neutral, and market-neutral basis, the international air services of participating airlines in all markets in which they wish to sell those services. Upon request, a CRS vendor shall disclose details of its data base update and storage procedures, its criteria for editing and ranking information, the weight given to such criteria, and the criteria used for selection of connect points and inclusion of connecting flights.  

### 3  

CRS vendors operating in the territory of one party shall be entitled to bring in, maintain, and make freely available their CRSS to travel agencies or travel companies whose principal business is the distribution of travel-related products in the territory of the other party, if the CRS complies with these principles.  

### 4  

Neither party shall, in its territory, impose or permit to be imposed on the CRS vendors of the other party more stringent requirements with respect to access to and use of communication facilities, selection and use of technical CRS hardware and software, and the technical installation of CRS hardware, than those imposed on its own CRS vendors.  

### 5  

Neither party shall, in its territory, impose or permit to be imposed on the CRS vendors of the other party more restrictive requirements with respect to CRS displays (including edit and display parameters), operation, or sale than those imposed on its own CRS vendors.  

### 6  

CRSS in use in the territory of one party, which comply with these principles and other relevant non-discriminatory regulatory, technical, and security standards, shall be entitled to effective and unimpaired access in the territory of the other party. One aspect of this is that a designated airline shall participate in such a system as fully in its homeland territory as it does in any system offered to travel agents in the territory of the other party. Owners/operators of CRSS of one party shall have the same opportunity to own/operate CRSS, which conform to these principles, within the territory of the other party as do owner/operators of that party. Each party shall ensure that its airlines and its CRS vendors do not discriminate against travel agents in their homeland territory because of their use or possession of a CRS also operated in the territory of the other party.

3.  Geen van de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel wordt geacht de luchtvaartmaatschappij(-en) van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht te verlenen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, passagiers, vracht of post aan boord te nemen die worden vervoerd tegen beloning en zijn bestemd voor een ander punt op het grondgebied van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  3  

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht zoveel luchtvaartmaatschappijen als zij wenst aan te wijzen voor het uitvoeren van internationale luchtdiensten in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en zulke aanwijzingen in te trekken of te wijzigen. Deze aanwijzingen worden aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij schriftelijk langs diplomatieke weg toegezonden en geven aan of de luchtvaartmaatschappij gemachtigd is de in deze Overeenkomst omschreven geregelde luchtdienst of charterluchtdienst dan wel beide te verrichten.   
2.  Na ontvangst van deze aanwijzing en van de aanvragen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, in de voorgeschreven vorm en op de voorgeschreven wijze, van exploitatievergunningen en technische vergunningen, verleent de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zonder onnodige procedurele vertraging de vereiste exploitatievergunningen en technische vergunningen aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(-en), mits de luchtvaartmaatschappij voldoet aan de in deze Overeenkomst vervatte normen en in staat is te voldoen aan de gewoonlijk op de exploitatie van internationale luchtdiensten toegepaste wetten en voorschriften van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de aanvraag of aanvragen beziet.   

### Artikel  4  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor het voorrecht van de uitoefening van de in deze Overeenkomst bepaalde rechten niet te verlenen aan een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, het te schorsen, te beperken, voorwaarden daaraan te verbinden of het in te trekken, ingeval niet te haren genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij onderdanen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, of ingeval die luchtvaartmaatschappij nalaat de in artikel 5 bedoelde wetten of voorschriften na te leven, dan wel ingeval de luchtvaartmaatschappij of de regering die haar aanwijst anderszins in gebreke blijft haar verplichtingen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst na te komen of te voldoen aan de voorwaarden waaronder de rechten worden verleend overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  5  

(A).  De wetten en voorschriften van een overeenkomstsluitende partij betreffende de toelating tot of het vertrek uit haar grondgebied van luchtvaartuigen, gebezigd in internationaal luchtverkeer, of betreffende de exploitatie van en het vliegen met zulke luchtvaartuigen gedurende hun verblijf binnen haar grondgebied, zullen van toepassing zijn op de luchtvaartuigen van de door de andere overeenkomstsluitende partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen en zullen door deze luchtvaartmaatschappijen moeten worden nagekomen bij het binnenkomen in of verlaten van en gedurende het verblijf binnen het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde overeenkomstsluitende partij.   
(B).  De wetten en voorschriften van een overeenkomstsluitende partij betreffende de toelating tot of het vertrek uit haar grondgebied van passagiers, bemanningen of vracht van luchtvaartuigen, zoals voorschriften betreffende binnenkomst, in- en uitklaring, immigratie, paspoorten, douane en quarantaine, zullen door of vanwege deze passagiers, bemanning of vracht van de andere overeenkomstsluitende partij bij het binnenkomen in of vertrek uit en gedurende het verblijf binnen het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde overeenkomstsluitende partij moeten worden nagekomen.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid en bewijzen van bevoegdheid, welke zijn uitgereikt of geldig verklaard door een overeenkomstsluitende partij en welke nog van kracht zijn, zullen door de andere overeenkomstsluitende partij als geldig worden erkend voor de exploitatie van de in deze Overeenkomst vermelde routes en diensten, mits de eisen op grond waarvan deze bewijzen werden uitgereikt of geldig verklaard gelijk zijn aan of hoger zijn dan de minimum-normen, welke krachtens het Verdrag inzake de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart kunnen worden gesteld. Elke overeenkomstsluitende partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor, de erkenning van bewijzen van bevoegdheid, door een andere Staat aan haar eigen onderdanen uitgereikt, te weigeren voor vluchten boven haar eigen grondgebied.   
2.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan verzoeken om overleg betreffende de veiligheidsnormen en -vereisten die worden aangehouden en gehanteerd door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij betreffende luchtvaartvoorzieningen, vliegtuigbemanning, luchtvaartuigen en de exploitatie van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen na zulk overleg tot de conclusie komt dat de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de veiligheidsnormen en -vereisten op deze terreinen die gelijk zijn aan of liggen boven de minimumnormen die ingevolge het Verdrag kunnen worden gesteld, niet daadwerkelijk aanhoudt en hanteert, zal zij de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in kennis stellen van deze conclusie en van de stappen die noodzakelijk worden geacht om de veiligheidsnormen en -vereisten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op een niveau te brengen dat ten minste gelijk is aan de minimumnormen die ingevolge het Verdrag kunnen worden gesteld, en neemt de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij passende corrigerende maatregelen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor de exploitatievergunning of technische vergunning van een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij of luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet te verlenen, in te trekken of te beperken ingeval de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij deze passende maatregelen niet binnen een redelijke tijd treft.   

### Artikel  7  

Teneinde bevoorrechtende praktijken te voorkomen en gelijkheid van behandeling te verzekeren komen beide overeenkomstsluitende partijen overeen, dat: 

1. Gebruiksvergoedingen die door de daartoe bevoegde autoriteiten of organen van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening kunnen worden gebracht aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dienen billijk, redelijk, en non-discriminatoir te zijn en naar billijkheid te worden verdeeld over de categorieën gebruikers. In elk geval worden deze gebruiksvergoedingen aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening gebracht op voorwaarden die niet minder gunstig zijn dan de gunstigste voorwaarden die gelden voor andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen op het tijdstip waarop de vergoedingen in rekening worden gebracht.  

2. Aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening gebrachte verbruiksvergoedingen kunnen een weerspiegeling zijn van, doch mogen niet meer bedragen dan, een billijk gedeelte van de volledige kosten van de daartoe bevoegde autoriteiten of organen voor het verschaffen van de desbetreffende luchthaven-, luchtnavigatie-, luchthavenmilieutechnische en de veiligheid van de luchtvaart betreffende voorzieningen en diensten en kunnen in het geval van luchthavens een redelijk rendement omvatten van de activa, na afschrijving. De voorzieningen en diensten waarvoor vergoedingen in rekening worden gebracht worden efficiënt verschaft. Van veranderingen in gebruiksheffingen dient op redelijke termijn voorafgaande kennisgeving te worden gedaan.  

3. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bevordert het overleg tussen de autoriteiten of organen op haar grondgebied die bevoegd zijn kosten in rekening te brengen en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen die van de diensten en voorzieningen gebruik maken, en bevordert dat de autoriteiten of organen die bevoegd zijn kosten in rekening te brengen en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen de gegevens uitwisselen die nodig kunnen zijn voor een nauwkeurige toetsing van de redelijkheid van de kosten in het licht van de beginselen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel.   

1. Bij aankomst op het grondgebied van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zijn door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in internationaal luchtvervoer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen, hun normale uitrustingsstukken, gronduitrusting, brandstof, smeermiddelen, verbruikbare technische voorraden, reserve-onderdelen (met inbegrip van motoren), proviand (met inbegrip van doch niet beperkt tot levensmiddelen, dranken en sterke drank, tabak en andere produkten bestemd om in beperkte hoeveelheden tijdens de vlucht aan de passagiers te worden verkocht of door dezen te worden gebruikt) en andere artikelen die uitsluitend worden gebruikt of bestemd zijn voor gebruik in verband met de exploitatie of het onderhoud van in internationaal luchtvervoer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen, op basis van wederkerigheid, vrijgesteld van alle invoerbeperkingen, belastingen, heffingen, rechten en soortgelijke vergoedingen en kosten die door de nationale autoriteiten worden opgelegd en niet zijn gebaseerd op de kosten van de diensten, mits zulke uitrustingsstukken en voorraden aan boord van het vliegtuig blijven.  

2. Eveneens zijn op basis van wederkerigheid vrijgesteld van de belastingen, heffingen, rechten, vergoedingen en lasten bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, met uitzondering van kosten gebaseerd op de kosten van de verleende dienst: 

a. proviand ingevoerd in of geleverd op het grondgebied van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en aan boord genomen, binnen redelijke grenzen, voor gebruik in de vertrekkende in internationaal luchtvervoer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen van een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zelfs wanneer deze voorraden worden gebruikt op een deel van de reis boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord worden genomen;  

b. gronduitrusting en reserve-onderdelen (met inbegrip van motoren) ingevoerd in het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor de dienstverlening aan het luchtvaartuig, het onderhoud of het herstel van in internationaal luchtvervoer gebruikte luchtvaartuigen van een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

c. brandstof, smeermiddelen en verbruikbare technische voorraden ingevoerd in of geleverd op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor gebruik aan boord van een in internationaal luchtvervoer geëxploiteerd luchtvaartuig van een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zelfs wanneer deze voorraden worden gebruikt op een deel van de reis boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord worden genomen; en  

d. verkoopbevorderend en reclamemateriaal ingevoerd in of geleverd op het grondgebied van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en binnen redelijke grenzen aan boord genomen voor gebruik in internationaal luchtvervoer geëxploiteerde vertrekkende luchtvaartuigen van een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zelfs wanneer deze voorraden worden gebruikt op een deel van de reis boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waar zij aan boord worden genomen.    

3. Er kan worden verlangd dat de in het eerste en het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde uitrustingsstukken en voorraden onder toezicht of controle van de bevoegde autoriteiten worden gehouden.  

4. De in dit artikel bepaalde vrijstellingen gelden ook wanneer de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een contract hebben gesloten met een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij die eveneens zodanige vrijstellingen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geniet, betreffende het lenen of overbrengen naar het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van de in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde goederen.    

### Artikel  8  

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stelt de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op eerlijke, gelijke en non-discriminatoire wijze in de gelegenheid tot concurrentie met de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
2.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen beperkt eenzijdig de omvang van het verkeer, de frequentie of de regelmaat van de dienst, dan wel het type of de typen luchtvaartuig(en) geëxploiteerd door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, behalve voor zover noodzakelijk is om redenen van douanetechnische, technische, operationele of milieutechnische aard, onder eenvormige voorwaarden die in overeenstemming zijn met artikel 15 van het Verdrag.   
3.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen legt aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een verplichting tot eerste weigering, een proportionele beperking (,uplift ratio’), een heffing voor verklaring van geen bezwaar of enige andere eis op met betrekking tot de capaciteit, de frequentie of het vervoer die onverenigbaar zou zijn met de doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlangt dat luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dienstregelingen, programma's voor charterluchtdiensten, of vluchtuitvoeringsplannen ter goedkeuring aan haar voorleggen, behalve voor zover vereist op non-discriminatoire basis, om eenvormige voorwaarden te handhaven als voorzien in het tweede lid van dit artikel, of als specifiek in deze Overeenkomst toegestaan. Indien een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij indiening van gegevens ter informatie verlangt, beperkt zij de administratieve last van de vereisten en procedures betreffende indiening voor tussenpersonen in het luchtvervoer en voor de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tot een minimum.   

### Artikel  9  

Bij de exploitatie door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van elk der overeenkomstsluitende partijen van de in deze Overeenkomst omschreven luchtdiensten zal rekening gehouden worden met het belang van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere overeenkomstsluitende partij, opdat de diensten, welke laatstbedoelde partij op het geheel of een gedeelte van dezelfde routes verschaft, niet onredelijk worden getroffen.  

### Artikel  10  

De luchtdiensten, welke door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen op grond van deze Overeenkomst ter beschikking van het publiek worden gesteld, zullen nauw verband moeten houden met de behoeften van het publiek aan zodanige diensten.  

### Artikel  10-bis  

Onverminderd andere bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, zoals gewijzigd, is het luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Partijen zonder beperking toegestaan in samenhang met internationale luchtdiensten alle vormen van grondvervoer voor vracht te gebruiken van of naar punten op de grondgebieden van de Partijen of derde landen, met inbegrip van vervoer van of naar alle luchthavens met douanefaciliteiten, alsmede met inbegrip, indien van toepassing, van het recht vracht onder douanetoezicht te vervoeren krachtens de van toepassing zijnde wetten en voorschriften. Die vracht heeft, ongeacht of deze per grond- of luchtvervoer wordt verplaatst, toegang tot de douanebehandeling en -voorzieningen op de luchthaven. Luchtvaartmaatschappijen kunnen verkiezen hun eigen grondvervoer te verrichten, dan wel hierin te voorzien door middel van regelingen met andere grondvervoermaatschappijen, met inbegrip van grondvervoer verricht door andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen en maatschappijen die indirect luchtvrachtvervoer verzorgen. Deze diensten van gecombineerd vrachtvervoer mogen worden aangeboden tegen één totaalprijs voor het lucht- en grondvervoer te zamen, mits verzenders niet worden misleid met betrekking tot de feiten aangaande dat vervoer.  

### Artikel  11  

(a) Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij staat iedere luchtvaartmaatschappij van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toe de prijzen voor het luchtvervoer vast te stellen op de grondslag van aan de markt ontleende commerciële overwegingen. De tussenkomst van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dient zich te beperken tot: 

(1) het voorkomen van onredelijk discriminatoire prijzen of praktijken;  

(2) het beschermen van de consumenten tegen prijzen die onredelijk hoog zijn of aan onredelijke beperkingen zijn onderworpen door misbruik van een machtspositie; en  

(3) het beschermen van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen tegen prijzen die kunstmatig laag zijn als gevolg van directe of indirecte overheidssubsidie of -steun.    

(b) Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan verlangen dat bij haar luchtvaartautoriteiten de prijzen worden aangemeld of ingediend die door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden voorgesteld voor het luchtvervoer naar en vanuit haar grondgebied. Aanmelding of indiening door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan worden verlangd ten hoogste 30 dagen vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding. In afzonderlijke gevallen is aanmelding of indiening toegestaan op kortere termijn dan gewoonlijk wordt verlangd. Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlangt de aanmelding of indiening door de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van de prijzen die door charteraars aan het publiek in rekening worden gebracht voor luchtvervoer dat begint op het grondgebied van een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.  

(c) Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen neemt eenzijdige maatregelen ter voorkoming van de invoering of handhaving van een prijs die in rekening wordt gebracht of wordt voorgesteld om in rekening te brengen door (1) een luchtvaartmaatschappij van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen voor internationaal luchtvervoer tussen de grondgebieden van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, met inbegrip van vervoer met onderlinge overdraagbaarheid (interline of intra-line) of (2) een luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor internationaal luchtvervoer tussen het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en een derde land, met inbegrip van vervoer met onderlinge overdraagbaarheid (interline of Intra-line), mits, in geval van diensten van of naar derde landen die op 1 december 1991 lidstaat zijn van de Europese Gemeenschappen, die prijs niet in het bijzonder verboden is krachtens de wetgeving van de Europese Gemeenschappen. Zonder onderlinge overeenstemming worden of blijven die prijzen van kracht. Indien één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ontevreden is met een prijs, verzoekt zij om overleg en stelt zij de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis van de redenen waarom zij meent dat die prijs onverenigbaar is met de overwegingen als vervat in letter A van dit artikel. In geval van een voorgestelde prijs, wordt bedoelde kennisgeving ten minste 15 dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van vankrachtwording gedaan. Dit overleg wordt uiterlijk 30 dagen na de ontvangst van het verzoek gehouden en de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlenen medewerking ter verschaffing van de informatie die nodig is voor een weloverwogen oplossing van het vraagstuk. Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeenstemming bereiken met betrekking tot de prijs ten aanzien waarvan een kennisgeving van ontevredenheid is gedaan, stelt elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij alles in het werk om uitvoering te geven aan die overeenstemming.  

(d) Niettegenstaande enige andere bepaling in dit artikel staat elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan elke luchtvaartmaatschapij van een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toe prijzen te bieden als op de markt in rekening wordt gebracht voor het internationale luchtvervoer, met inbegrip van prijscombinaties via punten in het gebied van een of beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of van een derde land. Onder de hier gebruikte term „bieden” wordt verstaan het recht tot invoering binnen een redelijke termijn en voor zover nodig met behulp van versnelde procedures, van eenzelfde of soortgelijke prijs of van een zodanige prijs via een combinatie van prijzen, gebaseerd op een rechtstreekse vlucht, op vluchten van verschillende luchtvaartmaatschappijen of op verschillende vluchten van één luchtvaartmaatschappij niettegenstaande verschillen in voorwaarden en met inbegrip van, doch niet beperkt tot, die met betrekking tot routering, afstand, tijdstip, verbindingen, type luchtvaartuig en configuratie van het luchtvaartuig of veranderingen van luchtvaartuig.    

### Artikel  12  

Door elk van beide overeenkomstsluitende partijen kan te allen tijde overleg tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide overeenkomstsluitende partijen verzocht worden teneinde besprekingen te voeren omtrent de uitleg, toepassing, of wijziging van de Overeenkomst of van de Tabel. Zodanig overleg zal aanvangen binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen vanaf de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek door het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden dan wel door het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, al naar het geval zich voordoet. Wordt overeenstemming omtrent wijziging van de Overeenkomst of haar routetabel bereikt, dan zal zodanige wijziging van kracht worden na bevestiging door middel van een diplomatieke notawisseling.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  Geschillen met betrekking tot deze Overeenkomst, die geen geschillen zijn betreffende artikel 11 (Prijsstelling), die niet zijn opgelost in een eerste ronde van officieel overleg, kunnen ter beslissing aan een persoon of instantie worden voorgelegd. Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen niet tot overeenstemming komen wordt het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen onderworpen aan arbitrage in overeenstemming met de in het onderstaande uiteengezette procedures.   
2.  Arbitrage geschiedt door een scheidsgerecht van drie scheidsmannen dat als volgt wordt samengesteld: 

a. binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van een verzoek om arbitrage benoemt elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij één scheidsman. Binnen 60 dagen nadat deze twee scheidsmannen zijn benoemd, benoemen zij in onderlinge overeenstemming een derde scheidsman, die optreedt als Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht;  

b. indien een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat een scheidsman te benoemen, of indien de derde scheidsman niet is benoemd overeenkomstig letter a van dit lid, kan elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie verzoeken binnen 30 dagen de vereiste scheidsman of scheidsmannen te benoemen. Indien de President van de Raad dezelfde nationaliteit bezit als een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verricht de Vice-President met de hoogste anciënniteit die niet om die reden gediskwalificeerd is, de benoeming.     
3.  Behalve zoals anderszins door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeengekomen, bepaalt het scheidsgerecht de grenzen van zijn jurisdictie, in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en stelt het zijn eigen procedure vast. Wanneer het scheidsgerecht eenmaal is gevormd heeft het de jurisdictie om een voorlopige regeling te treffen in afwachting van zijn definitieve beslissing. Op aanwijzing van het scheidsgerecht of op verzoek van een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt uiterlijk 15 dagen nadat het scheidsgerecht volledig is samengesteld, een conferentie gehouden ter bepaling van de precieze onderwerpen waarop de arbitrage betrekking zal hebben en de specifieke procedures die moeten worden gevolgd.   
4.  Behalve zoals anderszins door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeengekomen of zoals bevolen door het scheidsgerecht, dient elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij binnen 45 dagen nadat het scheidsgerecht volledig is samengesteld een memorandum in. De replieken dienen 60 dagen daarna te worden gegeven. Het scheidsgerecht houdt, op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen of naar eigen goeddunken, een hoorzitting binnen 15 dagen nadat de replieken ingediend moeten zijn.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht streeft ernaar een schriftelijke beslissing te geven binnen 30 dagen na afloop van de hoorzitting of, indien er geen hoorzitting wordt gehouden, na de datum waarop beide replieken zijn ingediend, naar gelang welke van beide tijdstippen het eerst valt. De beslissing van de meerderheid van het scheidsgerecht is doorslaggevend.   
6.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kunnen binnen 15 dagen nadat de beslissing is gegeven verzoeken indienen om verduidelijking ervan en een eventuele verduidelijking wordt verstrekt binnen 15 dagen na dat verzoek.   
7.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geeft, in overeenstemming met haar nationale wetgeving, volledige uitvoering aan elke beslissing of uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht. Ingeval de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen uitvoering aan een beslissing of uitspraak geeft, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij passende evenredige stappen nemen.   
8.  De kosten van het scheidsgerecht, met inbegrip van de vergoedingen en kosten van de scheidsmannen, worden gelijkelijk tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gedeeld. Kosten van de President of de Vice-President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie in verband met de procedures bedoeld in het tweede lid, letter b, van dit artikel worden als deel van de kosten van het scheidsgerecht beschouwd.   

### Artikel  14  

Deze Overeenkomst, alle wijzigingen daarvan en alle daarmede verband houdende contracten zullen worden geregistreerd bij de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie.  

### Artikel  15  

Indien een door beide overeenkomstsluitende partijen aanvaard algemeen multilateraal verdrag inzake het luchtvervoer van kracht wordt, zal deze Overeenkomst met de bepalingen van zodanig Verdrag in overeenstemming worden gebracht.  

### Artikel  16  

Elk der overeenkomstsluitende partijen kan te allen tijde aan de andere mededeling doen van haar voornemen deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Een zodanige mededeling zal tegelijkertijd worden gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie. Indien een zodanige mededeling wordt gedaan, zal deze Overeenkomst ophouden te bestaan twee jaar na de datum van ontvangst van die mededeling, tenzij in onderling overleg tussen de overeenkomstsluitende partijen de mededeling, waarin de wens om de Overeenkomst te beëindigen is vervat, wordt ingetrokken voordat die termijn is verstreken. Indien de andere overeenkomstsluitende partij nalaat de ontvangst van de mededeling te bevestigen, zal deze geacht worden te zijn ontvangen veertien dagen na de ontvangst daarvan door de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart Organisatie.  

### Artikel  17  

Deze Overeenkomst zal voorlopig toepassing vinden van de datum van ondertekening af. Nadat de in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden vereiste grondwettelijke goedkeuring zal zijn verkregen, zal de Overeenkomst definitief in werking treden op de datum van ontvangst door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika van een desbetreffende mededeling van de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden.  

Ten blijke waarvan de ondergetekenden, daartoe behoorlijk gevolmachtigd door hun onderscheidene Regeringen, deze Overeenkomst hebben ondertekend. Gedaan in tweevoud te Washington, D.C., de derde dag van april 1957. Voor de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden: (w.g.) E. H. VAN DER BEUGEL Voor de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika: (w.g.) CHRISTIAN A. HERTER

3 april 1957. Excellentie, Uit naam van de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden geef ik uiting aan mijn teleurstelling over het feit, dat het bij het sluiten van de luchtvaartovereenkomst op het ogenblik niet mogelijk is geweest daarin op te nemen het recht voor een door genoemde Regering aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, luchtdiensten te exploiteren van Nederland naar Los Angeles en vice versa. Ik wens U op de hoogte te stellen van het voornemen van de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, zo spoedig mogelijk besprekingen te beginnen op grondslag van de in artikel 12 der Overeenkomst vervatte bepalingen, opdat de bovenvermelde route in de Tabel van de Overeenkomst wordt opgenomen. Gelief, Excellentie, de verzekering van mijn zeer bijzondere hoogachting wel te willen aanvaarden. Hoogachtend, (w.g.) E. H. VAN DER BEUGEL Staatssecretaris van Buitenlandse Zaken  *Zijner Excellentie*   *John Foster Dulles,*   *Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken,*   *Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken,*   *Washington, 25, D.C.*

###WASHINGTON

3 april 1957. Hooggeachte Heer van der Beugel, Het Ministerie heeft kennis genomen van de in Uw brief van 3 april 1957 tot uitdrukking gebrachte teleurstelling over het feit, dat de Verenigde Staten op het ogenblik niet in staat zijn verkeersrechten in Los Angeles te verlenen aan de Nederlandse luchtvaartmaatschappij, en heeft kennis genomen van Uw voornemen, op een later tijdstip te verzoeken dat de Verenigde Staten die rechten verlenen. Zoals U weet, is het o.m. de bedoeling van de in artikel 12 van de Overeenkomst vervatte bepalingen omtrent overleg, te voorzien in een procedure door middel waarvan wijzigingen van het routeschema op verzoek van elk der beide partijen in beschouwing kunnen worden genomen, teneinde te verzekeren dat de Overeenkomst zoveel mogelijk voor beide partijen bevredigend zal zijn. Hoogachtend, (w.g.) CHRISTIAN A. HERTER Staatssecretaris  *Zijner Excellentie*   *E. H. van der Beugel,*   *Staatssecretaris van Buitenlandse*   *Zaken van Nederland.*

####Beginselen van non-discriminatie en mededinging tussen geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen

De Partijen, erkennende dat artikel 5 van het Protocol van 1978 met betrekking tot de Luchtvaartovereenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika „de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een eerlijke gelegenheid tot mededinging” waarborgt; overwegende dat één van de belangrijkste aspecten van het concurrentievermogen van een luchtvaartmaatschappij het vermogen is om het publiek op een eerlijke en onpartijdige wijze te informeren over haar diensten en dat de kwaliteit van de informatie over de diensten van luchtvaartmaatschappijen die beschikbaar is voor reisagenten, die deze informatie rechtstreeks verspreiden onder het reizigerspubliek, alsmede het vermogen van een luchtvaartmaatschappij om die agenten concurrerende geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen te bieden, de basis vormen voor de gelegenheid tot mededinging voor een luchtvaartmaatschappij; overwegende dat het eveneens noodzakelijk is te waarborgen dat de belangen van afnemers van luchtvervoerprodukten worden beschermd tegen misbruik van die informatie en de misleidende voorstelling daarvan, en dat luchtvaartmaatschappijen en reisagenten toegang hebben tot daadwerkelijk concurrerende geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen; zijn met betrekking tot de overeengekomen internationale geregelde passagiersdiensten krachtens deze Overeenkomst („de overeengekomen diensten”) het volgende overeengekomen:    

### 1  

De Partijen komen met betrekking tot geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen met geïntegreerde primaire beeldschermen het onderstaande overeen: 

A. Informatie betreffende internationale luchtdiensten, met inbegrip van de vorm van aansluitingen op die diensten, dient te worden opgesteld en weergegeven op basis van non-discriminatoire en objectieve criteria, die niet mogen worden beïnvloed, direct of indirect, door kenmerken die eigen zijn aan de luchtvaartmaatschappij of de markt. Deze criteria gelden op gelijke wijze voor alle deelnemende luchtvaartmaatschappijen.  

B. Gegevensbanken van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen dienen zo veelomvattend mogelijk te zijn.  

C. Aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen mogen geen door deelnemende luchtvaartmaatschappijen verstrekte informatie wissen; die informatie dient exact en begrijpelijk te zijn; bijvoorbeeld vluchten die een gezamenlijke code hebben of waarop van capaciteit wordt veranderd, alsmede vluchten met stops, dienen duidelijk als zodanig herkenbaar te zijn.  

D. Alle geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen die beschikbaar zijn voor reisagenten, die informatie over diensten van luchtvaartmaatschappijen rechtstreeks verspreiden onder het reizigerspubliek op het grondgebied van beide Partijen, zijn niet alleen verplicht, maar ook gerechtigd te handelen in overeenstemming met de regels inzake geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen die van toepassing zijn op het grondgebied waarop het geautomatiseerd boekingssysteem wordt geëxploiteerd.  

E. Het dient reisagenten te worden toegestaan gebruik te maken van via het geautomatiseerd boekingssysteem beschikbare secundaire beeldschermen, zolang de reisagent een daartoe strekkend verzoek doet.    

### 2  

Een Partij verplicht elke op haar grondgebied handelende aanbieder van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen ertoe alle luchtvaartmaatschappijen die bereid zijn een toepasselijke non-discriminatoire vergoeding te betalen, toe te staan deel te nemen aan zijn geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen. Een Partij verlangt dat alle verspreidingsfaciliteiten die een aanbieder van systemen levert, op non-discriminatoire basis aan deelnemende luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden aangeboden. Een Partij verplicht aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen ertoe dat zij de internationale luchtdiensten van deelnemende luchtvaartmaatschappijen op alle markten waarop zij deze diensten wensen te verkopen, weergeven op non-discriminatoire en objectieve wijze, zonder onderscheid naar luchtvervoermaatschappij of markt. Op verzoek maakt een aanbieder van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen bijzonderheden bekend met betrekking tot de wijze van bijwerken en opslaan in zijn gegevensbank, zijn criteria voor het opstellen en rangschikken van de informatie, het gewicht dat aan die criteria wordt toegekend, alsmede de gehanteerde criteria voor de keuze van punten van aansluiting en de vermelding van aansluitende vluchten.  

### 3  

Aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen die handelen op het grondgebied van de ene Partij zijn gerechtigd hun geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen in te voeren, te onderhouden en vrijelijk ter beschikking te stellen aan reisagenten of reisorganisaties waarvan de voornaamste bedrijfsactiviteit bestaat in de verspreiding van met reizen verband houdende produkten op het grondgebied van de andere Partij, indien het geautomatiseerd boekingssysteem aan deze beginselen voldoet.  

### 4  

Geen van beide Partijen legt op haar grondgebied aan de aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen van de andere Partij strengere eisen op met betrekking tot de toegang tot of het gebruik van communicatiefaciliteiten, de keuze en het gebruik van technische apparatuur en programmatuur voor geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen en de technische installatie van apparatuur voor geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen, dan die welke worden opgelegd aan haar eigen aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen, en laat evenmin toe dat deze worden opgelegd.  

### 5  

Geen der Partijen legt op haar grondgebied aan aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen van de andere Partij strengere eisen op met betrekking tot beeldschermen voor geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen (met inbegrip van opmaak- en weergaveparameters), de bediening of de verkoop, dan die welke worden opgelegd aan haar eigen aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen, en laat evenmin toe dat deze worden opgelegd.  

### 6  

Wat betreft geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen die in gebruik zijn op het grondgebied van de ene Partij en die voldoen aan deze beginselen en andere regelgeving ter zake van non-discriminatie, technische voorschriften en veiligheidsnormen, geldt daadwerkelijke en ongehinderde toegang tot het grondgebied van de andere Partij. Een aspect hiervan is dat een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij op dezelfde wijze kan deelnemen aan een dergelijk systeem op het grondgebied van haar eigen land, als aan een systeem dat wordt aangeboden aan reisagenten op het grondgebied van de andere Partij. Eigenaars/exploitanten van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen van de ene Partij hebben dezelfde gelegenheid om eigenaar/exploitant te worden van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen die voldoen aan deze beginselen, op het grondgebied van de andere Partij als de eigenaars/exploitanten van die Partij. Elke Partij ziet erop toe dat haar luchtvaartmaatschappijen en haar aanbieders van geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen niet discrimineren ten aanzien van reisagenten op het grondgebied van hun eigen land vanwege het gebruik of bezit van een geautomatiseerd boekingssysteem dat ook wordt geëxploiteerd op het grondgebied van de andere Partij.
