### Artikel  9  

####Tarieven

1.  De tarieven die door de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden geheven voor het vervoer naar of van het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, worden op een redelijk niveau vastgesteld, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren, daaronder begrepen de exploitatiekosten, een redelijke winst, en de tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde tarieven worden, te zamen met de voor agentenprovisie geldende tarieven, indien mogelijk, overeengekomen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in overleg met andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen die de route of een deel daarvan exploiteren. Deze overeenstemming dient, indien mogelijk, te worden bereikt met behulp van de procedures voor het vaststellen van tarieven van de Internationale Luchtvervoersvereniging.   
3.  De aldus overeengekomen tarieven worden aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter goedkeuring voorgelegd ten minste dertig (30) dagen vóór de voorgestelde datum van invoering. In bijzondere gevallen kan dit tijdvak worden verkort, indien de genoemde autoriteiten daarin toestemmen.   
4.  Indien de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over deze tarieven, of indien door enige andere oorzaak een tarief niet kan worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, of indien in de loop van de eerste vijftien (15) dagen van het tijdvak van dertig (30) dagen, bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel, een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kennis geeft van haar bezwaar tegen enig tarief, overeengekomen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel, trachten de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in onderling overleg het tarief vast te stellen.   
5.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de goedkeuring van een tarief dat hun is voorgelegd overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, of omtrent de vaststelling van een tarief volgens het vierde lid, wordt het geschil opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 13 van deze Overeenkomst.   
6.  Behoudens de bepalingen van het vijfde lid van dit artikel, wordt een tarief niet van kracht indien het niet door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is goedgekeurd.   
7.  De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht, totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  10  

####Opstelling van statistieken

1.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschaffen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, op verzoek van laatstgenoemde, periodieke of andere statistische gegevens die redelijkerwijze nodig zijn om de capaciteit te beoordelen, die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op de overeengekomen diensten wordt aangeboden.   
2.  Deze gegevens dienen tevens alle inlichtingen te bevatten die nodig zijn om de omvang van het vervoer te bepalen, vervoerd door de luchtvaartmaatschappij op de overeengekomen diensten, alsmede de herkomst en de bestemming van dat vervoer.   

### Artikel  11  

####Overmaking van netto-ontvangsten

1.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verleent aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht tot het overmaken tegen de officiële wisselkoers, van het verschil tussen ontvangsten en uitgaven, geboekt door de luchtvaartmaatschappij op haar grondgebied ter zake van het vervoer van passagiers, post en vracht, zulks krachtens de op het grondgebied van iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij geldende voorschriften.   
2.  Wanneer ten aanzien van het tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gehanteerde betalingsstelsel een speciale overeenkomst geldt, is deze overeenkomst van toepassing in plaats van de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  12  

####Overleg

1.  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd met elkaar overleg ten einde de uitvoering en bevredigende naleving van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de daaraan gehechte Bijlage te verzekeren; zij plegen eveneens, indien noodzakelijk, overleg omtrent wijziging daarvan.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan het verzoek doen tot het plegen van overleg; dit overleg, hetwelk mondeling dan wel schriftelijk kan geschieden, moet een aanvang nemen binnen een tijdvak van zestig (60) dagen, te rekenen van de datum van het verzoek, tenzij beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen instemmen met verlenging van dit tijdvak.   

### Artikel  13  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil mocht ontstaan omtrent de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in de eerste plaats dit geschil te regelen door onderhandelingen.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen, kunnen zij overeenkomen het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan een bepaalde persoon of instantie; indien zij dit niet overeenkomen, wordt het geschil op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht van drie scheidsmannen, van wie er een door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen en de derde door de twee aldus aangewezen scheidsmannen wordt benoemd. Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wijst binnen zestig (60) dagen na het tijdstip waarop de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij langs diplomatieke weg een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen, waarin om voorlegging van het geschil aan een dergelijk scheidsgerecht wordt verzocht, een scheidsman aan en de derde scheidsman wordt binnen een daaraan aansluitend tijdvak van eveneens zestig (60) dagen benoemd. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat binnen het aangegeven tijdvak een scheidsman aan te wijzen, of indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen het aangegeven tijdvak wordt benoemd, kan door elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een verzoek worden gericht tot de President van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie om een scheidsman of eventueel scheidsmannen te benoemen. In beide gevallen dient de derde scheidsman een onderdaan te zijn van een derde Staat en dient hij op te treden als president van het scheidsgerecht.   
3.  Het scheidsgerecht tracht allereerst de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met elkaar te verzoenen; slaagt het hierin niet, dan bestudeert dit het geschil en neemt een besluit bij meerderheid van stemmen. Tenzij anders tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zelf zijn huishoudelijk reglement op, bepaalt het zelf de plaats van bijeenkomst en neemt een beslissing binnen negentig (90) dagen na het tijdstip waarop het werd samengesteld.   
4.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen houden zich aan iedere ingevolge het tweede of derde lid van dit artikel genomen beslissing.   
5.  Iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is verantwoordelijk voor de kosten van zijn aangewezen scheidsman en zijn medewerkers en beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen delen gelijkelijk alle verdere kosten, voortvloeiend uit de werkzaamheden van het scheidsgerecht, waaronder begrepen die van de Voorzitter.   
6.  Indien en zolang een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen nalaat zich te houden aan een ingevolge dit artikel genomen beslissing, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij alle rechten of voorrechten die zij krachtens deze Overeenkomst aan de in gebreke blijvende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of haar aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft verleend, beperken, opschorten of intrekken.

2.  Een wijziging van deze Overeenkomst waartoe gedurende het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde overleg is besloten, wordt schriftelijk tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeengekomen en wordt van kracht op een door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vast te stellen datum, die daartoe langs diplomatieke weg nota's zullen wisselen, waarbij wordt bevestigd dat aan de in hun onderscheiden landen constitutioneel vereiste formaliteiten is voldaan.   
3.  Een wijziging van de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst, die tijdens het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde overleg door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, wordt van kracht op een door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen vast te stellen datum, die daartoe langs diplomatieke weg nota's zullen wisselen.

####Exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten

a.  Tenzij anders wordt overeengekomen tussen de beide aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen en behoudens de bepalingen van letter c van dit artikel, wordt de capaciteit bij de exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten gelijkelijk verdeeld tussen de genoemde luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
b.  De totale capaciteit die op elk van de omschreven routes wordt geboden, dient in overeenstemming te zijn met een redelijkerwijze te verwachten vraag naar vervoer.   
c.  Ten einde te kunnen voldoen aan de eisen van een door het seizoen bepaalde of toekomstige groei van het vervoer op de in de Bijlage omschreven routes, maken de door beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen afspraken ter zake van de voorwaarden waaronder de luchtdiensten dienen te worden geëxploiteerd. In de aldus door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen gemaakte afspraken worden de frequentie van de diensten en de dienstregelingen vastgesteld. Deze afspraken, alsmede eventuele wijzigingen hiervan, worden ter goedkeuring voorgelegd aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
d.  Indien en zolang de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen haar eigen aandeel van de capaciteit op een of meer routes geheel of gedeeltelijk niet wenst te benutten, kan deze de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij toestaan genoemd deel van de haar toekomende capaciteit gedurende een omschreven tijdvak te gebruiken.
