If, following such consultations, one Party finds that the other Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards and requirements in these areas that at least equal the minimum standards that may be established pursuant to the Convention, the other Party shall be notified of such findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with these minimum standards, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Each Party reserves the right to withhold, revoke, or limit the operations authorization or technical permission of an airline or airlines designated by the other Party in the event the other Party does not take such appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time.   

### Article  8  

####Aviation Security

1.  In accordance with their rights and obligations under international law, the Parties reaffirm that their obligation to each other to protect the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference forms an integral part of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Parties shall in particular act in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, done at Tokyo on September 14, 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, done at The Hague on December 16, 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on September 23, 1971, and the [Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/protocol/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/acts/of/violence/at/airports/etc/BWBV0002152/README.md), done at Montreal on February 24, 1988.   
2.  The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, of their passengers and crew, and of airports and air navigation facilities, and to address any other threat to the security of civil air navigation.   
3.  The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization and designated as Annexes to the Convention; they shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators of aircraft who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.   
4.  Each Party agrees to observe the security provisions required by the other Party for entry into, for departure from, and while within the territory of that other Party and to take adequate measures to protect aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew and their baggage and carry-on items, as well as cargo and aircraft stores, prior to and during boarding or loading. Each Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Party for special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of passengers, crew, aircraft, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat.   
6.  When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, the Aeronautical authorities of that Party may request immediate consultations with the Aeronautical authorities of the other Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit, or impose conditions on the operating authorization and technical permissions of an airline or airlines of that Party. When required by an emergency, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.   

### Article  9  

####Commercial Opportunities

1.  The airlines of each Party shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other Party for the promotion and sale of air transportation.   
2.  The designated airlines of each Party shall be entitled, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Party relating to entry, residence, and employment, to bring in and maintain in the territory of the other Party managerial, sales, technical, operational, and other specialist staff required for the provision of air transportation.   
3.  Each designated airline shall have the right to perform its own ground-handling in the territory of the other Party (“self-handling”) or, at its option, select among competing agents for such services in whole or in part. The rights shall be subject only to physical constraints resulting from considerations of airport safety. Where such considerations preclude self-handling, ground services shall be available on an equal basis to all airlines; charges shall be based on the costs of services provided; and such services shall be comparable to the kind and quality of services as if self-handling were possible.   
4.  Any airline of each Party may engage in the sale of air transportation in the territory of the other Party directly and, at the airline’s discretion, through its agents. Each airline shall have the right to sell such transportation, in the currency of that territory or in freely convertible currencies.   
5.  Each airline shall have the right to convert and remit to its country, on demand, local revenues in excess of sums locally disbursed. Conversion and remittance shall be permitted promptly without restrictions or taxation in respect thereof at the rate of exchange applicable to current transaction and remittance on the date the carrier makes the initial application for remittance.   
6.  The airlines of each Party shall be permitted to pay for local expenses, including purchases of fuel, in the territory of the other Party in local currency. At their discretion, the airlines of each Party may pay for such expenses in the territory of the other Party in freely convertible currencies according to local currency regulation.   
7.  In operating or holding out the authorized services on the agreed routes, any designated airline of one Party may enter into co-operative marketing arrangements such as blocked-space, code-sharing, joint ventures or leasing arrangements, with 

a) an airline or airlines of either Party; and  

b) an airline or airlines of a third country, provided that such third country authorizes or allows comparable arrangements between the airlines of the other Party and other airlines on services to, from and via such a third country;   provided that all airlines in such arrangements (1) hold the appropriate authority and (2) meet the requirements normally applied to such arrangements.   

### Article  10  

####User Charges

1.  User charges that may be imposed by the competent charging authorities or bodies of each Party on the airlines of the other Party shall be just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the airlines of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other airline at the time the charges are assessed.   
2.  User charges imposed on the airlines of the other Party may reflect, but shall not exceed, the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport, airport environmental, air navigation, and aviation security facilities and services at the airport or within the airport system. Such full cost may include a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which charges are made shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis.   
3.  Each Party shall encourage consultations between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the airlines using the services and facilities, and shall encourage the competent charging authorities or bodies and the airlines to exchange such information as may be necessary to permit an accurate review of the reasonableness of the charges in accordance with the principles of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article. Each Party shall encourage the competent charging authorities to provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable users to express their views before changes are made.   
4.  Neither Party shall be held, in dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Article 16, to be in breach of a provision of this Article, unless (1) it fails to undertake a review of the charge or practice that is the subject of complaint by the other Party within a reasonable amount of time; or (2) following such a review it fails to take all steps within its power to remedy any charge or practice that is inconsistent with this Article.   

### Article  11  

####Computer Reservation System (CRS)

1.  The Parties agree that: 

a) the interest of consumers of air transport products will be protected from any misuse of such information including misleading presentation thereof;  

b) a designated airline of a Party and the airline’s agents will have unrestricted and non-discriminatory access to and use of CRS in the territory of the other Party;  

c) in this respect the ICAO CRS Code of Conduct shall be applicable.     
2.  Each Party guarantees to the other Party free and unimpaired access in its territory to the CRS’s chosen as its primary system by the designated airline(s) of the Parties. Neither Party shall, in its territory, impose or permit to be imposed on the CRS of the designated airline(s) of the other Party more stringent requirements than those imposed on the CRS of its own designated airline(s), such as with respect to: 

a) the operation and sale of the CRS services including CRS display and editing rules, and  

b) the access to and use of communications facilities, selection and use of technical hardware and software or the installation of hardware.     

### Article  12  

####Fair Competition

1.  Each Party shall allow a fair and equal opportunity for the designated airlines of both Parties to compete in providing the air transportation governed by this Agreement.   
2.  Each Party shall allow each designated airline to determine the frequency and capacity of the air transportation it offers based upon commercial considerations in the marketplace. Consistent with this right, neither Party shall unilaterally limit the volume of traffic, frequency or regularity of service, or the aircraft type or types operated by the designated airlines of the other Party, except as may be required for customs, technical, operational, or environmental reasons under uniform conditions consistent with Article 15 of the Convention.   
3.  Neither Party shall impose on the other Party’s designated airlines a first-refusal requirement, uplift ratio, no-objection fee, or any other requirement with respect to capacity, frequency or traffic that would be inconsistent with the purposes of this Agreement.   
4.  Neither Party shall require the filing of flight schedules, programs for charter flights, or operational plans by airlines of the other Party for approval, except as may be required on a non-discriminatory basis to enforce the uniform conditions foreseen by paragraph 2 of this Article or as may be specifically authorized in an Annex to this Agreement. If a Party requires filings for information purposes, it shall minimize the administrative burdens of filing requirements and procedures on air transportation intermediaries and on designated airlines of the other Party.   
5.  The Parties agree that the following airline practices may be regarded as possible unfair competitive practices which may merit closer examination: 

– charging fares and rates at levels which are, in the aggregate, insufficient to cover the costs of providing the services to which they relate;  

– the addition of excessive capacity or frequency of service;  

– the practices in question are sustained rather than temporary;  

– the practices in question have a serious negative economic effect on, or cause significant damage to, another airline;  

– the practices in question reflect an apparent intent or have the probable effect, of crippling, excluding or driving another airline from the market; and  

– behaviour indicating an abuse of dominant position on the route.     
6.  If the Aeronautical authorities of one Party consider that an operation or operations intended or conducted by a designated carrier of the other Party may constitute unfair competitive behaviour in accordance with the indicators listed in paragraph 5, they may request consultation in accordance with Article 15 (Consultations and amendment) with a view to resolving the problem. Any such request shall be accompanied by notice of the reasons for the request and the consultation shall begin within fifteen (15) days of the request.   

### Article  13  

####Pricing

1.  Each Party shall allow prices for air transportation to be established by each designated airline based upon commercial considerations in the marketplace. Intervention by the Parties shall be limited to: 

a) prevention of unreasonably discriminatory prices or practices;  

b) protection of consumers from prices that are unreasonably high or restrictive due to the abuse of a dominant position; and  

c) protection of airlines from prices that are artificially low due to direct or indirect governmental subsidy or support.     
2.  Each Party may require notification to or filing with its Aeronautical authorities of prices to be charged to or from its territory by airlines of the other Party. Notification or filing by the airlines of both Parties may be required no more than thirty (30) days before the proposed date of effectiveness. In individual cases, notification or filing may be permitted on shorter notice than normally required. Neither Party shall require the notification or filing by airlines of the other Party of prices charged by charterers to the public, except as may be required on a non-discriminatory basis for information purposes.   
3.  Neither Party shall take unilateral action to prevent the inauguration or continuation of a price proposed to be charged by (1) an airline of either Party for international air transportation between the territories of the Parties, or (2) an airline of one Party for air transportation between the territory of the other Party and any other country, including in both cases transportation on an interline or intraline basis. If either Party believes that any such price is inconsistent with the considerations set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall request consultations and notify the other Party of the reasons for its dissatisfaction as soon as possible. These consultations shall be held not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the request, and the Parties shall co-operate in securing information necessary for reasoned resolution of the issue. If the Parties reach agreement with respect to a price for which a notice of dissatisfaction has been given, each Party shall use its best efforts to put that agreement into effect. Without such mutual agreement, the price shall go into effect or continue to be effective.   

### Article  14  

####Taxes, Customs and Charges

1.  Aircraft operating on international air services by the designated airlines of either Party, as well as their regular equipment, spare parts, supplies of fuels and lubricants, aircraft stores (including food, beverages and tobacco) on board as well as advertising and promotion material kept on board such aircraft shall be exempt from all customs duties, inspection fees and similar national or local duties and charges, on arrival on the territory of the Party, provided such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft up to such time as they are re-exported.   
2.  With regard to regular equipment, spare parts, supplies of fuels and lubricants and aircraft stores introduced into the territory of one Party by or on behalf of a designated airline of the other Party or taken on board the aircraft operated by such designated airline and intended solely for use on board aircraft while operating international services, no duties and charges, including customs duties and inspection fees imposed in the territory of the first Party, shall be applied, even when these supplies are to be used on the parts of the journey performed over the territory of the Party in which they are taken on board. The Articles referred to above may be required to be kept under customs supervision and control. The provisions of this paragraph cannot be interpreted in such a way that a Party can be made subject to the obligation to refund customs duties which already have been levied on the items referred to in the above mentioned Article.   
3.  Regular airborne equipment, spare parts, supplies fuels and lubricants and aircraft stores retained on board the aircraft of either Party may be unloaded in the territory of the other Party only with the approval of the customs authorities of that Party, who may require that materials be placed under their supervision up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with customs regulations.   

### Article  15  

####Consultations and amendment

1.  Either Party may, at any time, request consultations relating to the implementation of this Agreement and the amendment of this Agreement or its Annexes. Such consultations shall begin at the earliest possible date, but not later than sixty (60) days from the date the other Party receives the request, unless otherwise agreed.   
2.  Any amendment to the present Agreement agreed upon by the Parties shall come into force on the date on which the Parties have informed each other in writing of the completion of their respective constitutional requirements.   
3.  Any amendment to the Annexes to the present Agreement shall be agreed upon in writing between the Aeronautical authorities and shall take effect upon confirmation by an exchange of Diplomatic Notes.   

### Article  16  

####Settlement of Disputes

1.  Any dispute arising under this Agreement, except those that may arise under paragraph 3 of Article 13 (Pricing), that is not resolved by a first round of formal consultations may be referred by agreement of the Parties for decision to some person or body. If the Parties do not so agree, the dispute shall, at the request of either Party, be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth below.   
2.  Arbitration shall be by a tribunal of three arbitrators to be constituted as follows: 

a) Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a request for arbitration, each Party shall name one arbitrator. Within sixty (60) days after these two arbitrators have been named, they shall by agreement appoint a third arbitrator, who shall act as President of the arbitral tribunal;  

b) If either Party fails to name an arbitrator, or if the third arbitrator is not appointed in accordance with subparagraph a of this paragraph, either Party may request the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to appoint the necessary arbitrator or arbitrators within thirty (30) days. If the President of the Council is of the same nationality as one of the Parties, the most senior Vice President who is not disqualified on that ground shall make the appointment.     
3.  Except as otherwise agreed, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the limits of its jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement and shall establish its own procedural rules. The tribunal, once formed, may recommend interim relief measures pending its final determination. At the direction of the tribunal or at the request of either of the Parties, a conference to determine the precise issues to be arbitrated and the specific procedures to be followed shall be held not later than fifteen (15) days after the tribunal is fully constituted.   
4.  Except as otherwise agreed or as directed by the tribunal, each Party shall submit a memorandum within forty-five (45) days of the time the tribunal is fully constituted. Replies shall be due sixty (60) days later. The tribunal shall hold a hearing at the request of either Party or on its own initiative within fifteen (15) days after replies are due.   
5.  The tribunal shall attempt to render a written decision within thirty (30) days after completion of the hearing or, if no hearing is held, after the date both replies are submitted. The decision or award of the majority of the tribunal shall prevail.   
6.  The Parties may submit requests for clarification of the decision within fifteen (15) days after it is rendered and any clarification given shall be issued within fifteen (15) days of such request.   
7.  Each Party shall give full effect to any decision or award of the arbitral tribunal. The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding.   
8.  The expenses of the arbitral tribunal, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, shall be shared equally by the Parties. Any expenses incurred by the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization in connection with the procedures of paragraph 2b of this Article shall be considered to be part of the expenses of the arbitral tribunal.   

### Article  17  

####Multilateral Conventions

If a general multilateral air transport convention comes into force in respect of both Parties, the provisions of such convention shall prevail. Consultations in accordance with Article 15 of this Agreement may be held with a view to determining the extent to which this Agreement is affected by the provisions of the multilateral convention.
