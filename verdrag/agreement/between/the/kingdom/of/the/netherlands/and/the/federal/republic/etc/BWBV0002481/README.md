### Article  7  

####Business Profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses shown to have been incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.   
4.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. Provided that where that permanent establishment is also used as a sales outlet for the goods or merchandise so purchased the profits on such sales may be attributed to that permanent establishment.   
5.  In the case of profits from survey, supply, installation or construction activities only so much of them is attributable to a permanent establishment as results from the actual performance of these activities through that permanent establishment. Accordingly, profits from deliveries of goods, whether or not in connection with these activities, to that permanent establishment by the head office, another permanent establishment or a third person shall not be attributed to that permanent establishment. Provided such profits do not accrue in the execution of such survey, supply, installation or construction activities in the other State.   
6.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####Shipping and Air Transport

1.  A resident of one of the States shall on reciprocal basis only, be exempt from tax in the other State in respect of profits derived from the operations of ships or aircraft in international traffic.   
2.  For the purposes of this Agreement, profits derived by an enterprise of one of the States from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic provided that such profits are incidental to the profits described in paragraph 1 of this Article.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated Enterprises

1.  Where 

a) an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.     
2.  Where one of the States includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

a) 12½ per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.     
3.  The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims participating in profits as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in one of the States and paid to the Government of the other State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or any agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) owned or controlled by that Government, political subdivision or local authority as well as interest on loans insured or guaranteed by the Government of that other State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State. In the case of loans made by the above-mentioned agencies or instrumentalities the provisions of this paragraph will only apply in case these loans are not made on normal commercial conditions.   
4.  The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
5.  The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest,whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.   

### Article  12  

####Royalties

1.  Royalties arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such royalties may also be taxed in the State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 12½ per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.   
3.  The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer in that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the contract under which the royalties are paid was concluded, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 16 and Article 19 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in corformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 4 of Article 13, Article 17, sub-paragraph a) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Nigeria on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. Where by reason of the relief given under the provisions of Nigerian laws for the purposes of encouraging investment in Nigeria the Nigerian tax actually levied on interest arising in Nigeria or on royalties arising in Nigeria is lower than the tax Nigeria may levy according to paragraph 2 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 12, respectively, then the amount of the tax paid in Nigeria on such interest and royalties shall be deemed to have been paid at the rates of tax mentioned in the said provisions. However, if the general tax rates under Nigerian laws applicable to the afore-mentioned interest and royalties are reduced below those mentioned in this paragraph, these lower rates shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply for a period of ten years after the date on which the Agreement became effective. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.   
4.  Subject to the provisions of the law of Nigeria regarding the allowance as a credit against Nigerian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Nigeria (which shall not affect the general principle hereof): 

a) Netherlands tax payable under the laws of the Netherlands and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within the Netherlands (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any Nigerian tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which Netherlands tax is computed.  

b) In the case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a company which is resident in Nigeria and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Netherlands tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of subparagraph a) of this paragraph) the Netherlands tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.   For the purposes of this Article in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and desinvestment payments as meant in the Netherlands Investment Account Law ("Wet investeringsrekening") shall not be taken into account as they do not form part of the taxes referred to in paragraphs 1 a) and 2 of Article 2.   

### CHAPTER  V

### Article  24  

####Non-Discrimination

2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.

### Article  25

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.   
2.

2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;

### Protocol  

At the moment of signing the Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains, this day concluded between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Agreement. 

I.  *Ad Article 7*  In respect of paragraph 1 of Article 7, profits derived from the sale of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold, or from other business activities of the same or similar kind as those effected, through that permanent establishment, may be considered attributable to that permanent establishment. This provision will only be applicable where sales or business activities are effected by an enterprise of one of the States in the other State through other outlets or fixed points than its permanent establishment.  

II.  *Ad Article 7*  Payments received as a consideration for technical services, including studies or surveys of a scientific, geological or technical nature, or for engineering contracts including blue prints related thereto, or for consultant or supervisory services shall be deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.  

III.  *Ad Article 8*  If the competent authorities of the States have agreed on the basis of Article 25 that profits as meant in Article 8 are derived by an enterprise or enterprises of one of the States from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the other State and that such profits are not derived by an enterprise or enterprises of the other State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the first-mentioned State and that such situation has a permanent nature, the condition of reciprocity as envisaged in paragraph 1 of Article 8 is not met and, no exemption shall be granted; in such case, the tax so charged shall be 1 per cent of the earnings of the enterprise derived from the other State. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term "earnings" means income derived by a shipping or air transport enterprise of one of the States from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods boarded or loaded in the other State, less the refunds and payments of wages and salaries of ground staff and excluding the income derived from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods which are brought to that other State solely for transhipments or transfer.  

IV.  *Ad Article 9*  It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as costsharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent one of the States from checking the above-mentioned arrangements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.  

V.  *Ad Articles 10, 11 and 12*  

(i) The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of the reductions and exemptions from tax in the State of source given by Articles 10, 11 and 12.  

(ii) Where tax has been levied at source in excess of the amount of tax chargeable under the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, applications for refund of the excess amount of tax have to be lodged with the competent authority of the State having levied the tax, within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.    

VI.  *Ad Article 13*  It is understood that the terms corporate organization, reorganization, amalgamation, division or similar transaction refer to a transfer of shares within a group of associated enterprises. In that case the shares will be evaluated for the transferee at the bookvalue of the transferor.  

VII.  *Ad Article 16*  It is understood that "bestuurder" or "commissaris" of a Netherlands company means persons, who are nominated as such by the general meeting of shareholders or by any other competent body of such company and are charged with the general management of the company or the supervision thereof, respectively.  

VIII.  *Ad Article 24*  It is understood that in both States, interest, royalties and other disbursement paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State, for the purpose of determining according to its tax legislation the taxable profits of such enterprise, are deductible in the same way as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorized thereto, have signed this Agreement. DONE at Lagos this 11th day of December, 1991, in duplicate, in the English language.

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten, waaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten, waarvan is aangetoond dat ze zijn gemaakt ten behoeve van het bedrijf van de vaste inrichting, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders. Geen aftrek wordt echter toegestaan ter zake van bedragen (met uitzondering van die wegens vergoeding van werkelijke kosten) welke eventueel door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren worden betaald, als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooien of andere rechten, of als commissieloon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan de vaste inrichting zijn geleend. Evenmin wordt bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting rekening gehouden met bedragen (anders dan die wegens vergoeding van werkelijke kosten) welke door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren in rekening worden gebracht als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooi en of andere rechten, of als commissie loon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan de vaste inrichting zijn geleend. Evenmin wordt bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting rekening gehouden met bedragen (anders dan die wegens vergoeding van werkelijke kosten) welke door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren in rekening worden gebracht als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooi- en of andere rechten, of als commissieloon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren zijn geleend.   
4.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van de aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming. Zulks evenwel met dien verstande dat wanneer die vaste inrichting mede als een verkoopgelegenheid voor de aldus aangekochte goederen of koopwaar wordt gebruikt de voordelen behaald op dergelijke verkopen aan die vaste inrichting mogen worden toegerekend.   
5.  In geval van voordelen uit werkzaamheden van toezichthoudende aard, leveringen, installatie- of constructiewerkzaamheden is slechts dat gedeelte toe te rekenen aan een vaste inrichting dat het gevolg is van de werkelijk door die vaste inrichting verrichte werkzaamheden. Dienovereenkomstig worden voordelen uit de leveringen van goederen aan die vaste inrichting door het hoofdkantoor, een andere vaste inrichting of een derde persoon, al of niet in samenhang met deze werkzaamheden, niet toegerekend aan die vaste inrichting. Zulks evenwel met dien verstande dat deze voordelen niet voortvloeien uit de uitvoering van dergelijke werkzaamheden van toezichthoudende aard, leveringen, installatie- of constructiewerkzaamheden in de andere Staat.   
6.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

####Zee- en luchtvervoer

1.  Een inwoner van een van de Staten zal alleen op basis van wederkerigheid van belasting zijn vrijgesteld in de andere Staat met betrekking tot voordelen verkregen uit de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst omvatten voordelen verkregen door een onderneming van een van de Staten met de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer voordelen uit de verhuur van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in onbemande staat die in het internationale verkeer worden geëxploiteerd, mits deze voordelen voortvloeien uit de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool”, een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a. een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b. dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat, en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.     
2.  Indien een van de Staten in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt - en dienovereenkomstig belast - ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van éen van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a. 12½ percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam is (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma) dat onmiddellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b. 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen. Dit lid laat onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.     
3.  De uitdrukking „dividenden”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, of andere rechten, niet zijnde schuldvorderingen die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst alsmede inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
5.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Staat waaruit hij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 12½ percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel is interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan de Regering van de andere Staat, een staatkundig onderdeel of plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan dan wel aan een agentschap of instantie (waaronder begrepen een financiële instelling) die eigendom is van of beheerst wordt door die Regering, dat staatkundig onderdeel of plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam, alsmede interest ter zake van leningen die verzekerd of gegarandeerd zijn door de Regering van die andere Staat, een staatkundig onderdeel of plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan, vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat. In het geval van leningen verstrekt door de bovengenoemde agentschappen of instanties zijn de bepalingen van dit lid alleen van toepassing in geval deze leningen niet zijn verstrekt onder de gewone commerciële voorwaarden.   
4.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek, en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen. In rekening gebrachte boeten voor te late betaling worden voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en het tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat van waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien deze wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Wanneer evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft in verband waarmee de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 12½ percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De uitdrukking „royalty's”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap met inbegrip van bioscoopfilms, of films of geluidsbanden voor radio of televisie, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, dan wel voor het gebruik van, of het recht van gebruik van, nijverheids- of handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat van waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
5.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft in verband waarmee het contract op grond waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, was gesloten, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
6.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13

2.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende zaken die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, of van roerende zaken die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, zijn in de andere Staat vrijgesteld van belasting.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere zaken dan die bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is. Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van aandelen die zijn uitgegeven door een lichaam dat inwoner is in de andere Staat, mogen echter in die andere Staat worden belast, tenzij die voordelen worden behaald in het kader van de oprichting van een lichaam, reorganisatie, fusie, splitsing of soortgelijke transactie.   

### Artikel  14  

####Zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten in de uitoefening van een vrij beroep of ter zake van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij hij in de andere Staat voor het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden geregeld over een vast middelpunt beschikt. Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep” omvat in het bijzonder zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.

Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een in de andere Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstbedoelde Staat belastbaar, indien: 

a. de genieter in de andere Staat verblijft gedurende een tijdvak of tijdvakken, die in het belastingjaar of jaar van aanslag van die Staat een totaal van 183 dagen niet te boven gaan, en  

b. de beloning wordt betaald door of namens een werkgever die geen inwoner van de andere Staat is, en

2.  Indien inkomsten ter zake van persoonlijke werkzaamheden die door een artiest of een sportbeoefenaar in die hoedanigheid worden verricht, niet aan de artiest of sportbeoefenaar zelf toekomen, maar aan een andere persoon, mogen die inkomsten, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 7, 14 en 15, worden belast in de Staat waarin de werkzaamheden van de artiest of sportbeoefenaar worden verricht.

1. onderdaan is van die Staat; of  

2. niet uitsluitend voor het verrichten van de diensten inwoner van die Staat werd.

####Overige inkomsten

1.  Bestanddelen van het inkomen van een inwoner van een van de Staten, van waaruit ook afkomstig, die niet in de voorgaande artikelen van deze Overeenkomst zijn behandeld, zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar.

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  23  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nigeria mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, vierde lid, artikel 11, vijfde lid, artikel 12, vierde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, artikel 16 en artikel 19 van deze Overeenkomst in Nigeria mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomensbestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde bestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 13, vierde lid, artikel 17, artikel 18, eerste lid, onderdeel a en tweede lid en artikel 22, tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Nigeria mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Nigeria over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld. Indien wegens een tegemoetkoming verleend op grond van de bepalingen van de Nigeriaanse wetgeving ter bevordering van investeringen in Nigeria, de in feite geheven Nigeriaanse belasting op uit Nigeria afkomstige interest of op uit Nigeria afkomstige royalty's, minder bedraagt dan de belasting die Nigeria ingevolge onderscheidenlijk artikel 11, tweede lid, en artikel 12, tweede lid, mag heffen, wordt het bedrag van de in Nigeria over die interest en royalty's betaalde belasting geacht te zijn betaald naar de in voornoemde bepalingen vermelde tarieven. Indien evenwel de ingevolge de Nigeriaanse wetgeving op vorengenoemde interest en royalty's van toepassing zijnde algemene belastingtarieven worden verlaagd beneden die welke in dit lid zijn genoemd, gelden voor de toepassing van dit lid deze lagere tarieven. De bepalingen van dit lid zijn slechts van toepassing gedurende een tijdvak van tien jaar na de datum waarop de Overeenkomst in werking is getreden. Dit tijdvak kan in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten worden verlengd.   
4.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de wetgeving van Nigeria die betrekking hebben op de verrekening van belasting die in een gebied buiten Nigeria verschuldigd is, met Nigeriaanse belasting (welke bepalingen het algemene beginsel van het hiernavolgende niet mogen aantasten), wordt: 

a. Nederlandse belasting die krachtens de wetgeving van Nederland en in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door inhouding, verschuldigd is over uit Nederlandse bronnen verkregen voordelen, inkomsten of belastbare vermogenswinsten (met uitzondering, in het geval van dividend, van belasting te betalen ter zake van de winst waaruit het dividend is betaald) verrekend met Nigeriaanse belasting berekend over dezelfde voordelen, inkomsten of belastbare vermogenswinsten als die waarover de Nederlandse belasting wordt berekend,  

b. In het geval van een dividend dat wordt betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland aan een lichaam dat inwoner is van Nigeria en dat onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het stemgerechtigde kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt, wordt bij de verrekening (naast de Nederlandse belasting waarvoor verrekening is toegestaan op grond van de bepalingen van onderdeel a van dit lid) rekening gehouden met de Nederlandse belasting die door het lichaam verschuldigd is met betrekking tot de winst waaruit dit dividend is betaald.   Voor de toepassing van dit artikel worden bij de vaststelling van de belastingen naar het inkomen die aan Nederland zijn betaald, de investeringsbijdragen en -toeslagen en de desinvesteringsbetalingen, als bedoeld in de Nederlandse Wet investeringsrekening niet in aanmerking genomen, aangezien zij geen deel uitmaken van de belastingen als bedoeld in artikel 2, eerste lid, onderdeel a, en tweede lid.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  24  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 1 worden onderdanen van een van de Staten in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen.   
3.  Dit artikel mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat het een van beide Staten verplicht aan natuurlijke personen die geen inwoner van de andere Staat zijn bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die de eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere, soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 24, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de Overeenkomst, te vermijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van de Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  26  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen die inlichtingen (zijnde inlichtingen die deze autoriteiten geordend voorhanden hebben) uit die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst. Alle aldus uitgewisselde inlichtingen worden geheim gehouden en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (waaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die zich bezig houden met de vaststelling, invordering, de tenuitvoerlegging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken met betrekking tot de belastingen die het onderwerp van deze Overeenkomst uitmaken en mogen alleen voor deze doeleinden worden gebruikt.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zo uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a. administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b. inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn krachtens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c. inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, of inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  27  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

1.  De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 4, eerste lid, wordt een natuurlijke persoon die deel uitmaakt van een diplomatieke, consulaire of permanente vertegenwoordiging van een van de Staten die gevestigd is in de andere Staat of in een derde Staat en die in die andere Staat of in die derde Staat slechts aan belasting onderworpen is indien hij inkomen verkrijgt uit bronnen uit die Staat, geacht inwoner te zijn van de zendstaat.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot Aruba en/of de Nederlandse Antillen, indien het betreffende land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van de Overeenkomst niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van de Overeenkomst tot enig land waartoe zij ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.

### Protocol  

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting en het voorkomen van het ontgaan van belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen en naar vermogenswinsten, heden tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Federale Republiek Nigeria gesloten, zijn de ondergetekenden overeengekomen dat de volgende bepalingen een integrerend deel van de Overeenkomst vormen. 

I.  *Ad artikel 7*  Met betrekking tot artikel 7, eerste lid, kunnen voordelen behaald met de verkoop van goederen of koopwaar van dezelfde of soortgelijke aard als die welke worden verkocht, of met andere bedrijfsactiviteiten van dezelfde of soortgelijke aard als die welke worden verricht door middel van die vaste inrichting, worden geacht toerekenbaar te zijn aan die vaste inrichting. Deze bepaling is slechts van toepassing wanneer de verkoop of bedrijfsactiviteiten door een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat worden verricht door middel van andere vestigingen of verkooppunten dan haar vaste inrichting.  

II.  *Ad artikel 7*  Betalingen ontvangen als een vergoeding voor het verrichten van technische diensten, waaronder begrepen studies of toezichthoudende werkzaamheden van wetenschappelijke, geologische of technische aard, of voor contracten inzake bouw- of constructiewerkzaamheden met inbegrip van de daarop betrekking hebbende blauwdrukken, of voor diensten van raadgevende of toezichthoudende aard, worden beschouwd als voordelen van een onderneming, waarop de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing zijn.  

III.  *Ad artikel 8*  Indien de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten op grond van artikel 25 overeenstemming hebben bereikt over het feit dat voordelen zoals bedoeld in artikel 8 worden behaald door een onderneming of door ondernemingen van een van de Staten met de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer naar of van plaatsen in de andere Staat en dat die voordelen niet worden behaald door een onderneming of door ondernemingen van de andere Staat met de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer naar of van plaatsen in de eerstbedoelde Staat en over het feit dat die situatie van duurzame aard is, wordt aan de voorwaarde van wederkerigheid zoals voorzien in artikel 8, eerste lid, niet voldaan en wordt geen vrijstelling verleend; in dat geval zal de aldus geheven belasting 1 percent bedragen van de opbrengsten van de onderneming verkregen uit de andere Staat. Voor de toepassing van de voorafgaande volzin betekent de uitdrukking „opbrengsten" inkomsten verkregen door een scheep- of luchtvaartonderneming van een van de Staten uit het vervoer van personen, post, levende have of goederen die in de andere Staat aan boord worden gebracht of geladen verminderd met de terugbetalingen en betalingen van lonen en salarissen van het grondpersoneel en met uitzondering van inkomsten die worden verkregen uit het vervoer van personen, post, levende have of goederen naar die andere Staat uitsluitend voor overscheping of overlading.  

IV.  *Ad Artikel 9*  Het is wel verstaan, dat de omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten,-zoals "cost sharing" overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, de kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in artikel 9, eerste lid. Dit belet een van de Staten echter niet te onderzoeken of in de bovengenoemde overeenkomsten voorwaarden als bedoeld in artikel 9, eerste lid, voorkomen.   

V.  *Ad Artikelen 10, 11 en 12*  

(i) De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderling overleg de wijze van toepassing, van de verminderingen en vrijstellingen van belasting in de bronstaat zoals voorzien in de artikelen 10, 11 en 12.  

(ii) Waar aan de bron belasting is geheven die de belasting die ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 10, 11 en 12 mag worden geheven, te boven gaat, moeten verzoeken om teruggaaf van het daarboven uitgaande belastingbedrag worden ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven binnen een tijdvak van drie jaar na afloop van het kalenderjaar waarin de belasting is geheven.    

VI.  *Ad Artikel 13*  Het is wel verstaan dat de uitdrukkingen oprichting van een lichaam, reorganisatie, fusie, splitsing of soortgelijke transactie betrekking hebben op een overdracht van aandelen binnen een groep van verbonden ondernemingen. In dat geval worden de aandelen voor de verkrijger gewaardeerd naar de boekwaarde van de overdrager.  

VII.  *Ad Artikel 16*  Het is wel verstaan dat met „bestuurder” of „commissaris” van een Nederlands lichaam worden bedoeld personen die als zodanig zijn benoemd door de algemene vergadering van aandeelhouders of door enig ander bevoegd orgaan van dat lichaam, en zijn belast met de algemene leiding van het lichaam, onderscheidenlijk met het toezicht daarop.  

VIII.  *Ad Artikel 24*  Het is wel verstaan dat in beide Staten interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, ten behoeve van de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming overeenkomstig zijn belastingwetgeving, op dezelfde wijze aftrekbaar zijn alsof zij waren betaald aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekenden, daartoe behoorlijk gemachtigd, dit Protocol hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te Lagos de 11e december 1991, in tweevoud, in de Engelse taal.
