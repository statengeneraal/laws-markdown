####Ontheffing

### Artikel  16  

1.  De aangezochte administratie is niet verplicht de in dit Verdrag bedoelde bijstand te verlenen indien het waarschijnlijk is dat deze de openbare orde of enig ander wezenlijk belang van de aangezochte Staat zal schaden of tot een schending van een industrieel, commercieel of beroepsgeheim zal leiden.

3.  De bijstand kan door de aangezochte administratie worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat een lopend onderzoek of een lopende vervolging of procedure hiermee wordt doorkruist. In een dergelijk geval pleegt de aangezochte administratie overleg met de verzoekende administratie om te bepalen of de bijstand kan worden verleend onder de voorwaarden of omstandigheden die de aangezochte administratie verlangt.
