##Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Staten van Guernsey inzake de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingzaken

####Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the States of Guernsey for the exchange of information relating to tax matters

Whereas the States of Guernsey and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (“the Parties”) recognise that present legislation already provides for cooperation and the exchange of information in criminal tax matters; Whereas the Parties have long been active in international efforts in the fight against financial and other crimes, including the targeting of terrorist financing; Whereas it is acknowledged that the States of Guernsey has the right, under the terms of the Entrustment from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to negotiate, conclude, perform and subject to the terms of this agreement terminate a tax information exchange agreement with the Netherlands; Whereas the States of Guernsey on the 21st February 2002 entered into a political commitment to the OECD’s principles of effective exchange of information; Whereas the Parties wish to enhance and facilitate the terms and conditions governing the exchange of information relating to taxes;   Now, therefore, the Parties have agreed to conclude the following agreement which contains obligations on the part of the Parties only:

5.  Any request for information shall be formulated with the greatest detail possible in specifying in writing;

f) grounds for believing that the information requested is present in the requested Party or is in the possession of or obtainable by a person within the jurisdiction of the requested Party;  

g) to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession or control of the information requested;

### Article  5

With reasonable notice, the requesting Party may request that the requested Party allow representatives of the competent authority of the requesting Party to enter the territory of the requested Party, to the extent permitted under its domestic laws, to interview individuals and examine records with the prior written consent of the individuals or other persons concerned. The competent authority of the requesting Party shall notify the competent authority of the requested Party of the time and place of the intended meeting with the individuals concerned.   
2.  At the request of the competent authority of the requesting Party, the competent authority of the requested Party may permit representatives of the competent authority of the requesting Party to attend a tax examination in the territory of the requested Party.   
3.  If the request referred to in paragraph 2 is granted, the competent authority of the requested Party conducting the examination shall, as soon as possible, notify the competent authority of the requesting Party of the time and place of the examination, the authority or person authorised to carry out the examination and the procedures and conditions required by the requested Party for the conduct of the examination.

3.  A request for information shall not be refused on the ground that the tax claim giving rise to the request is disputed.   
4.  The requested Party shall not be required to obtain and provide information which if the requested information was within the jurisdiction of the requesting Party the competent authority of the requesting Party would not be able to obtain under its laws or in the normal course of administrative practice.   
5.  The requested Party may decline a request for information if the information is requested by the requesting Party to administer or enforce a provision of the tax law of the requesting Party, or any requirement connected therewith, which discriminates against a national or citizen of the requested Party as compared with a national or citizen of the requesting Party in the same circumstances.   

### Article  7  

####Confidentiality

1.  All information provided and received by the competent authorities of the Parties shall be kept confidential.   
2.  Such information shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the purposes specified in Article 1, and used by such persons or authorities only for such purposes, including the determination of any appeal.

####Memorandum of understanding

Guernsey and the Netherlands desire to strengthen their economic and trading relationship. Both Parties have long been active in international efforts in the fight against financial and other crimes including fiscal crimes and each recognises the other’s commitment to comply with international standards on money laundering, terrorist financing and financial regulation. Guernsey and the Netherlands are committed to deepening their relationship through cooperation on greater transparency and exchange of information on tax matters and with the objective of achieving a double taxation agreement taking account of the specific characteristics of the tax systems of both Parties. Thereby the relationship between Guernsey and the Netherlands is and will continue to be enhanced to the Parties mutual benefit. The Netherlands recognises Guernsey’s commitment to a policy of improving co-operation, reflected, inter alia, in the signing by Guernsey of an Agreement on the Taxation of Savings Income with the Netherlands and each of the other EU Member States. Furthermore, the Netherlands recognises Guernsey’s commitment towards the work of the OECD’s Global Forum on Taxation to achieve a global level playing field in the areas of transparency and effective exchange of information for tax purposes. Guernsey and the Netherlands have agreed to introduce immediately: 

– a tax information exchange agreement;  

– a mutual agreement procedure in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises;  

– a mutual agreement procedure in connection with the conditions for the application of the Netherlands participation exemption and, on this basis, a mutual understanding that will secure the application of the Netherlands participation exemption in accordance with the rules as set out in the Netherlands corporate income tax Act.   As soon as is practicable, and preferably no later than twelve months after the signing of these agreements, Guernsey and the Netherlands shall continue negotiations with the objective of entering into an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to enterprises operating ships or aircraft in international traffic. Six months after the entry into force of these instruments negotiations will continue on further measures needed to alleviate undesired tax barriers and other obstacles of a discriminatory nature that may be included in the domestic tax legislation of the Parties. In preparation for resuming negotiations Guernsey and the Netherlands will study their respective tax systems to identify which undesired tax barriers and other obstacles should be addressed. In due course it is the intention to integrate partial results achieved into a double taxation agreement. Two years after the date of the entry into force of the measures signed today, Guernsey and the Netherlands will jointly evaluate the results achieved and will consider which further steps may be necessary. Formal communications, including requests for information, made in connection with or pursuant to the provisions of the Agreements entered into will be in writing directly to the competent authority of the other party at the addresses given below, or such other address as may be notified by one party to the other from time to time. Any subsequent communications regarding requests for information will be either in writing or verbally, whichever is most practical, between the earlier mentioned competent authorities or their authorised representatives. In the case of Guernsey the address is 

– The Administrator of Income Tax Income Tax Office PO Box No. 37 Guernsey GY1 3AZ   In the case of the Netherlands the address is 

– The Fiscal Information and Investigations Service /Economic Investigation Service, Belastingdienst /FIOD-ECD /Team Internationaal, Postbus 59395 1040 KJ Amsterdam

1.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij kan het verlenen van bijstand afwijzen: 

a. indien het verzoek niet is gedaan in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag;  

b. indien de verzoekende Partij niet alle op haar eigen grondgebied beschikbare middelen heeft aangewend om de informatie te verkrijgen, tenzij aanwending van die middelen zou leiden tot onevenredige moeilijkheden; of  

c. indien bekendmaking van de verzochte informatie in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     
2.  Dit Verdrag verplicht een aangezochte Partij niet tot het verstrekken van stukken waarop de bescherming van de vertrouwelijkheid van toepassing is of van informatie die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, commercieel of beroepsgeheim of een handelswerkwijze zou onthullen, met dien verstande dat de in artikel 4, vierde lid, omschreven informatie niet uitsluitend op grond daarvan als een geheim of handelsproces mag worden aangemerkt.   
3.  Een verzoek om informatie wordt niet geweigerd op grond van het feit dat de belastingvordering die aanleiding gaf tot het verzoek wordt betwist.   
4.  De aangezochte Partij is niet verplicht informatie te verkrijgen en te verschaffen die, indien de verzochte informatie zich in het rechtsgebied van de verzoekende Partij zou bevinden, de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende Partij niet zou kunnen verkrijgen overeenkomstig haar wetgeving of bij de normale gang van zaken in de bestuursrechtelijke praktijk.   
5.  De aangezochte Partij kan een verzoek om informatie afwijzen indien de informatie door de verzoekende Partij wordt gevraagd teneinde een bepaling van de belastingwetgeving van de verzoekende Partij ten uitvoer te leggen of te handhaven die, of een daarmee verband houdend vereiste dat, discriminatie inhoudt van een onderdaan van de aangezochte Partij ten opzichte van een onderdaan van de verzoekende Partij die zich in dezelfde omstandigheden bevindt.   

### Artikel  7  

####Vertrouwelijkheid

1.  Alle door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partijen verschafte of ontvangen informatie wordt vertrouwelijk behandeld.   
2.  Deze informatie wordt uitsluitend bekendgemaakt aan personen of autoriteiten (met inbegrip van gerechtelijke en bestuursrechtelijke instanties) die betrokken zijn bij de doelstellingen omschreven in artikel 1, en door deze personen of autoriteiten uitsluitend voor deze doelstellingen gebruikt, met inbegrip van beslissingen in beroepszaken. Voor deze doeleinden mag informatie worden onthuld tijdens openbare rechtszittingen of bij rechterlijke beslissingen.   
3.  Deze informatie mag zonder uitdrukkelijke schriftelijke toestemming van de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij niet worden gebruikt voor andere doeleinden dan die vermeld in artikel 1.   
4.  Uit hoofde van dit Verdrag aan een verzoekende Partij verschafte informatie mag niet bekend worden gemaakt aan een ander rechtsgebied.   

### Artikel  8  

####Kosten

Tenzij de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partijen anders overeenkomen, worden indirecte kosten gemaakt bij het verlenen van bijstand gedragen door de aangezochte Partij en worden directe kosten gemaakt bij het verlenen van bijstand (met inbegrip van kosten voor het inschakelen van externe adviseurs in verband met een rechtsgeding of andere kosten) gedragen door de verzoekende Partij. De onderscheiden bevoegde autoriteiten plegen van tijd tot tijd overleg met betrekking tot dit artikel en in het bijzonder de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij overlegt vooraf met de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende Partij indien de kosten van het verschaffen van informatie naar aanleiding van een specifiek verzoek naar verwachting aanmerkelijk zullen zijn.  

### Artikel  9
