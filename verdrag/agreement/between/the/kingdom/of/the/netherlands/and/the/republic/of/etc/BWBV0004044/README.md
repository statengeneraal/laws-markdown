####ONTHEFFING

### Artikel  17  

1.  De aangezochte administratie is niet verplicht de in dit Verdrag bedoelde bijstand te verlenen indien deze de openbare orde of enig ander wezenlijk belang van de aangezochte Verdragsluitende Partij zou kunnen schaden of tot een schending van een industrieel of een commercieel geheim, dan wel van een beroepsgeheim zou kunnen leiden.   
2.  Indien de verzoekende administratie niet in staat zou zijn een soortgelijk verzoek van de aangezochte administratie in te willigen, wijst zij daarop in haar verzoek. Inwilliging van een dergelijk verzoek wordt overgelaten aan het oordeel van de aangezochte administratie.   
3.  De bijstand kan door de aangezochte administratie worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat een lopend onderzoek of een lopende vervolging of procedure hiermee wordt doorkruist. In een dergelijk geval pleegt de aangezochte administratie overleg met de verzoekende administratie om te bepalen of de bijstand kan worden verleend onder de voorwaarden of omstandigheden die de aangezochte administratie verlangt.   
4.  Wanneer de bijstand wordt geweigerd of uitgesteld, dienen de redenen voor de weigering of het uitstel te worden gegeven.
