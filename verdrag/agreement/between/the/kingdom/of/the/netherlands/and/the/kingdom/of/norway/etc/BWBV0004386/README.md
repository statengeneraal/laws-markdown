Any modifications so agreed shall come into force when they have been confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes, which shall state that the formalities required by the national legislation of each Contracting Party have been accomplished.  

### Article  10  

1.  If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation.   
2.  If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to some person or body, or the dispute may at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each Contracting Party and the third to be appointed by the two so nominated. Each of the Contracting Parties shall nominate an arbitrator within a period of sixty days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other of a notice through diplomatic channels requesting arbitration of the dispute, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed within a further period of sixty days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to nominate an arbitrator within the period specified, or if the third arbitrator is not appointed within the period specified, the President of the Council of the Civil Aviation Organization may be requested by either Contracting Party to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case requires. In such case, the third arbitrator shall be a national of a third State and shall act as president of the arbitral body.
