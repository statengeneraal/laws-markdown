2.  If a person specified in Article 3, was subject to the legislation of Japan at the time when incapacity for work followed by disability occurred and had previously completed a period of coverage of at least twelve months under the legislation of the Netherlands on disablement benefit for employed persons, that person shall be entitled to a benefit under the latter legislation, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.

4.  The periods of employment and periods treated as such completed in the Netherlands before 1 July, 1967 shall be considered as periods of coverage completed under the legislation of the Netherlands on disablement benefit for employed persons.   

### Article  15

1.  Where a person does not have sufficient periods of coverage to fulfill the requirement for entitlement to Japanese benefits, the competent institution of Japan shall take into account, for the purpose of establishing entitlement to those benefits under this Article, the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Netherlands insofar as they do not coincide with the periods of coverage under the legislation of Japan. However, the foregoing shall not apply to the additional pension for specified occupations under the mutual aid pensions and the lump-sum payments equivalent to the refund of contributions.   
2.  In applying paragraph 1 of this Article, the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Netherlands shall be taken into account as periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees and as corresponding periods of coverage under the National Pension.   

### Article  18  

####Special Provisions concerning Disability Benefits and Survivors’ Benefits

1.  Where the legislation of Japan requires for entitlement to disability benefits or survivors’ benefits (except the lump-sum payments equivalent to the refund of contributions) that the date of the first medical examination or of death lies within specified periods of coverage, this requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled for the purpose of establishing entitlement to those benefits if such a date lies within the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Netherlands. However, if entitlement to disability benefits or survivors’ benefits (except the lump-sum payments equivalent to the refund of contributions) under the National Pension is established without applying this Article, this Article shall not be applied for the purpose of establishing entitlement to disability benefits or survivors’ benefits (except the lump-sum payments equivalent to the refund of contributions) based on the same insured event under the Japanese pension systems for employees.

####Calculation of the Amount of Benefits

2.  With regard to the Disability Basic Pension and other benefits, the amount of which is a fixed sum granted regardless of the period of coverage, if the requirements for receiving such benefits are fulfilled by virtue of paragraph 1 of Article 17 or paragraph 1 of Article 18, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of the sum of the periods of contribution and the premium-exempted periods under the pension system from which such benefits will be paid to the sum of those periods of contribution, those premium-exempted periods and the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Netherlands.   
3.  With regard to disability benefits and survivors’ benefits under the Japanese pension systems for employees, insofar as the amount of those benefits to be granted is calculated on the basis of the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan when the periods of coverage under those systems are less than that specified period, if the requirements for receiving such benefits are fulfilled by virtue of paragraph 1 of Article 17 or paragraph 1 of Article 18, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of the periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees to the sum of the periods of coverage and the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Netherlands. However, when the sum of the periods of coverage exceeds that specified period, that sum of the periods of coverage shall be regarded as equal to that specified period.   
4.  With regard to the calculation of the amount of benefits under the Japanese pension systems for employees in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, if the person entitled to the benefits possesses periods of coverage under two or more such pension systems, the periods of contribution under the pension system from which such benefits will be paid referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article or the periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be the sum of the periods of coverage under all such pension systems. However, when the sum of the periods of coverage equals or exceeds the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan within the meaning of paragraph 3 of this Article, the method of calculation stipulated in paragraph 3 of this Article and this paragraph shall not apply.   
5.  With regard to the Additional Pension for Spouses which is included in the Old-age Employees’ Pension and any other benefits that may be granted as a fixed sum in cases where the periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees equal or exceed the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan, if the requirements for receiving such benefits are fulfilled by virtue of paragraph 1 of Article 17, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of those periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees from which such benefits will be paid to that specified period.   

### Article  20  

####Period of Coverage

In applying the provisions of Articles 17 to 19, notwithstanding of paragraph 1(g) of Article 1, periods of coverage which are credited under the legislation of the Netherlands solely on the basis of residence in the territory of the Netherlands shall not be taken into account.

Indien het recht op arbeidsongeschiktheidsuitkeringen of nabestaandenuitkeringen (met uitzondering van lumpsum betalingen gelijk aan de terugbetaling van premies of bijdragen) uit hoofde van het nationaal pensioen wordt vastgesteld zonder toepassing van dit artikel, wordt dit artikel niet toegepast voor het vaststellen van het recht op arbeidsongeschiktheidsuitkeringen of nabestaandenuitkeringen (met uitzondering van lumpsum betalingen gelijk aan de terugbetaling van premies of bijdragen) op grond van dezelfde verzekerde gebeurtenis krachtens de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers.   
2.  Bij de toepassing van het eerste lid van dit artikel op een persoon die verzekeringstijdvakken heeft vervuld krachtens twee of meer Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers, wordt geacht in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van Japan aan de in dat lid bedoelde voorwaarde voor een van deze pensioenregelingen te zijn voldaan.

2.  Ten aanzien van het basispensioen voor arbeidsongeschiktheid en andere uitkeringen, die bestaan uit een vast bedrag dat ongeacht het verzekeringstijdvak wordt toegekend, indien aan de voorwaarden voor het ontvangen van deze uitkeringen krachtens artikel 17, eerste lid, of artikel 18, eerste lid, is voldaan, wordt het toe te kennen bedrag berekend naar rato van het totaal van de tijdvakken van betaling van premie of bijdrage en de tijdvakken van vrijstelling van betaling van premie of bijdrage krachtens de pensioenregeling op grond waarvan deze uitkeringen zullen worden betaald tot het totaal van deze tijdvakken van betaling van premie of bijdrage, deze tijdvakken van vrijstelling van betaling van premie of bijdrage en de verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de wetgeving van Nederland.   
3.  Ten aanzien van arbeidsongeschiktheidsuitkeringen en nabestaandenuitkeringen krachtens de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers, voor zover het bedrag van de toe te kennen uitkeringen wordt berekend op grond van het in de wetgeving van Japan bepaalde tijdvak, wanneer de verzekeringstijdvakken uit hoofde van die regelingen korter zijn dan dat omschreven tijdvak, indien aan de voorwaarden voor het ontvangen van deze uitkeringen wordt voldaan uit hoofde van artikel 17, eerste lid, of artikel 18, eerste lid, wordt het toe te kennen bedrag berekend naar rato van de verzekeringstijdvakken uit hoofde van de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers tot het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken en de verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de wetgeving van Nederland. Wanneer het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken het omschreven tijdvak evenwel overschrijdt, wordt het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken aangemerkt als zijnde gelijk aan dat omschreven tijdvak.   
4.  Voor de berekening van het bedrag van uitkeringen uit hoofde van Japanse pensioenregelingen voor medewerkers in overeenstemming met het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel, indien de gerechtigde tot de uitkeringen verzekeringstijdvakken heeft vervuld krachtens twee of meer van deze pensioenregelingen, vormen de tijdvakken van betaling van premie of bijdrage krachtens de pensioenregeling waaruit de uitkeringen worden betaald bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel of de verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel, het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken uit hoofde van al deze pensioenregelingen. Wanneer het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken evenwel gelijk is aan of hoger dan het in de wetgeving van Japan omschreven tijdvak in de zin van het derde lid van dit artikel, zijn de in het derde lid en in dit lid van dit artikel omschreven berekeningsmethodes niet van toepassing.   
5.  Wat betreft het aanvullend pensioen voor echtgenoten dat deel uitmaakt van het ouderdomspensioen voor werknemers en andere uitkeringen die als een vast bedrag kunnen worden toegekend in gevallen waarin de verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers gelijk zijn aan of hoger dan het door de wetgeving van Japan bepaalde tijdvak, indien voldaan wordt aan de voorwaarden voor het ontvangen van dergelijke uitkeringen uit hoofde van artikel 17, eerste lid, wordt het toe te kennen bedrag berekend naar rato van deze verzekeringstijdvakken krachtens de Japanse pensioenregelingen voor werknemers waaruit dergelijke uitkeringen voor dat omschreven tijdvak zullen worden betaald.
