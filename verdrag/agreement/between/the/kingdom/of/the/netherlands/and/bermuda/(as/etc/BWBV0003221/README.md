####Protocol between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Bermuda (as authorised by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) concerning the interpretation and application of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Bermuda (as authorised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) on the exchange of information with respect to taxes

Whereas the Kingdom of the Netherlands recognises the commitment the Government of Bermuda made to the OECD in 2000 to respect the principles of transparency and exchange of information and the Netherlands considers that this Agreement demonstrates Bermuda’s commitment to high standards for effective exchange of information with respect to both criminal and civil taxation matters; Whereas the Kingdom of the Netherlands also recognises the progressive steps that Bermuda has taken to demonstrate its commitment to high standards for effective exchange of information with respect to both criminal and civil taxation matters in negotiation of Tax Information Exchange Agreements with other countries and recognises that Bermuda is committed to combating tax abuse by putting in place mechanisms which enhance transparency; for example, the proactive steps taken to amend Bermuda’s domestic legislation for the purpose of fulfilling this Agreement and upon entering into the Agreement, the Kingdom of the Netherlands does not consider Bermuda to be engaging in any harmful tax practises and thus is not referred to as a tax haven;   Desiring to facilitate the exchange of information with respect to taxes, have further agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

####(Article 5(7)(e) )

With respect to subparagraph e of paragraph 7 of Article 5 it is understood that the term “pursued all means available in its own territory” includes the requesting Contracting Party using exchange of information mechanisms it has in force with any third country in which the information is located.  

### Article  2  

####(Article 5 )

If personal data is exchanged under the Agreement, the following additional provisions shall apply: 

a) The receiving authority may use such data only for the stated purpose and shall be subject to the conditions prescribed by the supplying authority; such use is also permitted, subject to the written consent required under Article 8, for the prevention and prosecution of serious crimes and for the purpose of addressing serious threats to public security;  

b) The receiving authority shall on request inform the supplying authority about the use of the supplied data and the results achieved thereby;  

c) Personal data may be supplied only to the responsible agencies. Any subsequent supply to other agencies may be effected only with the prior approval of the supplying authority;  

d) The supplying authority shall be obliged to take all reasonable care to ensure that the data to be supplied are accurate and that they are necessary for and proportionate to the purpose for which they are supplied. Any bans on data supply prescribed under applicable domestic law shall be observed. If it emerges that inaccurate data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied, the receiving authority shall be informed of this without delay. That authority shall be obliged to correct or erase such data without delay;  

e) Upon application the person concerned shall be informed of the supplied data relating to him and of the use to which such data are to be put. There shall be no obligation to furnish this information if on balance it turns out that the public interest in withholding it outweighs the interest of the person concerned in receiving it. In all other respects, the right of the person concerned to be informed of the existing data relating to him shall be governed by the domestic law of the Contracting State in whose sovereign territory the application for the information is made;  

f) The receiving authority shall bear liability in accordance with its domestic laws in relation to any person suffering unlawful damage as a result of supply of data pursuant to this Agreement. In relation to the damaged person, the receiving authority may not plead in its defence that the damage had been caused by the supplying argency;  

g) If the domestic law of the supplying authority provided, with respect to the personal data supplied, for erasure within a certain period of time that authority shall inform the receiving authority accordingly. Irrespective of such periods, supplied personal data shall be erased once they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were supplied;  

h) The supplying and the receiving authority shall be obliged to keep official records of the supply and receipt of personal data;  

i) The supplying and the receiving authority shall be obliged to take effective measures to protect the personal data supplied against unauthorised access, unauthorised alteration and unauthorised disclosure.    

### Article  3  

####(Article 12 )

In the event that a Contracting Party applies prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices to residents or nationals of the other Contracting Party, either Contracting Party may immediately initiate Competent Authority proceedings to resolve the matter. A prejudicial or restrictive measure based on harmful tax practices is a measure applied by one Contracting Party to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party on the basis that any one or more of the following applies: 

a) the other Contracting Party does not engage in effective exchange of information;  

b) because it lacks transparency in the operation of its laws, regulations or administrative practices; or,  

c) on the basis of no or nominal taxes.   Without limiting the generality of the term, “prejudicial or restrictive measure” is not limited solely to taxation matters and includes the denial of a deduction, credit or exemption, the imposition of a tax, charge or levy, or special reporting requirements, but does not include any generally applicable measure, applied by either Contracting Party against, amongst others, members of the OECD generally.  

### Article  4  

In the light of the experience of operating the Agreement, or to reflect changing circumstances, either Government may wish to propose a variation in the terms of this Agreement. If so, it is understood the other Government will agree to hold timely discussions with a view to revising the terms of the Agreement. 

a) The competent authorities may initiate discussions in case: 

(i) the Kingdom of the Netherlands enters into an agreement with another jurisdiction comparable to Bermuda which provides for other forms of exchange of information;  

(ii) Bermuda enters into an agreement with another jurisdiction which provides for other forms of exchange of information;  

(iii) Bermuda introduces new legislation which enables other forms of exchange of information.    

b. If the Kingdom of the Netherlands enters into arrangements with another jurisdiction comparable to Bermuda for the provision of information with respect to taxes that are less burdensome in any material respect than the provisions of the Agreement, Bermuda may initiate discussions with the Netherlands with a view to modifying the Agreement to have similar effect.    

### Article  5  

This Protocol shall form an integral part of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Bermuda (as authorised by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) on the exchange of information with respect to taxes, and shall enter into force on the same date as the Agreement.  

### Article  6  

The Contracting Parties may, by mutual arrangement, amend this Protocol at any time in writing. Such amendment shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after the States have notified each other in writing through diplomatic channels that the constitutional or internal requirements for the entry into force of this Protocol have been complied with.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised in that behalf by the respective Contracting Parties, have signed this Protocol. DONE at London this 8 <sup>th</sup> day of June 2009, in duplicate, in the English language.  *For the Kingdom of the Netherlands,*  J.C. DE JAGER  *For Bermuda,*  PAULA A. COX

De uitdrukking „relevant” indien gebezigd in dit Verdrag in verband met informatie wordt zodanig uitgelegd dat gewaarborgd wordt dat informatie relevant wordt geacht, ook als de relevantie van de informatie ter zake van een lopend onderzoek pas definitief kan worden vastgesteld na ontvangst van die informatie.   
3.  Wat betreft de toepassing, op enig moment, van dit Verdrag door een verdragsluitende partij, heeft, tenzij de context anders vereist, elke daarin niet omschreven uitdrukking de betekenis welke die uitdrukking op dat tijdstip heeft volgens de wetgeving van die partij, waarbij elke betekenis volgens de toepasselijke belastingwetgeving van die partij prevaleert boven een betekenis die volgens andere wetgeving van die partij aan die uitdrukking wordt gegeven.   
4.  Het commentaar bij het OESO-modelverdrag tot uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingzaken is van toepassing op de uitlegging van dit Verdrag waar dit Verdrag overeenstemt met het OESO-modelverdrag tot uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingzaken.   

### Artikel  5  

####Uitwisseling van informatie op verzoek

1.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij verstrekt op verzoek informatie ten behoeve van de in artikel 1 bedoelde doeleinden. Dergelijke informatie wordt uitgewisseld ongeacht of de onderzochte gedragingen, indien deze in de aangezochte partij zouden plaatsvinden, uit hoofde van de wetgeving van de aangezochte partij als strafbaar feit zouden worden aangemerkt.   
2.  Indien de informatie in het bezit van de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij niet toereikend is om aan het verzoek om informatie te voldoen, treft die partij alle toepasselijke maatregelen ten behoeve van het verzamelen van informatie teneinde de verzoekende partij de verzochte informatie te verstrekken, ongeacht het feit dat de aangezochte partij ten behoeve van haar eigen belastingheffing niet over dergelijke informatie hoeft te beschikken.   
3.  Indien de bevoegde autoriteit van een verzoekende partij daar specifiek om verzoekt, is de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij gehouden uit hoofde van dit artikel informatie te verstrekken, voor zover zulks is toegestaan in overeenstemming met haar nationale wetgeving, in de vorm van getuigenverklaringen en gewaarmerkte afschriften van originele stukken.   
4.  Elke verdragsluitende partij waarborgt dat haar bevoegde autoriteit voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag over de bevoegdheid beschikt op verzoek het navolgende te verkrijgen en te verstrekken: 

a. informatie die berust bij banken, overige financiële instellingen en personen die bij wijze van vertegenwoordiging of als vertrouwenspersoon optreden, met inbegrip van gevolmachtigden en trustees;  

b. informatie met betrekking tot de juridische en feitelijke eigendom van lichamen, samenwerkingsverbanden, trusts, stichtingen, „Anstalten” en andere personen, met inbegrip van, binnen de beperkingen van artikel 2, informatie inzake de eigendom met betrekking tot al deze personen binnen een eigendomsketen; in het geval van trusts, informatie met betrekking tot instellers, trustees, begunstigden en de positie in een eigendomsketen; en in het geval van stichtingen, informatie met betrekking tot stichters, leden van het bestuur en begunstigden.     
5.  Dit Verdrag schept geen verplichting voor de verdragsluitende partijen tot het verkrijgen of verstrekken van: 

i. informatie met betrekking tot de eigendom van beursgenoteerde ondernemingen of openbare collectieve beleggingsfondsen of regelingen, tenzij deze informatie zonder onevenredige moeilijkheden kan worden verkregen;  

ii. informatie met betrekking tot een tijdvak dat meer dan zes jaar ligt voor het onderhavige belastingtijdvak;  

iii. informatie, tenzij de verzoekende partij op haar eigen grondgebied alles in het werk heeft gesteld om de informatie te verkrijgen, tenzij dit zou leiden tot onevenredige moeilijkheden;  

iv. informatie in het bezit of in de macht van een persoon niet zijnde de belastingbetaler die niet direct betrekking heeft op de belastingbetaler.     
6.  Indien de verzoekende partij in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag om informatie verzoekt, verklaart een hogere functionaris van de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij dat het verzoek relevant en noodzakelijk is voor het vaststellen van de door de belastingbetaler verschuldigde belasting ingevolge de wetgeving van de verzoekende partij.   
7.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij verstrekt de volgende informatie aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij wanneer de eerstgenoemde partij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag een verzoek om informatie doet, teneinde aan te tonen dat de verlangde informatie relevant is voor het verzoek: 

a. de identiteit van de belastingbetaler op wie de controle of het onderzoek betrekking heeft;  

b. gronden om aan te nemen dat de verzochte informatie in het bezit is van of in de macht van een persoon onder de rechtsmacht van de aangezochte partij;  

c. de naam en adresgegevens, voor zover bekend, van personen van wie verondersteld wordt dat zij in het bezit zijn van of kunnen beschikken over de verzochte informatie;  

d. een verklaring dat het verzoek in overeenstemming is met de wetgeving en bestuursrechtelijke praktijk van de verzoekende partij en ingevolge haar wetgeving door de verzoekende partij onder vergelijkbare omstandigheden te verkrijgen zou zijn, zowel voor de toepassing van haar eigen belastingwetgeving als naar aanleiding van een geldig verzoek van de aangezochte partij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag;  

e. een verklaring dat de verzoekende partij op haar eigen grondgebied alles in het werk heeft gesteld om de informatie te verkrijgen, tenzij dit zou leiden tot onevenredige moeilijkheden;   en in de ruimst mogelijke mate: 

f. de aard van en het soort verzochte informatie, met inbegrip van een beschrijving van de specifieke bewijzen, informatie of andere bijstand waarom verzocht wordt en de vorm waarin de verzoekende partij de informatie bij voorkeur wenst te ontvangen;  

g. de belastingdoeleinden waarvoor om de informatie wordt verzocht en waarom deze relevant is voor het vaststellen van de ingevolge de wetgeving van de verzoekende partij door een belastingbetaler verschuldigde belasting;  

i. het tijdvak ter zake waarvan om de informatie voor belastingdoeleinden wordt verzocht.     
8.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij doet de verzochte informatie zo spoedig mogelijk toekomen aan de verzoekende partij. Teneinde een snel antwoord te waarborgen: 

a. bevestigt de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij de ontvangst van een verzoek schriftelijk aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij en stelt zij de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij binnen 60 dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek in kennis van eventuele gebreken in het verzoek.  

b. stelt de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij indien zij niet in staat is de informatie binnen 90 dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek te verkrijgen en te verstrekken, onder meer omdat zij belemmeringen ondervindt bij het verstrekken van de informatie dan wel weigert de informatie te verstrekken, stelt zij de verzoekende partij daarvan onverwijld op de hoogte, onder vermelding van de oorzaken van de onmogelijkheid, de aard van de belemmeringen of de redenen voor haar weigering.     

### Artikel  6  

####Belastingcontrole in het buitenland

1.  Voor zover toegestaan ingevolge haar nationale recht kan de aangezochte partij vertegenwoordigers van de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij toestaan het grondgebied van de aangezochte partij binnen te komen teneinde natuurlijke personen te ondervragen en met schriftelijke toestemming van de betrokken personen stukken te onderzoeken. De bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij stelt de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij in kennis van het tijdstip en de locatie van de bijeenkomst met de betrokken natuurlijke personen.   
2.  Op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij kan de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij vertegenwoordigers van de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij toestaan aanwezig te zijn bij het daarvoor in aanmerking komende deel van een belastingcontrole in de aangezochte partij.   
3.  Indien het in het tweede lid bedoelde verzoek wordt ingewilligd, stelt de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij die de controle uitvoert, de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende partij zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis van het tijdstip en de locatie van de controle, de autoriteit of functionaris die de controle zal uitvoeren en van de procedures en voorwaarden die bij de aangezochte partij vereist zijn voor de uitvoering van de controle. Alle beslissingen met betrekking tot het uitvoeren van de belastingcontrole worden genomen door de aangezochte partij die de controle uitvoert.   

### Artikel  7  

####Mogelijkheid een verzoek af te wijzen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij kan weigeren bijstand te verlenen: 

a. indien het verzoek niet is gedaan in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag;  

b. indien de verzoekende partij de informatie niet zou kunnen verkrijgen 

i. ingevolge haar eigen wetgeving ten behoeve van de toepassing of handhaving van haar eigen belastingwetgeving; of  

ii. naar aanleiding van een geldig verzoek van de aangezochte partij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag.       
2.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag mogen een verdragsluitende partij niet verplichten informatie te verstrekken waardoor een handelsgeheim, zakelijk geheim, industrieel, commercieel of beroepsgeheim of handelsproces zou worden onthuld. Niettegenstaande het voorgaande, zal de informatie bedoeld in artikel 5, vierde lid, niet als geheim of handelsproces worden behandeld uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat zij aan de in dat lid gestelde criteria voldoet.   
3.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag mogen een verdragsluitende partij niet verplichten informatie te verkrijgen of te verstrekken waardoor vertrouwelijke communicatie tussen een cliënt en een advocaat of een andere erkende juridische vertegenwoordiger zou worden onthuld indien dergelijke communicatie onderworpen is aan de bescherming van de vertrouwelijkheid ingevolge de in de aangezochte partij van kracht zijnde wetgeving.   
4.  De aangezochte partij kan een verzoek om informatie afwijzen indien openbaarmaking van de informatie in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde (ordre public).   
5.  Een verzoek om informatie wordt niet geweigerd op grond van het feit dat de belastingvordering die aanleiding gaf tot het verzoek wordt betwist.   
6.  De aangezochte partij kan een verzoek om informatie afwijzen indien de informatie door de verzoekende partij wordt gevraagd om een bepaling van de belastingwetgeving van de verzoekende partij toe te passen of te handhaven die, of een daarmee verband houdend vereiste dat, discriminatie inhoudt van een onderdaan van de aangezochte partij ten opzichte van een onderdaan van de verzoekende partij die zich in dezelfde omstandigheden bevindt.   

### Artikel  8  

####Vertrouwelijkheid

Alle uit hoofde van dit Verdrag door een verdragsluitende partij ontvangen informatie wordt vertrouwelijk behandeld en wordt uitsluitend ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (met inbegrip van rechterlijke en bestuursrechtelijke instanties) die onder de rechtsmacht van de desbetreffende verdragsluitende partij vallen en betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of inning van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen uitsluitend voor deze doeleinden van deze informatie gebruikmaken. Zij mogen de informatie bekendmaken in openbare rechtszittingen of in gerechtelijke beslissingen. De informatie mag niet ter kennis worden gebracht van enige andere persoon, instelling, autoriteit of rechterlijke instantie zonder de uitdrukkelijke schriftelijke toestemming van de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte partij.  

### Artikel  9

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekenden, daartoe naar behoren gemachtigd, het Verdrag hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN in tweevoud te Londen op 8 juni 2009, in de Engelse taal.  *Voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,*  J. C. DE JAGER  *Voor Bermuda,*  PAULA A. COX  

####Protocol tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Bermuda (zoals gemachtigd door de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittanië en Noord-Ierland) betreffende de uitlegging en toepassing van het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Bermuda (zoals gemachtigd door het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland) inzake de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen

Overwegend dat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden erkent dat de Regering van Bermuda zich jegens de OESO in 2000 verplicht heeft de beginselen van transparantie en de uitwisseling van informatie te eerbiedigen en Nederland meent dat dit Verdrag aantoont dat Bermuda bereid is strenge normen te hanteren voor de doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie ter zake van zowel strafrechtelijke als civielrechtelijke fiscale aangelegenheden; Overwegend dat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden voorts de geleidelijke maatregelen erkent die Bermuda heeft genomen als blijk van zijn bereidheid tot het hanteren van strenge normen voor de doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie ter zake van zowel strafrechtelijke als civielrechtelijke fiscale aangelegenheden bij het onderhandelen over verdragen tot uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingzaken met andere landen en erkent dat Bermuda zich heeft verplicht belastingfraude te bestrijden door mechanismen in werking te stellen ter bevordering van de transparantie, waaronder de proactieve maatregelen die zijn genomen tot aanpassing van zijn nationale wetgeving teneinde aan dit Verdrag te voldoen; bij het sluiten van het Verdrag meent het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden dat Bermuda niet betrokken is bij schadelijke fiscale praktijken en derhalve niet wordt aangemerkt als een belastingparadijs;   Geleid door de wens de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen te vergemakkelijken, zijn voorts het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

####(Artikel 5, zevende lid, onderdeel e )

Wat artikel 5, zevende lid, onderdeel e, betreft is het wel te verstaan dat onder de uitdrukking „op haar eigen grondgebied alles in het werk heeft gesteld” mede wordt begrepen dat de verzoekende verdragsluitende partij gebruikmaakt van de mechanismen voor de uitwisseling van informatie die van kracht zijn met derde landen waar de informatie zich bevindt.  

### Artikel  2  

####(Artikel 5 )

Indien uit hoofde van het Verdrag persoonsgegevens worden uitgewisseld zijn de volgende aanvullende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a. De ontvangende autoriteit mag dergelijke gegevens uitsluitend gebruiken voor het opgegeven doel en wel onder de door de verstrekkende autoriteit gestelde voorwaarden; dergelijk gebruik is eveneens toegestaan na de ingevolge artikel 8 vereiste schriftelijke toestemming ter voorkoming en vervolging van ernstige delicten en ten behoeve van de bestrijding van ernstige bedreigingen voor de openbare veiligheid;  

b. Op verzoek stelt de ontvangende autoriteit de verstrekkende autoriteit in kennis van het gebruik van de verstrekte gegevens en de resultaten die ermee bereikt zijn;  

c. Persoonsgegevens mogen verder uitsluitend aan de verantwoordelijke instanties worden verstrekt. Persoonsgegevens mogen uitsluitend aan andere instanties worden doorgegeven na voorafgaande toestemming van de verstrekkende autoriteit;  

d. De verstrekkende autoriteit is verplicht alle redelijke zorg te betrachten om te waarborgen dat de te verstrekken gegevens correct zijn, en dat zij nodig zijn voor en in verhouding staan tot het doel waarvoor zij worden verstrekt. Alle verboden ter zake van de verstrekking van gegevens krachtens de van toepassing zijnde wetgeving dienen te worden geëerbiedigd. Indien blijkt dat onjuiste gegevens zijn verstrekt of dat er gegevens zijn verstrekt die niet verstrekt hadden mogen worden, dient de ontvangende autoriteit hiervan overwijld in kennis te worden gesteld. De ontvangende autoriteit is verplicht dergelijke gegevens onverwijld te corrigeren of te vernietigen;  

e. Op aanvraag wordt de betrokken persoon geïnformeerd over de verstrekte gegevens die op hem betrekking hebben en over het doel waarvoor zij worden verstrekt. Deze informatie behoeft niet te worden verstrekt indien na afweging blijkt dat het openbaar belang bij niet-verstrekken zwaarder weegt dan het belang dat betrokken persoon heeft bij het ontvangen ervan. In alle overige opzichten is op het recht van betrokken persoon te worden geïnformeerd over de bestaande gegevens over hem het nationale recht van toepassing van de verdragsluitende staat op wier soeverein grondgebied de aanvraag om informatie wordt gedaan;  

f. De ontvangende autoriteit is in overeenstemming met zijn nationale recht aansprakelijk jegens elke persoon die wederrechtelijk schade lijdt ten gevolge van het verstrekken van gegevens uit hoofde van dit Verdrag. Jegens de persoon die schade heeft geleden mag de ontvangende autoriteit ter verdediging niet aanvoeren dat de schade is veroorzaakt door de verstrekkende instantie;  

g. Indien het nationale recht van de verstrekkende autoriteit ter zake van de verstrekte persoonsgegevens voorziet in vernietiging binnen een bepaalde termijn, dient deze autoriteit de ontvangende autoriteit daarvan op de hoogte te stellen. Ongeacht dergelijke termijnen dienen verstrekte persoonsgegevens te worden vernietigd zodra zij niet langer nodig zijn voor het doel waarvoor zij zijn verstrekt;  

h. De verstrekkende en de ontvangende autoriteit zijn verplicht het verstrekken en ontvangen van persoonsgevens officieel te registreren;  

i. De verstrekkende en de ontvangende autoriteit zijn verplicht doeltreffende maatregelen te nemen ter bescherming van verstrekte persoonsgegevens tegen toegang of wijziging door en bekendmaking aan onbevoegden.    

### Artikel  3  

####(Artikel 12 )

Indien een verdragsluitende partij gebaseerd op schadelijke fiscale praktijken, nadelige of beperkende maatregelen toepast op inwoners of onderdanen van de andere verdragsluitende partij, kan de andere verdragsluitende partij onverwijld een procedure voor onderling overleg starten ten behoeve van een oplossing. Een nadelige of beperkende maatregel gebaseerd op schadelijke fiscale praktijken is een maatregel die de ene verdragsluitende partij toepast op inwoners of onderdanen van de andere verdragsluitende partij waarbij het volgende geldt: 

a. de andere verdragsluitende partij neemt geen deel aan een doeltreffende uitwisseling van informatie;  

b. er sprake is van een gebrek aan transparantie bij de uitvoering van haar wet- of regelgeving of bestuursrechtelijke praktijken; of  

c. de maatregel wordt zonder belastinggrondslag of op grond van minieme belastingen genomen.   Zonder het algemene karakter van de uitdrukking te beperken is de uitdrukking „nadelige of beperkende maatregel” niet alleen beperkt tot fiscale aangelegenheden en omvat zij mede het weigeren van aftrek, verrekening of vrijstelling, het opleggen van een belasting of heffing, of bijzondere rapportagevereisten; zij omvat niet de algemeen toepasselijke maatregelen die door een van de verdragsluitende partijen in het algemeen worden opgelegd aan onder meer leden van de OESO.  

### Artikel  4  

Op grond van ervaringen met de werking van het Verdrag of van veranderende omstandigheden kan elk van de regeringen een aanpassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag voorstellen. Indien zulks het geval is, is het wel te verstaan dat de andere regering instemt met tijdig overleg teneinde de bepalingen van het Verdrag te herzien. 

a. De bevoegde autoriteiten kunnen in overleg treden indien: 

i. het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden een verdrag sluit met een andere, met Bermuda vergelijkbare mogendheid dat voorziet in andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie;  

ii. Bermuda een verdrag sluit met een andere mogendheid dat voorziet in andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie;  

iii. Bermuda nieuwe wetgeving invoert die andere vormen van uitwisseling van informatie mogelijk maakt.    

b. Indien het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden met een andere met Bermuda vergelijkbare mogendheid regelingen treft voor het verstrekken van informatie ter zake van belastingen die in materieel opzicht minder belastend zijn dan de bepalingen van het Verdrag, kan Bermuda met Nederland in overleg treden teneinde het Verdrag dienovereenkomstig aan te passen.    

### Artikel  5  

Dit Protocol vormt een integrerend onderdeel van het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Bermuda (zoals gemachtigd door de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland) inzake de uitwisseling van informatie betreffende belastingen en treedt in werking op dezelfde datum als het Verdrag.  

### Artikel  6  

De verdragsluitende partijen kunnen dit Protocol te allen tijde in onderling overleg schriftelijk wijzigen. Een dergelijke wijziging treedt in werking op de eerste dag van de tweede maand nadat de staten elkaar langs diplomatieke weg schriftelijk ervan in kennis hebben gesteld dat aan de grondwettelijke of interne vereisten voor de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol is voldaan.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekenden, daartoe naar behoren gemachtigd door de respectieve verdragsluitende partijen, dit Protocol hebben ondertekend.
