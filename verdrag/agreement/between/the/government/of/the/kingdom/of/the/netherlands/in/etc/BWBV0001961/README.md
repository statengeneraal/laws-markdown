1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten wisselen gegevens uit ten behoeve van de uitvoering en handhaving van de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten ter zake van belastingen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is, met inbegrip van gegevens ter bepaling, vaststelling en inning van belasting, de invordering en tenuitvoerlegging van belastingvorderingen of onderzoek naar of vervolging van belastingdelicten of delicten waarbij inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de belastingwetgeving.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat verstrekt op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende Staat gegevens ten behoeve van de in het eerste lid aangegeven doeleinden. Indien de in de belastingadministratie van de aangezochte Staat beschikbare gegevens niet voldoende zijn om aan het verzoek te kunnen voldoen, treft die Staat alle ter zake dienende maatregelen, waaronder dwangmaatregelen, om de verzoekende Staat de verzochte gegevens te verstrekken.

3.  De aangezochte Staat verstrekt de ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel verzochte gegevens ongeacht of de aangezochte Staat deze gegevens ten behoeve van zijn eigen belasting nodig heeft. Bovendien is de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat, op specifiek verzoek van de verzoekende Staat, gehouden: 

a. de tijd en plaats aan te geven voor het afnemen van de verklaring of de overlegging van boeken, papieren, stukken en andere zaken;  

b. de natuurlijke persoon die een verklaring aflegt of boeken, papieren, stukken en andere zaken overlegt, onder ede te plaatsen;  

c. de aanwezigheid toe te staan van natuurlijke personen die door de bevoegde autoriteit worden aangemerkt als zijnde betrokken bij of getroffen door de uitvoering van het verzoek, met inbegrip van een verdachte, een raadsman voor de verdachte, natuurlijke personen die belast zijn met de tenuitvoerlegging en handhaving van de nationale wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is en een gevolmachtigde of magistraat aanwezig ten behoeve van uitspraken inzake bewijskracht of het nemen van beslissingen ten aanzien van voorrechten ingevolge de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat;  

d. natuurlijke personen die aanwezig mogen zijn de gelegenheid te bieden, rechtstreeks of via het uitvoerend orgaan, de natuurlijke persoon die een verklaring aflegt of die boeken, papieren, stukken en andere zaken overlegt, te ondervragen;  

e. originele en ongeredigeerde boeken, papieren, stukken en andere zaken veilig te stellen;

j. elke andere handeling te verrichten die niet in strijd is met de wetgeving of de bestuurlijke praktijk van de aangezochte Staat;  

k. te verklaren dat de door de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende Staat verlangde procedures zijn gevolgd dan wel dat de verlangde procedures niet konden worden gevolgd, met uitleg van de afwijking en de reden daarvan.     
4.  De bepalingen van de voorgaande leden mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat voor een Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichting ontstaat: 

a. bestuurlijke maatregelen uit te voeren die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving en bestuurlijke praktijk van die Staat of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

b. bepaald informatiemateriaal te verstrekken dat op grond van de wetgeving of de normale bestuurspraktijk van die Staat of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat niet kan worden verkregen;

Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande volzin bevindt een onderdaan van de verzoekende Staat die belastingplichtig is in verband met wereldwijd vergaard inkomen zich niet in dezelfde omstandigheden als een onderdaan van de aangezochte Staat die niet belastingplichtig is in verband met wereldwijd vergaard inkomen. De bepalingen van dit onderdeel mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat hierdoor de uitwisseling van gegevens wordt voorkomen met betrekking tot de door de Verenigde Staten geheven belasting op winsten uit vaste inrichtingen of op het premie-inkomen van verzekeraars die niet in de Verenigde Staten gevestigd zijn of buitenlandse verzekeringsmaatschappijen, of op enige soortgelijke belastingen die in de toekomst door de Nederlandse Antillen worden geheven;  

f. niettegenstaande de onderdelen a) tot en met e) van dit lid is de aangezochte Staat gerechtigd via zijn bevoegde autoriteit gegevens te verkrijgen en te verstrekken die berusten bij financiële instellingen, gevolmachtigden of personen die als vertegenwoorder optreden of fiduciaire handelingen verrichten (niet omvattende gegevens waardoor vertrouwelijke communicatie zou worden onthuld tussen een cliënt en een advocaat of een andere juridische vertegenwoordiger wanneer de cliënt om juridisch advies vraagt), of gegevens met betrekking tot het eigen vermogen van een persoon.     
5.  Behoudens het bepaalde in het vierde lid worden de bepalingen van de voorgaande leden zodanig uitgelegd dat op een Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichting rust een verzoek naar beste kunnen uit te voeren en hierbij alle wettige middelen te gebruiken. Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan, naar eigen goeddunken, maatregelen nemen ter verkrijging van en verzending naar de andere Staat van gegevens die hij ingevolge het vierde lid niet verplicht is te verzenden.   
6.  De bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat staat vertegenwoordigers van de verzoekende Staat toe de aangezochte Staat binnen te komen om natuurlijke personen te horen en met de instemming van de desbetreffende natuurlijke personen boeken en stukken te onderzoeken.   
7.  Alle gegevens die door een Verdragsluitende Staat worden ontvangen wordt als geheim behandeld op dezelfde wijze als gegevens die krachtens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat worden verkregen en worden uitsluitend onthuld aan natuurlijke personen of autoriteiten (met inbegrip van rechterlijke en bestuurlijke instanties) die betrokken zijn bij de bepaling, aanslag, inning en de administratie van, het verhaal en de inning van vorderingen afgeleid van, de handhaving of vervolging met betrekking tot, of de beoordeling van beroepen ten aanzien van, de belastingen die het voorwerp van dit Verdrag vormen, of bij het toezicht hierop. Deze natuurlijke personen of autoriteiten mogen alleen voor deze doeleinden van de gegevens gebruik maken. Zij mogen de gegevens bekendmaken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.   

### Artikel  5

2.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. De bevoegde autoriteiten kunnen in het bijzonder een gemeenschappelijke betekenis van een term overeenkomen en kunnen bepalen wanneer kosten buitengewoon zijn voor de toepassing van artikel 6.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen voor het bereiken van overeenstemming ingevolge dit artikel rechtstreeks met elkaar in contact treden.
