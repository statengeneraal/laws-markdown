####Protocol to the Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on Promotion and Protection of Investment.

on the signing of the Agreement between the Goverment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Goverment of the Republic of Indonesia on promotion of investment, the undersigned representatives have agreed on the following provisions which constitute an integral part of the Agreement: 
### *With reference to Article III:* 

1. The Government of the Republic of Indonesia, while recognizing the principle of national treatment of investments made by nationals of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, reserves its right to maintain limited exceptions to national treatment of such investments in view of the fact that there are separate laws governing investments in Indonesia, i.e.: 

1. Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment.  

2. Law No. 6 of 1968 concerning Domestic Investment.   Notwithstanding the above statement, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia shall endeavour to the best of its ability to assure national treatment of investments of nationals of the Netherlands. In no case shall treatment of such investments be less favourable than law no. 1 of1967, as amended in 1970, permits. When, pursuant to present or subsequent legislation, the Indonesian Government, extends additional advantages to Indonesian nationals, the Indonesian Government shall, in order to ensure fair and equitable treatment, grant identical or compensating facilities to Netherlands nationals engaged in similar economic activities.  

2. With regard to the employment of foreign managerial, commercial or technical staff-personnel in an enterprise, in case such employment is subject to a licence according to the national legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which such enterprise will be established or is run, that Contracting Party will adopt a lenient attitude when deciding on applications for such licences, taking into account the importance of a just personnel-policy in the framework of the general management of an enterprise. 
### *With reference to Article VII* 

Contracting Parties may maintain laws and regulations requiring reports of currency transfer which do not restrict or delay the payments guaranteed under this Article.

2.  Indien een dergelijk geschil niet overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel kan worden beslecht binnen een tijdvak van drie maanden vanaf de datum waarop een van beide partijen bij het geschil om een minnelijke schikking heeft verzocht, wordt het geschil, op verzoek van de betrokken onderdaan, onderworpen aan hetzij door de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij voorziene gerechtelijke procedures, hetzij internationale arbitrage of conciliatie.   
3.  Onderwerping van een geschil aan nationale gerechtelijke procedures ingevolge het tweede lid van dit artikel doet op generlei wijze afbreuk aan het recht van de betrokken onderdaan het geschil aan internationale arbitrage of bemiddeling te onderwerpen.   
4.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij stemt bij deze ermee in juridische geschillen die ontstaan tussen die Verdragsluitende Partij en een onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij betreffende een investering van die onderdaan op het grondgebied van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij voor te leggen aan het Internationale Centrum voor Beslechting van Investeringsgeschillen ter beslechting door bemiddeling of arbitrage krachtens het Verdrag inzake de beslechting van investeringsgeschillen tussen Staten en onderdanen van andere Staten, dat op 18 maart 1965 te Washington werd opengesteld voor ondertekening.   
5.  Een rechtspersoon die, op de datum waarop de partijen instemden met onderwerping van het geschil aan bemiddeling of arbitrage, de nationaliteit bezat van de Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, maar die onder toezicht staat van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt voor de toepassing van het Verdrag van Washington behandeld als onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  X  

####Regeling van geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van het Verdrag

1.  Geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag die niet door middel van diplomatieke onderhandelingen kunnen worden beslecht, worden, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van één van beide Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Partij benoemt één scheidsman en de aldus benoemde scheidsmannen benoemen te zamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een der Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  Indien één van beide Partijen nalaat haar scheidsman te benoemen en indien zij geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere Partij binnen twee maanden tot deze benoeming over te gaan, kan de laatstbedoelde Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
3.  Indien de beide scheidsmannen niet binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming tot overeenstemming kunnen geraken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, kan elk der Partijen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
4.  Indien in de in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de Vice-President verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de Vice-President verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat het hoogst in anciënniteit is, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van één der Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van eerbiediging van het recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elke stand van het geding een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de Partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono, indien de Partijen daarmee instemmen.   
6.  Tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
7.  Het scheidsgerecht doet zijn uitspraak bij meerderheid van stemmen. Een zodanige uitspraak is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de Partijen.   

### Artikel  XI

### Artikel  XII  

####Toepassing van andere bepalingen

Indien de wettelijke bepalingen van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, of verplichtingen uit hoofde van het internationale recht die thans bestaan of hierna tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen worden aangegaan naast het onderhavige Verdrag, een regeling bevatten, ongeacht of deze algemeen dan wel specifiek is, waarbij investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij recht hebben op een behandeling die gunstiger is dan voorzien in dit Verdrag, heeft die regeling, voor zover ze gunstiger is, voorrang boven dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  XIII  

####Overleg en wijziging

1.  Elk der Verdragsluitende Partijen kan verzoeken om overleg over aangelegenheden betreffende dit Verdrag. De andere Partij neemt dit voorstel welwillend in overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor een dergelijk overleg.

####Protocol bij het Verdrag tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië inzake de bevordering en de bescherming van investeringen

Bij de ondertekening van het Verdrag tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië inzake de bevordering en de bescherming van investeringen zijn de ondergetekende vertegenwoordigers de volgende bepalingen overeengekomen, die een geïntegreerd onderdeel van het Verdrag vormen: 
###Met betrekking tot artikel III:

1. Hoewel de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië het beginsel van nationale behandeling van investeringen van onderdanen van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden erkent, behoudt zij zich het recht voor beperkte uitzonderingen te handhaven op de nationale behandeling van die investeringen gezien het feit dat er in Indonesië afzonderlijke wetten inzake investeringen bestaan, te weten: 

1. Wet nr. 1 van 1967 inzake Buitenlandse Investeringen.  

2. Wet nr. 6 van 1968 inzake Binnenlandse Investeringen.   Niettegenstaande bovenstaande verklaring zal de Regering van de Republiek Indonesië zich naar beste kunnen inspannen om nationale behandeling te verzekeren van investeringen van Nederlandse onderdanen. In geen geval zal de behandeling van die investeringen minder gunstig zijn dan toegestaan krachtens wet nr. 1 van 1967, zoals gewijzigd in 1970. Indien de Indonesische Regering ingevolge de huidige of toekomstige wetgeving bijkomende voordelen toekent aan Indonesische onderdanen, zal de Indonesische Regering, ter verzekering van eerlijke en billijke behandeling, dezelfde of compenserende faciliteiten toekennen aan Nederlandse onderdanen die soortgelijke economische activiteiten uitoefenen.  

2. Wat betreft de indienstneming van buitenlands leidinggevend, commercieel of technisch personeel in een onderneming, indien die indienstneming onderworpen is aan een vergunning volgens de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij op wier grondgebied die onderneming zal worden gevestigd of wordt geëxploiteerd, zal die Verdragsluitende Partij zich soepel opstellen bij het beslissen over aanvragen van dergelijke vergunningen, rekening houdend met het belang van een rechtvaardig personeelsbeleid in het kader van de algemene leiding van een onderneming.   
###Met betrekking tot artikel VII:

De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen wetten en voorschriften handhaven volgens welke melding moet worden gemaakt van overmaking van valuta, voor zover de krachtens dit artikel gewaarborgde betalingen hierdoor niet worden beperkt of vertraagd.
