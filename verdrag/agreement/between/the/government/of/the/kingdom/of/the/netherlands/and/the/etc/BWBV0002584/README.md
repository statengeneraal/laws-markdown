2.  Geen van de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel wordt geacht de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij het recht te geven tot deelneming aan luchtvervoer tussen punten gelegen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  3  

####Verandering van luchtvaartuig

1.  Elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan op iedere vlucht of op alle vluchten op overeengekomen diensten van luchtvaartuig veranderen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij of op enig punt langs de omschreven routes, mits: 

a. luchtvaartuigen die verder dan het punt waarop van luchtvaartuig wordt veranderd worden gebruikt, in aansluiting op de inkomende of uitgaande luchtvaartuigen in de dienstregeling worden opgenomen, naar gelang het geval,  

b. indien op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van luchtvaartuig wordt veranderd en wanneer verder dan het punt van verandering meer dan een luchtvaartuig wordt geëxploiteerd, ten hoogste één luchtvaartuig van gelijke grootte is als, en geen enkel luchtvaartuig groter is dan, het luchtvaartuig dat in derde en vierde-vrijheidssectoren wordt gebruikt.     
2.  Bij verandering van luchtvaartuig kan een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij gebruik maken van haar eigen uitrusting en, met inachtneming van de nationale voorschriften, van geleaste uitrusting, en zij kan daartoe commerciële overeenkomsten met een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij aangaan.   
3.  Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij kan verschillende of dezelfde vluchtnummers gebruiken voor de sectoren waarop haar verandering van luchtvaartuig betrekking heeft.   

### Artikel  4  

####Aanwijzing en verlening van vergunningen

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving langs diplomatieke weg aan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een luchtvaartmaatschappij aan te wijzen voor de exploitatie van luchtdiensten op de in de Bijlage omschreven routes en een eerder aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij te vervangen door een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij.   
2.  Na ontvangst van bedoelde kennisgeving verleent elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij onverwijld aan de aldus door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit artikel, de vereiste exploitatievergunningen.   
3.  Na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunning kan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij te allen tijde een aanvang maken met de gehele of gedeeltelijke exploitatie van de overeengekomen diensten, mits zij aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst voldoet en de tarieven voor deze diensten zijn vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 6 van deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft het recht de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde exploitatievergunning te weigeren of deze vergunning te verlenen onder noodzakelijk geachte voorwaarden ter zake van de uitoefening van de in artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst omschreven rechten door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij, indien niet te haren genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het daadwerkelijke toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen en/of bij haar onderdanen.   

### Artikel  5  

####Intrekking en opschorting van vergunningen

1.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij hebben het recht ten aanzien van een door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij de in artikel 4 bedoelde vergunningen niet te verlenen, deze vergunningen in te trekken of op te schorten of daaraan voorwaarden te verbinden: 

a. ingeval die luchtvaartmaatschappij in gebreke blijft ten genoegen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten van eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan te tonen dat zij voldoet aan de door die autoriteiten gewoonlijk en redelijkerwijs door in overeenstemming met het Verdrag toegepaste wetten en voorschriften;  

b. ingeval die luchtvaartmaatschappij in gebreke blijft de wetten en voorschriften van eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij na te leven;  

c. ingeval niet te haren genoegen is aangetoond dat een aanmerkelijk deel van de eigendom van, en het daadwerkelijk toezicht op die luchtvaartmaatschappij berusten bij de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft aangewezen en/of bij haar onderdanen; en  

d. indien die luchtvaartmaatschappij anderszins in gebreke blijft de exploitatie te voeren in overeenstemming met de in deze Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden.     
2.  Tenzij onmiddellijk ingrijpen van wezenlijk belang is ter voorkoming van verdere inbreuken op de hierboven bedoelde wetten en voorschriften, worden de in het eerste lid van dit artikel opgesomde rechten slechts uitgeoefend na overleg met de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Tenzij anders door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, vangt zulk overleg aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek ter zake.   

### Artikel  6  

####Tarieven

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen stemmen in met de toepassing van een regeling voor goedkeuring van het tarief door het land van oorsprong zoals vervat in de bepalingen van dit artikel.   
2.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij staat toe dat de tarieven voor luchtvervoer door elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij worden vastgesteld op basis van commerciële overwegingen ten aanzien van de marktsituatie en andere relevante factoren, met inbegrip van de exploitatiekosten en tarieven van andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen voor enig gedeelte van de omschreven route. Wanneer mogelijk worden tarieven overeengekomen tussen de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen.   
3.  De luchtvaartautoriteiten van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlenen geen goedkeuring aan tarieven voor luchtvervoer dat afkomstig is uit hun onderscheiden grondgebieden indien die tarieven: 

a. op onredelijke wijze discriminerend zijn wat prijzen en/of andere voorwaarden betreft;  

b. onredelijk hoog of beperkend zijn wegens misbruik van een overheersende positie en derhalve de belangen van consumenten schaden;  

c. kunstmatig laag zijn vanwege onder meer rechtstreekse of indirecte overheidssubsidie of -steun die gericht is op bescherming van de luchtvaartmaatschappij in kwestie.     
4.  Indien de luchtvaartautoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waaruit het luchtvervoer afkomstig is, van oordeel zijn dat een tarief niet in overeenstemming is met de in het tweede lid neergelegde beginselen en dat interventie vereist is, stellen zij de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij onmiddellijk daarvan in kennis. De luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waaruit het luchtvervoer afkomstig is, kunnen eenzijdig maatregelen nemen om de invoering van bedoeld tarief te beletten.   
5.  Wanneer een route wordt geëxploiteerd met uitoefening van vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten is het een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij niet toegestaan voor vergelijkbare categorieën tarieven in rekening te brengen die lager zijn dan de tarieven in rekening gebracht door luchtvaartmaatschappijen die derde- en vierde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten uitoefenen. Wanneer een route wordt geëxploiteerd met uitoefening van vijfdevrijheidsverkeersrechten heeft een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij echter wel het recht dezelfde tarieven te hanteren als enige andere luchtvaartmaatschappij die dezelfde route exploiteert met uitoefening van derde-, vierde- of vijfde-vrijheidsverkeersrechten.   
6.  Elke Partij kan verlangen dat tarieven die in rekening worden gebracht of zullen worden gebracht naar of vanuit haar grondgebied, bij haar luchtvaartautoriteiten worden ingediend.   
7.  Indien indiening wordt verlangd, worden de tarieven door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen ten hoogste dertig (30) dagen voor de voorgestelde datum van inwerkingtreding overgelegd, tenzij genoemde autoriteiten ermede instemmen deze periode in bijzondere gevallen te bekorten.   
8.  De tarieven kunnen uitdrukkelijk worden goedgekeurd of worden, indien geen van de luchtvaartautoriteiten in kwestie binnen vijftien (15) dagen na de datum van voorlegging overeenkomstig het zevende lid van dit artikel te kennen heeft gegeven de tarieven niet goed te keuren, geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Indien de termijn voor de voorlegging van tarieven wordt verkort, zoals bepaald in het zevende lid van dit artikel, wordt de termijn waarbinnen van het niet goedkeuren kennis dient te worden gegeven dienovereenkomstig verkort.   
9.  Overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel vastgestelde tarieven blijven van kracht totdat nieuwe tarieven zijn vastgesteld.   
10.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mogen geen tarieven berekenen die afwijken van die welke in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn vastgesteld.   
11.  Wanneer zulks noodzakelijk is of door een der Partijen wordt verlangd, plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten overleg omtrent de toepassing van dit artikel en/of de door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen toegepaste tarieven.   

### Artikel  7  

####Commerciële activiteiten

1.  Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toegestaan om: 

a. op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kantoren te vestigen ten behoeve van de bevordering van het luchtvervoer en de verkoop van luchtdiensten (met inbegrip van bijv. vliegbiljetten, het afgeven van eigen biljetten en luchtvrachtbrieven) alsook andere voor het verzorgen van luchtvervoer vereiste voorzieningen ;  

b. op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij rechtstreeks, of naar eigen goeddunken, via hun agenten zich met de verkoop van luchtvervoer bezig te houden.     
2.  Het is de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij toegestaan om haar in verband met het verzorgen van luchtvervoer benodigde leidinggevend, commercieel, operationeel en technisch personeel te zenden naar en te doen verblijven op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
3.  In deze behoeften aan personeel kan naar keuze van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij worden voorzien door haar eigen personeel of door gebruikmaking van diensten van een andere organisatie, onderneming of luchtvaartmaatschappij die werkzaam is op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en die gemachtigd is dergelijke diensten te verlenen op het grondgebied van laatstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
4.  Bovenvermelde activiteiten worden verricht in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
5.  Beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zien af van het vereiste van arbeidsvergunningen, bezoekersvisa of andere soortgelijke documenten voor personeel dat bepaalde tijdelijke diensten verleent of taken vervult, behalve in door de betrokken nationale autoriteiten te bepalen bijzondere omstandigheden. Wanneer zulke vergunningen, visa of documenten vereist zijn, worden zij onverwijld en kosteloos verstrekt, opdat de binnenkomst van het betrokken personeel in de Staat niet wordt vertraagd.   

### Artikel  8  

####Geautomatiseerde boekingssystemen

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen dat: 

a. het belang van gebruikers van luchtvervoerdiensten zal worden beschermd tegen alle misbruik van desbetreffende informatie, met inbegrip van misleidende weergave daarvan;  

b. de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en de agenten van de luchtvaartmaatschappij onbeperkt en non-discriminatoir toegang tot en gebruik van de GBS-en hebben op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

c. in dit opzicht de GBS-Gedragscode aangenomen door de EEG zal gelden op het grondgebied van Nederland, terwijl op het grondgebied van de Republiek Hongarije de geldende GBS-Gedragscode van de Europese Burgerluchtvaartconferentie van toepassing zal zijn.     
2.  Een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waarborgt aan de GBS-en die door de aangewezen vervoerder van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij als zijn hoofdsysteem zijn gekozen, vrije en onbelemmerde toegang tot haar grondgebied. Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zal op haar grondgebied aan het GBS van de aangewezen vervoerder van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij strengere eisen opleggen of toelaten dat deze worden opgelegd, dan die opgelegd aan het GBS van haar eigen aangewezen vervoerder, bijvoorbeeld ten aanzien van: 

a. de exploitatie en verkoop van de GBS-diensten, met inbegrip van de regels inzake het tonen en redigeren van GBS, en  

b. de toegang tot en het gebruik van communicatievoorzieningen, keuze en gebruik van technische apparatuur en programma's of de installatie van apparatuur.     

### Artikel  9  

####Billijke en eerlijke concurrentie

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Partijen worden op eerlijke en gelijke wijze in de gelegenheid gesteld deel te nemen aan het internationale luchtvervoer dat door deze Overeenkomst wordt beheerst.   
2.  Elke Partij treft alle passende maatregelen binnen haar rechtsmacht ter bestrijding van alle vormen van discriminatie of oneerlijke concurrentiepraktijken die de concurrentiepositie van de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Partij nadelig beïnvloeden.   
3.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de ene Partij houdt bij de exploitatie van overeengekomen diensten op een omschreven route naar behoren rekening met de belangen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Partij wanneer zij dezelfde route exploiteert. Met name dient het eerste doel te zijn te voorzien in de huidige en verwachte vervoersbehoeften betreffende het vervoer van passagiers, vracht en/of post op de omschreven routes.   
4.  Geen der Partijen beperkt eenzijdig de in deze Overeenkomst en de Bijlage daarbij vervatte rechten ten aanzien van de omvang van het vervoer, de frequentie of regelmaat van de dienst of het type vliegtuig dat of de typen vliegtuigen die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Partij wordt/worden geëxploiteerd, behalve voor zover nodig uit een oogpunt van douane, technische voorschriften, exploitatie of milieu, in welk geval zulke beperkingen onder eenvormige voorwaarden worden toegepast op non-discriminatoire wijze en verenigbaar met artikel 15 van het Verdrag van Chicago.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dienstregeling

1.  De door elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij legt 60 dagen tevoren de dienstregeling van haar voorgenomen diensten ter goedkeuring voor aan de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, en vermeldt daarbij de frequentie, het type luchtvaartuig, de klasse-indeling en het aantal der zitplaatsen dat beschikbaar zal zijn voor het publiek.   
2.  Verzoeken om toestemming voor het uitvoeren van extra vluchten kunnen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij rechtstreeks aan de luchtvaartautoriteit van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ter goedkeuring worden voorgelegd.   

### Artikel  11  

####Belastingen, douanerechten en heffingen

1.  Luchtvaartuigen die door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op internationale luchtdiensten worden gebruikt, alsmede hun normale uitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en boordproviand (waaronder etenswaren, dranken en tabaksartikelen) die zich aan boord bevinden, en reclame- en promotiemateriaal aan boord van zodanige luchtvaartuigen, zijn bij binnenkomst op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vrijgesteld van alle douanerechten, inspectiekosten en soortgelijke nationale of lokale heffingen en belastingen, mits genoemde uitrusting en voorraden aan boord van het luchtvaartuig blijven totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd.   
2.  Ten aanzien van normale uitrustingsstukken, reservedelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en boordproviand die op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden gebracht door of namens een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, of aan boord worden genomen van een luchtvaartuig dat wordt geëxploiteerd door een zodanige aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij en uitsluitend zijn bestemd voor gebruik aan boord tijdens de exploitatie van internationale diensten, gelden geen lokale en/of nationale heffingen en belastingen, waaronder douanerechten en inspectiekosten, die op het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij worden opgelegd, zelfs niet wanneer deze voorraden worden gebruikt op delen van het traject die worden afgelegd boven het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij waarop zij aan boord zijn genomen. Ten aanzien van de hierboven genoemde goederen kan worden verlangd dat zij onder toezicht en controle van de douane worden gehouden. De bepalingen van dit lid mogen niet zodanig worden uitgelegd, dat een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ertoe kan worden verplicht reeds op de hierboven genoemde artikelen geheven douanerechten terug te betalen.   
3.  De normale boorduitrustingstukken, reservedelen, voorraden brandstof en smeermiddelen en boordproviand die zich aan boord bevinden van de luchtvaartuigen van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kunnen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij slechts worden uitgeladen met toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van laatstgenoemde Partij, die kunnen verlangen dat deze onder hun toezicht worden geplaatst totdat zij weer worden uitgevoerd of overeenkomstig de douanevoorschriften een andere bestemming hebben gekregen.   

### Artikel  12  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Inkomen en winst uit de exploitatie van luchtvaartuigen in internationaal vervoer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van daadwerkelijk beheer van de ondernemingen is gelegen.   
2.  Winst uit de vervreemding van in internationaal vervoer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen is slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van daadwerkelijk beheer van de ondernemingen is gelegen.   
3.  Kapitaal vertegenwoordigd door in internationaal vervoer geëxploiteerde luchtvaartuigen en door met de exploitatie van zulke luchtvaartuigen verband houdende roerende goederen is slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van daadwerkelijk beheer van de onderneming is gelegen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn ook van toepassing op inkomen en winst uit deelneming in een samenwerkingsverband („pool”), een gemeenschappelijke onderneming („joint business”) of een internationale exploitatie-instelling („international operating agency”).   

### Artikel  13  

####Overmaking van gelden

1.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn vrij het batig saldo van de ontvangsten en uitgaven op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij over te maken naar het grondgebied waar hun zetel is gevestigd. In deze netto-overmaking zijn begrepen inkomsten uit verkopen, in welke valuta dan ook, rechtstreeks of via agenten, van luchtvervoersdiensten en van bijkomende of aanvullende diensten, en de gebruikelijke commerciële rente op deze inkomsten verkregen terwijl zij op een depositorekening stonden in afwachting van de overmaking.   
2.  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ontvangen binnen ten hoogste dertig (30) dagen na aanvraag goedkeuring voor zulk een overmaking in een vrij inwisselbare valuta, tegen de officiële wisselkoers voor omwisseling van de plaatselijke valuta op de datum van overmaking. De luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn vrij de feitelijke overmaking onmiddellijk na ontvangst van de goedkeuring te verrichten.   

### Artikel  14  

####Toepassing van wetten, voorschriften en procedures

1.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij betreffende de toelating tot of het vertrek uit haar grondgebied van in internationale luchtdiensten gebruikte luchtvaartuigen of betreffende de exploitatie van en het vliegen met zodanige luchtvaartuigen dienen door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te worden nageleefd vanaf de binnenkomst in en tot en met het vertrek uit genoemd grondgebied.   
2.  De wetten, voorschriften en procedures van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij betreffende immigratie, paspoorten, of andere erkende reisdocumenten, binnenkomst, inklaring, douane en quarantaine dienen te worden nageleefd door of namens bemanningsleden, passagiers, vracht en post vervoerd door luchtvaartuigen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij vanaf de binnenkomst in en tot en met het vertrek uit het grondgebied van eerstgenoemde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
3.  Passagiers, bagage en vracht die op doorreis zijn via het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en die de zone van de luchthaven die daarvoor gereserveerd is niet verlaten en in het geval van lading voorzien van het merkteken van de veiligheidscontrole in het land van oorsprong, worden, behalve wat veiligheidsmaatregelen tegen geweld en luchtpiraterij betreft, slechts aan een vereenvoudigde controle onderworpen. Bagage en vracht op doorreis zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en andere soortgelijke belastingen.   
4.  Kosten en heffingen die op het grondgebied van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij met betrekking tot de vluchten van de luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening worden gebracht voor het gebruik van luchthavens en andere luchtvaartvoorzieningen op het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Partij, mogen niet hoger zijn dan die welke in rekening worden gebracht met betrekking tot de vluchten van een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij die soortgelijke vluchten uitvoert.   
5.  Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen begunstigt een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij ten opzichte van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bij de toepassing van haar voorschriften inzake douane, immigratie, quarantaine en soortgelijke voorschriften of bij het gebruik van luchthavens, luchtwegen, luchtverkeersdiensten en aanverwante voorzieningen waarover zij zeggenschap heeft.   

### Artikel  15  

####Erkenning van bewijzen en vergunningen

Bewijzen van luchtwaardigheid, bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen die door een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn uitgereikt of geldig verklaard en die nog niet zijn verlopen, worden door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij als geldig erkend voor de exploitatie van overeengekomen diensten op de omschreven routes, mits deze bewijzen en vergunningen werden uitgereikt of geldig verklaard overeenkomstig de op grond van het Verdrag vastgestelde normen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij behoudt zich evenwel het recht voor om voor vluchten boven haar grondgebied de erkenning te weigeren van bewijzen van bevoegdheid en vergunningen die door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zijn verstrekt aan haar eigen onderdanen.  

### Artikel  16  

####Veiligheid

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen elkander de bijstand te verlenen die nodig is ter voorkoming van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen en andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens en luchtvaartvoorzieningen, en elke andere bedreiging voor de veiligheid van de luchtvaart.   
2.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stemt ermede in de niet-discriminatoire en algemeen toepasselijke veiligheidsbepalingen na te leven die de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij voorschrijft voor de binnenkomst op het grondgebied van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en toereikende maatregelen te treffen om passagiers en hun handbagage aan controle te onderwerpen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt ook elk verzoek van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om bijzondere veiligheidsmaatregelen voor haar luchtvaartuigen of passagiers om het hoofd te bieden aan een specifieke bedreiging welwillend in overweging.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen handelen overeenkomstig de toepasselijke beveiligingsbepalingen voor de luchtvaart die zijn vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Indien een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van deze bepalingen afwijkt, kan de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verzoeken om overleg met die Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Tenzij anders door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is overeengekomen, begint zodanig overleg binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek ter zake. Het uitblijven van een bevredigend akkoord kan een grond vormen voor toepassing van artikel 18 van deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen handelen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag inzake strafbare feiten en bepaalde andere handelingen begaan aan boord van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te Tokio op 14 september 1963, het Verdrag tot bestrijding van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen, ondertekend te 's-Gravenhage op 16 december 1970, en het Verdrag tot bestrijding van wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart, ondertekend te Montreal op 23 september 1971, voor zover beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen partij zijn bij deze verdragen.   
5.  Wanneer zich een voorval voordoet van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van een luchtvaartuig of van andere wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van een luchtvaartuig, of zich dreigt voor te doen, verlenen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander bijstand door de verbindingen die bedoeld zijn om op snelle en veilige wijze aan zulk een voorval of de dreiging daarvan een einde te maken, te vergemakkelijken.   

### Artikel  17  

####Overleg en wijziging

1.  In een geest van nauwe samenwerking plegen de luchtvaartautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van tijd tot tijd overleg met elkander, ten einde te verzekeren dat de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst worden uitgevoerd en naar tevredenheid worden nageleefd.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen kan verzoeken om overleg met het oog op wijziging van deze Overeenkomst of van de Bijlage daarbij. Dit overleg vangt aan binnen een termijn van zestig (60) dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij anderszins overeengekomen. Bedoeld overleg kan mondeling of schriftelijk geschieden.   
3.  Elke door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeengekomen wijziging op deze Overeenkomst treedt in werking op de datum waarop de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkander schriftelijk ervan in kennis hebben gesteld dat aan hun onderscheiden constitutionele vereisten is voldaan.   
4.  Elke wijziging op de Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst wordt schriftelijk overeengekomen tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten en treedt in werking op een door deze autoriteiten te bepalen datum.   

### Artikel  18  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen een geschil ontstaat met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van de onderhavige Overeenkomst, trachten de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dit in de eerste plaats te regelen door middel van onderlinge onderhandelingen, rechtstreeks tussen de luchtvaartautoriteiten dan wel langs diplomatieke weg.   
2.  Indien de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen er niet in slagen door middel van onderhandeling het geschil te regelen, kan het op verzoek van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan een gerecht van drie scheidsmannen, van wie elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij er een benoemt, waarna de aldus gekozen twee scheidsmannen gezamenlijk de derde aanwijzen, op voorwaarde dat de derde scheidsman geen onderdaan van een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen is. Elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen wijst een scheidsman aan binnen een termijn van zestig dagen na de datum waarop een van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een diplomatieke nota heeft ontvangen waarin om een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing wordt verzocht, en de derde scheidsman wordt binnen een volgende termijn van zestig dagen aangewezen. Indien een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn eigen scheidsman niet aanwijst binnen de termijn van zestig dagen en indien de derde scheidsman niet binnen de genoemde termijn is aangewezen, kan de Voorzitter van de Raad van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden verzocht een scheidsman of scheidsmannen te benoemen.   
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verplichten zich ertoe zich te houden aan elke uitspraak gedaan op grond van het tweede lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  19  

####Beëindiging

Deze Overeenkomst blijft van kracht totdat een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij langs diplomatieke weg de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mededeling doet van haar voornemen deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen. Deze mededeling wordt tegelijkertijd gezonden aan de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. In een dergelijk geval eindigt deze Overeenkomst twaalf (12) maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, tenzij de mededeling van beëindiging in onderlinge overeenstemming wordt ingetrokken vóór het verstrijken van deze termijn. Indien de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij nalaat de ontvangst te bevestigen, wordt de mededeling geacht te zijn ontvangen veertien (14) dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.
