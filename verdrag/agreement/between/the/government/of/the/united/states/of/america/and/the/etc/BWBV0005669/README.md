####Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Regarding settlement for Lend-Lease, reciprocal aid, surplus property, military relief, and claims

The Government of the United States of America (hereinafter referred to as the United States Government) and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Netherlands Government), comprising the Kingdom in Europe, the Netherlands Indies and Territories of Surinam and Curaçao, have reached an understanding regarding a settlement for lend-lease and reciprocal aid, for certain surplus property, for the Netherlands Government's obligation to the United States Government for civilian supplies furnished as military relief in the Netherlands and in the Netherlands Indies, and for other financial claims of each Government against the other arising out of the conduct of the war. This settlement is complete and final, and both Governments agree that, except as herein specifically provided, no further benefits will be sought by either Government as consideration for the foregoing. In arriving at this understanding, both Governments have recognized the benefits accruing to each from their contributions to the defeat of their common enemies, and have adhered to and hereby reaffirm their adherence to the principles expressed in Article VII of the Preliminary Agreement on Principles Applying to Mutual Aid in the Prosecution of the War Against Aggression, signed on July 8, 1942. 

1.  *Amount Due*   

As used in this Agreement the „total principal amount” due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government is the sum of: 

A. $ 67.500.000, which is agreed by the two Governments to be the net amount due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government with respect to lend-lease, reciprocal aid, civilian supplies furnished as military relief in the Netherlands (Plan A) and in the Netherlands Indies, certain aircraft heretofore sold by the United States Government to the Netherlands Government, certain claims between the two Governments settled by this Agreement, and guilders in the accounts of finance officers of the United States armed forces, and  

B. The amount due to the United States Government from the Netherlands Government under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit (referred to in paragraph 5 of this Agreement) for the purchase of surplus property.   The terms of payment of the total principal amount are set forth in paragraph 6 of this Agreement.  

2.  *Military Relief and Related Operations*   

In view of the benefits accruing to the two Governments from their contributions to the common war effort and in view of the payment specified in sub-paragraph 1 A of this Agreement and of the other provisions of this Agreement: 

A. The obligation of the Netherlands Government for the United States Government's share of the combined bills for civilian supplies furnished as military relief in the Netherlands (Plan A) is considered settled. The Netherlands Government recognizes that the settlement hereby made with the United States Government in no way impairs the obligation of the Netherlands Government to the United Kingdom and Canadian Governments for their shares of the combined claim for Plan A.  

B. The United States Government's share of guilder proceeds from the sale of Allied publications distributed in the Netherlands in connection with military operations reverts to the Netherlands Government.    

3.  *Intergovernmental Claims*  

A. The following financial claims between the two Governments will be settled and paid in dollars in accordance with procedures already established: 

(1) Claims of the United States Government for the cost of lend-lease supplies and services transferred to the Netherlands Government by the United States Government on cash reimbursement terms not subsequently converted to other terms, and claims of the Netherlands Government for the excess of the amounts deposited by it with the United States Government under cash reimbursement lend-lease requisitions (including requisitions subsequently converted wholly or partly to other terms) over the cost of supplies and services transferred thereunder to the Netherlands Government on cash reimbursement terms not subsequently converted to other terms.  

(2) Balance owing to the Netherlands Government under the portion of the agreement described in the Memorandum signed on May 30, 1942 by representatives of the United States Department of State and Office of Lend-Lease Administration whereby the United States Government took over the war material in the United States procured by, or at that time under contracts in the United States let by, the Netherlands Government.  

(3) Claims covered by the „Memorandum Concerning Disposition of and Payment for Cargoes Carried on Twelve Dutch Ships Diverted to Australia”, dated December 20, 1944, and claims covered by the „Memorandum Concerning Disposition of and Payment for Certain Aircraft and Gun Parts Shipped to Australia by Netherlands Purchasing Commission”, dated December 20, 1944.  

(4) Claims of either Government against the other arising under the terms of the Netherlands-American Charter Plan dated March 6, 1942.  

(5) Claims of either Government against the other arising under the „bareboat out-time charter back” chartering arrangements, including claims of the Netherlands Government against the United States Government as war or marine risk insurer or assumer by reason of (*a*) any lost or damage to the chartered vessel or (*b*) any claims against the chartered vessel other than (*i*) those waived or assumed under this Agreement, (*ii*) those waived, or assumed by a third government or UNRRA under any present or future agreement with the United States Government, and (*iii*) those subject to the practice of the United States Government regarding inter-departmental waiver of claims.  

(6) The claim of the Netherlands Government for repayment of the net balance of guilders advanced by it to the United States War Shipping Administration.  

(7) The claim of the Netherlands Government for the repayment of the payment previously made to the United States Government under the „Agreement between the United States of America and the Kingdom of the Netherlands under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act”, signed on April 30, 1945.    

B. To avoid the necessity of making adjustments hereafter in certain accounts and to facilitate the determination of certain amounts payable under sub-paragraph 3A of this Agreement, the two Governments agree upon $ 17,820,000 as the cost of supplies and services transferred to the Netherlands Government through the agency of the United States War and Navy Departments, on cash reimbursement terms not subsequently converted to straight lend-lease terms, under lend-lease requisitions which, when filed by the Netherlands Government, called for direct cash reimbursement, but not including lend-lease requisitions filed directly with the United States Navy Department. This sum of $ 17,820,000, heretofore paid by the Netherlands Government, includes an allowance for charges not yet reported and is not subject to adjustment. Such allowance will be disregarded in determining claims under sub-paragraph 3A (3) of this Agreement.  

C. The two Governments have agreed upon arrangements and procedures with respect to payment for articles and services procured in the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the United States armed forces and certain aircraft procured by the United States armed forces in the United States from the Netherlands Government with respect to the return to the Netherlands Government of guilders held by the United States armed forces.  

D. The claims between the two Governments listed in Appendix 1 hereto are among those settled by this Agreement and appropriate allowances have been made therefor in computing the net amount due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government under sub-paragraph 1A of this Agreement.  

E. The following arrangements are agreed on with respect to the time during which the large U. S. 7(c) ships and the small U. S. 7(c) ships (as defined in Appendix 1 hereto), as the case may be, were severally operated by the Netherlands Government for the United States Government during the 7(c) period (as defined in Appendix 1 hereto): 

(1) The United States Government will bear the cost of all services and supplies, not hitherto paid for by the Netherlands Government, furnished by the United States Government to the Netherlands Government for the large U. S. 7(c) ships and the small U. S. 7(c) ships during such time.  

(2) The Netherlands Government will retain all earnings, if any, arising from the commercial carriage of passengers and cargo on the large U. S. 7(c) ships and the small U. S. 7(c) ships during such time.  

(3) The Netherlands Government will process all claims against the United States Government, or respecting which the ultimate liability is that of the United States Government, arising from the commercial carriage of passengers and cargo on the large U. S. 7(c) ships and the small U. S. 7(c) ships during such time, and will discharge the liability of the United State Government with respect thereto, except to the extent that third Governments have already undertaken to do so without being reimbursed in cash.    

F. As further specified in Appendix 2 hereto, each Government waives all its claims against the other which arose out of requisitioning for use in the war program of properly of the claimant Government and, except as provided in sub-paragraph 3A(5) of this Agreement, all its claims against the other, and all its claims respecting which the ultimate liability is that of the other, which arose out of maritime incidents occuring on or after May 10, 1940 and prior to July 1, 1946.  

G. Each Government waives all other financial claims against the other Government not otherwise dealt with in this Agreement which 

(a) have arisen or may hereafter arise out lend-lease or reciprocal aid, or  

(b) otherwise arose out of incidents occuring on or after May 10, 1940 and prior to July 1, 1946 connected with or incidental to the conduct of the war, except 

(1) claims arising out of established arrangements where liability has heretofore been acknowledged and the method of computation agreed;  

(2) claims arising out of retransfers, consented to by the United States Government after December 31, 1946, of lend-lease articles by a third government to the Netherlands Government; and  

(3) claims presented in accordance with the practice whereby one government espouses a claim of one of its nationals and submits it through diplomatic channels to another government.        

4.  *Private Claims*  

A. The Netherlands Government will process the claims described in the following sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) and will discharge the liability with respect thereto of the United States Government and of the individuals, firms and corporations against whom such claims are asserted as there described, except to the extent that third governments have already undertaken to do so without being reimbursed in cash, namely: 

(1) Claims against the United States Government, or respecting which the ultimate liability is that of the United States Government, arising from maritime incidents (including those specified in Appendix 2 hereto) occurring on or after May 10, 1940 and prior to July 1, 1946, asserted or about to be asserted in courts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, or asserted anywhere by individuals, firms and corporations, subjects of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time of the event giving rise to the claim, but not including claims of Netherlands subjects based upon service as seamen. In addition, as part of the general settlement, the Netherlands Government, without giving rise to any financial obligation on the part of the United States Government, will, at the request of the United States Government, take such steps as may be necessary, including the assumption of financial responsibility, to release vessels and cargoes belonging to the United States Government from legal actions brought to enforce any such claims.  

(2) Claims of individuals, firms and corporations, domiciled in territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at any time between May 10, 1940, and September 2, 1945 (except individuals who are exclusively United States nationals) against the United States Government, its contractors or sub-contractors, for royalties under contracts for the use of inventions, patented or unpatented, or for infringement of patent rights, in connection with war production carried on or contracted for prior to September 2, 1945 by the United States Government, its contractors or subcontractors.  

(3) Claims, whether contractual or non-contractual, against the United States Government and against members of its armed forces and civilian personnel attached thereto arising out of acts or omissions in territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of members of such armed forces or such civilian personnel, both line-of-duty and non-line-of-duty, occurring on or after May 10, 1940 and prior to September 2, 1945, in the case of contracts, and occurring on or after May 10, 1940 and prior to July 1, 1946 in the case of other acts or omissions.  

(4) Claims of individuals, firms and corporations, subjects of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time of the event giving rise to the claim, against the United States Government arising out of the requisitioning (as specified in Appendix 2 hereto) for use in the war program of property located in the United States in which the claimant asserts an interest.    

B. An appropriate allowance for the undertaking of the Netherlands Government in sub-paragraph 4A of this Agreement has been made in computing the net amount of $ 67.500.000 due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government under sub-paragraph 1A of this Agreement.    

5.  *Surplus Property*  

A. The two Governments agree that their rights and obligations in connection with the line of credit for the purchase of surplus property heretofore granted by the United States Government in the amount of $ 30.000.000 (originally $ 20.000.000) shall be as stated in this Agreement; and the letters dated May 14, 1946 and December 9, 1946, from the United States Central Field Commissioner for Europe, Office of the Foreign Liquidation Commissioner, to the Netherlands Treasurer General, accepted by the Netherlands Government, establishing the line of credit, and subsequent communications relating thereto, are superseded by this Agreement. Like provision regarding the rights and obligations under the line of credit for the purchase of surplus property heretofore granted by the United States Government to the Netherlands Indies Government in the amount of $ 100.000.000 is made in a separate agreement signed concurrently herewith by the United States Government and the Netherlands Indies Government.  

B. The terms of payment of the amount due under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit shall be as stated in paragraph 6 of this Agreement. This change from the original terms of payment, and the like change regarding the $ 100.000.000 line of credit made in the separate agreement signed concurrently herewith by the United States Government and the Netherlands Indies Government, have been consented to by the United States Government as part of the general settlement herein made.  

C. The $ 30.000.000 line of credit is for use in purchasing prior to January 1, 1948 United States surplus property, wherever situated, made available by the Office of the Foreign Liquidation Commissioner.  

D. Charges heretofore made against the $ 30.000.000 line of credit shall continue to be charges against it as from the respective dates of the charges, but, with respect to the accrual of interest, shall be subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph 6C of this Agreement. The bulk sales of surplus property in the Territories of Curaçao and Surinam shall be charges against the $ 30.000.000 line of credit.  

E. Procedural arrangements heretofore made in connection with the $ 30.000.000 line of credit shall continue in force until changed.    

6.  *Terms of Payment*  

A. The Netherlands Government undertakes that, as and when the amounts payable by the United States Government under sub-paragraph 3A of this Agreement are paid, it will pay equivalent amounts in dollars to the United States Government up to a total of $ 19.500.000, in partial payment of the total principal amount due from it to the United States Government.  

B. The remainder of the total principal amount due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government will be paid by the Netherlands Government to the United States Government in dollars in thirty annual instalments, which shall become payable on July 1 of each year beginning July 1, 1951. The first instalment shall be equal to one-thirtieth of the unpaid portion as of July 1, 1951 of the total principal amount. Each subsequent instalment shall be equal to so much of the unpaid portion (as of the date of the instalment) of the total principal amount as has not previously become payable, divided by the number of instalments that have not previously become payable.  

C. Interest will be paid to the United States Government by the Netherlands Government in dollars at the fixed rate of two percent per annum on $ 50.000.000 (which is agreed to be the net sum of such of the charges constituting the total principal amount as are attributable to the period before July 1, 1946) for the period from July 1, 1946 through June 30, 1947, and, accruing from Juli 1, 1947, on the unpaid remainder of the total principal amount. With respect, however, to charges made under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit, interest shall accrue from the first day of July next following the date on which each charge is made. With respect to the amount of any reduction in the total principal amount under the terms of sub-paragraph 6 D and parapgraph 7 of this Agreement interest for the period from the preceding July 1 shall be charged only to the date of such reduction. Interest shall be payable annually on July 1 of each year beginning July 1, 1947.  

D. The Netherlands Government may at any time or times make payments to the United States Government under this Agreement of amounts not then payable or larger than are then payable. Any such payments will be credited first to past due interest, if any, and then to past due instalments, if any, and then to the unpaid remainder of the total principal amount.  

E. If by agreement of both Governments it is determined that because extraordinary and adverse economic conditions arising during the course of payment, any of the periodic payments of interest, of principal, of interest and principal, or of any part thereof would not be to the common advantage of both Governments, payment may be postponed on such terms and conditions as may be agreed.    

7.  *Provision of Netherlands Currency and of Property*  

A. The Netherlands Government, when requested by the United States Government, will make available at any time or times, by payment to the United States Government or to such persons or organizations as the United States Government may designate, Netherlands currency in any amount (computed as provided in sub-paragraph 7 E of this Agreement) not in excess of the then unpaid portion of the total principal amount plus past due interest, for: 

(1) The payment of any or all of the ordinary governmental expenditures in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (other than the Netherlands Indies) of the United States Government or any department or agency thereof;  

(2) The acquisition of real property, improvements thereon or furnishings therefor, agreed upon by the two Governments; and  

(3) The payment of the cost of educational programs agreed upon by the two Governments.    

B. In case the United States Government wishes to acquire any property (located in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, other than the Netherlands Indies), real or personal, tangible or intangible (other than for export except by mutual agreement), or to improve or furnish any property so located in which it has an interest, the Netherlands Government will at any time or times, as requested by the United States Government, enter into negotiations, and use its best efforts consistent with its public policy, to reach an agreement with the United States Government whereby there will be delivered to the United States Government the properties, improvements or furnishings which the United States Government desires or which the representatives of the United States Government have selected. Representatives of the United States Government may at their discretion conduct discussions directly with owners of property or with contractors for improvements or furnishings as to fair terms and prices prior to the delivery of such property or improvements or furnishings to the United States Government.  

C. The United States Government declares that it is now its intention to request that Netherlands currency be made available for agreed educational programs under sub paragraph 7 A of this Agreement to the value of $ 5.000.000 and that it is now its intention to request that Netherlands currency be made available for, or that there be delivered, real property, improvements and furnishings, or both, under sub-paragraphs 7 A and 7 B of this Agreement to the value $ 8.700.000. This statement of intention does not prevent the United States Government from later proposing different amounts from these in these connections. The foregoing amounts are inclusive of amounts heretofore requested under corresponding arrangements hitherto existing under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit.  

D. The dollar equivalent (computed in accordance with subparagraph 7 E of this Agreement) of any Netherlands currency made available and of the Netherlands currency value of any properties, improvements and furnishings delivered under this paragraph 7 or under corresponding arrangements hitherto existing under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit shall be credited first to interest, if any, and then to instalments, if any, past due to the United States Government under this Agreement and then to the unpaid remainder of the total principal amount due under this Agreement.  

E. Any Netherlands currency made available and the Netherlands currency value of any properties, improvements and furnishings delivered under this paragraph 7 or under corresponding arrangements hitherto existing under the $ 30.000.000 line of credit will be valued at the par value between such currency and dollars established in conformity with procedures of the International Monetary Fund, or, if no such par value exists, at the rate most favorable to the United States Government used by the Netherlands Government in any official transaction at the time of the request by the United States Government that such currency be made available or that such properties, improvements or furnishings be delivered.    

8.  *Silver*  Nothing in this Agreement affects the obligations of the Netherlands Government in connection with silver transferred to it by the United States Government under lend-lease.  

9.  *Transfer of Title*  

A. Except as provided in sub-paragraphs 9B and 9C of this Agreement, the Netherlands Government and the United States Government receive full title, without qualification as to disposition or use, to alle articles now held by them respectively which were supplied under lend-lease or reciprocal aid, but including retransferred lend-lease articles only to the extent that consent to the retransfer was given by the United States Government before January 1, 1947.  

B. Each Government reserves the right of recapture of any arms, ammunition and implements of war (as defined in Appendix 2 hereto) which were supplied under lend-lease or reciprocal aid and are held by the other Government on the date on which notice requesting return is communicated to the other Government (excepting, however, those supplied under lend-lease on cash reimbursement terms not subsequently converted to straight lend-lease terms); but each Government has indicated that it does not intend to exercise generally its right of recapture of such articles. Disposals of such articles in or for use in third world countries will be made only with the consent of the supplying Government and with payment to the supplying Government of any proceeds of such disposals. Each Government agrees that all such articles held by it will be used only for purposes compatible with the principles of international security and welfare set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.  

C. To the extent required by United States law, naval and merchant vessels which were made available to the Netherlands Government under lend-lease will be returned to the United States Government.    

10.  *Miscellaneous Provisions*  

A. References in this Agreement to articles supplied under lend-lease, and to lend-lease transfers, include lend-lease articles transferred by the United States Government to a third government and retransferred by the third government to the Netherlands Government.  

B. To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement are inconsistent with those contained in any previous agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.  

C. Nothing in this Agreement affects the obligation of the Netherlands Government under Article IV of the Preliminary Agreement of July 8, 1942, relating to patents.  

D. The two Governments agree to conclude such specific agreements as may be necessary to implement this general understanding.  

E. This Agreement will be effective upon signature.

### APPENDIX  I  

####Certain claims between the two Governments settled by this Agreement

As stated in sub-paragraph 3D of this Agreement, the claims between the two Governments listed in this Appendix are among those settled by this Agreement and appropriate allowances have been made therefor in computing the net amount due from the Netherlands Government to the United States Government under sub-paragraph 1A of this Agreement. 

I.  *Claims of the Netherlands Government*  As used in this Agreement the term „large U.S. 7 (c) ships” means the ships listed in Schedule 1 hereto attached, and the term „small U S. 7 (c) ships” means the ships listed in Schedule 2 hereto attached. All these ships were originally among those chartered by the British Minister of War Transport from the Netherlands Government pursuant to the „Memorandum of Arrangement Regarding Netherlands East Indies Shipping. 5th June 1942.” and allocated to the United States Government. They were the ships later removed from that arrangement, with the concurrence of the United Kingdom Government, by an exchange of notes between the Netherlands Embassy at Washington and the United States Department of State dated June 6, 1945 and July 31, 1945, and they were severally operated by the Netherlands Government for the United States Government in conformity with that exchange of notes for the whole of the 7 (c) period (as defined below) or from the beginning of the 7 (c) period until they were allocated during the 7 (c) period to the United Kingdom Government. The designation „7(c)”derives from the application to these ships of paragraph 7 (c) (second sentence) of the Agreement on Principles Having Reference to the Co-ordinated Control of Merchant Shipping, signed in London on August 5, 1944. The term „7(c) period” means, as used in this Agreement, in respect of the large U. S. 7(c) ships and the small U. S. 7(c) ships, the period from midnight May 23, 1945 until the date of redelivery in each case to the Netherlands Government, or until March 2, 1946, whichever was the earlier. As used in this Agreement the term „June 5 Memorandum” means the above mentioned Memorandum of June 5, 1942. 28 

A. The following claims of the Netherlands Government against the United States Government in connection with the large U. S. 7(c) ships are among those settled by this Agreement: 

1. Services and supplies for the large U. S. 7(c) ships during the 7(c) period.  

2. 
(a) Reconditioning and reconversion of the ships listed in Part A of Schedule 1 hereto attached, and  

(b) reconversion, as distinguished from reconditioning, of the ships listed in Part B of Schedule 1 hereto attached. 

(i) The contribution of the United States Government toward vessel expenses during the respective periods of reconditioning reconversion, forming part of the allowance for the claims set forth in clauses 2(a) and 2(b) immediately above, has been computed on the basic bareboat rate under the June 5 Memorandum and respective time estimates for reconditioning/reconversion provided by the Netherlands Government.  

(ii) The allowance made by the United States Government for the replacement of furniture has been computed on the basis of the articles named in the respective off-survey reports, and on the basis of the cost of procurement and installation of the furniture at the respective ports of reconversion.  

(iii) The allowance made by the United States Government in respect of reconversion has been made, inter alia, on the basis of removing and making good in the way thereof fittings added during the conversion of the ships, and takes account of an allowance made by the Netherlands Government to the United States Government for equipment of the United States Government left aboard. Such equipment becomes the property of the Netherlands Government.  

(iv) The allowance made by the United States Government with respect to reconditioning includes war risk insurance damage to the ships listed in Part A of Schedule 1 hereto attached, in so far as such damage was incurred during the 7(c) period.      

3. Costs of medical departments maintained by the Netherlands Government in the United States with respect to the large U. S. 7(c) ships during the 7(c) period.  

4. Services as Accounting Line (agency services) for the large U. S. 7(c) ships with respect to the 7(c) period.    

B. The following claims of the Netherlands Government against the United States Government in connection with the small U. S. 7(c) ships are among those settled by this Agreement: 

1. Services and supplies for the small U. S. 7(c) ships while they were severally operated by the Netherlands Government for the United States Government during the 7(c) period.  

2. Reconversion and reconditioning of the small U. S. 7(c) ships. The claim put forward by the Netherlands Government and the allowance therefor made by the United States Government have been restricted to expenses of reconversion and reconditioning attributable to the use of the ships by the United States Government during the 7(c) period and have been computed on a pro-rata basis on figures submitted by the Netherlands Government covering the over-all reconversion-reconditioning expenses arising from the date of delivery of the vessels under their basic charterparties in 1942. This claim is without prejudice to claims for additional reconversion/reconditioning expenses under the basic charterparties.  

3. Services as Accounting Line (agency services) for the small U. S. 7(c) ships with respect to the period while they were severally operated by the Netherlands Government for the United States Government during the 7(c) period.    

C. The following further shipping claims of the Netherlands Government against the United States Government are among those settled by this Agreement: 

1. A portion of the costs (not paid by the United States Navy) of arming certain Netherlands ships chartered pursuant to the June 5 Memorandum and allocated to the United States Government.  

2. 80 % payable in dollars, of the hire increase on ships chartered pursuant to the June 5 Memorandum (the hire increase being one shilling per deadweight ton per month from July 1, 1944 until redelivery and (due to the waiver of off-hire insurance) sixpence per deadweight ton per month from July 1, 1944 to December 31, 1944). The allowance made by the United States Government in respect of this claim is accepted by the Netherlands Government in satisfaction of its claim under the June 5 Memorandum for 80 %, payable in dollars, of such hire increase.  

3. Dollar expenditures for free Netherlands ships in United States ports between August 21, 1941 and September 30, 1945 of a type eligible for lend-lease.  

4. Charter hire in the amount of $ 180,000 under „bareboat out-time charter back” chartering arrangements (claim withdrawn in consideration of the withdrawal by the United States Government of its claim for reduction of charter hire under such arrangements).      

II.  *Claims of the United States Government*  

A. The following claims of the United States Government against the Netherlands Government are among those settled by this Agreement: 

1. Equipment of the United States Government left aboard the large U. S. 7 (c.) ships, as stated in sub-paragraph IA2 (Hi) of this Appendix.  

2. Dollar amounts due for retroactive reverse lend-lease under the exchange of letters between E. C. Zimmerman, Chairman of the Netherlands Purchasing Commission, and Charles Denby, Special Assistant for Reciprocal Aid, Foreign Economic Administration, dated September 20 and 26, 1944.

####Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden tot regeling der wederzijdse vorderingen en schulden uit hoofde van de uitvoering der Leen- en Pachtovereenkomst (Lend-Lease), de uitvoering der overeenkomst tot wederkerige hulpverlening (reciprocal aid), de verkoop van overtollige legergoederen (surplus property), de uitvoering van het militaire hulpprogramma voor de civiele bevolking (military relief)

De Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika (hierna aangeduid als de Amerikaanse Regering) en de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (hierna aangeduid als de Nederlandse Regering), omvattende het Koninkrijk in Europa, Nederlandsch-Indië en de gebiedsdelen Suriname en Curaçao, zijn tot overeenstemming gekomen inzake de regeling der schulden uit hoofde van de uitvoering der leen- en pachtovereenkomst, de uitvoering der overeenkomst tot wederkerige hulpverlening, de verkoop van bepaalde overtollige legergoederen, de verplichting van de Nederlandse Regering jegens de Amerikaanse Regering wegens de verstrekking van goederen, in het kader van het militaire hulpprogramma, aan de civiele bevolking in Nederland en Nederlandsch-Indië, en inzake de regeling der andere uit de oorlogvoering voortspruitende financiële vorderingen van de ene Regering op de andere. Deze regeling is volledig en definitief, en beide Regeringen komen overeen dat, behoudens hetgeen hierin bepaaldelijk is voorzien, geen der Regeringen enige verdere baten als vergoeding voor het vorenstaande zal trachten te verkrijgen. Door het bereiken van deze overeenkomst zijn beide Regeringen tot de erkenning gekomen van de voordelen, welke zij ieder uit hun bijdragen tot de nederlaag van hun gemeenschappelijke vijanden genoten hebben; zij zijn getrouw gebleven aan en verklaren bij deze nogmaals getrouw te zijn aan de beginselen, neergelegd in Artikel VII van de op 8 Juli 1942 getekende voorlopige overeenkomst inzake de beginselen, geldende voor de wederkerige hulpverlening bij de voortzetting van de oorlog tegen aanranding. 

1.  *Verschuldigd bedrag*  De door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigde „totale hoofdsom”, zoals deze in de onderhavige overeenkomst wordt genoemd, bestaat uit de som van: 

A. $ 67.500.000, welk bedrag, zoals de beide Regeringen zijn overeengekomen, het netto bedrag uitmaakt, dat de Nederlandse Regering verschuldigd is aan de Amerikaanse Regering uit hoofde van de uitvoering der leen- en pachtovereenkomst en de uitvoering der overeenkomst tot wederkerige hulpverlening, de verstrekking van goederen, in het kader van het militaire programma, aan de civiele bevolking in Nederland (Plan A) en Nederlandsch-Indië, de verkoop van bepaalde vliegtuigen door de Amerikaanse Regering aan de Nederlandse Regering, bepaalde tussen de beide Regeringen bestaande vorderingen, welke door deze overeenkomst worden geregeld, en de in de boeken van de betaalmeesters der Amerikaanse strijdkrachten voorkomende guldenstegoeden en  

B. het bedrag, dat de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigd is ingevolge het $ 30.000.000 crediet voor de aankoop van overtollige legergoederen (omschreven in artikel 5 van deze overeenkomst).   De voorwaarden voor de betaling van de totale hoofdsom worden vermeld in artikel 6 van deze overeenkomst.  

2.  *Het militaire hulpprogramma en de daarmede verband houdende operaties*  Gezien de voordelen, welke de beide Regeringen uit hun bijdragen tot de gemeenschappelijke oorlogsinspanning genoten hebben, en gezien de, in artikel 1 sub A. van deze overeenkomst, nader omschreven betaling, alsmede gezien de andere voorzieningen in deze overeenkomst getroffen: 

A. Wordt aangenomen, dat aan de verplichting van de Nederlandse Regering tot betaling van het aandeel van de Amerikaanse Regering in de gecombineerde rekeningen voor de verstrekking van goederen, in het kader van het militaire hulpprogramma, aan de civiele bevolking in Nederland (Plan A.) is voldaan. De Nederlandse Regering erkent, dat de regeling, welke bij deze met de Amerikaanse Regering wordt getroffen, in geen enkel opzicht de verplichting van de Nederlandse Regering jegens de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Regering van Canada voor de betaling van hun aandeel in de gezamenlijke vordering terzake van Plan A. verkort.  

B. Komt het aandeel van de Amerikaanse Regering in de guldensopbrengsten uit de verkoop van publicaties der geallieerden, welke in verband met de militaire operaties in Nederland zijn verspreid, aan de Nederlandse Regering ten goede.    

3.  *Vorderingen tussen de Regeringen*  

A. De volgende financiële vorderingen tussen de beide Regeringen zullen overeenkomstig de reeds vastgestelde procedure worden verrekend en betaald in dollars: 

(1) Vorderingen van de Amerikaanse Regering uit hoofde van de kosten van lend-lease goederen en diensten, welke aan de Nederlandse Regering door de Amerikaanse Regering zijn verstrekt op voorwaarde van contante betaling, terwijl deze voorwaarde later niet door andere voorwaarden is vervangen, en vorderingen van de Nederlandse Regering voor de bedragen door haar gedeponeerd bij de Amerikaanse Regering voor de contant te betalen aanvragen voor lend-lease goederen (met inbegrip van die aanvragen, waarvoor later geheel of gedeeltelijk andere voorwaarden gesteld zijn), voorzover die bedragen de kosten te boven gaan van de goederen en diensten, welke op de aanvragen aan de Nederlandse Regering zijn verstrekt tegen contante betaling, terwijl deze voorwaarde later niet door andere voorwaarden is vervangen.  

(2) Het saldo aan de Nederlandse Regering verschuldigd ingevolge dat gedeelte van de overeenkomst, welke is neergelegd in het memorandum, dat op 30 Mei 1942 werd ondertekend door vertegenwoordigers van het Amerikaanse Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken en het Office of Lend Lease Administration, waarbij de Amerikaanse Regering het oorlogsmateriaal, dat in de Verenigde Staten door de Nederlandse Regering werd verstrekt, of in die tijd krachtens contracten in de Verenigde Staten werd verhuurd, heeft overgenomen.  

(3) Vorderingen vallende onder het „Memorandum betreffende de beschikking over en de betaling voor de zich, in twaalf naar Australië gezonden Nederlandse schepen, bevindende ladingen”, gedateerd 20 December 1944, alsmede vorderingen, vallende onder het „Memorandum betredende de beschikking over en de betaling voor zekere door de Nederlandse Inkoop Commissie naar Australië verscheepte vliegtuigen en kanon-onderdelen”, gedateerd 20 December 1944.  

(4) Wederzijdse vorderingen der beide Regeringen ontstaan krachtens de bepalingen van het Nederlands-Amerikaans Charter Plan, gedateerd 6 Maart 1942.  

(5) Wederzijdse vorderingen der beide Regeringen, ontstaan krachtens de „bareboat out-time charter back” charter-regelingen, waaronder vorderingen van de Nederlandse Regering op de Amerikaanse Regering, als verzekeraarster of aanvaardster van oorlogs- en zeerisico, wegens (a) verlies van of schade aan het gecharterde schip of (b) vorderingen op het gecharterde schip, behalve (1) die, waarvan afstand is gedaan of welke aanvaard zijn volgens deze overeenkomst, (2) die, waarvan afstand is gedaan of welke aanvaard worden door een derde Regering of de UNRRA op grond van een bestaande of toekomstige overeenkomst met de Amerikaanse Regering, en (3) die, welke onderworpen zijn aan de gebruiken, welke de Amerikaanse Regering kent bij de afstand van vorderingen tussen departementen onderling.  

(6) De vordering der Nederlandse Regering wegens het aan haar terug te betalen netto-saldo van de door haar aan de United States War Shipping Administration voorgeschoten guldens-bedragen.  

(7) De vordering der Nederlandse Regering wegens liet door haar terug te ontvangen bedrag, dat eertijds aan de Amerikaanse Regering werd betaald op grond van de op 30 April 1945 getekende „Overeenkomst tussen de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden ingevolge Artikel 3 C van de leen- en pachtwet”.    

B. Ter voorkoming van de noodzakelijkheid om later in bepaalde rekeningen wijzigingen te brengen en ten einde de vaststelling van bepaalde, ingevolge artikel 3 sub A, van deze overeenkomst te betalen, bedragen te vergemakkelijken, zijn de beide Regeringen overeengekomen, dat $ 17.820 000 het bedrag uitmaakt van de kosten der goederen en diensten, door bemiddeling van de Amerikaanse Departementen van Oorlog en Marine aan de Nederlandse Regering verstrekt, op voorwaarde van contante betaling, terwijl deze voorwaarde later niet door algemene lend-lease voorwaarden is vervangen, en die vallen onder de aanvragen voor lend-lease goederen, welke, toen zij door de Nederlandse Regering werden ingediend, direct contant betaald moesten worden, hieronder echter niet begrepen de direct bij de Amerikaanse Departementen van Marine aangevraagde lend-lease goederen. Het destijds door de Nederlandse Regering betaalde bedrag van $ 17.820.000 houdt een vergoeding in voor de nog niet opgegeven kosten, en is niet voor wijziging vatbaar. Bij het vaststellen der vordering volgens artikel 3 sub A (3) van deze overeenkomst, wordt met deze vergoeding geen rekening gehouden.  

C. De beide Regeringen zijn tot overeenstemming gekomen omtrent de regels en de werkwijze te volgen bij de betaling voor goederen en diensten, welke in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden aan de Amerikaanse strijdkrachten zijn verstrekt en voor bepaalde vliegtuigen, welke door de Amerikaanse strijdkrachten van de Nederlandse Regering in de Verenigde Staten zijn verkregen, alsmede bij de teruggave aan de Nederlandse Regering van zich in het bezit der Amerikaanse strijdkrachten bevindende guldens.  

D. De in aanhangsel 1 van deze overeenkomst opgesomde vorderingen behoren tot die, welke door deze overeenkomst worden geregeld, en bij de berekening van het netto-bedrag, dat door de Nederlandse Regering volgens artikel 1 sub A aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigd is, zijn hiervoor billijke vergoedingen toegekend.  

E. Overeenstemming is bereikt omtrent de navolgende regelingen inzake de tijd gedurende welke de grote, in aanhangsel 1 van deze overeenkomst omschreven, U.S. 7 (c) schepen en de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen, al naar het geval zich voordoet, ieder afzonderlijk door de Nederlandse Regering voor de Amerikaanse Regering werden geëxploiteerd tijdens de in aanhangsel 1 van deze overeenkomst omschreven 7 (c)-periode: 

(1) De Amerikaanse Regering zal de kosten dragen van alle tot nu toe niet door de Nederlandse Regering betaalde diensten en goederen, welke gedurende die periode door de Amerikaanse Regering aan de Nederlandse Regering verstrekt werden ten behoeve van de grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen en de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen.  

(2) De Nederlandse Regering zal alle inkomsten behouden, welke eventueel uit het vervoer tegen betaling van passagiers en vracht met de grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen en de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen gedurende die periode zijn verkregen.  

(3) De Nederlandse Regering zal alle vorderingen op de Amerikaanse Regering, of die, waarvoor de Amerikaanse Regering uiteindelijk aansprakelijk is, en welke onstaan zijn uit het gedurende die periode plaats gehad hebbende vervoer tegen betaling van passagiers en vracht met de grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen en met de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen, behandelen en zal de Amerikaanse Regering van de aansprakelijkheid daarvoor ontslaan, behalve in zover derde Regeringen dit reeds gedaan hebben zonder hiervoor contante vergoeding ontvangen te hebben.    

F. Zoals in aanhangsel 2 van deze overeenkomst nader is omschreven doen beide Regeringen afstand van hun wederzijdse vorderingen uit hoofde van inbeslagneming, ten dienste van de uitvoering van het oorlogsprogramma, van aan de eisende Regering toebehorende goederen, en behoudens het in artikel 3 sub A (5) dezer overeenkomst bepaalde, van al haar vorderingen jegens de andere, en al haar vorderingen, waarvoor de andere uiteindelijk aansprakelijk is, en die ontstaan zijn uit voorvallen in verband met de vaart ter zee op of na 10 Mei 1940 en voor 1 Juli 1946 plaats gevonden hebbende.  

G. Beide Regeringen doen afstand van alle andere wederzijdse financiële vorderingen, waarin niet op andere wijze in deze overeenkomst is voorzien, en welke 

(a) zijn ontstaan, of hierna zullen ontstaan ten gevolge van de uitvoering der leen- en pachtovereenkomst, of de uitvoering der overeenkomst tot wederkerige hulpverlening, of  

(b) op andere wijze zijn ontstaan uit voorvallen, welke op of na 10 Mei 1940 en voor 1 Juli 1946 plaats vonden in verband met, of ten gevolge van de oorlogvoering, behalve 

(1) vorderingen, welke ontstaan uit hoofde van bestaande regelingen, waarin de aansprakelijkheid reeds erkend en de wijze van berekening overeengekomen is;  

(2) vorderingen, welke ontstaan, doordat met goedkeuring van de Amerikaanse Regering na 31 December 1946 goederen door een derde Regering onder de leen- en pachtovereenkomst verkregen, aan de Nederlandse Regering worden overgedragen;  

(3) vorderingen, welke zijn ingediend volgens de methode, waarbij een regering een vordering van een harer onderdanen tot de hare maakt en langs diplomatieke weg bij een andere regering indient.        

4.  *Vorderingen van particulieren*  

A. De Nederlandse Regering zal de in dit artikel, sub 1 tot 4, omschreven vorderingen behandelen en zal de Amerikaanse Regering van de aansprakelijkheid daarvoor ontslaan, evenals de private en rechtspersonen, waartegen de hieromschreven vorderingen worden ingediend, behalve in zover derde regeringen dit reeds hebben gedaan zonder hiervoor contante vergoeding ontvangen te hebben, n.l.: 

(1) vorderingen op de Amerikaanse Regering, of waarvoor de Amerikaanse Regering uiteindelijk aansprakelijk is, uit hoofde van voorvallen, in verband met de vaart ter zee (waaronder die, welke in aanhangsel 2 van deze overeenkomst nader zijn omschreven), op of na 10 Mei 1940 en vóór 1 Juli 1946 plaats gevonden hebbende, welke bij rechtbanken in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden zijn, of spoedig worden ingediend, of waar dan ook zijn ingediend door private of rechtspersonen, zijnde onderdanen van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden ten tijde van het voorval, waaruit de vordering is ontstaan; behalve de vorderingen van Nederlandse onderdanen, welke gebaseerd zijn op de diensten, door hen verricht als zeeman. Tevens zal de Nederlandse Regering, als onderdeel van de algemene overeenkomst, zonder dat dit aan de zijde van de Amerikaanse Regering tot enige financiële verplichting aanleiding geeft, op verzoek van de Amerikaanse Regering, die maatregelen nemen, die nodig kunnen zijn, waaronder het aanvaarden van de financiële aansprakelijkheid, het vrijgeven van de, aan de Amerikaanse Regering toebehorende, schepen en ladingen in geval van rechterlijke maatregelen, welke dienen om dergelijke vorderingen geldend te maken.  

(2) Vorderingen van private en rechtspersonen, welke te eniger tijd tussen 10 Mei 1940 en 2 September 1945 in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden gedomicilieerd waren (met uitzondering van personen, die uitsluitend Amerikaans onderdaan zijn) op de Amerikaanse Regering, haar contractanten of ondercontractanten, met betrekking tot royalties, voortvloeiende uit contracten betreffende het gebruik van al dan niet geoctrooieerde uitvindingen, of uit hoofde van inbreuken op octrooirechten, in verband met de oorlogsproductie, voor 2 September 1945 door de Amerikaanse Regering haar contractanten of ondercontractanten verricht, of gecontracteerd.  

(3) Al dan niet contractuele vorderingen op de Amerikaanse Regering, en op leden harer strijdkrachten, en het daaraan verbonden burger personeel, welke voortvloeien uit op het grondgebied van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, zowel in als buiten dienst, gepleegde handelingen of nalatigheden van de leden dier strijdkrachten, of het daaraan verbonden burger personeel, welke voorzover het contracten betreft, hebben plaats gevonden op of na 10 Mei 1940 en vóór 2 September 1945 en welke, voorzover het andere handelingen of nalatigheden betreft, hebben plaats gevonden op of na 10 Mei 1940 en vóór 1 Juli 1946.

B. Voor de door de Nederlandse Regering in artikel 4 sub A, van deze overeenkomst aangegane verplichtingen is een billijke vergoeding toegekend bij de samenstelling van het netto bedrag van $ 67.500.000, hetwelk ingevolge artikel 1 sub A, van deze overeenkomst door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigd is.    

5.  *Overtollige legergoederen*  

A. De beide Regeringen komen overeen, dat hun rechten en verplichtingen in verband met het destijds door de Amerikaanse Regering verleende crediet tot een bedrag van $ 30.000.000 (oorspronkelijk $ 20.000 000) voor de aankoop van overtollige legergoederen, door deze overeenkomst worden bepaald; voorts dat de door de United States Central Field Commissioner for Europe, Office of the Foreign Liquidation Commissioner, aan de Nederlandse Thesaurier-Generaal gerichte, door de Nederlandse Regering accoord bevonden, brieven van 14 Mei 1946 en 9 December 1946, waarin het crediet werd vastgesteld, alsmede latere mededelingen in deze, door deze overeenkomst worden teniet gedaan. Eenzelfde bepaling betreffende de rechten en verplichtingen in verband met het destijds door de Amerikaanse Regering aan de Nederlandsch-Indische Regering verleende crediet van $ 100.000.000 voor de aankoop van overtollige legergoederen is opgenomen in een afzonderlijke overeenkomst, welke tegelijk met deze overeenkomst door de Amerikaanse Regering en de Nederlandsch-Indische Regering is getekend.  

B. De voorwaarden voor de betaling van het bedrag, verschuldigd ingevolge het crediet van $ 30.000.000, zullen luiden als bepaald in artikel 6 van deze overeenkomst. Als een onderdeel van de algemene hierbij gemaakte regeling stemt de Amerikaanse Regering in deze wijziging van de oorspronkelijke betalingsvoorwaarden toe, en in de gelijke wijziging met betrekking tot het crediet van $ 100.000.000, verleend in de afzonderlijke overeenkomst, welke tegelijk met deze door de Amerikaanse Regering en de Nederlandsch-Indische Regering is getekend.  

C. Het crediet van $ 30.000.000 dient voor aankopen, vóór 1 Januari 1948, van door het Office of the Foreign Liquidation Commissioner beschikbaar gestelde Amerikaanse overtollige legergoederen, onverschillig waar deze zich bevinden.  

D. De reeds ten laste van het crediet van $ 30.000.000 geboekte bedragen zullen ten laste hiervan blijven vanaf de data, waarop zij respectievelijk geboekt werden, doch voor wat de vermeerdering met rente betreft, gelden de bepalingen van artikel 6 sub C, van deze overeenkomst. De massa verkopen van overtollige legergoederen in de gebiedsdelen Curaçao en Suriname zullen ten laste van het crediet van $ 30.000.000 gebracht worden.  

E. Reeds getroffen regelingen inzake de in verband met het crediet van $ 30.000.000 te volgen werkwijze blijven van kracht tot zij gewijzigd worden.    

6.  *Betalingsvoorwaarden*  

A. De Nederlandse Regering verbindt zich om, naarmate en wanneer de ingevolge artikel 3, sub A, te betalen bedragen door de Amerikaanse Regering worden voldaan, aan de Amerikaanse Regering gelijke bedragen in dollars te betalen, tot een totaal van $ 19.500.000, ter gedeeltelijke voldoening van de door haar aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigde totale hoofdsom.  

B. Het restant van de door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigde totale hoofdsom zal door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering worden betaald, in dollars, in dertig jaarlijkse termijnen, welke, te beginnen met 1 Juli 1951, telkens op 1 Juli van ieder jaar vervallen. De eerste termijn bedraagt een dertigste van het op 1 Juli 1951 nog te betalen gedeelte van de totale hoofdsom. Elke volgende termijn bedraagt zoveel van het op de termijndatum nog onbetaalde gedeelte van de totale hoofdsom, als nog niet eerder vervallen is, gedeeld door het aantal nog niet eerder vervallen termijnen.  

C. De Nederlandse Regering zal de Amerikaanse Regering rente betalen, in dollars, tegen een vaste rentevoet van 2 % per jaar over $ 50.000.000 (welk bedrag is overeengekomen als te zijn de netto som van dat gedeelte der schulden, die tezamen de totale hoofdsom uitmaken, dat betrekking heeft op het aan 1 Juli 1946 voorafgaande tijdvak) voor het tijdvak van 1 Juli 1946 tot en met 30 Juni 1947, en vanaf 1 Juli 1947 op het nog te betalen restant van de totale hoofdsom. Met betrekking tot de bedragen, die ten laste van het crediet van $ 30.000.000 geboekt zijn, zal evenwel rente verschuldigd zijn vanaf de eerste dag van de maand Juli volgende op de datum, waarop elk der bedragen is geboekt. Met betrekking tot het bedrag van enige vermindering van de totale hoofdsom, bedoeld in artikel 6 sub D, en artikel 7 van deze overeenkomst, zal de rente voor het tijdvak vanaf de voorafgaande eerste Juli slechts tot aan de datum van vermindering berekend worden. De rente is jaarlijks te betalen op 1 Juli, te beginnen met 1 Juli 1947.  

D. Door de Nederlandse Regering kunnen te allen tijde aan de Amerikaanse Regering, ingevolge deze overeenkomst, bedragen worden betaald, welke als dan niet vervallen zijn of groter zijn dan de vervallen bedragen. Zodanige betalingen worden eerst in aftrek gebracht op eventueel nog verschuldigde rente, vervolgens op eventueel vervallen aflossingstermijnen en dan op het nog te betalen restant van de totale hoofdsom.  

E. Indien de beide Regeringen in onderling overleg vaststellen dat, tengevolge van buitengewone en ongunstige economische omstandigheden tijdens de aflossingsperiode ontstaan, het gemeenschappelijk belang der beide Regeringen niet gediend zou zijn door een der periodieke betalingen van rente, of van aflossing op de hoofdsom, of van rente en aflossing op de hoofdsom, of van een gedeelte daarvan, kan betaling worden uitgesteld op nader overeen te komen voorwaarden.    

7.  *Verstrekking van gelden in Nederlands Courant en van goederen*  

A. De Nederlandse Regering zal, wanneer de Amerikaanse Regering dit verzoekt, door betaling aan de Amerikaanse Regering, of aan die personen, of organisaties, die de Amerikaanse Regering aanwijst, te allen tijde elk bedrag in Nederlands Courant beschikbaar stellen (berekend volgens het bepaalde in artikel 7 sub E van deze overeenkomst), doch niet meer dan het te dien tijde nog te betalen gedeelte van de totale hoofdsom plus de nog verschuldigde rente, voor: 

(1) De gehele of gedeeltelijke betaling van de gewone overheidsuitgaven, welke de Amerikaanse Regering, of een harer organen of vertegenwoordigers in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (met uitzondering van Nederlandsch-Indië) te doen heeft.  

(2) De verkrijging van onroerende goederen, derzelver verandering of inrichting, waaromtrent overeenstemming bestaat tussen de beide Regeringen.  

(3) De betaling van de kosten van onderwijsprogramma's waaromtrent overeenstemming bestaat tussen de beide Regeringen.    

B. Ingeval de Amerikaanse Regering enige lichamelijke of onlichamelijke zaak (gelegen binnen het Koninkrijk, doch niet in Nederlandsch-Indië), hetzij roerende dan wel onroerende, wenst te verkrijgen (mits niet voor export, tenzij met wederzijdse goedkeuring), of enig zich aldaar bevindend goed, waarop zij rechten kan doen gelden, wenst te veranderen of in te richten, zal de Nederlandse Regering te allen tijde op verzoek der Amerikaanse Regering in onderhandeling treden en voorzover dit met haar openbaar beleid verenigbaar is, al haar krachten inspannen om met de Amerikaanse Regering tot overeenstemming te geraken omtrent de levering aan de Amerikaanse Regering van de goederen, veranderingen of inrichtingen, welke de Amerikaanse Regering wenst, of welke de vertegenwoordigers der Amerikaanse Regering hebben uitgezocht. Daarbij staat het vertegenwoordigers der Amerikaanse Regering te hunner beoordeling vrij om rechtstreeks met de eigenaar dier goederen of met de aannemers der veranderingen of met de leveranciers der inrichtingen besprekingen te voeren aangaande redelijke voorwaarden en prijzen, alvorens de levering van die goederen, veranderingen of inrichtingen aan de Amerikaanse Regering geschiedt.  

C. De Amerikaanse Regering verklaart, dat zij thans voornemens is, op grond van artikel 7 sub A, van deze overeenkomst, beschikbaarstelling van gelden in Nederlands Courant aan te vragen voor overeengekomen onderwijsprogramma's tot een bedrag van $ 5.000.000, en dat zij eveneens voornemens is, op grond van artikel 7 sub A en B, van deze overeenkomst, beschikbaarstelling van gelden in Nederlands Courant aan te vragen voor de levering van onroerende goederen, veranderingen en inrichtingen, of wel beide tot een bedrag van $ 8.700.000. De verklaring van dit voornemen belet de Amerikaanse Regering niet in dit verband later voorstellen in te dienen voor bedragen, die van de hierbovengenoemde verschillen. Onder bovengenoemde bedragen zijn begrepen die, welke reeds zijn aangevraagd ingevolge overeenkomstige tot nu toe bestaande regelingen ten opzichte van het crediet van $ 30.000.000.  

D. De volgens artikel 7 sub E van deze overeenkomst berekende tegenwaarde in dollars van de beschikbaar gestelde gelden in Nederlands Courant en van de waarde in Nederlands Courant van goederen, veranderingen en inrichtingen, welke ingevolge artikel 7, of ingevolge overeenkomstige tot nu toe bestaande regelingen ten opzichte van het crediet van $ 30.000.000 geleverd zijn, zal eerst worden afgeboekt van eventueel verschuldigde rente, en vervolgens van aflossingstermijnen, welke krachtens deze overeenkomst eventueel nog aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigd zijn, en ten slotte van het nog te betalen restant van de, ingevolge deze overeenkomst, verschuldigde totale hoofdsom.  

E. De in Nederlands Courant beschikbaar gestelde gelden en de waarde in Nederlands Courant van goederen, veranderingen en inrichtingen, welke ingevolge artikel 7, of ingevolge overeenkomstige tot nu toe bestaande regelingen ten opzichte van het crediet van $ 30.000.000 geleverd zijn, zullen worden omgerekend tegen de pariteit tussen deze courant en dollars, als vastgesteld overeenkomstig de regelen van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, of, indien die pariteit niet bestaat, tegen de voor de Amerikaanse Regering voordeligste koers, ten tijde van het verzoek der Amerikaanse Regering om beschikbaarstelling van die gelden, of levering van die goederen, veranderingen of inrichtingen bij officiële transacties door de Nederlandse Regering toegepast.    

8.  *Zilver*  De verplichtingen der Nederlandse Regering ten aanzien van het zilver, dat haar door de Amerikaanse Regering onder de leen- en pachtovereenkomst is overgedragen, worden door deze overeenkomst niet beïnvloed.  

9.  *Overdracht van eigendomsrecht*  

A. Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 9 sub B en C van deze overeenkomst, ontvangen de Nederlandse Regering en de Amerikaanse Regering het volledig recht van eigendom, zonder enige restrictie ten aanzien van beschikking of gebruik, op alle in haar bezit zijnde, respectievelijk onder de leen- en pachtovereenkomst, of de overeenkomst tot wederkerige hulpverlening, aan haar verstrekte goederen, waaronder begrepen weder overgedragen lend-lease goederen, doch deze laatste slechts in zoverre als voor de wederoverdracht vóór 1 Januari 1947 toestemming door de Amerikaanse Regering werd verleend.  

B. Elk der beide Regeringen behoudt zich het recht voor op terugvordering van wapenen, munitie en oorlogstuig (als in aanhangsel 2 van deze overeenkomst nader omschreven), welke onder de leen- en pachtovereenkomst of onder de overeenkomst van wederkerige hulpverlening waren verstrekt, en welke zich op de datum, waarop een verzoek om teruggave aan de andere Regering wordt gedaan, in het bezit der andere Regering bevinden (een en ander met uitzondering van wapenen, munitie en oorlogstuig, geleverd volgens de leen- en pachtovereenkomst, op voorwaarde van contante betaling, welke voorwaarde later niet door algemene lend lease voorwaarden is vervangen); elk der beide Regeringen heeft evenwel te kennen gegeven, dat zij in het algemeen niet voornemens is haar recht op terugvordering van die goederen uit te oefenen. Zodanige goederen zullen in of voor gebruik in derde landen slechts verkocht worden met toestemming van de verstrekkende Regering en tegen betaling aan de verstrekkende Regering van de opbrengst uit de verkoop daarvan. Elk der beide Regeringen gaat er mede accoord, dat al de zodanige goederen, welke zij onder zich heeft, slechts gebruikt zullen worden volgens de in het Charter van de Verenigde Naties uiteengezette beginselen van internationale veiligheid en welvaart.  

C. In zoverre de Amerikaanse wet dit vereist, zullen marine- en koopvaardijschepen, die aan de Nederlandse Regering onder de leen- en pachtovereenkomst ter beschikking zijn gesteld, aan de Amerikaanse Regering worden teruggegeven.    

10.  *Diverse bepalingen*  

A. Waar in deze overeenkomst sprake is van goederen, geleverd ingevolge de leen- en pachtovereenkomst, of van overdrachten, ingevolge de leen- en pachtovereenkomst, worden hieronder begrepen de door de Amerikaanse Regering aan een derde ingevolge de leen- en pachtovereenkomst overgedragen goederen, welke door die derde regering weder aan de Nederlandse Regering zijn overgedragen.  

B. In zover de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst met die in enige vroegere overeenkomst onverenigbaar zijn, gelden de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst.  

C. De verplichting, welke op de Nederlandse Regering rust krachtens artikel IV van de, op octrooien betrekking hebbende, Voorlopige Overeenkomst van 8 Juli 1942, wordt door deze overeenkomst niet beïnvloed.  

D. De beide Regeringen komen overeen die speciale afspraken te maken, die nodig kunnen zijn om deze algemene overeenkomst ten uitvoer te brengen.

####Door deze overeenkomst tussen de beide Regeringen geregelde vorderingen

Zoals in artikel 3 sub D van deze overeenkomst vermeld, behoren de in dit aanhangsel genoemde vorderingen tussen de beide Regeringen tot die, welke door deze overeenkomst geregeld zijn, terwijl daarvoor een billijke vergoeding is toegekend bij de toerekening van het netto bedrag, hetwelk ingevolge artikel 1 sub A van deze overeenkomst door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering verschuldigd is. 

I.  *Vorderingen van de Nederlandse Regering*  Waar deze bewoordingen in deze overeenkomst voorkomen, wordt onder de term „grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen” verstaan de schepen, genoemd in de hieraan toegevoegde lijst I, en wordt onder de term „kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen" verstaan de schepen, genoemd in de hieraan toegevoegde lijst II. Al deze schepen behoren aanvankelijk tot die, welke ingevolge het „Memorandum inzake de Nederlandsch-Indische schepen-regeling” van 5 Juni 1942 door de Britse Minister van War Transport van de Nederlandse Regering gecharterd en aan de Amerikaanse Regering toegewezen werden. Het waren de schepen, die later, ingevolge de tussen de Nederlandse Ambassade te Washington en het Amerikaanse Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken gewisselde Nota's van 6 Juni 1945 en 31 Juli 1945, met goedkeuring van de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk uit genoemde regeling werden gelicht, waarna zij afzonderlijk door de Nederlandse Regering, overeenkomstig de Notawisseling, ten behoeve van de Amerikaanse Regering zijn geëxploiteerd gedurende de gehele (hierna omschreven) 7 (c)-periode, of wel vanaf het begin van de 7 (c)-periode, totdat zij tijdens de 7 (c) periode aan de Britse Regering werden toegewezen. De aanduiding „7 (c)” is afkomstig van het, op deze schepen van toepassing zijnde, artikel 7 (c), (2e zin) van de „Overeenkomst betreffende de beginselen met betrekking tot het gecoördineerd beheer der koopvaardij”, welke 5 Augustus 1944 te Londen werd getekend. In deze overeenkomst wordt onder de term „7 (c) periode” met betrekking tot de grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen en de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen, verstaan het tijdvak vanaf 23 Mei 1945, te middernacht, tot de datum van teruggave, van geval tot geval, aan de Nederlandse Regering, of tot 2 Maart 1946, indien de teruggave later plaats had. De in deze overeenkomst gebezigde term „ 5 Juni Memorandum” doelt op bovengenoemd Memorandum van 5 Juni 1942. 

A. De navolgende vorderingen van de Nederlandse Regering op de Amerikaanse Regering, met betrekking tot de grote U.S. 7 (c) schepen, behoren tot die, welke door deze overeenkomst geregeld zijn:

(ii) De vergoeding door de Amerikaanse Regering toegekend voor de vervanging der scheepsuitrusting, is berekend op grondslag van de in de respectievelijke inventarislijsten genoemde artikelen en op grondslag van de kosten van aanschaffing en installatie van die uitrusting in de respectievelijke herbouw havens.  

(iii) De vergoeding door de Amerikaanse Regering toegekend voor herbouw is o.a. verstrekt in de vorm van het verwijderen en als zodanig vervangen van gedurende de bouw aangebrachte uitrustingsdelen, en houdt rekening met een door de Nederlandse Regering aan de Amerikaanse Regering gegeven vergoeding voor de aan boord achtergelaten scheepsuitrusting der Amerikaanse Regering. Deze scheepsuitrusting wordt het eigendom der Nederlandse Regering.  

(iv) Onder de vergoeding door de Amerikaanse Regering toegekend voor heruitrusting, is begrepen de onder de oorlogsrisico-verzekering vallende schade aan de in deel A. van de hieraan toegevoegde lijst I genoemde schepen, voorzover die schade tijdens de 7 (c)-periode is geleden.

2. Herbouw en heruitrusting van de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen. De door de Nederlandse Regering ingediende vordering en de daarvoor door de Amerikaanse Regering toegekende vergoeding zijn beperkt tot de herbouw- en heruitrustingskosten, gemaakt tengevolge van het gebruik dezer schepen door de Amerikaanse Regering gedurende de 7 (c)-periode, en zijn berekend op een pro rata basis volgens door de Nederlandse Regering verstrekte cijfers betreffende de algehele herbouw en heruitrustingskosten, ontstaan vanaf de datum, waarop deze schepen op grond van de desbetreffende cherte-partijen, in 1942 werden geleverd. Bij deze vordering worden alle rechten voorbehouden met betrekking tot vorderingen wegens bijkomende herbouw- en heruitrustingskosten ingevolge de als grondslag dienende cherte-partijen.  

3. De comptabiliteitsdiensten (bemiddelingsdiensten) ten behoeve van de kleine U.S. 7 (c) schepen, voorzover betreft het tijdvak, waarin zij afzonderlijk door de Nederlandse Regering voor de Amerikaanse Regering werden geëxploiteerd gedurende de 7 (c) periode.    

C. De navolgende overige op schepen betrekking hebbende vorderingen der Nederlandse Regering op de Amerikaanse Regering behoren tot die, welke door deze overeenkomst geregeld zijn: 

1. Een gedeelte der (niet door de Amerikaanse Marine) betaalde kosten van bewapening van bepaalde Nederlandse schepen, welke ingevolge het 5 Juni-Memorandum gecharterd en aan de Amerikaanse Regering toegewezen werden.  

2. De in dollars betaalbare 80 % van de huurverhoging voor schepen, welke ingevolge het 5 Juni-Memorandum gecharterd werden (welke huurverhogig een shilling per ton laadvermogen per maand bedraagt vanaf 1 Juli 1944 tot de teruggave van het schip en (tengevolge van het afstand doen van verzekering van niet in huur zijnde schepen) sixpence per ton laadvermogen per maand van 1 Juli 1944 tot 31 December 1944). De door de Amerikaanse Regering toegekende vergoeding voor deze vordering wordt door de Nederlandse Regering aanvaard ter voldoening van haar vordering, ingevolge het 5 Juni-Memorandum, voor de in dollars betaalbare 80 % van genoemde huurverhoging.  

3. Dollar-uitgaven voor vrije Nederlandse schepen in Amerikaanse havens tussen 21 Augustus 1941 en 30 September 1945, welke van dien aard zijn, dat zij ingevolge de bepalingen van de leen- en pachtwet, hiervoor in aanmerking komen.  

4. Huur ten bedrage van $ 180.000 voor, volgens „bareboat out-time charter back” regelingen, gecharterde schepen (welke vordering wordt ingetrokken in verband met de intrekking door de Amerikaanse Regering van haar vordering tot verlaging van huur voor ingevolge genoemde charter regeling gecharterde schepen).
