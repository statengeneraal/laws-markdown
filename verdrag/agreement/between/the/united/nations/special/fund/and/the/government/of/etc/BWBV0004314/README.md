New York, 24 mei 1963. Mijnheer, In verband met de heden tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en het Speciale Fonds der Verenigde Naties ondertekende Overeenkomst betreffende bijstand van het Speciale Fonds zou ik gaarne willen vastleggen dat ten aanzien van een aantal bepalingen van de Overeenkomst de volgende overeenstemming werd bereikt: *Artikel I, lid 2:* Het is wel verstaan dat de gedetailleerde uitwerking van de betrekkingen tussen de Regering van de Nederlandse Antillen, het Speciale Fonds en de uitvoerende instantie en van de van ieder van hen verwachte handelingen in het uitvoeringsplan zal worden vastgelegd. *Artikel IV, lid 2:* Het is wel verstaan dat de Regering van de Nederlandse Antillen de salarissen blijft betalen van personeel van de Regering van de Nederlandse Antillen dat werkzaam is aan een door het Speciale Fonds gesteund project, zelfs indien krachtens het uitvoeringsplan de kosten van de diensten van dit personeel beschouwd zouden worden als bijdrage van de Regering van de Nederlandse Antillen aan de uitvoering van een project. *Artikel VI:* Het is wel verstaan dat alle fondsen door de Nederlandse Antillen ontvangen of te ontvangen krachtens het zogenaamde Tienjarenplan zullen worden beschouwd als zijnde de fondsen van de Regering van de Nederlandse Antillen zelf en derhalve niet als bijstand in de zin van artikel VI.
