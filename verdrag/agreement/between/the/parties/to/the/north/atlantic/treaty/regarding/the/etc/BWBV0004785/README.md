(b) “civilian component” means the civilian personnel accompanying a force of a Contracting Party who are in the employ of an armed service of that Contracting Party, and who are not stateless persons, nor nationals of any State which is not a Party to the North Atlantic Treaty, nor nationals of, nor ordinarily resident in, the State in which the force is located;  

(c) “dependent” means the spouse of a member of a force or of a civilian component, or a child of such member depending on him or her for support;

### Article  II  

It is the duty of a force and its civilian component and the members thereof as well as their dependents to respect the law of the receiving State, and to abstain from any activity inconsistent with the spirit of the present Agreement, and, in particular, from any political activity in the receiving State.

However, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the military authorities of the sending State from trying a member of its force for any violation of rules of discipline arising from an act or omission which constituted an offence for which he was tried by the authorities of another Contracting Party.

(b) Outside these premises, such military police shall be employed only subject to arrangements with the authorities of the receiving State and in liaison with those authorities, and in so far as such employment is necessary to maintain discipline and order among the members of the force.     
11.  Each Contracting Party shall seek such legislation as it deems necessary to ensure the adequate security and protection within its territory of installations, equipment, property, records and official information of other Contracting Parties, and the punishment of persons who may contravene laws enacted for that purpose.   

### Article  VIII  

1.  Each Contracting Party waives all its claims against any other Contracting Party for damage to any property owned by it and used by its land, sea or air armed services, if such damage 

(i) was caused by a member or an employee of the armed services of the other Contracting Party in the execution of his duties in connexion with the operation of the North Atlantic Treaty; or  

(ii) arose from the use of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft owned by the other Contracting Party and used by its armed services, provided either that the vehicle, vessel or aircraft causing the damage was being used in connexion with the operation of the North Atlantic Treaty, or that the damage was caused to property being so used.   Claims for maritime salvage by one Contracting Party against any other Contracting Party shall be waived, provided that the vessel or cargo salved was owned by a Contracting Party and being used by its armed services in connextion with the operation of the North Atlantic Treaty.   
2.  

(a) In the case of damage caused or arising as stated in paragraph 1 to other property owned by a Contracting Party and located in its territory, the issue of the liability of any other Contracting Party shall be determined and the amount of damage shall be assessed, unless the Contracting Parties concerned agree otherwise, by a sole arbitrator selected in accordance with sub-paragraph *(b)* of this paragraph. The arbitrator shall also decide any counter-claims arising out of the same incident.  

(b) The arbitrator referred to in sub-paragraph *(a)* above shall be selected by agreement between the Contracting Parties concerned from amongst the nationals of the receiving State who hold or have held high judicial office. If the Contracting Parties concerned are unable, within two months, to agree upon the arbitrator, either may request the Chairman of the North Atlantic Council Deputies to select a person with the aforesaid qualifications.  

(c) Any decision taken by the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon the Contracting Parties.  

(d) The amount of any compensation awarded by the arbitrator shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 *(e)* (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Article.  

(e) The compensation of the arbitrator shall be fixed by agreement between the Contracting Parties concerned and shall, together with the necessary expenses incidental to the performance of his duties, be defrayed in equal proportions by them.  

(f) Nevertheless, each Contracting Party waives its claim in any such case where the damage is less than:

In the case of considerable variation in the rates of exchange between these currencies the Contracting Parties shall agree on the appropriate adjustments of these amounts.     
3.  For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article the expression “owned by a Contracting Party” in the case of a vessel includes a vessel on bare boat charter to that Contracting Party or requisitioned by it on bare boat terms or seized by it in prize (except to the extent that the risk of loss or liability is borne by some person other than such Contracting Party).   
4.  Each Contracting Party waives all its claims against any other Contracting Party for injury or death suffered by any member of its armed services while such member was engaged in the performance of his official duties.   
5.  Claims (other than contractual claims and those to which paragraphs 6 or 7 of this Article apply) arising out of acts or omissions of members of a force or civilian component done in the performance of official duty, or out of any other act, omission or occurrence for which a force or civilian component is legally responsible, and causing damage in the territory of the receiving State to third parties, other than any of the Contracting Parties, shall be dealt with by the receiving State in accordance with the following provisions: 

(a) Claims shall be filed, considered and settled or adjudicated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the receiving State with respect to claims arising from the activities of its own armed forces.  

(b) The receiving State may settle any such claims, and payment of the amount agreed upon or determined by adjudication shall be made by the receiving State in its currency.  

(c) Such payment, whether made pursuant to a settlement or to adjudication of the case by a competent tribunal of the receiving State, or the final adjudication by such a tribunal denying payment, shall be binding and conclusive upon the Contracting Parties.  

(d) Every claim paid by the receiving State shall be communicated to the sending States concerned together with full particulars and a proposed distribution in conformity with sub-paragraphs *(e)* (i), (ii) and (iii) below. In default of a reply within two months, the proposed distribution shall be regarded as accepted.  

(e) The cost incurred in satisfying claims pursuant to the preceding sub-paragraphs and paragraph 2 of this Article shall be distributed between the Contracting Parties, as follows: 

(i) Where one sending State alone is responsible, the amount awarded or adjudged shall be distributed in the proportion of 25 per cent, chargeable to the receiving State and 75 per cent, chargeable to the sending State.  

(ii) Where more than one State is responsible for the damage, the amount awarded or adjudged shall be distributed equally among them: however, if the receiving State is not one of the States responsible, its contribution shall be half that of each of the sending States.  

(iii) Where the damage was caused by the armed services of the Contracting Parties and it is not possible to attribute it specifically to one or more of those armed services, the amount awarded or adjudged shall be distributed equally among the Contracting Parties concerned: however, if the receiving State is not one of the States by whose armed services the damage was caused, its contribution shall be half that of each of the sending States concerned.  

(iv) Every half-year, a statement of the sums paid by the receiving State in the course of the half-yearly period in respect of every case regarding which the proposed distribution on a percentage basis has been accepted, shall be sent to the sending States concerned, together with a request for reimbursement. Such reimbursement shall be made within the shortest possible time, in the currency of the receiving State.    

(f) In cases where the application of the provisions of sub-paragraphs *(b)* and *(e)* of this paragraph would cause a Contracting Party serious hardship, it may request the North Atlantic Council to arrange a settlement of a different nature.  

(g) A member of a force or civilian component shall not be subject to any proceedings for the enforcement of any judgement given against him in the receiving State in a matter arising from the performance of his official duties.  

(h) Except in so far as sub-paragraph *(e)* of this paragraph applies to claims covered by paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any claim arising out of or in connexion with the navigation or operation of a ship or the loading, carriage, or discharge of a cargo, other than claims for death or personal injury to which paragraph 4 of this Article does not apply.     
6.  Claims against members of a force or civilian component arising out of tortious acts or omissions in the receiving State not done in the performance of official duty shall be dealt with in the following manner: 

(a) The authorities of the receiving State shall consider the claim and assess compensation to the claimant in a fair and just manner, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the injured person, and shall prepare a report on the matter.  

(b) The report shall be delivered to the authorities of the sending State, who shall then decide without delay whether they will offer an *ex gratia* payment, and if so, of what amount.  

(c) If an offer of *ex gratia* payment is made, and accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction of his claim, the authorities of the sending State shall make the payment themselves and inform the authorities of the receiving State of their decision and of the sum paid.  

(d) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State to entertain an action against a member of a force or of a civilian component unless and until there has been payment in full satisfaction of the claim.     
7.  Claims arising out of the unauthorised use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article, except in so far as the force or civilian component is legally responsible.   
8.  If a dispute arises as to whether a tortious act or ommission of a member of a force or civilian component was done in the performance of official duty or as to whether the use of any vehicle of the armed services of a sending State was unauthorised, the question shall be submitted to an arbitrator appointed in accordance with paragraph 2 *(b)* of this Article, whose decision on this point shall be final and conclusive.   
9.  The sending State shall not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State for members of a force or civilian component in respect of the civil jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State except to the extent provided in paragraph 5 *(g)* of this Article.   
10.  The authorities of the sending State and of the receiving State shall co-operate in the procurement of evidence for a fair hearing and disposal of claims in regard to which the Contracting Parties are concerned.   

### Article  IX  

1.  Members of a force or of a civilian component and their dependents may purchase locally goods necessary for their own consumption, and such services as they need, under the same conditions as the nationals of the receiving State.   
2.  Goods which are required from local sources for the subsistence of a force or civilian component shall normally be purchased through the authorities which purchase such goods for the armed services of the receiving State. In order to avoid such purchases having any adverse effect on the economy of the receiving State, the competent authorities of that State shall indicate, when necessary, any articles the purchase of which should be restricted or forbidden.   
3.  Subject to agreements already in force or which may hereafter be made between the authorised representatives of the sending and receiving States, the authorities of the receiving State shall assume sole responsibility for making suitable arrangements to make available to a force or a civilian component the buildings and grounds which it requires, as well as facilities and services connected therewith. These agreements and arrangements shall be, as far as possible, in accordance with the regulations governing the accommodation and billeting of similar personnel of the receiving State. In the absence of a specific contract to the contrary, the laws of the receiving State shall determine the rights and obligations arising out of the occupation or use of the buildings, grounds, facilities or services.   
4.  Local civilian labour requirements of a force or civilian component shall be satisfied in the same way as the comparable requirements of the receiving State and with the assistance of the authorities of the receiving State through the employment exchanges. The conditions of employment and work, in particular wages, supplementary payments and conditions for the protection of workers, shall be those laid down by the legislation of the receiving State. Such civilian workers employed by a force or civilian component shall not be regarded for any purpose as being members of that force or civilian component.   
5.  When a force or a civilian component has at the place where it is stationed inadequate medical or dental facilities, its members and their dependents may receive medical and dental care, including hospitalisation, under the same conditions as comparable personnel of the receiving State.   
6.  The receiving State shall give the most favourable consideration to requests for the grant to members of a force or of a civilian component of travelling facilities and concessions with regard to fares. These facilities and concessions will be the subject of special arrangements to be made between the Governments concerned.   
7.  Subject to any general or particular financial arrangements between the Contracting Parties, payment in local currency for goods, accommodation and services furnished under paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5 and 6, of this Article shall be made promptly by the authorities of the force.   
8.  Neither a force, nor a civilian component, nor the members thereof, nor their dependents, shall by reason of this Article enjoy any exemption from taxes or duties relating to purchases and services chargeable under the fiscal regulations of the receiving State.   

### Article  X  

1.  Where the legal incidence of any form of taxation in the receiving State depends upon residence or domicile, periods during which a member of a force or civilian component is in the territory of that State by reason solely of his being a member of such force or civilian component shall not be considered as periods of residence therein, or as creating a change of residence or domicile, for the purposes of such taxation. Members of a force or civilian component shall be exempt from taxation in the receiving State on the salary and emoluments paid to them as such members by the sending State or on any tangible movable property the presence of which in the receiving State is due solely to their temporary presence there.   
2.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent taxation of a member of a force or civilian component with respect to any profitable enterprise, other than his employment as such member, in which he may engage in the receiving State, and, except as regards his salary and emoluments and the tangible movable property referred to in paragraph 1, nothing in this Article shall prevent taxation to which, even if regarded as having his residence or domicile outside the territory of the receiving State, such a member is liable under the law of that State.   
3.  Nothing in this Article shall apply to “duty” as defined in paragraph 12 of Article XI.   
4.  For the purposes of this Article the term “member of a force” shall not include any person who is a national of the receiving State.   

### Article  XI  

1.  Save as provided expressly to the contrary in this Agreement, members of a force and of a civilian component as well as their dependents shall be subject to the laws and regulations administered by the customs authorities of the receiving State. In particular the customs authorities of the receiving State shall have the right, under the general conditions laid down by the laws and regulations of the receiving State, to search members of a force or civilian component and their dependents and to examine their luggage and vehicles, and to seize articles pursuant to such laws and regulations.   
2.  

(a) The temporary importation and the re-exportation of service vehicles of a force or civilian component under their own power shall be authorised free of duty on presentation of a triptyque in the form shown in the Appendix to this Agreement.  

(b) The temporary importation of such vehicles not under their own power shall be governed by paragraph 4 of this Article and the re-exportation thereof by paragraph 8.  

(c) Service vehicles of a force or civilian component shall be exempt from any tax payable in respect of the use of vehicles on the roads.     
3.  Official documents under official seal shall not be subject to customs inspection. Couriers, whatever their status, carrying these documents must be in possession of an individual movement order, issued in accordance with paragraph 2 *(b)* of Article III. This movement order shall show the number of despatches carried and certify that they contain only official documents.   
4.  A force may import free of duty the equipment for the force and reasonable quantities of provisions, supplies and other goods for the exclusive use of the force and, in cases where such use is permitted by the receiving State, its civilian component and dependents. This duty-free importation shall be subject to the deposit, at the customs office for the place of entry, together with such customs documents as shall be agreed, of a certificate in a form agreed between the receiving State and the sending State signed by a person authorised by the sending State for that purpose. The designation of the person authorised to sign the certificates as well as specimens of the signatures and stamps to be used, shall be sent to the customs administration of the receiving State.   
5.  A member of a force or civilian component may, at the time of his first arrival to take up service in the receiving State or at the time of the first arrival of any dependent to join him, import his personal effects and furniture free of duty for the term of such service.   
6.  Members of a force or civilian component may import temporarily free of duty their private motor vehicles for the personal use of themselves and their dependents. There is no obligation under this Article to grant exemption from taxes payable in respect of the use of roads by private vehicles.   
7.  Imports made by the authorities of a force other than for the exclusive use of that force and its civilian component, and imports, other than those dealt with in paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Article, effected by members of a force or civilian component are not, by reason of this Article, entitled to any exemption from duty or other conditions.   
8.  Goods which have been imported duty-free under paragraphs 2 *(b),* 4, 5 or 6 above 

(a) may be re-exported freely, provided that, in the case of goods imported under paragraph 4, a certificate, issued in accordance with that paragraph, is presented to the customs office: the customs authorities, however, may verify that goods re-exported are as described in the certificate, if any, and have in fact been imported under the conditions of paragraphs 2 *(b)*, 4, 5 or 6 as the case may be;  

(b) shall not normally be disposed of in the receiving State by way of either sale or gift: however, in particular cases such disposal may be authorised on conditions imposed by the authorities concerned of the receiving State (for instance, on payment of duty and tax and compliance with the requirements of the controls of trade and exchange).     
9.  Goods purchased in the receiving State shall be exported therefrom only in accordance with the regulations in force in the receiving State.   
10.  Special arrangements for crossing frontiers shall be granted by the customs authorities to regularly constituted units or formations, provided that the customs authorities concerned have been duly notified in advance.   
11.  Special arrangements shall be made by the receiving State so that fuel, oil and lubricants for use in service vehicles, aircraft and vessels of a force or civilian component, may be delivered free of all duties and taxes.   
12.  In paragraphs 1-10 of this Article “duty” means customs duties and all other duties and taxes payable on importation or exportation, as the case may be, except dues and taxes which are no more than charges for services rendered; “importation” includes withdrawal from customs warehouses or continuous customs custody, provided that the goods concerned have not been grown, produced or manufactured in the receiving State.   
13.  The provisions of this Article shall apply to the goods concerned not only when they are imported into or exported from the receiving State, but also when they are in transit through the territory of a Contracting Party, and for this purpose the expression “receiving State” in this Article shall be regarded as including any Contracting Party through whose territory the goods are passing in transit.   

### Article  XII  

1.  The customs or fiscal authorities of the receiving State may, as a condition of the grant of any customs or fiscal exemption or concession provided for in this Agreement, require such conditions to be observed as they may deem necessary to prevent abuse.   
2.  These authorities may refuse any exemption provided for by this Agreement in respect of the importation into the receiving State of articles grown, produced or manufactured in that State which have been exported therefrom without payment of, or upon repayment of, taxes or duties which would have been chargeable but for such exportation. Goods removed from a customs warehouse shall be deemed to be imported if they were regarded as having been exported by reason of being deposited in the warehouse.   

### Article  XIII  

1.  In order to prevent offences against customs and fiscal laws and regulations, the authorities of the receiving and of the sending States shall assist each other in the conduct of enquiries and the collection of evidence.   
2.  The authorities of a force shall render all assistance within their power to ensure that articles liable to seizure by, or on behalf of, the customs or fiscal authorities of the receiving State are handed to those authorities.   
3.  The authorities of a force shall render all assistance within their power to ensure the payment of duties, taxes and penalties payable by members of the force or civilian component or their dependents.   
4.  Service vehicles and articles belonging to a force or to its civilian component, and not to a member of such force or civilian component, seized by the authorities of the receiving State in connexion with an offence against its customs or fiscal laws or regulations shall be handed over to the appropriate authorities of the force concerned.   

### Article  XIV  

1.  A force, a civilian component and the members thereof, as well as their dependents, shall remain subject to the foreign exchange regulations of the sending State and shall also be subject to the regulations of the receiving State.   
2.  The foreign exchange authorities of the sending and the receiving States may issue special regulations applicable to a force or civilian component or the members thereof as well as to their dependents.

b. „dienst”: het burgerpersoneel, hetwelk een krijgsmacht van een Verdragsluitende Partij vergezelt en dat in dienst is bij een der strijdkrachten van die Verdragsluitende Partij, met uitzondering van staatloze personen of onderdanen van een Staat, welke niet partij is bij het Noord Atlantisch Verdrag, of onderdanen van de Staat, waarin de krijgsmacht zich bevindt, of personen, die aldaar hun verblijfplaats plegen te hebben;  

c. „gezinslid”: de echtgeno(o)t(e) van een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, of een kind van zodanig lid, dat van hem of haar afhankelijk is voor zijn onderhoud;  

d. „staat van herkomst”: de Verdragsluitende Partij waartoe de krijgsmacht behoort;  

e. „Staat van verblijf”: de Verdragsluitende Partij, op wier grondgebied de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst zich bevindt, hetzij dat deze aldaar gelegerd is, hetzij dat deze zich op doortocht bevindt;  

f. „militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst”: die autoriteiten van een Staat van herkomst, welke krachtens de wetgeving van die Staat bevoegd zijn tot toepassing van de militaire wetten van die Staat met betrekking tot de leden van zijn krijgsmachten of civiele diensten;

### Artikel  II  

Een krijgsmacht, haar civiele dienst, de leden daarvan, alsmede hun gezinsleden zijn gehouden de wetten van de Staat van verblijf te eerbiedigen en zich te onthouden van elk optreden in strijd met de geest van dit Verdrag en in het bijzonder van elke politieke activiteit in de Staat van verblijf. De Staat van herkomst is mede gehouden de hiertoe noodzakelijke maatregelen te nemen.  

### Artikel  III  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht zijn, onverminderd de voorwaarden, neergelegd in lid 2 van dit Artikel en op voorwaarde van nakoming van de formaliteiten, welke door de Staat van verblijf met betrekking tot in- en uitreis van een krijgsmacht of de leden daarvan worden vastgesteld, niet onderworpen aan voorschriften met betrekking tot paspoorten en visa en aan inspectie door immigratiediensten bij het binnenkomen of verlaten van het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf. Zij zijn evenmin onderworpen aan de voorschriften van de Staat van verblijf terzake van registratie en controle van vreemdelingen, doch worden niet geacht enig recht op voortdurend verblijf of op woonplaats te verwerven in de gebieden van de Staat van verblijf.   
2.  Voor leden van een krijgsmacht zijn uitsluitend de volgende documenten vereist. Zij moeten op verzoek worden getoond:

4.  Indien een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst de dienst van de Staat van herkomst verlaat en niet naar zijn eigen land terugkeert, doen de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst hiervan onmiddellijk mededeling aan de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf onder opgave van alle gewenste bijzonderheden. De autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst doen op gelijke wijze mededeling aan de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf van ieder geval van onwettige afwezigheid van meer dan 21 dagen.   
5.  Indien de Staat van verblijf verzocht heeft een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst van zijn grondgebied te verwijderen of een bevel tot uitwijzing heeft uitgevaardigd tegen een voormalig lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of tegen een gezinslid van een lid of voormalig lid, zijn de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst verplicht de betrokken persoon op hun eigen grondgebied toe te laten dan wel in ieder geval hem het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf te doen verlaten. Dit lid is slechts van toepassing op personen, die geen onderdaan zijn van de Staat van verblijf en die deze Staat zijn binnengekomen als leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of met het doel dit te worden, alsmede op de gezinsleden van zodanige personen.   

### Artikel  IV  

De Staat van verblijf zal:

b. hetzij, zonder onderzoek, het eigen rijbewijs afgeven aan elk lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, dat houder is van een burgerlijk of militair rijbewijs, afgegeven door de Staat van herkomst of een van zijn samenstellende delen.    

### Artikel  V  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht dragen in de regel uniform. Behalve wanneer tussen de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst en de Staat van verblijf het tegendeel mocht zijn overeengekomen, wordt burgerkleding gedragen onder dezelfde voorwaarden, als gelden voor de leden van de strijdkrachten van de Staat van verblijf. Geregelde eenheden of formaties van een krijgsmacht dragen uniform bij het overschrijden van de grens.   
2.  Dienstvoertuigen van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst voeren naast hun registratienummer een kenteken ter aanduiding van hun nationaliteit.   

### Artikel  VI  

Leden van een krijgsmacht mogen wapens in hun bezit hebben en dragen, mits de op hen toepasselijke voorschriften zulks toestaan. De autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst nemen verzoeken van de Staat van verblijf te dezer zake in welwillende overweging.  

### Artikel  VII  

1.  Behoudens de bepalingen van dit artikel hebben 

a. de militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst het recht op het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf de bevoegdheden op strafrechtelijk en krijgstuchtelijk gebied uit te oefenen, welke de wetgeving van de Staat van herkomst hun toekent, over alle personen, die aan de militaire wetten van die Staat onderworpen zijn;  

b. de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf rechtsmacht over de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en hun gezinsleden met betrekking tot vergrijpen, welke zijn begaan op het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf en strafbaar zijn volgens de wetten van die Staat.     
2.  

a. De Militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst hebben bij uitsluiting het recht rechtsmacht uit te oefenen over personen, die aan de militaire wetten van die Staat onderworpen zijn met betrekking tot vergrijpen – met inbegrip van vergrijpen tegen de veiligheid van die Staat – welke wel volgens de wetten van de Staat van herkomst, doch niet volgens de wetten van de Staat van verblijf strafbaar zijn.  

b. De autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf hebben bij uitsluiting het recht rechtsmacht uit te oefenen over de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en hun gezinsleden met betrekking tot vergrijpen – met inbegrip van vergrijpen tegen de veiligheid van die Staat – welke wel volgens de eigen wetten, doch niet volgens de wetten van de Staat van herkomst strafbaar zijn.  

c. Voor de toepassing van dit lid en van lid 3 van dit Artikel wordt onder een vergrijp tegen de veiligheid van de Staat begrepen: 

1. landverraad;  

2. sabotage, spionnage of schending van de wetgeving met betrekking tot staatsgeheimen of geheimen betreffende de nationale defensie van die Staat.       
3.  In gevallen van samenloop van rechtsmacht zijn de volgende regels van toepassing: 

a. De militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst hebben voorrang bij de uitoefening van rechtsmacht over een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst met betrekking tot: 

1. vergrijpen welke uitsluitend gericht zijn tegen de eigendommen of de veiligheid van die Staat, of vergrijpen welke uitsluitend gericht zijn tegen de persoon of eigendommen van een ander lid van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst van die Staat of van een gezinslid;  

2. vergrijpen, welke voortvloeien uit enige daad of nalatigheid, begaan in de uitoefening van de dienst.    

b. In geval van enig ander vergrijp hebben de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf voorrang bij de uitoefening van rechtsmacht.  

c. Indien de Staat, welke voorrang heeft, besluit niet tot uitoefening van rechtsmacht over te gaan, stelt hij de autoriteiten van de andere Staat zo spoedig mogelijk daarvan in kennis. De autoriteiten van de Staat, welke voorrang heeft, nemen het verzoek van de autoriteiten van de andere Staat om van dit recht af te zien in gevallen, waarin die andere Staat zulks van bijzonder belang acht, in welwillende overweging.     
4.  De bepalingen van dit artikel verlenen aan de militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst geen enkel recht tot uitoefening van rechtsmacht over personen, die onderdanen zijn van of hun voortdurend verblijf hebben in de Staat van verblijf, tenzij zij leden zijn van de krijgsmacht van de Staat van herkomst.   
5.  

a. De autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf en van de Staat van herkomst verlenen elkander hulp bij het in arrest stellen van leden van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst of van hun gezinsleden op het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf en bij het overleveren van hen aan de autoriteit, die rechtsmacht zal uitoefenen in overeenstemming met bovenstaande bepalingen.  

b. De autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf stellen de militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst terstond in kennis van het in arrest stellen van enig lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of van een gezinslid.  

c. De bewaking van een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, waarover de Staat van verblijf rechtsmacht zal uitoefenen, zal blijven berusten bij de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst, totdat tegen hem een vervolging wordt ingesteld door de Staat van verblijf.     
6.  

a. De autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf en van de Staat van herkomst verlenen elkander hulp bij de uitvoering van alle noodzakelijke nasporingen ter zake van vergrijpen en bij het bijeenbrengen van bewijsmateriaal, met inbegrip van het inbeslagnemen en in daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen het overdragen van voorwerpen, welke in verband staan met het vergrijp. Het overdragen van deze voorwerpen kan evenwel afhankelijk worden gesteld van teruggave daarvan binnen de tijd hiervoor vastgesteld door de autoriteit, die de voorwerpen overdraagt.  

b. De autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen stellen elkander in kennis van de afdoening van alle gevallen, waarin samenloop van rechtsmacht bestaat.     
7.  

a. Een doodvonnis wordt niet ten uitvoer gelegd in de Staat van verblijf door de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst, indien de wetgeving van de Staat van verblijf in een overeenkomstig geval zodanige straf niet kent.  

b. De autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf nemen een verzoek van de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst om bijstand bij de ten uitvoerlegging van een gevangenisstraf, welke op het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf is opgelegd door de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel, in welwillende overweging.     
8.  Wanneer een verdachte overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Artikel door de autoriteiten van een Verdragsluitende Partij is berecht en is vrijgesproken, of is veroordeeld en zijn straf ondergaat of heeft ondergaan of gratie heeft verkregen mag hij niet nogmaals voor hetzelfde vergrijp binnen hetzelfde grondgebied worden berecht door de autoriteiten van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij. De bepalingen van dit lid beletten de militaire autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst echter geenszins om een lid van zijn krijgsmacht te berechten ter zake van een schending van de voor zijn militairen als zodanig geldende voorschriften, welke schending voortvloeide uit een handelen of een nalaten, hetwelk het vergrijp vormde, waarvoor hij door de autoriteiten van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij werd berecht.   
9.  Wanneer een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid, vallend onder de rechtsmacht van de Staat van verblijf, door deze wordt vervolgd, heeft hij het recht: 

a. snel te worden berecht;  

b. vóór de aanvang van de terechtzitting in kennis te worden gesteld van de tegen hem uitgebrachte beschuldiging of beschuldigingen;  

c. geconfronteerd te worden met de getuigen à charge;  

d. getuigen à décharge tot verschijning te doen dwingen, indien de bevoegdheid van de rechter van de Staat van verblijf zich daartoe uitstrekt;  

e. hetzij naar eigen keuze, hetzij overeenkomstig de op dat ogenblik in de Staat van verblijf geldende wettelijke bepalingen te zijner verdediging te worden bijgestaan;  

f. indien hij zulks noodzakelijk acht, op de dienst van een bevoegde tolk;  

g. zich in verbinding te stellen met een vertegenwoordiger van de Regering van de Staat van herkomst en, wanneer het procesrecht zulks toelaat, op de aanwezigheid van deze vertegenwoordiger ter terechtzitting.     
10.  

a. Geregelde militaire eenheden of formaties van een krijgsmacht hebben het recht in ieder kamp, inrichting of ander gebouw, hetwelk zij op grond van een overeenkomst met de Staat van verblijf in gebruik hebben, politietoezicht uit te oefenen. De militaire politie van de krijgsmacht is bevoegd alle vereiste maatregelen te nemen ter verzekering van de handhaving van orde en veiligheid in zodanige gebouwen.  

b. Buiten deze gebouwen doet deze militaire politie slechts dienst op grond van overeenkomsten met de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf en in samenwerking met deze autoriteiten en voor zover deze dienst noodzakelijk is ter handhaving van tucht en orde onder de leden van de krijgsmacht.     
11.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij zal er naar streven die wettelijke maatregelen tot stand te brengen, welke zij noodzakelijk acht teneinde een behoorlijke beveiliging en bescherming binnen haar grondgebied van de installaties, het materieel, de eigendommen, archieven en officiële documenten van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, alsmede de bestraffing van inbreuken op deze wetgeving, te verzekeren.   

### Artikel  VIII  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij doet afstand van al haar vorderingen tegen een andere Verdragsluitende Partij terzake van schade aan haar eigendommen, in gebruik bij haar land-, zee- of luchtstrijdkrachten, indien deze schade 

a. veroorzaakt is door een lid of een werknemer van de strijdkrachten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij in de uitoefening van zijn dienst voor zover deze geschiedt in het kader van het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag, of  

b. ontstond door het gebruik van een voertuig, vaartuig of luchtvaartuig, eigendom van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij en in gebruik bij haar strijdkrachten, mits het voertuig, vaartuig of luchtvaartuig, hetwelk de schade veroorzaakte, gebruikt werd in het kader van het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag, dan wel de schade werd toegebracht aan eigendom, hetwelk aldus in gebruik was.   Van vorderingen ter zake van berging, welke een Verdragsluitende Partij tegen een andere Verdragsluitende Partij heeft, wordt afstand gedaan, mits het geborgen vaartuig of de geborgen lading, eigendom was van een Verdragsluitende Partij en in gebruik was bij diens strijdkrachten in het kader van het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag.   
2.  

a. Voor het geval schade wordt veroorzaakt of ontstaat overeenkomstig het bepaalde in lid 1 met betrekking tot andere eigendommen van een Verdragsluitende Partij, gelegen in haar grondgebied, wordt de aansprakelijkheid voor en het bedrag van de schade, tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen anders overeenkomen, vastgesteld door één arbiter, verkozen overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder *b* van dit lid. De arbiter neemt eveneens een beslissing omtrent eventuele tegen vorderingen, voortvloeiende uit hetzelfde voorval.  

b. De arbiter, bedoeld onder *a*, wordt in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen gekozen uit onderdanen van de Staat van verblijf, die een hoge rechterlijke functie bekleden of hebben bekleed. Indien de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen niet in staat zijn binnen twee maanden tot overeenstemming te komen over de benoeming van de arbiter, kan elk van beiden het verzoek richten tot de Voorzitter van de Raad van Plaatsvervangers van het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag om een persoon te kiezen, die aan bovenvermelde vereisten voldoet.  

c. Elke uitspraak van de arbiter is beslissend en bindend voor de Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

d. Het bedrag van elke schadeloosstelling, toegekend door de arbiter, wordt verdeeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 5, sub *e*, onder 1, 2 en 3, van dit Artikel.  

e. De beloning van de arbiter wordt in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen vastgesteld en te zamen met de noodzakelijke uitgaven, verbonden aan de uitoefening van zijn functie, voor gelijke delen door hen gedragen.  

f. Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij doet echter afstand van zijn vordering in alle gevallen, waarin de schade minder bedraagt dan: 

België: B.fr. 70.000  

Canada: $ 1.460  

Denemarken: Kr. 9.670  

Frankrijk: F.fr. 490.000  

IJsland: Kr. 22.800  

Italië: Li. 850.000  

Luxemburg: L.fr. 70.000  

Nederland: f 5.320  

Noorwegen: Kr. 10.000  

Portugal: Es 40.250  

Verenigd Koninkrijk: £ 500  

Verenigde Staten: $ 1.400   Iedere andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wier eigendom bij hetzelfde voorval beschadigd is, doet eveneens afstand van haar vordering tot bovengenoemd bedrag. Indien aanzienlijke verschillen optreden in de betrokken wisselkoersen, zullen de Verdragsluitende Partijen in onderlinge overeenstemming de bovengenoemde bedragen daaraan aanpassen.     
3.  Voor de toepassing van de leden 1 en 2 van dit Artikel omvat de uitdrukking „eigendom van een Verdragsluitende Partij”, voor het geval het een vaartuig betreft, een vaartuig „on bare boat charter” bij die Verdragsluitende Partij of onder „bare boat” voorwaarden door deze gevorderd of door deze prijs gemaakt (behoudens voor zover het risico voor verlies of aansprakelijkheid wordt gedragen door een ander dan die Verdragsluitende Partij).   
4.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij doet afstand van al haar vorderingen tegen een andere Verdragsluitende Partij voor het geval, dat een lid van haar strijdkrachten in de uitoefening van zijn dienst letsel oploopt of overlijdt.   
5.  Vorderingen (behoudens vorderingen uit overeenkomst en behoudens die vorderingen, waarop de leden 6 en 7 van dit artikel van toepassing zijn), voortvloeiende uit een handelen of nalaten van leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst in de uitoefening van de dienst, of uit enig ander handelen, nalaten of gebeuren waarvoor een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst wettelijk aansprakelijk is, en welke schade toebrengt op het grondgebied van de Staat van verblijf aan derden, niet zijnde één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen, worden door de Staat van verblijf behandeld overeenkomstig de volgende bepalingen: 

a. de vorderingen worden ingediend, behandeld en afgedaan overeenkomstig de wetten en regelingen van de Staat van verblijf met betrekking tot vorderingen voortvloeiende uit de daden van zijn eigen strijdkrachten;  

b. de Staat van verblijf is bevoegd deze vorderingen af te wikkelen; het bedrag, waarover men overeenstemming heeft bereikt of hetwelk toegekend is door de rechter, wordt door de Staat van verblijf in zijn eigen geldsoort uitbetaald;  

c. deze betaling, hetzij op grond van een minnelijke schikking, hetzij op grond van een uitspraak van de bevoegde rechter van de Staat van verblijf, dan wel de uitspraak van zulk een rechter, waarbij de eis wordt ontzegd, is beslissend en bindend voor de Verdragsluitende Partijen;  

d. van iedere vordering, betaald door de Staat van verblijf, wordt kennis gegeven aan de betrokken Staat van herkomst, onder mededeling van alle bijzonderheden en van een voorstel tot verdeling overeenkomstig het hierna onder *e*, 1, 2 en 3 bepaalde. Bij gebreke van een antwoord binnen 2 maanden wordt het voorstel tot verdeling geacht te zijn aanvaard;  

e. de kosten, gemaakt ter voldoening van vorderingen ingevolge hetgeen is bepaald in het voorgaande van dit lid en in lid 2 van dit artikel, worden als volgt over de Verdragsluitende Partijen verdeeld: 

1. wanneer uitsluitend één Staat van herkomst aansprakelijk is wordt het bedrag van de schadevergoeding in dier voege verdeeld, dat 25% ten laste komt van de Staat van verblijf en 75% ten laste van de Staat van herkomst;  

2. wanneer meer dan één Staat aansprakelijk is voor de schade, wordt het bedrag gelijkelijk over hen verdeeld; wanneer echter de Staat van verblijf niet één der aansprakelijke Staten is, is het aandeel van deze Staat gelijk aan de helft van dat van elk der Staten van herkomst;  

3. wanneer de schade veroorzaakt is door de strijdkrachten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen, doch onmogelijk nauwkeurig aan een of meer van deze strijdkrachten kan worden toegeschreven, wordt het bedrag van de schadeloosstelling gelijkelijk over de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen verdeeld; indien evenwel de Staat van verblijf niet is één van de Staten, wier strijdkrachten de schade hebben veroorzaakt, is het aandeel van deze Staat de helft van dat van elk der Staten van herkomst;  

4. elk half jaar zendt de Staat van verblijf bij de betrokken Staten van herkomst een lijst in van de bedragen, welke in de loop van de voorafgaande halfjaarlijkse periode zijn betaald met betrekking tot alle gevallen, waarvoor een percentsgewijze verdeling is aanvaard, vergezeld van een verzoek om terugbetaling. De terugbetaling geschiedt binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd in de geldsoort van de Staat van verblijf;    

f. wanneer de toepassing van het bepaalde onder *b* en *e* van dit lid een Verdragsluitende Partij in ernstige moeilijkheden zou brengen, kan deze de Noord-Atlantische Raad verzoeken een regeling van andere aard te treffen;  

g. een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst kan niet worden onderworpen aan een executie-maatregel ter uitvoering van een vonnis, hetwelk in de Staat van verblijf tegen hem gewezen is in een zaak, die voortvloeit uit de vervulling van zijn dienst;  

h. behoudens voor zover het bepaalde onder e van dit lid van toepassing is op vorderingen, vallende onder lid 2 van dit artikel, zijn de bepalingen van dit lid niet van toepassing op een vordering, welke voortvloeit uit of in verband staat met de navigatie of exploitatie van een schip of het laden, vervoeren of lossen van een lading, voor zover deze vorderingen niet zijn vorderingen terzake van dood of persoonlijk letsel, waarop lid 4 van dit artikel niet van toepassing is.     
6.  Vorderingen tegen leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, voortvloeiend uit onrechtmatig handelen of nalaten binnen de Staat van verblijf niet in de uitoefening van de dienst, worden op de volgende wijze behandeld: 

a. de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf behandelen de vordering en stellen op rechtvaardige en billijke wijze de schadeloosstelling van de eiser vast, waarbij zij alle omstandigheden van het geval, met inbegrip van het gedrag van de persoon die schade heeft geleden, in aanmerking nemen en stellen terzake een rapport op;  

b. het rapport wordt gezonden aan de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst, die dan zonder verwijl beslissen of zij een onverplichte uitkering aanbieden, en in bevestigend geval, tot welk bedrag;  

c. indien een aanbieding tot een onverplichte uitkering is gedaan en door de eiser als volledige vergoeding van zijn vordering aanvaard, doen de autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst zelf de betaling en stellen de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf in kennis van hun beslissing en van het bedrag dat zij hebben betaald;  

d. het bepaalde in dit lid laat onverlet de bevoegdheid van de rechter van de Staat van verblijf tot kennisneming van een vordering tegen een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst tenzij en totdat betaling heeft plaats gevonden tot volledige voldoening van de vordering.     
7.  Vorderingen, voortvloeiend uit het ongeoorloofd gebruik van een voertuig van de strijdkrachten van een Staat van herkomst, worden behandeld in overeenstemming met lid 6 van dit artikel, behalve voor zover de krijgsmacht of civiele dienst wettelijk aansprakelijk is.   
8.  Indien een geschil ontstaat met betrekking tot de vraag of een onrechtmatig handelen of nalaten van een lid van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst plaats heeft gevonden in de uitoefening van de dienst of met betrekking tot de vraag of het gebruik van een voertuig van de strijdkrachten van een Staat van herkomst ongeoorloofd was, wordt de zaak voorgelegd aan een arbiter benoemd in overeenstemming met § 2, onder *b*, van dit artikel, wiens uitspraak op dit punt als einduitspraak wordt aangemerkt.   
9.  De Staat van herkomst zal geen beroep doen op immuniteit ten opzichte van de rechtsmacht van de rechter van de Staat van verblijf voor leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst met betrekking tot de civiele rechtsmacht van de rechter van de Staat van verblijf, behoudens voor zover deze is beperkt door het bepaalde in lid 5, onder *g*, van dit artikel.   
10.  De autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst en van de Staat van verblijf zullen samenwerken bij het verzamelen van bewijsmateriaal voor een behoorlijk onderzoek van en beschikken op vorderingen waarbij de Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn betrokken.   

### Artikel  IX  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en hun gezinsleden mogen op dezelfde voorwaarden als de onderdanen van de Staat van verblijf ter plaatse goederen kopen, nodig voor eigen gebruik, en aldaar gebruik maken van diensten, waaraan zij behoefte hebben.   
2.  Goederen, welke ter plaatse worden betrokken voor de ravitaillering van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, moeten in de regel worden gekocht door tussenkomst van de autoriteiten, die dergelijke goederen kopen voor de strijdkrachten van de Staat van verblijf. Teneinde te verhinderen, dat deze aankopen een schadelijke invloed hebben op het economisch leven in de Staat van verblijf, zullen de bevoegde autoriteiten van deze Staat, indien zulks nodig is, artikelen aanwijzen, welker aankoop dient te worden beperkt of verboden zal zijn.   
3.  Behoudens het bepaalde in overeenkomsten, welke reeds van kracht zijn of in de toekomst mochten worden gesloten tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staat van herkomst en van de Staat van verblijf, zijn de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf uitsluitend verantwoordelijk voor het nemen van gepaste maatregelen voor het ter beschikking stellen aan een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst van de benodigde gebouwen en terreinen en de verlening van faciliteiten en diensten, welke daarmede verband houden. Deze overeenkomsten en maatregelen zullen zoveel mogelijk overeenstemmen met de voorschriften betreffende huisvesting en inkwartiering van overeenkomstig personeel van de Staat van verblijf. Bij gebreke van een overeenkomst, welke het tegendeel bepaalt, worden de rechten en verplichtingen welke voortvloeien uit het gebruik maken van gebouwen, terreinen, faciliteiten en diensten, beheerst door de wetten van de Staat van verblijf.   
4.  In de plaatselijke behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst aan burgerarbeidskrachten wordt op gelijke wijze voorzien als in de overeenkomstige behoeften van de Staat van verblijf, met medewerking van de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf door tussenkomst van de arbeidsbureaux. De arbeidsvoorwaarden, in het bijzonder de lonen en toeslagen, alsmede de maatregelen ter bescherming van arbeiders, worden vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van de Staat van verblijf. Zodanige burgerarbeidskrachten in dienst van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst worden in geen enkel opzicht beschouwd als leden van deze krijgsmacht of van deze civiele dienst.   
5.  Indien een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst, ter plaatse waar deze is gelegerd, onvoldoende mogelijkheden voor geneeskundige of tandheelkundige verzorging heeft, kunnen hun leden en de gezinsleden daarvan geneeskundige en tandheelkundige verzorging, met inbegrip van verpleging in hospitalen, ontvangen op dezelfde voorwaarden als overeenkomstig personeel van de Staat van verblijf.   
6.  De Staat van verblijf zal verzoeken om aan leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst faciliteiten op het gebied van reizen en reducties op vervoerkosten te verlenen in zeer welwillende overweging nemen. Deze faciliteiten en reducties zullen het onderwerp uitmaken van door de betrokken Regeringen te treffen bijzondere regelingen.   
7.  Behoudens een algemene of bijzondere financiële regeling tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen, worden betalingen in plaatselijke geldsoort voor goederen, huisvesting en diensten, bedoeld in de leden 2, 3, 4 en zo nodig 5 en 6, van dit Artikel, onverwijld gedaan door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht.   
8.  Een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, leden daarvan of hun gezinsleden ontlenen aan dit artikel geen aanspraak op enige vrijstelling van belastingen of andere heffingen, welke krachtens de belastingvoorschriften van de Staat van verblijf terzake van koop en verkoop van goederen en het verrichten van diensten worden geheven.   

### Artikel  X  

1.  Indien het onderworpen zijn aan enige vorm van belasting in de Staat van verblijf afhankelijk is van verblijf, van woonplaats of van ingezetenschap, worden voor de heffing van zodanige belasting de tijdvakken, gedurende welke een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst aanwezig is op het grondgebied van deze Staat uitsluitend uit hoofde van zijn hoedanigheid van lid van een zodanige krijgsmacht of civiele dienst, niet beschouwd als tijdvakken van verblijf of van woonplaats aldaar, noch beschouwd verandering van verblijf, van woonplaats of van ingezetenschap te weeg te brengen. Leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst zijn in de Staat van verblijf vrijgesteld van belastingen op het salaris en de emolumenten, welke aan hen in die hoedanigheid worden uitbetaald door de Staat van herkomst, alsmede van belastingen op roerende lichamelijke zaken, waarvan de aanwezigheid in de Staat van verblijf uitsluitend voortvloeit uit de tijdelijke aanwezigheid aldaar van deze leden.   
2.  Dit artikel stelt een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst in geen enkel opzicht vrij van belastingheffing terzake van op voordeel gerichte handelingen – andere dan de dienst, welke het lid als zodanig uitoefent – welke hij verricht in de Staat van verblijf, en de bepalingen van dit artikel – behalve voor zoveel zijn salaris, zijn emolumenten en de roerende lichamelijke zaken, vermeld in het eerste lid, betreft – verzetten zich in geen enkel opzicht tegen de heffing van belastingen, waaraan zodanig lid krachtens de wet van de Staat van verblijf is onderworpen, ook al wordt hij geacht zijn verblijf of zijn woonplaats buiten het grondgebied van die Staat te hebben, dan wel geen ingezetene van die Staat te zijn.   
3.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing op „rechten” in de zin van lid 12 van artikel XI.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel is onder de uitdrukking „lid van een krijgsmacht” niet begrepen een persoon, die de nationaliteit bezit van de Staat van verblijf.   

### Artikel  XI  

1.  Behoudens voor zover in dit Verdrag uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, zijn leden van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst evenals hun gezinsleden onderworpen aan de wetten en voorschriften, welke worden toegepast door de douane-administratie van de Staat van verblijf. De douane-ambtenaren van de Staat van verblijf hebben in het bijzonder het recht, met inachtneming van de algemene voorwaarden door de wetten en voorschriften van de Staat van verblijf vastgesteld, leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en hun gezinsleden aan den lijve te onderzoeken en hun bagage en voertuigen te visiteren. Zij hebben eveneens het recht overeenkomstig vorenbedoelde wetten en voorschriften goederen in beslag te nemen.   
2.  

a. Tijdelijke invoer en wederuitvoer van geregistreerde dienstvoertuigen, welke toebehoren aan een krijgsmacht of aan een civiele dienst en welke zich op eigen kracht voortbewegen, zijn toegestaan vrij van rechten op vertoon van een triptiek, waarvan het model is opgenomen in de Bijlage bij dit Verdrag.  

b. Tijdelijke invoer van geregistreerde dienstvoertuigen, welke zich niet op eigen kracht voortbewegen, vindt plaats overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel en wederuitvoer van die voertuigen overeenkomstig het achtste lid.  

c. Voor geregistreerde dienstvoertuigen, welke aan een krijgsmacht of aan een civiele dienst toebehoren, wordt eveneens vrijstelling genoten van iedere belasting, verschuldigd terzake van het berijden van wegen met voertuigen.     
3.  Officiële documenten in officieel verzegelde omslag zijn niet onderworpen aan visitatie door de douane. De koeriers, die deze documenten overbrengen, moeten, ongeacht hun status, zijn voorzien van een individuele reiswijzer, uitgereikt overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letter *b*, van artikel III. Deze reiswijzer moet het aantal omslagen vermelden en de verklaring bevatten, dat hun inhoud slechts uit officiële documenten bestaat.   
4.  Een krijgsmacht kan haar uitrusting en redelijke hoeveelheden proviand, materiaal en andere goederen, uitsluitend bestemd voor gebruik door die krijgsmacht en – in gevallen, waarin dit door de Staat van verblijf wordt toegestaan – voor gebruik door haar civiele dienst en door de gezinsleden, vrij van rechten invoeren. Voor de bedoelde vrije invoer geldt als voorwaarde, dat tezamen met de douanedocumenten waaromtrent overeenstemming is bereikt, op het douanekantoor een attest wordt overgelegd, in een tussen de Staat van verblijf en de Staat van herkomst overeengekomen vorm, ondertekend door een persoon, die daartoe door de Staat van herkomst is gemachtigd. De aanwijzing van de persoon, die is gemachtigd tot het tekenen van de attesten, alsmede specimina van zijn handtekening en van de stempels, welke worden gebruikt, worden toegezonden aan de douane-administratie van de Staat van verblijf.   
5.  Een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst kan bij eerste aankomst in de Staat van verblijf om aldaar dienst te gaan doen, of bij eerste aankomst van een van zijn gezinsleden, die zich bij hem komt voegen, zijn persoonlijke goederen en huisraad invoeren met vrijstelling van rechten voor de duur van zijn dienstuitoefening.   
6.  Leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst kunnen particuliere motorvoertuigen, bestemd voor persoonlijk gebruik door henzelf en door hun gezinsleden met tijdelijke vrijstelling van rechten invoeren. Deze bepaling brengt niet de verplichting mede vrijstelling te verlenen van belastingen, welke verschuldigd mochten zijn terzake van het gebruik van wegen met particuliere voertuigen.   
7.  Bij invoer door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht van goederen, welke niet uitsluitend bestemd zijn voor gebruik door deze krijgsmacht en haar civiele dienst en bij invoer door de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst van andere goederen dan zijn bedoeld in het vijfde en zesde lid van dit artikel, wordt op grond van dit artikel generlei vrijstelling van rechten of van formaliteiten verleend.   
8.  Goederen, welke op grond van het tweede lid, onder *b*, het vierde, vijfde of zesde lid van dit artikel vrij van rechten zijn ingevoerd: 

a. kunnen vrij weder worden uitgevoerd, op voorwaarde, dat ten aanzien van goederen, welke zijn ingevoerd op grond van het vierde lid, op het douanekantoor een overeenkomstig dat lid afgegeven attest wordt overgelegd. De douane-ambtenaren behouden echter het recht te controleren of de wederuitgevoerde goederen overeenkomen met de omschrijving in het attest, indien zodanig attest is vereist, en of zij werkelijk zijn ingevoerd met inachtneming van de voorwaarden genoemd in het tweede lid, onder *b*, het vierde, vijfde of zesde lid, al naar het geval zich voordoet;  

b. mogen in het algemeen in de Staat van verblijf niet worden overgedragen hetzij onder bezwarende titel, hetzij om niet. In bijzondere gevallen kan evenwel machtiging worden verkend voor een dergelijke overdracht onder door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf gestelde voorwaarden (b.v. het betalen van rechten en andere heffingen en het voldoen aan de formaliteiten verbonden aan de controle op de buitenlandse handel en de deviezen).     
9.  De uitvoer van in de Staat van verblijf gekochte goederen is onderworpen aan de in deze Staat van kracht zijnde voorschriften.   
10.  De douane-autoriteiten verlenen bijzondere faciliteiten met betrekking tot de grensoverschrijding van geregelde eenheden of formaties, onder voorwaarde, dat de desbetreffende douane-autoriteiten vooraf tijdig zijn ingelicht.   
11.  Door de Staat van verblijf worden bijzondere regelingen getroffen, opdat brandstof en smeermiddelen bestemd voor gebruik in geregistreerde dienstvoertuigen, luchtvaartuigen en oorlogsschepen van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst vrij van alle rechten en andere heffingen kunnen worden geleverd.   
12.  Voor de toepassing van de eerste tien leden van dit artikel worden onder „rechten” verstaan invoerrechten en alle andere rechten en heffingen verschuldigd terzake van invoer of uitvoer, al naar het geval zich voordoet, met uitzondering van rechten en heffingen, welke een vergoeding zijn voor bewezen diensten; onder „invoer” is mede begrepen uitslag naar het vrije verkeer van goederen, welke in een entrepot of onder een soortgelijk douane-regime zijn opgeslagen, onder voorwaarde, dat de betrokken goederen niet zijn geoogst, voortgebracht of vervaardigd in de Staat van verblijf.   
13.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn op de betrokken goederen niet alleen van toepassing, indien zij worden ingevoerd in de Staat van verblijf of uit die Staat worden uitgevoerd, maar ook, indien zij over het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat worden doorgevoerd. In laatstbedoeld geval omvat de uitdrukking „Staat van verblijf” in dit artikel iedere Verdragsluitende Partij over welks grondgebied de goederen worden doorgevoerd.   

### Artikel  XII  

1.  Elke vrijstelling of faciliteit van douanetechnische of van fiscale aard op grond van dit Verdrag verleend, is afhankelijk van de naleving van de bepalingen, welke de douane- of belastingautoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf ter voorkoming van misbruik noodzakelijk mochten achten.   
2.  Dezelfde autoriteiten kunnen beslissen, dat in dit Verdrag voorziene vrijstellingen niet worden genoten bij de invoer van producten, welke zijn geoogst, voortgebracht of vervaardigd in de Staat van verblijf en van te voren zijn uitgevoerd met vrijstelling of met terugbetaling van de rechten en andere heffingen, welke verschuldigd zouden zijn geweest, indien die producten niet zouden zijn uitgevoerd. Deze bepaling is mede van toepassing op goederen, welke zijn uitgeslagen uit een entrepot, indien de opslag in dat entrepot als uitvoer is beschouwd.   

### Artikel  XIII  

1.  Ter voorkoming van inbreuk op de wetten en voorschriften van douanetechnische of van fiscale aard, verlenen de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf en van de Staat van herkomst elkaar hun medewerking bij het instellen van onderzoeken en het verzamelen van bewijsmateriaal.   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht verlenen met alle hun ten dienste staande middelen medewerking, opdat de goederen, welke voor inbeslagneming door of ten behoeve van de douane- of belastingautoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf in aanmerking komen, aan deze autoriteiten worden overgedragen.   
3.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht verlenen met alle hun ten dienste staande middelen medewerking, opdat de rechten, heffingen en boeten, verschuldigd door leden van deze krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst of door hun gezinsleden, worden betaald.   
4.  Goederen en geregistreerde dienstvoertuigen, welke toebehoren aan een krijgsmacht of aan haar civiele dienst en niet aan een lid van zodanige krijgsmacht of civiele dienst, en welke door de autoriteiten van de Staat van verblijf terzake van een douane- of belastingovertreding in beslag zijn genomen, worden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van die krijgsmacht overgedragen.   

### Artikel  XIV  

1.  Een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst, de leden daarvan, alsmede hun gezinsleden, blijven onderworpen aan de deviezenbepalingen van de Staat van herkomst en zijn tevens onderworpen aan de desbetreffende bepalingen van de Staat van verblijf.

### Artikel  XV  

1.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in lid 2 van dit artikel blijft dit Verdrag van kracht bij het uitbreken van vijandelijkheden waarop het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag van toepassing is. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen inzake de regeling van vorderingen in de leden 2 en 5 van artikel VIII niet van toepassing op oorlogsschade en worden de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en in het bijzonder van de artikelen III en VII terstond opnieuw in beschouwing genomen door de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen, die zodanige wijziging kunnen overeenkomen als zij met betrekking tot de wederzijdse toepassing van het Verdrag wenselijk achten.   
2.  Bij het uitbreken van bovenbedoelde vijandelijkheden heeft ieder van de Verdragsluitende Partijen het recht met inachtneming van een termijn van zestig dagen en onder kennisgeving aan de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen de toepassing van elke bepaling van dit Verdrag voor zover haar betreft te schorsen. Indien dit recht wordt uitgeoefend zullen de Verdragsluitende Partijen elkander terstond raadplegen, teneinde overeenstemming te bereiken over passende bepalingen ter vervanging van de geschorste bepalingen.   

### Artikel  XVI  

Alle geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag worden door onderhandelingen tussen hen geregeld zonder beroep op enig rechterlijk orgaan buiten de organisatie van het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag. Behoudens voor zover in dit Verdrag uitdrukkelijk het tegendeel wordt bepaald, worden geschillen, die niet door rechtstreekse onderhandelingen kunnen worden opgelost, verwezen naar de Noord-Atlantische Raad.  

### Artikel  XVII

### Artikel  XVIII

3.  Afhankelijk van de goedkeuring van de Noord-Atlantische Raad en van de voorwaarden, die deze daartoe kan vaststellen, zal dit Verdrag, nadat het in werking is getreden, opengesteld zijn voor toetreding van iedere Staat, die tot het Noord-Atlantisch Verdrag toetreedt. Toetreding zal plaats vinden door het nederleggen van een akte van toetreding bij de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, welke elke ondertekenende en toetredende Staat mededeling zal doen van de datum van nederlegging.

3.  De opzegging wordt van kracht één jaar na ontvangst van de mededeling door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika. Na verloop van deze periode van een jaar houdt het Verdrag op van kracht te zijn met betrekking tot de Verdragsluitende Partij, die het opzegt, maar het blijft van kracht voor de overige Verdragsluitende Partijen.
