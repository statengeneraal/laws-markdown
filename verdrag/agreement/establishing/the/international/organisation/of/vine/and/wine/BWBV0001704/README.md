##Verdrag tot oprichting van de Internationale Organisatie voor Wijnbouw en Wijnbereiding

####Agreement establishing the International Organisation of Vine and Wine

Preamble Through an international Agreement concluded on 29 November 1924, the Governments of Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Tunisia gathered to create an International Wine Office. Following a decision of its member states on 4 September 1958, the office was renamed International Vine and Wine Office. This intergovernmental organisation has, at the date of 3 April 2001, forty-five member states. The General Assembly of the International Vine and Wine Office, in its resolution COMEX 2/97, made at its session of 5 December 1997, held in Buenos Aires (Argentina), decided to proceed, as necessary, with the adaptation of the International Vine and Wine Office to the new international environment. This involved adapting its missions, its human, material and budgetary resources and, as appropriate, its procedures and operating rules, in order to meet the challenges and secure the future of the world vine and wine sector. In application of Article 7 of the above-mentioned Agreement the Government of the French Republic, following a request from 36 member states, convened a Conference of member states on 14, 15, 22 June 2000 and on 3 April 2001 in Paris. To this end the member states of the International Vine and Wine Office, hereafter referred to as the Parties, have agreed to the following:     
### CHAPTER  I

6.  The headquarters of the Organisation shall be in Paris (France).   

### CHAPTER  III  

####VOTING RIGHTS

### Article  4  

Each member shall determine the number of its delegates but shall have only two basic votes plus, where relevant, an additional number of votes calculated from objective criteria that determine the relative position of each member state in the vine and wine sector under the conditions set forth in Annexes 1 and 2 to this Agreement, which form an integral part thereof. The sum of these two figures shall constitute the number of weighted votes. The coefficient determining the situation of each member state within the vine and wine sector shall be updated on a regular basis in accordance with provisions in Annex 1.  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####WORKING METHODS, DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES

### Article  5  

1.  The General Assembly shall be the supreme organ of the O.I.V. It shall discuss and adopt regulations relating to the organisation and working of the O.I.V and draft resolutions of a general, scientific, technical, economic or legal nature, as well as for the creation or discontinuance of Commissions and Sub-Commissions. It shall decide the budget for receipts and expenditures within the limit of existing appropriations, and shall audit and approve the accounts. The General Assembly shall adopt co-operation and collaboration protocols on matters relating to vine and wine products that the O.I.V may conclude with international organisations. It shall meet once a year. Extraordinary sessions may be convened at the request of one-third of O.I.V members.   
2.  Delegates from one-third of the members representing at least half the weighted votes must be present for sessions to be quorate. A member may be represented by the delegation of another member, but a delegation may not represent more than one member.   
3. 
a) Consensus shall be the normal method whereby the General Assembly shall adopt draft resolutions of a general, scientific, technical, economic or legal nature, and for the creation or discontinuance of Commissions and Sub-Commissions. The same shall be true for the Executive Committee when it exercises its functions on these issues.  

b) Consensus shall not be required for the election of the President of the O.I.V, the Presidents of Commissions and Sub-Commissions or for the Director General, nor shall it apply to the budget or to member's financial contributions. Moreover it shall not apply to other financial decisions as determined in the Internal Rules.  

c) In cases where the General Assembly or Executive Committee do not reach a consensus at the first instance on a draft resolution or decision, the President shall take all initiatives to consult members in the intervening period before the next General Assembly or Executive Committee, in order to bring the points of view together. When all such efforts to achieve consensus have been exhausted, the President shall take a vote on the basis of a qualified majority, that being a vote of two thirds plus one of members present or represented, on a one member one vote basis. Nevertheless, the vote shall be postponed for a period of one year if a member considers that its essential national interests are at risk. If the opposition is subsequently confirmed in writing by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or any other competent political authority of the member concerned, the vote shall not be taken.     
4.  

a) The O.I.V President, the Presidents of Commissions and Sub-Commissions and the Director General shall be elected by a weighted qualified majority vote, that is, two thirds plus one of the weighted votes of members present or represented, provided that half plus one of the members present or represented have voted for the candidate. Should these conditions not be met, an extraordinary session of the General Assembly shall be convened within a maximum of three months. The existing President, Presidents of Commissions and Sub-Commissions and Director General shall remain in office during the interim period, depending on the case.  

b) The O.I.V President, the Presidents of the Commissions and Sub-Commissions shall be elected for three-year terms. The Director General shall be elected for a five-year term of office; the Director General may be re-elected for a second five-year term under the same conditions as for his or her election. The General Assembly may remove the Director General, on the basis of both the weighted qualified majority and the majority of member states used for his or her election.     
5.  A weighted qualified majority vote, that being two thirds plus one of the weighted votes of members present or represented, shall apply to votes on the budget or to members' financial contributions. The General Assembly shall nominate a financial auditor, under the same conditions, on a joint proposal from the Director General and the O.I.V Steering Committee with the favourable opinion of the Executive Committee.   
6.  The official languages shall be French, Spanish and English. The corresponding funding shall be determined according to Annex 2 to this Agreement. Nevertheless, the General Assembly may adapt it, if necessary, under the conditions defined in Article 5, paragraph 3.a. At the request of one or more members, other languages shall be added according to the same methods of funding, notably Italian and German, in order to improve communication between members. Beforehand, the concerned users shall formally accept the new financial contributions that result from their request. Beyond a total of five languages, any new request shall be submitted to the General Assembly which shall take its decision in accordance with the conditions defined in Article 5, paragraph 3.a. French shall remain the reference language in the event of any dispute with third parties who are not members of the Organisation.   
7.  The constitutive bodies of the O.I.V shall function in an open and transparent manner.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####FUNDING OF THE O.I.V.

### Article  6  

1.  Every member of the O.I.V shall pay a financial contribution decided each year by the General Assembly, the amount of which shall be determined by applying the provisions of Annexes 1 and 2 to this Agreement. The General Assembly shall decide the financial contribution of any new members on the basis of the provisions of Annexes 1 and 2 to this Agreement.   
2.  The O.I.V's financial resources shall comprise the annual compulsory contribution of each member and observer and income from its own activities. Compulsory payments shall be paid to the O.I.V during the calendar year concerned. Beyond that time, payment shall be deemed late.   
3.  The O.I.V's financial resources may also include voluntary contributions from its members, donations, grants, subsidies or payments of any kind from international and national organisations of a public, semi-public or private nature, provided such payments are made in accordance with guidelines which shall be established by the General Assembly in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 3.a and shall be included in the Internal Rules.   

### Article  7  

1.  Should a member fail to pay two contributions its voting rights and participation, in the next Executive Committee meeting and General Assembly after such failure has been ascertained, shall be automatically suspended. The Executive Committee shall determine, on a case by case basis, the conditions under which the member concerned may regularise its situation or, failing that, be deemed to have denounced the Agreement.   
2.  In the case that three successive contributions have not been paid, the Director General shall notify the member or observer concerned of this situation. If the situation is not regularised during the two years following the thirty-first of December of the third year, the member or the observer concerned shall be automatically excluded.   

### CHAPTER  VI  

####PARTICIPATION OF INTERNATIONAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS

### Article  8

### Annex  1  

####referred to in Articles 4 and 6 of this Agreement

*Method for determining the position of each member state in the vine and wine sector*   

### 1  

Objective criteria determining the relative position of each member state in the vine and wine sector: 

a) Average production of wines, special wines, musts, grape- or wine-based spirits (expressed in wine equivalents) over the last five-year period for which statistics are available, stripping out the two extreme values (P);  

b) Average total surface area of the vineyard in the last three-year period for which statistics are available (S);  

c) Average apparent consumption of wine and wine equivalents over the last three years for which statistics are available (C) = (P) production – E (exports) + I (imports)    

### 2  

Formula for determining the coefficient for each member state:   ![10000025014](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000025014)

### 3  

The coefficient of each member state is updated: 

a) at the start of the budget year following the accession of a new member;  

b) every three years in light of the most recent available statistics.    

### 4  

New members: New members joining the O.I.V in future years must pay a compulsory financial contribution calculated according tot the formula defined in the present Annex, with the addition of their participation to the specific funding for languages, in the conditions fixed in Annex 2.  

### Annex  2  

####referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement

*Method for determining member states' voting rights, compulsory financial contributions and methods for language funding*   

### 1  

Basic votes: Each member state has two basic votes.  

### 2  

Additional votes: The total number of additional votes is equal to half the total number of basic votes. Up to such amount, additional votes are allocated as appropriate, in addition to basic votes, to certain member states according to their relative position in the vine and wine sector, according to the formula given in Annex 1.  

### 3  

Weighted votes: The number of each member state's weighted votes is equal to the sum of its basic votes and additional votes, if any.  

### 4  

Allocation of compulsory contributions: The total amount of compulsory contributions to be paid by members is calculated on the basis of the budget adopted by the General Assembly. One-third of the total amount of compulsory contributions is divided equally between the basic votes. Two-thirds of the total amount of compulsory contributions are divided in proportion to additional votes. In order to facilitate the transition between the former and present Agreement, the financial contribution corresponding to the two basic votes of each member state may not be lower, for the first budget year, than the ``Unit of contribution" prior to the present Agreement entering into force. If necessary, the amount of financial contributions for additional votes are adjusted consequently to reach the total amount of compulsory contributions fixed by the adopted budget.  

### 5  

Funding of languages: The funding of languages is fully provided for in the general budget of the O.I.V and without any specific contribution by each linguistic group composed of members and observer users. The detailed arrangements for implementing languages shall be determined by appropriate provisions in the Internal Rules.

v. de media en het grote publiek.   Teneinde deze informatie- en communicatiefunctie te faciliteren, verzoekt de OIV haar leden, potentiële begunstigden en, indien van toepassing, internationale organisaties, haar informatie en gegevens te verstrekken op basis van redelijke verzoeken;  

o. het regelmatig toetsen van de doeltreffendheid van haar structuren en procedures.     

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####ORGANISATIE

### Artikel  3  

1.  De organen van de OIV zijn: 

a. de Algemene Vergadering;  

b. de Voorzitter;  

c. de Vice-Voorzitters;  

d. de Directeur-Generaal;  

e. het Uitvoerend Comité;  

f. het Wetenschappelijk en Technisch Comité;  

g. De Stuurgroep;  

h. commissies, subcommissies en van deskundigengroepen;  

i. het Secretariaat.     
2.  Elk lid van de OIV wordt vertegenwoordigd door afgevaardigden van zijn keuze. De Algemene Vergadering, samengesteld uit door de leden benoemde afgevaardigden, is het plenaire orgaan van de OIV. De Algemene Vergadering kan sommige van haar taken delegeren aan het Uitvoerend Comité, dat een afgevaardigde per lid omvat. Het Uitvoerend Comité kan, onder zijn gezag, sommige van zijn routinematige administratieve taken overdragen aan de OIV-Stuurgroep, die is samengesteld uit de Voorzitter en Vice-Voorzitters van de OIV en de Voorzitters van de OIV-commissies en -subcommissies. De Voorzitter, de eerste Vice-Voorzitter en de Voorzitters van commissies hebben een verschillende nationaliteit.   
3.  De wetenschappelijke activiteiten van de OIV vinden plaats in deskundigengroepen, subcommissies en commissies, die worden gecoördineerd door een Wetenschappelijk en Technisch Comité, binnen het kader van een door de Algemene Vergadering goedgekeurd strategisch plan.   
4.  De Directeur-Generaal is verantwoordelijk voor de interne administratie van de OIV, en voor personeelsmanagement en -werving. De procedures voor personeelswerving moeten zoveel mogelijk het internationale karakter van de Organisatie veilig stellen.   
5.  De OIV kan eveneens waarnemers omvatten. Waarnemers worden eerst toegelaten nadat zij schriftelijk de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en van het hieruit voortvloeiende Reglement van orde hebben aanvaard.   
6.  De zetel van de Organisatie bevindt zich te Parijs (Frankrijk).   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####STEMRECHTEN

### Artikel  4  

Elk lid stelt het aantal van zijn afgevaardigden naar believe vast, maar heeft slechts twee basisstemmen plus, in voorkomend geval, een aantal aanvullende stemmen, berekend aan de hand van objectieve criteria die de relatieve positie van elke lidstaat in de druiven- en wijnsector bepalen onder de voorwaarden vervat in Bijlagen 1 en 2 van dit Verdrag, die een integraal deel van dit Verdrag vormen. Het totaal van deze twee getallen vormt het aantal gewogen stemmen. Het coëfficiënt voor de vaststelling van de positie van elke lidstaat binnen de druiven- en wijnsector wordt regelmatig geactualiseerd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage 1.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####WERKWIJZE EN BESLUITVORMINGSPROCEDURES

### Artikel  5  

1.  De Algemene Vergadering is het hoogste orgaan van de OIV. De Algemene Vergadering bespreekt en neemt voorschriften aan met betrekking tot de organisatie en het functioneren van de OIV, en ontwerpresoluties van algemene, wetenschappelijke, technische, economische en juridische aard, alsmede voor het instellen of ontbinden van commissies en subcommissies. Zij stelt de begroting van inkomsten en uitgaven vast binnen de grenzen van de bestaande kredieten, controleert de rekeningen en keurt deze goed. De Algemene Vergadering neemt Protocollen aan inzake samenwerking en medewerking op het gebied van wijnbouw- en hiervan afgeleide producten die de OIV met internationale organisaties kan sluiten. De Algemene Vergadering komt eenmaal per jaar bijeen. Op verzoek van een derde van de OIV-leden kunnen buitengewone vergaderingen bijeengeroepen worden.   
2.  Geldige besluiten kunnen slechts worden genomen indien afgevaardigden van een derde van de leden die ten minste de helft van de gewogen stemmen representeren daadwerkelijk aanwezig zijn. De vertegenwoordiging van een lid kan aan de delegatie van een ander lid worden toevertrouwd, maar een delegatie mag niet meer dan één lid anders dan het zijne vertegenwoordigen.   
3.  

a. Eenparigheid is de normale methode waarbij de Algemene Vergadering zowel ontwerpresoluties van algemene, wetenschappelijke, technische, economische of juridische aard aanneemt, alsook voor de instelling of ontbinding van commissies en subcommissies. Hetzelfde geldt voor het Uitvoerend Comité wanneer dit zijn taken op dit gebied uitoefent.  

b. Eenparigheid is niet vereist voor de verkiezingen van de Voorzitter van de OIV, de Voorzitters van commissies en subcommissies of van de Directeur-Generaal, en is ook niet van toepassing op de begroting of op de financiële bijdragen van de leden. Bovendien is het consensusvereiste niet van toepassing op andere in het Reglement van orde bepaalde financiële beslissingen.  

c. In de gevallen waarin de Algemene Vergadering of het Uitvoerend Comité in eerste instantie geen consensus bereiken over een ontwerpresolutie of -besluit, neemt de Voorzitter alle nodige initiatieven om overleg te plegen met de leden teneinde de standpunten op één lijn te krijgen in de periode voorafgaand aan de volgende vergadering van de Algemene Vergadering of het Uitvoerend Comité. Indien alle pogingen om een consensus te bereiken zijn mislukt, kan de Voorzitter overgaan tot stemming op basis van een gekwalificeerde meerderheid, zijnde de stem van twee derde plus één van de aanwezige of vertegenwoordigde leden, waarbij elk lid één stem heeft. Niettemin wordt de stemming voor een tijdvak van een jaar uitgesteld indien een lid van mening is dat zijn wezenlijke nationale belangen worden bedreigd. Indien dit standpunt vervolgens schriftelijk door de minister van Buitenlandse Zaken of elke andere bevoegde politieke autoriteit van het desbetreffende lid wordt bevestigd, wordt niet tot stemming overgegaan.     
4.  

a. De Voorzitter van de OIV, de Voorzitters van commissies en subcommissies en de Directeur-Generaal worden gekozen door middel van stemming bij een gewogen gekwalificeerde meerderheid, dat wil zeggen twee derde plus één van de gewogen stemmen van de aanwezige of vertegenwoordigde leden, mits de helft plus één van de aanwezige of vertegenwoordigde leden voor de kandidaat hebben gestemd. Indien aan deze voorwaarden niet wordt voldaan, wordt binnen een termijn van maximaal drie maanden een buitengewone vergadering van de Algemene Vergadering bijeengeroepen. De zittende Voorzitter en, afhankelijk van het geval, de Voorzitters van commissies en subcommissies en de Directeur-Generaal blijft c.q. blijven gedurende de tussenliggende periode in functie.  

b. De voorzitter van de OIV en de Voorzitters van de commissies en subcommissies worden gekozen voor een termijn van drie jaar. De Directeur-Generaal wordt gekozen voor een termijn van vijf jaar; hij is herkiesbaar voor een termijn van nog eens vijf jaar, onder dezelfde voorwaarden als die welke gelden voor zijn verkiezing. De Algemene Vergadering kan de Directeur-Generaal op elk tijdstip uit zijn functie ontzetten op basis van zowel de gewogen gekwalificeerde meerderheid als de voor zijn of haar verkiezing gehanteerde meerderheid van lidstaten.     
5.  Stemmingen met betrekking tot de begroting en financiële bijdragen van de leden vinden plaats op basis van de gewogen gekwalificeerde meerderheid, zijnde twee derde plus één van de gewogen stemmen van de aanwezige of vertegenwoordigde leden. Onder dezelfde voorwaarden benoemt de Algemene Vergadering een financiële controller, op gezamenlijke voordracht van de Directeur-Generaal en van het Bestuur van de OIV, met een positief advies van het Uitvoerend Comité.   
6.  De officiële talen zijn het Frans, het Spaans en het Engels. De financiering daarvan wordt vastgesteld in overeenstemming met Bijlage 2 bij dit Verdrag. De Algemene Vergadering kan deze financiering evenwel naar behoefte aanpassen onder de in artikel 5, derde lid, letter a, bedoelde voorwaarden. Op verzoek van een of meer leden worden andere talen toegevoegd overeenkomstig dezelfde wijze van financiering, met name het Italiaans en het Duits, teneinde de communicatie tussen de leden te verbeteren. De betrokken gebruikers moeten van tevoren officieel instemmen met de nieuwe financiële bijdragen die voortvloeien uit hun verzoek. Wanneer het aantal van vijf talen te boven wordt gegaan, wordt elk nieuw verzoek voorgelegd aan de Algemene Vergadering die haar besluit neemt onder de in artikel 5, derde lid, letter a, bedoelde voorwaarden. In geval van geschillen met derden die geen lid van de Organisatie zijn, is de Franse taal doorslaggevend.   
7.  De organen van de OIV functioneren op een open en transparante wijze.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####FINANCIERING VAN DE OIV

### Artikel  6  

1.  Elk lid van de OIV betaalt een financiële bijdrage die jaarlijks door de Algemene Vergadering wordt vastgesteld. Het bedrag van de bijdrage wordt vastgesteld aan de hand van de in Bijlage 1 en 2 bij dit Verdrag vervatte bepalingen. De Algemene Vergadering stelt de financiële bijdrage van nieuwe leden vast op basis van de bepalingen van Bijlage 1 en 2 van dit Verdrag.   
2.  De financiële middelen van de OIV omvatten de jaarlijkse verplichte bijdrage van elk van de leden en waarnemers, alsmede de inkomsten uit haar eigen activiteiten. De verplichte betalingen worden gedurende het desbetreffende kalenderjaar aan de OIV betaald. Hierna gedane betalingen worden aangemerkt als te late betalingen.   
3.  De financiële middelen van de OIV kunnen eveneens vrijwillige bijdragen van haar leden omvatten, alsmede schenkingen, giften, subsidies of betalingen van enigerlei aard door internationale en nationale organisaties van publieke, semi-publieke of private aard, mits dergelijke betalingen worden gedaan in overeenstemming met de richtlijnen die worden opgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering overeenkomstig artikel 5, derde lid, letter a, en die in het Reglement van orde worden opgenomen.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  Indien een lid verzuimt twee bijdragen te betalen, worden zijn stemrechten en recht op deelname aan de vergadering van het Uitvoerend Comité en de Algemene Vergadering volgend op de vaststelling van een dergelijk verzuim automatisch geschorst. Het Uitvoerend Comité stelt per geval vast onder welke voorwaarden het desbetreffende lid de situatie kan herstellen of, indien dit niet gebeurt, wordt geacht het Verdrag te hebben opgezegd.   
2.  In het geval dat drie opeenvolgende bijdragen niet zijn betaald, geeft de Directeur-Generaal het lid of de waarnemer in kwestie kennis van deze situatie. Indien de situatie niet is hersteld binnen twee jaar volgend op 31 december van het derde jaar, wordt het betrokken lid of de betrokken waarnemer automatisch uitgesloten.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####DEELNAME VAN INTERNATIONALE INTERGOUVERNEMENTELE ORGANISATIES

### Artikel  8  

Een internationale intergouvernementele organisatie kan deelnemen aan de werkzaamheden van de OIV of hiervan lid worden en bijdragen aan de financiering van de OIV onder voorwaarden die per geval door de Algemene Vergadering op voorstel van het Uitvoerend Comité worden vastgesteld.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####WIJZIGING EN HERZIENING VAN HET VERDRAG

### Artikel  9  

1.  Elk lid kan door middel van een schriftelijke mededeling aan de Directeur-Generaal wijzigingen van dit Verdrag voorstellen. De Directeur-Generaal deelt deze voorstellen mede aan alle leden van de Organisatie. Indien binnen zes maanden, te rekenen vanaf de datum van de mededeling, de helft plus een van de leden positief op het voorstel reageren, legt de Directeur-Generaal het tijdens de eerste Algemene Vergadering na afloop van dit tijdvak ter aanneming voor. De wijzigingen worden aangenomen met eenparigheid van stemmen van de aanwezige of vertegenwoordigde leden. Wanneer de wijzigingen eenmaal door de Algemene Vergadering zijn aangenomen, moeten zij worden onderworpen aan de in de nationale wetgeving van de leden vervatte procedures voor aanvaarding, goedkeuring of bekrachtiging. De wijzigingen worden van kracht 30 dagen na de nederlegging van de akte van aanvaarding, goedkeuring of bekrachtiging door twee derde plus een van de leden van de Organisatie.   
2.  Dit Verdrag wordt herzien indien twee derde plus een van de leden een verzoek daartoe goedkeuren. In een dergelijk geval roept de Regering van de Franse Republiek binnen zes maanden een Conferentie van de leden bijeen. Het programma alsmede het herzieningsvoorstel worden ten minste twee maanden voor de Vergadering van de Conferentie aan de leden verstrekt. De Conferentie stelt haar eigen procedureregels vast. De Directeur-Generaal van de OIV vervult de functie van Secretaris-Generaal.   
3.  Voordat een herzien verdrag in werking treedt, stelt de Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie, onder de voorwaarden vastgesteld in het onderhavige Verdrag en in het in artikel 10 bedoelde Reglement van orde, vast in hoeverre de staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en die geen akte van aanvaarding, goedkeuring, bekrachtiging of toetreding hebben nedergelegd, aan de activiteiten van de OIV kunnen deelnemen na de inwerkingtreding ervan.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####REGLEMENT VAN ORDE

### Artikel  10  

De Algemene Vergadering neemt het Reglement van orde van de OIV aan waarin, naar behoefte, de voorwaarden voor de uitvoering van dit Verdrag worden vastgelegd.

### Bijlage  1  

####bedoeld in de artikelen 4 en 6 van dit Verdrag

*Methode voor de vaststelling van de positie van elke lidstaat in de druiven- en wijnsector*   

### 1  

Objectieve criteria voor de vaststelling van de relatieve positie van elke lidstaat in de druiven- en wijnsector: 

a. gemiddelde productie van wijnen, speciale wijnen, most en spiritualiën op basis van druiven of wijn (uitgedrukt in wijnequivalenten) gedurende het laatste tijdvak van 5 jaren waarover statistieken beschikbaar zijn, na verwijdering van de twee extreme waarden (P);  

b. gemiddelde totale oppervlakte van de wijngaarden gedurende het laatste tijdvak van drie jaren waarover statistieken beschikbaar zijn (S);  

c. gemiddelde kennelijke consumptie van wijn en wijnequivalenten gedurende de laatste drie jaren waarover statistieken beschikbaar zijn (C) = (P) productie – E (exporten) + I (importen).    

### 2  

Formule voor de vaststelling van het coëfficiënt voor elke lidstaat:   ![10000025014](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000025014)

### 3  

Het coëfficiënt van elke lidstaat wordt geactualiseerd: 

a. aan het begin van het begrotingsjaar volgend op de toetreding van een nieuw lid;  

b. elke drie jaar aan de hand van de meest recente beschikbare statistieken.    

### 4  

Nieuwe leden: Nieuwe leden die zich in de toekomst bij de OIV aansluiten, moeten een verplichte financiële bijdrage leveren, berekend in overeenstemming met de in deze Bijlage gedefinieerde formule, vermeerderd met een bijdrage aan de specifieke financiering ten behoeve van talen, onder de in Bijlage 2 vastgestelde voorwaarden.  

### Bijlage  2  

####bedoeld in de artikelen 4, 5 en 6 van dit Verdrag

*Methode voor de vaststelling van de stemrechten en de verplichte financiële bijdrage van de Staten en de methode voor de financiering van talen*   

### 1  

Basisstemmen: Elke lidstaat heeft twee basisstemmen.  

### 2  

Aanvullende stemmen: Het totale aantal aanvullende stemmen is gelijk aan de helft van het totale aantal basisstemmen. Tot dit maximum worden, in voorkomend geval, in aanvulling op de basisstemmen aan bepaalde lidstaten aanvullende stemmen toegekend, afhankelijk van hun relatieve positie in de druiven- en wijnsector, overeenkomstig de in Bijlage 1 gedefinieerde formule.  

### 3  

Gewogen stemmen: Het aantal van de gewogen stemmen van elke Staat is gelijk aan de som van zijn basisstemmen en eventuele aanvullende stemmen.  

### 4  

Verdeling van de verplichte bijdragen: Het totale bedrag van de verplichte bijdragen die door de leden moeten worden betaald, wordt berekend op basis van de door de Algemene Vergadering aangenomen begroting. Een derde van het totale bedrag van de verplichte bijdragen wordt gelijkelijk over de basisstemmen verdeeld. Twee derde van het totale bedrag van de verplichte bijdragen wordt naar rato over de aanvullende stemmen verdeeld. Teneinde de overgang van de oude Overeenkomst naar dit Verdrag te vergemakkelijken kan de financiële bijdrage die overeenkomt met de twee basisstemmen van elke lidstaat voor het eerste begrotingsjaar niet minder bedragen dan het bedrag van de „contributie-eenheid" die van toepassing is voorafgaand aan de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag. Indien nodig wordt het bedrag van de financiële bijdragen voor aanvullende stemmen overeenkomstig aangepast om uit te komen op het totale bedrag van de ingevolge de aangenomen begroting vastgestelde verplichte bijdragen.  

### 5  

Financiering van talen: De financiering van talen wordt volledig gedekt door middel van de algemene middelen van de OIV en zonder specifieke bijdrage van de gebruikers van elke taalgroep samengesteld uit leden en waarnemers. De regeling voor het gebruik van talen wordt vastgesteld in bijzondere bepalingen in het Reglement van orde.
