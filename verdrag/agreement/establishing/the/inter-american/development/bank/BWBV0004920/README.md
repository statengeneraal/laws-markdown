Section 8.   *Optional Conditions for Making or Guaranteeing Loans*  

(a) In the case of loans or guarantees of loans to nongovernmental entities, the Bank may when it deems it advisable, require that the member in whose territory the project is to be carried out, or a public institution or a similar agency of the member acceptable to the Bank, guarantee the repayment of the principal and the payment of interest and other charges on the loan.  

(b) The Bank may attach such other conditions to the making of loans or guarantees as it deems appropriate, taking into account both the interests of the members directly involved in the particular loan or guarantee proposal and the interests of the members as a whole.     
Section 9.   *Use of Loans Made or Guaranteed by the Bank*  

(a) Except as provided in Article V, Section 1, the Bank shall impose no condition that the proceeds of a loan shall be spent in the territory of any particular country nor that such proceeds shall not be spent in the territories of any particular member or members; provided, however, that with respect to any increase of the resources of the Bank the question of restriction of procurement by the Bank or any member with regard to those members which do not participate in an increase under the terms and conditions specified by the Board of Governors may be determined by the Board of Governors.  

(b) The Bank shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed, or participated in by the Bank are used only for the purposes for which the loan was granted, with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency.     
Section 10.   *Payment Provisions for Direct Loans*  Direct loan contracts made by the Bank in conformity with Section 4 of this article shall establish: 

(a) All the terms and conditions of each loan, including among others, provision for payment of principal, interest and other charges, maturities, and dates of payment; and  

(b) The currency or currencies in which payments shall be made to the Bank.     
Section 11.   *Guarantees*  

(a) In guaranteeing a loan the Bank shall charge a guarantee fee, at a rate determined by the Bank, payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding.  

(b) Guarantee contracts concluded by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed.  

(c) In issuing guarantees, the Bank shall have power to determine any other terms and conditions.

The special commission, payable periodically, shall be computed on the amount outstanding on each loan, participation, or guarantee and shall be at the rate of one per cent per annum, unless the Bank, by a two-thirds majority of the total voting power of the member countries, decides to reduce the rate of commission.   
Section 13.   *Special Reserve*  The amount of commissions received by the Bank under Section 12 of this article shall be set aside as a special reserve, which shall be kept for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Article VII, Section 3 (b) (i). The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted under this Agreement, as the Board of Executive Directors may decide.

Before the Board of Governors determines to make a transfer to the Fund, it shall have received a report from the Board of Executive Directors on the desirability of such a transfer, which shall take into consideration, *inter alia,* (1) whether the reserves have reached a level that is adequate; (2) whether the transferred funds are needed for the operation of the Fund; and (3) the impact, if any, on the Bank's ability to borrow.  

(c) The distributions referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made from the ordinary capital resources in proportion to the number of ordinary capital shares held by each member and from the inter-regional capital resources in proportion to the number of inter-regional capital shares held by each member and likewise the net profits transferred to the Fund pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be credited to the total contribution quotas of each member in the Fund in the foregoing proportions.

(d) If the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph has not been consummated within six months after the country ceases to be a member or such other time as the Bank and such country may agree upon, the repurchase price of such country's capital stock shall be its book value, according to the books of the Bank, on the date when the country ceased to be a member. Such repurchase shall be subject to the following conditions: 

(i) As a prerequisite for payment, the country ceasing to be a member shall surrender its stock certificates, and such payment may be made in such installments, at such times and in such available currencies as the Bank determines, taking into account the financial position of the Bank.  

(ii) Any amount which the Bank owes the country for the repurchase of its capital stock shall be withheld to the extent that the country or any of its subdivisions or agencies remains liable to the Bank as a result of loan or guarantee operations. The amount withheld may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. However, no amount shall be withheld on account of the country's contingent liability for future calls on its subscription pursuant to Article II, Section 4 (a) (ii), or Article IIA, Section 3 (c).  

(iii) If the Bank sustains net losses on any loans or participations, or as a result of any guarantees, outstanding on the date the country ceased to be a member, and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserves provided therefor on such date, such country shall repay on demand the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced, if the losses had been taken into account when the book value of the shares, according to the books of the Bank, was determined. In addition, the former member shall remain liable on any call pursuant to Article II, Section 4 (a) (ii), or Article IIA, Section 3 (c), to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares had been determined.    

(e) In no event shall any amount due to a country for its shares under this section be paid until six months after the date upon which the country ceases to be a member. If within that period the Bank terminates operations all rights of such country shall be determined by the provisions of Article X, and such country shall be considered still a member of the Bank for the purposes of such article except that it shall have no voting rights.     

### Article  X

No member shall be entitled to receive its share in such a distribution of assets until it has settled all of its obligations to the Bank.

####Principles for the admission of nonregional members into the Inter-American Development Bank

### 1  

Nonregional countries may become “Nonregional Members” of the Bank.  

### 2  

After the admission of nonregional members, the pattern of voting strength among the members of the Bank shall be such that the present members will retain a total of not less than 92% of total voting power, with not less than 53.5% for Latin America, not less than 34.5% for the United States, and not less than 4% for Canada. There would therefore remain available for the nonregional members as a group, a total voting power within the Bank not exceeding 8%.  

### 3  

For this exercise to become effective, at least eight nonregional countries must have subscribed an amount of not less than US$750 million, of which not less than US$500 million shall be payable in cash. Of the total amount, not less than 50% would be in the form of concessionary funds and the remainder would consist of conventional resources. Such contributions may be made over a three-year period, with payments to be made in the currencies of the respective contributing countries. <sup> 1)  The amounts specified in this paragraph are expressed in U.S. dollars at their value after the February 1973 devaluation i.e., at 0.828948 Special Drawing Rights per dollar.  </sup>  

### 4  

Of the conventional resources to be contributed to the Bank by nonregional members, it is proposed that not less than 16.48 % be paid-in capital and the remainder, callable capital. It is contemplated that a new series or shares of capital stock could be used, in addition to the existing ordinary capital shares, in such amounts as may be necessary to reconcile the amounts of the contributions indicated in paragraph 3 with the distribution of voting power indicated in paragraph 2, and to assure that the callable capital subscription of nonregional members may be employed as backing for borrowings of the Bank in capital markets.  

### 5  

Of the concessional resources, the entire amount shall be contributed to the Fund for Special Operations. It is anticipated that the Bank would authorize its borrowers to make procurement on an untied basis among the Bank's members, regional and nonregional, with those resources of the Fund for Special Operations committed on loans authorized after the effective date of this exercise. With respect to a nonregional country admitted to membership in the Bank subsequent to that date, the authorization would apply to loans approved after the date of its admission to the Bank. The present procurement policy of the Bank would be accordingly revised at the appropriate time.  

### 6  

Each nonregional member will be entitled to one Governor and one Alternate Governor. However, appropriate measures will be taken so that the present rights of regional members with respect to the selection of the President of the Bank, the suspension of a regional member, or the approval of increases in resources, as well as their rights with respect to a quorum, shall not be adversely affected.  

### 7  

Nonregional members would be entitled to two Executive Directors and their respective Alternates. Each Executive Director will be elected by at least three countries and will cast, as a unit, the votes of the nonregional members he represents with respect to all matters coming before the Board of Executive Directors.  

### Resolution  AG-10/76  

####General Rules governing admission of nonregional countries to membership in the Bank

Whereas Article II, Section 1 (b), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank provides that nonregional countries which are members of the International Monetary Fund, and Switzerland, may be admitted as members to the Bank under such general rules as the Board of Governors shall have established; Whereas certain nonregional countries have expressed their interest in becoming members of the Bank; and Whereas the Board of Governors has concluded that it would be desirable to admit such nonregional countries as members of the Bank and that their admission should be accomplished through (i) the amendment of the Agreement Establishing the Bank to provide, among other matters, for the creation of a new category of capital which shall be denominated inter-regional capital stock of the Bank; (ii) the adoption of general rules governing the admission of nonregional member countries, including provisions for an increase in the resources of the Fund for Special Operations; and (iii) an increase in the authorized ordinary capital stock of the Bank, The Board of Governors Resolves that: The attached General Rules Governing Admission of Nonregional Countries to Membership in the Bank be approved.   

####General Rules governing admission of nonregional countries to membership in the Bank

###Section 1. *Conditions for Nonregional Membership*

Nonregional countries which are members of the International Monetary Fund, and Switzerland, may become members of the Bank provided that, on such date in the calendar year 1976 as the Board of Executive Directors shall determine, the following conditions shall have been fulfilled: 

(a) The amendments to the Agreement Establishing the Bank provided for in the resolution entitled “Amendments to the Agreement Establishing the Bank with respect to the Creation of the inter-regional Capital Stock of the Bank and to Related Matters” shall have entered into force;  

(b) The increase in the authorized ordinary capital stock provided for in the resolution entitled “Increase in the Authorized Callable Ordinary Capital Stock and Subscriptions Thereto in Connection with the Admission of Nonregional Member Countries” shall have come into effect;  

(c) At least eight nonregional countries, including not less than four countries with contributions to the Fund for Special Operations of not less than US$60,000,000 each, through the deposit of appropriate instruments with the Bank, shall have agreed:

Subscriptions to the inter-regional capital stock and contributions to the Fund for Special Operations by the nonregional countries shall be at least in the following amounts:

###Section 2. *Subscriptions to Inter-regional Capital Stock*

(a) Nonregional countries listed in Section 1 hereof may subscribe to shares of inter-regional capital stock.  

(b) Each subscription shall include at least the full amount of both paid-in inter-regional capital shares and callable inter-regional capital shares assigned to the respective country in Section 1 hereof, and each subscribing country shall represent to the Bank that it has taken all necessary action to authorize its subscription and shall furnish to the Bank such information thereon as the latter may request.  

(c) The subscription of each country to the paid-in inter-regional capital stock shall be on the following terms and conditions: 

(i) The subscription price per share shall be US$10,000 in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1959.  

(ii) Payment of the amount of paid-in inter-regional capital stock subscribed by each country shall be made in three equal installments, except that the Board of Executive Directors, taking into account special circumstances with respect to particular countries, may agree (i) that the amount of the first installment to be paid by the respective country may be decreased to not less than 20% of the amount of the paid-in capital assigned to such country, with the two subsequent installments to be adjusted accordingly; or (ii) that payment by the respective country may be made in five equal annual installments. The first installment shall be paid by each country within thirty days after the entry into force of these General Rules or on or before the date of deposit of the instrument of acceptance or ratification in accordance with Section 4 (c) (ii) hereof, whichever shall be later. If a country chooses to pay the first installment in cash, it may make the payment not later than the end of the calendar year in which these General Rules enter into force or the calendar year in which the member deposits its instrument of ratification, if this is later. Each of the remaining annual installments shall become due at intervals of one year after the date on which the first installment becomes due.  

(iii) Each installment shall be paid entirely in the currency of the contributing country which shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to assure that such currency shall be freely convertible into the currencies of other countries for the purposes of the Bank's operations.  

(iv) 50% of each installment shall be subject to the provisions of Article V, Section 1 (b) (i), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank and shall be paid in cash. With respect to the remaining 50% of each installment, unless a country elects to make payment thereof also in cash, the Board of Executive Directors shall establish a schedule pursuant to which any non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing promissory notes or similar securities accepted pursuant to Article V, Section 4, shall be paid to the Bank.    

(d) The subscription of each country to the callable inter-regional capital stock shall be on the following terms and conditions: 

(i) The subscription price per share shall be US$10,000 in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1959.  

(ii) The subscription of each country to the callable inter-regional capital stock shall be in three equal installments, which shall be subscribed, respectively, on or before the corresponding dates for payment of each of the first three installments of the country's subscription to the paid-in inter-regional capital stock pursuant to Section 2 (c) (ii) hereof.    

(e) The inter-regional capital resources shall be utilized in making loans in such a manner as to ensure a reasonable distribution of such loans and subsequent obligations between ordinary and inter-regional capital resources.  

(f) At such time as the Bank shall have discharged its liabilities on all its ordinary capital borrowings which were outstanding at December 31, 1974, measures shall be taken to merge the inter-regional capital stock and the ordinary capital stock.   
###Section 3. *Increase in the Fund for Special Operations and Contributions Thereto*

(a) Subject to the provisions of these General Rules, the resources of the Fund for Special Operations shall be increased by the equivalent of US$506,664,161, through contributions by nonregional countries, it being understood from their approval of these General Rules that the regional member countries do not wish to avail themselves of their right to contribute to a proportional share of such increase pursuant to Article IV, Section 3 (g), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank.  

(b) Such increase shall become effective and such contributions shall become payable only upon these General Rules entering into force pursuant to Section 10 hereof.  

(c) Nonregional countries shall make contributions to the Fund for Special Operations equivalent to their subscriptions to nonregional capital stock pursuant to Section 1 (c) hereof.  

(d) Each country shall make its contribution entirely in its own currency and shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to assure that such currency shall be freely convertible into the currencies of other countries for the purposes of the Bank's operations.  

(e) The entire amount of each contribution shall constitute national currency to which the provisions of Article V, Section 1 (c), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, shall be applicable. Should a country elect not to make payment of its entire contribution or any part thereof in cash, the Bank, pursuant to Article V, Section 4, of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, shall accept non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing promissory notes or similar securities for which the Board of Executive Directors shall establish a schedule of encashment.  

(f) The contributions shall be made in three equal installments, except that the Board of Executive Directors, taking into account special circumstances with respect to particular countries, may agree (i) that the amount of the first installment to be paid by the respective country may be decreased to not less than 20 % of the amount of the total contribution assigned to such country, with the two subsequent installments to be adjusted accordingly; or (ii) that payment by the respective country may be made in five equal annual installments. The installments shall be paid on the same dates as the payments by the country of its installments of paid-in inter-regional capital stock pursuant to Section 2 hereof.  

(g) Each payment of a country shall be in such an amount as, in the opinion of the Bank, is equivalent to the full value, in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect upon the October 18, 1973 change in the par value of the United States dollar.  

(h) Currencies of all the members held by the Bank which are derived from these contributions shall be subject to the maintenance of value provisions of Article V, Section 3, of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, but the standard of value set for this purpose shall be the United States dollar of the weight and fineness in effect upon the October 18, 1973 change in the par value of the United States dollar, provided, however, that the Bank may waive this readjustment in the event of a currency realignment involving a significant number of members of the Bank.  

(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article IV, Section 3 (g), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, and in keeping with the traditional method for augmenting the resources of the Fund for Special Operations, any future increases in the resources of the Fund for Special Operations shall be in such proportions and on such terms and conditions as shall be negotiated at that time.

(iii) It has represented to the Bank that it has taken all action necessary to sign the Agreement and deposit the instrument of acceptance or ratification as contemplated by paragraphs (i) and (ii) above and it shall have furnished to the Bank such information in respect of such action as the Bank may have requested.     
###Section 5. *Additional Nonregional Countries*

Additional nonregional countries not listed in Section 1 hereof may become members of the Bank in accordance with such terms as the Board of Governors shall establish. The subscriptions of such additional nonregional countries and their respective contributions to the Fund for Special Operations shall be such number of shares of paid-in and callable inter-regional capital stock and such contributions to the Fund for Special Operations as shall be determined by the Board of Governors with due regard to the conditions of the subscriptions and contributions of the nonregional countries listed in Section 1 hereof. 
###Section 6. *Unsubscribed Stock and Contribution Quotas*

Inter-regional capital stock and contribution quotas to the Fund for Special Operations provided for by Section 1 (c) of these General Rules which have not been subscribed by the nonregional countries listed in Section 1 hereof or by additional nonregional countries as provided in Section 5 hereof within two years from the date on which these General Rules shall have entered into force may then be subscribed by the nonregional member countries which are members at that time. Each such member shall have the right to subscribe to a proportion of the available stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock already subscribed bears to the total subscribed inter-regional capital stock. Likewise, each such member shall have the right to subscribe to a proportion of the unsubscribed quotas to the Fund for Special Operations equivalent to the proportion which its contribution quota bears to the total subscribed quota contributions. In each subscription there shall be maintained the ratio of paid-in to callable capital as well as the ratio of contributions to the Fund for Special Operations to subscriptions to capital stock established in these General Rules. Payment for the paid-in capital and the contribution quotas to the Fund for Special Operations, as well as the subscriptions to the callable capital so subscribed, shall be accomplished within three years from the date on which these General Rules enter into force. 
###Section 7. *Special Quorum and Voting Power*

(a) The agreement of a two-thirds majority of the total number of governors of nonregional members representing not less than three fourths of the total voting power of the nonregional member countries shall be required for the approval of: 

(i) any amendment of the Agreement Establishing the Bank modifyng: (1) the number of governors who shall be appointed by the nonregional member countries; (2) the number of executive directors who shall be elected by the governors of the nonregional member countries as provided in Article VIII, Section 3 (b) (ii), of the Agreement; (3) Article VII, Section 3 (d), (e) and (f), of the Agreement; or (4) the provisions relating to the distribution of the net profits and surplus of the inter-regional capital resources as provided in Article VII, Section 4, of the Agreement; and  

(ii) any increase in the authorized inter-regional capital stock as provided in Article IIA, Section 1 (c), of the Agreement.    

(b) No increase in the subscription of any member to either the ordinary capital stock or the inter-regional capital stock shall become effective, and any right to subscribe thereto is hereby waived, which would have the effect of reducing the voting power (i) of the regional developing members below 53.5 per cent of the total voting power of the member countries; (ii) of the member having the largest number of shares below 34.5 per cent of such total voting power; or (iii) of Canada below 4 per cent of such total voting power, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and the provisions of Article VIII, Section 4 (b), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, any resolution of the Board of Governors for an increase in the ordinary capital stock or the inter-regional capital stock of the Bank shall specify that (1) in order to prevent the voting power of the regional developing members as a group from falling below the set percentage, any member of the group may subscribe to shares allocated to another member of the group if the latter member does not wish to subscribe to such shares; (2) the provision relating to percentages of voting power may be waived by the regional developing members as a group with respect to (i), and by the United States and Canada with respect to (ii) and (iii), respectively; and (3) any member of the group of nonregional members may subscribe to shares allocated to another member of the group if the latter member does not wish to subscribe to such shares.   
###Section 8. *Amendment of the Regulations for Election of Executive Directors*

Since nonregional countries shall have the right to elect two executive directors with their own votes as provided in Article VIII, Section 3 (b) (ii), of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, as amended by the resolution referred to in Section 1 (a) hereof, the Regulations for Election of Executive Directors, provided for in said Article of the Agreement, are amended to read as set forth in Annex I hereto. These amendments shall become effective on the same date as these General Rules enter into force. 
###Section 9. *Number of Executive Directors*

The agreement of a two-thirds majority of the total number of governors of nonregional members shall be required for the approval of an increase in the number of executive directors of the Bank beyond a total number of thirteen executive directors. 
###Section 10. *Entry into Force*

Aandelen met een tegenwaarde van vierhonderd miljoen dollar ($400.000.000) zullen volgestorte aandelen zijn, en aandelen ter waarde van vierhonderdvijftig miljoen dollar ($450.000.000) zullen niet-volgestorte aandelen zijn voor de doeleinden aangegeven in sectie 4 (a) (ii) van dit artikel.  

(c) Het onder letter (a) van dit lid bedoelde gewone kapitaal wordt verhoogd met vijfhonderd miljoen dollar ($500.000.000) uitgedrukt in VS dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959, met dien verstande dat:

(ii) de Raad van Bestuur, tijdens een zo spoedig mogelijk na de onder (i) van deze sectie bedoelde datum gehouden gewone of bijzondere vergadering, zijn goedkeuring heeft gehecht aan bovenvermelde verhoging van vijfhonderd miljoen dollar ($ 500.000.000) met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen.    

(d) De onder de voorgaande letter bedoelde kapitaalverhoging geschiedt in de vorm van niet-volgestort kapitaal.  

(e) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder de letters (c) en (d) van deze sectie en behoudens het bepaalde in artikel VIII, sectie 4 (b), kan het gewoon maatschappelijk kapitaal worden verhoogd wanneer de Raad van Bestuur zulks wenselijk acht en op een wijze die is overeengekomen met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders van regionale leden.  

(f) Wanneer het interregionaal maatschappelijk aandelenkapitaal wordt verhoogd ingevolge artikel IIA, sectie 1 (c), en een lid maakt gebruik van de in artikel II, sectie 3 (f), voorziene keuzemogelijkheid, dan wordt het gewone aandelenkapitaal verhoogd met het bedrag dat nodig is om een zodanig lid in staat te stellen gebruik te maken van die keuzemogelijkheid en het voor inschrijving door dat lid beschikbare interregionale aandelenkapitaal wordt verminderd met een gelijk bedrag en wordt dienovereenkomstig geannuleerd.     
Sectie 3.   *Inschrijving op aandelen*  

(a) Ieder regionaal lid schrijft in op aandelen van het gewone kapitaal en niet-regionale leden kunnen daarop inschrijven overeenkomstig de onder letter (b) van dit lid gestelde voorwaarden alsmede op de voorwaarden die de Raad van Bestuur vaststelt. Het aantal aandelen waarop door de oorspronkelijke leden dient te worden ingeschreven, is vermeld in Bijlage A bij deze Overeenkomst waarin de verplichting van ieder lid ten aanzien van zowel het volgestorte als het niet-volgestorte kapitaal wordt omschreven. Het aantal aandelen waarop andere leden dienen in te schrijven, wordt door de Bank vastgesteld.  

(b) In geval van een verhoging van het gewone kapitaal ingevolge sectie 2, onder de letters (c) of (e) van dit artikel of van een verhoging van het interregionale kapitaal ingevolge artikel IIA, sectie 1 (c) of van een verhoging van zowel het gewone als het interregionale kapitaal, heeft ieder lid het recht, op de voorwaarden die de Bank bepaalt, in te schrijven voor een evenredig deel van het bedrag waarmee het kapitaal wordt verhoogd gelijkstaand met de verhouding waarin de aandelen waarvoor het reeds heeft ingeschreven staan tot het totale geplaatste kapitaal van de Bank. Geen lid zal echter verplicht zijn in te schrijven op een gedeelte van een zodanig verhoogd kapitaal.  

(c) De aandelen van het gewone aandelenkapitaal waarvoor de oorspronkelijke leden aanvankelijk hebben ingeschreven, worden uitgegeven a pari. Andere aandelen worden eveneens a pari uitgegeven tenzij de Bank onder bijzondere omstandigheden besluit ze op andere voorwaarden uit te geven.  

(d) De aansprakelijkheid van de lid-landen uit hoofde van hun aandelenbezit van het gewone kapitaal is beperkt tot het niet-betaalde gedeelte van de prijs van uitgifte.  

(e) De aandelen van het gewone kapitaal worden op generlei wijze verpand of bezwaard en zijn slechts aan de Bank overdraagbaar.  

(f) Ieder lid dat het recht heeft in te schrijven op het interregionale aandelenkapitaal van de Bank krachtens het bepaalde onder letter (b) van deze sectie, heeft de mogelijkheid dat recht terzijde te stellen en in plaats daarvan in te schrijven op een gelijk bedrag van het gewone aandelenkapitaal.     
Sectie 4.   *Betaling der inschrijvingen*  

(a) Betaling der inschrijvingen op het gewone kapitaal van de Bank ls vermeld in Bijlage A geschiedt als volgt: 

(i) Het door ieder land op het volgestorte kapitaal van de Bank ingeschreven bedrag wordt betaald in drie termijnen, waarbij de eerste betaling 20 procent van dat bedrag uitmaakt, en de tweede en derde elk 40 procent. De eerste termijn wordt door ieder land betaald op enig tijdstip op of na de datum waarop deze Overeenkomst namens dat land overeenkomstig artikel XV, sectie 1 is ondertekend en de akte van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging is nedergelegd, doch niet later dan 30 september 1960. De resterende twee termijnen worden betaald op de data die de Bank bepaalt, maar niet eerder dan onderscheidenlijk 30 september 1961 en 30 september 1962. Van iedere termijnbetaling wordt 50 procent betaald in goud en/of dollars en 50 procent in de valuta van het betrokken lid.  

(ii) Het niet-volgestorte deel van de inschrijving op gewone kapitaalaandelen van de Bank kan slechts worden gevorderd wanneer de Bank dit nodig heeft om te voldoen aan haar verplichtingen aangegaan krachtens artikel III, sectie 4 (ii) en (v), uit hoofde van het lenen van fondsen voor toevoeging aan de gewone kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank of van ten laste van die middelen komende garanties. In geval van een zodanige vordering kan de betaling naar keuze van het lid geschieden in goud, in VS dollars, of in de valuta die nodig is om te voldoen aan de verplichtingen van de Bank die aanleiding zijn tot het verzoek tot storting. Verzoeken tot storting op niet-betaalde inschrijvingen dienen een gelijk percentage van alle aandelen te betreffen.    

(b) Elke betaling door een lid in diens eigen valuta gedaan ingevolge het bepaalde onder letter (a) (i) van deze sectie beloopt het bedrag dat de Bank acht gelijkwaardig te zijn aan de volledige waarde van het gedeelte van de inschrijving dat wordt betaald, uitgedrukt in VS dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959. De aanvankelijke betaling beloopt het bedrag dat het lid op grond van deze bepalingen juist acht, doch wordt aangepast op de wijze die de Bank nodig oordeelt ten einde de volledige tegenwaarde in dollars zoals bedoeld in dit lid te vormen, en wel binnen 60 dagen na de datum waarop de betaling was verschuldigd.  

(c) Tenzij anders bepaald door de Raad van Bestuur met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, is de verplichting van leden tot betaling van de tweede en de derde termijn van het volgestorte deel van hun inschrijvingen op het aandelenkapitaal afhankelijk van de betaling van ten minste 90 procent van de totale verplichtingen van de leden verschuldigd voor: 

(i) respectievelijk de eerste en de tweede termijn van het volgestorte deel van de inschrijvingen; en  

(ii) de aanvankelijke betaling en alle voorgaande verzoeken tot betaling van de inschrijvingsquota's op het Fonds.

(iii) alle fondsen ontvangen als terugbetaling van leningen die zijn verstrekt met de onder (i) en (ii) van deze sectie aangeduide middelen;

Sectie 3.   *Betaling der inschrijvingen op interregionaal kapitaal*  

(a) Betaling van het door ieder lid op het volgestort interregionaal kapitaal ingeschreven bedrag geschiedt volledig in de valuta van het onderscheiden lid dat ten genoegen van de Bank maatregelen treft ten einde te verzekeren dat, behoudens de bepalingen van artikel V, sectie 1 (c), zijn valuta vrij inwisselbaar is in de valuta's van andere landen, zulks ten behoeve van de werkzaamheden van de Bank.

(b) Door gelden ter beschikking te stellen ten einde uitgaven te dekken die in verband staan met de doeleinden van de lening op het grondgebied van het lid waarop het project moet worden uitgevoerd. Slechts in bijzondere gevallen, met name wanneer het project indirect aanleiding is tot een vergroting van de vraag naar deviezen in dat land, wordt de door de Bank gegeven financiering tot dekking van lokale uitgaven verschaft in goud of in andere valuta's dan die van een zodanig lid; in die gevallen mag het bedrag van de door de Bank voor deze financiering ter beschikking gestelde fondsen niet hoger zijn dan een redelijk gedeelte van de door de leningnemer gemaakte lokale kosten.     
Sectie 7.   *Regels en voorwaarden voor het verstrekken of garanderen van leningen*  

(a) De Bank kan leningen verstrekken of garanderen met inachtneming van de volgende regels en voorwaarden: 

(i) de aanvrager van de lening heeft een uitgewerkt voorstel ingediend en de stafleden van de Bank hebben een schriftelijk verslag voorgelegd waarin het voorstel, na bestudering van de kwaliteiten ervan, wordt aanbevolen. In bijzondere omstandigheden kan de Raad van Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen verlangen dat een voorstel ter beslissing wordt voorgelegd aan de Raad zonder zodanig rapport;  

(ii) bij het beoordelen van een aanvraag voor een lening of een garantie overweegt de Bank de mogelijkheid voor de leningnemer de lening te verkrijgen uit particuliere fondsen op voorwaarden die de Bank voor de leningnemer redelijk acht, daarbij rekening houdende met alle in het geding zijnde factoren;  

(iii) bij het verstrekken of garanderen van een lening overweegt de Bank terdege de kansen dat de leningnemer en degene die zich eventueel voor hem garant stelt, bij machte zullen zijn hun verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit de overeenkomst van lening na te komen;  

(iv) naar het oordeel van de Bank zijn de rentevoet, de andere kosten en het terugbetalingsschema van de hoofdsom in overeenstemming met het desbetreffende project;  

(v) bij het garanderen van een lening die is verstrekt door andere investeerders, ontvangt de Bank een passende vergoeding voor het risico dat zij loopt; en  

(vi) door de Bank verstrekte of gegarandeerde leningen zijn voornamelijk voor het financieren van specifieke projecten, met inbegrip van die welke deel uitmaken van een nationaal of regionaal ontwikkelingsprogramma. De Bank kan echter algemene leningen verstrekken of garanderen aan ontwikkelingsinstellingen of soortgelijke organen van de leden zodat deze laatsten de financiering van specifieke ontwikkelingsprojecten kunnen vergemakkelijken waarvan de individuele financieringsbehoeften naar het oordeel van de Bank niet groot genoeg zijn om rechtstreeks toezicht door de Bank te rechtvaardigen.    

(b) De Bank financiert geen ondernemingen op het grondgebied van een lid indien dat lid tegen die financiering bezwaar maakt.     
Sectie 8.   *Facultatieve voorwaarden voor het verstrekken of garanderen van leningen*  

(a) In geval van leningen of garanties van leningen aan niet-gouvernementele lichamen kan de Bank, indien zij zulks raadzaam oordeelt, eisen dat het lid op welks grondgebied het project moet worden uitgevoerd, of een openbare instelling of een soortgelijke instantie van het lid die aanvaardbaar is voor de Bank, de terugbetaling garandeert van de hoofdsom en de betaling van rente en andere kosten op de lening.  

(b) De Bank kan zodanige andere voorwaarden aan het verstrekken of garanderen van leningen verbinden die zij passend acht, daarbij zowel de belangen van de rechtstreeks bij het desbetreffende voorstel voor een lening of garantie betrokken leden in aanmerking nemend als de belangen van de leden gezamenlijk.     
Sectie 9.   *Gebruik van door de Bank verstrekte of gegarandeerde leningen*  

(a) Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel V, sectie 1, stelt de Bank niet de voorwaarde dat de opbrengst van een lening moet worden besteed op het grondgebied van een bepaald land noch dat die opbrengst niet mag worden besteed op het grondgebied van een bepaald lid of bepaalde leden; met dien verstande echter dat met betrekking tot een verhoging van de middelen van de Bank, de Raad van Bestuur kan beslissen over de kwestie van beperking van de besteding door de Bank of een lid ten aanzien van die leden die niet deelnemen in een verhoging op de door de Raad van Bestuur gestelde voorwaarden.  

(b) De Bank neemt de nodige maatregelen om te verzekeren dat de opbrengst van een lening die is verstrekt of gegarandeerd door de Bank of waarin door de Bank wordt deelgenomen, alleen wordt gebruikt voor de doeleinden waarvoor de lening werd verstrekt, met de nodige aandacht voor overwegingen van zuinigheid en doelmatigheid.     
Sectie 10.   *Regelingen voor de betaling van rechtstreekse leningen*  In contracten van door de Bank in overeenstemming met sectie 4 van dit artikel verstrekte rechtstreekse leningen worden vastgesteld: 

(a) Alle voorwaarden voor iedere lening, met inbegrip van onder meer regelingen voor de betaling van de hoofdsom, de rentevoet en andere kosten, de vervaldata en de betaaldata; en  

(b) De valuta of valuta's waarin betalingen aan de Bank dienen te worden gedaan.     
Sectie 11.   *Garanties*  

(a) Bij het garanderen van een lening berekent de Bank een periodiek over het uitstaande bedrag van de lening te betalen garantievergoeding waarvan de hoogte door de Bank wordt vastgesteld.  

(b) Door de Bank gesloten garantiecontracten houden in dat de Bank haar aansprakelijkheid met betrekking tot rente kan beëindigen indien, bij in gebreke blijven van de leningnemer en de eventuele garant, de Bank aanbiedt de gegarandeerde obligaties of andere schuldverplichtingen te kopen, a pari, vermeerderd met de bijkomende interest, tot een in het aanbod genoemde datum.  

(c) Bij het geven van garanties heeft de Bank de bevoegdheid andere voorwaarden en bedingen vast te stellen.     
Sectie 12.   *Bijzondere provisie*  De Bank berekent een bijzondere provisie op alle leningen die zij verstrekt, waarin zij deelneemt, of die zij garandeert met of ten laste van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank. Deze periodiek betaalbare bijzondere provisie wordt berekend over het bedrag dat uitstaat op elke lening, deelneming, of garantie en wel op basis van een procent per jaar, tenzij de Bank met een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen besluit het provisiepercentage te verminderen.   
Sectie 13.   *Bijzondere reserve*  Het bedrag van de door de Bank krachtens sectie 12 van dit artikel ontvangen provisies wordt op een bijzondere reserverekening geboekt, die beschikbaar wordt gehouden om verplichtingen van de Bank overeenkomstig artikel VII, sectie 3 (b) (i) na te komen. De Raad van Bewindvoerders kan bepalen in welke liquide vorm, toegestaan krachtens deze Overeenkomst, de bijzondere reserve zal worden aangehouden.

(ii) De resterende 50 procent wordt betaald op enig tijdstip nadat een jaar is verlopen sinds de aanvang der werkzaamheden van de Bank, in de bedragen en op de tijdstippen die de Bank bepaalt; met dien verstande echter dat het totale bedrag van alle quota's niet later dient te worden betaald dan de datum die is vastgesteld voor de betaling van de derde termijn van de inschrijvingen op het volgestorte kapitaal van de Bank.  

(iii) De krachtens dit lid vereiste betalingen worden verdeeld onder de leden naar verhouding van hun quota's en worden voor de helft in goud en/of VS dollars voldaan en voor de andere helft in de valuta van het bijdragende lid.    

(e) Elke betaling door een lid in diens eigen valuta ingevolge de vorige sectie beloopt het bedrag dat de Bank acht gelijkwaardig te zijn aan de volledige waarde van het gedeelte van de quota dat wordt betaald, uitgedrukt in VS dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959. De oorspronkelijke betaling beloopt het bedrag dat het lid op grond van deze bepalingen juist acht, doch wordt aangepast op de wijze die de Bank nodig oordeelt ten einde de volledige tegenwaarde zoals bedoeld in deze sectie te vormen, en wel binnen zestig dagen na de datum waarop de betaling was verschuldigd.  

(f) Tenzij anders bepaald door de Raad van Bestuur met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, is de verplichting van leden tot betaling van een vordering op het niet-betaalde deel van hun inschrijvingsquota's op het Fonds afhankelijk van de betaling van ten minste 90 procent van de totale verplichtingen van de leden voor: 

(i) de oorspronkelijke betaling en alle voorgaande verzoeken tot storting op zodanige inschrijvingsquota's op het Fonds; en  

(ii) alle termijnbetalingen die zijn verschuldigd over het volgestorte deel van de inschrijvingen op het kapitaal van de Bank.    

(g) De middelen van het Fonds worden verhoogd door middel van aanvullende bijdragen door de leden, wanneer de Raad van Bestuur zulks raadzaam acht met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totale aantal stemmen van de lid-landen. De bepalingen van artikel II, sectie 3 (b) zijn van toepassing op zodanige verhogingen wat betreft de verhouding tussen de voor ieder lid geldende quota en het totale bedrag van de door leden bijgedragen middelen van het Fonds. De leden zijn echter niet verplicht enig deel van een zodanige verhoging bij te dragen.  

(h) In deze Overeenkomst wordt onder de term „de middelen van het Fonds” verstaan: 

(i) bijdragen van leden ingevolge het bepaalde onder de letters (c) en (g) van deze sectie;  

(ii) alle fondsen verkregen uit leningen waarop de in artikel II, sectie 4 (a) (ii) en artikel IIA, sectie 3 (c) bepaalde verplichtingen niet van toepassing zijn, dat wil zeggen de fondsen die met name ten laste van de middelen van het Fonds komen;  

(iii) alle fondsen ontvangen als terugbetaling van leningen die zijn verstrekt met de hierboven vermelde middelen;  

(iv) alle inkomsten afkomstig van werkzaamheden waarvoor enige van de hierboven vermelde middelen werden gebruikt of belast; en  

(v) alle andere ter beschikking van het Fonds staande middelen.       
Sectie 4.   *Werkzaamheden*

Het niet in de valuta van het lid terug te betalen deel van de lening wordt betaald in de valuta of valuta's waarin de lening werd verstrekt.     
Sectie 5.   *Beperking ten aanzien van aansprakelijkheid*  Bij de werkzaamheden van het Fonds wordt de financiële aansprakelijkheid van de Bank beperkt tot de middelen en reserves van het Fonds en de aansprakelijkheid van leden wordt beperkt tot het niet-betaalde deel van hun onderscheiden quota's dat verschuldigd is geworden en dient te worden betaald.   
Sectie 6.   *Beperking ten aanzien van beschikking over quota's*  De rechten van leden van de Bank die voortvloeien uit hun bijdragen aan het Fonds kunnen niet worden overgedragen of belast, en leden hebben geen recht op teruggave van die bijdragen behalve in geval van verlies van het lidmaatschap of bij beëindiging van de werkzaamheden van het Fonds.   
Sectie 7.   *Nakoming van verplichtingen van het Fonds ten aanzien van leningen*  Betalingen ter voldoening van een verplichting ten aanzien van leningen van fondsen ter opneming in de middelen van het Fonds worden ten laste gebracht van: 

(i) ten eerste een voor dit doel ingestelde reserve; en  

(ii) ten tweede andere fondsen die beschikbaar zijn in de middelen van het Fonds.     
Sectie 8.   *Beheer*  

(a) Behoudens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst hebben de autoriteiten van de Bank volledige bevoegdheid het Fonds te beheren.  

(b) Een Vice-President van de Bank voert het beheer over het Fonds. De Vice-President neemt zonder stemrecht deel aan de vergaderingen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders van de Bank, wanneer zaken die verband houden met het Fonds worden besproken.  

(c) Ten behoeve van de werkzaamheden van het Fonds maakt de Bank zoveel mogelijk gebruik van dezelfde personeelsleden, deskundigen, installaties, kantoren, uitrusting en diensten die zij voor haar andere werkzaamheden gebruikt.  

(d) De Bank publiceert een afzonderlijk jaarverslag over de resultaten van de financiële werkzaamheden van het Fonds met inbegrip van winsten of verliezen. Bij de jaarvergadering van de Raad van Bestuur wordt ten minste één zitting gewijd aan de bespreking van dit verslag. Bovendien doet de Bank haar leden een kwartaalverslag van de werkzaamheden van het Fonds toekomen.     
Sectie 9.   *Stemrecht*  

(a) Bij het nemen van beslissingen ten aanzien van de werkzaamheden van het Fonds heeft ieder lid-land van de Bank het aantal stemmen in de Raad van Bestuur dat hem ingevolge artikel VIII, sectie 4 (a) en (c) is toegekend, en iedere Bewindvoerder heeft het aantal stemmen in de Raad van Bewindvoerders dat hem ingevolge artikel VIII, sectie 4 (a) en (d) is toegekend.  

(b) Alle besluiten van de Bank ten aanzien van de werkzaamheden van het Fonds worden genomen met een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, tenzij in dit artikel anders bepaald.     
Sectie 10.   *Verdeling van netto-winsten*  De Raad van Bestuur van de Bank bepaalt welk deel van de netto-winsten van het Fonds, na voorziening van de reserves, wordt uitgekeerd aan de leden. Zodanige netto-winsten worden verdeeld naar verhouding van de quota's van de leden.   
Sectie 11.   *Intrekking van bijdragen*  

(a) Geen enkel land kan zijn bijdrage intrekken en zijn betrekkingen met het Fonds beëindigen zolang het nog lid is van de Bank.  

(b) De bepalingen van artikel IX, sectie 3 ten aanzien van de vereffening van rekeningen met landen die hun lidmaatschap van de Bank beëindigen, zijn ook van toepassing op het Fonds.     
Sectie 12.   *Opschorting en beëindiging*  De bepalingen van artikel X zijn ook van toepassing op het Fonds, waarbij de verwijzingen naar de Bank, haar kapitaalmiddelen en onderscheiden krediteuren worden vervangen door die welke betrekking hebben op het Fonds en zijn middelen en onderscheiden krediteuren.   

### Artikel  V  

####VALUTA'S

Sectie 1.   *Gebruik van valuta's*  

(a) De valuta van een lid die de Bank onder haar berusting heeft in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, in haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen of in de middelen van het Fonds, op welke wijze ook verkregen, kan door de Bank en door een gemachtigde van de Bank, zonder een door het lid opgelegde beperking, worden gebruikt voor betaling van op het grondgebied van een zodanig lid vervaardigde goederen en verleende diensten.  

(b) Leden mogen geen beperkingen handhaven of opleggen aan het gebruiken door de Bank of door een gemachtigde van de Bank voor betalingen in enig land van: 

(i) door de Bank ontvangen goud en dollars als betaling van de 50 procent van de inschrijving van ieder lid op aandelen van het gewone kapitaal van de Bank en van de 50 procent van de quota van ieder lid als bijdrage aan het Fonds, ingevolge de bepalingen van onderscheidenlijk artikel II en artikel IV en door de Bank ontvangen valuta's als betaling van het daarmee overeenkomende deel van de inschrijving van ieder lid op aandelen van het interregionaal kapitaal ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel IIA;  

(ii) valuta's van leden die met de middelen vermeld onder (i) van deze sectie zijn gekocht;  

(iii) valuta's verkregen uit leningen die zijn aangegaan ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel VII, sectie 1 (i), ter opneming in de kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank;  

(iv) goud en dollars die de Bank heeft ontvangen als betaling van de hoofdsom, de rente en andere kosten, van leningen die zijn verstrekt uit de goud- en dollarfondsen, vermeld onder (i) van letter (b); valuta's die de Bank heeft ontvangen als betaling van de hoofdsom, de rente en andere kosten van leningen die zijn verstrekt uit het onder (i) van letter (b) bedoelde deel van het interregionale kapitaal; valuta's ontvangen als betaling van de hoofdsom, de rente en andere kosten van leningen die zijn verstrekt met onder (ii) en (iii) van letter (b) vermelde valuta's; en valuta's ontvangen als betaling van provisies en vergoedingen verband houdende met alle door de Bank gegeven garanties; en  

(v) valuta's, met uitzondering van die van het lid zelf, die het lid heeft ontvangen van de Bank ingevolge artikel VII, sectie 4 (d), en artikel IV, sectie 10 bij de verdeling van de netto-winsten.    

(c) De valuta van een lid die de Bank, in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, in haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen, of in de middelen van het Fonds onder haar berusting heeft en die niet valt onder letter (b) van deze sectie, kan door de Bank of een gemachtigde van de Bank tevens worden gebruikt voor betalingen in enig land zonder enige beperking, tenzij het lid de Bank in kennis stelt van zijn wens het gebruik van die valuta of van een deel daarvan te beperken tot de onder letter (a) van deze sectie vermelde doeleinden.  

(d) Leden mogen geen beperkingen opleggen aan het houden en gebruiken door de Bank ter aflossing of voor het doen van vervroegde betalingen of voor het geheel of ten dele terugkopen van de eigen schuldverplichtingen van de Bank, van valuta's die de Bank heeft ontvangen als terugbetaling van rechtstreekse leningen die zijn verstrekt uit in de gewone of interregionale kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank opgenomen geleende fondsen.  

(e) Goud of valuta's die de Bank in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, in haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen of in de middelen van het Fonds onder haar berusting heeft, worden niet door de Bank gebruikt om andere valuta's te kopen tenzij zij hiertoe wordt gemachtigd met een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen. Ingevolge de bepalingen onder deze letter gekochte valuta's zijn niet onderworpen aan de handhaving van de waarde krachtens sectie 3 van dit artikel.     
Sectie 2.   *Waardebepaling van valuta's*  Wanneer het krachtens deze Overeenkomst nodig is de waarde van een valuta uit te drukken in een andere valuta of in goud, wordt die waardebepaling door de Bank na overleg met het Internationale Monetaire Fonds vastgesteld.   
Sectie 3.   *Handhaving van de waarde van de valutabezittingen van de Bank*  

(a) Steeds wanneer de pari-waarde in het Internationale Monetaire Fonds van de valuta van een lid wordt verminderd of de wisselkoers van de valuta van een lid, naar het oordeel van de Bank, in aanmerkelijke mate is gedeprecieerd, betaalt het lid binnen een redelijke termijn een aanvullend bedrag van zijn eigen valuta aan de Bank, dat voldoende is om de waarde te handhaven van het totale bedrag aan valuta van dat lid dat de Bank onder haar berusting heeft in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, in haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen of in de middelen van het Fonds, met uitzondering van de valuta die de Bank heeft verkregen uit leningen. Voor dit doel is de waardenorm de VS dollar van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959.  

(b) Steeds wanneer de pari-waarde in het Internationale Monetaire Fonds van de valuta van een lid wordt verhoogd of de buitenlandse waarde van de valuta van een lid, naar het oordeel van de Bank, aanmerkelijk in waarde is gestegen, betaalt de Bank aan die sectie binnen een redelijke termijn een bedrag van de valuta van dat lid terug dat gelijk is aan de stijging van de waarde van het bedrag van die valuta dat de Bank onder haar berusting heeft in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, in haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen of in de middelen van het Fonds, met uitzondering van de valuta die de Bank heeft verkregen uit leningen. Voor dit doel is de waardenorm dezelfde als die welke onder letter (a) is vastgesteld.  

(c) De Bank kan de bepalingen van dit lid terzijde stellen, wanneer een uniforme proportionele wijziging in de pari-waarde van de valuta's van al haar leden wordt aangebracht door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds.  

(d) Onverminderd alle andere bepalingen van deze sectie kunnen de voorwaarden van een verhoging van de middelen van het Fonds ingevolge artikel 4, sectie 3 (g), andere bepalingen voor handhaving van de waarde dan in deze sectie omvatten, welke van toepassing zouden zijn op de door een zodanige verhoging bijgedragen middelen van het Fonds.     
Sectie 4.   *Methoden ter bewaring van valuta's*  De Bank aanvaardt van een lid promessen of soortgelijke waardepapieren, uitgegeven door de regering van het lid of door de door dat lid aangewezen depositaris, ter vervanging van enig deel van de valuta van het lid dat de 50 procent uitmaakt van zijn inschrijving op het gewoon maatschappelijk kapitaal van de Bank en de 50 procent van zijn inschrijving op de middelen van het Fonds, welke ingevolge de bepalingen van onderscheidenlijk artikel II en artikel IV, door ieder lid moeten worden betaald in zijn nationale valuta, mits die valuta niet benodigd is door de Bank voor het uitvoeren van haar werkzaamheden. Dergelijke promessen of waardepapieren zijn niet-verhandelbaar, niet-rentedragend en op verzoek betaalbaar aan de Bank tegen hun pari-waarde. Op dezelfde voorwaarden aanvaardt de Bank ook zodanige promessen als waardepapieren ter vervanging van enig deel van de inschrijving van een lid op het interregionale kapitaal ten aanzien van welk deel de voorwaarden van de inschrijving geen betaling in gereed geld vereisen.   

### Artikel  VI  

####TECHNISCHE BIJSTAND

Sectie 1.   *Verlening van technische adviezen en bijstand*  De Bank kan op verzoek van een lid of van leden of van particuliere ondernemingen die leningen bij haar kunnen aangaan, technische adviezen en bijstand verlenen op het terrein van haar werkzaamheden, in het bijzonder inzake: 

(i) de voorbereiding, financiering en uitvoering van ontwikkelingsplannen en -projecten, met inbegrip van het afwegen van prioriteiten, en het formuleren van leningsvoorstellen betreffende specifieke nationale of regionale ontwikkelingsprojecten; en  

(ii) de ontwikkeling en voortgezette opleiding, door middel van studiebijeenkomsten en andere vormen van onderricht, van personeel dat zich in het bijzonder bekwaamt in het formuleren en uitvoeren van ontwikkelingsplannen en -projecten.     
Sectie 2.   *Samenwerkingsovereenkomsten inzake technische bijstand*  Ten einde de doeleinden van dit artikel te verwezenlijken, kan de Bank overeenkomsten inzake technische bijstand sluiten met andere nationale of internationale overheidsinstellingen dan wel particuliere instellingen.   
Sectie 3.   *Kosten*  

(a) De Bank kan met technische bijstand ontvangende lid-landen of firma's regelingen treffen voor vergoeding van de kosten die voortvloeien uit het verlenen van zodanige bijstand en wel op voorwaarden die de Bank passend acht.  

(b) De uit het verlenen van technische bijstand voortvloeiende kosten die niet worden betaald door de ontvangers, worden gedekt uit het netto-inkomen van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen, de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen, of het Fonds. Gedurende de eerste drie jaar van de werkzaamheden van de Bank kan echter een bedrag van in totaal maximaal 3 procent van de oorspronkelijke middelen van het Fonds worden gebruikt om zodanige kosten te dekken.     

### Artikel  VII  

####DIVERSE BEVOEGDHEDEN EN VERDELING VAN WINSTEN

Sectie 1.   *Diverse bevoegdheden van de Bank*  Naast de elders in deze Overeenkomst omschreven bevoegdheden, is de Bank bevoegd: 

(i) fondsen te lenen en in verband hiermee zodanig zakelijk of ander onderpand te verschaffen als de Bank bepaalt, met dien verstande dat de Bank, alvorens zij haar schuldbrieven op de markt van een land verkoopt, hiervoor toestemming heeft gekregen van dat land en van het lid in wiens valuta de verplichtingen worden aangeduid. In geval van leningen van fondsen voor opneming in de gewone kapitaalmiddelen of de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank, dient de Bank bovendien van zodanige landen toestemming te krijgen voor het zonder enige beperking omwisselen van de opbrengst in de valuta van een ander land;  

(ii) waardepapieren die de Bank heeft uitgegeven of gegarandeerd of waarin zij haar middelen heeft belegd, te kopen en te verkopen, met dien verstande dat de Bank daartoe toestemming krijgt van het land op welks grondgebied de waardepapieren zullen worden gekocht of verkocht;  

(iii) met de goedkeuring van een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, fondsen die niet benodigd zijn voor haar werkzaamheden te beleggen in door haar zelf te bepalen schuldbrieven;  

(iv) waardepapieren waarin zij heeft belegd, te garanderen ten einde de verkoop daarvan te vergemakkelijken; en  

(v) alle andere bevoegdheden uit te oefenen die nodig of wenselijk zijn voor de bevordering van haar doel en taken overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.     
Sectie 2.   *Waarschuwing die dient te worden geplaatst op de waardepapieren*  Ieder waardepapier dat door de Bank is uitgegeven of gegarandeerd, draagt op de voorzijde duidelijk zichtbaar een verklaring, inhoudende dat het geen schuldverplichting van enige regering is, tenzij dit wel het geval is, in welk geval het dient te worden vermeld.   
Sectie 3.   *Wijzen waarop de Bank haar verplichtingen nakomt in geval van in gebreke blijven*  

(a) In geval van feitelijk of dreigend in gebreke blijven ten aanzien van leningen die de Bank heeft verstrekt of gegarandeerd met haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen of haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen, neemt de Bank de haar daartoe als aangewezen voorkomende maatregelen met betrekking tot wijziging van de voorwaarden van de lening, met uitzondering van de valuta waarin terugbetaling moet plaatsvinden.  

(b) Betalingen ter nakoming van de verplichtingen van de Bank ten aanzien van leningen of garanties krachtens artikel III, sectie 4 (ii) en (v), ten laste komende van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank, worden ten laste gebracht van: 

(i) ten eerste de bijzondere reserve, ingesteld bij artikel III, sectie 13; en  

(ii) vervolgens voor zover nodig en naar goeddunken van de Bank, de andere reserves, de winst en de fondsen overeenkomend met het kapitaal dat is gestort voor de gewone kapitaalaandelen.    

(c) Steeds wanneer dit nodig is om de contractuele betalingen van rente, andere lasten of aflossing op de door de Bank uit haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen te betalen leningen te voldoen of haar verplichtingen na te komen met betrekking tot overeenkomstige betalingen ten aanzien van leningen die door de Bank zijn gegarandeerd en die ten laste komen van haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, kan de Bank in overeenstemming met artikel II, sectie 4 (a) (ii), van de leden betaling vorderen van een dienovereenkomstig deel van hun inschrijvingen op het niet-volgestorte gewone kapitaal. Bovendien kan de Bank, indien zij van mening is dat betaling lange tijd kan uitblijven, betaling vorderen van een aanvullend deel van die inschrijvingen dat echter in een bepaald jaar niet meer dan één procent van het totaal der inschrijvingen van de leden op de gewone kapitaalmiddelen mag bedragen, ten einde 

(i) vóór de vervaldag over te gaan tot aflossing, of de verplichtingen van de Bank op andere wijze na te komen ten aanzien van het geheel of een gedeelte van de uitstaande hoofdsom van enige door haar gegarandeerde lening die ten laste komt van haar gewone kapitaalddelen, ten opzichte waarvan de schuldenaar in gebreke is; en  

(ii) haar schuldverplichting af te kopen of op andere wijze na te komen, voor het geheel of een gedeelte van haar eigen uitstaande schuldverplichtingen die betaald dienen te worden uit haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen.    

(d) De verplichtingen van de Bank ten aanzien van alle leningen van fondsen ter opneming in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen die op 31 december 1974 uitstonden, dienen te worden betaald uit zowel de gewone kapitaalmiddelen als de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen, met inbegrip van, onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel IIA, sectie 3(c), de inschrijvingen op het niet-volgestort interregionaal kapitaal, met dien verstande echter dat de Bank al het mogelijke doet om haar verplichtingen ten aanzien van zodanige uitstaande leningen na te komen uit haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen ingevolge het bepaalde onder de letters (b) en (c) van deze sectie alvorens zodanige verplichtingen na te komen uit haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen ingevolge het bepaalde onder de letters (e) en (f) van deze sectie, voor welk doel onder die letters de term gewoon kapitaal op passende wijze wordt vervangen door interregionaal kapitaal  

(e) Betalingen ter nakoming van de verplichtingen van de Bank ten aanzien van leningen of garanties krachtens artikel III, sectie 4 (iv) en (v), ten laste komende van de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank, worden ten laste gebracht van: 

(i) ten eerste een voor dit doel ingestelde reserve; en  

(ii) vervolgens, voor zover nodig en naar goeddunken van de Bank, de andere reserves, de winst en de fondsen overeenkomend met het kapitaal dat is gestort voor interregionale kapitaalaandelen.    

(f) Steeds wanneer dit nodig is om de contractuele betalingen van rente, andere lasten of aflossing op de door de Bank opgenomen leningen die betaald dienen te worden uit haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen te voldoen of haar verplichtingen na te komen met betrekking tot overeenkomstige betalingen ten aanzien van leningen die door de Bank zijn gegarandeerd en die ten laste komen van haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen, kan de Bank in overeenstemming met artikel IIA, sectie 3(c), van de leden betaling vorderen van een dienovereenkomstig bedrag van hun inschrijvingen op het niet-volgestorte interregionale kapitaal. Bovendien kan de Bank, indien zij van mening is dat betaling lange tijd kan uitblijven, betaling vorderen van een extra deel van die inschrijvingen, dat echter in een bepaald jaar niet meer dan een procent van het totaal der inschrijvingen van de leden op de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen mag bedragen, ten einde: 

(i) vóór de vervaldag over te gaan tot aflossing, of de verplichting van de Bank op andere wijze na te komen ten aanzien van het geheel of een gedeelte van de uitstaande hoofdsom van enige door haar gegarandeerde lening die ten laste komt van haar interregionale taalmiddelen, ten opzichte waarvan de schuldenaar in gebreke is; en  

(ii) haar schuldverplichting af te kopen of op andere wijze na te komen voor het geheel of een gedeelte van haar eigen uitstaande schuldverplichtingen die betaald dienen te worden uit haar interregionale kapitaalmiddelen.       
Sectie 4.   *Verdeling of overdracht van netto-winsten en surplus*  

(a) De Raad van Bestuur kan periodiek bepalen welk deel van de netto-winsten en van het surplus van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen en van de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen wordt uitgekeerd. Zodanige uitkeringen kunnen slechts plaatsvinden wanneer de reserves naar het oordeel van de Raad van Bestuur een voldoende niveau hebben bereikt.  

(b) Na goedkeuring van de winst- en verliesrekeningen ingevolge artikel VIII, sectie 2(b) (viii), kan de Raad van Bestuur bij besluit van een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal bestuurders die ten minste drie vierde van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen vertegenwoordigen, een deel van de netto-winsten over het desbetreffende boekjaar van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen of van de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen overdragen aan het Fonds. Alvorens de Raad van Bestuur besluit over te gaan tot een zodanige overdracht aan het Fonds, dient hij een rapport te hebben ontvangen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders inzake de wenselijkheid van een zodanige overdracht waarbij onder andere wordt overwogen (1) of de reserves een niveau hebben bereikt dat voldoende is; (2) of de overgedragen fondsen benodigd zijn voor de werkzaamheden van het Fonds; en (3) de eventuele invloed op de mogelijkheden voor de Bank om leningen aan te gaan.  

(c) De onder letter (a) van deze sectie bedoelde uitkeringen worden gedaan uit de gewone kapitaalmiddelen naar verhouding van het aantal gewone kapitaalaandelen dat ieder lid in zijn bezit heeft en uit de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen naar verhouding van het aantal interregionale kapitaal aandelen dat ieder lid in zijn bezit heeft en evenzo worden de ingevolge het bepaalde onder letter (b) van deze sectie aan het Fonds overgedragen netto-winsten toegevoegd aan de totale bijdragenquota's van ieder lid in het Fonds in de hiervoor vermelde verhoudingen.  

(d) Betalingen ingevolge het bepaalde onder letter (a) van deze sectie worden gedaan op de wijze en in de valuta of valuta's die de Raad van Bestuur bepaalt. Indien zodanige betalingen aan een lid worden gedaan in andere valuta's dan zijn eigen valuta, mag geen enkel lid beperkingen opleggen aan de overdracht van zodanige valuta's en het gebruik ervan door het ontvangende land.

(d) De Raad van Bestuur houdt als regel een jaarvergadering. Andere vergaderingen kunnen worden gehouden wanneer de Raad van Bestuur zulks nodig acht of wanneer deze door de Raad van Bewindvoerders worden bijeengeroepen. Vergaderingen van de Raad van Bestuur worden eveneens door de Raad van Bewindvoerders bijeengeroepen, wanneer daarom door vijf leden van de Bank of door leden die een vierde van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen hebben, wordt verzocht.  

(e) Een quorum voor iedere vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur wordt gevormd door een absolute meerderheid van het totaal aantal bestuurders, met inbegrip van een absolute meerderheid van de bestuurders van regionale leden die ten minste twee derde van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen vertegenwoordigen.  

(f) De Raad van Bestuur kan een procedure vaststellen waarbij de Raad van Bewindvoerders wanneer hij zulks passend acht, een bepaalde kwestie ter stemming aan de bestuurders kan voorleggen zonder een vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur bijeen te roepen.  

(g) De Raad van Bestuur en voor zover hij daartoe is gemachtigd, de Raad van Bewindvoerders, kunnen de regels en voorschriften goedkeuren die nodig of dienstig kunnen zijn voor de uitoefening door de Bank van haar werkzaamheden.  

(h) Bestuurders en plaatsvervangers bekleden hun functies zonder beloning van de Bank, doch de Bank mag hun een redelijke vergoeding geven voor de kosten gemaakt in verband met het bijwonen der vergaderingen van de Raad van Bestuur.     
Sectie 3.   *Raad van Bewindvoerders*  

(a) De Raad van Bewindvoerders is verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering van de werkzaamheden van de Bank en mag daartoe alle bevoegdheden uitoefenen die door de Raad van Bestuur aan hem zijn overgedragen.

(i) Bewindvoerders dienen personen te zijn die een erkende bekwaamheid en ruime ervaring bezitten in economische en financiële zaken, maar mogen niet tevens bestuurders zijn.  

(ii) Eén Bewindvoerder wordt benoemd door het lid-land die het grootste aantal aandelen in de Bank bezit, twee Bewindvoerders worden gekozen door de bestuurders der niet-regionale lid-landen, en ten minste acht anderen worden gekozen door de bestuurders van de resterende lid-landen. Het aantal in de laatste categorie te verkiezen Bewindvoerders en de verkiezingsprocedure voor alle verkiesbare Bewindvoerders wordt bepaald in regels die zijn vastgesteld door de Raad van Bestuur met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen, ten aanzien van de bepalingen die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de verkiezing van Bewindvoerders door niet-regionale lid-landen, een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders der niet-regionale leden, en, ten aanzien van de bepalingen die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op het aantal en de verkiezing van Bewindvoerders door de resterende lid-landen, met een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders der regionale leden. Voor de goedkeuring van enige wijziging in de bovenvermelde regels is dezelfde meerderheid van stemmen vereist.  

(iii) Bewindvoerders worden benoemd of gekozen voor ambtsperioden van drie jaar en kunnen voor opeenvolgende ambtsperioden worden herbenoemd of herkozen.    

(c) Iedere Bewindvoerder wijst een plaatsvervanger aan met volledige bevoegdheid voor hem op te treden, wanneer hij niet aanwezig is. De Bewindvoerders en hun plaatsvervangers dienen onderdanen van de lid-landen te zijn. Geen van de gekozen Bewindvoerders en hun plaatsvervangers mag dezelfde nationaliteit hebben, met uitzondering van landen die geen leningnemers zijn. Plaatsvervangers mogen deelnemen aan vergaderingen, doch mogen alleen hun stem uitbrengen wanneer zij optreden in de plaats van hun principalen.  

(d) Bewindvoerders blijven hun functie uitoefenen totdat hun opvolgers zijn benoemd of gekozen. Indien de functie van een gekozen Bewindvoerder meer dan 180 dagen voor het einde van zijn ambtsperiode openvalt, wordt door de bestuurders die de vorige Bewindvoerder hebben gekozen een opvolger gekozen voor het resterende deel van de ambtsperiode. Voor deze verkiezing is een absolute meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen nodig. Zolang de functie onvervuld blijft, oefent de plaatsvervanger alle bevoegdheden van de vorige bewindvoerder uit, behalve de bevoegdheid een plaatsvervanger aan te wijzen.  

(e) De Raad van Bewindvoerders oefent bij voortduring op het hoofdkantoor van de Bank zijn functie uit en vergadert zo vaak als de werkzaamheden van de Bank dit vereisen.  

(f) Een quorum voor iedere vergadering van de Raad van Bewindvoerders wordt gevormd door een absolute meerderheid van het totaal aantal Bewindvoerders waaronder begrepen een absolute meerderheid van de Bewindvoerders der regionale leden, die ten minste twee derde van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen vertegenwoordigen.  

(g) Een lid van de Bank kan een vertegenwoordiger zenden naar iedere vergadering van de Raad van Bewindvoerders wanneer wordt beraadslaagd over een vraagstuk waarbij dat lid ten nauwste is betrokken. De Raad van Bestuur stelt regels vast voor dit recht van vertegenwoordiging.  

(h) De Raad van Bewindvoerders kan de commissies benoemen die hij raadzaam acht. Het lidmaatschap van die commissies behoeft niet te worden beperkt tot bestuurders, Bewindvoerders of plaatsvervangers.  

(i) De Raad van Bewindvoerders stelt de hoofdlijnen voor de organisatie van de Bank vast, waaronder begrepen het aantal en de algemene verantwoordelijkheden van de belangrijkste administratieve en door deskundigen te bekleden functies der stafleden en keurt de begroting van de Bank goed.     
Sectie 4.   *Stemrecht*  

(a) Ieder lid-land heeft 135 stemmen plus één stem voor ieder aandeel van het gewone kapitaal en voor ieder aandeel van het interregionale kapitaal van de Bank dat dat land in zijn bezit heeft, met dien verstande echter dat in verband met enige verhoging van het gewoon of het interregionaal maatschappelijk kapitaal, de Raad van Bestuur kan bepalen dat het zodanig verhoogde aandelenkapitaal geen stemrechten inhoudt en niet onderworpen is aan de in artikel II, sectie 3(b) vastgelegde voorkeursrechten.  

(b) Een verhoging van de inschrijving van een lid op hetzij het gewone kapitaal hetzij het interregionale kapitaal wordt niet van kracht en het recht om daarop in te schrijven wordt hierbij ter zijde gesteld, wanneer deze verhoging een vermindering tot gevolg zou hebben van het aantal stemmen (i) van de regionale ontwïkkelingsleden tot minder dan 53,5 procent van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen; (ii) van het lid dat het grootste aantal aandelen bezit tot minder dan 34,5 procent van een zodanig totaal aantal stemmen; of (iii) van Canada tot minder dan 4 procent van een zodanig totaal aantal stemmen.  

(c) Bij stemming in de Raad van Bestuur is iedere bestuurder gerechtigd de stemmen uit te brengen van het lid-land dat hij vertegenwoordigt. Voor zover in deze Overeenkomst niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, worden alle besluiten van de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen genomen.  

(d) Bij stemming in de Raad van Bewindvoerders: 

(i) is de benoemde Bewindvoerder gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen van het lid-land dat hem benoemde;  

(ii) is iedere gekozen Bewindvoerder gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat hij bij zijn verkiezing op zich heeft verenigd, welke stemmen als een eenheid worden uitgebracht; en  

(iii) voor zover in deze Overeenkomst niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, worden alle besluiten van de Raad van Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen genomen.       
Sectie 5.   *President, Uitvoerend Vice-President en stafleden*  

(a) De Raad van Bestuur kiest met een meerderheid van het totaal antal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een absolute meerderheid van de bestuurders der regionale leden, een President van de Bank die, tijdens het bekleden van zijn functie, geen bestuurder noch Bewindvoerder noch plaatsvervanger van een van beiden mag zijn. Volgens de aanwijzingen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders leidt de President van de Bank de lopende zaken van de Bank en hij is het hoofd van de staf. Tevens is hij voorzitter bij vergaderingen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders maar heeft, behoudens een beslissende stem in geval van staking der stemmen, geen stemrecht. De President van de Bank is de vertegenwoordiger van de Bank in rechten. De ambtstermijn van de President van de Bank is vijf jaar en hij kan worden herkozen voor opeenvolgende ambtstermijnen. Hij treedt af wanneer de Raad van Bestuur zulks beslist met een meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de regionale lid-landen.  

(b) De Uitvoerend Vice-President wordt benoemd door de Raad van Bewindvoerders op aanbeveling van de President van de Bank. Volgens de aanwijzingen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders en de President van de Bank oefent de Uitvoerend Vice-President de bevoegdheid en de taken bij het besturen van de Bank uit die zijn bepaald door de Raad van Bewindvoerders. Bij afwezigheid of onvermogen van de President van de Bank oefent de Uitvoerend Vice-President de bevoegdheden van de President uit en vervult hij diens taak. De Uitvoerend Vice-President neemt deel aan de vergaderingen van de Raad van Bewindvoerders maar heeft op die vergaderingen geen stemrecht, zij het dan dat hij, zoals bepaald onder letter (a) van deze sectie, een beslissende stem uitbrengt wanneer hij optreedt in de plaats van de President van de Bank.  

(c) Naast de in artikel IV, sectie 8(b) bedoelde Vice-President, kan de Raad van Bewindvoerders op aanbeveling van de President van de Bank andere Vice-Presidenten benoemen die de bevoegdheden uitoefenen en de functies vervullen die de Raad van Bewindvoerders kan bepalen.  

(d) De President, het leidinggevend personeel en het andere personeel van de Bank staan bij het uitoefenen van hun functies geheel in dienst van de Bank en erkennen geen enkele andere autoriteit. Ieder lid van de Bank eerbiedigt het internationale karakter van deze dienstbetrekking.  

(e) De belangrijkste overweging bij de tewerkstelling van het personeel en bij de vaststelling van de arbeidsvoorwaarden is de noodzaak een zo hoog mogelijk peil van doelmatigheid, bekwaamheid en integriteit te waarborgen. Tevens dient de nodige aandacht te worden geschonken aan het belang van het aantrekken van personeel op een zo breed mogelijke geografische basis, waarbij het regionale karakter van de Bank in aanmerking dient te worden genomen.  

(f) De Bank, haar leidinggevend personeel en ander personeel dienen zich niet in de politieke aangelegenheden van een lid te mengen, noch zich bij hun beslissingen door het politieke karakter van het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden te laten beïnvloeden. Bij het nemen van hun beslissingen mogen zij zich uitsluitend door economische overwegingen laten leiden en deze overwegingen worden onpartijdig tegen elkaar afgewogen ten einde het doel en de taken zoals omschreven in artikel I te verwezenlijken.     
Sectie 6.   *Openbaarmaking van verslagen en verschaffing van informatie*  

(a) De Bank publiceert een jaarverslag, bevattende een afzonderlijke door accountants gecertificeerde balans en winst- en verliesrekening van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen en van de interregionale kapitaalmiddelen. Zij doet haar leden voorts ieder kwartaal beknopte overzichten van de financiële positie toekomen, alsmede opgaven van winst en verlies waarin de resultaten van haar gewone werkzaamheden en die van haar werkzaamheden met betrekking tot de interregionale middelen afzonderlijk worden vermeld.  

(b) De Bank kan ook andere verslagen publiceren die zij voor de vervulling van haar doel en functies wenselijk acht.     

### Artikel  IX  

####OPZEGGING EN SCHORSING VAN LEDEN

Sectie 1.   *Recht van opzegging*  Ieder lid kan uit de Bank treden door middel van een aan het hoofdkantoor van de Bank gerichte schriftelijke kennisgeving van zijn voornemen daartoe. Een zodanige uittreding gaat definitief in op de in de kennisgeving vermelde datum, doch in geen geval eerder dan zes maanden na het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving door de Bank is ontvangen. Het lid kan evenwel, zolang de opzegging niet definitief van kracht is geworden, de Bank, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, ervan verwittigen dat het zijn voorgenomen opzegging intrekt. Na uittreding blijft het lid verantwoordelijk voor alle directe en voorwaardelijke verplichtingen tegenover de Bank, waaraan het was gebonden op het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving van opzegging werd ontvangen, met inbegrip van die welke zijn vermeld in sectie 3 van dit artikel. Indien de opzegging echter definitief van kracht wordt, is het lid niet verantwoordelijk voor verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit werkzaamheden van de Bank die zijn verricht na het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving van opzegging door de Bank werd ontvangen.   
Sectie 2.   *Schorsing van leden*  Indien een lid zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Bank niet nakomt, kan de Bank hem als lid schorsen bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een twee derde meerderheid van het totaal aantal bestuurders welke in geval van schorsing van een regionaal lid-land een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders van regionale leden dient te omvatten en in geval van schorsing van een niet-regionaal lid-land een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders van niet-regionale leden. Een op deze wijze geschorst lid houdt een jaar na de datum van zijn schorsing automatisch op lid te zijn van de Bank, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur met dezelfde meerderheid besluit de schorsing te beëindigen. Zolang de schorsing duurt, is een lid niet bevoegd enig recht ingevolge deze Overeenkomst uit te oefenen, behalve het recht van opzegging, doch het blijft gebonden aan al zijn verplichtingen.   
Sectie 3.   *Vereffening van rekeningen*  

(a) Na het tijdstip waarop een land ophoudt lid te zijn, deelt het niet langer in de winsten of verliezen van de Bank, noch wordt het betrokken bij verplichtingen ten aanzien van leningen en garanties die daarna door de Bank worden verstrekt. Het blijft echter verantwoordelijk voor alle bedragen die het de Bank verschuldigd is en voor zijn voorwaardelijke verplichtingen jegens de Bank zolang enig deel van de leningen of garanties die door de Bank werden aangegaan voordat het ophield lid te zijn, nog uitstaat.  

(b) Wanneer een land ophoudt lid te zijn, treft de Bank maatregelen voor de terugkoop van het kapitaal van dat land als onderdeel van de vereffening der rekeningen ingevolge de bepalingen van dit lid; het land heeft echter geen andere rechten krachtens deze Overeenkomst met uitzondering van die welke zijn bepaald in deze sectie en in artikel XIII, sectie 2.  

(c) De Bank en het land dat ophoudt lid te zijn kunnen overeenstemming bereiken over de terugkoop van het kapitaal op voorwaarden die onder de omstandigheden passend worden geacht, zonder de bepalingen van letter (d) in aanmerking te nemen. Een zodanige overeenstemming kan onder andere voorzien in een definitieve regeling voor de nakoming van alle verplichtingen van het land jegens de Bank.  

(d) Indien de in de vorige sectie bedoelde overeenstemming niet is bereikt binnen zes maanden nadat het land ophoudt lid te zijn of binnen een zodanige andere termijn als de Bank en dat land overeenkomen, is de terugkoopprijs van het kapitaal van dat land de boekwaarde ervan overeenkomstig de boeken van de Bank op de datum waarop het land ophield lid te zijn. Een zodanige terugkoop geschiedt op de volgende voorwaarden: 

(i) Als eerste vereiste voor betaling dient het land dat ophoudt lid te zijn zijn aandelen-certificaten in te leveren en deze betaling dient te geschieden in de termijnen, op de tijdstippen en in de beschikbare valuta's die de Bank bepaalt, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de financiële positie van de Bank.  

(ii) Bedragen die de Bank het land verschuldigd is voor de terugkoop van zijn kapitaal worden ingehouden voor zover het land of een van zijn instanties verantwoordelijk blijft jegens de Bank als gevolg van de verstrekte leningen of garanties. Het ingehouden bedrag kan, ter keuze van de Bank, op de vervaldag voor iedere verplichting van die aard worden aangewezen. Er wordt echter geen bedrag ingehouden uit hoofde van de voorwaardelijke verplichting van het land voortspruitende uit zijn inschrijvingin gevolge artikel II, sectie 4 (a) (ii) of artikel IIA, sectie 3 (c).  

(iii) Indien de Bank netto-verliezen lijdt op enige lening of deelname in een lening of als gevolg van enige garantie die uitstond op de datum waarop het land ophield lid te zijn en het bedrag van deze verliezen het bedrag der met het oog hierop gevormde reserves op die datum te boven gaat, betaalt het desbetreffende land desgevraagd het bedrag terug waarmee de terugkoopprijs van zijn aandelen verminderd zou zijn indien met de verliezen rekening zou zijn gehouden bij de vaststelling van de boekwaarde der aandelen overeenkomstig de boeken van de Bank. Bovendien blijft het gewezen lid aansprakelijk voor iedere oproep ingevolge artikel II, sectie 4 (a) (ii) of artikel IIA, sectie 3 (c) tot hetzelfde bedrag waarvoor het verplicht zou zijn op te komen indien het kapitaalverlies en de oproep zouden hebben plaatsgevonden op het ogenblik dat de terugkoopprijs van zijn aandelen werd vastgesteld.    

(e) In een geval wordt enig aan een land voor zijn aandelen krachtens deze sectie verschuldigd bedrag eerder betaald dan zes maanden na de datum waarop het land ophoudt lid te zijn. Indien de Bank binnen die termijn haar werkzaamheden beëindigt, worden alle rechten van het destreffende land vastgesteld volgens de bepalingen van artikel X en zulk een land wordt ter zake van dat artikel als een lid van de Bank beschouwd, doch heeft geen stemrecht.     

### Artikel  X  

####STAKING EN BEËINDIGING DER WERKZAAMHEDEN

Sectie 1.   *Staking der werkzaamheden*  In geval van onvoorziene omstandigheden kan de Raad van Bewindvoerders de werkzaamheden ten aanzien van nieuwe leningen en garanties opschorten, tot het tijdstip waarop de Raad van Bestuur in de gelegenheid is de situatie te overwegen en maatregelen ter zake te nemen.   
Sectie 2.   *Beëindiging der werkzaamheden*  De Bank kan haar werkzaamheden beëindigen bij beslissing van de Raad van Bestuur, genomen met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders der regionale leden. Na haar werkzaamheden aldus te hebben beëindigd, houdt de Bank onmiddellijk op met alle werkzaamheden, behalve die welke nodig zijn voor het in stand houden, het beschermen en het te gelde maken van haar activa en het vereffenen van haar schulden.   
Sectie 3.   *Verplichtingen van leden en betaling van vorderingen*  

(a) De verplichting van alle leden voortspruitende uit de inschrijvingen op het kapitaal van de Bank en ten aanzien van de waardevermindering van hun valuta's blijft bestaan totdat alle directe en voorwaardelijke verplichtingen zijn voldaan.  

(b) Alle krediteuren die directe vorderingen hebben, worden eerst betaald uit de activa van de Bank ten laste van welke deze vorderingen komen en vervolgens uit de aan de Bank verrichte betalingen wegens niet-betaalde of niet-volgestorte inschrijvingen ten laste van welke zodanige vorderingen komen. Voordat betalingen aan krediteuren die directe vorderingen hebben, plaatsvinden, treft de Raad van Bewindvoerders de naar zijn mening nodige maatregelen ter verzekering van een verdeling pro rata onder de houders van directe en voorwaardelijke vorderingen.     
Sectie 4.   *Verdeling der activa*  

(a) Er vindt geen verdeling van activa aan de leden uit hoofde van hun inschrijving op het kapitaal van de Bank plaats voordat aan alle verplichtingen tegenover de krediteuren die ten laste van dat kapitaal komen, is voldaan of deze verplichtingen zijn geregeld. Bovendien dient deze verdeling te worden goedgekeurd bij beslissing van de Raad van Bestuur, genomen met een drie vierde meerderheid van het totaal aantal stemmen van de lid-landen, waaronder begrepen een twee derde meerderheid van de bestuurders der regionale leden.  

(b) De verdeling der activa van de Bank onder de leden dient te geschieden naar verhouding van de deelneming van elk der leden in het kapitaal en wordt van kracht op het tijdstip en onder de voorwaarden die de Bank redelijk en billijk acht. De aandelen in de verdeelde activa behoeven niet gelijk te zijn naar soorten activa. Geen enkel lid is gerechtigd zijn aandeel in een verdeling van de activa te ontvangen, voordat het al zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Bank is nagekomen.  

(c) Elk lid dat activa ontvangt die ingevolge dit artikel zijn verdeeld, geniet ten aanzien van deze activa dezelfde rechten als de Bank voor de verdeling daarvan genoot.     

### Artikel  XI

De Bank mag geen proces worden aangedaan door leden of personen die optreden voor of vorderingen hebben op leden. Ter regeling van geschillen tussen de Bank en haar leden dienen lid-landen evenwel gebruik te maken van daartoe in deze Overeenkomst, in de verordeningen en voorschriften van de Bank of in met de Bank gesloten overeenkomsten opgenomen bijzondere procedures.

(ii) indien de plaats waar, of de valuta waarin de papieren zijn uitgegeven of waarin zij luiden of betaalbaar gesteld of betaald zijn, of de plaats waar een kantoor van de Bank is gevestigd of waar zij haar bedrijf uitoefent, de enige rechtsgrond voor een dergelijke belasting zou zijn.    

(d) Er wordt geen belasting van welke aard ook geheven op door de Bank gegarandeerde schuldbekentenissen of waardepapieren, met inbegrip van de dividenden of interesten daarvan, onverschillig wie daarvan de houder is: 

(i) die een discriminatie inhoudt tegen zulk een schuldbekentenis of waardepapier, uitsluitend uit hoofde van derzelfder garantie door de Bank; of

Sectie 10.   *Toepassing*  Ieder lid neemt overeenkomstig zijn wetgeving de nodige stappen om op zijn grondgebied aan de bepalingen, neergelegd in dit artikel, uitvoering te geven en stelt de Bank van de genomen maatregelen in kennis.

Op enig tijdstip op of na de datum waarop zijn akte van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging wordt nedergelegd, kan een lid aanvullende betalingen doen waarvoor hij wordt gekrediteerd uit hoofde van zijn inschrijving en quota vastgesteld in de artikelen II en IV. Het Secretariaat-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten houdt alle krachtens dit lid betaalde fondsen in een bijzondere deposito-rekening of bijzondere deposito-rekeningen en stelt die fondsen ter beschikking van de Bank op een tijdstip dat valt vóór de eerste vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur die wordt gehouden ingevolge sectie 3 van dit artikel. Indien deze Overeenkomst niet op 31 december 1959 van kracht is geworden, betaalt het Secretariaat-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten die fondsen terug aan de landen die deze hebben gestort.  

(d) Op of na de datum waarop de Bank haar werkzaamheden begint, kan het Secretariaat-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten de ondertekening en de akte van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging van deze Overeenkomst ontvangen van ieder land wiens lidmaatschap is goedgekeurd in overeenstemming met artikel II, sectie 1 (b).     
Sectie 2.   *Inwerkingtreding*  

(a) Deze Overeenkomst treedt in werking wanneer zij is ondertekend en akten van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging zijn nedergelegd in overeenstemming met sectie 1 (a) van dit artikel door vertegenwoordigers van de landen wier inschrijvingen niet minder bedragen dan 85 procent van het totaal der inschrijvingen vermeld in bijlage A.  

(b) Landen waarvan akten van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging werden nedergelegd vóór de datum waarop de Overeenkomst van kracht werd, worden lid op die datum. Andere landen worden lid op de data waarop hun akten van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging worden nedergelegd.     
Sectie 3.   *Begin van de werkzaamheden*  

(a) De Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten belegt de eerste vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur zodra deze Overeenkomst van kracht wordt ingevolge sectie 2 van dit artikel.  

(b) Op zijn eerste vergadering treft de Raad van Bestuur regelingen voor de verkiezing van de Bewindvoerders en hun plaatsvervangers overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VIII, sectie 3, en voor de vaststelling van de datum waarop de Bank haar werkzaamheden begint. Onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel VIII, sectie 3, kunnen de bestuurders, indien zij zulks wenselijk achten, beslissen dat de eerste ambtstermijn van de Bewindvoerders minder dan drie jaar zal zijn.

Aangezien in artikel II, sectie 1 (b), van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank wordt bepaald dat niet-regionale landen die lid zijn van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en Zwitserland kunnen worden toegelaten als lid van de Bank krachtens de algemene regels die de Raad van Bestuur heeft opgesteld; Aangezien bepaalde niet-regionale landen uitdrukking hebben gegeven aan hun belangstelling om lid te worden van de Bank; en Aangezien de Raad van Bestuur tot de slotsom is gekomen dat het wenselijk zou zijn zodanige niet-regionale landen toe te laten als lid van de Bank en dat hun toelating tot stand dient te worden gebracht door (i) de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank te wijzigen ten einde onder andere te voorzien in de vorming van een nieuwe categorie aandelenkapitaal die het inter-regionaal aandelenkapitaal van de Bank zal worden genoemd; (ii) algemene regels betreffende de toelating van niet-regionale lid-landen aan te nemen, met inbegrip van bepalingen voor een vergroting van de middelen van het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties en (iii) het gewoon maatschappelijk kapitaal van de Bank te verhogen, Besluit de Raad van Bestuur dat: De aangehechte Algemene Regels betreffende de toelating van niet-regionale landen tot het lidmaatschap van de Bank worden goedgekeurd.

###Sectie 2. *Inschrijvingen op het interregionaal aandelenkapitaal*

(a) De in sectie 1 vermelde niet-regionale landen kunnen inschrijven op aandelen van het interregionaal kapitaal.  

(b) Iedere inschrijving omvat ten minste het volle bedrag van zowel de interregionale volgestorte aandelen als de interregionale niet-volgestorte aandelen toegewezen aan het desbetreffende in sectie 1 vermelde land, en elk inschrijvend land stelt de Bank ervan in kennis dat het alle noodzakelijke maatregelen ter goedkeuring van zijn inschrijving heeft genomen en verstrekt de Bank de inlichtingen daaromtrent die deze eventueel vraagt.  

(c) De inschrijving van ieder land op het interregionale volgestorte kapitaal geschiedt op de volgende voorwaarden: 

(i) de inschrijving per aandeel bedraagt VS$10.000,- uitgedrukt in VS-dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959.  

(ii) Het door ieder land op het interregionale volgestorte kapitaal ingeschreven bedrag wordt betaald in drie gelijke termijnen, met dien verstande dat de Raad van Bewindvoerders, rekening houdend met bijzondere omstandigheden ten aanzien van bepaalde landen, ermede kan instemmen (i) dat het bedrag van de eerste termijnbetaling te voldoen door het desbetreffende land kan worden verlaagd tot niet minder dan 20% van het bedrag van het aan een zodanig land toegewezen volgestorte kapitaal, waarbij de twee daaropvolgende termijnen dienovereenkomstig worden aangepast; of (ii) dat het desbetreffende land in vijf gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen kan betalen. De eerste termijn wordt door de landen betaald binnen 30 dagen nadat deze Algemene Regels van kracht zijn geworden of op of vóór de datum van nederlegging van de akte van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging overeenkomstig sectie 4 (c) (ii), welk van deze data het laatste valt. Indien een land verkiest de eerste termijn in gereed geld te voldoen, kan het de betaling verrichten uiterlijk aan het einde van het kalenderjaar waarin deze Algemene Regels van kracht worden of van het kalenderjaar waarin het lid zijn akte van bekrachtiging nederlegt, zo dit laatste tijdstip later valt. Iedere resterende jaarlijkse termijn vervalt telkens een jaar na de datum waarop de eerste termijn vervalt.  

(iii) Iedere termijn wordt geheel betaald in de valuta van het bijdragende land dat ten genoegen van de Bank regelingen treft ten einde te verzekeren dat die valuta vrij inwisselbaar is in de valuta's van andere landen ten behoeve van de werkzaamheden van de Bank.  

(iv) 50% van iedere termijnbetaling valt onder de bepalingen van artikel V, sectie 1 (b) (i) van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank en dient in gereed geld te worden betaald. Tenzij een land verkiest de resterende 50% van iedere termijn eveneens in gereed geld te betalen, stelt de Raad van Bewindvoerders ten aanzien hiervan een regeling op volgens welke alle ingevolge artikel V, sectie 4 aanvaarde, niet-verhandelbare, niet-rentedragende promessen of soortgelijke waardepapieren aan de Bank dienen te worden betaald.    

(d) De inschrijving van elk land op het niet-volgestorte interregionale aandelenkapitaal geschiedt op de volgende voorwaarden: 

(i) er wordt ingeschreven op aandelen van V.S.$10.000,- per stuk, uitgedrukt in V.S.-dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze golden op 1 januari 1959.  

(ii) De inschrijving van elk land op het niet-volgestorte interregionale aandelenkapitaal geschiedt in drie gelijke termijnen waarop onderscheidenlijk wordt ingeschreven op of voor de overeenkomstige betaaldata van elk der eerste drie termijnen van de inschrijving van het desbetreffende land op het volgestorte interregionale aandelenkapitaal ingevolge sectie 2 (c) (ii).    

(e) De interregionale kapitaalmiddelen worden gebruikt voor het verstrekken van leningen op een zodanige wijze dat een redelijke verdeling van die leningen en de daaruit voortvloeiende verplichtingen tussen gewone en interregionale kapitaalmiddelen wordt verzekerd.  

(f) Op het tijdstip waarop de Bank aan al haar geldelijke verplichtingen uit hoofde van al haar leningen die op 31 december 1974 op het gewone kapitaal uitstonden, heeft voldaan, worden maatregelen genomen tot samensmelting van het interregionale aandelenkapitaal en het gewone aandelenkapitaal.   
###Sectie 3. *Verhoging van het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties en de bijdragen hiervoor*

(a) Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van deze Algemene Regels worden de middelen van het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties verhoogd met de tegenwaarde van V.S. $506.664.161 door middel van bijdragen van niet-regionale landen, waarbij uit hun goedkeuring van deze Algemene Regels wordt begrepen dat de regionale lid-landen geen gebruik wensen te maken van hun recht bij te dragen in een evenredig aandeel van een dergelijke verhoging ingevolge artikel IV, sectie 3 (g) van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank.  

(b) Een dergelijke verhoging wordt eerst van kracht en zodanige bijdragen dienen eerst te worden betaald bij inwerkingtreding van deze Algemene Regels ingevolge sectie 10.  

(c) De waarde van de bijdragen van niet-regionale landen aan het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties is gelijk aan die van hun inschrijving op niet-regionaal aandelenkapitaal ingevolge sectie 1 (c).  

(d) Ieder land betaalt zijn bijdrage geheel in zijn eigen valuta en treft ten genoegen van de Bank regelingen ten einde te verzekeren dat die valuta vrij inwisselbaar is in de valuta's van andere landen ten behoeve van de operaties van de Bank.  

(e) Het gehele bedrag van iedere bijdrage wordt gevormd door nationale valuta waarop de bepalingen van artikel V, sectie 1 (c) van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank van toepassing zijn. Ingeval een land verkiest zijn gehele bijdrage of een deel daarvan niet in gereed geld te betalen, dan aanvaardt de Bank ingevolge artikel V, sectie 4 van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank, niet-verhandelbare niet-rentedragende promessen of soortgelijke waardepapieren waarvoor de Raad van Bewindvoerders een schema voor de verzilvering opstelt.  

(f) De bijdragen worden in drie gelijke termijnen voldaan, met dien verstande dat de Raad van Bewindvoerders, rekening houdend met bijzondere omstandigheden ten aanzien van bepaalde landen, ermede kan instemmen (i) dat het bedrag van de eerste termijn te betalen door het desbetreffende land kan worden verlaagd tot niet minder dan 20% van het bedrag van de totale aan een zodanig land toegewezen bijdrage, waarbij de twee daaropvolgende termijnen dienovereenkomstig worden aangepast; of (ii) dat het desbetreffende land in vijf gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen kan betalen. Het land betaalt zijn termijnen op dezelfde data als die waarop het zijn termijnen van het volgestorte interregionale aandelenkapitaal ingevolge sectie 2 betaalt.  

(g) Iedere betaling van een land beloopt een zodanig bedrag als de Bank acht gelijkwaardig te zijn aan de volledige waarde uitgedrukt in V.S. dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals die golden na de wijziging van 18 oktober 1973 in de pari-waarde van de V.S. dollar.  

(h) Valuta's van alle leden die de Bank onder haar berusting heeft en die zijn verkregen uit deze bijdragen, zijn onderworpen aan de bepalingen betreffende de handhaving van de waarde van artikel V, sectie 3, van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank, maar de waarde die voor dit doel wordt aangehouden, is de V.S. dollar van het gewicht en niet et gehalte zoals deze gelden na de wijziging van 18 oktober 1973 in de pari-waarde van de V.S. dollar, met dien verstande echter dat de Bank deze heraanpassing ter zijde kan stellen in geval van een herziening van valuta's waarbij een belangrijk aantal leden van de Bank is betrokken.  

(i) Onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel IV, sectie 3 (g), van de Overeenkomst tot Oprichting van de Bank, en in overeenstemming met de gebruikelijke methode om de middelen van het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties te vermeerderen, dient elke toekomstige vergroting van de middelen van het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties van de omvang en op de voorwaarden te zijn die op dat tijdstip door onderhandeling worden overeengekomen.   
###Sectie 4. *Vereisten voor het lidmaatschap van niet-regionale landen*

Een niet-regionaal land wordt lid van de Bank wanneer: 

(a) de Raad van Bewindvoerders heeft vastgesteld dat aan alle voorwaarden van sectie 1 is voldaan;  

(b) deze Algemene Regels van kracht zijn geworden ingevolge sectie 10; en  

(c) de President heeft verklaard dat het land heeft voldaan aan alle onderstaande vereisten: 

(i) zijn behoorlijk gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger heeft zijn handtekening gesteld op het oorspronkelijk exemplaar van de Overeenkomst, zoals gewijzigd, dat is nedergelegd bij het Secretariaat-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten;  

(ii) het land heeft bij het Secretariaat-Generaal van de Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten een akte nedergelegd waarin wordt verklaard dat dit land, in overeenstemming met zijn wetgeving, de Overeenkomst en alle in deze Algemene Regels gestelde voorwaarden heeft aanvaard of bekrachtigd, en dat het de nodige maatregelen heeft getroffen om aan al zijn verplichtingen krachtens de Overeenkomst en krachtens deze Algemene Regels te voldoen; en  

(iii) het land heeft de Bank ervan in kennis gesteld dat het alle nodige stappen heeft ondernomen ter ondertekening van de Overeenkomst en ter nederlegging van de akte van aanvaarding of bekrachtiging zoals bedoeld onder (i) en (ii) hierboven en het heeft de Bank de eventueel door haar verzochte inlichtingen met betrekking tot die stappen verstrekt.     
###Sectie 5. *Andere niet-regionale landen*

Andere niet in sectie 1 vermelde niet-regionale landen kunnen lid worden van de Bank op de voorwaarden die de Raad van Bestuur vaststelt. De inschrijvingen van die andere niet-regionale landen en hun onderscheiden bijdragen aan het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties omvatten het aantal aandelen van het volgestorte en niet-volgestorte interregionale aandelenkapitaal en de bijdragen aan het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties die de Raad van Bestuur vaststelt, zulks met inachtneming van de voorwaarden voor de inschrijvingen en bijdragen van de in sectie 1 vermelde niet-regionale landen. 
###Sectie 6. *Niet-geplaatst kapitaal en bijdragenquota's*

Op het interregionaal aandelenkapitaal en de bijdragenquota's aan het Fonds voor Speciale Operaties zoals bepaald in sectie 1 (c) van deze Algemene Regels, waarop niet binnen twee jaar na de datum waarop deze Algemene Regels van kracht zijn geworden, is ingeschreven door de in sectie 1 vermelde niet-regionale landen of door andere niet-regionale landen zoals bedoeld in sectie 5, kan daarna worden ingeschreven door de niet-regionale lid-landen die op dat tijdstip lid zijn. Ieder zodanig lid heeft het recht in te schrijven voor dat deel van het beschikbare kapitaal dat gelijk is aan de verhouding waarin de aandelen waarvoor het reeds heeft ingeschreven staan tot het totale geplaatste interregionale kapitaal.
