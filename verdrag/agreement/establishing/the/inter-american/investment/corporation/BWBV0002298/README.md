####Overeenkomst tot oprichting van de Inter-Amerikaanse Investeringsmaatschappij

De landen namens welke deze Overeenkomst is ondertekend, komen overeen de Inter-Amerikaanse Investeringsmaatschappij op te richten, waarop de volgende bepalingen van toepassing zijn:    

### Artikel  I  

####Doel en taken

###Afdeling 1. *Doel*

Het doel van de Maatschappij is de economische ontwikkeling te bevorderen van haar in ontwikkeling zijnde regionale lid-landen door de oprichting, uitbreiding en modernisering aan te moedigen van particuliere ondernemingen, bij voorkeur de kleine en middelgrote, zodat de werkzaamheden van de Inter-Amerikaanse Ontwikkelingsbank (hierna te noemen „de Bank”) worden aangevuld. Ondernemingen in het aandelenkapitaal waaraan gedeeltelijk wordt deelgenomen door de regering of andere openbare lichamen, wier werkzaamheden de particuliere sector van de economie versterken, komen in aanmerking voor financiering door de Maatschappij. 
###Afdeling 2. *Taken*

Voor de verwezenlijking van haar doel verricht de Maatschappij de volgende taken ter ondersteuning van de in afdeling 1 bedoelde ondernemingen: 

(a) Het bijstaan, alleen of te zamen met andere leningverstrekkers of investeerders, in de financiering van de oprichting, uitbreiding en modernisering van ondernemingen, waarbij de Maatschappij de instrumenten en/of procedures hanteert die zij in elk afzonderlijk geval passend acht;  

(b) Het vergemakkelijken van toegang van deze ondernemingen tot binnenlands en buitenlands particulier en door de overheid verstrekt kapitaal, en tot technische en bedrijfskundige kennis;  

(c) Het stimuleren van de ontwikkeling van investeringsmogelijkheden die de toestroming bevorderen van binnenlands en buitenlands particulier en door de overheid verstrekt kapitaal naar investeringen in de lid-landen;  

(d) Het nemen, in elk afzonderlijk geval, van passende en noodzakelijke maatregelen voor de financiering van die ondernemingen, indachtig hun behoeften en de beginselen gebaseerd op een zorgvuldig beheer van de middelen van de Maatschappij; en  

(e) Het verschaffen van technische samenwerking ten behoeve van opstelling, financiering en uitvoering van projecten, met inbegrip van overdracht van passende technologie.   
###Afdeling 3. *Beleid*

De werkzaamheden van de Maatschappij worden verricht overeenkomstig de beleidslijnen voor de exploitatie, financiering en investeringen die uitvoerig zijn omschreven in de door de Raad van Bewindvoerders van de Maatschappij goedgekeurde voorschriften, welke voorschriften door deze Raad kunnen worden gewijzigd.  

### Artikel  II  

####Leden en kapitaal

###Afdeling 1. *Leden*

(a) De leden die de Maatschappij hebben opgericht zijn die lid-landen van de Bank die deze Overeenkomst op de in artikel XI, afdeling l(a) aangegeven datum hebben ondertekend en de aanvankelijke betaling vereist in afdeling 3(b) van dit artikel hebben verricht.  

(b) De andere lid-landen van de Bank kunnen tot deze Overeenkomst toetreden op de datum en overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die de Raad van Bestuur van de Maatschappij bepaalt met een meerderheid die ten minste twee derde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigt, twee derde van de bestuurders daaronder begrepen.  

(c) Het woord „leden” zoals gebruikt in deze Overeenkomst heeft alleen betrekking op lid-landen van de Bank die lid van de Maatschappij zijn.   
###Afdeling 2. *Middelen*

(a) Het maatschappelijk aandelenkapitaal van de Maatschappij bedraagt aanvankelijk tweehonderd miljoen dollar van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika (VS$200.000.000).  

(b) Het maatschappelijk aandelenkapitaal wordt verdeeld in twintigduizend (20.000) aandelen met een pari-waarde van tienduizend VS-dollar (VSS 10.000) per aandeel. Op aandelen waarop niet overeenkomstig afdeling 3(a) van dit artikel, aanvankelijk is ingeschreven door de leden die de Maatschappij hebben opgericht, kan later worden ingeschreven overeenkomstig afdeling 3(d) van dit artikel.  

(c) De Raad van Bestuur kan het maatschappelijk aandelenkapitaal als volgt verhogen: 

(i) met twee derde van de stemmen van de leden, wanneer zulk een verhoging nodig is ten behoeve van de uitgifte van aandelen, op het tijdstip van de aanvankelijke inschrijving, aan andere leden van de Bank dan de leden die de Maatschappij hebben opgericht, met dien verstande dat het totaal van ingevolge deze alinea toegestane verhogingen niet groter is dan 2.000 aandelen;  

(ii) in alle andere gevallen, met een meerderheid die ten minste drie vierde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigt, twee derde van de bestuurders daaronder begrepen.    

(d) Naast het bovenbedoelde maatschappelijk kapitaal kan de Raad van Bestuur, na de datum waarop het aanvankelijke maatschappelijk kapitaal volledig is volgestort, de uitgifte toestaan van niet-volgestort kapitaal, en de voorwaarden vaststellen voor de inschrijving daarop, en wel als volgt: 

(i) Dit besluit wordt goedgekeurd door een meerderheid die ten minste drie vierde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigt, twee derde van de bestuurders daaronder begrepen; en  

(ii) het niet-volgestorte kapitaal wordt verdeeld in aandelen met een pari-waarde van tienduizend VS-dollar (VS$ 10.000) elk.    

(e) De niet-volgestorte kapitaalaandelen kunnen slechts worden gevorderd wanneer de Maatschappij deze nodig heeft om te voldoen aan haar verplichtingen aangegaan krachtens artikel III, afdeling 7(a). In geval van een zodanige vordering kan de betaling naar keuze van het lid geschieden in VS-dollars, of in de valuta die nodig is om te voldoen aan de verplichtingen van de Maatschappij die aanleiding zijn tot het verzoek tot storting. Vorderingen tot storting met betrekking tot aandelen dienen uniform en naar verhouding van alle aandelen te zijn. De verplichtingen van de leden de aldus gevorderde betalingen te verrichten zijn onafhankelijk van elkaar en het in gebreke blijven van een of meer leden om de aldus gevorderde betalingen te verrichten, ontslaat andere leden niet van hun verplichting de betaling te verrichten. Er kunnen achtereenvolgende verzoeken worden gedaan indien zulks nodig is om te voldoen aan de verplichtingen van de Maatschappij.  

(f) De andere middelen van de Maatschappij bestaan uit: 

(i) bedragen opkomend als dividenden, provisies, rente en andere fondsen afkomstig uit de investeringen van de Maatschappij;  

(ii) bedragen ontvangen bij de verkoop van investeringen of de terugbetaling van leningen;  

(iii) bedragen die door middel van leningen door de Maatschappij worden verkregen; en  

(iv) andere bijdragen en aan haar beheer toevertrouwde fondsen.     
###Afdeling 3. *Inschrijvingen*

(a) Ieder lid dat de Maatschappij heeft opgericht, schrijft in op het aantal aandelen vermeld in Bijlage A.  

(b) De storting van het kapitaal door elk lid dat de Maatschappij heeft opgericht, als vermeld in Bijlage A, geschiedt in vier jaarlijkse, gelijke, opeenvolgende termijnen van elk vijfentwintig procent van het bedrag. De eerste termijn wordt door elk lid volledig betaald binnen drie maanden na de datum waarop de Maatschappij met haar werkzaamheden begint ingevolge artikel XI, afdeling 3 hieronder, of de datum waarop dit lid dat de Maatschappij heeft opgericht tot deze Overeenkomst toetreedt, dan wel de datum of data daarna door de Raad van Bewindvoerders van de Maatschappij te bepalen. De overige drie termijnen worden betaald op de data die worden vastgesteld door de Raad van Bewindvoerders van de Maatschappij maar niet eerder dan onderscheidenlijk 31 december 1985, 31 december 1986 en 31 december 1987. De betaling van elk der laatste drie termijnen van het kapitaal waarop door ieder van de lid-landen is ingeschreven, is afhankelijk van de vervulling van in de onderscheiden landen eventueel vereiste wettelijke formaliteiten. De betaling geschiedt in VS-dollars. De Maatschappij noemt de plaats of plaatsen van betaling.  

(c) Aandelen waarop aanvankelijk door de leden die de Maatschappij hebben opgericht, is ingeschreven worden uitgegeven tegen pari.  

(d) De voorwaarden betreffende de inschrijving op aandelen die worden uitgegeven na de aanvankelijke inschrijving op aandelen door de leden die de Maatschappij hebben opgericht, en waarop niet is ingeschreven krachtens artikel II, afdeling 2(b), alsmede de data van betaling daarvan, worden bepaald door de Raad van Bewindvoerders van de Maatschappij.   
###Afdeling 4. *Beperking op overdrachten of verpanding van aandelen*

De aandelen van de Maatschappij kunnen op generlei wijze worden verpand, bezwaard of overgedragen, behalve aan de Maatschappij, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur van de Maatschappij een overdracht tussen leden goedkeurt met een meerderheid van de bestuurders die vier vijfde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen. 
###Afdeling 5. *Voorkeursrecht tot inschrijving*

In geval van een verhoging van het kapitaal overeenkomstig afdeling 2(c) en (d) van dit artikel heeft elk lid recht, op de voorwaarden die door de Maatschappij kunnen worden gesteld, op een percentage van de bijkomende aandelen overeenkomend met de verhouding waarin de aandelen waarop hij tot dusverre had ingeschreven staan tot het totale kapitaal van de Maatschappij. Een lid is evenwel niet verplicht in te schrijven op een deel van het verhoogde kapitaal. 
###Afdeling 6. *Beperking van aansprakelijkheid*

De aansprakelijkheid van de leden ten aanzien van de aandelen waarop zij hebben ingeschreven is beperkt tot het niet volgestorte deel van de uitgifteprijs. Een lid is niet, op grond van zijn lidmaatschap, aansprakelijk voor verplichtingen van de Maatschappij.

(g) Alle stemmen die een Bewindvoerder gerechtigd is uit te brengen, worden als eenheid uitgebracht.  

(h) In geval van tijdelijke afwezigheid van een Bewindvoerder en zijn plaatsvervanger, kan de Bewindvoerder of, in diens afwezigheid de plaatsvervangend Bewindvoerder, iemand benoemen om hen te vertegenwoordigen.

Een zodanige uittreding gaat in op de in de kennisgeving vermelde datum, doch in geen geval eerder dan zes maanden na de datum waarop de kennisgeving door de Maatschappij werd ontvangen. Het lid kan, te allen tijde voordat de uittreding ingaat, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Maatschappij, afzien van zijn voornemen tot uittreding.

(c) Zolang een lid geschorst is, kan het geen van de bij deze Overeenkomst aan hem verleende rechten uitoefenen, behalve het recht van opzegging, doch blijft het gebonden al zijn verplichtingen te vervullen.   
###Afdeling 3. *Voorwaarden bij uittreding*

(a) Vanaf het tijdstip waarop het lidmaatschap ophoudt, deelt een lid niet langer in de winsten of verliezen van de instelling en wordt het evenmin aansprakelijk gesteld ten aanzien van leningen en garanties die daarna door de Maatschappij worden verstrekt. De Maatschappij treft maatregelen voor de terugkoop van het kapitaal van dat lid als onderdeel van de vereffening der rekeningen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze afdeling.  

(b) De Maatschappij en een lid kunnen bij de opzegging van het lidmaatschap en de terugkoop van aandelen van genoemd lid overeenstemming bereiken op onder de omstandigheden passende voorwaarden. Indien zulk een overeenstemming niet is bereikt binnen drie maanden na het tijdstip waarop zulk een lid uiting geeft aan zijn wens, het lidmaatschap op te zeggen, of binnen een tussen beide partijen overeengekomen termijn, is de terugkoopprijs van de aandelen van het lid gelijk aan de boekwaarde ervan op het tijdstip waarop het lid ophoudt tot de instelling te behoren, welke boekwaarde wordt bepaald door de door accountants gecertificeerde financiële overzichten van de Maatschappij  

(c) De betaling voor de aandelen geschiedt, na inlevering van de overeenkomende aandelen-certificaten, in de termijnen, op de tijdstippen en in de beschikbare valuta's die de Maatschappij bepaalt, waarbij zij rekening houdt met haar financiële positie.  

(d) Er mag geen bedrag dat krachtens deze afdeling aan een voormalig lid voor zijn aandelen verschuldigd is, worden betaald tot één maand na het tijdstip waarop dit lid ophoudt tot de instelling te behoren. Indien de Maatschappij binnen dat tijdvak de werkzaamheden staakt, worden de rechten van dat lid vastgesteld volgens de bepalingen van artikel VI en wordt zulk een lid ter zake van dat artikel als lid van de Maatschappij beschouwd, doch heeft het geen stemrecht.    

### Artikel  VI  

####Staking en beëindiging der werkzaamheden

###Afdeling 1. *Staking der werkzaamheden*

In geval van onvoorziene omstandigheden kan de Raad van Bewindvoerders de werkzaamheden ten aanzien van nieuwe investeringen, leningen en garanties opschorten, tot het tijdstip waarop de Raad van Bestuur in de gelegenheid is de situatie te onderzoeken en maatregelen ter zake te nemen. 
###Afdeling 2. *Beëindiging der werkzaamheden*

(a) De Maatschappij kan haar werkzaamheden beëindigen bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid die ten minste drie vierde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigt, twee derde van de bestuurders daaronder begrepen.

Voordat betalingen aan crediteuren die directe vorderingen hebben, plaatsvinden, treft de Raad van Bewindvoerders de naar zijn mening nodige maatregelen ter verzekering van een verdeling pro rata onder de houders van directe en voorwaardelijke vorderingen.   
###Afdeling 4. *Verdeling der activa*

(a) Er vindt geen verdeling van activa plaats onder de leden uit hoofde van de aandelen in de Maatschappij die zij in hun bezit hebben, voordat aan alle verplichtingen tegenover de crediteuren die ten laste van deze aandelen komen is voldaan of deze verplichtingen zijn geregeld. Bovendien dient deze verdeling te worden goedgekeurd bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid die ten minste drie vierde van de stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigt, twee derde van de bestuurders daaronder begrepen.  

(b) De verdeling van de activa onder de leden geschiedt naar verhouding van het aantal aandelen in hun bezit en wordt van kracht op het tijdstip en onder de voorwaarden die de Maatschappij redelijk en billijk acht. De aandelen in de verdeelde activa behoeven niet gelijk te zijn naar soorten activa. Geen enkel lid is gerechtigd zijn aandeel in een verdeling van de activa te ontvangen, voordat het al zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Maatschappij is nagekomen.  

(c) Elk lid dat activa ontvangt die ingevolge dit artikel zijn verdeeld, geniet ten aanzien van deze activa dezelfde rechten als de Maatschappij vóór de verdeling daarvan genoot.

Niettemin wenst zij het verlangen van Mexico te laten vastleggen een grotere deelneming in de aandelen van deze multilaterale organisaties te verwezenlijken, opdat, door middel van een systeem van objectieve indicatoren, het grote gewicht van het land wat betreft economie, bevolking en behoefte aan financiële steun voor zijn ontwikkelingsproces, beter wordt weergegeven.    </sup> |
