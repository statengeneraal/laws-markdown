In case of an increase in the authorized capital stock, each member shall have a reasonable opportunity to subscribe, under such terms and conditions as the Board of Governors shall determine, to a proportion of the increase of stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock theretofore subscribed bears to the total subscribed capital stock immediately prior to such increase; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not apply in respect of any increase or portion of an increase in the authorized capital stock intended solely to give effect to determinations of the Board of Governors under paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article.

The Board of Governors may, at the request of a member, increase the subscription of such member on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine; provided, however, that no such increase in the subscription of any member shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock held by regional members below sixty (60) per cent of the total subscribed capital stock.

Such notes or obligations shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing, and payable to the Bank at par value upon demand. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 (ii) of Article 24, demands upon such notes or obligations payable in convertible currencies shall, over reasonable periods of time, be uniform in percentage on all such notes or obligations.   
4.  Each payment of a member in its own currency under paragraph 2 (b) of this Article shall be in such amount as the Bank, after such consultation with the International Monetary Fund as the Bank may consider necessary and utilizing the par value established with the International Monetary Fund, if any, determines to be equivalent to the full value in terms of dollars of the portion of the subscription being paid. The initial payment shall be in such amount as the member considers appropriate hereunder but shall be subject to such adjustment, to be effected within ninety (90) days of the date on which such payment was due, as the Bank shall determine to be necessary to constitute the full dollar equivalent of such payment.

####Operating principles

The operations of the Bank shall be conducted in accordance with the following principles: 

(i) The operations of the Bank shall provide principally for the financing of specific projects, including those forming part of a national, sub-regional or regional development programme. They may, however, include loans to, or guarantees of loans made to, national development banks or other suitable entities, in order that the latter may finance specific development projects whose individual financing requirements are not, in the opinion of the Bank, large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank;  

(ii) In selecting suitable projects, the Bank shall always be guided by the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii) of Article 2 of this Agreement;  

(iii) The Bank shall not finance any undertaking in the territory of a member if that member objects to such financing;  

(iv) Before a loan is granted, the applicant shall have submitted an adequate loan proposal and the President of the Bank shall have presented to the Board of Directors a written report regarding the proposal, together with his recommendations, on the basis of a staff study;  

(v) In considering an application for a loan or guarantee, the Bank shall pay due regard to the ability of the borrower to obtain financing or facilities elsewhere on terms and conditions that the Bank considers reasonable for the recipient, taking into account all pertinent factors;  

(vi) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the Bank shall pay due regard to the prospects that the borrower and its guarantor, if any, will be in a position to meet their obligations under the loan contract;  

(vii) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the rate of interest, other charges and the schedule for repayment of principal shall be such as are, in the opinion of the Bank, appropriate for the loan concerned;  

(viii) In guaranteeing a loan made by other investors, or in underwriting the sale of securities, the Bank shall receive suitable compensation for its risk;  

(ix) The proceeds of any loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the ordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds established by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1 (i) of Article 19, shall be used only for procurement in member countries of goods and services produced in member countries, except in any case in which the Board of Directors, by a vote of the directors representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a non-member country or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances making such procurement appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of financing has been provided to the Bank;  

(x) In the case of a direct loan made by the Bank, the borrower shall be permitted by the Bank to draw its funds only to meet expenditures in connexion with the project as they are actually incurred;  

(xi) The Bank shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed or participated in by the Bank are used only for the purposes for which the loan was granted and with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency;  

(xii) The Bank shall pay due regard to the desirability of avoiding a disproportionate amount of its resources being used for the benefit of any member;  

(xiii) The Bank shall seek to maintain reasonable diversification in its investments in equity capital; it shall not assume responsibility for managing any entity or enterprise in which it has an investment, except where necessary to safeguard its investments; and  

(xiv) The Bank shall be guided by sound banking principles in its operations.    

### Article  15  

####Terms and conditions for direct loans and guarantees

1.  In the case of direct loans made or participated in or loans guaranteed by the Bank, the contract shall establish, in conformity with the operating principles set forth in Article 14 of this Agreement and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions for the loan or the guarantee concerned, including those relating to payment of principal, interest and other charges, maturities, and dates of payment in respect of the loan, or the fees and other charges in respect of the guarantee, respectively. In particular, the contract shall provide that, subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, all payments to the Bank under the contract shall be made in the currency loaned, unless, in the case of a direct loan made or a loan guaranteed as part of special operations with funds provided under paragraph 1 (ii) of Article 19, the rules and regulations of the Bank provide otherwise. Guarantees by the Bank shall also provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed.   
2.  Where the recipient of loans or guarantees of loans is not itself a member, the Bank may, when it deems it advisable, require that the member in whose territory the project concerned is to be carried out, or a public agency or any instrumentality of that member acceptable to the Bank, guarantee the repayment of the principal and the payment of interest and other charges on the loan in accordance with the terms thereof.   
3.  The loan or guarantee contract shall expressly state the currency in which all payments to the Bank thereunder shall be made. At the option of the borrower, however, such payments may always be made in gold or convertible currency.   

### Article  16  

####Commission and fees

1.  The Bank shall charge, in addition to interest, a commission on direct loans made or participated in as part of its ordinary operations. This commission, payable periodically, shall be computed on the amount outstanding on each loan or participation and shall be at the rate of not less than one per cent per annum, unless the Bank, after the first five years of its operations, decides to reduce this minimum rate by a two-thirds majority of its members, representing not less than three-fourths of the total voting power of the members.   
2.  In guaranteeing a loan as part of its ordinary operations, the Bank shall charge a guarantee fee, at a rate determined by the Board of Directors, payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding.   
3.  Other charges of the Bank in its ordinary operations and any commission, fees or other charges in its special operations shall be determined by the Board of Directors.   

### Article  17  

####Special reserve

The amount of commissions and guarantee fees received by the Bank pursuant to Article 16 of this Agreement shall be set aside as a special reserve which shall be kept for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Article 18 of this Agreement. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form as the Board of Directors may decide.  

### Article  18  

####Methods of meeting liabilities of the Bank

1.  In cases of default on loans made, participated in or guaranteed by the Bank in its ordinary operations, the Bank shall take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to modifying the terms of the loan, other than the currency of repayment.

(i) First, against the special reserve provided for in Article 17;  

(ii) Then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital available to the Bank.     
3.  Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on borrowings of the Bank in its ordinary operations, or to meet its liabilities with respect to similar payments in respect of loans guaranteed by it, chargeable to its ordinary capital resources, the Bank may call an appropriate amount of the uncalled subscribed callable capital in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 6 of this Agreement.   
4.  In cases of default in respect of a loan made from borrowed funds or guaranteed by the Bank as part of its ordinary operations, the Bank may, if it believes that the default may be of long duration, call an additional amount of such callable capital not to exceed in any one year one per cent of the total subscriptions of the members to such capital, for the following purposes: 

(i) To redeem before maturity, or otherwise discharge, the Bank's liability on all or part of the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in default; and  

(ii) To repurchase, or otherwise discharge, the Bank's liability on all or part of its own outstanding borrowing.     
5.  If the Bank's subscribed callable capital stock shall be entirely called pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the Bank may, if necessary for the purposes specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, use or exchange the currency of any member without restriction, including any restriction imposed pursuant to paragraphs 2 (i) and (ii) of Article 24.   

### Article  19  

####Special Funds

1.  The Bank may: 

(i) set aside, by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of Governors, representing at least three-fourths of the total voting power of the members, not more than ten (10) per cent each of the portion of the unimpaired paid-in capital of the Bank paid by members pursuant to paragraph 2 (a) of Article 6 and of the portion thereof paid pursuant to paragraph 2 (b) of Article 6, and establish therewith one or more Special Funds; and  

(ii) accept the administration of Special Funds which are designed to serve the purpose and come within the functions of the Bank.     
2.  Special Funds established by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1 (i) of this Article may be used to guarantee or make loans of high developmental priority, with longer maturities, longer deferred commencement of repayment and lower interest rates than those established by the Bank for its ordinary operations. Such Funds may also be used on such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this Agreement nor with the characters of such Funds as revolving funds, as the Bank in establishing such Funds may direct.   
3.  Special Funds accepted by the Bank under paragraph 1 (ii) of this Article may be used in any manner and on any terms and conditions not inconsistent with the purpose of the Bank and with the agreement relating to such Funds.

### Article  43  

####Settlement of accounts

1.  After the date on which a country ceases to be a member, it shall remain liable for its direct obligations to the Bank and for its contingent liabilities to the Bank so long as any part of the loans or guarantees contracted before it ceased to be a member is outstanding; but it shall not incur liabilities with respect to loans and guarantees entered into thereafter by the Bank nor share either in the income or the expenses of the Bank.   
2.  At the time a country ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such country's shares by the Bank as a part of the settlement of accounts with such country in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs .3 and 4 of this Article. For this purpose, the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member.   
3.  The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this Article shall be governed by the following conditions: 

(i) Any amount due to the country concerned for its shares shall be withheld so long as that country, its central bank or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No amount shall be withheld on account of the contingent liability of the country for future calls on its subscription for shares in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 of this Agreement. In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six (6) months after the date on which the country ceases to be a member.  

(ii) Payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon surrender of the corresponding stock certificates by the country concerned, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article exceeds the aggregate amount of liabilities on loans and guarantees referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, until the former member has received the full repurchase price.  

(iii) Payments shall be made in such available currencies as the Bank determines, taking into account its financial position.  

(iv) If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees or loans which were outstanding on the date when a country ceased to be a member and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserve provided against losses on that date, the country concerned shall repay, upon demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 of this Agreement, to the same extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.     
4.  If the Bank terminates its operations pursuant to Article 45 of this Agreement within six (6) months of the date upon which any country ceases to be a member, all rights of the country concerned shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 45 to 47 of this Agreement. Such country shall be considered as still a member for purposes of such articles but shall have no voting rights.

2.  All creditors holding direct claims shall first be paid out of the assets of the Bank and then out of payments to the Bank on unpaid or callable subscriptions. Before making any payments to creditors holding direct claims, the Board of Directors shall make such arrangements as are necessary, in its judgment, to ensure a *pro rata* distribution among holders of direct and contingent claims.   

### Article  47  

####Distribution of assets

1.

2.  Any distribution of the assets of the Bank to the members shall be in proportion to the capital stock held by each member and shall be effected at such times and under such conditions as the Bank shall deem fair and equitable. The shares of assets distributed need not be uniform as to type of asset. No member shall be entitled to receive its share in such a distribution of assets until it has settled all of its obligations to the Bank.

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Kapitaal

### Artikel  4  

####Maatschappelijk kapitaal

1.  Het maatschappelijk kapitaal van de Bank bedraagt een miljard dollar ($ 1.000.000.000), uitgedrukt in U.S. dollars van het gewicht en met het gehalte zoals deze gelden op 31 januari 1966. Overal waar in deze Overeenkomst wordt gesproken van dollars moet daaronder worden verstaan de U.S. dollar van de bovenvermelde waarde. Het maatschappelijk kapitaal is verdeeld in honderdduizend (100.000) aandelen, met een pari-waarde van tienduizend dollar ($ 10.000) elk, waarop overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 5 van deze Overeenkomst uitsluitend door leden kan worden ingeschreven.   
2.  Het oorspronkelijke maatschappelijk kapitaal wordt verdeeld in volgestorte aandelen en niet volgestorte aandelen. Tot een totale pariwaarde van vijfhonderd miljoen dollar ($ 500.000.000) bestaat het uit volgestorte aandelen, en tot een totale pari-waarde van vijfhonderd miljoen dollar ($ 500.000.000) uit niet volgestorte aandelen.   
3.  Het maatschappelijk kapitaal van de Bank kan door de Raad van Bestuur worden verhoogd op een zodanig tijdstip en op zodanige voorwaarden als de Raad wenselijk acht, en wel met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders, die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen der leden vertegenwoordigen.   

### Artikel  5  

####Inschrijving op aandelen

1.  Ieder lid schrijft in op de aandelen van het kapitaal van de Bank. Iedere inschrijving op het oorspronkelijke maatschappelijk kapitaal heeft voor gelijke delen betrekking op volgestorte aandelen en op niet volgestorte aandelen. Het aantal aandelen waarvoor aanvankelijk dient te worden ingeschreven door landen die lid worden overeenkomstig artikel 64 van deze Overeenkomst, is vermeld in Bijlage A bij deze Overeenkomst. Het aantal aandelen waarvoor aanvankelijk dient te worden ingeschreven door landen die worden toegelaten tot het lidmaatschap overeenkomstig artikel 3, tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst, wordt vastgesteld door de Raad van Bestuur, met dien verstande echter dat inschrijving niet is toegestaan, indien dit tot gevolg zou hebben dat het percentage kapitaal in handen van regionale leden wordt teruggebracht tot minder dan 60 (zestig) % van het totale geplaatste kapitaal.   
2.  De Raad van Bestuur herziet het kapitaal van de Bank met tussenpozen van niet minder dan 5 (vijf) jaar. In geval van verhoging van het maatschappelijk kapitaal krijgt ieder lid een redelijke gelegenheid onder door de Raad van Bestuur vast te stellen voorwaarden in te schrijven voor een deel van het bedrag waarmede het kapitaal wordt verhoogd dat gelijk is aan de verhouding waarin de aandelen waarvoor het reeds heeft ingeschreven staan tot het totale geplaatste kapitaal onmiddellijk voor de verhoging; met dien verstande echter dat deze bepaling niet van toepassing is op een verhoging of enig deel van een verhoging van het maatschappelijk kapitaal dat uitsluitend is bedoeld voor de tenuitvoerlegging van besluiten van de Raad van Bestuur ingevolge het eerste en derde lid van dit artikel. De leden zijn niet verplicht in te schrijven op een gedeelte van een verhoging van het kapitaal.   
3.  De Raad van Bestuur kan op verzoek van een lid de participatie van dat lid uitbreiden op door de Raad vast te stellen voorwaarden, met dien verstande echter dat uitbreiding van de inschrijving van een lid niet is toegestaan, indien dit tot gevolg zou hebben dat het percentage van het kapitaal in handen van regionale leden wordt teruggebracht tot minder dan 60 (zestig) % van het totale geplaatste kapitaal. De Raad van Bestuur schenkt bijzondere aandacht aan het verzoek van een regionaal lid dat minder dan 6 (zes) % van het geplaatste kapitaal bezit, tot vergroting van zijn evenredig deel daarvan.   
4.  De aandelen waarvoor de leden aanvankelijk hebben ingeschreven, worden uitgegeven a pari. De andere aandelen worden eveneens a pari uitgegeven, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van het totale aantal Bestuurders, die een meerderheid van het totale aantal stemmen der leden vertegenwoordigen, onder bijzondere omstandigheden besluit ze op andere voorwaarden uit te geven.   
5.  De aandelen worden op generlei wijze verpand of bezwaard en zijn slechts overdraagbaar aan de Bank, overeenkomstig Hoofdstuk VII van deze Overeenkomst.   
6.  De aansprakelijkheid van de leden uit hoofde van hun aandelenbezit is beperkt tot het niet betaalde gedeelte van de prijs van uitgifte.   
7.  De leden zijn niet op grond van hun lidmaatschap aansprakelijk voor verplichtingen van de Bank.   

### Artikel  6  

####Betaling der inschrijvingen

1.  Het aanvankelijk door degenen die deze Overeenkomst hebben ondertekend en die lid worden overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 64, op het gestorte kapitaal van de Bank ingeschreven bedrag wordt betaald in 5 (vijf) termijnen, elk van 20 (twintig) % van dat bedrag. De eerste termijn wordt door de leden betaald hetzij binnen 30 (dertig) dagen na het in werking treden van deze Overeenkomst, hetzij op of voor de datum van nederlegging namens dat lid van de akte van bekrachtiging of aanvaarding overeenkomstig het eerste lid van artikel 64, zo dit laatste tijdstip later valt. De tweede termijn vervalt een jaar na het in werking treden van deze Overeenkomst. De resterende drie termijnen vervallen achtereenvolgens telkens een jaar na de datum waarop de voorgaande termijn verviel.   
2.  Van elke termijnbetaling van de aanvankelijke inschrijvingen op het oorspronkelijke volgestorte kapitaal wordt 

(a) 50 (vijftig) procent betaald in goud of convertibele valuta, en  

(b) 50 (vijftig) procent in de valuta van het betrokken lid.     
3.  De Bank accepteert van een lid door de regering van dat lid of door de door dat lid aangewezen depositaris uitgegeven promessen of andere schuldbrieven, in plaats van het bedrag dat ingevolge het tweede lid, letter (b), van dit artikel moet worden betaald in de valuta van het lid, mits de Bank deze liquide middelen niet nodig heeft voor de uitvoering van haar werkzaamheden. De bedoelde promessen of schuldbrieven zijn niet verhandelbaar, niet rentedragend en op verzoek tegen pari-waarde betaalbaar aan de Bank. Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 24, tweede lid (ii), dienen verzoeken tot betaling op dergelijke in convertibele valuta betaalbare promessen of schuldbrieven over redelijke tijdvakken een gelijk percentage te betreffen van al die promessen en schuldbrieven.   
4.  Elke betaling door een lid in diens eigen valuta gedaan ingevolge het tweede lid, letter (b), van dit artikel beloopt een zodanig bedrag als de Bank, na het Internationale Monetaire Fonds naar goeddunken te hebben geraadpleegd en met gebruikmaking van de door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds eventueel vastgestelde pari-waarde, acht gelijkwaardig te zijn aan de volledige waarde van het gedeele van de inschrijving dat wordt betaald, uitgedrukt in dollars. De aanvankelijke betaling beloopt een bedrag dat het lid op grond van deze bepalingen juist acht, doch wordt op zodanige wijze aangepast als de Bank nodig oordeelt ten einde de volledige tegenwaarde in dollars van die betaling te vormen, en wel binnen 90 dagen na datum waarop die betaling was verschuldigd.   
5.  Betaling van het bedrag waarvoor is ingeschreven op het niet volgestorte gedeelte van het kapitaal van de Bank kan slechts worden gevorderd indien en voor zover de Bank dit nodig heeft om te voldoen aan haar verplichtingen aangegaan ingevolge de alinea's (ii) en (iv) van artikel 11, uit hoofde van het lenen van fondsen voor toevoeging aan haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen of van ten laste van die middelen komende garanties.   
6.  Indien de in lid 5 van dit artikel vermelde storting wordt gevorderd, kan deze naar keuze van het lid geschieden in goud, convertibele valuta, of in de valuta die benodigd is om te voldoen aan de verplichtingen van de Bank, die aanleiding zijn tot het verzoek tot storting. Verzoeken tot storting op niet betaalde inschrijvingen dienen een gelijk percentage van alle niet volgestorte aandelen te betreffen.   
7.  De Bank bepaalt de plaats voor betalingen ingevolge dit artikel, met dien verstande dat tot het tijdstip van de oprichtingsvergadering van haar Raad van Bestuur de betaling van de eerste termijn, genoemd in het eerste lid van dit artikel dient te geschieden aan de Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Azië en het Verre Oosten van de Verenigde Naties, als trustee van de Bank.

(iv) door als eerste dan wel als tweede verbondene, geheel of ten dele, leningen bestemd voor economische ontwikkeling waarin door de Bank wordt deelgenomen, te garanderen.    

### Artikel  12  

####Beperkingen ten aanzien van gewone werkzaamheden

1.  Het totale uitstaande bedrag aan leningen, beleggingen in aandelen en garanties, die door de Bank zijn verstrekt of gedaan in het kader van haar gewone werkzaamheden, mag nooit groter zijn dan het totale bedrag van haar onaangetaste geplaatste kapitaal, waarbij de reserves en de winst zijn begrepen in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, doch met uitzondering van de bijzondere reserve voorzien in artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst en andere reserves die niet beschikbaar zijn voor gewone werkzaamheden.

3.  Met betrekking tot fondsen die zijn belegd in aandelenkapitaal uit de gewone kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank mag het in totaal belegde bedrag niet meer bedragen dan 10% van het totale bedrag van het onaangetaste volgestorte kapitaal van de Bank dat op een bepaald tijdstip werkelijk is betaald, vermeerderd met de reserves en de winst begrepen in haar gewone kapitaalmiddelen, met uitzondering van de in artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst voorziene bijzondere reserve.

### Artikel  13

(i) door de leningnemer andere valuta's te verschaffen dan de valuta van het lid op welks grondgebied het desbetreffende project moet worden uitgevoerd (deze laatste valuta hierna te noemen „lokale valuta”), die nodig zijn om de deviezenkosten van dat project te dekken;  

(ii) door gelden ter beschikking te stellen ten einde lokale uitgaven voor het desbetreffende project te dekken, indien haar dit mogelijk is door lokale valuta te verstrekken zonder haar bezit aan goud of convertibele valuta's aan te tasten. In bijzondere gevallen, wanneer naar de mening van de Bank het project bovenmatige schade of spanning op de betalingsbalans van het lid op welks grondgebied het project moet worden uitgevoerd veroorzaakt of waarschijnlijk zal veroorzaken, kan de door de Bank gegeven financiering tot dekking van lokale uitgaven worden verschaft in andere valuta's dan die van dat lid; in die gevallen mag het bedrag van de door de Bank voor deze financiering ter beschikking gestelde fondsen niet hoger zijn dan een redelijk gedeelte van de totale door de leningnemer gemaakte lokale kosten.    

### Artikel  14  

####Beginselen welke bij de werkzaamheden in acht dienen te worden genomen

De Bank laat zich bij de uitvoering van haar werkzaamheden door de volgende beginselen leiden: 

(i) de werkzaamheden van de Bank bestaan voornamelijk in het financieren van specifieke projecten, met inbegrip van die welke deel uitmaken van een nationaal, semi-regionaal of regionaal ontwikkelingsprogramma. Zij kunnen echter mede omvatten leningen aan of garanties van leningen verstrekt aan nationale ontwikkelingsbanken of andere daarvoor in aanmerking komende lichamen, zodat deze laatste specifieke ontwikkelingsprojecten kunnen financieren waarvan de individuele financieringsbehoeften naar het oordeel van de Bank niet groot genoeg zijn om rechtstreeks toezicht door de Bank te rechtvaardigen;  

(ii) bij het kiezen van geschikte projecten laat de Bank zich steeds leiden door het bepaalde in artikel 2, onder (ii), van deze Overeenkomst;  

(iii) de Bank financiert geen ondernemingen op het grondgebied van een lid, indien dat lid tegen die financiering bezwaar maakt;  

(iv) alvorens een lening wordt toegestaan dient de aanvrager een behoorlijk gefundeerd leningsvoorstel te hebben ingediend en dient de President van de Bank aan het College van Bewindvoerders een schriftelijk rapport betreffende het voorstel te hebben voorgelegd te zamen met zijn aanbevelingen, op basis van een door zijn staf verricht onderzoek;  

(v) bij het beoordelen van een aanvraag voor een lening of garantie overweegt de Bank terdege de mogelijkheid voor de leningnemer elders fondsen of faciliteiten te verkrijgen op voorwaarden die de Bank voor de ontvanger redelijk acht, daarbij rekening houdende met alle in het geding zijnde factoren;  

(vi) bij het verstrekken of garanderen van een lening overweegt de Bank terdege de kansen dat de leningnemer en degene die zich eventueel voor hem garant stelt, bij machte zullen zijn hun verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit de overeenkomst van lening na te komen;  

(vii) bij het verstrekken of garanderen van een lening dienen de rentevoet, de andere kosten en de regeling voor terugbetaling van de hoofdsom zodanig te zijn dat deze, naar het oordeel van de Bank, met de desbetreffende lening in overeenstemming zijn;  

(viii) bij het garanderen van een lening die is verstrekt door andere investeerders, of het garanderen van de verkoop van effecten, ontvangt de Bank een passende vergoeding voor het risico dat zij loopt;  

(ix) de opbrengst van leningen, investeringen of andere financiering verstrekt of verricht in het kader van de gewone werkzaamheden van de Bank of met behulp van door de Bank ingevolge artikel 19, eerste lid, onder (i), ingestelde Bijzondere Fondsen, wordt alleen gebruikt voor aanschaffing in lid-staten van goederen en diensten die zijn geproduceerd in lid-staten, behalve indien het College van Bewindvoerders met ten minste twee derde van het totale aantal door zijn leden uit te brengen stemmen besluit aanschaffing van goederen en diensten in staten niet zijnde lid-staten, of aanschaffing van goederen en diensten voortgebracht in staten niet zijnde lid-staten, toe te staan onder bijzondere omstandigheden welke die aanschaffing rechtvaardigen, bijvoorbeeld indien het een staat niet zijnde een lid-staat betreft die aan de Bank een aanzienlijk bedrag voor financieringsdoeleinden heeft verstrekt;  

(x) in geval van een rechtstreeks door de Bank verstrekte lening zal de leningnemer alleen dan toestemming van de Bank krijgen voor het opnemen van gelden, indien deze dienen tot dekking van in verband met het project gedane werkelijke uitgaven;  

(xi) de Bank neemt de nodige maatregelen om te verzekeren dat het bedrag van een lening die is verstrekt of gegarandeerd door de Bank, of waarin door de Bank wordt deelgenomen alleen wordt gebruikt voor de doeleinden waarvoor de lening werd verstrekt waarbij zij ruimte laat voor overwegingen van zuinigheid en doelmatigheid;  

(xii) de Bank beziet terdege de wenselijkheid van het vermijden dat een onevenredig bedrag van haar middelen wordt gebruikt ten gunste van een bepaald lid;  

(xiii) de Bank tracht een verantwoorde spreiding in haar investeringen in aandelenkapitaal te handhaven; zij aanvaardt geen verantwoordelijkheid voor het beheer van een lichaam of onderneming waarin zij heeft geïnvesteerd, tenzij zulks nodig is om haar investering te beschermen; en  

(xiv) de Bank laat zich bij haar werkzaamheden leiden door beginselen van gezond bankbeleid.    

### Artikel  15  

####Voorwaarden voor rechtstreekse leningen en garanties

1.  In geval van rechtstreekse leningen die door de Bank worden verstrekt of waarin door de Bank wordt deelgenomen, of van leningen die door de Bank worden gegarandeerd, worden in het desbetreffende contract, in overeenstemming met de beginselen voor de werkzaamheden, uiteengezet in artikel 14 van deze Overeenkomst, en behoudens de andere bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, de voorwaarden vastgesteld voor de desbetreffende lening of garantie, met inbegrip van de voorwaarden betreffende de betaling van hoofdsom, rente en andere kosten, vervaldagen en betaaldata wat betreft de lening, onderscheidenlijk de vergoedingen en andere kosten wat betreft de garantie. In het bijzonder wordt in het contract bepaald dat, behoudens het bepaalde in het derde lid van dit artikel, alle betalingen aan de Bank op grond van het contract zullen worden gedaan in de geleende valuta, tenzij, ingeval een rechtstreekse lening wordt verstrekt of gegarandeerd als deel van bijzondere werkzaamheden met fondsen verschaft krachtens artikel 19, eerste lid, onder (ii), de regels en voorschriften van de Bank anders bepalen. Garanties van de Bank houden voorts in dat de Bank haar aansprakelijkheid met betrekking tot rente kan beëindigen indien, bij in gebreke blijven van de leningnemer en eventuele garant, de Bank aanbiedt de gegarandeerde obligaties of andere verplichtingen te kopen, a pari, vermeerderd met de bijkomende interest, tot een op in het aanbod genoemde datum.   
2.  Indien de ontvanger van leningen of garanties van leningen zelf geen lid is, kan de Bank, indien zij zulks raadzaam oordeelt, eisen dat het lid op welks grondgebied het desbetreffende project moet worden uitgevoerd, of een openbaar orgaan dat of instantie van dat lid die aanvaardbaar is voor de Bank, de terugbetaling garanderen van de hoofdsom en de betaling van rente en andere kosten op de lening, overeenkomstig de daaraan verbonden voorwaarden.   
3.  Het leen- of garantiecontract vermeldt uitdrukkelijk de valuta waarin alle betalingen aan de Bank die met dit contract verband houden, worden gedaan. Naar keuze van de leningnemer echter mogen zulke betalingen altijd worden verricht in goud of in convertibele valuta.   

### Artikel  16  

####Provisie en vergoedingen

1.  De Bank berekent behalve rente provisie op rechtstreekse leningen die zij verstrekt of waarin zij deelneemt als onderdeel van haar gewone werkzaamheden. Deze periodiek betaalbare provisie wordt berekend over het bedrag dat uitstaat op elke lening of deelneming en wel op basis van ten minste één procent per jaar, tenzij de Bank na de eerste vijf jaren van haar werkzaamheden besluit dit minimumpercentage te verminderen, hetgeen dient te geschieden met een twee derde meerderheid van haar leden, die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen.   
2.  Bij het garanderen van een lening als deel van haar gewone werkzaamheden berekent de Bank een periodiek over het uitstaande bedrag van de lening te betalen garantievergoeding waarvan de hoogte door het College van Bewindvoerders wordt vastgesteld.   
3.  Andere kosten van de Bank verband houdende met haar gewone werkzaamheden, alsmede provisies, vergoedingen of andere kosten die met haar bijzondere werkzaamheden verband houden, worden door het College van Bewindvoerders vastgesteld.   

### Artikel  17  

####Bijzondere reserve

Het bedrag van de door de Bank ingevolge artikel 16 van deze Overeenkomst ontvangen provisie en garantievergoedingen wordt op een bijzondere reserverekening geboekt, die beschikbaar wordt gehouden om verplichtingen van de Bank overeenkomstig artikel 18 van deze Overeenkomst na te komen. Het College van Bewindvoerders bepaalt in welke liquide vorm de bijzondere reserve zal worden aangehouden.  

### Artikel  18  

####Wijzen waarop de Bank haar verplichtingen nakomt

1.  In geval van in gebreke blijven der debiteuren ten aanzien van leningen die door de Bank zijn verstrekt of gegarandeerd, of waarin de Bank heeft deelgenomen in het kader van haar gewone werkzaamheden, neemt de Bank de haar daartoe als aangewezen voorkomende maatregelen met betrekking tot wijziging van de voorwaarden van de lening, met uitzondering van de valuta waarin terugbetaling moet plaatsvinden.   
2.  Betalingen ter nakoming van de verplichtingen van de Bank ten aanzien van leningen of garanties krachtens artikel 11, alinea's (ii) en (iv), ten laste komende van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen, worden ten laste gebracht van: 

(i) ten eerste de bijzondere reserve, voorzien in artikel 17;  

(ii) vervolgens, voor zover nodig en naar goeddunken van de Bank, de andere reserves, de winst en het kapitaal dat de Bank ter beschikking staat.     
3.  Steeds wanneer dit nodig is om de contractuele betalingen van rente., andere lasten of aflossing op de door de Bank in het kader van haar gewone werkzaamheden opgenomen leningen te betalen of haar verplichtingen na te komen met betrekking tot overeenkomstige betalingen ten aanzien van leningen die door de Bank zijn gegarandeerd, en die ten laste komen van de gewone kapitaalmiddelen van de Bank, kan de Bank krachtens artikel 6, leden 6 en 7, van deze Overeenkomst betaling vorderen van een dienovereenkomstig deel van het niet gevorderde, geplaatste, niet volgestorte kapitaal.   
4.  In geval van in gebreke blijven der debiteuren ten aanzien van een lening die door de Bank als deel van haar gewone werkzaamheden is verstrekt uit geleende fondsen of is gegarandeerd, kan de Bank, indien zij van mening is dat betaling lange tijd kan uitblijven, betaling vorderen van een extra bedrag van dat niet volgestorte kapitaal, dat echter in een bepaald jaar niet meer dan één procent van het totaal der inschrijvingen van de leden op dat kapitaal mag bedragen, ten einde: 

(i) vóór de vervaldag over te gaan tot aflossing of de verplichting van de Bank op andere wijze na te komen ten aanzien van het geheel of een gedeelte van de uitstaande hoofdsom van enige door haar gegarandeerde lening, ten opzichte waarvan de schuldenaar in gebreke is; en  

(ii) de verplichting van de Bank af te kopen of op andere wijze na te komen, voor het geheel of een gedeelte van de door haarzelf opgenomen leningen.     
5.  Indien ingevolge de leden 3 en 4 van dit artikel storting van het gehele geplaatste niet volgestorte kapitaal van de Bank wordt gevorderd, kan de Bank, indien dit noodzakelijk is voor de in het derde lid van dit artikel aangegeven doeleinden, de valuta van een lid gebruiken of omwisselen zonder beperking, met inbegrip van enige beperking opgelegd ingevolge artikel 24, tweede lid (i) en (ii).   

### Artikel  19  

####Bijzondere Fondsen

1.  De Bank kan: 

(i) met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders, die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen, een bedrag ter grootte van hoogstens 10 (tien) procent van zowel het gedeelte van het onaangetast volgestorte kapitaal van de Bank dat door leden is betaald ingevolge artikel 6, tweede lid, letter (a), alsook van het gedeelte daarvan dat is betaald ingevolge artikel 6, tweede, lid, letter (b), op een afzonderlijke rekening boeken en daarmee een of meer Bijzondere Fondsen instellen;  

(ii) het beheer op zich nemen van Bijzondere Fondsen waarvan de bedoeling is dat zij bijdragen tot de verwezenlijking van de doelstelling van de Bank en die verband houden met haar taken.     
2.  Bijzondere Fondsen die door de Bank zijn ingesteld ingevolge het eerste lid (i) van dit artikel, kunnen worden gebruikt om leningen te garanderen of te verstrekken die uit het oogpunt van ontwikkeling hoge prioriteit hebben, die langere looptijden hebben, waarbij de eerste terugbetaling eerst later behoeft te geschieden en met lagere rentepercentages dan die welke zijn vastgesteld door de Bank voor haar gewone werkzaamheden. Deze Fondsen mogen ook worden gebruikt op andere door de Bank bij het instellen van die Fondsen te bepalen voorwaarden die niet in strijd zijn met de toepasselijke bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, noch met het karakter van deze Fondsen als revolverende fondsen.   
3.  Bijzondere Fondsen die door de Bank zijn aanvaard ingevolge het bepaalde in het eerste lid (ii) van dit artikel kunnen worden gebruikt op wijzen en op voorwaarden die niet strijdig zijn met het doel van de Bank en met de overeenkomst met betrekking tot deze Fondsen.   
4.  De aan het instellen, het beheer en het gebruik van elk Bijzonder Fonds noodzakelijk verbonden bijzondere regels en voorschriften worden door de Bank vastgesteld. Die regels en voorschriften mogen niet in strijd zijn met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, met uitzondering van de bepalingen die uitdrukkelijk alleen van toepassing zijn op de gewone werkzaamheden van de Bank.   

### Artikel  20

3.  De Raad van Bestuur kan volgens een nader te bepalen regeling een procedure vaststellen, waarbij het College van Bewindvoerders, wanneer het dit raadzaam acht, een beslissing van de Bestuurders ten aanzien van een bepaald vraagstuk kan verkrijgen zonder een vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur bijeen te roepen.

### Artikel  30  

####College van Bewindvoerders: samenstelling

1.  

(i) Het College van Bewindvoerders bestaat uit 10 (tien) leden leden die geen leden van de Raad van Bestuur zijn, en waarvan er: 

(a) 7 (zeven) worden gekozen door de leden van de Raad van Bestuur die de regionale leden vertegenwoordigen, en  

(b) 3 (drie) door de leden van de Raad van Bestuur, die de niet-regionale leden vertegenwoordigen.   Bewindvoerders dienen personen te zijn die in hoge mate competent zijn in economische en financiële zaken; zij worden gekozen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in Bijlage B bij deze Overeenkomst,  

(ii) Op de tweede jaarvergadering van de Raad van Bestuur na de oprichtingsvergadering dient de Raad van Bestuur de omvang en samenstelling van het College van Bewindvoerders te herzien en het aantal Bewindvoerders naar goeddunken te vergroten, waarbij bijzondere aandacht wordt geschonken aan de wenselijkheid de vertegenwoordiging van de kleinere, minder ontwikkelde lid-staten in het College van Bewindvoerders te vergroten, rekening houdend met de omstandigheden op dat moment. Besluiten ingevolge dit lid worden genomen met een meerderheid der stemmen van het totale aantal leden van de Raad van Bestuur die ten minste twee derde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen.     
2.  Iedere Bewindvoerder wijst een plaatsvervanger aan met volledige bevoegdheid voor hem op te treden, wanneer hij niet aanwezig is. De Bewindvoerders en hun plaatsvervangers dienen onderdanen van lid-staten te zijn. Twee of meer Bewindvoerders mogen niet dezelfde nationaliteit hebben, noch mogen twee of meer plaatsvervangers dezelfde nationaliteit hebben. Een plaatsvervanger mag deelnemen aan vergaderingen van het College, doch mag alleen zijn stem uitbrengen wanneer hij optreedt in de plaats van zijn principaal.   
3.  Bewindvoerders oefenen hun functie uit gedurende een tijdvak van 2 (twee) jaar en kunnen worden herkozen. Zij blijven in functie totdat hun opvolger is gekozen en benoemd. Indien de functie van een Bewindvoerder meer dan 180 (honderdtachtig) dagen voor het einde van zijn ambtsperiode openvalt, wordt door de Bestuurders die de vorige Bewindvoerder hebben gekozen, overeenkomstig Bijlage B van deze Overeenkomst een opvolger gekozen voor het resterende deel van de ambtsperiode. Voor deze verkiezing is een meerderheid van de door deze Bestuurders uitgebrachte stemmen nodig. Indien de functie van een Bewindvoerder 180 (honderdtachtig) dagen of minder voor het einde van zijn ambtsperiode openvalt, kan op gelijke wijze door de Bestuurders die de vorige Bewindvoerder hebben gekozen een opvolger worden gekozen voor het resterende deel van de ambtsperiode, voor welke verkiezing een meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen nodig is. Zolang de functie onvervuld blijft, oefent de plaatsvervanger van de vorige Bewindvoerder de rechten van de laatste uit, behalve het recht een plaatsvervanger te benoemen.   

### Artikel  31  

####College van Bewindvoerders: bevoegdheden

Het College van Bewindvoerders is verantwoordelijk voor de leiding van de algemene werkzaamheden van de Bank en dient daartoe, naast de bevoegdheden die het in deze Overeenkomst uitdrukkelijk zijn toegewezen, alle bevoegdheden uit te oefenen die door de Raad van Bestuur daaraan zijn overgedragen, en in het bijzonder

3.  De Raad van Bestuur stelt regels vast volgens welke een lid, indien er geen Bewindvoerder van zijn nationaliteit is, iedere vergadering van het College van Bewindvoerders door een vertegenwoordiger kan doen bijwonen, zij het zonder stemrecht, wanneer wordt beraadslaagd over een vraagstuk waarbij dat lid ten nauwste is betrokken.   

### Artikel  33  

####Stemrecht

1.  Het totale aantal stemmen van ieder lid wordt gevormd door de som van zijn basisstemmen en zijn proportionele stemmen.

(ii) Het aantal proportionele stemmen van ieder lid is gelijk aan het aantal aandelen in het aandelenkapitaal van de Bank, waarvan dat lid houder is.     
2.  Bij stemming in de Raad van Bestuur is elk der leden van de Raad van Bestuur gerechtigd de stemmen uit te brengen van het lid dat hij vertegenwoordigt. Voor zover in deze Overeenkomst niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, worden alle besluiten van de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van de ter vergadering uitgebrachte stemmen genomen.   
3.  Bij stemming in het College van Bewindvoerders is iedere bewindvoerder gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen, dat hij bij zijn verkiezing op zich heeft verenigd; deze stemmen behoeven niet als een eenheid te worden uitgebracht. Voor zover in deze Overeenkomst niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, worden alle besluiten van het College van Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van de ter vergadering uitgebrachte stemmen genomen.   

### Artikel  34

Deze dient de nationaliteit van een regionale lid-staat te bezitten. De President mag tijdens het bekleden van zijn functie geen Bestuurder, Bewindvoerder, of plaatsvervanger van een van beiden zijn.

Hij treedt echter af wanneer de Raad van Bestuur zulks beslist met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders die ten minste twee derde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen. Indien door enige oorzaak de functie van President meer dan 180 (honderdtachtig) dagen voor het einde van zijn ambtstermijn openvalt, wordt door de Raad van Bestuur een opvolger voor het resterende gedeelte van de termijn gekozen, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel.

6.  Bij het aanstellen van leidinggevend en ander personeel schenkt de President, rekening houdend met het primaire belang van de waarborging van een zo hoog mogelijk peil van doelmatigheid en technische bekwaamheid, de nodige aandacht aan het aantrekken van personeel op een zo breed mogelijke regionaal-geografische basis.   

### Artikel  35  

####Vice-President(en)

1.  De Raad van Bewindvoerders benoemt een of meer Vice-Presidenten op aanbeveling van de President. Het College van Bewindvoerders bepaalt de ambtstermijn van de Vice-President, diens bevoegdheden en zijn taak bij het besturen van de Bank. Bij afwezigheid of onvermogen van de President oefent de Vice-President of, indien er meer dan een is, de hoogste Vice-President in rang de bevoegdheden van de President uit, en vervult hij diens taak.   
2.  Vice-Presidenten mogen deelnemen aan vergaderingen van het College van Bewindvoerders, doch hebben op deze vergaderingen geen stemrecht, zij het dan dat de Vice-President of de in rang hoogste Vice-President al naar gelang het geval is, een beslissende stem uitbrengt wanneer hij optreedt in de plaats van de President.

De Bank, haar President, Vice-President(en), leidinggevend personeel en ander personeel dienen zich niet in de politieke aangelegenheden van een lid te mengen, noch zich bij hun beslissingen door het politieke karakter van het betrokken lid te laten beïnvloeden. Bij het nemen van hun beslissingen mogen zij zich uitsluitend door economische overwegingen laten leiden. Deze overwegingen worden onpartijdig tegen elkaar afgewogen, ten einde zodoende de doeleinden en de functies van de Bank te verwezenlijken.   
3.  De President, Vice-Presidenten, leidinggevend personeel en ander personeel van de Bank staan bij het uitoefenen van hun functies uitsluitend in dienst van de Bank en stellen hun diensten aan geen enkele andere autoriteit ter beschikking.

### Artikel  40  

####Verdeling van het netto-inkomen

1.  De Raad van Bestuur stelt jaarlijks vast welk deel van het nettoinkomen van de Bank, inclusief het netto-inkomen van de Bijzondere Fondsen, na voorziening van de reserves, wordt toegevoegd aan het surplus en welk deel eventueel wordt uitgekeerd aan de leden.

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Opzegging van het lidmaatschap en schorsing van leden

*Tijdelijke opschorting van beëindiging van de werkzaamheden van de Bank*   

### Artikel  41  

####Opzegging

1.  Ieder lid kan te allen tijde uit de Bank treden door middel van een aan het hoofdkantoor van de Bank gerichte schriftelijke kennisgeving van opzegging.   
2.  De uittreding van een lid gaat in en het lidmaatschap eindigt op de datum, vermeld in de kennisgeving, doch in geen geval eerder dan 6 (zes) maanden na het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving door de Bank is ontvangen. Het lid kan evenwel, zolang de opzegging niet definitief van kracht is geworden, de Bank, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, ervan verwittigen dat het zijn voorgenomen opzegging intrekt.   
3.  Een uittredend lid blijft verantwoordelijk voor alle directe en indirecte verplichtingen tegenover de Bank, waaraan het was gebonden op het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving van opzegging werd ontvangen. Indien de opzegging definitief van kracht wordt, is het lid niet verantwoordelijk voor verplichtingen, voortvloeiende uit werkzaamheden van de Bank die zijn verricht na het tijdstip waarop de kennisgeving van opzegging door de Bank werd ontvangen.   

### Artikel  42  

####Schorsing van de leden

1.  Indien een lid zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Bank niet nakomt, kan de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen, dat lid schorsen.   
2.  Een op deze wijze geschorst lid houdt een jaar na de datum van zijn schorsing automatisch op lid te zijn, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur in de loop van dit tijdvak met een zelfde meerderheid als nodig was voor de schorsing besluit het lid in ere te herstellen.   
3.  Zolang de schorsing duurt is een lid niet bevoegd enig recht ingevolge deze Overeenkomst uit te oefenen, behalve het recht van opzegging, doch het blijft gebonden aan al zijn verplichtingen.   

### Artikel  43  

####Vereffening van rekeningen

1.  Na het tijdstip waarop een staat ophoudt lid te zijn., blijft hij verantwoordelijk voor zijn directe en zijn indirecte verplichtingen jegens de Bank, zolang enig deel van de leningen en garanties die werden verstrekt voordat hij ophield lid te zijn, nog uitstaat; doch hij wordt niet betrokken bij verplichtingen ten aanzien van leningen en garanties die daarna door de Bank worden verstrekt, noch deelt hij in de winsten of de onkosten van de Bank.   
2.  Op het tijdstip waarop een staat ophoudt lid te zijn, treft de Bank als onderdeel van de vereffening van de rekeningen met die staat maatregelen voor de terugkoop van de aandelen van die staat door de Bank, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het derde en het vierde lid van dit artikel. Voor dit doel is de prijs waarvoor de aandelen worden teruggekocht, gelijk aan de waarde die is aangegeven in de boeken de Bank, op het tijdstip dat de staat ophoudt lid te zijn.   
3.  De betaling van aandelen die krachtens dit artikel door de Bank zijn teruggekocht is aan de volgende voorwaarden gebonden. 

(i) Bedragen die aan de desbetreffende staat voor zijn aandelen verschuldigd zijn worden ingehouden, zolang de staat, zijn centrale bank of een van zijn instanties, diensten of politieke onderafdelingen verantwoordelijk blijft als leningnemer of jegens de Bank garant blijft: zulke bedragen kunnen, ter keuze van de Bank, op de vervaldag voor iedere verplichting van die aard worden aangewezen. Er wordt geen bedrag ingehoude uit hoofde van de indirecte verplichting van de staat, voortspruitende uit intekening door die staat op aandelen ingevolge artikel 6, vijfde lid, van deze Overeenkomst. In geen geval wordt een bedrag dat aan een lid voor zijn aandelen is verschuldigd, eerder uitbetaald dan zes maanden na de datum waarop de staat heeft opgehouden lid te zijn.  

(ii) Betalingen voor aandelen kunnen van tijd tot tijd worden gedaan tegen inlevering door de desbetreffende staat van de daarbij behorende aandelen-certificaten in de omvang waarmede het bedrag van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde terugkoopprijs het totaal der verplichtingen ten aanzien van de leningen en garanties bedoeld in alinea (i) van dit lid te boven gaat, totdat het gewezen lid het volle bedrag van de terugkoopprijs heeft ontvangen.  

(iii) Betalingen dienen te geschieden in door de Bank te bepalen beschikbare valuta, rekening houdend met haar financiële positie.  

(iv) Indien door de Bank verliezen worden geleden op enige garantie of lening die op de datum waarop de staat ophield lid te zijn uitstond en het bedrag van deze verliezen het totaal der met het oog op verliezen gevormde reserve op die datum te boven gaat, betaalt de desbetreffende staat desgevraagd het bedrag terug waarmede de terugkoopprijs van haar aandelen verminderd zou zijn indien met de verliezen rekening zou zijn gehouden bij de vaststelling van de terugkoopprijs. Bovendien blijft het gewezen lid aansprakelijk voor iedere oproep ter voldoening van niet gestorte inschrijvingen ingevolge artikel 6, vijfde lid, van deze Overeenkomst, tot hetzelfde bedrag waarvoor het verplicht zou zijn op te komen indien het kapitaalverlies en de oproep zouden hebben plaatsgevonden op het ogenblik dat de terugkoopprijs van zijn aandelen werd vastgesteld.     
4.  Indien de Bank in overeenstemming met artikel 45 van deze Overeenkomst haar werkzaamheden staakt binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop een staat ophoudt lid te zijn, worden alle rechten van de desbetreffende staat vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 45 tot en met 47 van deze Overeenkomst. Zulk een staat wordt ter zake van deze bepalingen als een lid beschouwd, doch heeft geen stemrecht.   

### Artikel  44  

####Tijdelijke staking der werkzaamheden

In geval van onvoorziene omstandigheden kan de Raad van Bewindvoerders tijdelijk de werkzaamheden ten aanzien van nieuwe leningen en garanties opschorten, in afwachting van een gelegenheid tot verder overleg en handelen door de Raad van Bestuur.  

### Artikel  45  

####Beëindiging der werkzaamheden

1.  De Bank kan bij beslissing van de Raad van Bestuur, genomen met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen, haar werkzaamheden beëindigen.   
2.  Na haar werkzaamheden aldus te hebben beëindigd, houdt de Bank op staande voet op met alle werkzaamheden, behalve die welke nodig zijn voor het naar behoren te gelde maken, het in stand houden en het beschermen van haar activa en het vereffenen van haar schulden.   

### Artikel  46  

####Verplichtingen van leden en betaling van vorderingen

1.  Ingeval van beëindiging van de werkzaamheden van de Bank blijft de verplichting van alle leden uit hoofde van niet volgestorte inschrijvingen op het aandelenkapitaal van de Bank en ten aanzien van de waardevermindering van hun valuta's bestaan, totdat alle vorderingen der crediteuren, met inbegrip van alle voorwaardelijke vorderingen, zijn voldaan.   
2.  Alle crediteuren die directe vorderingen hebben, worden eerst betaald uit de activa der Bank en vervolgens uit de aan de Bank verrichte betalingen wegens niet betaalde of niet volgestorte inschrijvingen. Voordat betalingen aan crediteuren, die directe vorderingen hebben, plaats vinden, treft het College van Bewindvoerders de naar zijn mening nodige maatregelen ter verzekering van een verdeling pro rata onder de houders van directe en voorwaardelijke vorderingen.   

### Artikel  47  

####Verdeling der activa

1.  Er vindt geen verdeling van activa aan de leden uit hoofde van hun inschrijving op het aandelenkapitaal plaats voordat aan alle verplichtingen tegenover de crediteuren is voldaan of deze verplichtingen zijn geregeld. Bovendien dient deze verdeling te worden goedgekeurd door de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van twee derde van het totale aantal Bestuurders die ten minste drie vierde van het totale aantal stemmen van de leden vertegenwoordigen.   
2.  De verdeling van de activa van de Bank onder de leden dient te geschieden in verhouding tot de deelneming van elk der leden in het aandelenkapitaal en wordt van kracht op het tijdstip en onder de voorwaarden die de Bank redelijk en billijk acht. Geen enkel lid is gerechtigd zijn aandeel in een verdeling van de activa te ontvangen, voordat het al zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Bank is nagekomen.   
3.  Elk lid dat activa ontvangt die ingevolge dit artikel worden verdeeld, geniet ten aanzien van deze activa dezelfde rechten als de Bank vóór de verdeling daarvan genoot.
