####Instelling van de Conferentie

Hierbij wordt een Europese Conferentie inzake Moleculaire Biologie, hierna te noemen „de Conferentie”, ingesteld.  

### Artikel  II  

####Doelstellingen

1.  De Conferentie brengt tussen Europese Staten samenwerking tot stand bij het fundamenteel wetenschappelijk onderzoek zowel op het gebied van de moleculaire biologie als op andere daarmede nauw verband houdende terreinen van onderzoek.   
2.  Het onder verantwoordelijkheid van de Conferentie uit te voeren Algemene Programma omvat in de eerste plaats: 

(a) het voorzien in de behoefte aan beurzen voor opleiding, onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek;  

(b) het verlenen van bijstand aan universiteiten en andere instellingen van hoger onderwijs die gasthoogleraren willen ontvangen;
