### Artikel  I  

####Oprichting van het Laboratorium

1.  Hierbij wordt een Europees Laboratorium voor Moleculaire Biologie opgericht (hierna te noemen „het Laboratorium”) als een intergouvernementele instelling.   
2.  De zetel van het Laboratorium is gevestigd te Heidelberg in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland.   

### Artikel  II  

####Doeleinden en middelen

1.  Het Laboratorium bevordert de samenwerking tussen de Europese Staten in het fundamenteel wetenschappelijk onderzoek, in de ontwikkeling van een geavanceerd instrumentarium en in onderwijs op hoog niveau in de moleculaire biologie alsook op andere daarmede wezenlijk verband houdende terreinen van onderzoek en richt hiertoe zijn activiteiten op werk dat gewoonlijk niet of niet licht wordt verricht in nationale instellingen. De resultaten van het experimentele en theoretische werk van het Laboratorium worden gepubliceerd of op andere wijze algemeen toegankelijk gemaakt.   
2.  Ten einde deze doeleinden te verwezenlijken voert het Laboratorium een programma uit dat voorziet in: 

a. de toepassing van moleculaire begrippen en methoden bij het onderzoek van fundamentele biologische processen;  

b. de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van het noodzakelijke instrumentarium en de vereiste technologie;  

c. arbeidsruimten en onderzoeksfaciliteiten voor bezoekende wetenschapsmensen;  

d. opleiding en onderwijs op hoog niveau.     
3.  Het Laboratorium kan de voor zijn programma noodzakelijke installaties bouwen en exploiteren. Het Laboratorium omvat: 

a. de uitrusting die voor de uitvoering van het programma door het Laboratorium noodzakelijk is;  

b. de noodzakelijke gebouwen waarin de in letter a hierboven bedoelde uitrusting wordt opgesteld en de diensten voor het beheer van het Laboratorium en voor de uitoefening van zijn andere functies worden ondergebracht.     
4.  Het Laboratorium organiseert en bevordert de internationale samenwerking, in de ruimst mogelijke zin, op de terreinen en binnen het programma van activiteiten omschreven in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel, en in overeenstemming met het Algemene Programma van de ECMB. Deze samenwerking omvat met name het bevorderen van contacten tussen en de uitwisseling van wetenschapsmensen en de verspreiding van kennis. Binnen het kader van zijn doelstellingen streeft het Laboratorium ook naar samenwerking, in de ruimst mogelijke zin, met instellingen voor onderzoek en wel door medewerking en verstrekking van adviezen. Het Laboratorium dient duplicering te vermijden van werk dat reeds in de genoemde instellingen wordt verricht.

b. Wanneer zich een vacature voordoet, kan de Raad de benoeming van de Directeur-Generaal voor een door hem noodzakelijk geachte periode uitstellen. In dat geval stelt hij een persoon aan die optreedt in de plaats van de Directeur-Generaal, waarbij de aldus benoemde persoon de bevoegdheden en verantwoordelijkheden heeft die de Raad bepaalt.     
2.  De Directeur-Generaal is de hoogste uitvoerende functionaris en de wettige vertegenwoordiger van het Laboratorium.   
3.  

a. De Directeur-Generaal legt aan de Raad de volgende stukken voor: 

i. het ontwerp van het globale plan bedoeld in het derde lid, letter b, van artikel VI van deze Overeenkomst;  

ii. de begroting en de voorlopige raming der kosten bedoeld in het derde lid, letters c en d, van artikel VI van deze Overeenkomst;

Personen die niet tot het personeel behoren en die worden uitgenodigd in het Laboratorium te werken, zijn onderworpen aan het gezag van de Directeur-Generaal en aan de door de Raad goedgekeurde algemene voorwaarden.   
6.  Elke Lid-Staat eerbiedigt het uitsluitend internationale karakter van de verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel ten aanzien van het Laboratorium.

### Artikel  VIII  

####Wetenschappelijke Adviescommissie

1.  De Wetenschappelijke Adviescommissie ingesteld overeenkomstig het zevende lid van artikel VI van deze Overeenkomst geeft de Raad advies, met name ten aanzien van voorstellen van de Directeur-Generaal inzake de uitvoering van het programma van het Laboratorium.

####Bijdragen en accountantsonderzoek

1.  Elke Lid-Staat draagt jaarlijks bij in de kapitaalsuitgaven en in de lopende exploitatiekosten van het Laboratorium tot een totaal bedrag aan inwisselbare valuta overeenkomstig een om de drie jaar door de Raad met een twee-derde meerderheid der stemmen van alle Lid-Staten vast te stellen verdeelsleutel, die is gebaseerd op het gemiddelde netto nationale inkomen tegen factorkosten van elk Lid-Staat over de laatste drie voorafgaande kalenderjaren, waarover gegevens beschikbaar zijn.   
2.  De Raad kan met een twee-derde meerderheid der stemmen van alle Lid-Staten besluiten rekening te houden met eventuele bijzondere omstandigheden van een Lid-Staat en zijn bijdragen dienovereenkomstig aan te passen. Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling heeft de uitdrukking „bijzondere omstandigheden” met name betrekking op een toestand waarin het nationale inkomen van een Lid-Staat per hoofd van de bevolking lager is dan een bedrag dat door de Raad met een twee-derde meerderheid van stemmen wordt vastgesteld, of een toestand waarin van een Lid-Staat wordt verlangd dat hij meer dan dertig procent van het totale bedrag bijdraagt dat door de Raad is bepaald overeenkomstig de verdeelsleutel bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.

Het bedrag van deze speciale bijdrage wordt vastgesteld door de Raad met een twee-derde meerderheid der stemmen van alle Lid-Staten.  

b. Alle bijdragen verricht overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder letter a van dit lid worden in mindering gebracht op de bijdragen van de andere Lid-Staten, tenzij de Raad met een twee-derde meerderheid der stemmen van alle Lid-Staten anders beslist.     
4.  Indien, nadat deze Overeenkomst in werking is getreden, een Staat Partij bij de Overeenkomst wordt of ophoudt Partij bij de Overeenkomst te zijn, wordt de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde verdeelsleutel voor de bijdragen gewijzigd. De nieuwe sleutel wordt van kracht met de aanvang van het daaropvolgende boekjaar.   
5.  De Directeur-Generaal deelt de Lid-Staten mede welk bedrag zij als jaarlijkse bijdrage moeten betalen en, met instemming van de Financiële Commissie, op welke tijdstippen zij deze dienen te voldoen.   
6.  De Directeur-Generaal houdt nauwkeurig boek van alle ontvangsten en uitgaven.   
7.  De Raad benoemt accountants voor het controleren van de boeken van het Laboratorium. De accountants leggen de Raad een verslag voor over de jaarrekeningen.   
8.  De Directeur-Generaal verstrekt de accountants alle inlichtingen en verleent alle hulp die zij, voor de uitvoering van hun taak, kunnen nodig hebben.   

### Artikel  XI  

####Juridische status

Het Laboratorium bezit rechtspersoonlijkheid. In het bijzonder heeft het de bevoegdheid overeenkomsten aan te gaan, roerende en onroerende goederen te verwerven en te vervreemden en rechtsgedingen aan te spannen. De Staat waar het Laboratorium is gevestigd sluit met het Laboratorium een overeenkomst inzake de zetel, die door de Raad moet worden goedgekeurd met een twee-derde meerderheid der stemmen van alle Lid-Staten, betreffende de status van het Laboratorium, alsmede de voorrechten en immuniteiten van het Laboratorium en zijn personeel die noodzakelijk zijn voor de verwezenlijking van zijn doeleinden en de uitoefening van zijn functies.

### Artikel  XIII  

####Wijzigingen

1.  Een voorstel van een Lid-Staat tot wijziging van deze Overeenkomst wordt geplaatst op de agenda van de eerstvolgende gewone zitting nadat het voorstel bij de Directeur-Generaal is nedergelegd. Voor de behandeling van een zodanig voorstel kan ook een buitengewone zitting worden bijeengeroepen.   
2.  Wijzigingen van deze Overeenkomst dienen door de Lid-Staten met eenparigheid van stemmen te worden aangenomen. Zij stellen de Zwitserse Bondsraad schriftelijk in kennis van hun aanvaarding.

### Artikel  XIV  

####Opheffing

Het Laboratorium wordt opgeheven indien er op enig tijdstip minder dan drie Lid-Staten zijn. Met inachtneming van eventuele afspraken tussen de Lid-Staten op het tijdstip van de liquidatie is de Staat waar de zetel van het Laboratorium is gevestigd verantwoordelijk voor de liquidatie. Tenzij de Lid-Staten anders beslissen, wordt het overschot tussen de Staten die Lid van het Laboratorium zijn op het tijdstip van de liquidatie verdeeld naar rato van alle door hen verrichte betalingen. In het geval dat er een tekort is, wordt dit door de Lid-Staten aangezuiverd op basis van dezelfde verdeelsleutel als die welke gold bij het vaststellen van hun bijdragen voor het lopende boekjaar.
