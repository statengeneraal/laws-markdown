The German authorities may also submit the statement prior to receipt of such notification.

3.  In cases falling within paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article the military authorities may, to such extent as may be necessary, disarm the person so taken into temporary custody, and may search him and seize any items in his possession which may serve as evidence for the purposes of the investigation of the suspected or alleged offence.   
4.  The military authorities shall, without delay, deliver any person taken into temporary custody in accordance with this Article, together with any weapons or other items so seized, to the nearest German public prosecutor or police officer or judge or to the military authorities of the sending State to whose force or civilian component the person belongs either as a member or as a dependent of such member.

Where an investigation is initiated or an arrest made by a German authority in respect of an act punishable under Article 7 of the Fourth Law Amending the Criminal Law dated 11 June 1957 (Bundesgesetzblatt Teil I, page 597) or under such legislation as may replace that Article in future, the German authorities conducting the investigations shall notify the military authorities of the sending State concerned without delay. The same shall apply if a German authority initiates an investigation or makes an arrest in respect of an act otherwise directed against the security of a sending State or of its force.

They shall take full account of any special request regarding custody made by the competent German authorities.   

### Article  23  

Where a person is arrested in any case referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 21 of the present Agreement, a representative of the sending State concerned shall have access to that person.

Where an offence is solely directed against the security of the Federal Republic, or against any property within the Federal Republic, or against a German or a person present in the Federal territority, and jurisdiction is exercised in the Federal Republic by a court or authority of a sending State, a German representative shall have the right to attend the trial.  

(b) For the purpose of the provisions set forth in sub-paragraph *(a)* of this paragraph 

(i) the expression “property within the Federal Republic” shall not include property belonging either to a force or a civilian component or to a member of a force or of a civilian component or to a dependent;  

(ii) the expression “a person present in the Federal territory” shall not include a member of a force or of a civilian component or a dependent.

2.

(a) except where the law of the sending State requires otherwise, or  

(b) except where, in cases of military exigency or in the interests of justice, the authorities of the sending State intend to hold the trial outside the Federal territory.

2.  Where the trial is held outside the Federal territory the authorities of the sending State shall inform the German authorities of the place and date of the trial. A German representative shall be entitled to be present at the trial, except where his presence is incompatible with the rules of the court of the sending State or with the security requirements of that State, which are not at the same time security requirements of the Federal Republic. The authorities of the sending State shall inform the German authorities of the judgment and of the final outcome of the proceedings.   

### Article  27

(a) Service upon members of a force, of a civilian component, or on dependents of a plaint or other document or court order initiating non-criminal proceedings before a German court or authority shall be made through a liaison agency to be established or designated by each of the sending States. The German courts or authorities may request the liaison agency to ensure service of other documents arising in such proceedings.  

(b) Receipt of an application submitted by a German court or authority for service shall be acknowledged by the liaison agency without delay. Service shall be effective when the document to be served is delivered to the addressee by his unit commander or by a representative of the liaison agency. Notification in writing that service has been effected shall be given without delay to the German court or authority.  

(c) 

(i) If, upon the expiry of a period of twenty-one days from the date of acknowledgement of receipt by the liaison agency, the German court or authority has received neither notification in writing that service has been effected in accordance with sub-paragraph *(b)* of this paragraph nor any communication stating that it has not been possible to effect service, the court or authority shall forward to the liaison agency another copy of the application for service with notice that seven days after receipt by the liaison agency service shall be deemed to have been effected. At the expiry of this seven-day period, service shall be deemed to have been effected.  

(ii) Service shall not, however, be deemed to have been effected if the liaison agency notifies the German court or authority prior to the expiry of the period of twenty-one days or seven days, as the case may be, that it has not been able to effect service. The liaison agency shall inform the German court or authority of the reasons for its inability to do so.

3.  A payment due to a member of a force or a civilian component from his Government shall be subject to attachment, garnishment or other form of execution ordered by a German court or authority only to the extent permitted by the law applicable in the territory of the sending State.   
4.  Where the enforcement of a judgment, decision, order and settlement in non-criminal proceedings of a German court or authority is to take place within an installation of a force, such enforcement shall be effected by a German enforcement officer in the presence of a representative of the force.   

### Article  35  

Where a judgment, decision, order and settlement (vollstreckbarer Titel) of a German court or authority is to be enforced against a debtor to whom a payment is due in respect of employment with a force or civilian component in accordance with the provisions of Article 56 of the present Agreement or in respect of direct deliveries or services to a force or a civilian component, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) Where such a payment is made through a German authority and that authority has been requested by an enforcing agency to make the payment to the judgment creditor instead of to the debtor, that authority shall be entitled to comply with such request within the scope of the provisions of German law.  

(b) 

(i) Where such a payment is not made through a German authority, the authorities of the force or of the civilian component shall, upon request by an enforcing agency and insofar as the law of the sending State concerned permits, deposit with the competent agency out of the sum admitted to be owing to the debtor the sum specified in the request. Such deposit shall operate as a discharge of the force or the civilian component from its obligation to the debtor to the extent of the amount deposited.  

(ii) Insofar as the law of the sending State concerned does not permit the procedure prescribed in item (i) of this sub-paragraph, the authorities of the force or of the civilian component shall take all appropriate measures to assist the enforcing agency in the execution of the judgment, decision, order and settlement in question.      

### Article  36  

1.  Service by German courts and authorities upon members of a force, of a civilian component or on dependents shall not be effected by publication or advertisement.

### Article  37  

1.  

(a) Where a member of a force or of a civilian component is summoned to appear before a German court or authority, the military authorities, unless military exigency requires otherwise, shall secure his attendance provided that such attendance is compulsory under German law.

In the event that the appropriate authority advances considerations against disclosure, the court or authority shall take all steps in its power, including those to which paragraph 2 of this Article relates, to prevent such disclosure, provided no constitutional right of any party to the proceedings is thereby impaired.   
2.  The provisions of Sections 172 to 175 of the German Judicature Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) on the exclusion of the public from hearings in criminal and non-criminal proceedings, and of Section 15 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure on the transfer of criminal proceedings to a court in a different district, shall be applied *mutatis mutandis* in cases before German courts and authorities where there is a threat to the security of a force or of a civilian component.   

### Article  39  

Privileges and immunities of witnesses and experts shall be those accorded by the law of the court or authority before which they appear. The court or authority shall, however, give appropriate consideration to the privileges and immunities which witnesses and experts, if they are members of a force or of a civilian component or dependents, would have before a court of the sending State or, if they do not belong to these categories of persons, would have before a German court.  

### Article  40

### Article  41  

1.  The settlement of claims in respect of damage caused by acts or omissions of a force, a civilian component or their members, or by other occurrences for which a force or a civilian component is legally responsible, shall be governed by the provisions of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the provisions of this Article supplementary thereto.

(b) loss of or damage to property which has been constructed or procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds, to the extent that such loss or damage was caused while the property was at the disposal of a force or a civilian component for its use.     
3.  

(a) The Federal Republic stall waive all its claims against a sending State in respect of loss of, or damage to, property owned by the Federal Republic and made available for the exclusive use of the force or of the civilian component. This shall apply equally if such property is made available for use by the forces of several sending States or is used by the force of one or more sending States jointly with the German Armed Forces. This waiver shall not apply to damage caused wilfully or by gross negligence, nor to damage to the property of the German Federal Railways or German Federal Post.  

(b) The provisions of sub-paragraph (*f*) of paragraph 2 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall not apply to loss of or damage to property owned by the German Federal Railways or the German Federal Post nor to damage to Federal roads.     
4.  The Federal Republic shall relieve the sending States of liability for claims arising from loss of or damage to property owned by a Land, if the loss or damage was caused prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement.   
5.  Each sending State shall waive all its claims against the Federal Republic in respect of loss of or damage to property owned by such sending State and caused by members or employees of the German Armed Forces in the performance of official duties or by the use of vehicles, ships, or aircraft of the German Armed Forces, provided that it is property used by the force or the civilian component of that State and that it is located in the Federal territory. This waiver shall not apply to damage caused wilfully or by gross negligence.   
6.  The provisions of paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and of this Article shall not apply to damage suffered by members of a force or of a civilian component and caused by acts or omissions of other members of the same force or the same civilian component, or by other occurrences for which such force or such civilian component is legally responsible.

8.  The liability of a force or of a civilian component shall not be affected by the fact that such force or civilian component enjoys exemption from German regulations. Where the German Armed Forces enjoy the same exemptions, compensation shall be payable only if and to the extent that compensation is payable for damage caused by the latter.   
9.  

(a) In cases where an occurrence causing damage to a third party and compensable under paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement has also given rise to damage to the sending State concerned, and where the third party is liable to compensate for such damage, the claim of the sending State is to be set off against the claim of the third party.  

(b) The Federal Republic shall, in accordance with administrative agreements, and at the request of a sending State, assert for that State claims against persons resident in the Federal territory and arising out of damage caused there to such State; this shall not apply to contractual claims. Such expenses which the Federal Republic incurs in asserting claims over and above the general costs of administration shall be reimbursed by the sending State.     
10.  In respect of claims concerning damage to accommodation or loss of, or damage to, movables, other than accommodation or movables owned by the Federation or by a Land, which were made available for exclusive use by a force or a civilian component before 5 May 1955, and which are released by the force or the civilian component after the entry into force of the present Agreement, compensation shall be borne by the Federal Republic and the sending State concerned in equal parts.   
11.  

(a) Except in cases where after inquiry of the forces concerned it is not possible to establish to which of them the loss or damage is attributable, the force shall furnish a certificate concerning the questions dealt with in paragraph 8 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement; it shall, at the request of the German authorities, review such certificate if, during investigation of a claim, a German authority or a German court considers that circumstances exist which would lead to an inference different from that contained therein.  

(b) If a difference of opinion remains that cannot be resolved in further discussions between the two parties at higher level, the procedure provided in paragraph 8 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall be followed.  

(c) The German authorities or courts shall make their decisions in conformity with the certificate or the decision of the arbitrator respectively.     
12.  

(a) The provisions of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and of this Article shall apply to those damages which are caused or which are deemed to be caused after the entry into force of the present Agreement.  

(b) Damages which were caused before the entry into force of the present Agreement, or which are deemed to have been caused before that date, shall be dealt with in accordance with the regulations which were until then applicable.

(b) 

(i) Subject to the provisions of item (iv) of this sub-paragraph, the German authorities shall forward to the authorities of a force copies of all applications for permits to photograph (Aufnahmeerlaubnisse) which they intend to grant.  

(ii) Where within ten days after a copy has been received the authorities of the force raise objections on grounds of secrecy or security and where consultations between the German authorities and the authorities of the force are inconclusive, the matter shall be dealt with without delay at a higher level. The German authorities shall not permit aerial photography of installations, equipment, troop dispositions or movements of a force if the authorities of the force state that its security would be endangered thereby.  

(iii) Subject to the provisions of item (iv) of this subparagraph, the German authorities shall, upon request, permit the authorities of a force to examine negatives of aerial photographs, and in agreement with the authorities of the force shall take, with respect to such negatives, any measures necessary to safeguard the secrecy or security of installations, equipment, troop dispositions or movements of the force.  

(iv) The exercise of the rights of a force provided for in items (i) and (iii) of this sub-paragraph shall be limited to the geographical areas defined in administrative agreements to be concluded with the German authorities.    

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (ii) of sub-paragraph *(b)* of this Article, permission to photograph may be granted by the German authorities, after consultation with the authorities of the force referred to in item (iv) of sub-paragraph *(b)* of this Article, where aerial photography for official survey purposes is commissioned by a German authority. In such cases the German authorities shall ensure that the authorities of the force will have first access to negatives and that any measures requested by them to safeguard the secrecy or security of installations, equipment, troop dispositions or movements of a force, are carried out with respect to such negatives.    

### Article  43

2.  The authorities of a force may, after timely notification to the German authorities, make topographic, geodetic, hydrographic or engineering surveys or reconnaissances in the interest of the common defence if special reasons of security or secrecy necessitate this or if the German authorities are unable to carry out such projects to the extent or within the time required. Representatives of the German authorities may be present, unless prohibited by special reasons of secrecy, while any such survey is being made. The German authorities shall, when necessary, use their powers under German law in order to obtain authority for representatives of the force to enter property.   

### Article  44  

1.  In the settlement of disputes arising from contracts concluded by the German authorities for the account of the authorities of a force or of a civilian component there shall at all times be close co-operation between those authorities, whether or not court proceedings are involved. This shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to disputes arising out of work, personnel representation, or social insurance of civilian labour with a force or a civilian component, as well as to disputes which arise from procedures referred to in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 62 of the present Agreement. Details of such co-operation shall be laid down in administrative agreements.   
2.  So far as they relate to court proceedings instituted against the Federal Republic, the agreements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be based on the following principles:

(b) The decision as to whether or not an appeal should be lodged shall be taken only in agreement with the authorities of the force or of the civilian component. Failing agreement, the German authorities shall lodge an appeal if an authority of the force or, where applicable, an authority of the civilian component, at highest level, confirms its essential interest in that action being taken. The authorities of the force or of the civilian component shall not object to the lodging of an appeal if a Federal authority at the highest level confirms its essential interest in that action being taken. To the extent that the reasons underlying the confirmation of the interest referred to in the second and third sentences of this paragraph have not become known to the other party in the course of negotiations on the lodging of an appeal, such reasons shall be given on request.     
3.  Paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to court proceedings instituted by the Federal Republic, it being understood that the principles set out in sub-paragraph (*b*) of paragraph 2 shall also be applied to the lodging of plaints.   
4.  Whether or not court proceedings are involved in the disputes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the German authorities shall terminate such disputes only in agreement with the authorities of the force or of the civilian component.   
5.  

(a) The sending State concerned shall meet all the obligations laid upon, and shall enjoy any benefits accruing to the Federal Republic as a result of judgments, decisions, orders and settlements (vollstreckbare Titel) in the court proceedings arising from disputes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.  

(b) Where, solely as a result of a Federal authority at the highest level having confirmed its essential interest in the lodging of a plaint or an appeal, the force or the civilian component has raised no objection to that action being taken, and if the plaint or appeal gives rise to additional costs in the court proceedings, agreement shall be reached on a case to case basis as to whether and to what extent the obligations arising from such court proceedings are chargeable to the sending State or to the Federal Republic.  

(c) Costs arising in connection with court proceedings which are not included in the costs awarded by the court shall be paid by the sending State if the force or the civilian component has given its agreement before the costs were incurred.     
6.  

(a) Disputes arising from direct procurement by the authorities of a force or of a civilian component of goods and services in the Federal territory shall be settled by German courts or by an independent arbitration tribunal.

Paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of this Article shall apply *mutatis mutandis* as regards relations between the Federal Republic and the sending State.  

(b) Agreements between the Federal Republic and a sending State shall, however, take precedence over the provisions of sub-paragraph *(a)* of this paragraph.     

### Article  45  

1.  Insofar as a force is not able to carry out its training programme on the accommodation made available for its permanent use without impairing the purposes of such training, the force shall have the right to conduct manoeuvres and other training exercises outside such accommodation in such measure as is necessary to the accomplishment of its defence mission and in accordance with orders or recommendations which the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe or any other competent authority of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may issue. The exercise of this right shall be governed by the relevant provisions of German law on the conduct of manoeuvres and other training exercises, except where otherwise provided in paragraphs 2 to 7 of this Article.   
2.  

(a) A force shall take all necessary measures to ensure that damage during the conduct of manoeuvres and other training exercises will be prevented as far as possible and that the economic use of plots of land (Grundstiicke) is not substantially impaired.  

(b) The force shall not re-use a plot of land on which considerable damage has been caused by manoeuvres or other training exercises, for a period of three months, except with the consent of the German authorities.  

(c) If the economic use of a plot of land has been substantially impaired by manoeuvres or other training exercises conducted by a force, the force shall refrain from conducting manoeuvres or other training exercises on such plot of land for so long as it is to be feared that manoeuvres or other training exercises might lead to further or renewed substantial impairment of the economic use of such plot of land.  

(d) Should the German authorities raise objections to the utilization of a specific plot of land on the grounds that its utilization is prohibited under sub-paragraph *(b)* or *(c)* of this paragraph, they shall, on the request of the authorities of the force, enter into negotiations on the use of an alternative plot of land which satisfies the training requirements of the force, taking due account of German interests as well as of militairy requirements.  

(e) Provisions of German law according to which the same terrain (Gelande) shall only in exceptional cases be used more than once in three months for exercises lasting several days shall not be applicable to a force.     
3.  To the extent that military reasons render it indispensable that a force utilise a nature preserve or a nature park or parts thereof, the Federal Government shall, unless the person entitled consents to such utilization, conclude with the Government of the sending State an agreement defining such nature preserve or nature park or parts thereof, and establishing to the extent necessary details of the utilization. In accordance with the agreement concluded, the force may utilise such nature preserve or nature park or parts thereof without the consent of the person entitled to grant it.   
4.  If the German authorities propose, instead of an area envisaged by the authorities of the force for the conduct of a manoeuvre or other training exercise, an alternative area which suffices for the training requirements of the force, the force shall not conduct the manoeuvre or other training exercise in the area first envisaged.   
5.  

(a) The authorities of a force shall notify the German au \thorities at the earliest possible date of their programmes of manoeuvres and other training exercises.  

(b) Prior to the commencement of a manoeuvre or other training exercise, the authorities of the force shall communicate to the German authorities by a given date, to be established by agreement between the Federal Government and the Governments of the sending States, a plan for the conduct of the manoeuvre or the other training exercise in question together with all necessary documentation and explanations and shall, if requested by the German authorities, discuss such plan with them. Such plan shall in particular contain data on the type, time of commencement, duration, and place, of the exercises and shall state whether public ways are to be wholly or partly closed or to be used other than as stipulated by German law, and if so, what safety measures are to be taken. Where use is to be made of aircraft in connection with a manoeuvre or other training exercise, such plan shall contain details of such use; Article 46 of the present Agreement shall remain unaffected.  

(c) Should no objections be raised by the German authorities to a plan within a fixed period of time to be established by agreement between the Federal Government and the Government of a sending State, the authorities of the force may act on the assumption that no such objections exist.  

(d) Should the German authorities raise objections to a plan, endeavours shall be made without delay by way of joint discussion to reach agreement, taking due account both of German interests and of military requirements.  

(e) Should the German authorities and the authorities of the force, either at local or at regional level, fail to reach agreement upon a plan within an appropriate period of time, the matter shall, at the request of the German authorities or the authorities of the force be further discussed by the Federal Government and the Government of the sending State in order to reach agreement.  

(f) Should the Federal Government and the Government of the sending State fail to reach agreement on a plan within an appropriate period of time, each Government may refer the matter to the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with a request for his expert opinion as to whether the planned manoeuvre or other training exercise is of primary importance to the accomplishment of the defence mission of the force and in conformity with the directives laid down within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Such expert opinion shall be given due consideration in the course of further negotiations between the Governments.  

(g) The force shall conduct the manoeuvre or other training exercise in accordance with the agreement reached on the plan.     
6.  

(a) After agreement has been reached on a plan, the authorities of the force shall inform the German authorities of their intention to conduct the manoeuvre or other training exercise in sufficient time to enable the German authorities to announce the manoeuvre or other training exercise at least two weeks prior to its commencement.  

(b) If for important reasons not foreseen during the discussion of the plan the German authorities raise objections to the conduct of the manoeuvre or other training exercise in a specific area or at a specific time, especially on the grounds that the manoeuvre or other training exercise would endanger public safety and order or public health, or would as a result of weather conditions cause considerable damage, endeavours shall be made without delay by way of joint discussion to reach agreement, taking due account of these reasons.  

(c) The local German authorities shall establish restrictive conditions, which under German law they may establish in individual cases (paragraph 1 of Section 66 of the Federal Requisitioning Law) only in agreement with the authorities of a force to the extent that the force is affected thereby.     
7.  For the purpose of effective coordination of civilian and military interests in the application of this Article, the Federal Government and the Government of a sending State may by agreement establish a Permanent Committee.   

### Article  46

The measures to be taken in accordance with such agreements shall be carried out by the German authorities.  

(d) The German authorities shall, when requested, name the enterprises which are responsible for supplying a force or a civilian component with water, gas, electricity, or for sewage disposal, and with whom contracts could be concluded. Insofar as the requirements of the force or of the civilian component cannot be satisfied by contracts between the authorities of the force or of the civilian component and the enterprises concerned, an agreement on the satisfaction of these requirements shall be concluded between the German authorities and the authorities of the force or of the civilian component, should the latter so request. The German authorities shall take appropriate measures to ensure the implementation of this agreement, if necessary by the conclusion of contracts.     
2.  The Federal Republic shall ensure that accommodation made available to a force or a civilian component within the framework of the provisions of the Forces Convention for its use and which is still in its possession upon the entry into force of the present Agreement shall remain available to the force or the civilian component until such time as it is to be released under sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of paragraphs 5 of this Article.

3.  

(a) Agreements (Überlassungsvereinbarungen) shall be concluded in writing in respect of the accommodation to be made available to a force or a civilian component pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article; such agreements shall contain data concerning size, type, location, condition and equipment of the accommodation, as well as details concerning its use. The accommodation shall be made available exclusively to the requiring force or civilian component for occupancy and use insofar as it is not otherwise agreed between the German authorities and the authorities of the force or of the civilian component.  

(b) Sub-paragraph *(a)* of this paragraph shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to accommodation which remains available to a force or a civilian component pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.

A force or a civilian component shall be responsable for carrying out such repairs and maintenance as are required to keep the accommodation made available to it in a proper state of preservation, unless with respect to accommodation made available against payment, the agreements concluded pursuant to sub-paragraph *(a)* of paragraph 3 of this Article provide otherwise.   
5.  The following provisions shall apply to the release of accommodation by a force or a civilian component: 

(a) 

(i) The authorities of a force or of a civilian component shall continually examine their requirements for accommodation, in order to ensure that the number and extent of the units of accommodation used by them are restricted to the minimum required. Furthermore, they shall at the request of the German authorities examine their requirements in specific individual cases. Without prejudice to any special agreements as to periods of use, accommodation which is no longer needed or for which alternative accommodation satisfying the needs of the force or of the civilian component is made available, shall after prior notification to the German authorities, be released without delay.  

(ii) The provisions in item (i) of this sub-paragraph shall apply *mutatis mutandis* where a force or a civilian component no longer requires the whole of a unit of accommodation and where partial release is possible.    

(b) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-paragraph *(a)* of this paragraph, the authorities of a force or of a civilian component shall give due consideration to requests by the German authorities for the release of a particular unit of accommodation in cases where, taking into account the common defence mission, German interest in the use of such accommodation clearly predominates.  

(c) Accommodation made available after the entry into force of the present Agreement to a force or a civilian component for a limited period of time shall be released on the expiry of such period of time provided such time limit was fixed in accordance with the information given by the authorities of the force or the civilian component at the time when their requirement for accommodation was notified; the period of use may be extended insofar as the owner or other entitled person agrees, or as requisitioning is permissible under German procurement legislation (deutsche Leistungsgesetzgebung).  

(d) Accommodation made available after the entry into force of the present Agreement to a force or a civilian component, and in respect of which an expropriation authority has issued an anticipatory possession order (vorzeitige Besitzeinweisung) under the Land Procurement Law, shall be released in the event of such possession order being rescinded.  

(e) Articles which have been requisitioned together with accommodation and which are still within such accommodation shall be released at the same time as the accommodation, unless the owner otherwise agrees.

(a) Articles of this kind, including those procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds, which were included in the construction costs of accommodation used by a force or a civilian component, shall be removed from such accommodation only with the consent of the German authorities.  

(b) The consent of the German authorities shall equally be obtained before fixtures, fittings and furnishings which have been affixed to, or specially made to measure for a specific unit of accommodation are removed. This shall not apply where such articles were procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds; however, the authorities of a force or of a civilian component shall, prior to the removal of such articles, give the German authorities timely notification of their intention so as to enable the latter, in appropriate cases, to propose an alternative solution.    

### Article  51  

1.  Movable property procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds shall, when the authorities of a force or of a civilian component establish that such property is no longer required by them, be handed over to the German authorities for disposal.   
2.  Agreements in derogation of the provision in paragraph 1 of this Article may be reached concerning the sale or other forms of disposal of such movable property. Net receipts from such disposal shall accrue to the Federal Republic.

### Article  52  

1.  Where a sending State intends to release in whole or in part accommodation or other property legally owned by the Federation or a Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) and made available to the force or to the civilian component for use, agreement shall be reached between the authorities of the force or of the civilian component and the German authorities concerning the residual value, if any, remaining at the time of release in improvements which were financed by the sending State out of its own funds.

The first and second sentences of this paragraph shall also apply to equipment and supplies procured by the sending State with its own funds and which by agreement are to remain on such accommodation.   
2.  Payment under paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be made to the extent that compensation for damage caused to accommodation or other property by the sending State is payable under Article 41 of the present Agreement or would have been payable if the claim had not been waived or the sending State had not been relieved of liability for such claims under that Article.   
3.  A sending State shall not be required to remove improvements, articles of equipment, or supplies from accommodation or other property legally owned by the Federal Republic or by a Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend).

4.  A sending State shall not assert any claim in respect of the residual value of improvements to property of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or in respect of improvements to property made available to the force or to the civilian component for use free of charge and owned by juristic persons in which the Federation or a Land financially participates, if the improvements have been financed out of funds made available to the sending State by the Federation or a Land. This shall not affect the setting off of the residual value of such improvements against compensation for damage caused during the period of use of such property by the force or the civilian component or during the removal of such improvements.   

### Article  53  

1.  Within accommodation made available for its exclusive use, a force or a civilian component may take all the measures necessary for the satisfactory fulfilment of its defence responsibilities.

1.  The German regulations for the prevention and control of infectious diseases of humans, animals and plants as well as for the prevention and control of plant pests shall apply to a force and a civilian component insofar as the regulations of the force in these fields do not prescribe equal or higher standards.

4.  Where German law prohibits the importation of certain articles, these articles may, with the approval of the German authorities, and provided that neither public health nor the cultivation of plants is endangered thereby, be imported by the authorities of a force.

(b) When seeking employment with an authority of a force or of a civilian component, the applicant shall be exclusively responsible, if so required, for furnishing proof that he has not been convicted of any offence. If the applicant cannot obtain a police certificate (Führungszeugnis), the German authorities shall, in accordance with the provisions of German law, provide him with an extract from the penal register if he presents a certificate from the force or the civilian component that he has applied for employment and if the issue of such extract does not endanger any essential German interests.

This shall apply to proceedings, to obtain protection against dismissal (Kündigungsschutzverfahren) as well as to other actions for a declaratory judgement (Feststellungsklage), or for damages or specific performance (Leistungsklage) arising out of the contract of employment. The amount of compensation shall be determined according to the provisions of German labour law. The contract of employment shall be deemed to be terminated upon a refusal to continue the employment. The force or the civilian component shall inform the person concerned without delay, and, in any case, not later than two weeks after service of the decision of the Labour Court, whether it chooses to continue the employment or to pay the compensation. If no statement is made within this period of time, the force or the civilian component shall be deemed to have chosen to pay the compensation.

7.  

(a) The authorities of a force or of a civilian component shall determine the number of jobs required and classify such jobs in accordance with the job groupings established under sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 5 of this Article. The individuals to fill such jobs shall be provisionally classified by the authorities of the force or of the civilian component into the appropriate wage or salary groups. The latter classification shall be subject to the approval of the competent German authorities. Such approval shall be deemed to have been given, unless the German authorities raise an objection within two weeks of the date of receipt of notification of the provisional classification. If an objection has been raised, the aprropriate classification shall be determined by consultation between the authorities of the force or of the civilian component and the German authorities. The remuneration for the period covered by the provisional classification shall be paid according to the final classification; the worker shall be so informed at the time of the provisional classification.  

(b) The authorities of the force shall carry out the classification of the members of the civilian service organizations. They shall inform the appropriate German authorities of such classification and shall give due consideration to any suggestions for amendment made by the latter.

10.  Where the German authorities carry out administrative work in respect of the employment of labour by a force or a civilian component and of its remuneration, the costs of such administrative work shall be reimbursed by the force in the amount of a percentage of the total wages and salaries, including allowances and gratuities, administered by the German authorities. The percentage shall be based on actual costs and shall be the subject of separate agreements between the German authorities and the authorities of each sending State, in which the criteria for assessing such costs shall also be laid down.

5.  Subject to due regard being paid to public safety and order, German regulations shall not apply to the construction, design and equipment of vehicles, trailers, inland water vessels or aircraft of a force and of a civilian component, if such vehicles, trailers, inland water vessels or aircraft conform to the regulations of the sending State.   
6.  A force and a civilian component shall be allowed to use civilian airfields and other landing areas not made available for their exclusive use for landing military aircraft only in cases of emergency or in accordance with administrative agreements or other arrangements concluded with the competent German authorities.

The German military authorities shall represent the military aviation interests of the forces within the German Commission for the Co-ordination of Civil and Military Aviation when established pursuant to the Recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization and of the Committee for European Air Space Coordination of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and shall be responsible for the presentation in this Commission of a co-ordinated military viewpoint. Representatives of the forces shall, where appropriate, be given adequate opportunity to present their views before the Commission.

### Article  58  

1.  A force, a civilian component, their members and dependents shall be entitled to use publicly and privately owned German transport facilities and services which serve the needs of public transport in the Federal Republic. Unless otherwise agreed, the exercise of this right shall be subject to the generally applicable transportation regulations.   
2.  

(a) Tariffs applicable to a force and a civilian component for the use of the transport facilities and services referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be not less favourable than those applicable to the German Armed Forces. Such tariffs shall be fixed or approved by the competent German authorities in accordance with German transportation legislation. The authorities of the force shall have the right to participate in negotiations with the carriers concerning military tariffs. When, in respect of transportation services for a force and its civilian component, special conditions arise for which the military tariffs do not provide, the German authorities shall, after negotiations between the authorities of the force and the carriers, make suitable additions to the military tariffs within the scope of their legal powers.  

(b) Military tariffs shall be computed on the basis of a simplified scheme, which shall take into account the special character of military traffic and facilitate their application by a force or a civilian component.  

(c) The overall effect of the application of military tariff rates shall result in no less favourable treatment for a force or a civilian component than would have resulted from the application of public tariff rates including relevant special tariffs.     
3.  The Federal Republic shall give sympathetic consideration to requests by a force for construction of additional facilities or for modification of existing facilities, where the transportation requirements of the force cannot otherwise be met.   
4.  The German authorities shall, where necessary, take appropriate steps within their competence to ensure that requirements of a force with respect to tank cars, sleeping and dining cars will be satisfied on reasonable terms by contractual arrangements between the authorities of the force and the enterprises which provide such services on a commercial basis to other users.   

### Article  59  

1.

Exchange offices shall be established by mutual agreement.   
3.  Mail posted at forces post offices may bear stamps of the sending State concerned.

3.  

(a) With the consent of the German authorities a force may set up, operate, and maintain wire telecommunication facilities outside accommodation used by it if 

(i) compelling reasons of military security exist, or  

(ii) the German authorities are either not in a position to provide, or forgo the provision of, the facilities required.    

(b) Expeditious procedures for obtaining the consent of the German authorities shall be ensured by administrative agreement.     
4.  

(a) A force may continue to operate and maintain telecommunication facilities taken into use under then existing regulations prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement.  

(b) Telecommunication facilities, the installation of which under then existing regulations was begun but not completed prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement, may be taken into use within a period of six months after that date, provided that they are included in a list which shall be submitted to the Federal Government upon the entry into force of the present Agreement.     
5.  

(a) A force shall have the right to operate its own sound and television broadcasting stations for the force, the civilian component, their members and dependents, provided that such stations do not adversely affect German broadcasting services in an unreasonable manner. Subject to this condition, existing broadcasting stations of this type may continue in operation. Additional stations may be established and operated only with the agreement of the German authorities.  

(b) A force, a civilian component, their members and dependents, may set up and operate sound and television broadcast receiving apparatus free of charge and without individual licenses.

8.  

(a) In establishing and operating telecommunication facilities, a force shall observe the provisions of the International Telecommunications Convention, Buenos Aires, of 1952, or of such other instrument as may replace it, and of any other international instruments in the field of telecommunications binding on the Federal Republic.  

(b) A force shall be exempt from the provisions referred to in sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph to the extent that such exemption is granted to the German Armed Forces under German domestic regulations.  

(c) In concluding future international agreements in the field of telecommunications, the German authorities shall, after consultation with a force, give adequate consideration to the telecommunication requirements of the force.     
9.  

(a) A force shall take all measures which can reasonably be expected of it to avoid or eliminate interference caused to German telecommunication services by the telecommunication or other electrical facilities of the force.

### Article  61  

1.  Subject to the effects of the tax and customs exemptions provided in the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, in the present Agreement or in any other applicable agreement, the prices of deliveries and services to a force or a civilian component shall correspond to the current price levels in the Federal territory; they may not exceed the prices admissible in the case of deliveries and services to German authorities. Where goods are subsidized in the interest of the individual German consumer, such subsidies cannot be claimed by a force or a civilian component unless these goods are intended for the use of, or consumption by, persons falling under the category of labour within the meaning of Article 56 of the present Agreement.   
2.  The provisions of the present Agreement concerning wages, transportation and telecommunication tariffs shall not be affected by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article.   

### Article  62  

1.  Where requisitioning procedures (Anforderungsverfahren) are carried out on behalf of a force or a civilian component under German procurement legislation, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) The proceeding shall be instituted by the German authorities to be determined in consultation with the authorities of the force or of the civilian component.  

(b) In accordance with administrative agreements, the competent German authorities shall undertake the exercise of the rights and the fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the position of the force or the civilian component as recipients of goods, services and facilities (Leistungsempfänger). However, the force or the civilian component shall itself fulfil such obligations as by their nature cannot be fulfilled by the German authorities. The German authorities representing the interests of the force or of the civilian component in matters concerning the amount of compensation payable shall consent to proposals in that regard made by the person liable to supply goods, services and facilities (Leistungspflichtiger) or by the assessment authority only after consultation with the authorities of the force or of the civilian component; similarly, they shall themselves make proposals regarding the amount of compensation payable only after such consultation. The provisions of Article 63 of the present Agreement shall remain unaffected.  

(c) Lawsuits on behalf of, or against, the force or the civilian component arising out of their position as recipients of goods, services and facilities shall be instituted or defended by the Federal Republic in its own name.     
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply in respect of the Restricted Areas Law and the Land Procurement Law.   

### Article  63  

1.  If and to the extent that it is provided in paragraphs 2 to 7 of this Article, no payment shall be made for property or services used by a force for its own purposes or for the purposes of a civilian component or rendered to it for such purposes.   
2.  Public roads, highways, and bridges may be used free of charge by a force or by a civilian component.   
3.  A force or a civilian component shall enjoy free of charge administrative services and assistance, including the services of the German police, public health, and fire protection, as well as meteorological, topographical, and cartographical services to at least the same extent as the German Armed Forces. The same shall apply to the use of navigable waters.   
4.  

(a) Except to the extent that other arrangements have been or will be made, property legally owned by the Federation (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes stehend) or which has been or will be procured or constructed from funds of the Occupation Costs and Mandatory Expenditures or Support Costs budgets, may be used free of charge by a force or a civilian component. This shall not apply to the use of property owned or administered by the German Federal Railways or Federal Post.  

(b) Except to the extent that other arrangements have been or will be made, the Federal Republic shall ensure that a sending State to which property legally owned by a Land (rechtlich im Eigentum eines Landes stehend) has been or will be made available for use is relieved from the liability for any possible claim to compensation that may be due to the Land under German law.  

(c) Except to the extent that other arrangements have been or will be made, rental for the use of property not falling under the first sentence of sub-paragraph (*a*) or under sub-paragraph (*b*) of this paragraph and which has been or will be reconstructed with funds made available by the Federal Republic or with a sending State's own funds shall be reduced in the proportion which the cost of reconstruction bears to the total value of the property.  

(d) Exemption from payment for the use of property as set forth in sub-paragraphs (*a*) to (*c*) of this paragraph shall not, however, extend to 

(i) cost of repairs and maintenance;  

(ii) current public charges on property to the extent that the Federation is obliged under German law to pay or reimburse such charges;  

(iii) other operating costs.       
5.  

(a) The following items of the expenditure arising in consequence of goods and services demanded or rights restricted, transferred or withdrawn under German laws at the instance of a force or of a civilian component, shall not be borne by the sending State: 

(i) compensation payable under the Land Procurement Law with the exception of 

(aa) compensation for anticipatory possession (Besitzeinweisungsentschädigung) except in the case of Land Procurement actions (Landbeschaffungsvorhaben) initiated after the entry into force of the present Agreement;  

(bb) compensation payments for the use of accommodation made available to the force or the civilian component and not legally owned by the Federation or by a Land (nicht rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes), except in the case of accommodation made available to the force or the civilian component after the entry into force of the present Agreement for the purpose of the erection of permanent structures;    

(ii) compensation for restricted areas (Schutzbereichentschadigung) payable under German law to the Lander, insofar as prejudice caused to property (Vermögensnachteile) by the establishment of the restricted area arises only from the restriction of economic use or other exploitation of the property.    

(b) Where in consequence of the procurement of land for a force or a civilian component other costs arise for the Federation, negotiations on a case to case basis shall take place between the German authorities and the authorities of the force, taking into account all relevant factors, and without prejudice to the provisions of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 6 of this Article, to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the sending State for whose benefit the land is to be procured shall bear such costs, and agreements shall be concluded thereon.  

(c) Where in cases in which restricted areas have been provided at the instance of a force the compensation therefor is not payable in the form of recurrent payments, the German authorities and the authorities of the force may enter into negotiations in appropriate cases, and on a case to case basis, concerning apportionment of the compensation, taking into account all relevant factors, including the period of use by the force of the accommodation for which the restricted area exists.     
6.  

(a) Of the expenditure arising out of any kind of construction works of a force or a civilian component, or in connection with such works, the sending State shall not be liable for expenditure incurred in evacuating land (Räumung).  

(b) If installations and facilities serving transportation and telecommunications, electricity, gas and water supply, or sewage disposal, which are established, modified, reinforced, or extended at the instance of the authorities of a force or of a civilian component serve also to satisfy German needs, the expenditure, including the cost of repair and maintenance, on such installations and facilities shall be apportioned in a manner which corresponds to the extent of the German interest as compared with the interest of the sending State. The amounts shall in each individual case be agreed between the German authorities and the authorities of the force. This arrangement shall also apply to the costs of repair and maintenance of installations and facilities of the kind mentioned which the German side plans to close down or dismantle, but which are to be retained at the request of a force or a civilian component.  

(c) If in consequence of land procurement for a force or a civilian component, or as a result of construction works carried out by or for the benefit of a force or of a civilian component, installations and facilities serving transportation and telecommunications, electricity, gas and water supply, or sewage disposal, require re-routing or replacing either because they are no longer available for public use or it can be shown that it is no longer practicable so to use them, the sending State shall bear expenditure which arises only to the extent that the hitherto prevailing standard is not exceeded.     
7.  

(a) If military or other aircraft used by a force are permanently accommodated on civil airfields, including civil airports, not made available for the exclusive use of the force, payment which varies from the fees valid under German regulations may be agreed upon for the jointly used installations and facilities. Such payment may by arrangement be in services or in kind.  

(b) Emergency landings made by military or other aircraft used by a force shall be exempt from fees.     

### Article  64  

Administrative services and assistance, including the services of the German police, public health, and fire protection services, meteorological, topographical, and cartographical services, and other public services as well as public facilities, shall be made available without charge to the members of a force or of a civilian component or to dependents, in their own right, to the same extent as such facilities and services are available without charge to other persons in the Federal territory. The same shall apply to the use of public roads, highways, and bridges, and of navigable waters.  

### Article  65  

1.  

(a) The relief from customs duties referred to in paragraph 4 of Article XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall be granted not only in respect of goods which at the time of their importation are the property of a force or a civilian component, but also in respect of goods delivered to a force or a civilian component in fulfilment of contracts concluded by the force or the civilian component directly with a person or persons not domiciled in the Federal Republic or Berlin (West). Such relief shall apply irrespective of whether such goods are carried in transport of the force or the civilian component or by commercial transport.  

(b) Customs duties and excise taxes, including the Turnover Equalization Tax (Umsatzausgleichsteuer), shall not be levied in respect of imported goods which are withdrawn from customs-free areas or from continuous customs control for delivery to a force or a civilian component under contracts which an official procurement agency of the force or of the civilian component has concluded with a person or persons domiciled in the Federal Republic or in Berlin (West), provided that payment therefor is made in the currency of the sending State. This proviso shall also be deemed, to have been fulfilled if payment is made in Deutsche Mark, which the force or the civilian component has obtained by the conversion of such currency in the Federal Republic through agreed agencies, or in Deutsche Mark which, by special agreement between the governments concerned, may be so used for this purpose.     
2.  The relief referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply equally to goods imported or acquired by a force or a civilian component for disposal to their members or to dependents for their private use or consumption. Except where in specific cases it is otherwise agreed between the authorities of the force and the German authorities, disposal should be made only through specified services of the force or the civilian component or through organizations serving them, the names of which shall be notified to the Federal Government.   
3.  A force or a civilian component shall be permitted to dispose of goods in the Federal territory to persons other than members of the force or of the civilian component or dependents in accordance with agreements to be concluded with the German authorities. The fulfilment of the obligations under German customs legislation arising from the disposal of the goods shall be the reponsibility of the person acquiring such goods. The force or the civilian component shall permit removal of the goods only on production by the person concerned of a certificate from the German customs authority concerned to the effect that he has settled all relevant matters with the German customs administration.   
4.  A force and the competent German authorities shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the smooth and rapid clearing to imports and exports of the force and the civilian component by the German customs authorities.   
5.  Customs control by the German authorities in respect of imports and exports of a force or a civilian component shall be exercised in accordance with the following principles: 

(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (*b*), (*c*) and (*d*) of this paragraph, consignments of a force or of a civilian component may be examined by the German customs authorities as to the number, type, marking and weight of the individual packages.  

(b) 

(i) The German customs authorities may also examine the contents of consignments. Such examination, so far as packages which are sealed with an official seal of a force or of the military authorities of a sending State are concerned, shall take place only in cases of serious suspicion. So far as other consignments are concerned, examination may also take place on a spot-check basis. The goods compartments of vehicles which are sealed as described in the second sentence of this item, and closed packages, shall be examined only in the presence of representatives of the force or of the civilian component designated for that purpose, unless in any particular case the force or the civilian component does not elect to be represented.  

(ii) The extent of the examinations and the methods by which they shall be carried out shall be the subject of special agreements to be concluded between the authorities of a force and the German customs authorities. Such agreements shall take into account the different kinds of consignment, the mode of transport, the system operated by the force, and all other relevant factors. A force or a civilian component may request that the examination take place not at the frontier but at or near the place of destination of the consignments. In such cases the German customs authorities shall be entitled to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the consignment reaches the place of examination intact.    

(c) If the German customs authorities so request, consignments, which, according to the certified statements of the authorities of a force, contain military equipment to which special security regulations apply, shall be subject to examination to be carried out only by representatives of the force specially designated for that purpose. The result of the examination shall be notified to the competent German authority.  

(d) The provisions of sub-paragraphs (*a*), (*b*) and (*c*) of this paragraph shall apply in principle also to consignments of a force which arrive at or are sent from military airfields. The German customs authorities shall, however, content themselves with occasional checks which shall be undertaken after arrangements have been made with the authorities of the force responsible for the airfield in question. The authorities of the force shall carry out a regular control of all such consignments. Customs control in the interior of aircraft which are military equipment to which special security regulations apply, shall be carried out only specially designated representatives of the force.     
6.  Export of goods acquired in the Federal territory by a force or a civilian component shall be subject to the deposit at the customs office of a certificate similar to that referred to in paragraph 4 of Article XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, except insofar as within the scope of paragraph 10 of that Article such certificate will be dispensed with.   

### Article  66  

1.  The members of a force or of a civilian component and dependents may, in addition to their personal effects and furniture and their private motor vehicles, import other goods intended for their personal or domestic use or consumption free of duty or any other import tax. This privilege shall apply not only to goods which are the property of such persons but also to goods sent to them by way of gift or delivered to them in fulfilment of contracts directly concluded with a person or persons not domiciled in the Federal Republic or Berlin (West).   
2.  In the case of certain goods designated by the competent German authorities which are peculiarly the subject of customs contraventions, the privilege set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply only if such goods are imported personally by members of a force, of a civilian component or dependents in their accompanying baggage and in quantities fixed by the competent German authorities in agreement with the authorities of the force.   
3.  In doubtful cases the German customs officials shall be entitled to require a document to be produced certifying that the imported goods are intended for the personal or domestic use or consumption of the person importing them; this, however, shall not apply to goods the importation of which is limited in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Such certificates shall be issued only by a limited number of officials, who have been specially designated for this purpose by the authorities of the force and whose names and specimen signatures have been notified to the German authorities.   
4.  Disposal of goods imported dutyfree or acquired under taxrelief shall be permitted among members of the forces, of the civilian components and dependents. Unless exceptions have been generally authorized by the German authorities, disposal to other persons shall be permitted only after notification to, and approval of, the German authorities.   
5.  

(a) The customs control of goods sent through the postal or freight services of a force, by or to the members of the force, of the civilian component or dependents, shall be exercised by the German customs authorities at places designated by agreement between those authorities and the competent authorities of the force. The customs inspection shall take place in the presence of representatives of the authorities of the force.  

(b) If, for the purpose of applying the provisions concerning exchange control contained in Article 69 of the present Agreement, it becomes necessary to carry out in post offices of a force inspection of letters and postal packets sent by or to members of the force, of the civilian component or dependents, the sender or the receiver or an authorized representative of either must be present when such letters and packets are opened. The extent of these inspections and the manner in which they shall be carried out shall be agreed between the authorities of the force and the German authorities.     
6.  The members of a force or of a civilian component or dependents may re-export free of exit dues (Ausgangsabgaben) goods brought by them into the Federal Republic. They may also, without being subject to economic export prohibitions or limitations and exit dues, export, in quantities consistent with their economic standing, goods which they own and which are not intended for trade. In doubtful cases the German customs authorities shall be entitled to require a document to be produced certifying that these conditions are fulfilled. This document shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of paragraph 3 of this Article.   
7.  When a customs control of members of a force, of a civilian component or dependents takes place at a customs office at which frontier liaison officials of a force are stationed, the German customs officials shall call in such officials if contraventions are discovered or if difficulties arise in connection with the inspections.   

### Article  67  

1.  A force shall not be subject to taxation in respect of matters falling exclusively within the scope of its official activities nor in respect of property devoted to such activities. This shall, however, not apply in respect of taxes which may arise from commercial trading by the force in the German economy or in respect of property devoted to this purpose. Deliveries made and services rendered by the force to its members, members of the civilian component and dependents shall not be regarded as commercial trading in the German economy.   
2.  Exemption from customs duties and other import and export duties on goods imported or exported by a force or a civilian component, or acquired by them from customs-free areas or from installations under customs control, shall be determined in accordance with Article XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and with Article 65 of the present Agreement.   
3.  

(a) 

(i) The tax relief provided under items (ii) to (iv) of this sub-paragraph shall be granted when goods or services are procured by an official procurement agency of a force or a civilian component for the use of, or consumption by, the force, the civilian component, their members, or dependents, provided that payment is made in the currency of the sending State. This proviso shall also be deemed to have been fulfilled if payment is made in Deutsche Mark which the force or its authorized agent has obtained by the conversion of such currency in the Federal Republic, or in Deutsche Mark whose use is admissible within the scope of the provisions of this paragraph in accordance with any special agreement reached between the German authorities and the authorities of the sending State. Tax exemptions and refunds shall be taken into account in calculating prices.  

(ii) Deliveries and services to a force or a civilian component shall be exempt from the turnover tax. On request, suppliers shall be granted such refunds as are provided in the German Turnover Tax Law in the event of export. Deliveries to a force or a civilian component shall be deemed to be wholesale deliveries.  

(iii) Transportation services rendered to a force or a civilian component by the German Federal Railways or by commercial transportation enterprises shall be exempt from transportation tax. Exemption from transportation tax shall not be granted for transportation services rendered for or by a supplier or person who renders services in connection with deliveries or services to a force or a civilian component whether carried by factory-owned longdistance transport (Werkfernverkehr), by the German Federal Railways or by other commercial carriers.  

(iv) Goods delivered to a force or a civilian component from the free inland trade (zollrechtlich freier Verkehr) shall be granted the exemptions, refunds or price discounts provided by customs, excise, and fiscal monopoly legislation in the event of export.    

(b) Sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph shall apply equally when the German authorities carry out procurement or construction works for a force or a civilian component,  

(c) The relief referred to in sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of this paragraph shall be granted subject to furnishing proof to the appropriate German authorities that the requirements for such grant are fulfilled. The form of furnishing proof shall be established by agreement between the German authorities and the authorities of the sending State concerned.     
4.  The special arrangements provided in paragraph 11 of Article XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement for fuel, oil and lubricants shall be made in conformity with sub-paragraph *(b)* of paragraph 1 of Article 65 of the present Agreement and with paragraph 3 of this Article.   

### Article  68  

1.  Members of a force or of a civilian component and dependents shall not be deprived of any tax benefits which they enjoy by virtue of any international agreement with the Federal Republic.   
2.  The insurance tax (Versicherungsteuer) is to be paid in those cases where the insurance premium is paid to an inland insurer or an authorized inland representative of a foreign insurer, but not where the premium is paid directly to a foreign insurer. With respect to insurance for private motor vehicles of members of a force or of a civilian component or of dependents, payment of the insurance tax is also not required where in individual cases the insurance premium, which is payable directly to the foreign insurer, is exceptionally paid to the authorized inland representative of such foreign insurer.   
3.  The fact that no residence is established in the Federal territory in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article X of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall not mean that members of a force or of a civilian component and dependents are to be regarded as foreign purchasers within the meaning of the turnover tax legislation.   
4.  Dependents shall be treated for the purposes of Article X of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement in the same manner as members of a force or of a civilian component.   

### Article  69  

1.  The rights of the authorities of a force or of a civilian component, of the members of a force or of a civilian component, or of dependents to import, export and possess the currency of the Federal Republic and instruments denominated in such currency in accordance with the regulations referred to in Article XIV of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall remain unaffected by the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.   
2.  The authorities of a force or of a civilian component shall have the right to import, export and possess currency, other than that of the Federal Republic, instruments denominated in any such currency and military scrip denominated in the currency of any sending State.

3.  Where the activities of an enterprise include business not conforming to the conditions set forth in paragraph 2 of this Article, the granting of exemptions and benefits provided in paragraph 1 shall be conditional upon a clear legal or administrative separation between those activities which are performed exclusively for the force and those which are not.

The German authorities shall request such information of the authorities of a force or of a civilian component only if the data necessary for assessment cannot be obtained otherwise, for instance, from official certificates (Abwicklungsscheine) concerning the procurement of goods and services subject to tax relief if such certificates have been furnished to the German financial authorities, or from information which can be supplied to those authorities by other German authorities. The German authorities shall take measures to prevent the disclosure of the information to unauthorized third parties.

2.  In imposing a penalty in respect of an offence committed prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement, the German court or authority shall give due consideration to the penalty prescribed by the law of the sending State to which the accused was subject at the time of the commission of the offence, if it appears that such penalty is lighter than that prescribed by German law.

### Article  77  

The Standing Commission provided for in paragraph 8 of Article 17 of the Forces Convention shall, in the interests of common defence and air safety, for the time being continue its functions in the field of co-ordination of civil and military aviation. When the German Commission referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 57 of the present Agreement, together with any additional organization required to ensure effective co-ordination between civil aviation and all military air forces in the Federal Republic, has been set up by the German authorities and is in a position to satisfy the requirements of the forces in this field, the Standing Commission shall be dissolved after adequate prior consultation between the German authorities and the authorities of the forces concerned.  

### Article  78  

1.  The Mixed Commission established under paragraph 8 of Article 44 of the Forces Convention shall continue to be the competent body to determine whether a dismissal on security grounds was justified, provided that a request made under that provision was received by the Commission prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement.   
2.  Decisions reached by the Mixed Commission shall continue to be binding on German Labour Courts after the entry into force of the present Agreement.   

### Article  79  

1.

2.  Paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply also to goods and services ordered before the entry into force of the present Agreement and for which payment is made in Deutsche Mark from funds made available to a force by the Federal Republic as mutual defence aid before that date.   

### Article  80  

The provisions of Article XV of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall apply to the present Agreement, it being understood that references in that Article to other provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall be deemed to be references to those provisions as supplemented by the present Agreement.  

### Article  81  

1.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, the present Agreement shall remain in force while forces are stationed in the Federal Republic in accordance with the terms of the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 October 1954 or any arrangement which may replace it.

### PART  I  

####Agreed Minutes and Declarations concerning the NATO Status of Forces Agreement

####Re Article I, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (a)

1.  In view of the definition of a “force”, the Federal Republic regards the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement as being applicable also to such forces of a sending State as are temporarily in the Federal territory in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 October 1954.   
2.  Service attaches of a sending State in the Federal Republic, the members of their staffs and any other service personnel enjoying diplomatic or other special status in the Federal Republic shall not be regarded as constituting or included in a “force” for the purpose of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement.   
3.  Except in cases of military exigency, the Governments of the sending States will make every effort not to station in the territory of the Federal Republic as members of a force persons who are solely Germans.   
4.  

(a) The following non-appropriated fund organizations and activities are integral parts of the United States force: 

(i) European Exchange System (EES)  

(ii) Air Forces Europe Exchange (AFEX)  

(iii) USAREUR Class VI Agency  

(iv) USAFE Class VI Agency  

(v) European Motion Picture Service

(xiii) Stars and Stripes  

(xiv) Other non-appropriated fund organizations, including authorized clubs and messes    

(b) The organizations referred to under item (xiv) of subparagraph (*a*) of this paragraph shall conduct tax- and duty-free procurement through officially designated procurement agencies of the force in accordance with agreed procedures.  

(c) The list of organizations and special funds under sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph is subject to amendment as organizational changes require.     
5.  Members of the Armed Forces of a sending State stationed in Berlin, of their civilian components and dependents shall be considered to be, and treated as, members of the force, of the civilian component or dependents while on leave in the Federal territory.   

####Re Article V, paragraph 1, second sentence

1.  The authorities of a sending State may authorize the members of the force to wear civilian clothes in accordance with the regulations of the sending State.   
2.  Paragraph 1 of this Section shall also apply to French detachments in which individual members of the force are regrouped and officered (recruits proceeding to their assigned units in the Federal Republic or returning home after discharge), if the French regulations allow such personnel to cross the border in civilian clothes.   

####Re Article VII

1.  The Federal Republic regards offences dealt with under administrative penal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren) and offences subject to a fine only (Ordnungswidrigkeiten) as offences punishable by the law of the receiving State within the meaning of Article VII and the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement directly relating thereto.   
2.  

(a) In view of sub-paragraph (*b*) of paragraph 1 of Article VII, the Federal Republic does not consider it to be within its competence to decide on requests for extradition of members of a force, of a civilian component or dependents.  

(b) The sending States will not act upon requests for extradition of Germans who are present in the Federal territory as members of a force or as dependents.     

####Re Article IX, paragraph 6

The Federal Republic is prepared to give the most favourable consideration to requests for the grant to dependents of travelling facilities and concessions with regard to fares. Such consideration will be exercised only within the framework of existing tariffs and where comparable circumstances exist.  

####Re Article XIX

The Federal Government recognizes that it would be undesirable for the status of the forces to remain unsettled. It will therefore exercise the right of denunciation to which it is entitled under Article XIX only for urgent reasons and only after consultation with the Governments of the sending States. The Federal Government is prepared in the event of denunciation to enter into negotiations with the Governments of the sending States without delay for the conclusion of adequate alternative arrangements. Pending the conclusion of such arrangements it would assure to the forces a position not prejudicial to the stability of their essential stationing conditions.  

### PART  II  

####Re Article 1

In the event of the Supplementary Agreement entering into force before the expiry of the transitional period provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 1 and in Article 3 of the Treaty between the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the Settlement of the Saar Question, dated 27 October 1956, the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement affecting matters which pursuant to Chapter II of that Treaty are not subject to German jurisdiction shall not be applicable in the Saar before the expiry of that period.

####Re Article 5

The provisions of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 1 of Article 5 shall not apply to entry into, or exit from, the Federal territory.  

####Re Article 7

In the application of the German regulations on compulsory military service, periods of time spent in the Federal territory as a member of a force, of a civilian component or as a dependent shall be disregarded.  

####Re Article 8

1.  Expulsion may be carried out only in accordance with the provisions of the German legislation on police control of aliens (Ausländerpolizeirecht).   
2.  The extent to which provisions of the German Police Ordinance on Aliens (Ausländerpolizeiverordnung) of 22 August 1938, at present in force, have become obsolete, is indicated by the following explanations: 

(a) The following terms shall, where they occur in the text of the Ordinance, be replaced as follows: 

(i) “Reich territory” by “Federal territory”;  

(ii) “Reich” by “Federation”;  

(iii) “Reich frontier” by “Federal frontier”;  

(iv) “District Police Administration” (Kreispolizeiverwaltung) by the appropriate “City or District Administrations” (Stadt-, Kreisverwaltungen) established by Land laws insofar as they have taken over the functions of the District Police Administration;  

(v) “Reichsmark” by “Deutsche Mark”;  

(vi) “Reich Minister of the Interior” by “Federal Minister of the Interior”.    

(b) Re Section 5, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (*a*): The term “people's community” (Volksgemeinschaft) is deemed to have been deleted by virtue of Article II of Control Council Law No. 1, which reads as follows: “No German enactment, however or whenever enacted, shall be applied judicially or administratively in any instance where such application would cause injustice or inequality, either 

a) by favouring any person because of his connection with the National Socialist German Labour Party, its formations, affiliated associations, or supervised organizations, or  

b) by discriminating against any person by reason of his race, nationality, religious beliefs, or opposition to the National Socialist German Labour Party or its doctrines.”    

(c) Re Section 5, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (*c*): The legal basis for carrying out castration (Section 42 *a,* item 5, and Section 42 *k* of the Criminal Code) has been eliminated by Article I of Control Council Law No. 11. Moreover, castration is not permissible under the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Basic Law, which reads as follows: “Everyone has the right to life and to inviolability of his person.”  

(d) Re Section 5, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (*g*) : The term “race” is deemed to have been deleted by virtue of Article II of Control Council Law No. 1 (see subparagraph *(b)* and of paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Basic Law, which reads as follows: “No one may be prejudiced or favoured because of his sex, his parentage, his race, his language, his homeland and origin, his faith or his religious and political opinions.”  

(e) Re Section 5, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (*h*): The term “gipsy” is deemed to have been deleted by virtue of Article II of Control Council Law No. 1 (see sub paragraph (*b*) and by paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Basic Law (see sub-paragraph (*d*)).  

(f) Re Section 7, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (*c*): Under the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 16 of the Basic Law, persons persecuted for political reasons shall enjoy the right of asylum. Such right is not affected by paragraph 1 of Section 7 of the Police Ordinance on Aliens. The same applies to foreign refugees within the meaning of the Agreement on the Legal Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 (Bundesgesetzblatt 1953 Teil II, page 559).  

(g) Re Section 7, paragraph 4 and paragraph 5, sentence 2: Both German nationals and aliens may be detained only if the following provisions of paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 104 of the Basic Law are observed: 

“2. Only judges may decide on the admissibility or extension of a deprivation of liberty. Where such deprivation is not based on the order of a judge, a judicial decision must be obtained without delay. The police may hold no one on their own authority in their own custody longer than the end of the day after the arrest. Details shall be regulated by legislation.  

4. A relative of the person detained or a person enjoying his confidence must be notified without delay of any judicial decision ordering or extending a deprivation of liberty.”    

(h) Re Section 7, paragraph 5: The comments in sub-paragraphs (*f*) and (*g*) apply.  

(i) Re Section 9, paragraphs 2 and 4: Detention prior to expulsion likewise is permissible only in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 104 of the Basic Law (see sub-paragraph (*g*)).  

(j) Re Section 11, paragraph 1, last sentence, paragraph 2, last sentence, and paragraphs 5 and 6: These provisions are deemed to have been deleted or to have become inapplicable by virtue of paragraph 4 of Article 19 of the Basic Law, which reads as follows: “Should any person's right be violated by public authority, recourse to the court shall be open to him. If no other court has jurisdiction, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts.” Identical provisions are contained in the administrative court laws of the Länder (e. g. for the Länder of the former British Zone of Occupation, Ordinance No. 165 of British Military Government on Jurisdiction of Administrative Courts in the British Zone - Verordnungsblatt, British Zone 1948, page 263).  

(k) Re Section 11, paragraph 4: The effect of this provision has been limited insofar as, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 19 of the Basic Law (see sub-paragraph *(j)*), recourse may be had to the administrative court against denial of the staying effect of a complaint.  

(l) Re Section 14: The provision has become obsolete by the lapse of time.  

(m) Re Section 15, paragraph 1: In connection with this provision, note should be taken of paragraph 1 of Article 116 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: “Unless otherwise provided by law, a German within the meaning of this Basic Law is a person who possesses German nationality or who has been received in the territory of the German Reich, as it existed on 31 December 1937, as a refugee or expellee of German stock (Volkszugehörigkeit) or as the spouse or descendant of such person.”  

(n) Re Section 17, paragraph 2: The authority to issue ordinances having the force of law or general administrative regulations has become extinct by virtue of paragraph 3 of Article 129 of the Basic Law.     
3.  The provisions of German law concerning expulsion, and in particular paragraph 1 of Section 5 of the Police Ordinance on Aliens shall apply only where the reasons for expulsion mentioned therein are not incompatible with the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and of the Supplementary Agreement.   

####Re Article 12

The expression “German law on self-defence (Notwehr)” in paragraph 2 of Article 12 should be construed in accordance with the following German interpretation of Section 53 of the German Criminal Code: 

(a) Section 53 of the German Criminal Code reads as follows: “No act is punishable if demanded in self-defence. Self-defence is such defence as is necessary to avert an imminent unlawful attack upon oneself or another. An act in excess of necessary self-defence is not punishable if the perpetrator exceeded the bounds of defence in consternation, fear or alarm.”  

(b) In construing Section 53 of the German Criminal Code, legal practice has long followed some well-established principles which may be summarised as follows: 

(i) Attack means any act which is aimed at violating the legally protected rights or interests of another person.  

(ii) The nature of the protected rights or interests which are threatened by the attack is not material, The objects of an attack include not only life and limb but all legally protected interests, such as liberty, morality, honour, property, possession or hunting rights.  

(iii) The protected interest to be defended need not belong to the person defending it; it may belong to some other person. In the latter case self-defence is termed defence in aid of a third person (Nothilfe).  

(iv) An attack which the attacked person is under no obligation to suffer shall be deemed to be an unlawful attack. Thus self-defence is permissible not only against a person guilty of an unlawful act but also against an incompetent, an insane person, a child, or one acting in unavoidable error.  

(v) An attack shall be deemed an “imminent” attack if it is immediately impending, or is in progress, or is continuing; an attack threatened in the future or which has been completed is not considered an imminent attack. Whether or not an attack is imminent is determined by the objective facts and not by the subjective belief of the person acting in self-defence.  

(vi) An attack shall be deemed to be continuing and therefore imminent until the danger arising from it to the threatened legally protected interest either has completely passed or, conversely, until the attack has resulted in the irretrievable loss of such interest. For instance, if a thief escapes with a stolen article or a poacher with a head of game, self-defence is permissible during hot pursuit and so long as the object in question, insofar as the perpetrator is concerned, has not reached a place of safety.  

(vii) The act of self-defence must be necessary to avert an attack. The necessity shall be ascertained from case to case by applying objective standards. In principle, the extent of permissible defence is determined by the severity and persistence of the attack and by the means which are available to the person attacked for his defence.  

(viii) A legally protected interest of the attacker shall be deemed to have been infringed upon unnecessarily if the person threatened by the attack is able to evade the attack without abandoning his own interests.  

(ix) As a rule, it is not necessary that the value of the legally protected interests of the attacked person should be balanced against the loss which the attacker might sustain (principle of proportionality). But this principle is subject to limitations. The killing of a thief is not a required (necessary) act of defence if the articles which the attacked person risks losing are only of minor value (this principle is controversial).  

(x) It suffices that the act of self-defence is required in order to avert an attack against oneself or any other person. It is not necessary that the attack is aimed at a relative within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Section 52 of the German Criminal Code.  

(xi) Only insofar as directed against the attacker shall an act of defence be deemed to be an act of self-defence to ward off an unlawful attack. Acts which violate legally protected interests of innocent bystanders cannot be justified on grounds of self-defence. Under certain circumstances the perpetrators of such acts may go unpunished on the ground that the acts were justified by necessity (Notstand).      

####Re Article 19

1.  The request for a waiver of the primary right of the Federal Republic to exercise criminal jurisdiction provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 19 shall be made at the time of the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement by those of the sending States which have decided to make use of the waiver. The Federal Republic shall grant the waiver to these sending States when the Supplementary Agreement enters into force. If a sending State decides, after the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement, to make use of the waiver, the State concerned shall not request such waiver until agreement has been reached with the Federal Government on the necessary transitional arrangements.   
2.  

(a) Subject to a careful examination of each specific case and to the results of such examination, major interests of German administration of justice within the meaning of paragraph 3 of Article 19 may make imperative the exercise of German jurisdiction, in particular in the following cases: 

(i) offences within the competence of the Federal High Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in first and last instance or offences which may be prosecuted by the Chief Federal Prosecutor (Generalbundesanwalt) at the Federal High Court of Justice;  

(ii) offences causing the death of a human being, robbery, rape, except where these offences are directed against a member of a force or of a civilian component or a dependent;  

(iii) attempt to commit such offences or participation therein.    

(b) In respect of the offences referred to in sub-paragraph *(a)* of this paragraph the authorities concerned shall proceed in particularly close cooperation from the beginning of the preliminary investigations in order to provide the mutual assistance envisaged in paragraph 6 of Article VII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement.     

####Re Article 22

The sending States shall retain the right to keep in custody the arrested person either in a detention institution of their own or with their force. In order to ensure smooth implementation of the obligations imposed by the second sentence of paragraph 3 of Article 22, the authorities of the sending States shall keep the arrested person, where possible, in the vicinity of the seat of the German authority dealing with the case; this, however, shall not constitute an obligation on their part to keep the arrested person outside the area of the force.  

####Re Article 26, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (b)

The term “military exigency” may also apply to cases in which the offence was committed by a person temporarily present in the Federal territory for the purpose of training exercises or manoeuvres.  

####Re Article 31

1.  Articles 17 to 24 of the Hague Convention on Civil Procedure of 17 July 1905 shall in the relations between the Federal Republic and the French Republic, be considered to be an agreement within the meaning of Article 31, until such time as the Hague Convention on Civil Procedure of 1 March 1954 enters into force.   
2.  With respect to liability for breach of official duties, the following shall apply between the Federal Republic and the French Republic, as well as between the Federal Republic and the Kingdom of Belgium: The liability of the State (Federation or Land) or of a corporation existing under public law for damage suffered by a member of the Belgian force or of the French force, of their civilian components or by dependents as a result of a breach of official duties by German public servants in the Federal Republic shall be governed by the provisions applying to German nationals (Inländer).   

####Re Article 41

1.  Article 41 shall not be applicable to claims concerning damage arising under contracts or quasi-contractual relationships.   
2.  

(a) 

(i) In the case of damage to public roads and of damage to property of the Federal Republic, except property of the German Federal Railways and of the German Federal Post, caused by manoeuvres and other training exercises for which compensation would have been payable under Article 41, a force may, in lieu of paying such compensation, itself repair the damage.  

(ii) If a force wishes itself to repair damage to public roads, it will consult the competent German authorities and will refrain from itself carrying out the repair if the German authorities object for cogent technical building or traffic police control reasons. In these cases and in other cases of damages referred to in item (i) of this sub-paragraph contact shall not be necessary in individual cases if previously there has been an understanding on carrying out of repairs by the force on a general basis.    

(b) Nothing shall preclude a force itself making good the damage, in agreement with the person having suffered it, in cases other than those referred to in sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph.  

(c) In the cases referred to in sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of this paragraph, nothing shall preclude the person suffering the damage asserting any possible claim to which he may be entitled if in his opinion the damage has not been repaired either fully or properly.     
3.  In order to permit speedy settlement of compensation proceedings, a reasonable period of time should be provided within which to file compensation claims under Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement in conjunction with Article 41. To this end, the Federal Republic shall enact suitable legislation.   
4.  The waiver given by the Federal Republic in sub-paragraph *(a)* of paragraph 3 of Article 41 shall not apply to damage arising from non-fulfilment of the accepted responsibility for repair and maintenance. To the extent that the agreements (Überlassungsvereinbarungen) do not contain provisions for the settlement of such damage claims, the procedure for settling them shall be laid down in administrative agreements.   
5.  Insofar as property of juristic persons whose shares are in the hands of the Federation is made available free of charge to a force or a civilian component for exclusive use, the Federal Republic shall relieve the sending State of liability in respect of damages to this property to the same extent as the Federal Republic has waived, in accordance with sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 3 of Article 41, compensation for damage to property which it owns.   
6.  

(a) If in the cases referred to in the last sentence of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 3 and the last sentence of paragraph 5 of Article 41, there is a difference of opinion between the competent German authorities and the authorities of a force as to whether or not damage was caused wilfully or by gross negligence, the authorities on both sides shall enter into negotiations.  

(b) If a difference of opinion remains that cannot be resolved in further discussions between the parties at higher level, the arbitrator referred to in sub-paragraph *(a)* of paragraph 2 of Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall decide.     
7.  In respect of property owned by a Land and made available for use by a force (paragraph 4 of Article 41), the authorities of the force and the German authorities shall determine jointly the condition of such property as at the date of the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement. A similar determination shall be made at the time of the release of such property. Claims for damages or loss, if any, shall be settled on the basis of the condition of the property on these dates.   
8.  The American Red Cross and the University of Maryland shall not be deemed to be, nor be treated as, integral parts of the force for the purpose of paragraph 7 of Article 41 and in respect of the settlement of damage claims shall not be exempt from German jurisdiction.   
9.  The administrative agreements referred to in paragraph 13 of Article 41 may also contain arrangements which differ from the procedural arrangements contained in Article VIII of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement.   

####Re Article 47

The following language will be included in the administrative agreements envisaged in sub-paragraph (*g*) of paragraph 5 of Article 47: 

“In order to permit the German authorities to comply with the provisions of German budgetary law, it shall be certified in the written consent referred to in sub-paragraph (*c*) of paragraph 5 of Article 47 of the Supplementary Agreement that the necessary budgetary funds are available.”    

####Re Article 48

1.  

(a) Where in implementation of the third sentence of subparagraph (*c*) of paragraphs of Article 48 utilization contracts (Nutzungsverträge), toleration contracts (Duldungsverträge) or similar contracts are concluded, the German authorities shall agree upon the amount of compensation payable in consultation with the authorities of the force or the civilian component, except insofar as such compensation is to be borne by the Federal Republic under the provisions of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 5 of Article 63. The same shall apply where a unit of accommodation is requisitioned under the Land Procurement Law, to agreements regarding the amount of compensation payable in respect of anticipatory possession (Besitzeinweisungsentschädigung) or any other compensation. The provisions of article 63 shall remain unaffected.  

(b) The procedure envisaged in sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 1 shall be applied *mutatis mutandis* when under the Restricted Areas Law or the Air Traffic Law utilization contracts, toleration contracts or similar contracts are concluded in the interests of a force, or when agreements are concluded on the amount of compensation payable in respect of restricted areas (Schutzbereichentschädigungen).     
2.  With respect to paragraph 2 of Article 48 and without prejudice to the arrangements set forth in sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of paragraph 5 of that Article, the authorities of a sending State shall in special cases, at the request of the Federal Government, enter into negotiations for the release or exchange of accommodation which was in the possession of a force or a civilian component at noon on 5 May 1955, in order to take into account essential German civilian interests and in particular the exigencies of town and country planning (Raumordnung und Städtebau), nature preservation, and farming and economic interests. The authorities of the sending State shall in this give sympathetic consideration to requests by the Federal Government.   
3.  With respect to paragraph 2 and sub-paragraph (*c*) of paragraph 5 of Article 48, the following shall apply: In order to avoid difficulties in cases in which, in respect of accommodation made available to a force or to a civilian component for use, the legal relationship with the owner or other entitled person ends, and in order to facilitate the implementation by the Federal Republic of the undertaking set forth in the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 48, the German authorities and the authorities of the force shall maintain constant and close contact with each other. The authorities of the force shall inform the German authorities as early as possible if in such a case there is a continuing accommodation requirement beyond the date on which the legal relationship ends. In order that the authorities of the force will be able so to state, the German authorities shall as early as possible, and to the extent necessary, inform the authorities of the force that the legal relationship with the owner or other entitled person will lapse, and when; this shall apply especially in cases where the legal relationship ends otherwise than by expiration of a lease or rent contract.   
4.  The details with regard to the use of accommodation referred to in the first sentence of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 3 of Article 48 shall be taken to mean, in particular, duration of availability, utilization, responsibility for repairs, maintenance, and traffic safety measures, as well as any financial arrangements which may be necessary within the framework of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement.   
5.  

(a) In the agreements required under sub-paragraph (*b*) of paragraph 3 of Article 48 the data on the equipment of the accommodation legally owned by the Federation or a Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) - except accommodation of the German Federal Railways or German Federal Post - shall cover only those objects, the removal of which under Article 50 requires the consent of, or prior notification to, the German authorities. The state of preservation of accommodation shall, at the request of the authorities of the force concerned, be expressed in general terms, such as “good”, “moderate”, or “bad”.  

(b) Further procedural and technical details shall, to the extent necessary, be governed by administrative agreement.     
6.  The obligation under paragraph 4 of Article 48 to carry out repair and maintenance shall not include the reconstruction of a building wholly or largely destroyed by act of God.   
7.  The negotiations which in application of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 5 of Article 48 take place between the authorities of a force and the German authorities concerning the question of whether alternative accommodation offered by the Federal Republic satisfies the requirements of the force or the civilian component, shall extend, as far as necessary, to financial questions arising in this connection.   

####Re Article 50

1.  Nothing in Article 50 shall be construed to mean that the removal from one unit of accommodation to another of fixtures fittings and furnishings which are not owned by the Federation is admissible without the owner's consent.   
2.  In cases where the building records are no longer available, the authorities of the force or of the civilian component and the German authorities shall jointly determine, in accordance with criteria applicable to buildings of the same type, which articles fall within the purview of subparagraph (*a*) of Article 50.   

####Re Article 51

1.  If it is uneconomical to return an article to the Federal territory, for instance if transportation costs exceed its value, agreement to the sale of such article abroad shall be given by the German authorities.   
2.  The removal from the Federal territory to Berlin (West) of movable property procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds for use by the Armed Forces of the sending State shall not be regarded as removal from the Federal territory within the meaning of Article 51. Property removed to Berlin (West) shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 und 2 thereof. Its further removal elsewhere, except its return to the Federal territory, shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 thereof.   
3.  Notwithstanding the special status enjoyed by the Saarland during the transitional period provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 1 and in Article 3 of the Treaty between the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the Settlement of the Saar Question, dated 27 October 1956, in the field of customs, taxes and foreign currency, the provisions of Article 51 shall apply to movable property procured from occupation costs, mandatory expenditures or support costs funds, located in the Saarland, as well as to its removal from the Saarland to places outside the Federal Republic. The provisions of Article 51 shall, until the expiry of the transitional period referred to in this paragraph, apply *mutatis mutandis* to the removal of such property from other parts of the Federal territory to the Saarland.   
4.  The words “necessary to the fulfilment of the defence mission of NATO” contained in paragraph 3 of Article 51 shall not be construed as calling for a specific NATO directive.   
5.  Registration contracts in respect of railway cars concluded under paragraph 2 of Article 57 of the Supplementary Agreement shall, unless it is otherwise agreed, remain effective even if such railway cars are removed from the Federal territory pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 51.   
6.  The agreements specified in paragraph 4 of Article 51 shall be concluded in the spirit of the mutual aid envisaged by Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty.   

####Re Article 52

In reaching agreement on residual value, the German authorities shall base their position on the military or economic use which the relinquished improvements, equipment, or supplies have for these authorities themselves, or on the net proceeds of sale, if any.  

####Re Article 53

1.  Unless otherwise provided, a force shall not be entitled to exploit for economic benefit accommodation made available for its use.   
2.  Exploitation by the person entitled thereto shall be restricted only to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose stated in the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 53.   
3.  The term “restricted area” (Schutzbereich) shall be interpreted in accordance with its meaning in German law. The term “appropriate measures” within the meaning of paragraph 6 of Article 53 shall be construed to mean only such measures as can be taken by the German authorities within their legal powers.   
4.  Should German legislation implementing Article 53 prove insufficient to ensure that the defence responsibilities of a force can be satisfactorily fulfilled, the German authorities and the authorities of the force shall discuss the desirability or necessity of seeking amendment to such legislation.   
5.  Co-operation between the authorities of a force and the German authorities with regard to the administration of property made or to be made available by the Federal Republic to the force for its use shall extend in particular to the following fields: 

(a) determination of land boundaries, production of site plans and survey documents of plots of land;  

(b) drawing up of property lists and inventories, valuation of such property;  

(c) public safety and order, including fire precautions, prevention of accidents and safety measures, such as those pertaining to rifle ranges, ammunition depots, fuel depots and dangerous plants;  

(d) health and sanitation (as provided for in Article 54);  

(e) industrial inspection;  

(f) water, gas and electricity supply, drainage, and sewage disposal;  

(g) property restrictions, protection of neighbouring property, town and country planning, protection of monuments and sanctuaries;  

(h) basic preservation of land and buildings;  

(i) water, power and heating plants, where these serve not only the force but also German agencies or the civilian population;  

(k) use of land and buildings by the civilian population or German authorities for business, agricultural or residential purposes;  

(l) forestry operations, hunting, shooting and fishing;  

(m) exploitation of mineral deposits;  

(n) traffic precautions, as well as maintenance and cleaning of roads open to the public traffic;  

(o) operation and maintenance of railway connections;  

(p) telecommunications.     
6.  Co-operation between the authorities of a force and the German authorities shall be carried out in accordance with the following procedures: 

(a) The authorities of the force and the German authorities shall designate representatives for a unit or units of accommodation. The representatives of the force and the German representatives shall co-operate to ensure that due consideration is given to the interests of the force and to German interests. They shall agree on such measures as may be necessary for implementing co-operation.  

(b) The military commander responsible for the accommodation or other appropriate authority of the force shall give the German representatives and the experts nominated by them all reasonable assistance necessary to safeguard the German interests, including access to accommodation, subject in all cases to considerations of military security.  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraphs *(a)* and *(b)* of this paragraph, the following procedure shall apply: 

(i) The property lists and inventories of property referred to in sub-paragraph *(b)* of paragraph 5 of this Section shall normally be set up or checked at the beginning and the end of the period for which a unit of accommodation is made available to the force for its use.  

(ii) Co-operation in the field of safety measures in respect of rifle ranges, ammunition depots and fuel depots shall normally be effected through joint commissions. Details of such procedure shall be laid down in administrative agreements.       
7.  Where provisions of the Supplementary Agreement or special NATO regulations prescribe for certain accommodation a different procedure for co-operation in the fields referred to in paragraphs 5 of this Section, such provisions or regulations shall prevail.   

####Re Article 54, paragraph 1

In cases where it is legally or technically impossible for a force or a civilian component to comply in detail with a German health regulation, the German authorities and the authorities of the force shall agree without delay on other means of meeting the object of the regulation.  

####Re Article 56, paragraph 9

1.  The individual administrative units and establishments (Betriebe) of a force or of a civilian component as defined by the force concerned shall be agencies within the meaning of the Personnel Representation Law (Personalvertretungsgesetz) of 5 August 1955 (Bundesgesetzblatt Teil I, page 477), referred to in this Section as “the Law”. Those headquarters which are administratively immediately subordinate to the highest authority of a force and to which other agencies are administratively subordinate shall be the intermediate authorities.   
2.  There shall be no joint works councils (Gesamtbetriebsräte). Works councils above the local level (Stufenvertretungen) shall only be established at the level of the intermediate authorities as district works councils; the maximum number of their members shall be eleven. In the case of duty travel performed by the members of a district works council, travelling expenses shall be paid pursuant to the tariff provisions governing travelling expenses for salaried civilian employees of the force but at not less than the second highest rate.   
3.  In discussions with the works council, the head of the agency may be represented by a person holding a responsible position in the management of the agency. The head of the agency shall not be required to appoint the electoral committee for the election of the local works council. Applications by the Trade Unions for the convening of staff assemblies for the purpose of electing the electoral committee shall be submitted in writing.   
4.  The period of employment with the agency, required to establish eligibility for election to the works council, shall be one year.   
5.  The period of office of works councils shall be one year.   
6.  The head of the agency shall not be required to submit to the members of the works council such documents as are classified for security reasons. For the same reasons, and in accordance with special directives issued by the highest authority of the force, a member of the works council may be restricted in his right of access to agencies of the force; the same shall apply to other persons who, according to the provisions of the Law, may participate in the meetings of the works council.   
7.  In those cases where the provisions of the Law envisage rights to co-determination, the co-operation procedure (Mitwirkungsverfahren) shall apply. Works agreements (Dienstvereinbarungen) may be concluded on the basis of a freely negotiated settlement, if they are admissible in accordance with the Law, and if the head of the agency is authorized to conclude such agreement. The provisions of the Law concerning the reasons for denying the approval of upgrading, downgrading and transfer shall not apply.   
8.  Insofar as it is incompatible with the fulfilment of the defence responsibilities of the force, the head of the agency shall not be required to submit to or discuss with the works council any draft of administrative instructions prior to their being issued. In the case of investigations into accidents the works council shall be called in unless regulations regarding military security or discipline exclude the presence of works council members.   
9.  The works council shall co-operate in all measures concerning medical and health service for the employees, except in the appointment of medical doctors.   
10.  Where the Law provides for court decisions, the German Labour Courts shall decide cases in accordance with the procedure provided for in German law (Beschlussverfahren), and the Federal Republic shall act in the proceedings in the name of a force or a civilian component at their request.   
11.  At the request of a force or a civilian component, the agency designated by the Federal Republic shall apply for the institution of a criminal prosecution in respect of a breach of secrecy (Verletzung der Schweigepflicht) in accordance with the penal provisions of the Law.   
12.  The period of office of duly elected works councils existing at the date of entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement shall terminate not later than six months after that date.   

####Re Article 57, paragraph 3

During the thaw period any special road signs erected by the German authorities or special orders issued by the latter shall be observed except in cases of accidents, catastrophes or a state of emergency.  

####Re Article 58

The limited use, by the military transport services of a force, of specialized internal telephone systems operated by German agencies may be continued, subject to the conclusion of administrative agreements, provided that 

(a) the number of existing extensions shall not be increased;  

(b) this number shall be jointly reviewed immediately after the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement, and shall be reduced as far as possible;  

(c) by mutual agreement the number of extensions shall subsequently be progressively reduced and these extensions finally discontinued as and when the technical development of the public telephone system or of an alternative military system renders such exceptional use unnecessary.    

####Re Article 60

1.  If the German Federal Post intends to amend the regulations on the use of telecommunication facilities referred to in the second sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 60 or to introduce new regulations on such use, and a force will be affected thereby, the force shall be informed at the earliest possible date and in no case later than one month prior to the entry into force of the regulations in question, in order that any necessary consultations may take place. The force shall be allowed sufficient time to make any changes in telecommunication facilities or administrative procedure required thereby.   
2.  Aeronautical and meteorological services fall within the category of radio services referred to in sub-paragraphs (*b*) and *(c)* of paragraph 2 of Article 60.   
3.  

(a) Sub-paragraph (*b*) of paragraph of Article 60 refers to telecommunication facilities whose installation is not otherwise authorized under that Article.  

(b) Where the period of six months stipulated in sub-paragraph of paragraph 4 of Article 60 is exceeded due to factors beyond the control of the force or the implementing agency (e.g. strikes or lack of material), a special agreement covering the extension of such period of time shall be concluded. Telecommunication facilities of the force the establishment of which the German Federal Post has contracted prior to the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement shall not be deemed subject to such period of six months. Such facilities may be taken into use at any time subsequent to the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement.     
4.  The right mentioned in sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph of Article 60 to set up and operate sound and television broadcasting stations does not affect the question of copyright.   
5.  

(a) A force shall use only the frequencies assigned to it by the German authorities. Assignments of frequencies made prior to the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement shall remain valid. The authorities of the force shall notify the German authorities of frequencies no longer required. If, by reason of international obligations, international relations, or essential German interests, the German authorities deem it necessary to change or withdraw a frequency assignment, they shall, before doing so, consult the authorities of the force.  

(b) The procedure for the assignment of frequencies, for changes or withdrawals of frequencies already assigned and for an accelerated assignment of frequencies for temporary use in manoeuvres shall be laid down by special agreement between the German authorities and the authorities of a force. Such agreement shall be in accordance with relevant NATO procedures, directives and recommendations.  

(c) Measures for the protection of frequencies through the competent NATO authority shall be initiated by the force concerned. Measures for the protection of frequencies through other international organizations, especially through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), shall be initiated by the German authorities only at the request of the authorities of the force concerned.  

(d) Information on frequencies used by a force shall be transmitted to other agencies and organizations only with the consent of the authorities of the force.  

(e) Where radio stations of a force cause harmful interference to radio stations located outside the Federal territory, or suffer harmful interference from such stations, the German authorities shall proceed in accordance with the International Telecommunication Convention in force at the time and its pertinent Radio Regulations, except where special agreements have been concluded with the sending State operating the radio stations concerned in the Federal territory.  

(f) A force shall be bound by the provisions contained in Appendices 3 and 4 of the Radio Regulations of Atlantic City 1947 or by such provisions as may replace them only insofar as this can reasonably be expected in the fulfilment of its defence responsibilities.     
6.  

(a) In addition to the international instruments referred to in paragraph 8 of Article 60, a force shall observe equally the provisions of the following international instruments which the Federal Republic while not a party thereto applies in its territory: 

(i) European Regional Convention for the Maritime Mobile Radio Service, Copenhagen, 1948;  

(ii) Frequency Allocation Plan for the Aeronautical Mobile Service and Final Act, Geneva, 1948/49;  

(iii) Final Acts of the Extraordinary Administrative Radio Conference, Geneva, 1951;  

(iv) Special Arrangements Concerning Radio Beacons in the European Zone of Region I, Paris, 1951.    

(b) Subject to prior agreement between a force and the German authorities the force shall also observe the provisions of any other new international instruments in the field of telecommunications to which the Federal Republic is not a party, to the extent that the Federal Republic applies such provisions in its territory. Except for compelling military reasons the force shall not object to the application of the provisions of instruments of this kind.  

(c) The German authorities shall give due consideration to the requirements of a force insofar as the Federal Republic applies in its own territory international instruments in the field of telecommunications to which it is not a party.  

(d) Sub-paragraphs (*a*) to (*c*) of this paragraph shall, however, apply on the understanding that a force is not bound by the provisions of the instruments referred to therein to the extent that the German Armed Forces are exempt from them under domestic German regulations.     

####Re Article 63

1.  The arrangements set forth in Article 63 shall not exclude the possibility of agreements being concluded on financial matters during discussions or negotiations which are envisaged in the Supplementary Agreement or in the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and in which financial matters play a part.   
2.  Property and services used by or rendered to a force or to a civilian component without charge in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 and sub-paragraph (*a*) and (*b*) of paragraph 4 of Article 63 may be officially made available by the force or by the civilian component to the dependents of the members of the force or of the civilian component in the same way as they may be officially made available to such members themselves.   
3.  Services rendered by the German Armed Forces in the meteorological, topographical, and cartographical fields shall be reserved to special arrangements.   
4.  Property legally owned by the Federation or by a Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) shall not be deemed to include property owned by other juristic persons even though their shares are held by the Federation or by a Land.   
5.  The Federal Republic is prepared to ensure under special agreements to be concluded in individual cases that certain property owned by juristic persons whose shares are held by the Federation or by a Land shall be made available to a force or to a civilian component for use without any obligation on their part to pay rental therefor.   
6.  Property within the meaning of sub-paragraphs (*a*) and (*b*) of paragraph 4 of Article 63 may be transferred by a force or a civilian component to another force or another civilian component only with the consent of the German authorities.   
7.  

(a) If it is so agreed between the German authorities and the authorities of a force, payment shall be made for the use of property acquired by the Federation after the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement for purposes other than defence.  

(b) If it is so agreed between the German authorities and the authorities of a force, the sending State shall not be relieved from liability for any possible claims which may be due to a Land under German law in respect of the use of property acquired by the Land after the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement for purposes other than defence.     
8.  Other operating costs within the meaning of sub-paragraph (*d*) of paragraph 4 of Article 63 also include the following: 

(a) the cost of 

(i) cleaning and strewing roads, pavements, and access ways;  

(ii) sewage and garbage disposal;  

(iii) drainage;  

(iv) chimney sweeping;  

(v) compulsory insurance against fire and other damage to property; insofar as there is obligation under German law to meet such cost;    

(b) where applicable, the cost of 

(i) supply of electricity, gas, water, heat, and fuel, whether made available together with the property or separately obtained direct from the appropriate public supply services;  

(ii) operation of lifts;  

(iii) cleaning and disinfestation;  

(iv) upkeep of gardens;  

(v) employment of caretaker.       
9.  In view of the fact that payment by a force of current public charges on property and of other operating costs may in some cases involve direct payment to the supplier of the services concerned (some of wich services are separately payable under German law and are not covered, or are not fully covered, by the current public charges on property) and in other cases reimbursement to the Federal Republic, arrangements shall to the extent necessary be made to make sure that there is no duplication of payment for the same service.   
10.  The arrangement set forth in sub-paragraph (*d*) of paragraph 4 of Article 63 and in paragraph 8 of this Section shall not exclude negotiations between the authorities of the force and the local German authorities with a view to obtaining exemption from fees where such services are performed by the force itself instead of by the competent German agencies,   
11.  As far as accommodation is concerned, the expression “cost of repairs and maintenance” contained in item (i) of sub-paragraph *(d)* of paragraph 4 of Article 63 shall mean costs arising from the repair and maintenance work referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 48 and in paragraph 6 of the Section of the Protocol of Signature referring to that Article.   
12.  Compensation payable under the Land Procurement Law (item (i) of sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 5 of Article 63) includes the payments to be made in the case of procurement by free negotiation, in particular, the purchase price and rental.   

####Re Article 68

1.  

(a) If a new German tax, which is created after the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement and which is not merely an extension of an existing German tax, is applicable to members of a force or of a civilian component or to dependents under the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement and is directly payable by them in accordance with German tax legislation, the Federal Government shall, upon request, carefully examine whether and to what extent such tax is to be paid by such persons. In this, the Federal Government shall, in particular, be guided by the endeavour to avoid any burdens on members of a force of a civilian component or on dependents that appear unjustified in the light of the purpose and the special conditions of their presence in the Federal Republic.  

(b) The same procedure shall apply if any tax existing at the time of the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement but not contained in the list set forth in paragraph 2 of this Section is applicable to members of a force or of a civilian component or to dependents under the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement and is directly payable by them in accordance with German tax legislation.  

(c) The list set forth in paragraph 2 of this Section specifies existing Federal and Land taxes and all other taxes known to the Federal Government at the time of the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement that are applicable to members of a force or of a civilian component or to dependents under the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement and are directly payable by them in accordance with German tax legislation. In general, the list does not include the indirect taxes which might be reflected in the price of goods and services and from which members of a force or of a civilian component or dependents are not exempte.; The explanations accompanying some of the taxes contained in the list summarize the circumstances under which these taxes are applicable.  

(d) Tax relief for members of the German Armed Forces and their dependents does not exist under present German law and such relief is not envisaged for the future. Should such tax relief, however, be granted, the Federal Government shall endeavour to extend its application to members of the forces and of the civilian components and to dependents.     
2.   *List of German Taxes*  

(a)  *Taxes on Income*  Einkommensteuer, Lohnsteuer, Kapitalertragsteuer, Aufsichtsratsteuer, Steuerabzug von Einkünften bei beschränkt Steuerpflichtigen.

(b)  *Taxes on Property or on Ownership of Property*  Vermögensteuer, Grundsteuer, Rentenbankgrundschuldzinsen, Kirchensteuer. Tax is imposed only with respect to internal property, i.e., in general, property within the Federal Republic, except movable property which is in the Federal Republic for no reason other than that the member of a force or of a civilian component or the dependent is temporarily present in the Federal Republic.  

(c)  *Tax on Inheritance and Gifts*  Erbschaftsteuer. Tax is imposed only on internal property (within the meaning of sub-paragraph (*b*) of this paragraph), except movable property which is in the Federal Republic for no reason other than that the member of a force or of a civilian component or the dependent is temporarily present in the Federal Republic, or on the usufruct value of such property, acquired by way of inheritance or gift. If the deceased at the time of his death, or the donor at the time the gift was made, had their domicile or habitual residence (within the meaning of the tax laws) in the Federal Republic, the tax will be assessed on the basis of the total value of the inheritance or gift.  

(d)  *Transfer and Traffic Taxes*  Kapitalverkehrsteuern, Wechselsteuer, Beförderungsteuer, Versicherungsteuer, Grunderwerbsteuer (und Überpreis), Wertzuwachssteuer, Kraftfahrzeugsteuer.

The concept of “enterpriser” (Unternehmer) covers the independent exercise of commercial or professional activities, i.e., any continuous activity designed to realize proceeds (Einnahmen), even if the intention to gain profit is absent. The concept of “turnover” (Umsatz) covers internal deliveries and services rendered within the Federal territory by an enterpriser against remuneration within the framework of his enterprise.

### Artikel  3  

1.  In overeenstemming met de krachtens het Noordatlantische Verdrag op de partijen bij dat Verdrag rustende verplichtingen om elkaar hulp te verlenen, werken de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmachten nauw samen ter verzekering van de uitvoering van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van deze Overeenkomst.   
2.  De samenwerking als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel strekt zich in het bijzonder uit 

a) tot de bevordering en de waarborging van de veiligheid van de Bondsrepubliek, van de staten van herkomst en van de krijgsmachten, alsmede tot de bescherming van hun eigendommen, en met name tot het verzamelen, uitwisselen en beveiligen van alle inlichtingen die voor deze doeleinden van belang zijn;  

b) tot de bevordering en waarborging van de veiligheid van Duitsers, van leden van de krijgsmachten, van leden van de civiele diensten en gezinsleden en van niet tot deze categorieën behorende onderdanen van de staten van herkomst, alsmede tot de bescherming van hun eigendommen.     
3.  In het kader van de in het eerste en tweede lid bedoelde samenwerking verzekeren de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht door het nemen van passende maatregelen een nauw en wederkerig contact.   
4.  De Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst nemen alle administratieve maatregelen die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van deze Overeenkomst en sluiten te dien einde, indien nodig, administratieve of andere overeenkomsten.   
5.  

a) Bij de uitvoering van de bepalingen op het gebied van de verzorging, neergelegd in het NAVO-Status Verdrag en in deze Overeenkomst, kennen de Duitse autoriteiten een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst een zodanige behandeling toe als nodig is voor een bevredigende vervulling van hun taak ten aanzien van de verdediging.  

b) Bij het doen gelden van de rechten die hun krachtens de onder *a* bedoelde regelingen zijn toegekend houden de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst, teneinde te geraken tot een redelijke afweging van hun behoeften en die van de Bondsrepubliek, met de Duitse openbare en particuliere belangen naar behoren rekening.     
6.  De Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht wijzen gemeenschappelijk grensoverschrijdingsposten aan, waar liaison-personeel van de staat van herkomst zal worden gestationeerd. Dit personeel staat de Duitse autoriteiten bij in hun controlewerkzaamheden ter verzekering van de snelle en ongehinderde doortocht van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden en hun medegevoerde bagage, alsmede van goederen en materialen die door de krijgsmacht of te haren behoeve of voor haar rekening ten gebruike door de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden worden verzonden.   
7.  Indien bij de uitvoering van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst noch op plaatselijk, noch op regionaal niveau tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht overeenstemming wordt bereikt, wordt de zaak, tenzij het NAVO-Status Verdrag of deze Overeenkomst een bijzondere procedure voorschrijft, verwezen naar de bevoegde hoogste autoriteit van de Bondsrepubliek en de hogere autoriteit van de krijgsmacht. De Bondsregering of de hogere autoriteit van de krijgsmacht verstrekt onderscheidenlijk aan de Duitse autoriteiten of aan de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de civiele dienst alle in dat geval eventueel nodige instructies.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  De uitoefening van rechten en de vervulling van verplichtingen door een staat van herkomst ingevolge het NAVO-Status Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst kunnen met toestemming van de Bondsregering plaatsvinden door andere staten van herkomst, in overeenstemming met tussen de betrokken staten van herkomst te sluiten administratieve overeenkomsten.   
2.  Tot aan de inwerkingtreding van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde administratieve overeenkomsten blijven de overeenkomsten tussen de betrokken staten van herkomst die de uitoefening van rechten en de vervulling van verplichtingen op het tijdstip van de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst beheersen, van toepassing op de gebieden waarop zij betrekking hebben, tenzij de betrokken staat van herkomst de andere betrokken staat van herkomst en de Bondsrepubliek in kennis stelt van zijn voornemen de laatstgenoemde overeenkomsten niet langer toe te passen.   

### Artikel  5  

1.  Met betrekking tot de legitimatieplicht op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek gelden de volgende bepalingen: 

a) Leden van een krijgsmacht behoeven geen reiswijzer te hebben.  

b) In uniform geklede leden van een krijgsmacht die zich in het verband van een onderdeel onder militair commando verplaatsen, behoeven hun identiteit niet te bewijzen. Indien het bij uitzondering noodzakelijk is onmiddellijk de identiteit van een eenheid vast te stellen, toont de commandant van de eenheid op verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten zijn persoonlijk identiteitsbewijs.  

c) Leden van een civiele dienst en gezinsleden die geen paspoort of een naar Duits recht gelijkwaardig document bij zich hebben, bewijzen hun identiteit door middel van een door de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst afgegeven identiteitsbewijs, waarop voorkomen de naam, de geboortedatum en een foto van de houder, een volgnummer of de aanduiding van de autoriteit die het bewijs heeft afgegeven en de hoedanigheid waarin de houder op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek verblijft.  

d) Indien bij uitzondering een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid niet in het bezit is van de documenten bedoeld in artikel III van het NAVO-Status Verdrag of in dit artikel, nemen de Duitse autoriteiten genoegen met een tijdelijke schriftelijke verklaring van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, volgens welke de betrokken persoon een lid van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst of een gezinslid is.   De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht vervangen een zodanige verklaring zo spoedig mogelijk door de documenten, bedoeld in artikel III van het NAVO-Status Verdrag of in dit artikel en stellen de Duitse autoriteiten daarvan op de hoogte.   
2.  Met betrekking tot grensoverschrijdingen gelden de volgende bepalingen: 

a) Individuele of collectieve reiswijzers behelzen als regel in het Duits de gegevens bedoeld in artikel III, tweede lid, onder *b* in het NAVO-Status Verdrag. Reiswijzers waarin bij uitzondering deze gegevens niet in het Duits vermeld staan, worden niettemin door de Duitse autoriteiten als geldig erkend. Reiswijzers worden afgegeven voor één in- of uitreis of voor beide, of zijn geldig gedurende een beperkte periode. De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen de geldigheidsduur van een reiswijzer verlengen. De individuele reiswijzer kan worden vervangen door een op het persoonlijke identiteitsbewijs gestelde aantekening die de datum aangeeft waarop de geldigheid afloopt.  

b) De identiteit van een onderdeel dat de grens op een collectieve reiswijzer onder militair commando overschrijdt, wordt aangetoond door zijn commandant die zijn persoonlijk identiteitsbewijs en de collectieve reiswijzer overlegt. Indien de Duitse autoriteiten het bij uitzondering, in verband met bijzondere redenen die door het Duitse grenscontrolepersoneel aan de commandant van de eenheid worden medegedeeld, nodig achten de identiteit van bepaalde leden van een eenheid vast te stellen, legt de commandant van de eenheid de persoonlijke identiteitsbewijzen van die leden over. Dit onderzoek mag voor de eenheid geen aanmerkelijke vertraging ten gevolge hebben.  

c) De controle van identiteitsbewijzen bij binnenkomst of vertrek via militaire vliegvelden van een krijgsmacht is in beginsel gelijk aan de grenscontrole bij grensoverschrijdingen over land. Bij binnenkomst of vertrek via militaire vliegvelden van leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of gezinsleden volstaan de Duitse autoriteiten echter met steekproeven die plaatsvinden na overleg met de autoriteiten van het betrokken vliegveld; een regelmatige controle van de identiteit van zulke personen wordt uitgevoerd door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht. De controle van de identiteitsbewijzen van personen niet behorend tot de categorieën bedoeld in de vorige volzin, die het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek binnenkomen of verlaten via militaire vliegvelden van een krijgsmacht, wordt uitgevoerd door de Duitse autoriteiten, die door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht op de hoogte worden gesteld van de aankomst van die personen. Deze controle vindt plaats bij het betreden of het verlaten van het vliegveld.     

### Artikel  6  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst en gezinsleden zijn niet onderworpen aan de Duitse voorschriften op het gebied van de aanmelding (Meldewesen) en de vreemdelingencontrole (Ausländerpolizei), behalve met betrekking tot de inschrijving in hotels en soortgelijke inrichtingen (Beherbergungsstätten).   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht houden tot op de dag bijgewerkte lijsten aan van alle leden van de civiele dienst en van alle gezinsleden. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht verstrekken de Duitse autoriteiten op een met redenen omkleed verzoek van die autoriteiten in bijzondere gevallen de inlichtingen die vereist zijn ingevolge de in het eerste lid bedoelde voorschriften.   
3.  De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht delen de Duitse autoriteiten op hun verzoek het aantal leden van de civiele dienst en het aantal gezinsleden mede.   

### Artikel  7  

Bij toepassing van internationale overeenkomsten of andere op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde regelingen betreffende verblijf (Aufenthalt) en vestiging (Niederlassung), voorzover zij betrekking hebben op repatriëring, uitwijzing, verlenging van verblijfsvergunningen of de uitoefening van een beroep, wordt de tijd, doorgebracht op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek als lid van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of als gezinslid, buiten beschouwing gelaten.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  Indien een bevoegde Duitse autoriteit voornemens is een van de maatregelen te nemen, waartoe een staat van verblijf bevoegd is ingevolge artikel III, vijfde lid, eerste volzin van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, stelt die autoriteit de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken staat van herkomst van dit voornemen in kennis, onder mededeling van de redenen waarop de voorgenomen maatregel is gebaseerd en stelt die autoriteit in de gelegenheid binnen een redelijke termijn haar mening hierover kenbaar te maken dan wel zelf de maatregelen te nemen die zij gepast acht. De Duitse autoriteiten nemen het eventueel door de staat van herkomst ingenomen standpunt en de eventueel door de autoriteiten van die staat genomen maatregelen in welwillende overweging.   
2.  De kennisgeving van het voornemen tot het nemen van een van de maatregelen, bedoeld in artikel III, vijfde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, wordt gedaan door de Minister van Binnenlandse Zaken van het betrokken Land of, indien het Hamburg en Bremen betreft, door de Senator voor Binnenlandse Zaken (Senator für innere Angelegenheiten).   
3.  Verzoeken om verwijderingen en uitwijzingsbevelen worden slechts gedaan, onderscheidenlijk gegeven, indien de bevoegde Duitse autoriteit van mening is, dat op het tijdstip dat het verzoek of het bevel wordt gedaan, onderscheidenlijk gegeven, het verdere verblijf van de betrokken persoon op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek de openbare orde of veiligheid daadwerkelijk in gevaar brengt.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Een bewijs of andere machtiging, afgegeven door een autoriteit van een staat van herkomst aan een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, op grond waarvan de houder bevoegd is dienstvoertuigen, -vaartuigen of -luchtvaartuigen te besturen, is geldig voor het besturen van die voertuigen, vaartuigen of luchtvaartuigen binnen het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek.   
2.  De houder van een rijbewijs, afgegeven in een staat van herkomst, op grond waarvan de houder bevoegd is particuliere motorvoertuigen in die staat te besturen, is bevoegd tot het besturen van zodanige voertuigen op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek, indien hij lid is van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, of een gezinslid is. De Duitse voorschriften betreffende de geldigheidsduur van een zodanig rijbewijs op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek en de ongeldigverklaring ervan door een Duitse administratieve autoriteit zijn niet van toepassing, indien de houder in het bezit is van een verklaring, afgegeven door een autoriteit van de krijgsmacht, waaruit blijkt dat hij lid is van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst dan wel een gezinslid is en dat hij voldoende kennis bezit van de Duitse verkeersvoorschriften. Deze verklaring wordt voorzien van een Duitse vertaling.   
3.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen aan leden van de krijgsmacht en de civiele dienst en aan gezinsleden rijbewijzen - voorzien van een Duitse vertaling - afgeven voor het besturen van particuliere motorrijtuigen, nadat deze autoriteiten zich ervan hebben overtuigd, dat de betrokkenen niet alleen de geschiktheid tot het besturen van motorvoertuigen, doch ook voldoende kennis van de Duitse verkeersvoorschriften bezitten. Zij zien erop toe, dat leerling-bestuurders worden onderricht door een persoon die voldoet aan de voorwaarden, bedoeld in de eerste volzin van dit lid en in het bezit is van een geldig rijbewijs en dat zij wanneer zij op een openbare weg rijden te allen tijde door een zodanige persoon worden vergezeld. Deze is verantwoordelijk voor de besturing van het voertuig en moet in het bezit zijn van een schriftelijke verklaring, afgegeven door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en voorzien van een Duitse vertaling, die hem bevoegd verklaart de leerling-bestuurder les te geven.   
4.  Een burgervliegbrevet, afgegeven door de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst aan een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of aan een gezinslid, machtigt de houder binnen de Bondsrepubliek particuliere luchtvaartuigen te besturen indien dit brevet beantwoordt aan de Normen en Aanbevolen Werkwijzen van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.   
5.  

a) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht zien erop toe dat personen die dienstvaartuigen besturen als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, bij het bevaren van binnenwateren voldoende kennis bezitten van het te bevaren traject en van de terzake geldende rivierpolitiereglementen.  

b) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen bewijzen van bekwaamheid afgeven voor de besturing van andere dan dienst-binnenvaartuigen van de krijgsmacht nadat zij zich er van hebben overtuigd, dat de aanvrager de in dit lid onder *a* voorgeschreven kennis bezit. De wateren welke mogen worden bevaren worden in het bewijs aangegeven. De in het kader van internationale overeenkomsten toepasselijke voorschriften blijven onverminderd van kracht.     
6.  

a) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht trekken rijbewijzen die op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek geldig zijn ingevolge het eerste en het derde lid van dit artikel, of bewijzen bedoeld in het tweede lid, in, indien er gerede twijfel bestaat aangaande de betrouwbaarheid of de geschiktheid van de houder voor het besturen van een motorvoertuig. Zij nemen verzoeken van de Duitse autoriteiten om intrekking van zulke rijbewijzen of bewijzen in welwillende overweging. Rijbewijzen of bewijzen kunnen opnieuw worden afgegeven wegens dringende militaire redenen of om de houder in de gelegenheid te stellen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek te verlaten. De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht stellen de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van iedere intrekking op grond van deze alinea en van ieder geval waarin na een zodanige intrekking een rijbewijs of bewijs opnieuw is afgegeven.  

b) In de gevallen waarin Duitse rechtbanken rechtsmacht uitoefenen op grond van artikel VII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de artikelen 17, 18 en 19 van deze Overeenkomst blijven de bepalingen van de Duitse strafwetgeving inzake de intrekking van de bevoegdheid van toepassing met betrekking tot rijbewijzen bedoeld in het tweede en het derde lid van dit artikel. Van de intrekking van de rijbevoegdheid wordt melding gemaakt in het rijbewijs, dat in het bezit van de houder wordt gelaten.     
7.  

a) Alinea *a* van het zesde lid van dit artikel is van overeenkomstige toepassing op vliegbrevetten en bewijzen van bekwaamheid als bedoeld in het vierde lid en alinea *b* van het vijfde lid.  

b) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht nemen rapporten van de Duitse autoriteiten omtrent het niet in acht nemen van luchtverkeersvoorschriften door houders van vliegbrevetten die ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek geldig zijn in welwillende overweging en nemen de noodzakelijke maatregelen.     

### Artikel  10  

1.  Motorrijtuigen en aanhangwagens van motorrijtuigen van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, van leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden kunnen door de autoriteiten van die krijgsmacht worden geregistreerd en toegelaten. Met inachtneming van de in het kader van internationale overeenkomsten toepasselijke voorschriften geldt hetzelfde ten aanzien van vaartuigen van een krijgsmacht. Luchtvaartuigen van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, van leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, of van gezinsleden worden door de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst geregistreerd en toegelaten in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke internationale voorschriften.   
2.  Particuliere motorrijtuigen en aanhangwagens daarvan worden door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht slechts geregistreerd en toegelaten, indien ze in overeenstemming met artikel 11 van deze Overeenkomst zijn verzekerd tegen aansprakelijkheid. Deze registratie en toelating wordt door hen ingetrokken of ongeldig verklaard wanneer deze verzekering eindigt.   
3.  Motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens, vaartuigen en luchtvaartuigen die overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn geregistreerd en toegelaten of die worden gebruikt door een krijgsmacht op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek, voeren behalve een registratienummer of een ander passend herkenningsteken een duidelijk nationaliteits kenteken. Herkenningstekens op particuliere motorrijtuigen en aanhangwagens moeten duidelijk verschillen van die welke gebruikt worden op dienstvoertuigen en -aanhangwagens. De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht lichten de Duitse autoriteiten in omtrent het systeem van kentekens dat wordt gebruikt voor de door hen geregistreerde en toegelaten motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens en vaartuigen. Op een met redenen omkleed verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten verstrekken de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht in individuele gevallen de namen en adressen van de personen op wier naam particuliere motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens of lucht vaartuigen zijn geregistreerd en toegelaten in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
4.  Het kentekenbewijs van een particulier motorrijtuig of een particuliere aanhangwagen vermeldt het registratienummer, de naam of het handelsmerk van de fabrikant, het fabrieks- of serienummer, de datum van de eerste registratie op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek en de naam en voornamen van de houder. Het bewijs dient te zijn voorzien van een Duitse vertaling. Het bewijs van inschrijving van een particulier luchtvaartuig dient te worden gebaseerd op de Normen en Aanbevolen Werkwijzen van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie. Andere dan dienst-binnenvaartuigen van een krijgsmacht met een waterverplaatsing van vijftien ton of meer voeren aan boord een bewijs van deugdelijkheid, dat kan worden afgegeven door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht.   
5.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht nemen passende veiligheidsmaatregelen met betrekking tot motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens, vaartuigen en luchtvaartuigen die door hen zijn geregistreerd en toegelaten of in gebruik zijn bij de krijgsmacht op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst en gezinsleden mogen op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek particuliere motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens en luchtvaartuigen slechts gebruiken of laten gebruiken indien de uit dat gebruik voortvloeiende risico's worden gedekt door verzekering tegen wettelijke aansprakelijkheid in overeenstemming met de Duitse wetgeving.   
2.  Een verzekering tegen wettelijke aansprakelijkheid van door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht te registreren en toe te laten motorrijtuigen, aanhangwagens of luchtvaartuigen, kan worden gesloten bij een verzekeringsmaatschappij die in een staat van herkomst bevoegd is tot het verzekeren tegen wettelijke aansprakelijkheid, mits nevens een zodanige maatschappij een op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek tot de uitoefening van het verzekeringsbedrijf gerechtigde verzekeraar of combinatie van verzekeraars de uit de wettelijke aansprakelijkheidsverzekering voortvloeiende verplichting aanvaardt met betrekking tot schade ontstaan op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek. De overeenkomstig de Duitse wetgeving geldende vereisten met betrekking tot de benadeelde derde worden niet aangetast door de voorwaarden van die verzekering.   
3.  Voorzover in de staten van herkomst deviezenvoorschriften bestaan dragen deze staten er zorg voor, dat alle betalingen die moeten worden verricht door verzekeraars of combinaties van verzekeraars die op hun grondgebied tot de uitoefening van het verzekeringsbedrijf bevoegd zijn, kunnen geschieden op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek en in de valuta van de Bondsrepubliek.   

### Artikel  12  

1.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen leden van een civiele dienst en andere personen in dienst bij de krijgsmacht machtigen tot het bezitten en dragen van wapenen in verband met de verantwoordelijkheid van die personen voor de beveiliging van geld of goederen of de omstandigheid dat zij in bijzondere mate gevaar lopen tengevolge van het speciale karakter van hun officiële functie of werkzaamheden.   
2.  De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht stellen met betrekking tot het gebruik van wapenen door de personen die daartoe gemachtigd zijn op de voet van het eerste lid van dit artikel, voorschriften vast die in overeenstemming zijn met de Duitse wetgeving inzake noodweer (Notwehr).   
3.  De personen, gemachtigd op de voet van het eerste lid van dit artikel, mogen uitsluitend vuurwapenen bij zich dragen indien zij in het bezit zijn van een verklaring afgegeven door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, dat zij daartoe gerechtigd zijn. Een dienstidentiteitsbewijs voorzien van een desbetreffende aantekening wordt eveneens als een zodanige verklaring beschouwd.   
4.  De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht geven deze verklaringen uitsluitend af aan personen omtrent wier betrouwbaarheid redelijkerwijs geen twijfel bestaat. Zij nemen verzoeken van de Duitse autoriteiten om intrekking van deze verklaringen welwillend in onderzoek en trekken deze verklaringen in, indien is komen vast te staan dat de houder zijn vuurwapen heeft misbruikt of indien redelijkerwijs twijfel bestaat ten aanzien van zijn betrouwbaarheid.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  Voorzover niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, zijn internationale overeenkomsten of andere op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde voorschriften betreffende sociale zekerheid, met inbegrip van sociale en medische verzorging, niet van toepassing op de leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst en op gezinsleden. De rechten en verplichtingen van deze personen op het gebied van sociale zekerheid die zijn ontstaan gedurende een vroeger verblijf op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek blijven echter onaangetast. De omstandigheid dat een persoon behoort tot een van de categorieën als bedoeld in de bovenstaande volzinnen sluit bovendien de mogelijkheid niet uit dat hij premiën betaalt voor de Duitse sociale verzekering (soziale Kranken- und Rentenversicherung) teneinde de verzekering op basis van vrijwilligheid voort te zetten (freiwillige Weiterversicherung), noch de mogelijkheid dat hij rechten voortvloeiend uit een bestaande verzekering verkrijgt en laat gelden.   
2.  De verplichtingen van een lid van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of van een gezinslid in zijn hoedanigheid van werkgever worden niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  14  

Indien een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid is vrijgesteld van de verplichting een huwelijksbevoegdheidscertificaat (Ehefähigkeitszeugnis) over te leggen mogen de te betalen leges - waarvan de grootte wordt vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de omvang en de moeilijkheden van de daartoe te verrichten administratieve werkzaamheden - de som van vijftig Duitse marken niet te boven gaan.  

### Artikel  15  

1.  De verplichting ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving om aangifte te doen van geboorte en overlijden bij een ambtenaar van de Duitse Burgerlijke Stand geldt niet ten aanzien van de geboorte van een kind van, of de dood van, een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of van een gezinslid; wordt evenwel van een zodanige geboorte of overlijden bij een ambtenaar van de Duitse Burgerlijke Stand aangifte gedaan, dan vindt inschrijving plaats overeenkomstig de voorschriften van de Duitse wetgeving.   
2.  De verplichting tot aangifte van geboorte en van overlijden blijft bestaan indien het kind of de overledene een Duitser is.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  De militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst zijn, in overeenstemming met de in die staat geldende voorschriften, gerechtigd te beschikken over de stoffelijke resten van de leden van de krijgsmacht, van de civiele dienst of van gezinsleden die zijn overleden op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek, alsmede die lijkschouwingen te verrichten die uit medische overwegingen of met het oog op een strafrechtelijk onderzoek noodzakelijk zijn. Verzoeken van Duitse autoriteiten om lijkschouwingen te verrichten worden ingewilligd indien lijkschouwing is toegelaten krachtens de wet van de staat van herkomst. Bij de lijkschouwing mag een aan een Duitse Rechtbank verbonden arts (Gerichtsarzt) en, in het geval van een lijkschouwing met het oog op een strafrechtelijk onderzoek, een Duitse rechter, aanwezig zijn. In geval een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit bevoegd is een lijkschouwing te gelasten, zijn de tweede en derde volzin van dit lid van overeenkomstige toepassing indien de militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst belang hebben bij het resultaat van de lijkschouwing.   
2.  De militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst zijn, indien zij daartoe krachtens de wetgeving van die staat bevoegd zijn, gerechtigd tot het in bezit nemen van de zich binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevindende persoonlijke roerende eigendommen van de overledene en deze in de eerste plaats aan te wenden tot betaling van alle volgens het recht van de staat van herkomst bevoorrechte vorderingen en in de tweede plaats tot de voldoening van alle andere op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek ontstane schulden ten aanzien waarvan op dat grondgebied een wettelijke betalingsverplichting bestaat, en daarna over het restant te beschikken overeenkomstig het recht dat ten aanzien van de nalatenschap van de overledene van toepassing is. De bepalingen van dit lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de overledene een Duitser is.   
3.  De krijgsmachten hebben het recht op overeengekomen terreinen begraafplaatsen aan te leggen en te onderhouden voorzover dit noodzakelijk is bij de vervulling van hun taak ten aanzien van de verdediging.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  Indien het, ter beantwoording van de vraag welke autoriteit bevoegd is tot het uitoefenen van rechtsmacht met betrekking tot een strafbaar feit, noodzakelijk is vast te stellen of een feit strafbaar is volgens het recht van een staat van herkomst, schorst de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit die de zaak behandelt de behandeling en doet daarvan mededeling aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de staat van herkomst. De daarvoor in aanmerking komende autoriteit van de staat van herkomst kan binnen eenentwintig dagen na ontvangst van de mededeling of, zolang die mededeling nog niet heeft plaatsgehad te allen tijde, aan de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit een officiële verklaring overleggen nopens de vraag of het feit volgens het recht van de staat van herkomst al dan niet strafbaar is. Indien het antwoord bevestigend luidt, dient de verklaring tevens aan te geven op grond van welke bepaling of welke wettelijke grondslag het feit strafbaar is alsmede welke straf daartegen bedreigd is.   
2.  De Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit neemt haar beslissing in overeenstemming met de verklaring. Bij uitzondering kan deze verklaring echter op verzoek van de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit door middel van een bespreking tussen de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek en de diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging van de staat van herkomst in de Bondsrepubliek aan een nader onderzoek worden onderworpen.   
3.  Indien moet worden vastgesteld of een feit naar Duits recht strafbaar is, is de in het eerste en tweede lid voorgeschreven procedure van overeenkomstige toepassing met betrekking tot dat feit, met dien verstande dat in dat geval de officiële verklaring wordt afgegeven door de hoogste bevoegde autoriteit van de Bondsrepubliek of van het betrokken Duitse Land.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing tussen de Bondsrepubliek en die staten van herkomst die de Bondsrepubliek ervan in kennis stellen dat zij niet voornemens zijn zich op deze bepalingen te beroepen of de voorrechten ervan aan de Bondsrepubliek te verzekeren.   

### Artikel  18  

1.  Indien het in de loop van een strafproces tegen een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst noodzakelijk is vast te stellen of een strafbaar feit is voortgevloeid uit een daad of nalatigheid begaan in de uitoefening van de dienst, is voor deze vaststelling het recht van de betrokken staat van herkomst beslissend. De hoogste bevoegde autoriteit van deze staat van herkomst kan aan de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit die met de behandeling van deze zaak is belast, daaromtrent een officiële verklaring overleggen.   
2.  De Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit beslist in overeenstemming met de verklaring. Bij uitzondering kan deze verklaring echter op verzoek van de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit door middel van een bespreking tussen de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek en de diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging van de staat van herkomst in de Bondsrepubliek aan een nader onderzoek worden onderworpen.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  Op verzoek van een staat van herkomst doet de Bondsrepubliek in het kader van artikel VII, derde lid onder *c* van het NAVO-Status Verdrag ten gunste van die staat afstand van het ingevolge het derde lid onder *b* van genoemd artikel aan de Duitse autoriteiten toegekende recht om in gevallen van samenloop van rechtsmacht bij voorrang rechtsmacht uit te oefenen, en wel overeenkomstig het tweede, derde, vierde en zevende lid van dit artikel.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van eventuele bijzondere regelingen, getroffen krachtens het zevende lid van dit artikel, stellen de militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van iedere afzonderlijke zaak die onder de afstand van rechtsmacht als bedoeld in het eerste lid valt.   
3.  Indien de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten van oordeel zijn dat in verband met de bijzondere omstandigheden van een bepaalde zaak zeer gewichtige belangen van de Duitse rechtspleging de uitoefening van rechtsmacht door de Duitse autoriteiten gebieden, kunnen zij de afstand van rechtsmacht, gedaan ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel, herroepen door een verklaring die zij aan de bevoegde militaire autoriteiten overleggen binnen eenentwintig dagen na ontvangst van de kennisgeving bedoeld in het tweede lid, dan wel binnen een kortere termijn die bij een eventueel in het kader van het zevende lid getroffen regeling kan worden vastgesteld. De Duitse autoriteiten kunnen deze verklaring ook vóór de ontvangst van bedoelde kennisgeving afgeven.   
4.  Indien de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten op grond van het derde lid van dit artikel de afstand van rechtsmacht in een bepaalde zaak hebben herroepen en besprekingen tussen de betrokken autoriteiten niet tot overeenstemming leiden, kan de diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging van de betrokken staat van herkomst in de Bondsrepubliek bezwaren maken bij de Bondsregering. Naar behoren rekening houdende met de belangen van de Duitse rechtspleging en de belangen van de staat van herkomst brengt de Bondsregering het meningsverschil tot een oplossing met gebruikmaking van haar bevoegdheden op het gebied van de buitenlandse betrekkingen.   
5.  

a) De militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst die afstand van voorrang van rechtsmacht ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel heeft gevraagd, kunnen met toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten bepaalde strafzaken, ten aanzien waarvan rechtsmacht berust bij die staat, voor onderzoek, berechting en uitspraak overdragen aan de Duitse rechtbanken of autoriteiten.  

b) De Duitse autoriteiten kunnen, met toestemming van de militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst die afstand van voorrang van rechtsmacht ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel heeft gevraagd, bepaalde strafzaken ten aanzien waarvan rechtsmacht bij de Bondsrepubliek berust, voor onderzoek, berechting en uitspraak overdragen aan de militaire autoriteiten van die staat van herkomst.     
6.  

a) Indien een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit ingevolge artikel VII tweede lid sub *b* van het NAVO-Status Verdrag bij uitsluiting rechtsmacht uitoefent, wordt op speciaal of algemeen verzoek van de betrokken staat van herkomst aan de in artikel 32 bedoelde verbindingsinstantie een afschrift van elk aan de verdachte uitgereikt stuk toegezonden.  

b) De verbindingsinstantie verleent de Duitse rechtbanken en autoriteiten medewerking om de betekening van stukken in strafzaken te vergemakkelijken.     
7.  Ter uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit artikel en ter vergemakkelijking van een vlotte afdoening van strafbare feiten van lichtere aard kunnen tussen de militaire autoriteiten van een staat of staten van herkomst en de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten regelingen worden getroffen. Deze regelingen kunnen mede betrekking hebben op de ontheffing van de verplichting tot kennisgeving en op de termijn, bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel, waarbinnen de afstand van rechtsmacht kan worden herroepen.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  De militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst kunnen een persoon die niet aan hun rechtsmacht onderworpen is, zonder arrestatiebevel in voorlopige hechtenis stellen, 

a) indien die persoon op heterdaad betrapt wordt of achtervolgd wordt en 

i) zijn identiteit niet onmiddellijk kan worden vastgesteld, of  

ii) er gevaar voor vlucht bestaat; of    

b) indien dit door een Duitse autoriteit wordt verzocht; of  

c) op verzoek van een autoriteit van een andere staat van herkomst indien die persoon lid is van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst van die staat dan wel een gezinslid van een zodanig lid.     
2.  Indien er gevaar bestaat voor vertraging en een Duitse openbare aanklager of politiefunctionaris niet tijdig bereikbaar is, kunnen de militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst een persoon die niet aan hun rechtsmacht onderworpen is, zonder arrestatiebevel in voorlopige hechtenis stellen, indien ernstige verdenking (dringender Verdacht) bestaat dat die persoon een strafbaar feit heeft gepleegd of een strafbare poging doet tot het plegen van een strafbaar feit binnen, of gericht tegen, een inrichting van die staat dan wel een feit dat strafbaar is ingevolge artikel 7 van de vierde wet tot wijziging van de strafwetgeving van 11 juni 1957 (Bundesgesetzblatt Deel I, blz. 597) junctis de artikelen 99, 100, 100 *c*, 100 *d*, 100 *e*, 109 *f*, 109 *g* en 363 van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht, of ingevolge wettelijke voorzieningen die in de toekomst eventueel in de plaats van deze bepalingen zullen treden. Deze bepaling is slechts van toepassing, indien de betrokkene voortvluchtig is of zich verborgen houdt of indien gegronde reden bestaat om te vrezen dat hij zich aan strafvervolging ter zake van het plegen van een strafbaar feit of van een strafbare poging daartoe als bovenbedoeld tracht te onttrekken.   
3.  In de gevallen bedoeld in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel kunnen de militaire autoriteiten, voorzover zulks nodig is, de in voorlopige hechtenis genomen persoon ontwapenen en hem visiteren alsmede alle in zijn bezit zijnde voorwerpen die als bewijsmiddel voor het onderzoek van het strafbare feit waarvan hij wordt verdacht of beschuldigd kunnen dienen, in beslag nemen.   
4.  De militaire autoriteiten geven een persoon die overeenkomstig dit artikel in voorlopige hechtenis is genomen alsmede de inbeslaggenomen wapens of andere voorwerpen onverwijld over aan de dichtstbijzijnde Duitse openbare aanklager, politiefunctionaris of rechter of aan de militaire autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst tot welke krijgsmacht of civiele dienst de persoon, hetzij als lid hetzij als gezinslid, behoort.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel maken geen inbreuk op de grondwettelijke onschendbaarheid van de parlementen van de Bondsrepubliek en de Länder.   

### Artikel  21  

1.  Indien een Duitse autoriteit een onderzoek opent of een arrestatie verricht wegens een handeling die strafbaar is ingevolge artikel 7 van de vierde wet tot wijziging; van de strafwetgeving van 11 juni 1957 (Bundesgesetzblatt Deel I, blz. 597) of ingevolge wettelijke voorzieningen die in de toekomst eventueel in de plaats van dat artikel zullen treden, stelt de Duitse autoriteit die het onderzoek leidt de militaire autoriteiten van de betrokken staat van herkomst daarvan onverwijld in kennis. Hetzelfde geldt indien een Duitse autoriteit een onderzoek opent of een arrestatie verricht wegens een handeling die op andere wijze gericht is tegen de veiligheid van een staat van herkomst of zijn krijgsmacht.   
2.  Indien de bevoegde autoriteit van een staat van herkomst op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek een onderzoek opent of een arrestatie verricht wegens een handeling die gepleegd is op dat grondgebied en in verband staat met aangelegenheden die de veiligheid van de Bondsrepubliek raken, stelt die autoriteit de Duitse autoriteiten daarvan onverwijld in kennis.   

### Artikel  22  

1.  

a) Indien rechtsmacht wordt uitgeoefend door de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst, berust de bewaring van leden van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst of van gezinsleden bij de autoriteiten van die staat.  

b) Indien rechtsmacht wordt uitgeoefend door de Duitse autoriteiten berust de bewaring van leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden bij de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst overeenkomstig het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel.     
2.  

a) Indien de arrestatie is verricht door de Duitse autoriteiten wordt de gearresteerde persoon overgegeven aan de autoriteiten van de betrokken staat van herkomst, indien deze autoriteiten zulks verzoeken.  

b) Indien de arrestatie is verricht door de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst of indien de gearresteerde persoon aan hen is overgegeven overeenkomstig lid 2 *a* 

i) kunnen zij de bewaring te allen tijde overdragen aan de Duitse autoriteiten;  

ii) nemen zij een door de Duitse autoriteiten in bepaalde gevallen gedaan verzoek om overdracht van de bewaring in welwillende overweging.    

c) In het geval van strafbare feiten, uitsluitend gericht tegen de veiligheid van de Bondsrepubliek, berust de bewaring bij de Duitse autoriteiten overeenkomstig eventueel daartoe met de autoriteiten van de betrokken staat van herkomst te treffen regelingen.     
3.  Indien de bewaring overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel bij de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst berust, blijft zij bij deze autoriteiten berusten tot de invrijheidstelling of vrijspraak door de Duitse autoriteiten, dan wel totdat de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis een aanvang neemt. De autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst stellen de gearresteerde persoon ter beschikking van de Duitse autoriteiten voor het onderzoek en het strafproces (Ermittlungs- und Strafverfahren) en nemen daartoe alle passende maatregelen. Zij nemen eveneens alle passende maatregelen om te voorkomen dat onderzoek en strafproces nadelig worden beïnvloed (Verdunkelungsgefahr). Zij houden zo veel mogelijk rekening met elk van de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten afkomstig verzoek inzake bewaring.   

### Artikel  23  

Indien een persoon in een van de gevallen als bedoeld in artikel 21, eerste lid, wordt gearresteerd heeft een vertegenwoordiger van de betrokken staat van herkomst toegang tot die persoon. Indien een persoon die in een van de gevallen als bedoeld in het tweede lid van dat artikel is gearresteerd, door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht in bewaring wordt gehouden, heeft een Duitse vertegenwoordiger een overeenkomstig recht, in dezelfde mate als waarin de staat van herkomst gebruik maakt van het recht van toegang, toegekend in de eerste volzin van dit artikel. De Duitse autoriteiten en de militaire autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst treffen de voor de uitvoering van dit artikel vereiste regelingen. Een vertegenwoordiger van de staat bij welke de bewaring berust kan bij de uitoefening van het recht van toegang tegenwoordig zijn.  

### Artikel  24  

Op verzoek van de Bondsrepubliek of van een staat van herkomst treffen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van die staat regelingen ter vergemakkelijking van de nakoming van de verplichting tot wederzijdse hulp bedoeld in het vijfde lid onder *a* en het zesde lid onder *a* van artikel VII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag.  

### Artikel  25  

1.  

a) Indien rechtsmacht in strafzaken wordt uitgeoefend door een Duitse rechtbank of een Duitse autoriteit over een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of over een gezinslid, heeft een vertegenwoordiger van de betrokken staat van herkomst het recht bij de terechtzitting aanwezig te zijn. Indien een vergrijp uitsluitend is gericht tegen de veiligheid van de Bondsrepubliek of tegen eigendommen welke zich in de Bondsrepubliek bevinden dan wel tegen een Duitser of tegen een persoon die zich op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevindt en rechtsmacht op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek wordt uitgeoefend door een rechtbank of een autoriteit van een staat van herkomst, heeft een Duitse vertegenwoordiger het recht de terechtzitting bij te wonen.  

b) In het onder *a* bepaalde 

i) worden onder de uitdrukking „eigendommen welke zich in de Bondsrepubliek bevinden” niet begrepen eigendommen welke toebehoren aan een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of aan een gezinslid;  

ii) wordt onder de uitdrukking „een persoon die zich op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevindt” niet begrepen een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid.    

c) Het bepaalde onder *a* is niet van toepassing indien de aanwezigheid van een nationale vertegenwoordiger niet verenigbaar is met die veiligheidseisen van de staat welke rechtsmacht uitoefent die niet tevens veiligheidseisen zijn van de andere staat.  

d) De Duitse rechtbanken en autoriteiten enerzijds en de rechtbanken en autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst anderzijds stellen er tijdig in kennis van de plaats en de tijd van de terechtzitting.     
2.  Onder de voorwaarden, omschreven in het eerste lid, heeft een vertegenwoordiger van de staat van herkomst ook het recht verhoren en andere opsporingshandelingen bij te wonen voor zover dit tussen de autoriteiten van die staat en die van de Bondsrepubliek eventueel overeengekomen wordt. Indien dergelijke overeenkomsten worden gesloten, geven deze - onder de in het eerste lid omschreven voorwaarden - aan een Duitse vertegenwoordiger een recht overeenkomend met dat van de vertegenwoordiger van de staat van herkomst en voorzien zij in een procedure met betrekking tot wederkerige kennisgeving.   

### Artikel  26  

1.  Indien een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid voor een rechtbank van een staat van herkomst wordt gedagvaard ter zake van een op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek begaan vergrijp tegen Duitse belangen wordt de terechtzitting binnen dat grondgebied gehouden, 

a) tenzij zulks in strijd is met de wetgeving van de staat van herkomst, of  

b) tenzij de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst in geval van militaire noodzaak of in het belang van een goede rechtsbedeling voornemens zijn de terechtzitting buiten het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek te doen plaatsvinden. In dat geval geven zij de Duitse autoriteiten tijdig de gelegenheid hun opvattingen omtrent een zodanig voornemen kenbaar te maken en houden zij rekening met de opvattingen die laatstgenoemden eventueel kenbaar maken.     
2.  Indien de terechtzitting buiten het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek wordt gehouden, stellen de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van plaats en datum van de terechtzitting. Een Duitse vertegenwoordiger is gerechtigd de terechtzitting bij te wonen tenzij de voorschriften van het procesrecht van de staat van herkomst zich hiertegen verzetten of zijn aanwezigheid onverenigbaar is met die veiligheidseisen van die staat die niet tevens veiligheidseisen zijn van de Bondsrepubliek. De autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst stellen de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van de uitspraak en van de uiteindelijke afloop van het proces.   

### Artikel  27  

De artikelen 212 tot en met 212 (*b*) van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafvordering, die betrekking hebben op de versnelde procedure, zijn niet van toepassing in een strafvervolging tegen leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of tegen gezinsleden.  

### Artikel  28  

1.  De militaire politie van een krijgsmacht is bevoegd te patrouilleren op openbare wegen, in openbare vervoermiddelen, in restaurants en logeergelegenheden (Gaststätten) en in alle andere voor het publiek toegankelijke plaatsen en ten aanzien van leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of gezinsleden die maatregelen te treffen welke noodzakelijk zijn voor de handhaving van orde en tucht. Voorzover zulks noodzakelijk of doelmatig is worden de bijzonderheden inzake de uitoefening van dit recht vastgesteld in overleg tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, die terzake wederkerig nauw contact zullen onderhouden.   
2.  Indien de openbare orde en veiligheid in gevaar worden gebracht of verstoord door een incident waarbij leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of gezinsleden zijn betrokken, neemt de militaire politie van een krijgsmacht op verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten ten aanzien van deze personen de vereiste maatregelen teneinde orde en tucht te handhaven of te herstellen.   

### Artikel  29  

1.  De Bondsrepubliek neemt die wettelijke maatregelen welke zij noodzakelijk acht om op haar grondgebied de veiligheid en de bescherming te verzekeren van de krijgsmachten, de civiele diensten en van de leden daarvan. Het voorgaande is eveneens van toepassing op de gewapende strijdkrachten van een staat van herkomst welke in Berlijn zijn gestationeerd, op hun civiele dienst en op de leden daarvan voor wat betreft vergrijpen begaan op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek.   
2.  Ter uitvoering van artikel VII, elfde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van het eerste lid van dit artikel verzekert de Bondsrepubliek in het bijzonder 

a) de bescherming van militaire geheimen van de staten van herkomst overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht inzake hoogverraad;  

b) de strafrechtelijke bescherming van een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst en hun leden, welke bescherming tenminste gelijk is aan die welke de Duitse strijdkrachten genieten of zullen genieten, en wel met betrekking tot de volgende onderwerpen: 

i) beïnvloeding van een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst of hun leden met het oogmerk hun bereidheid tot vervulling van de dienst te ondermijnen;  

ii) het blootstellen van de krijgsmacht aan smaad;  

iii) het aanzetten tot ongehoorzaamheid;  

iv) het aanzetten tot desertie;  

v) het bevorderen van desertie;  

vi) sabotage;  

vii) het verzamelen van inlichtingen inzake militaire aangelegenheden;  

viii) het doen functioneren van een militaire inlichtingendienst;  

ix) het maken van afbeeldingen of beschrijvingen van militaire uitrusting, militaire installaties of inrichtingen dan wel van militaire activiteiten;  

x) het maken van luchtfoto's.       
3.  Voor de toepassing van het tweede lid onder *a* wordt onder militaire geheimen verstaan feiten, voorwerpen, conclusies en ontdekkingen, in het bijzonder schriftelijke stukken, tekeningen, modellen, formules, of inlichtingen hierover, welke de verdediging betreffen en welke door een dienst van een staat van herkomst, gestationeerd op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek of in Berlijn, in het belang van de veiligheid van die staat of haar krijgsmacht of haar in Berlijn gestationeerde gewapende strijdkrachten, geheim worden gehouden. Hieronder vallen niet voorwerpen over wier geheimhouding de beslissing bij de Bondsrepubliek berust, met inbegrip van inlichtingen over die voorwerpen.   

### Artikel  30  

Teneinde de uitvoering van artikel VII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de bepalingen van deze Aanvullende Overeenkomst te vergemakkelijken en een uniforme toepassing ervan te verzekeren, worden op verzoek van een van beide partijen gemengde commissies ingesteld, die bestaan uit een door de Bondsregering te benoemen Duitse vertegenwoordiger en een vertegenwoordiger van de betrokken staat van herkomst. Deze gemengde commissies hebben tot taak vraagstukken te bespreken betreffende de toepassing van de in dit artikel bedoelde bepalingen, welke vraagstukken aan haar worden voorgelegd door de Bondsregering of door de hoogste autoriteit van de betrokken krijgsmacht. De Duitse autoriteiten en autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst nemen eventuele gemeenschappelijke aanbevelingen van een gemengde commissie in welwillende overweging.  

### Artikel  31  

De leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst genieten, voor wat betreft de gratis-admissie en de ontheffing van de verplichting tot zekerheidstelling voor proceskosten, de rechten terzake vastgelegd in overeenkomsten tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de betrokken staat van herkomst. Indien deze personen zich uit hoofde van hun dienst op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevinden, worden zij voor de toepassing van die overeenkomsten geacht aldaar hun vaste verblijfplaats (ständiger Aufenthalt) te hebben.  

### Artikel  32  

1.  

a) De betekening aan de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of aan gezinsleden van een dagvaarding, een ander document of een gerechtelijke beschikking waarmede een niet-strafrechtelijke procedure voor een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit aanhangig wordt gemaakt, geschiedt door tussenkomst van een verbindingsinstantie, in te stellen of aan te wijzen door iedere staat van herkomst. De Duitse rechtbanken of autoriteiten kunnen de verbindingsinstantie verzoeken voor de betekening van andere documenten in een zodanige procedure zorg te dragen.  

b) De verbindingsinstantie bevestigt onverwijld de ontvangst van elk verzoek van een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit om stukken te betekenen. De betekening is geschied wanneer het te betekenen document is uitgereikt aan de geadresseerde door de commandant van zijn onderdeel of door de vertegenwoordiger van de verbindingsinstantie. De Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit ontvangt onverwijld schriftelijk bericht dat de betekening is geschied.  

c) 

i) Indien de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit binnen eenentwintig dagen na de dagtekening van de ontvangstbevestiging door de verbindingsinstantie geen schriftelijk bericht heeft ontvangen, dat de betekening is geschied overeenkomstig het gestelde onder *b*, noch enige mededeling dat het niet mogelijk was de betekening te doen geschieden, zendt de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit de verbindingsinstantie een ander exemplaar van het verzoek om betekening, onder mededeling dat zeven dagen na ontvangst door de verbingingsinstantie de betekening wordt geacht te zijn geschied. Na verloop van de termijn van zeven dagen wordt de betekening geacht te zijn geschied.  

ii) De betekening wordt echter niet geacht te zijn geschied, indien de verbindingsinstantie binnen de termijn van eenentwintig dagen of eventueel van zeven dagen de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit mededeelt, dat zij er niet in geslaagd is de betekening te doen geschieden. De verbindingsinstantie deelt de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit mede om welke redenen zij er niet in is geslaagd de betekening te doen geschieden.  

iii) In het geval, bedoeld onder ii, kan de verbindingsinstantie de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit onder opgave van redenen ook om verlenging van de termijn verzoeken. Indien het verzoek om verlenging van de termijn door de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit wordt ingewilligd zijn de punten i en ii van overeenkomstige toepassing op de verlengde termijn.       
2.  Indien een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit een vonnis of een document betekent dat betrekking heeft op het instellen van een rechtsmiddel (Rechtsmittelschrift), wordt, indien de betrokken staat van herkomst hierom in het bijzonder of in het algemeen verzoekt, een afschrift ervan onverwijld aan de verbindingsinstantie toegezonden, behalve ingeval de verbindingsinstantie zelf, overeenkomstig het in het eerste lid onder *a*, tweede volzin, bepaalde, verzocht wordt de betekening te doen geschieden.   

### Artikel  33  

De leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of gezinsleden mogen, wanneer zij tengevolge van verplichtingen voortspruitende uit de dienst of door rechtmatige afwezigheid tijdelijk verhinderd zijn een niet-strafrechtelijke procedure waarbij zij partij zijn, bij te wonen, hiervan geen nadeel ondervinden.  

### Artikel  34  

1.  De militaire autoriteiten werken naar vermogen mede aan de tenuitvoerlegging van in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraken en andere executoriale titels (vollstreckbare Titel) van Duitse rechtbanken of autoriteiten in niet strafrechtelijke procedures.   
2.  Een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit is niet bevoegd een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid te gijzelen, hetzij voor de tenuitvoerlegging van in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraken of andere executoriale titels, hetzij om een schuldenaar te dwingen onder ede te verklaren dat hij een juiste opgave van zijn vermogenstoestand heeft verstrekt (Offenbarungseid), hetzij om enige andere reden verband houdend met een niet-strafrechtelijke procedure.   
3.  De bedragen verschuldigd door een Regering aan een lid van haar krijgsmacht of civiele dienst zijn slechts in zoverre onderworpen aan beslag of een andere vorm van executie op last van een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit als door de op het grondgebied van de staat van herkomst geldende wetgeving is toegelaten.   
4.  Wanneer de tenuitvoerlegging van een in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraak van een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit in een niet-strafrechtelijke procedure plaats dient te vinden binnen een inrichting van een krijgsmacht, wordt deze tenuitvoerlegging door een Duitse deurwaarder uitgevoerd in tegenwoordigheid van een vertegenwoordiger van de krijgsmacht.   

### Artikel  35  

Indien een in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraak (vollstreckbare Titel) van een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit moet worden tenuitvoergelegd tegen een schuldenaar aan wie een bedrag verschuldigd is, hetzij uit hoofde van zijn dienstbetrekking bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst op de voet van het bepaalde in artikel 56, hetzij uit hoofde van rechtstreekse leveranties of diensten aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, gelden de volgende bepalingen: 

a) Indien de betaling plaatsvindt door tussenkomst van een Duitse autoriteit, is die autoriteit, indien haar door een instantie die met de tenuitvoerlegging is belast wordt verzocht het bedrag niet aan de schuldenaar maar aan de schuldeiser die beslag heeft gelegd te betalen, gerechtigd aan dat verzoek te voldoen binnen de grenzen van de Duitse wettelijke voorschriften.  

b) 

i) Indien de betaling niet plaatsvindt door tussenkomst van een Duitse autoriteit deponeren de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst op verzoek van een dienst die met de tenuitvoerlegging is belast, van de geldsom die zij erkennen aan de schuldenaar tegen wie de executie plaatsvindt schuldig te zijn, het in het verzoek genoemde bedrag bij de bevoegde dienst, voorzover de wetgeving van die betrokken staat van herkomst dit toelaat. Zulks strekt de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst tot het gedeponeerde bedrag tegenover de schuldenaar tot bevrijding van haar schuld.  

ii) Voorzover de wetgeving van de betrokken staat van herkomst de onder i omschreven procedure niet toelaat nemen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst alle geëigende maatregelen om de dienst die met de tenuitvoerlegging is belast bij de tenuitvoerlegging van in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraken bij te staan.      

### Artikel  36  

1.  De betekening door Duitse rechtbanken en autoriteiten aan leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of aan gezinsleden geschiedt niet door middel van openbare kennisgevingen of aankondigingen in de pers.   
2.  Indien de betekening van een document door een Duitse deurwaarder moet geschieden aan een persoon die zich binnen een inrichting van een krijgsmacht bevindt, neemt de autoriteit van de krijgsmacht die verantwoordelijk is voor het beheer van de inrichting alle maatregelen die noodzakelijk zijn om de Duitse deurwaarder in staat te stellen de betekening te verrichten.   

### Artikel  37  

1.  

a) Indien een lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst wordt gedagvaard voor een Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit, dragen de militaire autoriteiten, tenzij militaire noodzaak zich hiertegen verzet, er zorg voor dat de betrokkene verschijnt, mits die verschijning ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving verplicht is. De verbindingsinstantie wordt verzocht er voor zorg te dragen dat aan deze dagvaarding gevolg wordt gegeven.  

b) Het gestelde onder *a* is van overeenkomstige toepassing op gezinsleden voorzover de militaire autoriteiten voor hun verschijning kunnen zorgdragen; indien zulks niet het geval is worden gezinsleden overeenkomstig de Duitse wetgeving gedagvaard.     
2.  Indien personen, voor wier verschijning niet kan worden zorggedragen door de militaire autoriteiten, als getuigen of deskundigen door een rechtbank of een militaire autoriteit van een staat van herkomst worden gedagvaard, dragen de Duitse rechtbanken en autoriteiten, in overeenstemming met de Duitse wetgeving, zorg voor de verschijning van die personen voor de rechtbank of militaire autoriteit van de staat van herkomst.   

### Artikel  38  

1.  Indien in de loop van een al dan niet strafrechtelijke procedure voor een rechtbank of autoriteit van een krijgsmacht of van de Bondsrepubliek blijkt dat een staatsgeheim van een der betrokken staten, of van beide, of een inlichting die de veiligheid van een dezer staten, of van beide, zou kunnen schaden, openbaar gemaakt zou kunnen worden, verzoekt de rechtbank of autoriteit, alvorens verdere actie te nemen, de bevoegde autoriteit om schriftelijk haar toestemming te geven tot het openbaar maken van het staatsgeheim of de inlichting. Indien de bevoegde autoriteit bezwaar heeft tegen de openbaarmaking, neemt de rechtbank of autoriteit alle haar ter beschikking staande maatregelen, met inbegrip van die bedoeld in het tweede lid, om de openbaarmaking te voorkomen, mits daardoor geen inbreuk gemaakt wordt op de grondwettelijke rechten van een der partijen.   
2.  De bepalingen van de artikelen 172 tot en met 175 van de Duitse Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), aangaande behandeling met gesloten deuren in al dan niet strafrechtelijke procedures, en de bepalingen van artikel 15 van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafvordering inzake de overdracht van strafzaken aan een rechtbank in een ander ressort, zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing in zaken voor Duitse rechtbanken en autoriteiten, indien de veiligheid van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in gevaar dreigt te worden gebracht.   

### Artikel  39  

De rechten en voorrechten van getuigen en deskundigen worden bepaald door de wetgeving van de rechtbank of autoriteit voor welke zij verschijnen. Indien getuigen of deskundigen lid van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of gezinslid zijn, houdt de rechtbank of autoriteit naar behoren rekening met de rechten en voorrechten die zij zouden hebben voor een rechtbank van de staat van herkomst of, indien zij niet tot deze categorieën behoren, voor een Duitse rechtbank.  

### Artikel  40  

Voorzover in enige bepaling van het NAVO-Status Verdrag of van deze Overeenkomst niet het tegendeel is bepaald, zijn archieven, documenten, als zodanig kenbare dienstpostzendingen en eigendommen van een krijgsmacht niet vatbaar voor onderzoek, inbeslagneming of censuur door de Duitse autoriteiten, tenzij van die immuniteit afstand is gedaan.  

### Artikel  41  

1.  De regeling van vorderingen terzake van schade veroorzaakt door een handelen of nalaten van een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst of van hun leden, of door andere voorvallen waarvoor een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst wettelijk aansprakelijk is, wordt beheerst door de bepalingen van artikel VIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de aanvullende bepalingen van dit artikel.   
2.  Geen schadeloosstelling wordt betaald in de volgende gevallen: 

a) schade aan openbare wegen, bruggen, bevaarbare waterwegen andere openbare verkeerswerken, voortvloeiende uit het gebruik daarvan door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst voor normale verkeersdoeleinden;  

b) verlies van of schade aan eigendommen die zijn opgericht of aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, of van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of van middelen voor het onderhoud van de krijgsmachten voorzover dit verlies of die schade werd veroorzaakt gedurende de tijd dat de eigendommen voor gebruik ter beschikking stonden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst.     
3.  

a) De Bondsrepubliek doet afstand van al haar vorderingen op een staat van herkomst terzake van verlies van, of schade aan, eigendommen van de Bondsrepubliek die uitsluitend voor het gebruik van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst ter beschikking zijn gesteld. Het vorenstaande is eveneens van toepassing indien deze eigendommen ter beschikking zijn gesteld van de krijgsmachten van verschillende staten van herkomst of worden gebruikt door de krijgsmachten van een of meer staten van herkomst gezamenlijk met de Duitse strijdkrachten. Deze afstand is niet van toepassing op schade die opzettelijk of door grove nalatigheid is veroorzaakt, noch op schade aan de eigendommen van de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen of Duitse Bondsposterijen.  

b) De bepalingen van artikel VIII, tweede lid, onder *f* van het NAVO-Status Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing op verlies van of schade aan eigendommen van de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen of Duitse Bondsposterijen noch op schade aan de Bondswegen.     
4.  De Bondsrepubliek vrijwaart de staten van herkomst voor aanspraken voortvloeiende uit verlies van of schade aan eigendommen van een Land, indien het verlies of de schade werd veroorzaakt vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst.   
5.  Elke staat van herkomst doet afstand van al zijn vorderingen op de Bondsrepubliek ter zake van verlies van of schade aan eigendommen van die staat van herkomst en veroorzaakt door leden of werknemers van de Duitse strijdkrachten, in de uitoefening van hun dienst of door het gebruik van voertuigen, vaartuigen of luchtvaartuigen van de Duitse strijdkrachten, mits die eigendommen gebruikt worden door de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst van die staat, en die eigendommen zich bevinden op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek. Deze afstand is niet van toepassing op schade die opzettelijk of door grove nalatigheid is veroorzaakt.   
6.  De bepalingen van artikel VIII, vijfde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing op schade, geleden door leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst en veroorzaakt door een handelen of nalaten van andere leden van dezelfde krijgsmacht of dezelfde civiele dienst, of door andere voorvallen waarvoor die krijgsmacht of civiele dienst wettelijk aansprakelijk is.   
7.  De organisaties, bedoeld in artikel 71, tweede lid, worden ter zake van de regeling van de schadevorderingen in overeenstemming met artikel VIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en met dit artikel beschouwd als en handelend als integrerende onderdelen van de betrokken krijgsmacht, tenzij wordt overeengekomen dat een zodanige organisatie in dit opzicht niet onttrokken zal zijn aan de Duitse rechtsmacht.   
8.  De aansprakelijkheid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst wordt niet beïnvloed door de omstandigheid, dat een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst onttrokken is aan de Duitse voorschriften. Indien de Duitse strijdkrachten dezelfde vrijstellingen genieten, behoeft alleen schadeloosstelling te worden betaald indien en voorzover een schadeloosstelling dient te worden betaald voor schade veroorzaakt door de Duitse strijdkrachten.   
9.  

a) Indien tengevolge van een voorval aan een derde schade is toegebracht die met toepassing van artikel VIII, vijfde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag wordt afgewikkeld en er tengevolge van hetzelfde voorval eveneens schade is toegebracht aan de betrokken staat van herkomst, worden, indien de derde aansprakelijk is voor het vergoeden van die schade, de vordering van de staat van herkomst en de vordering van de derde gecompenseerd.  

b) De Bondsrepubliek maakt in overeenstemming met administratieve overeenkomsten en op verzoek van een staat van herkomst namens die staat vorderingen geldend tegen in de Bondsrepubliek verblijvende personen, welke vorderingen voortvloeien uit schade die aldaar aan die staat is toegebracht; dit is niet van toepassing op vorderingen uit overeenkomst. De kosten die de Bondsrepubliek bij het geldend maken van vorderingen maakt worden, voorzover zij de algemene administratieve kosten te boven gaan, door de staat van herkomst vergoed.     
10.  Met betrekking tot vorderingen betreffende schade aan onroerende goederen of verlies van of schade aan roerende goederen - met uitzondering van onroerende of roerende goederen, die eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek of van een Land - die vóór 5 mei 1955 uitsluitend voor het gebruik door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst beschikbaar waren gesteld en die na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst door de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst zijn vrijgegeven, wordt de schadeloosstelling voor gelijke delen gedragen door de Bondsrepubliek en de betrokken staat van herkomst.   
11.  

a) Behalve in gevallen waarin het na navraag bij de daarvoor in aanmerking komende krijgsmachten niet mogelijk is vast te stellen wie van hen verantwoordelijk is voor het verlies of de schade, verstrekt de krijgsmacht een verklaring inzake de in artikel VIII, achtste lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag bedoelde vragen; zij neemt op verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten een zodanige verklaring opnieuw in beschouwing indien gedurende het onderzoek van een vordering een Duitse autoriteit of een Duitse rechtbank tot het inzicht mocht komen, dat er omstandigheden bestaan die tot een ander oordeel zouden kunnen leiden dan in de verklaring is neergelegd.  

b) Indien er een verschil van mening blijft bestaan dat niet kan worden opgelost door middel van nadere besprekingen tussen de twee partijen op hoger niveau, wordt de procedure gevolgd die is neergelegd in artikel VIII, achtste lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag.  

c) De Duitse autoriteiten of rechtbanken nemen hun beslissingen in overeenstemming met de verklaring onderscheidenlijk de beslissing van de arbiter.     
12.  

a) De bepalingen van artikel VIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van dit artikel zijn van toepassing op schaden die zijn veroorzaakt of worden geacht te zijn veroorzaakt na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst.  

b) Schaden die zijn veroorzaakt vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst of die worden geacht voordien te zijn veroorzaakt, worden behandeld in overeenstemming met de regelingen die tot dat tijdstip van toepassing waren.     
13.  Ter regeling van de tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten te volgen procedure bij de afwikkeling van schadevorderingen worden administratieve overeenkomsten gesloten.   

### Artikel  42  

Teneinde de belangen van de strijdkrachten ter zake van de veiligheid te verzekeren zijn de volgende bepalingen toepasselijk bij de controle op het maken van luchtfoto's: 

a) De Duitse autoriteiten stellen de autoriteiten van een krijgscht op hun verzoek in kennis van alle aanvragen om een vergunning tot het uitoefenen van een luchtfotografiebedrijf (Grundubnis) welke zij voornemens zijn in te willigen. Bij het nemen van een beslissing houden zij van geval tot geval rekening met het standpunt van de krijgsmacht.  

b) 

i) Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde onder iv van deze alinea zenden de Duitse autoriteiten aan de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht afschriften van alle aanvragen om vergunning tot het maken van foto's (Aufnahmeerlaubnisse) welke zij voornemens zijn in te willigen.  

ii) Indien de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht binnen tien dagen na ontvangst van een afschrift bezwaren indienen uit overwegingen van geheimhouding of veiligheid en indien overleg tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht niet tot een oplossing leidt, wordt de zaak onverwijld op een hoger niveau verder behandeld. De Duitse autoriteiten geven geen toestemming tot het fotograferen vanuit de lucht van installaties, uitrusting, troepenopstellingen en -verplaatsingen van een krijgsmacht, indien de autoriteiten van die krijgsmacht verklaren dat haar veiligheid daardoor in gevaar zou worden gebracht.  

iii) Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde onder iv van deze alinea geven de Duitse autoriteiten de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht op verzoek toestemming om de negatieven van luchtfoto's te onderzoeken en nemen zij, in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, ten aanzien van de negatieven die maatregelen welke noodzakelijk zijn in het belang van de geheimhouding en de veiligheid van installaties, uitrusting, troepenopstellingen of -verplaatsingen van die krijgsmacht.  

iv) De uitoefening van de onder i en iii van deze alinea bedoelde rechten van een krijgsmacht is beperkt tot de geografische gebieden, omschreven in met de Duitse autoriteiten te sluiten administratieve overeenkomsten.    

c) Niettegenstaande het onder *b*, sub ii bepaalde kunnen de Duitse autoriteiten na overleg met de autoriteiten van de onder *b*), sub iv bedoelde krijgsmacht een vergunning verlenen voor het maken van foto's, indien het fotograferen vanuit de lucht moet geschieden ten behoeve van topografische doeleinden in opdracht van een Duitse autoriteit. In dit geval dragen de Duitse autoriteiten er zorg voor, dat de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht als eersten inzage verkrijgen van de negatieven en dat de maatregelen welke de laatstgenoemde autoriteiten met betrekking tot die negatieven verzoeken ter waarborging van de geheimhouding of de veiligheid van installaties, uitrusting, troepenopstellingen of -verplaatsingen van die krijgsmacht, worden genomen.    

### Artikel  43  

1.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten verschaffen elkander alle voor de gemeenschappelijke verdediging van belang zijnde inlichtingen op het gebied van de meteorologie, geodesie, topografie, hydrografie en cartografie en wisselen te dien einde alle noodzakelijke gegevens uit.   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen, na de Duitse autoriteiten daarvan tijdig in kennis te hebben gesteld, in het belang van de gemeenschappelijke verdediging, topografische, geodetische, hydrografische of technische opnemingen of verkenningen verrichten, indien bijzondere redenen van veiligheid of geheimhouding dit noodzakelijk maken of indien de Duitse autoriteiten deze werkzaamheden niet in de vereiste omvang of binnen de vereiste tijd kunnen verrichten. Vertegenwoordigers van de Duitse autoriteiten kunnen bij het verrichten van deze werkzaamheden tegenwoordig zijn, tenzij bijzondere redenen van geheimhouding zich daartegen verzetten. De Duitse autoriteiten maken zonodig van de hun door de Duitse wetgeving verleende bevoegdheden gebruik teneinde voor de vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmacht verlof tot het betreden van terreinen te verkrijgen.   

### Artikel  44  

1.  Bij de oplossing van geschillen welke voortvloeien uit contracten die door de Duitse autoriteiten voor rekening van de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst zijn gesloten, werken deze autoriteiten voortdurend nauw samen, onafhankelijk van de vraag of deze geschillen al dan niet tot een rechtszaak aanleiding geven. Het vorenstaande is van overeenkomstige toepassing op geschillen, voortvloeiende uit arbeidsovereenkomsten, het recht inzake de werknemersvertegenwoordiging (Betriebsvertretungsrecht) of de sociale verzekering van burgerwerkkrachten van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst en op geschillen welke voortvloeien uit de rechtsgedingen, bedoeld in artikel 62, eerste lid, onder *c*. De nadere regeling van deze samenwerking wordt vastgelegd in administratieve overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voorzover de in het eerste lid bedoelde administratieve overeenkomsten betrekking hebben op rechtsgedingen tegen de Bondsrepubliek, zijn zij op de volgende beginselen gebaseerd: 

a) De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst worden onverwijld in kennis gesteld van de indiening van een eis en worden in alle essentiële stadia van de procedure geraadpleegd.  

b) De beslissing inzake het al dan niet instellen van beroep wordt slechts genomen in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst. Bij gebreke van overeenstemming tekenen de Duitse autoriteiten beroep aan indien een autoriteit van de krijgsmacht of - in voorkomend geval - van de civiele dienst, op het hoogste niveau verklaart, dat zij dit van essentieel belang acht. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst maken geen bezwaar tegen het instellen van beroep, indien een autoriteit van de Bondsrepubliek op het hoogste niveau verklaart dat dit voor haar van essentieel belang is. Voorzover de motieven welke ten grondslag liggen aan de verklaring omtrent het belang als bedoeld in de eerste en tweede volzin van dit punt in de loop van de onderhandelingen terzake van het instellen van beroep niet aan de andere partij bekend zijn geworden, worden ze op verzoek medegedeeld.     
3.  Het bepaalde in het tweede lid is van overeenkomstige toepassing op rechtsgedingen welke door de Bondsrepubliek aanhangig gemaakt worden, met dien verstande dat de beginselen, vervat in het tweede lid, onder *b* van toepassing zijn op de indiening van een eis.   
4.  Onafhankelijk van de vraag of ter zake van de geschillen als bedoeld in het eerste lid rechtsgedingen aanhangig zijn, beëindigen de Duitse autoriteiten dergelijke geschillen slechts in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst.   
5.  

a) De betrokken staat van herkomst neemt alle verplichtingen op zich en geniet alle voorrechten die op de Bondsrepubliek rusten, onderscheidenlijk aan de Bondsrepubliek toevallen krachtens in kracht van gewijsde gegane rechterlijke uitspraken (vollstreckbare Titel) gedaan in rechtsgedingen ter zake van geschillen als bedoeld in het eerste lid.  

b) Indien de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst tegen het indienen van een eis of het instellen van hoger beroep alleen daarom geen bezwaar maakt omdat een autoriteit van de Bondsrepubliek op het hoogste niveau heeft verklaard zulks van essentieel belang te achten, en op grond van de eis of het hoger beroep extra kosten in het rechtsgeding ontstaan, wordt van geval tot geval overeengekomen of en in hoeverre de als gevolg van dit rechtsgeding vastgestelde verplichtingen ten laste van de staat van herkomst of van de Bondsrepubliek komen.  

c) De kosten die voortvloeien uit een rechtszaak en die niet zijn begrepen in de kosten die door de rechtbank zijn vastgesteld, worden door de staat van herkomst betaald, indien de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst van te voren toestemming heeft gegeven de kosten te maken.     
6.  

a) Geschillen voortvloeiende uit levering van goederen en diensten die op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek uit hoofde van rechtstreeks door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst gesloten contracten geleverd zijn, worden beslecht door Duitse rechtbanken of door een onafhankelijk scheidsgerecht. Indien de Duitse rechtbanken het geschil moeten beslechten, wordt de eis ingediend tegen de Bondsrepubliek, die in eigen naam in het belang van de staat van herkomst in de zaak optreedt. Het tweede, vierde en vijfde lid van dit artikel zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing wat betreft de verhoudingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de staat van herkomst.  

b) De regelingen die tussen de Bondsrepubliek en een staat van herkomst zijn getroffen hebben evenwel voorrang boven de bepalingen vermeld onder *a*.     

### Artikel  45  

1.  Voorzover een krijgsmacht haar oefenprogramma niet kan uitvoeren op de haar voor onbepaalde tijd voor gebruik ter beschikking gestelde onroerende goederen, zonder aan de oefeningsdoeleinden afbreuk te doen, heeft de krijgsmacht het recht om buiten deze goederen manoeuvres en andere oefeningen te houden van een omvang als nodig is ter vervulling van haar verdedigingstaak en die overeenstemt met eventuele opdrachten of aanbevelingen van de Geallieerde Opperbevelhebber in Europa of van enige andere bevoegde autoriteit van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie. Behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede tot en met het zevende lid wordt de uitoefening van dit recht beheerst door de bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving met betrekking tot manoeuvres en andere oefeningen.   
2.  

a) Een krijgsmacht neemt alle maatregelen welke noodzakelijk zijn om te verzekeren dat tijdens de manoeuvres of andere oefeningen het aanrichten van schade zoveel mogelijk vermeden wordt en de economische exploitatie van terreinen (Grundstücke) niet in belangrijke mate wordt geschaad.  

b) De krijgsmacht maakt gedurende een periode van drie maanden niet opnieuw gebruik van een terrein waaraan tengevolge van een manoeuvre of andere oefening aanzienlijke schade is toegebracht, tenzij de Duitse autoriteiten daarvoor toestemming geven.  

c) Indien tengevolge van een manoeuvre of een andere oefening economische exploitatie van een terrein in belangrijke mate is geschaad, houdt de krijgsmacht op dit terrein geen manoeuvres of andere oefeningen zolang gevreesd moet worden dat daardoor de economische exploitatie van dat terrein verder of opnieuw in belangrijke mate geschaad zal worden.  

d) Indien de Duitse autoriteiten bezwaren maken tegen het gebruik van een bepaald terrein omdat het gebruik daarvan op grond van het bepaalde in dit lid onder *b* of *c* is verboden, treden zij, op verzoek van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, in onderhandelingen over het gebruik van een ander terrein dat voldoet aan de oefeningseisen van de krijgsmacht. Zij houden bij de onderhandelingen zowel met de Duitse belangen als met de militaire eisen rekening.  

e) Bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving, ingevolge welke eenzelfde terrein (Gelände) slechts in uitzonderingsgevallen meer dan eenmaal drie maanden gebruikt mag worden voor meerdaagse oefeningen, zijn niet van toepassing op een krijgsmacht.     
3.  Voorzover het om militaire redenen onvermijdelijk is dat een krijgsmacht gebruik maakt van een natuurreservaat of een natuurmonument of gedeelten daarvan, treft de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek, indien de rechthebbende niet in dat gebruik toestemt, met de Regering van de staat van herkomst een regeling, waarin het natuurreservaat of het natuurmonument, of gedeelten daarvan, zijn omschreven en waarin, voorzover nodig, de bijzonderheden van het gebruik zijn vastgelegd. De krijgsmacht mag, in overeenstemming met de getroffen regeling, het natuurreservaat, het natuurmonument, of gedeelten daarvan, zonder toestemming van de rechthebbende gebruiken.   
4.  Indien de Duitse autoriteiten, in plaats van een gebied dat de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht op het oog hebben voor het houden van een manoeuvre of een andere oefening, een ander gebied voorstellen dat voldoet aan de opleidingseisen van de krijgsmacht, houdt de krijgsmacht de manoeuvre of andere oefening niet op het aanvankelijk beoogde gebied.   
5.  

a) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht stellen de Duitse autoriteiten zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis van hun programma's inzake manoeuvres en andere oefeningen.  

b) Voor het begin van een manoeuvre of andere oefening leggen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht binnen een termijn die in overleg tussen de Bondsregering en de Regeringen van de staten van herkomst wordt vastgesteld aan de Duitse autoriteiten een plan inzake de uitvoering van de manoeuvre of andere oefening voor, vergezeld van de nodige gegevens en toelichtingen en bespreken dit plan met de Duitse autoriteiten, zo deze daarom verzoeken. Dit plan bevat in het bijzonder gegevens omtrent aard, tijdstip van aanvang, duur en plaats van de oefeningen en geeft aan of openbare wegen geheel of gedeeltelijk afgesloten of, op een wijze die met de Duitse wetgeving in strijd is, gebruikt moeten worden en zo dit laatste het geval is, welke veiligheidsmaatregelen zullen worden genomen. Wanneer in verband met de manoeuvre of andere oefening gebruik gemaakt wordt van luchtvaartuigen, bevat het plan ook bijzonderheden omtrent het gebruik hiervan; artikel 46 blijft onverminderd van kracht.  

c) Indien de Duitse autoriteiten binnen een terrein, vastgesteld in overleg tussen de Bondsregering en de Regering van een staat van herkomst, geen bezwaren inbrengen tegen het plan, kunnen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht er van uitgaan dat er geen bezwaren tegen bestaan.  

d) Indien de Duitse autoriteiten bezwaren inbrengen tegen een plan, worden onverwijld pogingen in het werk gesteld om door gezamenlijk overleg tot overeenstemming te geraken. Hierbij wordt zowel met de Duitse belangen als met de militaire eisen rekening gehouden.  

e) Indien de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht inzake een plan noch op plaatselijk noch op regionaal niveau n een redelijke termijn tot overeenstemming komen, wordt op verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten of van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht het overleg voortgezet tussen de Bondsregering en de Regering van de staat van herkomst, teneinde tot overeenstemming geraken.  

f) Indien de Bondsregering en de Regering van de staat van herkomst inzake een plan niet binnen een redelijke termijn tot overeenstemming komen, kunnen beide regeringen de zaak aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie voorleggen met het verzoek zijn advies te willen geven inzake de vraag of de voorgenomen manoeuvre of andere oefening van primair belang is voor de vervulling van de verdedigingstaak van de krijgsmacht en in overeenstemming is met de in het kader van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie vastgestelde richtlijnen. Met dit advies wordt tijdens de verdere besprekingen tussen de regeringen naar behoren rekening gehouden.  

g) De krijgsmacht houdt de manoeuvre of andere oefening overeenkomstig de over het plan bereikte overeenstemming.       
6.  

a) Nadat over een plan overeenstemming is bereikt, stellen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht de Duitse autoriteiten zo tijdig in kennis van hun voornemen de manoeuvre of andere oefening te houden, dat de Duitse autoriteiten in staat zijn de manoeuvre of andere oefening ten minste twee weken voor het begin daarvan aan te kondigen.  

b) Indien de Duitse autoriteiten om belangrijke redenen, die tijdens de besprekingen over het plan niet waren voorzien, bezwaren maken tegen het houden van een manoeuvre of andere oefening in een bepaald gebied of op een bepaald tijdstip, in het bijzonder omdat de manoeuvre of andere oefening de openbare orde en veiligheid of de openbare gezondheid in gevaar zou brengen of als gevolg van de weersgesteldheid aanzienlijke schade zou veroorzaken, worden onverwijld pogingen in het werk gesteld om door gezamenlijk overleg, waarbij met deze redenen naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden, tot overeenstemming te geraken.  

c) De plaatselijke Duitse autoriteiten leggen beperkende voorwaarden die zij ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving in afzonderlijke gevallen kunnen opleggen (artikel 66, eerste lid van de Bondsvorderingswet), voorzover een krijgsmacht daarbij betrokken is, slechts op in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht.     
7.  Teneinde een doeltreffende coördinatie van de civiele en militaire belangen bij de toepassing van dit artikel te verzekeren, kunnen de Bondsregering en de Regering van een staat van herkomst besluiten tot het instellen van een Permanente Commissie.   

### Artikel  46  

1.  Een krijgsmacht heeft het recht manoeuvres en andere oefeningen in het luchtruim te houden van een omvang als nodig is ter vervulling van haar verdedigingstaak en die overeenstemt met eventuele opdrachten of aanbevelingen van de Geallieerde Opperbevelhebber in Europa of van enige andere bevoegde autoriteit van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie. Behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede tot en met het zesde lid, wordt de uitoefening van dit: recht beheerst door de Duitse voorschriften met betrekking tot het gebruik van het luchtruim en van luchtvaartinstallaties en -inrichtingen welke vallen binnen het kader van de Normen en Aanbevolen Werkwijzen van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie.   
2.  Zonder speciale toestemming van de rechthebbenden en van de Duitse autoriteiten mag een krijgsmacht vliegvelden die haar niet uitsluitend voor haar gebruik beschikbaar zijn gesteld niet tijdelijk bezetten of sluiten. Hetzelfde geldt voor de installaties die bestemd zijn om de luchtverkeersveiligheid te verzekeren.   
3.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten wijzen gemeenschappelijk gebieden aan waarboven op geringere hoogte gevlogen mag worden dan normaal is toegestaan.   
4.  De Duitse autoriteiten worden tijdig in kennis gesteld van manoeuvres en andere oefeningen in het luchtruim waarbij het onder controle staande luchtruim betrokken is en waarvoor de normale vliegveiligheidsprocedure niet gevolgd kan worden of die de uitgifte van een navigatiewaarschuwing eisen. De procedure inzake deze kennisgeving richt zich naar de besluiten van de Permanente Luchtvaart-Coördinatie-Commissie of het orgaan dat daarvoor eventueel in de plaats komt.   
5.  Indien de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de luchtverkeersleidingsautoriteiten niet binnen een redelijke termijn overeenstemming bereiken over bepaalde coördinatiemaatregelen, wordt de aangelegenheid voorgelegd aan de Permanente Luchtvaart-Coördinatie-Commissie of het orgaan dat daarvoor eventueel in de plaats komt.   
6.  De bepalingen van artikel 45 zijn zowel van toepassing op landingen buiten de luchtvaartterreinen als op parachutesprongen of het afwerpen van voorwerpen per parachute op terreinen die niet voor permanent gebruik ter beschikking van een krijgsmacht zijn gesteld.   

### Artikel  47  

1.  Terzake van de levering van goederen en diensten doet de Bondsrepubliek aan een krijgsmacht en aan een civiele dienst een behandeling ten deel vallen die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke de Duitse strijdkrachten ontvangen.   
2.  Met het oog op de maatregelen die eventueel ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel IX van het N.A.V.O.-Status Verdrag, tweede lid, tweede volzin, noodzakelijk blijken, delen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst aan de Duitse autoriteiten - indien deze dit verzoeken - hun behoeften op bepaalde gebieden van de bevoorrading mede.   
3.  Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst kan zich de goederen en diensten die hij nodig heeft hetzij rechtstreeks hetzij - na voorafgaande afspraak - door bemiddeling van de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten verschaffen.   
4.  Indien de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst zich rechtstreeks goederen en diensten verschaffen, 

a) kunnen zij de bij hen gebruikelijke procedure volgen, mits met inachtneming van de in de Bondsrepubliek geldende beginselen met betrekking tot aanschaffingen voor de openbare diensten, welke beginselen zijn neergelegd in de voorschriften inzake de mededinging, preferente inschrijvers en de prijzen die van toepassing zijn op aanffingen voor de openbare diensten.  

b) bestellen zij de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van de aard en de omvang van de bestelling, de naam van de leverancier en de overeengekomen prijs, tenzij het bestellingen van ondergeschikt belang betreft.     
5.  Indien de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst zich goederen en diensten verschaffen door bemiddeling van de Duitse autoriteiten 

a) delen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst hun behoeften tijdig en in bijzonderheden mede aan de Duitse autoriteiten, onder vermelding met name van de technische specificaties en de bijzondere voorwaarden inzake aflevering en betaling;  

b) worden de contracten met betrekking tot goederen en diensten gesloten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de leveranciers; de Duitse wettelijke en administratieve voorschriften inzake aanschaffingen voor de openbare dienst zijn van toepassing;  

c) staan de Duitse autoriteiten - onverminderd hun uitsluitende bevoegdheid tegenover de leverancier - aan de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst toe, deel te nemen aan het sluiten en uitvoeren van contracten voorzover dit nodig is om hun belangen voldoende tot hun recht te doen komen; in het bijzonder worden geen contracten gesloten of gewijzigd zonder schriftelijke toestemming van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst; de afname van goederen en diensten geschiedt gemeenschappelijk, tenzij anders overeengekomen is;  

d) betaalt de staat van herkomst aan de Bondsrepubliek terug: 

i) alle uitgaven die volgens de Duitse wetgeving met betrekking tot aanschaffingen voor de openbare dienst ten laste komen van de Bondsrepubliek, met dien verstande dat uitgaven tengevolge van een buitengerechtelijk akkoord alleen worden terugbetaald indien de krijgsmacht in het sluiten van het akkoord heeft toegestemd;  

ii) onverplichte betalingen gedaan met toestemming van de krijgsmacht;  

iii) uitgaven voortvloeiende uit maatregelen door de Duitse autoriteiten in noodgevallen genomen ter bescherming van de belangen van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, voorzover deze uitgaven niet ten laste gebracht kunnen worden van de leverancier;    

e) stellen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en van de civiele dienst de noodzakelijke geldmiddelen zo tijdig beschikbaar, dat de talingen op de vervaldagen kunnen plaatsvinden;  

f) zijn de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst gerechtigd om op een nader overeen te komen wijze de bescheiden met betrekking tot betalingen verricht door de daartoe bevoegde Duitse instanties te verifiëren;  

g) de details van de in dit lid onder *a*, *c*, *d*, *e* en *f* bedoelde procedures worden geregeld bij administratieve overeenkomsten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, in het bijzonder ter verzekering van een uitvoering van de aanschaffingsprocedure binnen de gestelde termijn.     

### Artikel  48  

1.  

a) Aan de behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst aan onroerende goederen wordt slechts voldaan in overeenstemming met het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

b) De behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst aan onroerende goederen worden door middel van periodiek in te dienen schema's ter kennis gebracht van de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek. Buiten deze schema's delen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht slechts in noodgevallen hun behoeften aan onroerende goederen mede. Deze mededelingen behelzen door de krijgsmacht vastgestelde gedetailleerde gegevens die in het bijzonder betrekking ben op de bij benadering aangegeven ligging van het gebied, de omvang, het voorgestelde gebruik, de geschatte duur van de behoefte en de data waarop de onroerende goederen ter beschikking moeten worden gesteld.  

c) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst sluiten met de Duitse autoriteiten overeenkomsten inzake de voorziening in hun behoeften aan onroerende goederen. Deze overeenkomsten strekken zich tevens uit tot de toegang tot de onroerende goederen (wegen, spoorwegen of waterwegen) en, bij voorkomende gevallen, tot de kosten bedoeld in artikel 63, vijfde lid onder *b*. De Duitse autoriteiten voeren de ingevolge deze overeenkomsten te treffen maatregelen uit.  

d) De Duitse autoriteiten wijzen op verzoek de ondernemingen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de levering aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst van water, gas en elektriciteit of voor de afvoer van afvalwater, met welke ondernemingen contracten kunnen worden gesloten. Voorzover aan de behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst niet kan worden voldaan door middel van contracten tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst en de betrokken ondernemingen, wordt inzake de voldoening deze behoeften een overeenkomst gesloten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, indien laatstgenoemden zulks verzoeken. De Duitse autoriteiten nemen passende maatregelen om de nakoming van deze overeenkomst te verzekeren, zo nodig door het sluiten van contracten.     
2.  De Bondsrepubliek waarborgt dat de aan een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst binnen het kader van de bepalingen van het Krijgsmachtenverdrag voor haar gebruik ter beschikking gestelde onroerende goederen die bij de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag nog in haar bezit zijn, ter beschikking blijven van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst totdat deze goederen op grond van het vijfde lid onder *a* en *b* van dit artikel dienen te worden teruggegeven. Het vorenstaande is niet van toepassing op onroerende goederen bestemd voor openbaar vervoer of voor de hiervoor gebruikte bevoorradingsinrichtingen of voor de posterijen en de telecommunicatiedienst; deze onroerende goederen worden teruggegeven voorzover niet anders is overeengekomen tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht,   
3.  

a) Met betrekking tot de overeenkomstig het eerste lid aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst beschikbaar te stellen onroerende goederen worden speciale schriftelijke overeenkomsten (Überlassungsvereinbarungen) gesloten; deze overeenkomsten bevatten gegevens betreffende de omvang, de aard, de plaats, de toestand en de inventaris van de onroerende goederen, alsmede bijzonderheden betreffende het gebruik ervan. De onroerende goederen worden uitsluitend aan de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst die de goederen heeft aangevraagd, voor bezetting en gebruik ter beschikking gesteld voorzover niet anders is overeengekomen tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst.  

b) Het onder *a* gestelde van dit lid is van overeenkomstige toepassing op onroerende goederen die overeenkomstig het tweede lid beschikking blijven van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst,     
4.  Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst is verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering van de herstel- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden die nodig zijn om de ter beschikking gestelde goederen in goede staat van onderhoud te houden, tenzij met betrekking tot de tegen betaling ter beschikking gestelde onroerende goederen in de overeenkomsten gesloten ingevolge het derde lid onder *a*, anders is bepaald.   
5.  De volgende bepalingen zijn van toepassing op de teruggave van onroerende goederen door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst. 

a) 

i) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst controleren voortdurend hun behoeften aan onroerende goederen, teneinde te verzekeren dat het aantal en de omvang van de door hen gebruikte onroerende goederen beperkt worden tot het minimaal vereiste. Bovendien verifiëren zij op verzoek van de Duitse autoriteiten hun behoeften in individuele gevallen. Behoudens eventuele bijzondere overeenkomsten inzake de duur van het gebruik worden onroerende goederen die niet langer nodig zijn of waarvoor andere onroerende goederen die aan de behoeften van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst voldoen ter beschikking zijn gesteld, na voorafgaande kennisgeving onverwijld aan de Duitse autoriteiten teruggegeven.  

ii) Het gestelde in i is van overeenkomstige toepassing indien een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst niet meer het gehele onroerende goed nodig heeft en een gedeeltelijke teruggave mogelijk is.    

b) Behoudens het gestelde onder *a* houden de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst naar behoren rekening met verzoeken van de Duitse autoriteiten om teruggave van een speciaal onroerend goed wanneer het, gelet op de gemeenschappelijke verdedigingstaak, duidelijk is dat het Duitse belang bij het gebruik van een dergelijk onroerend goed overheerst.  

c) Onroerende goederen die na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst voor een bepaalde termijn aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst ter beschikking zijn gesteld, worden na afloop van die termijn teruggegeven, mits deze tijdsduur werd vastgesteld overeenkomstig de verklaringen door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of civiele dienst verstrekt op het tijdstip dat zij hun behoefte aan onroerende goederen mededeelden; de tijdsduur van het gebruik mag worden verlengd voorzover de eigenaar of andere rechthebbende er in toestemt dan wel vordering is toegestaan ingevolge de Duitse vorderings (Leistungs) wetgeving.  

d) Onroerende goederen die na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst ter beschikking zijn gesteld en ten aanzien waarvan een autoriteit die belast is met de onteigening krachtens de Wet inzake de verwerving van terreinen een voorlopige bezitstoewijzing (vorzeitige Besitzeinweisung) heeft afgegeven, worden teruggegeven indien deze eigendomstoewijzing wordt ingetrokken.  

e) Voorwerpen die te zamen met onroerende goederen zijn gevorrd en die zich nog in deze onroerende goederen bevinden worden gelijk met de onroerende goederen teruggegeven, tenzij de eigenaar met een andere regeling instemt.     

### Artikel  49  

1.  De programma's betreffende de bouwplannen die noodzakelijk zijn om aan de behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst te voldoen worden overeengekomen tussen de inzake het Bondsbouwprogramma bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst.   
2.  De bouwwerkzaamheden worden in de regel uitgevoerd door de inzake het Bondsbouwprogramma bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten overeenkomstig de geldende Duitse wettelijke bepalingen en administratieve voorschriften en overeenkomstig bijzondere administratieve overeenkomsten.   
3.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst kunnen na overleg met de Duitse autoriteiten bouwwerkzaamheden met hun eigen personeel uitvoeren of met toepassing van de normale procedures rechtstreeks contracten sluiten met leveranciers voor 

a) bouwwerken van geringe omvang; en  

b) bij uitzondering in andere gevallen,   overeenkomstig bijzondere administratieve overeenkomsten die eventueel gelden op de dag van inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst of die daarna worden gesloten of gewijzigd. Bij de uitvoering van deze werken leven de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst de Duitse bouwvoorschriften na en houden rekening met de beginselen die in de Bondsrepubliek met betrekking tot openbare werken van toepassing zijn en die zijn neergelegd in de voorschriften inzake mededinging, preferente inschrijvers en de prijzen die van toepassing zijn op aanschaffingen voor de openbare dienst.   
4.  Herstel- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden die noodzakelijk zijn om aan de behoeften van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst te voldoen, worden uitgevoerd door hetzij de Duitse autoriteiten, hetzij, na overleg met die autoriteiten, door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst. In het laatste geval zijn de bepalingen van het derde lid van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
5.  De vorm en de omvang van het in het derde en vierde lid bedoelde overleg worden overeengekomen tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst en de Duitse autoriteiten.   
6.  Indien de in het tweede en vierde lid van dit artikel bedoelde werkzaamheden voor rekening van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst worden uitgevoerd door de Duitse autoriteiten, 

a) kunnen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst wanneer zij zulks noodzakelijk achten deelnemen aan het ontwerpen van de plannen of zelf de plannen en bestekken verstrekken;  

b) wordt de wijze van aanbesteding en, in het geval van ondershandse aanbesteding, het aantal en de namen van de uit te nodigen aannemers, overeengekomen tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst;  

c) geschiedt de gunning eerst nadat de autoriteiten van de krijgsht of van de civiele dienst hun schriftelijke goedkeuring hebben gegeven;  

d) wordt aan de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst toegestaan deel te nemen aan inspecties van bouwwerken en hebben zij toegang tot bouwplannen en alle daarop betrekking hebe bescheiden en afrekeningen;  

e) verstrekken de Duitse autoriteiten, tenzij anders is overeengen, aan de aannemers slechts dan een verklaring van een genoeguitvoering van belangrijke onderdelen van het werk indien de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst daarmee instemmen; in het bijzonder moeten de Duitse autoriteiten de schriftelijke goedkeuring van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst verkrijgen alvorens de aannemer van zijn contractuele verplichtingen te ontslaan;  

f) betaalt de staat van herkomst de Bondsrepubliek terug 

i) alle uitgaven die volgens de Duitse wetgeving met betrekking tot de aanschaffingen voor de openbare dienst ten laste komen van de Bondsrepubliek, met dien verstande dat uitgaven tengevolge van een buitengerechtelijk akkoord alleen worden terugbetaald indien de krijgsmacht in het sluiten van dit akkoord heeft toegestemd;  

ii) onverplichte betalingen gedaan met toestemming van de krijgsmacht;  

iii) uitgaven voortvloeiende uit maatregelen door de Duitse autoriteiten in noodgevallen genomen ter bescherming van de belangen van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, voor zover deze uitgaven niet ten laste gebracht kunnen worden van de aannemer;    

g) stellen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst de noodzakelijke geldmiddelen zo tijdig beschikbaar dat de betalingen op de vervaltermijnen kunnen plaatsvinden;  

h) zijn de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst gerechtigd om op een nader overeen te komen wijze de bescheiden met betrekking tot betalingen verricht door de daartoe bevoegde Duitse instanties te verifiëren:  

i) stellen de staten van herkomst de Duitse autoriteiten overeenkomstig administratieve overeenkomsten, schadeloos ten aanzien van bjzondere diensten door de laatstgenoemden in verband met de uitvoering van de bouwwerkzaamheden (bouwplannen, toezicht en inspectie) geleverd.     

### Artikel  50  

Tot de inrichting en inboedel behorende goederen die eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek kunnen binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek van een bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in gebruik zijnd onroerend goed naar een ander worden overgebracht, met inachtneming van de volgende beperkingen: 

a) Voorwerpen van deze aard - met inbegrip van die welke zijn aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of van middelen voor het onderhoud van de krijgsmachten - die in de bouwkosten van de bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in gebruik zijnde onroerende goederen waren begrepen, worden slechts met toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten van zodanige onroerende goederen verwijderd.  

b) De toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten dient eveneens te worden verkregen voordat tot de inrichting en inboedel behorende goederen die bevestigd zijn aan, of speciaal gemaakt zijn voor, een bepaald onroerend goed, worden verwijderd. Het vorenstaande is niet van toepassing indien zodanige voorwerpen werden aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of van middelen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten; de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst stellen de Duitse autoriteiten echter tijdig van hun voornemen in kennis teneinde laatstgenoemde autoriteiten in voorkomend geval in staat te stellen een andere oplossing voor te stellen.    

### Artikel  51  

1.  Roerende goederen die zijn aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of van middelen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten worden, wanneer de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst vaststellen dat zij die goederen niet meer nodig hebben, overgedragen aan de Duitse autoriteiten, te hunner beschikking.   
2.  In afwijking van het gestelde in het eerste lid kunnen overeenkomsten worden gesloten met betrekking tot de verkoop of andere wijzen van tegeldemaking van deze roerende goederen. De nettoopbrengsten van deze tegeldemaking komen ten bate van de Bondsrepubliek.   
3.  Roerende goederen als bedoeld in het eerste lid kunnen slechts uit het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek worden verwijderd indien zulks noodzakelijk is in verband met de vervulling van de verdedigingstaak van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie. Onder voorbehoud van het gestelde in het vierde lid wordt de verwijdering beheerst door de volgende bepalingen: 

a) Voordat de verwijdering plaatsvindt wordt hiervan aan de Duitse autoriteiten mededeling gedaan; in spoedgevallen vindt de mededeling achteraf plaats.  

b) Mededeling aan de Duitse autoriteiten is niet vereist in het geval van 

i) verwijdering van voorwerpen met een geringe aanschaffingswaarde;  

ii) tijdelijke verwijdering van voorwerpen in verband met manoeuvres of andere handelingen van een krijgsmacht die veelvuldige en herhaalde overschrijdingen van de grenzen van de Bondsrepubliek vereisen.       
4.  Elke verwijdering van goederen bedoeld in het eerste lid in verband met de verplaatsing van onderdelen van een krijgsmacht, die tot doel heeft de krijgsmacht te verkleinen of geheel terug te trekken wordt geregeld in een bijzondere overeenkomst.   
5.  Het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel blijven van kracht in de gevallen dat verwijdering uit het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek plaatsvindt; zij zijn eveneens van toepassing wanneer de roerende goederen bedoeld in het eerste lid niet meer noodzakelijk zijn voor de vervulling van de verdedigingstaak van de N.A.V.O.   
6.  Tot de inrichting en inboedel behorende goederen die deel uitmaken van onroerende goederen en zijn aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten of van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of van middelen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten, worden niet uit het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek verwijderd.   
7.  De bijzonderheden worden bij administratieve overeenkomsten geregeld.   

### Artikel  52  

1.  Indien een staat van herkomst voornemens is onroerende goederen of andere vermogensbestanddelen die rechtens eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek of van een Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) en die de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld, geheel of gedeeltelijk terug te geven, wordt een overeenkomst gesloten tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst en de Duitse autoriteken met betrekking tot de eventuele op het tijdstip van teruggave bestaande restwaarde van verbeteringen welke de staat van herkomst ten laste van eigen fondsen heeft aangebracht. De Bondsrepubliek betaalt de overeengekomen restwaarde aan de staat van herkomst terug. Het gestelde in de eerste en tweede volzin is eveneens van toepassing op uitrusting en voorraden die de staat van herkomst uit eigen middelen heeft aangeschaft en die ingevolge overeenkomst bij deze onroerende goederen moeten achterblijven.   
2.  Betaling ingevolge het eerste lid wordt niet verricht tot het bedrag waarvoor ingevolge artikel 41 schadevergoeding voor schade door de staat van herkomst toegebracht aan onroerende goederen of andere vermogensbestanddelen moet worden betaald of zou moeten zijn betaald, indien geen afstand van de vordering tot schadevergoeding was gedaan dan wel indien de staat van herkomst niet van haar aansprakelijkheid voor zodanige vorderingen ingevolge genoemd artikel was bevrijd.   
3.  Een staat van herkomst is niet verplicht aangebrachte verbeteringen, uitrustingsgoederen of voorraden van onroerende goederen of andere voorwerpen die rechtens eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek of van een Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) te verwijderen. Indien de onroerende goederen of andere voorwerpen rechtens eigendom zijn van een Land, vrijwaart de Bondsrepubliek de staat van herkomst voor de aansprakelijkheid voor alle vorderingen die aan het Land ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving, op grond van de omstandigheid dat deze verwijdering niet plaatsvindt, toekomen.   
4.  Een staat van herkomst dient geen vordering in met betrekking tot de restwaarde van verbeteringen aangebracht aan goederen bedoeld in het eerste lid of met betrekking tot verbeteringen van goederen die voor het gebruik van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst om niet ter beschikking zijn gesteld en die eigendom zijn van rechtspersonen waarin de Bondsrepubliek of een Land financieel deelnemen, indien de verbeteringen zijn bekostigd uit middelen die door de Bondsrepubliek of een Land aan de staat van herkomst ter beschikking zijn gesteld. Het vorenstaande tast de verrekening van de restwaarde van die verbeteringen met de schadeloosstelling voor schade toegebracht tijdens het gebruik van deze goederen door de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst of bij de verwijdering van deze verbeteringen, niet aan.   

### Artikel  53  

1.  Een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst kunnen binnen onroerende goederen, die voor hun uitsluitend gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld, alle noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen ten behoeve van een genoegzame vervulling van hun verdedigingsverplichtingen. De krijgsmacht kan binnen deze onroerende goederen haar eigen voorschriften op het gebied van de openbare orde en veiligheid toepassen, indien deze voorschriften gelijke of hogere maatstaven inhouden, dan die vervat in de Duitse wetgeving.   
2.  De eerste volzin van het eerste lid is van overeenkomstige toepassing op maatregelen met betrekking tot het luchtruim boven de onroerende goederen, mits de maatregelen die het luchtverkeer zouden kunnen hinderen slechts worden genomen in overleg met de Duitse autoriteiten. De bepalingen van artikel 57, zevende lid blijven van kracht.   
3.  De krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst draagt er bij de uitvoering van de maatregelen bedoeld in het eerste lid zorg voor, dat de Duitse autoriteiten binnen de onroerende goederen de noodzakelijke maatregelen kunnen nemen teneinde de Duitse belangen te waarborgen.   
4.  De Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst werken samen teneinde een soepele toepassing van de maatregelen bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid te verzekeren. De bijzonderheden van deze samenwerking zijn uitgewerkt in het vijfde tot en met het zevende lid van het op dit artikel betrekking hebbende onderdeel van het Protocol van ondertekening,   
5.  Wanneer onroerende goederen gezamenlijk worden gebruikt door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst en de Duitse strijdkrachten of Duitse civiele diensten worden de met betrekking tot dit gebruik nodige regelingen vastgelegd in administratieve overeenkomsten of bijzondere overeenkomsten waarbij zowel met de positie van de Bondsrepubliek als ontvangende Staat als met de verdedigingsverplichtingen van de krijgsmacht naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden.   
6.  Teneinde een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in staat te stellen hun verdedigingsverplichtingen op genoegzame wijze te vervullen, nemen de Duitse autoriteiten op verzoek van de krijgsmacht passende maatregelen 

a) ter vaststelling van gebieden waarin de rechten van de grondeigenaar kunnen worden beperkt (Schutzbereiche),  

b) voor de controle op of de beperking van de bebouwing, de beplanting en het verkeer in de omgeving van onroerende goederen die voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld van de krijgsmacht.     

### Artikel  54  

1.  De Duitse voorschriften ter voorkoming en bestrijding van besmettelijke ziekten bij mensen, dieren en planten, alsmede ter voorkoming van de verbreiding en ter bestrijding van voor planten schadelijke insekten zijn van toepassing op een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, voorzover de terzake geldende voorschriften van de krijgsmacht geen gelijke of hogere maatstaven inhouden. Een krijgsmacht mag binnen de onroerende goederen die voor haar gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld haar eigen voorschriften toepassen, mits noch de volksgezondheid (öffentliche Gesundheit) noch de plantenteelt daardoor in gevaar wordt gebracht.   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten delen elkander terstond mede het uitbreken of vermoedelijk uitbreken, de ontwikkeling en de afloop van een besmettelijke ziekte, alsmede de genomen maatregelen.   
3.  Indien de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht het noodzakelijk achten om ten behoeve van de bescherming van de gezondheid maatregelen te treffen in de omgeving van voor haar gebruik ter beschikking gestelde onroerende goederen, sluiten zij terzake van de uitvoering van deze maatregelen overeenkomsten met de Duitse autoriteiten.   
4.  Indien de Duitse wetgeving de invoer van bepaalde artikelen verbiedt, kunnen deze artikelen met goedkeuring van de Duitse autoriteiten en mits noch de volksgezondheid noch de plantenteelt daardoor in gevaar wordt gebracht, door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht worden ingevoerd. De Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht sluiten overeenkomsten inzake de categorieën artikelen waarvan de invoer door de Duitse autoriteiten in de zin van dit artikel is goedgekeurd.   
5.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht kunnen met goedkeuring van de Duitse autoriteiten, het onderzoek en de controle van de door hen ingevoerde artikelen uitvoeren. Zij dragen er zorg voor dat noch de volksgezondheid noch de plantenteelt als gevolg van de invoer van die artikelen in gevaar wordt gebracht.   

### Artikel  55  

1.  

a) Verdedigingswerken die voor de uitvoering van NAVO-plannen ten behoeve van de gemeenschappelijke verdediging noodzakelijk zijn binnen de gebieden voor de verdediging waarvan de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht verantwoordelijk zijn, worden, overeenkomstig tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek bereikte overeenstemming, ontworpen en uitgevoerd.  

b) De werken worden door de Duitse autoriteiten in overleg met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht uitgevoerd.   Indien echter een bijzondere noodzaak voor geheimhouding of beveiliging aanwezig is, heeft de krijgsmacht het recht, na passend overleg en op plaatsen waarover met de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek overeenstemming is bereikt, deze werken met eigen personeel of met niet-Duitse deskundigen uit te voeren.   
2.  De autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht werken samen om te verzekeren dat de maatregelen die nodig zijn om te voldoen aan de verdedigingsbehoefte op een bevredigende wijze en tijdig worden voorbereid en uitgevoerd.   

### Artikel  56  

1.  

a) De Duitse arbeidswetgeving, zoals die geldt voor burgerwerknemers in dienst bij de Duitse strijdkrachten, met uitzondering van de dienstreglementen (Dienstordnungen) en van de tariefregelingen, is van toepassing op de indienstneming van burgerwerknemers bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, tenzij in deze Overeenkomsten anders is bepaald.  

b) Indien iemand solliciteert bij een autoriteit van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, is uitsluitend hij ervoor verantwoordelijk om, indien zulks wordt geëist, het bewijs te leveren dat hij niet is veroordeeld voor enig strafbaar feit. Indien de sollicitant geen verklaring van goed gedrag (polizeiliches Führungszeugnis) kan verkrijgen, verstrekken de Duitse autoriteiten hem, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving, een uittreksel uit het strafregister, indien hij een verklaring toont van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst dat hij heeft gesolliciteerd naar een betrekking en indien de afgifte van een dergelijk uittreksel geen wezenlijke Duitse belangen in gevaar brengt.  

c) Onverminderd hun aanspraak op beloning hebben de burgerwerknemers geen recht op daadwerkelijke tewerkstelling.  

d) Voor overplaatsingen om reden van dienst binnen de Bondsrepubliek is de schriftelijke toestemming van de burgerwerknemer nodig; zulk een toestemming kan op elk moment gegeven worden.  

e) Een krijgsmacht heeft het recht niet-Duitse burgerwerknemers en te brengen om burgerlijke dienstorganisaties te formeren.  

f) De burgerwerknemers die in dienstbetrekking zijn bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst worden niet geacht in dienstbetrekking te zijn bij de Duitse openbare dienst.     
2.  Indien een Duitse rechter in arbeidszaken beslist dat een arbeidsovereenkomst niet is geëindigd door opzegging, stelt hij ambtshalve de schadeloosstelling vast die moet worden betaald indien de voortzetting van het dienstverband wordt geweigerd. Het vorenstaande geldt niet alleen voor acties ingesteld om bescherming tegen ontslag te verkrijgen (Kündigungsschutzverfahren), doch ook voor andere acties ingesteld hetzij om een declaratoire uitspraak (Feststellungsklage) te verkrijgen, hetzij om de nakoming van een bepaalde uit de arbeidsovereenkomst voortvloeiende verplichting te eisen (Leistungsklage). Het bedrag van de schadeloosstelling wordt vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de Duitse arbeidswetgeving. De arbeidsovereenkomst wordt geacht te zijn beëindigd na een weigering het dienstverband voort te zetten. Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst deelt de betrokkene onverwijld, en in ieder geval niet later dan twee weken na de betekening van de beslissing van de rechter in arbeidszaken, mede of zij verkiest het dienstverband voort te zetten of een schadeloosstelling te betalen, Indien deze mededeling niet binnen deze termijn wordt gedaan, wordt de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst geacht de betaling van de schadeloosstelling te hebben verkozen. De keuze om het dienstverband voort te zetten, sluit de mogelijkheid niet uit om tegen de beslissing in beroep te gaan. Dit lid is niet van toepassing op leden van ondernemingsraden (Betriebsvertretungen).   
3.  De Duitse wetgeving betreffende de sociale verzekering, met inbegrip van ongevallenverzekering, werkloosheidsverzekering en kindertoelage, is van toepassing op werknemers in dienst van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst. De Bondsrepubliek is de verzekeraar voor wat de ongevallenverzekering betreft.   
4.  Duitse burgerwerknemers in dienst van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst worden alleen toegelaten in functies van niet-militaire aard, met inbegrip van burgerbewakingsdiensten.   
5.  De Duitse autoriteiten stellen in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst vast: 

a) de arbeidsvoorwaarden, met inbegrip van lonen, salarissen en indeling in beroepsgroepen, die dienen als grondslag voor afzonderlijke arbeidsovereenkomsten, en sluiten tariefovereenkomsten af;  

b) de wijze van uitbetaling.     
6.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst hebben, met betrekking tot de werknemers, het recht van indienstneming, classificatie in overeenstemming met het zevende lid onder *a*), de tweede tot en met zesde volzin, en het bepaalde onder *b*), en van plaatsing, opleiding, overplaatsing, ontslag en aanvaarding van dienstopzeggingen.   
7.  

a) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst stellen het aantal en de aard van de benodigde arbeidsplaatsen vast en delen die arbeidsplaatsen in overeenkomstig de krachtens het vijfde lid onder *a*) vastgestelde beroepsgroepen. De personen die zulke betrekkingen zullen vervullen, worden door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst voorlopig ingedeeld in de passende loon- of salarisgroepen. De laatstgenoemde classificatie is onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten. Een dergelijke goedkeuring zal geacht worden te zijn gegeven, tenzij de Duitse autoriteiten binnen twee weken na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving van de voorlopige classificatie bezwaar maken. Indien een bezwaar is gemaakt wordt de passende classificatie vastgesteld in overleg tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst en de Duitse autoriteiten. De beloning over de tijd gedurende welke de voorlopige classificatie gold, wordt betaald overeenkomstig de uiteindelijke classificatie; de werknemer moet op het moment van de voorlopige classificatie in deze zin worden ingelicht.  

b) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht verrichten de classificatie van de leden van de burgerlijke dienstorganisaties. Zij stellen de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten van die classificatie op de hoogte en houden rekening met alle door laatstgenoemden gedane wijzigingsvoorstellen.     
8.  Geschillen voortvloeiend uit de arbeidsovereenkomst of uit sociale verzekering zijn onderworpen aan de Duitse rechtspraak. Acties tegen de werkgever worden ingesteld tegen de Bondsrepubliek. Acties namens de werkgever worden ingesteld door de Bondsrepubliek.   
9.  De Duitse wetgeving betreffende personeelsvertegenwoordiging zoals deze geldt voor de burgerwerknemers van de Duitse krijgsmacht zijn van toepassing op de werknemersvertegenwoordiging van burgerwerknemers bij een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, tenzij anders is bepaald in het op dit artikel betrekking hebbende onderdeel van het Protocol van Ondertekening.   
10.  Indien de Duitse autoriteiten administratief werk verrichten in verband met het in dienst nemen van arbeidskrachten door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst en in verband met hun beloning, worden de kosten van dit administratieve werk vergoed door de krijgsmacht ten bedrage van een percentage van het totaal aan lonen en salarissen, met inbegrip van toelagen en gratificaties, dat door bemiddeling van de Duitse autoriteiten wordt betaald. Het percentage wordt gebaseerd op de werkelijke kosten en zal onderwerp zijn van afzonderlijke overeenkomsten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van elke staat van herkomst waarin tevens de maatstaven voor de raming van dergelijke kosten zullen worden vastgelegd.   

### Artikel  57  

1.  Een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden zijn gerechtigd per voertuig, vaartuig en luchtvaartuig de grenzen van de Bondsrepubliek te overschrijden en zich binnen of boven het Bondsgebied te verplaatsen.   
2.  De exploitatierechten van de Duitse spoorwegen blijven onaangetast. Het gebruik van eigen goederenwagens en personenrijtuigen van een krijgsmacht, alsmede de toelating van eigen locomotieven van de krijgsmacht, wordt beheerst door contracten inzake gebruik of administratieve overeenkomsten gesloten tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse spoorwegautoriteiten.   
3.  Tenzij in deze Overeenkomst anders is bepaald, zijn de Duitse verkeersvoorschriften van toepassing op een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden.   
4.  

a) Een krijgsmacht mag slechts in geval van militaire noodzaak afwijken van de Duitse wegenverkeersvoorschriften en dan nog slechts met inachtneming van de openbare orde en veiligheid.  

b) Tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten worden overeenkomsten gesloten over de aanwijzing en het gebruik van een wegennet voor militair verkeer met motorvoertuigen en aanhangwagens, waarvan de afmetingen, de asdruk, het totaalgewicht of -aantal de door de Duitse wegenverkeersvoorschriften gestelde beperkingen overschrijden. Het verkeer met zodanige voertuigen en aanhangwagens op wegen, niet gelegen binnen het overeengekomen wegennet, is slechts toegestaan in geval van ongevallen, rampen, noodtoestand (Staatsnotstand) of krachtens overeenkomst tussen de genoemde autoriteiten.     
5.  Onder het voorbehoud dat rekening wordt gehouden met de openbare orde en veiligheid, zijn op de constructie, de uitvoering en de uitrusting van voertuigen, aanhangwagens, binnenvaartuigen en luchtvaartuigen van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst de Duitse voorschriften niet van toepassing, indien die voertuigen, aanhangwagens, binnenvaartuigen en luchtvaartuigen voldoen aan de voorschriften van de staat van herkomst.   
6.  Een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst mogen burgerluchtvaartterreinen en andere landingsterreinen, die hun niet voor uitsluitend gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld, voor het landen met militaire luchtvaartuigen slechts gebruiken in noodgevallen of in overeenstemming met administratieve of andere overeenkomsten, gesloten met de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten.   
7.  De Duitse militaire autoriteiten behartigen de militaire luchtvaartbelangen van de krijgsmachten in de Duitse Commissie voor de coördinatie van de burger- en de militaire luchtvaart, zodra deze Commissie ingevolge de aanbevelingen van de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie en van de Commissie voor de Coördinatie van het gebruik van het Europese luchtruim van de NAVO is ingesteld; de Duitse militaire autoriteiten zijn er voor verantwoordelijk dat in deze Commissie een gecoördineerd militair standpunt naar voren wordt gebracht. Aan vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmachten wordt, indien dit raadzaam is, voldoende gelegenheid gegeven hun standpunt voor de Commissie uiteen te zetten.   
8.  Het geheel van de door de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmachten ontwikkelde en toegepaste luchtverkeerscontrole en de daarbij behorende verbindingsmedia worden gecoördineerd voor zover dit vereist is ter verzekering van de luchtverkeersveiligheid en de gemeenschappelijke verdediging.   

### Artikel  58  

1.  Een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden zijn gerechtigd gebruik te maken van Duitse openbare en particuliere vervoermiddelen en vervoersdiensten, die voor het openbare vervoer in de Bondsrepubliek bestemd zijn. Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, is de uitoefening van dit recht onderworpen aan de algemeen voor het verkeer geldende voorschriften.   
2.  

a) De tarieven die voor een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst gelden voor het gebruik van de in het eerste lid bedoelde vervoermiddelen en vervoersdiensten, zijn niet minder gunstig dan die welke gelden voor de Duitse strijdkrachten. Deze tarieven worden door de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten in overeenstemming met de Duitse verkeerswetgeving vastgesteld of goedgekeurd. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht hebben het recht deel te nemen aan de onderhandelingen met de vervoerders inzake de militaire tarieven. Indien zich met betrekking tot vervoersdiensten ten behoeve van een krijgsmacht en haar civiele dienst bijzondere omstandigheden voordoen, waarin de militaire tarieven niet voorzien, herzien de Duitse autoriteiten, na onderhandelingen tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de vervoerders, de militaire tarieven binnen de grenzen van hun wettelijke bevoegdheden op redelijke wijze.  

b) De militaire tarieven worden berekend op basis van een vereenvoudigd schema dat rekening houdt met de specifieke aard van het militaire vervoer en dat de praktische toepassing van de tarieven door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst vergemakkelijkt.  

c) De toepassing van de militaire tariefschalen dient in het geheel genomen voor een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst niet tot een minder gunstige uitkomst te leiden, dan de toepassing van de openbare tariefschalen, met inbegrip van in aanmerking komende bijzondere tarieven.     
3.  De Bondsrepubliek neemt verzoeken van een krijgsmacht om oprichting van aanvullende installaties en inrichtingen of verandering in bestaande installaties en inrichtingen in welwillende overweging, indien niet op andere wijze in de behoeften van de krijgsmacht aan vervoer kan worden voorzien.   
4.  De Duitse autoriteiten nemen binnen het kader van hun bevoegdheden zo nodig gepaste maatregelen om te verzekeren, dat in de behoeften van een krijgsmacht aan ketelwagens en aan slaap- en restauratierijtuigen op redelijke voorwaarden wordt voorzien door contractuele regelingen tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de ondernemingen die zulke diensten op commerciële basis ter beschikking van andere gebruikers stellen.   

### Artikel  59  

1.  

a) Een krijgsmacht kan veldpostkantoren voor het post- en telegraaf verkeer van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden, instellen en doen functioneren.  

b) De veldpostkantoren kunnen met name open of gesloten postzendingen van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden 

i) in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek invoeren;  

ii) verzenden naar bestemmingen buiten het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek en naar andere veldpostkantoren binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek;  

iii) binnen het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek vervoeren.    

c) De postwisseldienst is beperkt tot het verkeer tussen de veldpostkantoren onderling en tussen deze postkantoren en andere postkantoren van de betrokken staat van herkomst.     
2.  De veldpostkantoren kunnen open of gesloten postzendingen van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden aan de Duitse Bondsposterijen verzenden of van die posterijen ontvangen. Internationale overeenkomsten die van kracht zijn tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de betrokken staat van herkomst, zijn van toepassing op het postverkeer tussen de veldpostkantoren en de Duitse Bondsposterijen, tenzij tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht bijzondere overeenkomsten worden gesloten inzake de posttarieven of bijzondere diensten. Wisselkantoren worden opgericht met wederzijds goedvinden.   
3.  Postzendingen, die bij veldpostkantoren ter post worden bezorgd, kunnen met postzegels van de betrokken staat van herkomst worden gefrankeerd.   
4.  Indien een onderdeel van een krijgsmacht geen eigen veldpostkantoor heeft, kunnen dat onderdeel, zijn civiele dienst en de leden en gezinsleden hiervan gebruik maken van de veldpostdienst van een andere krijgsmacht. Indien een zodanig gebruik van blijvende aard of langere duur moet zijn, worden de Duitse Bondsposterijen daaromtrent zo spoedig mogelijk ingelicht.   

### Artikel  60  

1.  Voorzover dit artikel niet anders bepaalt, maken een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden gebruik van de openbare verreberichtgevingsdiensten van de Bondsrepubliek. Op dit gebruik zijn de geldende Duitse voorschriften van toepassing, voorzover bij administratieve overeenkomsten niet anders is overeengekomen. Bij de toepassing van deze voorschriften wordt een krijgsmacht geen minder gunstige behandeling toegekend dan de Duitse strijdkrachten genieten.   
2.  Voorzover zulks voor militaire doeleinden vereist is, kan een krijgsmacht: 

a) lijnverbindingen en de daartoe bestemde apparatuur binnen de bij haar in gebruik zijnde onroerende goederen,  

b) na raadpleging van de betrokken Duitse autoriteiten, radiostations voor vaste diensten,  

c) installaties ten behoeve van mobiele radio-installaties en peilinstallaties,  

d) andere radio-ontvangstinrichtingen,  

e) tijdelijke inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving van allerlei aard voor oefeningsdoeleinden, manoeuvres en noodgevallen, aanleggen, in werking brengen en houden en instandhouden.     
3.  

a) Een krijgsmacht kan met toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten buiten de onroerende goederen welke zij gebruikt, lijnverbindingen en de daartoe bestemde apparatuur installeren, in werking brengen en houden en instandhouden indien 

i) daarvoor dwingende redenen van militaire veiligheid bestaan, of  

ii) de Duitse autoriteiten ofwel niet in staat zijn tot, ofwel afzien van, de beschikbaarstelling van de gevraagde inrichtingen.    

b) Bij administratieve overeenkomsten wordt een procedure vastgesteld, die het mogelijk maakt de toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten snel te verkrijgen.     
4.  

a) Een krijgsmacht kan het gebruik en de instandhouding van inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving die ingevolge de vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst geldende voorschriften in gebruik genomen zijn, bestendigen.  

b) Inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving welker installatie vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst krachtens toen geldende regelingen werd begonnen doch niet werd voltooid, kunnen binnen een tijdvak van zes maanden na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst in gebruik worden genomen, indien zij op een lijst voorkomen welke bij de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst aan de Bondsregering overhandigd wordt.     
5.  

a) Een krijgsmacht is gerechtigd zijn eigen radio- en televisiezendinstallaties in bedrijf te hebben ten behoeve van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden, met dien verstande dat de uitzendingen van deze militaire installaties de functionering van de Duitse omroep niet buitenmate hindert. Bestaande installaties van deze soort kunnen in werking blijven indien aan deze voorwaarde wordt voldaan. Nieuwe zendinstallaties mogen slechts worden ingericht en in bedrijf gehouden met toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten.  

b) Een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden kunnen radio- en televisie-ontvangtoestellen vrij van rechten en zonder persoonlijke vergunningen installeren en in bedrijf hebben.     
6.  De bepalingen van het vijfde lid van de bij dit artikel behorende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening zijn van toepassing op radiofrequenties en hun specifieke kenmerkende gegevens.   
7.  Inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving, ingericht door een krijgsmacht, kunnen worden aangesloten op het openbare net van de Bondsrepubliek indien zulks technisch en uit oogpunt van bedrijfsvoering mogelijk is. De plaatsen van aansluiting op het openbare net van de Bondsrepubliek worden in gemeenschappelijk overleg bepaald.   
8.  

a) Bij de installatie en het in bedrijf hebben van inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving neemt een krijgsmacht de bepalingen van het Internationale Verdrag betreffende de verreberichtgeving van Buenos Aires van 1952, of een daarvoor eventueel in de plaats tredende overeenkomst, in acht, alsmede de overige internationale overeenkomsten welke de Bondsrepubliek op het gebied van de verreberichtgeving binden.  

b) Een krijgsmacht is evenwel gebonden aan de onder *a* genoemde bepalingen voorzover de Duitse strijdkrachten daarvan op grond van voorschriften van de Bondsrepubliek zijn vrijgesteld.  

c) Bij het in de toekomst aangaan van internationale overeenkomsten op het gebied van de verreberichtgeving, houden de Duitse autoriteiten, na overleg met een krijgsmacht, voldoende rekening met de behoefte van die krijgsmacht op het gebied van de verreberichtgeving.     
9.  

a) Een krijgsmacht neemt alle maatregelen welke redelijkerwijs van haar verwacht kunnen worden om storingen van de Duitse verreberichtgevingsdiensten door inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving of andere elektrische installaties van de krijgsmacht te voorkomen of op te heffen.  

b) De Duitse autoriteiten nemen, binnen het kader van de Duitse voorschriften, al die maatregelen welke redelijkerwijs van hen verwacht kunnen worden om storing van de verreberichtgevingsdiensten van een krijgsmacht door Duitse inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving of andere elektrische installaties te voorkomen of op te heffen.     
10.  De autoriteiten van de betrokken staat van herkomst oefenen volledige controle uit over de in het Bondsgebied liggende kabels, gecodeerd als FK 12 en FK 41, met inbegrip van de daarbij behorende uitrusting.   

### Artikel  61  

1.  Onverminderd de vrijstellingen op het gebied van belastingen en in- en uitvoerrechten, voorzien in het NAVO-Status Verdrag, in deze Overeenkomst of in enige andere toepasselijke overeenkomst, dienen de prijzen voor de leverantiën en diensten aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst overeen te stemmen met het in het Bondsgebied geldende prijsniveau. Deze prijzen mogen de voor leverantiën en diensten aan Duitse autoriteiten toelaatbare prijzen niet te boven gaan. Indien goederen gesubsidieerd zijn in het belang van de individuele Duitse verbruiker, kan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst geen aanspraak maken op dergelijke subsidies, tenzij die goederen bestemd zijn voor gebruik of verbruik door personen behorende tot de groep burgerwerknemers in de zin van artikel 56.   
2.  Op de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst met betrekking tot arbeidslonen en tarieven voor vervoer en voor verreberichtgeving wordt geen inbreuk gemaakt door de bepalingen van het eerste lid.   

### Artikel  62  

1.  Wanneer ten behoeve van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst vorderingsmaatregelen (Anforderungsverfahren) volgens de Duitse vorderingswetgeving worden genomen, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a) De maatregelen worden genomen door de Duitse autoriteiten, die in overleg met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst worden aangewezen.  

b) De bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten belasten zich, in overeenstemming met administratieve overeenkomsten, met de uitoefening van rechten en de vervulling van verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit de positie van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst als ontvanger van het gevorderde (Leistungsempfänger). De krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst vervult echter zelf die verplichtingen die naar hun aard niet door de Duitse autoriteiten kunnen worden vervuld. De Duitse autoriteiten die de belangen van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst behartigen inzake het bedrag der uit te betalen schadeloosstelling aanvaarden voorstellen van degene van wie wordt gevorderd (Leistungspflichtiger) of van de met de vaststelling van de schadeloosstelling belaste autoriteiten slechts in overleg met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst. De Duitse autoriteiten dienen zelf geen voorstellen in met betrekking tot de regeling van het bedrag der schadeloosstelling dan nadat een zodanig overleg heeft plaats gehad. De bepalingen van artikel 63 van deze Overeenkomst blijven onverlet.  

c) Rechtsgedingen ten behoeve van of tegen de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst, voortvloeiend uit hun positie als ontvanger van het gevorderde, worden door en in naam van de Bondsrepubliek ingesteld of verdedigd.     
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing met betrekking tot de Wet beperking grondeigendom en de Wet inzake de verwerving van terreinen.   

### Artikel  63  

1.  In de gevallen en in de mate waarin zulks in het tweede tot en met zevende lid is bepaald, worden geen betalingen gedaan voor goederen en diensten waarvan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst gebruik maakt voor haar eigen doeleinden of welke hun voor deze doeleinden ter beschikking zijn gesteld.   
2.  Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst kan kosteloos gebruik maken van openbare wegen, hoofdverkeerswegen en bruggen.   
3.  Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst geniet kosteloos de diensten en bijstand van openbare diensten, met inbegrip van de diensten van de Duitse politie, de openbare gezondheidsdienst en de brandweer, alsmede van de meteorologische, topografische en cartografische diensten, in tenminste dezelfde mate als de Duitse strijdkrachten. Hetzelfde geldt voor het gebruik van bevaarbare wateren.   
4.  

a) Voorzover geen andere regelingen zijn of zullen worden getroffen, kan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst kosteloos gebruik maken van vermogensbestanddelen die rechtens eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes stehend) of van goederen welke zijn of zullen worden aangeschaft of vervaardigd ten laste van de bezettingskosten en van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek of van fondsen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing op het gebruik van goederen die in eigendom toebehoren aan of in beheer zijn bij de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen of Bondsposterijen.  

b) Voorzover geen andere regelingen zijn of zullen worden getroffen, verzekert de Bondsrepubliek dat de staat van herkomst aan wie goederen die rechtens eigendom zijn van een Land voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn of zullen worden gesteld, gevrijwaard wordt tegen alle aanspraken op schadeloosstelling welke dat Land volgens de Duitse wetgeving eventueel geldend kan maken.  

c) Voorzover geen andere regelingen zijn of zullen worden getroffen, wordt de vergoeding voor het gebruik van vermogensbestanddelen die niet begrepen zijn onder a, eerste volzin, of onder *b* van dit lid, en die ten laste van de geldmiddelen van de Bondsrepubliek of ten laste van de eigen geldmiddelen van de staat van herkomst zijn of zullen worden herbouwd, verminderd in dezelfde mate als waarin de kosten van de herbouw zich verhouden tot de totale waarde van deze goederen.  

d) De vrijstelling van vergoeding voor het gebruik van goederen als bedoeld onder *a* tot en met *c* van dit lid strekt zich echter niet uit tot: 

i) reparatie- en onderhoudskosten;  

ii) lopende openbare lasten welke op een terrein (Grundstück) rusten, voorzover naar Duits recht de Bondsrepubliek tot betaling of vergoeding daarvan verplicht is;  

iii) andere bedrijfskosten.       
5.  

a) De volgende uitgavenposten die voortvloeien uit het feit dat op verzoek van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst op grond van de Duitse wetgeving goederen worden aangeschaft of diensten worden verricht, of rechten worden beperkt, overgedragen of ingetrokken, worden niet gedragen door de staat van herkomst: 

i) schadeloosstelling verschuldigd ingevolge de Wet inzake de verwerving van terreinen met uitzondering van: 

aa) schadeloosstelling voor voorlopige inbezitneming (Besitzeinweisungsentschädigung) voorzover het niet betreft handelingen tot verkrijging van terreinen (Landbeschaffungsvorhaben) die worden aangevangen na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst;  

bb) vergoedingen voor het gebruik van onroerende goederen die aan een krijgsmacht of aan een civiele dienst beschikbaar zijn gesteld en die niet rechtens eigendom zijn van de Bondsrepubliek of een der „Länder” voorzover het niet betreft onroerende goederen die na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst aan een krijgsmacht of aan een civiele dienst voor de oprichting van permanente bouwwerken ter beschikking zijn gesteld;    

ii) schadeloosstelling die krachtens de Duitse wetgeving aan de „Länder” betaald moet worden terzake van opgelegde ten aanzien van grondeigendommen (Schutzbereichentschädigung) voorzover het door de instelling van beperkingen veroorzaakte vermogensnadeel uitsluitend voortvloeit uit de beperking van het economische of een ander gebruik van de goederen.    

b) Indien de verwerving van gronden voor een krijgsmacht of voor een civiele dienst andere kosten voor de Bondsrepubliek met zich mede brengt, vinden tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht, voor elk geval afzonderlijk, onderhandelingen plaats waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met alle van belang zijnde factoren en onder voorbehoud van het gestelde in het zesde lid onder *c* teneinde vast te stellen of en zo ja in hoeverre, de staat van herkomst, te wiens behoeve de gronden moeten worden verworven, deze kosten moet dragen; te dier zake worden overeenkomsten gesloten.  

c) Indien - in het geval waarin op verzoek van een krijgsmacht beperkingen ten aanzien van het grondeigendom zijn ingesteld - de schadeloosstelling voor de opgelegde beperkingen moet worden voldaan op een andere wijze dan door middel van periodieke betalingen, kunnen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht voor elk daarvoor in aanmerking komend afzonderlijk geval onderhandelen over een verdeling van de schadeloosstelling, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met alle van belang zijnde factoren, met inbegrip van de duur van het gebruik door de krijgsmacht van het onroerend goed ten aanzien waarvan de beperkingen zijn ingesteld.     
6.  

a) Van de uitgaven voortvloeiende uit de oprichting door een krijgsmacht of door een civiele dienst van bouwwerken van allerlei aard of uitgaven in verband daarmede, is de staat van herkomst niet aansprakelijk voor de uitgaven veroorzaakt door de ontruiming van terreinen (Räumung).  

b) Indien inrichtingen en middelen ten dienste van vervoer en verreberichtgeving, de water-, gas- en elektriciteitsvoorziening en de afvoer van afvalwater ingesteld, gewijzigd, versterkt of uitgebreid zijn op verzoek van de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, mede dienen ter voorziening in Duitse behoeften, worden de kosten van die inrichtingen en middelen - met inbegrip van de kosten van herstel en onderhoud - verdeeld op een wijze die overeenstemt met het aandeel van de Duitse belangen in vergelijking tot de belangen van de staat van herkomst. De bedragen worden in elk afzonderlijk geval in overleg tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht vastgesteld. Deze regeling is eveneens van toepassing op de kosten van onderhoud en herstel van soortgelijke inrichtingen en middelen waaromtrent van Duitse zijde plannen bestaan ze buiten dienst te stellen of af te breken doch die op verzoek van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst in stand moeten worden gehouden.  

c) Indien tengevolge van de verwerving van gronden ten behoeve van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, of als gevolg van bouwwerkzaamheden welke door of ten behoeve van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst worden uitgevoerd, inrichtingen en middelen ten dienste van vervoer en verreberichtgeving, de water-, gas- en elektriciteitsvoorziening, of de afvoer van afvalwater, omgelegd of verplaatst moeten worden - hetzij omdat ze niet langer voor openbaar gebruik beschikbaar zijn, hetzij omdat kan worden aangetoond dat verder gebruik niet uitvoerbaar is - draagt de staat van herkomst de kosten die daaruit voortvloeien slechts voorzover de tot dat tijdstip geldende norm niet overschreden wordt.     
7.  

a) Indien militaire of andere bij een krijgsmacht in gebruik zijnde luchtvaartuigen blijvend gestationeerd zijn op burgerluchtvaartterreinen - met inbegrip van burgervliegvelden die niet voor uitsluitend gebruik aan de krijgsmacht ter beschikking zijn gesteld - kunnen voor de gemeenschappelijk gebruikte inrichtingen en middelen vergoedingen worden overeengekomen, die afwijken van de tarieven die volgens de Duitse voorschriften gelden. Deze vergoedingen kunnen na overleg worden voldaan door middel van het leveren van diensten of door leveringen in natura.  

b) Voor noodlandingen door militaire of andere bij de krijgsmacht in gebruik zijnde luchtvaartuigen zijn geen vergoedingen verschuldigd.     

### Artikel  64  

De leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of gezinsleden kunnen zelfstandig kosteloos gebruik maken van dienstverlenende instanties, met inbegrip van de diensten van de Duitse politie, openbare gezondheidszorg en brandweer, alsmede van meteorologische, topografische en cartografische diensten en andere openbare diensten en van openbare inrichtingen, in dezelfde mate als andere personen op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek van deze inrichtingen en diensten kosteloos gebruik kunnen maken. Hetzelfde geldt voor het gebruik van openbare wegen, hoofdstraatwegen, bruggen en bevaarbare wateren.  

### Artikel  65  

1.  

a) De vrijstelling van invoerrechten, bedoeld in artikel XI, vierde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, wordt niet slechts verleend voor goederen die op het tijdstip van hun invoer eigendom zijn van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst doch ook voor goederen die aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst worden geleverd uit hoofde van contracten die de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst rechtstreeks met niet in de Bondsrepubliek of Berlijn (West) gevestigde personen gesloten heeft. Deze vrijstelling is van toepassing, onverschillig of de goederen worden vervoerd met vervoermiddelen van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst dan wel door transportondernemingen.  

b) Invoerrechten en accijnzen, met inbegrip van de omzetbelasting bij invoer (Umsatzausgleichsteuer), worden niet geheven van ingevoerde goederen die zich in douane-entrepots (Zollausschlüssen) of onder douanetoezicht (Zollverkehr) bevinden, en aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst geleverd worden uit hoofde van contracten die een officiële aanschaffingsdienst van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst heeft gesloten met personen die in de Bondsrepubliek of in Berlijn (West) gevestigd zijn, mits de betaling daarvoor geschiedt in de valuta van de staat van herkomst. Aan deze voorwaarde wordt ook geacht te zijn voldaan, indien de betaling geschiedt in Duitse marken die de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst heeft verkregen door inwisseling van bedoelde valuta in de Bondsrepubliek bij in onderling overleg aangewezen instellingen, dan wel in Duitse marken die krachtens bijzondere overeenkomst tussen de betrokken regeringen voor dit doel mogen worden gebruikt.     
2.  De vrijstellingen bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn ook van toepassing ten aanzien van goederen die door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst zijn ingevoerd of aangebracht om ze aan hun leden of gezinsleden voor particulier gebruik of verbruik te vervreemden. Tenzij in bepaalde gevallen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten anders overeengekomen zijn, mag de vervreemding slechts geschieden door tussenkomst van bepaalde organen van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst of van te hunnen dienste staande organisaties, waarvan de namen aan de Bondsregering medegedeeld worden.   
3.  Een krijgsmacht en een civiele dienst zijn gerechtigd goederen in het Bondsgebied te vervreemden aan personen die geen lid van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst of geen gezinslid zijn, in overeenstemming met nadere met de Duitse autoriteiten te sluiten overeenkomsten. De verwerver van die goederen is verantwoordelijk voor de naleving van de krachtens de Duitse douanewetgeving uit de vervreemding voortvloeiende verplichtingen. De krijgsmacht en de civiele dienst staan de afvoer van de goederen eerst toe, indien de belanghebbende een verklaring van de betrokken Duitse douaneautoriteit overlegt ten bewijze dat hij de nodige regelingen heeft getroffen met de Duitse dienst der douane.   
4.  Een krijgsmacht en de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten treffen alle in aanmerking komende maatregelen ter verzekering van een onbelemmerde en snelle behandeling van in- en uitvoerzendingen van de krijgsmacht en de civiele dienst door de Duitse douane-autoriteiten.   
5.  De douanecontrole van door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in- of uitgevoerde zendingen wordt door de Duitse autoriteiten uitgevoerd met inachtneming van de volgende beginselen: 

a) Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel XI, derde lid, van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en het in dit lid onder *b*, *c* en *d* bepaalde kunnen zendingen van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst door de Duitse douane-autoriteiten worden onderzocht op aantal, soort, merken en gewicht van de afzonderlijke colli.  

b) 

i) De Duitse douane-autoriteiten kunnen de zendingen ook op hun inhoud onderzoeken. Een zodanig onderzoek zal, indien het colli betreft, die met een officieel zegel van een krijgsmacht of van de militaire autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst zijn verzegeld, slechts plaatsvinden in geval van ernstige verdenking. Indien het gaat om andere zendingen, kan het onderzoek ook steekproefsgewijze worden uitgevoerd. De laadruimte van voertuigen die op de wijze bedoeld in de tweede volzin verzegeld zijn, en gesloten colli worden slechts aan een zodanig onderzoek onderworpen in het bijzijn van daartoe aangewezen vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, tenzij de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst er in een bepaald geval van afziet zich daarbij te laten vertegenwoordigen.  

ii) De omvang van de onderzoeken en de wijze waarop de onderzoeken zullen worden uitgevoerd worden bij bijzondere overeenkomst tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse douaneautoriteiten geregeld. Deze overeenkomsten houden rekening met de verschillende soorten zendingen, de wijze van vervoer, de eigen werkwijze van iedere krijgsmacht en alle andere van belang zijnde factoren. Een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst kan verzoeken dat het onderzoek niet plaatsvindt aan de grens maar op de plaats van bestemming der zendingen of in de nabijheid daarvan. In die gevallen zijn de Duitse douane-autoriteiten gerechtigd de nodige maatregelen te treffen om te verzekeren dat de zending ongeschonden de plaats van onderzoek bereikt.    

c) Indien de Duitse douane-autoriteiten dit verzoeken, worden zendingen die - blijkens door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht afgegeven officiële verklaringen - militaire uitrustingsstukken bevatten waarop bijzondere veiligheidsbepalingen van toepassing zijn, onderworpen aan een onderzoek, dat slechts wordt uitgevoerd door speciaal voor dit doel aangewezen vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmacht. Het resultaat van het onderzoek wordt aan de bevoegde Duitse autoriteit medegedeeld.  

d) De bepalingen van dit lid onder *a*, *b* en *c* zijn in beginsel mede van toepassing op zendingen van een krijgsmacht die via militaire luchtvaartterreinen worden in- of uitgevoerd.   De Duitse autoriteiten nemen echter genoegen met van tijd tot tijd uit te voeren controles die plaatsvinden in overleg met de voor het betreffende luchtvaartterrein verantwoordelijke autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht oefenen een regelmatige controle op al deze zendingen uit. Douanecontrole in militaire vliegtuigen waarop bijzondere veiligheidsbepalingen van toepassing zijn, wordt slechts uitgevoerd door speciaal daartoe aangewezen vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmacht.   
6.  Bij de uitvoer van in het Bondsgebied door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst verworven goederen moet aan het douanekantoor een officiële verklaring worden overgelegd gelijk aan die bedoeld in artikel XI, vierde lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, behalve voorzover op de voet van het tiende lid van dat artikel van deze eis wordt afgezien.   

### Artikel  66  

1.  De leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en de gezinsleden kunnen, naast hun persoonlijke bagage en roerende goederen en hun particuliere motorvoertuigen, ook andere goederen bestemd voor hun persoonlijk of huishoudelijk gebruik of verbruik, vrij van rechten en andere invoerbelastingen invoeren. Dit voorrecht is niet alleen van toepassing op goederen die aan deze personen in eigendom toebehoren, doch ook op goederen die hun bij wijze van geschenk worden toegezonden of die aan hen worden geleverd uit hoofde van contracten die zij rechtstreeks met niet in de Bondsrepubliek of Berlijn (West) gevestigde personen hebben gesloten.   
2.  Voor bepaalde door de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten aangegeven goederen die in het bijzonder voorwerp zijn van overtreding van douanevoorschriften, geldt het in het eerste lid neergelegde voorrecht slechts, indien die goederen door leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of door gezinsleden persoonlijk worden ingevoerd in de door hen medegevoerde bagage, en slechts in hoeveelheden die door de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten in overeenstemming met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht zijn vastgesteld.   
3.  In twijfelgevallen zijn de Duitse douaneambtenaren gerechtigd overlegging van een schriftelijke verklaring te vorderen, waarin wordt verklaard dat de ingevoerde goederen bestemd zijn voor het persoonlijke of huishoudelijke gebruik of verbruik van de persoon die die goederen invoert. Dit is echter niet van toepassing ten aanzien van goederen waarvan de invoer in overeenstemming met het tweede lid is beperkt. Bedoelde verklaringen worden slechts afgegeven door een beperkt aantal beambten, die daartoe door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht speciaal zijn aangewezen en met wier namen en handtekeningen de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis gesteld zijn.   
4.  De leden van de krijgsmacht, van de civiele dienst en de gezinsleden mogen goederen die vrij van rechten zijn ingevoerd of met belastingvrijstelling zijn verworven onderling vervreemden. Overdracht aan andere personen is hun slechts na kennisgeving aan en goedkeuring van de Duitse autoriteiten toegestaan, voorzover deze autoriteiten geen uitzonderingen van algemene aard hebben toegelaten.   
5.  

a) De douanecontrole op goederen die via post- of vrachtdiensten van een krijgsmacht worden verzonden door of aan de leden van de krijgsmacht, van de civiele dienst of gezinsleden wordt door de Duitse douane-autoriteiten uitgeoefend op plaatsen aangewezen in overleg tussen die autoriteiten en de bevoegde autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht. Het douane-onderzoek vindt plaats in het bijzijn van vertegenwoordigers van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht.  

b) Indien het voor de toepassing van de in artikel 69 vervatte voorschriften inzake deviezencontrole noodzakelijk blijkt in de veldpostkantoren van een krijgsmacht brieven en postpakketten verzonden door of aan leden van de krijgsmacht, van de civiele dienst of gezinsleden, aan een onderzoek te onderwerpen, moet de afzender of de ontvanger, dan wel een gemachtigde van een hunner, aanwezig zijn wanneer die brieven of pakketten worden geopend. De omvang van deze onderzoeken en de wijze waarop zij worden uitgevoerd, worden in overleg tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten vastgesteld.     
6.  De leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of gezinsleden kunnen door hen in de Bondsrepubliek ingevoerde goederen vrij van uitvoerrechten (Ausgangsabgaben) weder uitvoeren. Zij kunnen voorts goederen die hun in eigendom toebehoren en die niet voor de handel bestemd zijn, vrij van economische uitvoerverboden of -beperkingen en van uitvoerrechten, in met hun economische omstandigheden overeenkomende hoeveelheden, uitvoeren. In twijfelgevallen zijn de Duitse douane-autoriteiten gerechtigd overlegging van een schriftelijke verklaring te vorderen, waarin wordt verklaard dat aan deze voorwaarden is voldaan. Deze verklaring wordt afgegeven in overeenstemming met de voorschriften van de laatste volzin van het derde lid.   
7.  Indien de douanecontrole van leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden plaatsvindt in een douanekantoor waarbij grensliaisonpersoneel van een krijgsmacht is geplaatst, schakelen de Duitse douanebeambten dit personeel in, indien overtredingen worden geconstateerd of moeilijkheden rijzen in verband met de controle.   

### Artikel  67  

1.  Een krijgsmacht is niet onderworpen aan belastingheffing met betrekking tot aangelegenheden die uitsluitend binnen het kader van haar werkzaamheden als zodanig vallen, noch met betrekking tot de voor die werkzaamheden bestemde goederen. Dit is evenwel niet van toepassing op belastingen die voortvloeien uit deelneming van de krijgsmacht aan het Duitse economische leven of betrekking hebben op hiervoor bestemde goederen. Leveranties en diensten van de krijgsmacht aan haar leden, aan leden van de civiele dienst en aan gezinsleden worden niet beschouwd als deelneming aan het Duitse economische leven.   
2.  De ontheffing van douanerechten en andere in- en uitvoerrechten op goederen die door een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst worden in- of uitgevoerd of door hen worden verworven uit douane-entrepots of inrichtingen die onder douanecontrole staan, wordt vastgesteld in overeenstemming met artikel XI van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en artikel 65 van dit Verdrag.   
3.  

a) 

i) Voor leveranties en andere diensten aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst uit hoofde van bestellingen, door een aanschaffingsdienst van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst gedaan, en bestemd voor het gebruik of verbruik door de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden of gezinsleden, worden de onder ii) tot en met iv) bedoelde belastingfaciliteiten verleend onder voorwaarde dat de betaling geschiedt in de valuta van de staat van herkomst. Deze voorwaarde wordt geacht te zijn vervuld, indien de betaling geschiedt in Duitse marken die de krijgsmacht of haar gemachtigde heeft verkregen door inwisseling in die valuta in de Bondsrepubliek, of in Duitse marken waarvan het gebruik in het kader van de bepalingen van dit lid is toegestaan op grond van bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst. Vrijstellingen en restituties van belastingen worden bij de berekening van prijzen in aanmerking genomen.  

ii) Leveranties en diensten aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst zijn vrijgesteld van omzetbelasting. Leveranciers ontvangen op hun verzoek de in de Duitse wet op de omzetbelasting voor het geval van uitvoer in uitzicht gestelde restituties. Leveranties aan een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst worden beschouwd als leveranties en gros.  

iii) Vervoersdiensten, ten behoeve van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst verricht door de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen of door commerciële transportondernemingen, zijn vrijgesteld van vervoersbelasting (Beförderungssteuer). Vrijstelling van vervoersbelasting wordt niet verleend voor vervoersdiensten die voor rekening van of door een leverancier of persoon die diensten verleent in verband met leveranties of diensten aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst worden uitgevoerd hetzij met middelen van transport van de leverancier over lange afstanden (Werkfernverkehr), hetzij door de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen of andere commerciële transportondernemingen.  

iv) Voor goederen die uit het niet aan douanetoezicht onderworpen verkeer (zollrechtlich freier Verkehr) geleverd worden aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst, worden de vrijstellingen, restituties of prijsverlagingen verleend, die in de douane-, accijns- en kartelbelastingwetgeving voor het geval van uitvoer in uitzicht zijn gesteld.    

b) Het onder *a* bepaalde is eveneens van toepassing, indien de Duitse autoriteiten aankopen verrichten of bouwwerkzaamheden uitvoeren voor een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst.  

c) De onder *a* en *b* bedoelde faciliteiten worden verleend, mits aan de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten het bewijs wordt geleverd dat aan de voorwaarden voor de verlening is voldaan. De wijze waarop dit bewijs wordt geleverd wordt in overeenkomsten tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst vastgelegd.     
4.  De bijzondere regelingen bedoeld in artikel XI, elfde lid, van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, voor brandstof en smeermiddelen, worden getroffen in overeenstemming met artikel 65, eerste lid onder *b*, en met het derde lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  68  

1.  Leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en gezinsleden verliezen geen belastingvoorrechten waarop zij ingevolge eventuele met de Bondsrepubliek gesloten internationale overeenkomsten recht hebben.   
2.  De verzekeringsbelasting (Versicherungssteuer) moet worden betaald in die gevallen dat de verzekeringspremie wordt betaald aan een op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek gevestigde verzekeraar of een aldaar gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger van een buitenlandse verzekeraar, maar niet indien de premie rechtstreeks aan een buitenlandse verzekeraar wordt betaald. Met betrekking tot de verzekering van eigen motorrijtuigen van leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden, wordt betaling van verzekeringsbelasting evenmin vereist indien in individuele gevallen de verzekeringspremie die rechtstreeks betaalbaar is aan de buitenlandse verzekeraar, bij uitzondering aan de gemachtigde binnenlandse vertegenwoordiger van een zodanige buitenlandse verzekeraar wordt betaald.   
3.  Het feit dat leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst en gezinsleden overeenkomstig artikel X, eerste lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag geen woonplaats binnen het Bondsgebied hebben, houdt niet in dat zij als buitenlandse kopers worden beschouwd in de zin van de wetgeving inzake de omzetbelasting.   
4.  Gezinsleden worden met betrekking tot de toepassing van artikel X van het NAVO-Status Verdrag op dezelfde wijze behandeld als leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst.   

### Artikel  69  

1.  De rechten van de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, van de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden om betaalmiddelen en cheques in valuta van de Bondsrepubliek overeenkomstig de voorschriften bedoeld in artikel XIV van het NAVO-Status Verdrag in te voeren, uit te voeren en te bezitten, worden niet aangetast door de bepalingen van het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel.   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst zijn gerechtigd in te voeren, uit te voeren en te bezitten betaalmiddelen en cheques in andere valuta dan die van de Bondsrepubliek en militaire betalingsbonnen in de valuta van een staat van herkomst.   
3.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst kunnen aan de leden van een krijgsmacht en de civiele dienst en aan gezinsleden verstrekken: 

a) betaalmiddelen en cheques in de valuta van 

i) de Bondsrepubliek,  

ii) de staat van herkomst,  

iii) iedere andere staat, voorzover zulks vereist is ten behoeve van goedgekeurde reizen, waaronder verlofreizen zijn begrepen;    

b) militaire betalingsbonnen in de valuta van een staat van herkomst;   onder voorbehoud echter dat een systeem volgens hetwelk de leden van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst of gezinsleden worden betaald in de valuta van de staat van herkomst, slechts wordt ingevoerd door de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht in samenwerking met de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek.   
4.  Uitsluitend voorzover zulks is toegestaan krachtens regelingen die door de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht worden uitgevaardigd en die aan de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek ter kennis zijn gebracht, hebben een lid van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst en zijn gezinsleden recht: 

a) tot invoer van betaalmiddelen en cheques in de valuta van de staat van herkomst en militaire betalingsbonnen in de valuta van een staat van herkomst;  

b) tot uitvoer van 

i) betaalmiddelen en cheques in andere valuta dan die van de Bondsrepubliek indien de desbetreffende leden of gezinsleden die betaalmiddelen of cheques, hetzij hebben ingevoerd, hetzij van de teiten van de krijgsmacht of hun gemachtigden hebben ontvangen;  

ii) cheques door een zodanig lid of gezinslid op een financiële instelling of -dienst in de staat van herkomst getrokken;  

iii) militaire betalingsbonnen in de valuta van een staat van herkomst.       
5.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht nemen in samenwerking met de autoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek passende maatregelen om elk misbruik van de rechten toegekend ingevolge het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel te voorkomen en om het systeem van buitenlandse deviezenregelingen van de Bondsrepubliek te beveiligen, voorzover dit systeem, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel, betrekking heeft op een krijgsmacht, een civiele dienst, hun leden en gezinsleden.   

### Artikel  70  

Aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst wordt, overeenkomstig te sluiten bijzondere overeenkomsten, een rente vergoed over tegoeden in Duitse marken die met valuta van de staat van herkomst zijn verworven en die op rekeningen bij de Duitse Bondsbank (Deutsche Bundesbank) als daggeld zijn gedeponeerd.  

### Artikel  71  

1.  De niet-Duitse niet-commerciële organisaties vermeld in het tweede lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening, worden beschouwd en behandeld als integrerende delen van de krijgsmacht.   
2.  

a) De niet-Duitse niet-commerciële organisaties vermeld in het derde lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening genieten de voorrechten en vrijstellingen die aan de krijgsmacht ingevolge het NAVO-Status Verdrag en dit Verdrag zijn toegekend, voorzover zulks noodzakelijk is voor de vervulling van de doeleinden, omschreven in het derde lid van die afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening. De voorrechten en vrijstellingen met betrekking tot de invoer, de leveranties en de diensten ten behoeve van deze organisaties worden echter slechts toegekend indien die invoer, leveranties en diensten worden verkregen door tussenkomst van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst, dan wel door tussenkomst van door deze autoriteiten aangewezen aanschaffingsdiensten.  

b) De organisaties bedoeld onder *a* van dit lid hebben niet de bevoegdheden die de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst ingevolge het NAVO-Status Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst genieten.     
3.  Voor wat betreft hun werkzaamheden als niet-commerciële organisaties, zijn de organisaties vermeld in het tweede en derde lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening niet onderworpen aan de Duitse voorschriften inzake handel en nijverheid (Handel und Gewerbe), voorzover deze voorschriften anders op hen van toepassing zouden zijn. Van deze voorschriften zijn die welke betrekking hebben op veiligheidsmaatregelen niettemin van toepassing onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in artikel 53.   
4.  Aan andere niet-Duitse niet-commerciële organisaties kan, in bijzondere gevallen, bij administratieve overeenkomsten dezelfde behandeling worden toegekend als aan de organisaties vermeld in het tweede of derde lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening, indien zij: 

a) noodzakelijk zijn om aan de militaire behoeften van een krijgsmacht te voldoen, en  

b) handelen naar richtlijnen en onder toezicht van de krijgsmacht.     
5.  

a) Onder voorbehoud van het gestelde in het zesde lid worden de werknemers die uitsluitend in dienst zijn van de organisaties vermeld in het tweede of derde lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening beschouwd en behandeld als leden van een civiele dienst. Zij worden vrijgesteld van belastingheffing in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek over salarissen en emolumenten die aan hen door de organisaties worden betaald, indien deze salarissen en emolumenten: 

i) onderworpen zijn aan belastingheffing in de staat van herkomst of  

ii) berekend zijn op basis van de veronderstelling dat geen verplichting tot belastingbetaling zal ontstaan.    

b) Het onder *a* gestelde is eveneens van toepassing op werknemers van organisaties aan welke overeenkomstig het gestelde in het vierde lid, een zelfde behandeling is toegekend als aan de organisaties vermeld in het tweede of derde lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening.     
6.  Het vijfde lid is niet van toepassing op: 

a) statenloze personen,  

b) onderdanen van een staat die geen Partij is bij het Noordatlantische Verdrag;  

c) Duitsers,  

d) personen die hun gewone verblijfplaats in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek hebben.     

### Artikel  72  

1.  De niet-Duitse commerciële ondernemingen vermeld in het eerste lid van de op dit artikel betrekking hebbende afdeling van het Protocol van Ondertekening genieten: 

a) de vrijstellingen die aan een krijgsmacht ingevolge het NAVO-Status Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst zijn toegekend inzake douanerechten, belastingen, in- en heruitvoerbeperkingen en douanecontrole voorzover zulks noodzakelijk is voor de vervulling van hun doeleinden;  

b) vrijstelling van de Duitse voorschriften inzake handel en nijverheid (Handel und Gewerbe);  

c) die voorrechten die eventueel bij administratieve overeenkomsten worden vastgesteld.     
2.  Het eerste lid is alleen van toepassing indien 

a) de onderneming uitsluitend ten dienste staat van de krijgsmacht, de civiele dienst, hun leden of gezinsleden; en  

b) de werkzaamheden van de onderneming zijn beperkt tot commerciële transacties die niet door Duitse ondernemingen kunnen worden verricht zonder dat aan de militaire behoeften van de krijgsmacht afbreuk wordt gedaan.     
3.  Indien de werkzaamheden van een onderneming transacties omvatten die niet in overeenstemming zijn met de voorwaarden vastgesteld in het tweede lid, worden de vrijstellingen en voorrechten bedoeld in het eerste lid toegekend onder voorwaarde dat een duidelijk juridisch of administratief onderscheid wordt gemaakt tussen de werkzaamheden die uitsluitend worden verricht ten behoeve van de krijgsmacht en die waarmede dat niet het geval is.   
4.  In overeenstemming met de Duitse autoriteiten en onder de voorwaarden omschreven in het tweede en derde lid kunnen aan andere niet-Duitse commerciële ondernemingen alle of enkele vrijstellingen en voorrechten bedoeld in het eerste lid worden toegekend.   
5.  

a) Werknemers van ondernemingen aan wie ingevolge dit artikel vrijstellingen en voorrechten zijn toegekend, genieten, indien zij uitsluitend in dienst zijn bij zulke ondernemingen, dezelfde vrijstellingen en voorrechten als die welke zijn toegekend aan leden van een civiele dienst, tenzij zulke vrijstellingen en voorrechten door de staat van herkomst zijn beperkt.  

b) Het onder *a* gestelde is niet van toepassing op: 

i) statenloze personen;  

ii) onderdanen van een staat die geen Partij is bij het Noordatlantische Verdrag;  

iii) Duitsers;  

iv) personen die hun gewone verblijfplaats in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek hebben.       
6.  Indien de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht alle of enkele vrijstellingen en voorrechten die aan deze ondernemingen of aan hun werknemers ingevolge dit artikel zijn toegekend intrekken, stellen zij de Duitse autoriteiten hiervan in kennis.   

### Artikel  73  

Technische deskundigen wier diensten nodig zijn voor een krijgsmacht en die op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek uitsluitend die krijgsmacht dienen hetzij in een adviserende hoedanigheid in technische zaken hetzij ten behoeve van de oprichting, het gebruik of het onderhoud van uitrusting, worden beschouwd en behandeld als leden van een civiele dienst. Deze bepaling is echter niet van toepassing op: 

a) statenloze personen;  

b) onderdanen van een staat die geen Partij is bij het Noord-atlantische Verdrag;  

c) Duitsers;  

d) personen die hun gewone verblijfplaats op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek hebben.    

### Artikel  74  

1.  De artikelen XII en XIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag zijn eveneens van toepassing op de regelingen die met betrekking tot de douanerechten en belastingen in deze Overeenkomst getroffen zijn.   
2.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst nemen alle passende maatregelen om misbruiken te voorkomen, die zouden kunnen voortkomen uit de toekenning van voorrechten en vrijstellingen op het gebied van de douanerechten en belastingen. Zij werken nauw met de Duitse autoriteiten samen bij de voorkoming van overtredingen van douane- en belastingvoorschriften.   
3.  De bijzonderheden van de toepassing van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel, met inbegrip van de ingevolge artikel XII, eerste lid van het NAVO-Status Verdrag in acht te nemen voorwaarden, worden vastgesteld bij administratieve overeenkomsten met de Duitse autoriteiten. Deze overeenkomsten houden met name rekening met de volgende punten: 

a) De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en van een civiele dienst dragen er in overeenstemming met de Duitse autoriteiten zorg voor dat bepaalde goederen alleen in redelijke hoeveelheden ter beschikking worden gesteld van de leden van de krijgsmacht, van de civiele dienst of van gezinsleden.  

b) De samenwerking tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst en de Duitse autoriteiten omvat de uitwisseling van de terzake dienende inlichtingen betreffende de verkooporganisaties van de krijgsmacht en de organisaties en commerciële ondernemingen waarvan de krijgsmacht zich bedient en houden tevens in, voorzover noodzakelijk, de daarin uit te voeren in aanmerking komende inspecties.     
4.  De autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst delen - voorzover militaire noodzaak zich hiertegen niet verzet - aan de Duitse autoriteiten op hun verzoek de inlichtingen mede, die redelijkerwijze gevraagd kunnen worden en die noodzakelijk zijn om fiscale verplichtingen van personen of ondernemingen die onderworpen zijn aan belastingheffing op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek, vast te stellen. De Duitse autoriteiten verzoeken de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst slechts om deze inlichtingen, indien zij de voor de vaststelling van het te heffen belastingbedrag noodzakelijke gegevens niet op andere wijze kunnen verkrijgen, bijvoorbeeld uit officiële verklaringen (Abwicklungsscheine) betreffende de levering van goederen en diensten ten aanzien waarvan belastingfaciliteiten gelden indien zulke verklaringen aan de Duitse belastingautoriteiten (Finanzbehörden) zijn verstrekt, of uit inlichtingen die aan deze autoriteiten door andere Duitse autoriteiten kunnen worden gegeven. De Duitse autoriteiten nemen maatregelen om de openbaarmaking van de inlichtingen aan onbevoegde derden te voorkomen.   

### Artikel  75  

1.  

a) Behalve in het geval dat de verdachte een Duitser is, is noch artikel 19 van deze Overeenkomst, noch artikel VII, eerste, tweede en derde lid, van het NAVO-Status Verdrag van toepassing op een voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst gepleegd strafbaar feit waarvan een lid van de krijgsmachten wordt beschuldigd, indien vóór dat tijdstip: 

i) de strafprocedures met betrekking tot een zodanig strafbaar feit zijn aangevangen of beëindigd door een autoriteit van een krijgsmacht die rechtsmacht uitoefent, of  

ii) de vervolging van het strafbaar feit is verjaard door verloop van een bepaalde termijn krachtens de wetgeving van de betrokken staat van herkomst.    

b) Indien strafprocedures aanhangig zijn op de datum van de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst blijven de bepalingen van het Krijgsmachtenverdrag betreffende de uitoefening van rechtsmacht inzake door deze leden gepleegde strafbare feiten op deze procedures tot aan hun beëindiging van toepassing als ware het Krijgsmachtenverdrag nog van kracht, mits de Duitse autoriteiten binnen tien dagen na die datum mededeling van deze aanhangige zaken wordt gedaan.     
2.  Bij het bepalen van de strafmaat ten aanzien van een strafbaar feit gepleegd vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst houdt de Duitse rechtbank of autoriteit naar behoren rekening met de straf voorzien bij de wetgeving van de staat van herkomst waaraan de verdachte onderworpen was op het moment van het plegen van het strafbare feit, indien blijkt dat deze straf lichter is dan die welke is voorgeschreven bij de Duitse wetgeving.   

### Artikel  76  

Verdedigingswerken waarvan de totstandkoming vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst met de Bondsrepubliek is overeengekomen of met de uitvoering waarvan vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst is begonnen, worden volgens de plannen voltooid.  

### Artikel  77  

De Permanente Commissie bedoeld in artikel 17, achtste lid, van het Krijgsmachtenverdrag zet in het belang van de gemeenschappelijke verdediging en de luchtveiligheid voorshands haar werkzaamheden op het gebied van de coördinatie van burger- en militaire luchtvaart voort. Wanneer de Duitse Commissie bedoeld in artikel 57, zevende lid van deze Overeenkomst, alsmede die organisaties die nodig mochten blijken te zijn om de doeltreffende coördinatie tussen de burgerluchtvaart en alle militaire luchtmachten in de Bondsrepubliek te verzekeren, door de Duitse autoriteiten zijn opgericht en in de mogelijkheid verkeren aan de eisen van de krijgsmachten op dit gebied te voldoen, wordt de Permanente Commissie opgeheven na voorafgaand behoorlijk overleg tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de betrokken krijgsmachten.  

### Artikel  78  

1.  De Gemengde Commissie ingesteld ingevolge artikel 44, achtste lid, van het Krijgsmachten verdrag blijft het bevoegde lichaam om te beslissen of een ontslag uit veiligheidsoverwegingen gewettigd was, mits een verzoek overeenkomstig die bepaling door de Commissie vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst werd ontvangen.   
2.  De beslissingen van de Gemengde Commissie blijven ook na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst van kracht voor Duitse rechtbanken in arbeidszaken.   

### Artikel  79  

1.  De belastingfaciliteiten bedoeld in artikel 33, eerste lid en tweede lid, onder *a*, *c* en *d* van het Krijgsmachtenverdrag en in artikel 3 van de Overeenkomst inzake de belastingregeling geldend voor de krijgsmachten en hun leden, zoals die is gewijzigd bij Bijlage V van het Protocol tot beëindiging van het bezettingsregime in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, ondertekend te Parijs op 23 oktober 1954, blijven toegekend met betrekking tot leveranties en andere diensten die na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst in Duitse marken zijn betaald uit het overschot van de bezettingskosten en de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek of uit het overschot uit de fondsen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten, waarover overeenstemming is bereikt voor het tijdvak tot 5 mei 1957.   
2.  Het eerste lid is eveneens van toepassing op leveranties en andere diensten waarvoor opdracht is verstrekt vóór de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst en waarvoor betaling is verricht in Duitse marken uit fondsen die door de Bondsrepubliek als wederzijdse verdedigingshulp vóór die datum aan de krijgsmacht ter beschikking zijn gesteld.   

### Artikel  80  

De bepalingen van artikel XV van het NAVO-Status Verdrag zijn van toepassing op deze Overeenkomst, met dien verstande dat verwijzingen in dat artikel naar andere bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag worden geacht te zijn verwijzingen naar die bepalingen zoals die zijn aangevuld door deze Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  81  

1.  Onder voorbehoud van het gestelde in het tweede lid blijft deze overeenkomst van kracht zolang, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst inzake de aanwezigheid van buitenlandse krijgsmachten in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland van 23 oktober 1954 of een regeling die daarvoor eventueel in de plaats treedt, krijgsmachten in de Bondsrepubliek zijn gelegerd.   
2.  Deze Overeenkomst treedt buiten werking:

### Artikel  82  

Deze Overeenkomst wordt herzien: 

a) wanneer de Overeenkomst inzake de aanwezigheid van buitenndse krijgsmachten in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland van 23 oktober 1954, overeenkomstig artikel 3, tweede lid, van die Overeenkomst, wordt herzien;  

b) op verzoek van een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen na verloop van een tijdvak van drie jaren, te rekenen van de datum van inwerkingtreding af;  

c) 

i) ten aanzien van een of meer bepalingen, indien de bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag waarmee zij rechtstreeks verband houden worden herzien ingevolge artikel XVII van dat Verdrag;  

ii) op elk moment op verzoek van een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ten aanzien van een of meer bepalingen indien de verdere toepassing daarvan naar de opvatting van de Partij die het verzoek indient, voor die Partij bijzonder bezwaarlijk zou zijn, of indien deze toepassing van die Partij redelijkerwijze niet zou kunnen worden verwacht; in deze gevallen worden niet later dan drie maanden na de indiening van het verzoek besprekingen geopend; indien na drie maanden van besprekingen geen overeenstemming is bereikt, kan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zich wenden tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie overeenkomstig de beslissing van de Noordatlantische Raad van 13 december 1956, met het verzoek zijn goede diensten te verlenen en een der in die beslissing genoemde procedures in te leiden; de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen schenken de grootst mogelijke aandacht aan aanbevelingen die uit deze procedure voortvloeien;

####Protocol van Ondertekening bij de Aanvullende Overeenkomst

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst tot aanvulling van het Verdrag tussen de staten die partij zijn bij het Noordatlantische Verdrag nopens de rechtspositie van hun krijgsmachten, met betrekking tot in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland gestationeerde buitenlandse krijgsmachten (hierna te noemen de „Aanvullende Overeenkomst”), bevestigen de ondergetekende vertegenwoordigers van Het Koninkrijk België, Canada, De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, De Franse Republiek, Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, De Verenigde Staten van Amerika en Het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland, dat zij over de volgende protocollen en verklaringen overeenstemming hebben bereikt:     
### DEEL  I  

####Gemeenschappelijke protocollen en verklaringen betreffende het NAVO-Status Verdrag

####Ad artikel I, eerste lid, onder a

1.  Met het oog op de definitie van „krijgsmacht” beschouwt de Bondsrepubliek het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst als mede van toepassing zijnde op krijgsmachten van een staat van herkomst, die zich tijdelijk op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevinden in overeenstemming met artikel 1, derde lid van het Verdrag inzake het verblijf van vreemde krijgsmachten in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland van 23 oktober 1954.   
2.  Militaire attachés van een staat van herkomst in de Bondsrepubliek, de leden van hun staven alsmede ander militair personeel die een diplomatieke of andere speciale status in de Bondsrepubliek genieten, worden niet geacht een „krijgsmacht” te vormen in de zin van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst, of daarvan deel uit te maken.   
3.  De regeringen van de staten van herkomst zullen al het mogelijke doen om - behalve in geval van militaire noodzaak - personen die uitsluitend Duitser zijn niet als lid van een krijgsmacht in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek te stationeren.   
4.  

(a) De volgende financieel zelfstandige organisaties en diensten vormen een integrerend onderdeel van de Amerikaanse krijgsmacht: 

(i) European Exchange System (EES)  

(ii) Air Forces Europe Exchange (AFEX)  

(iii) USAREUR Class VI Agency  

(iv) USAFE Class VI Agency  

(v) European Motion Picture Service  

(vi) USAFE Motion Picture Service  

(vii) USAREUR Special Services Fund  

(viii) USAREUR Special Services Reimbursable Fund  

(ix) American Forces Network  

(x) Dependent Education Group (met inbegrip van scholen voor gezinsleden)  

(xi) Armed Forces Recreation Center Fund  

(xii) Association of American Rod and Gun Clubs in Europe  

(xiii) Stars and Stripes  

(xiv) Andere financieel zelfstandige organisaties met inbegrip van erkende clubs en messes (authorized clubs and messes).    

(b) De onder (*a*) punt (xiv) bedoelde organisaties doen aanschaffingen die vrij van belastingen en rechten zijn door tussenkomst van de officieel aangewezen aanschaffingsdiensten van de krijgsmacht, in overeenstemming met de overeengekomen procedures.  

(c) De lijst van de onder (*a*) vermelde organisaties en diensten kan worden gewijzigd voorzover zulks noodzakelijk is in verband met organisatorische veranderingen.     
5.  Leden van de in Berlijn gestationeerde strijdkrachten van een staat van herkomst, hun civiele diensten en gezinsleden worden beschouwd en behandeld als leden van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst of als gezinsleden, wanneer zij zich als verlofganger op het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevinden.   

####Ad artikel V, eerste lid, tweede volzin

1.  De autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst kunnen de leden van de krijgsmacht vergunning verlenen tot het dragen van burgerkleding in overeenstemming met de voorschriften van de staat van herkomst.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het eerste lid is mede van toepassing op Franse detachementen waarin individuele leden van de krijgsmacht (recruten die zich bij hun onderdelen in de Bondsrepubliek gaan voegen of uit de dienst ontslagenen die naar huis terugkeren) worden ingedeeld, indien de Franse voorschriften dit personeel toestaan in burgerkleding de grens te overschrijden.   

####Ad artikel VII

1.  De Bondsrepubliek beschouwt vergrijpen die worden gestraft langs de weg van een administratieve strafprocedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren), en vergrijpen waartegen slechts een geldboete is bedreigd (Ordnungswidrigkeiten), als volgens het recht van de staat van verblijf strafbare vergrijpen in de zin van artikel VII en van de daarmede rechtstreeks samenhangende bepalingen van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst.   
2.  

(a) Met betrekking tot artikel VII, eerste lid, onder *b*, acht de Bondsrepubliek zich niet bevoegd te beslissen op verzoeken om uitlevering van leden van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of van gezinsleden.  

(b) De staten van herkomst geven geen gevolg aan verzoeken om uitlevering van Duitsers die zich op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek bevinden als leden van een krijgsmacht of als gezinsleden.     

####Ad artikel IX, zesde lid

De Bondsrepubliek is bereid verzoeken om aan gezinsleden faciliteiten op het gebied van reizen en reducties op vervoerkosten te verlenen zeer welwillend te onderzoeken. Dit onderzoek wordt slechts uitgevoerd binnen het raam van de geldende tarieven en indien vergelijkbare omstandigheden bestaan.  

####Ad artikel XIX

De Bondsregering erkent dat het ongewenst zou zijn de rechtspositie van de krijgsmachten ongeregeld te laten. Zij oefent derhalve het haar volgens artikel XIX toekomende recht tot opzegging slechts uit in verband met dringende redenen en niet dan na overleg met de regeringen van de staten van herkomst. Ingeval van opzegging is de Bondsregering bereid onverwijld onderhandelingen met de regeringen van de staten van herkomst te openen over de sluiting van passende vervangende overeenkomsten. Tot de sluiting van zodanige overeenkomsten zou zij de krijgsmachten een positie garanderen die geen afbreuk doet aan de bestendigheid van hun essentiële legeringsvereisten.  

### DEEL  II  

####Gemeenschappelijke protocollen en verklaringen betreffende de Aanvullende Overeenkomst

####Ad artikel 1

Indien de Aanvullende Overeenkomst in werking mocht treden vóór het einde van de overgangsperiode, bedoeld in artikel 1, tweede lid, en in artikel 3 van het op 27 oktober 1956 tussen de Franse Republiek en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland gesloten verdrag ter regeling van de Saarkwestie, zijn de bepalingen van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst die betrekking hebben op aangelegenheden waartoe, ingevolge hoofdstuk II van het genoemde verdrag tussen de Franse Republiek en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, de Duitse bevoegdheid zich niet uitstrekt, in Saarland niet van toepassing vóór het einde van de bovengenoemde periode.  

####Ad artikel 2

De autoriteiten van de krijgsmachten beperken het aantal naaste bloedverwanten in de zin van artikel 2, tweede lid, onder *a*, die in het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek worden toegelaten, zoveel mogelijk.  

####Ad artikel 4

Bij de toepassing van artikel 4 onderhandelen de Duitse autoriteiten uitsluitend met de autoriteiten van die staat van herkomst die de betreffende rechten en verplichtingen uitoefent, onderscheidenlijk vervult.  

####Ad artikel 5

Artikel 5, eerste lid, onder a, is niet van toepassing op het binnenkomen in of verlaten van het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek.  

####Ad artikel 7

Bij de toepassing van de Duitse voorschriften inzake de dienstplicht wordt de tijd die iemand als lid van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of als gezinslid op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek doorbrengt, buiten beschouwing gelaten.  

####Ad artikel 8

1.  Uitwijzing kan slechts geschieden in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving inzake het toezicht van de politie op vreemdelingen (Ausländerpolizeirecht).   
2.  In hoeverre de bepalingen van de thans van kracht zijnde Duitse Politieverordening inzake vreemdelingen (Ausländerpolizeiverordnung) van 22 augustus 1938 inhoudsloos zijn geworden, wordt hieronder aangegeven: 

(a) De volgende in de tekst van de verordening voorkomende uitdrukkingen worden als volgt vervangen: 

(i) „Rijksgebied” door „Bondsgebied”;  

(ii) „Rijk” door „Bond”;  

(iii) „Rijksgrens” door „Bondsgrens”;  

(iv) „Districtspolitiebestuur” (Kreispolizeiverwaltung) door de overeenkomstig het recht van een Land ingestelde „Stads- of Districtsbesturen” (Stadt-, Kreisverwaltungen) voorzover zij de functies van het Districtspolitiebestuur hebben overgenomen;  

(v) „Rijksmark” door „Duitse Mark”;  

(vi) „Rijksminister van Binnenlandse Zaken” door „Bondsminister van Binnenlandse Zaken”.    

(b) ad artikel 5, eerste lid, onder (*a*): De uitdrukking „volksgemeenschap” (Volksgemeinschaft) wordt geacht te zijn geschrapt krachtens artikel II van de Wet nr. 1 van de Controleraad, dat als volgt luidt: „Geen wettelijke Duitse maatregelen, ongeacht hoe of wanneer zij tot stand zijn gekomen, worden door een rechterlijke of bestuurlijke instantie toegepast, indien deze toepassing onrecht of een ongelijke behandeling tot gevolg zou hebben, hetzij 

(a) door een persoon op grond van zijn betrekkingen met nationaal Socialistische Duitse Arbeiders Partij, haar afdelingen, met deze partij verbonden verenigingen of met door deze partij gecontroleerde organities te bevoordelen, hetzij  

(b) door een persoon wegens zijn ras, nationaliteit, religieuze overtuiging of oppositie tegen de Nationaal Socialistische Duitse Arbeiders Partij of haar leerstellingen te benadelen.”    

(c) Ad artikel 5, eerste lid, onder (c): De wettelijke gronden om castratie te doen uitvoeren (artikel 42 *a*, ten 5° en artikel 42 *k* van het Wetboek van Strafrecht) zijn vervallen krachtens artikel I van de Wet nr. 11 van de Controleraad, Bovendien is castratie niet geoorloofd krachtens het gestelde in artikel 2, tweede lid, eerste volzin, van de Grondwet, die als volgt luidt: „Een ieder heeft recht op het leven en op lichamelijke onschendbaarheid.”  

(d) artikel 5, eerste lid, onder (*g*): De uitdrukking „ras” (Rassezugehörigkeit) wordt geacht te zijn vervallen krachtens artikel II van de Wet nr. 1 van de Controleraad (vide onder (*b*)) en krachtens het gestelde in artikel 3, derde lid, van de Grondwet, dat als volgt luidt: „Niemand mag nadeel ondervinden van of bevoorrecht worden door zijn geslacht, afstamming, ras, taal, vaderland en herkomst, geloof of godsdienstige of politieke opvattingen.”  

(e) Ad artikel 5, eerste lid, onder (*h*): De uitdrukking „zigeuner” wordt geacht te zijn vervallen krachtens artikel II van de Wet nr. 1 van de Controleraad (vide onder (*b*)) en krachtens artikel 3, derde lid, van de Grondwet (vide onder (*d*).  

(f) Ad artikel 7, eerste lid, onder (*c*): Ingevolge artikel 16, tweede lid, tweede volzin, van de Grondwet genieten personen die om politieke redenen worden vervolgd, het recht van asiel. Dit recht wordt niet aangetast door artikel 7, eerste lid van de Duitse Politieverordening inzake vreemdelingen. Hetzelfde is van toepassing op buitenlandse vluchtelingen in de zin van de Overeenkomst inzake de rechtspositie van vluchtelingen van 28 juli 1951 (Bundesgesetzblatt 1953, deel II, blz. 559).  

(g) Ad artikel 7, vierde lid en vijfde lid, tweede volzin: Zowel Duitsers als vreemdelingen kunnen slechts gevangen gehouden worden met inachtneming van de volgende bepalingen van artikel 104, tweede en vierde lid, van de Grondwet: 

„2. Over de toelaatbaarheid of het voortduren van een vrijheidsberoving kan alleen de rechter beslissen. Indien een vrijheidsberoving niet rust; op een bevel van een rechter, moet onverwijld een rechterlijke beslissing worden verkregen. De politie kan niemand op eigen gezag langer dan tot het einde van de dag na die van de arrestatie bij zich in arrest houden. Bijzonderheden worden bij de wet geregeld.  

4. Een bloedverwant of een vertrouwensman van de gearresteerde persoon moet onverwijld in kennis gesteld worden van elke rechterlijke beslissing inzake vrijheidsberoving of verlenging daarvan”.    

(h) Ad artikel 7, vijfde lid: Het gestelde onder (*f*) en (*g*) is van toepassing.  

(i) Ad artikel 9, tweede en vierde lid: Arrestatie voorafgaand aan uitwijzing is eveneens slechts toegestaan in overeenstemming met artikel 104, tweede en vierde lid, van de Grondwet (vide onder (*g*).  

(j) Ad artikel 11, eerste lid, laatste volzin, tweede lid, laatste volzin, en vijfde en zesde lid: Deze bepalingen worden geacht te zijn vervallen of niet meer van toepassing te zijn krachtens het gestelde in artikel 19, vierde lid, van de Grondwet dat als volgt luidt: „Ieder wiens recht door het openbare gezag wordt geschonden, heeft het recht van beroep op de rechter. Indien geen andere rechter bevoegd is, kan beroep op de gewone rechter worden gedaan”. Dezelfde bepalingen zijn vervat in de wetten van de Länder inzake administratieve rechtspraak (bijvoorbeeld voor de Länder behorende tot de voormalige Britse bezettingszone - Verordening nr. 165 van het Britse Militair Gezag inzake Rechtsmacht van Administratieve Rechtbanken in de Britse zone - Verordnungsblatt, British Zone 1948, blz. 263).  

(k) Ad artikel 11, vierde lid: De werking van deze bepaling is beperkt voorzover - ingevolge artikel 19, vierde lid van de Grondwet (vide onder (*j*) - het beroep kan worden gedaan op de Administratieve Rechtbank tegen weigering van de opschortende werking van een klacht.  

(l) Ad artikel 14: De bepaling is inhoudsloos door het verstrijken van de tijd.  

(m) Ad artikel 15, eerste lid: In verband met deze bepaling dient rekening te worden gehouden met het gestelde in artikel 116, eerste lid, van de Grondwet, dat als volgt luidt: „Tenzij anders bij de wet wordt bepaald, is een Duitser in de zin van de Grondwet een ieder die de Duitse nationaliteit bezit, of die is toegelaten in het gebied van het Duitse Rijk, zoals dat bestond op 31 december 1937, als vluchteling of verdrevene van Duitse herkomst (Volkszugehörigkeit) of als de echtgenoot of afstammeling van een zodanige persoon”.  

(n) Ad artikel 17, tweede lid: De machtiging om verordeningen niet kracht van wet of van algemene administratieve voorschriften uit te vaardigen is krachtens artikel 129, derde lid, van de Grondwet niet meer van kracht.     
3.  De bepalingen van de Duitse wetgeving betreffende uitwijzing en in het bijzonder artikel 5, eerste lid, van de Politieverordening inzake vreemdelingen is slechts van toepassing indien de daar vermelde gronden voor uitwijzing niet onverenigbaar zijn met de bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst.   

####Ad artikel 12

De uitdrukking „Duitse wetgeving inzake noodweer (Notwehr)” in artikel 12, tweede lid, wordt uitgelegd overeenkomstig de volgende Duitse interpretatie van artikel 53 van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht: 

(a) Artikel 53 van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht luidt als volgt: „Niet strafbaar is hij die een feit begaat dat door noodweer geboden wordt”. Noodweer is die verdediging die noodzakelijk is om een onmiddellijk dreigende wederrechtelijke aanranding van zichzelf of een ander af te wenden. Noodweerexces is niet strafbaar indien de dader de grenzen van verdediging heeft overschreden als gevolg van een hevige gemoedsbeweging, vrees of schrik.  

(b) Bij de interpretatie van artikel 53 van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht heeft de jurisprudentie sinds lang enige vaste beginselen ontwikkeld, die als volgt kunnen worden samengevat: 

(i) Onder „aanranding” wordt begrepen iedere handeling die gericht is op schending van eens anders rechtsgoederen.  

(ii) De aard van de rechtsgoederen die door de aanranding worden bedreigd doet niet ter zake. Een aanranding kan niet slechts gericht zijn tegen lijf of leven doch ook tegen alle wettelijk beschermde belangen, zoals vrijheid, eerbaarheid, eer, eigendom, bezit of jachtrechten.  

(iii) De te verdedigen beschermde belangen behoeven niet toe te behoren aan de verdediger ervan; zij kunnen ook toebehoren aan een ander. In het laatstbedoelde geval spreekt men van hulp in geval van nood (Nothilfe).  

(iv) Iedere aanranding die de aangerande niet gehouden is te dulden, wordt beschouwd als een wederrechtelijke aanranding. Mitsdien is noodweer niet alleen geoorloofd tegenover een dader aan wie schuld kan worden verweten, doch ook tegen een ontoerekeningsvatbare, een geesteszieke, een kind of iemand die handelt in onvermijdbare dwaling.  

(v) Een aanranding wordt beschouwd als een dreigende aanranding indien zij onmiddellijk dreigende is of aan de gang is of voortduurt; een toekomstige of beeindigde aanranding wordt niet beschouwd als een dreigende aanranding. Of een aanranding al dan niet dreigend is, wordt bepaald door de objectieve feiten en niet door het subjectieve oordeel van de persoon die in noodweer handelt.  

(vi) Een aanranding wordt geacht voort te duren en is derhalve dreigende totdat het gevaar dat daaruit voortvloeit ten aanzien van de bedreigde wettelijk beschermde belangen, hetzij volledig voorbij is hetzij - omgekeerd - totdat de aanranding heeft geresulteerd in een onherstelbaar verlies van een zodanig belang. Bijvoorbeeld, indien een dief vlucht met een gestolen voorwerp of een stroper met het gestroopte wild, is noodweer geoorloofd gedurende de onmiddellijke achtervolging en zolang het voorwerp in kwestie, uit het oogpunt van de dader, niet in veiligheid is gebracht.  

(vii) Noodweer moet noodzakelijk zijn om een aanranding af te wenden. Deze noodzakelijkheid wordt van geval tot geval vastgesteld door toepassing van objectieve maatstaven. In beginsel wordt de mate van geoorloofde noodweer bepaald door de ernst en de hardnekkigheid van de aanranding en door de middelen die de aangerande persoon voor zijn verdediging ter beschikking staan.  

(viii) Een wettelijk beschermd belang van de aanrander wordt geacht zonder noodzaak te zijn aangetast, indien de door de aanranding bedreigde persoon in staat is de aanranding te ontwijken zonder van zijn eigen belangen afstand te doen.  

(ix) In het algemeen is het niet noodzakelijk dat de waarde van de wettelijk beschermde belangen van de aangerande persoon worden afgewogen tegen het verlies dat de aanrander zou kunnen lijden (beginsel van evenredigheid). Dit beginsel is echter onderworpen aan beperkingen. Het doden van een dief is niet een vereiste (noodzakelijke) daad van verdediging indien de voorwerpen die de aangerande persoon dreigt te verliezen slechts van geringe waarde zijn (over dit beginsel bestaat verschil van mening).  

(x) Het is voldoende dat de noodweer wordt vereist om een aanranding van de eigen of eens anders persoon af te wenden. Het is niet noodzakelijk dat de aanranding is gericht tegen een bloedverwant in de zin van artikel 52, tweede lid van het Duitse Wetboek van Strafrecht.  

(xi) Slechts voorzover een verdedigingshandeling is gericht tegen de aanrander, wordt een verdedigingshandeling beschouwd als noodweer ter afwering van een wederrechtelijke aanranding. Handelingen die rechtsgoederen van derden die er niet bij betrokken zijn schenden worden niet door noodweer als zodanig gedekt. Onder bepaalde omstandigheden kunnen de daders van zodanige handelingen ongestraft blijven op grond van overmacht (Notstand).      

####Ad artikel 19

1.  Het verzoek om afstand van het recht van de Bondsrepubliek om bij voorrang rechtsmacht in strafzaken uit te oefenen, bedoeld in artikel 19, eerste lid, wordt door die staten van herkomst die reeds besloten hebben gebruik te maken van de afstand van dat voorrangsrecht, gedaan bij het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst. De Bondsrepubliek doet ten gunste van die staten afstand van haar voorrangsrecht bij het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst. Indien een staat van herkomst na het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst besluit gebruik te maken van de afstand van het voorrangsrecht, verzoekt die staat hierom eerst nadat met de Bondsregering overeenstemming is bereikt omtrent de noodzakelijke overgangsregelingen.   
2.  

(a) Onder voorbehoud van een zorgvuldig onderzoek naar elk afzonderlijk geval en naar de resultaten van een zodanig onderzoek, kunnen essentiële belangen van de Duitse rechtspleging, in de zin van artikel 19, derde lid, de uitoefening van rechtsmacht door de Duitse autoriteiten in het bijzonder in de volgende gevallen noodzakelijk maken: 

(i) delicten, waarvan in eerste en laatste aanleg wordt sgenomen door het Bondsgerechtshof (Bundesgerichtshof), of delicten die door de Procureur-Generaal (Generalbundesanwalt) bij het Bondsgerechtshof vervolgd kunnen worden;  

(ii) delicten die de dood van een mens veroorzaken, diefstal met geweldpleging of bedreiging, verkrachting, voorzover niet gepleegd tegen een lid van een krijgsmacht, van een civiele dienst of een gezinslid;  

(iii) poging tot zodanige delicten of deelneming daaraan.    

(b) De betrokken autoriteiten werken met betrekking tot de onder *(a)* genoemde delicten zeer nauw samen van de aanvang van het voorbereidende onderzoek af, teneinde de in artikel VII, zesde lid, van het NAVO-Status Verdrag edoelde wederzijdse hulp te verlenen.     

####Ad artikel 22

De staten van herkomst behouden het recht de gearresteerde, hetzij in een eigen inrichting voor de bewaring van arrestanten, hetzij bij haar krijgsmacht in bewaring te houden. Teneinde een soepele vervulling van hun verplichtingen ingevolge artikel 22, derde lid, tweede volzin, te verzekeren, houden de autoriteiten van de staten van herkomst de gearresteerde voorzover mogelijk in bewaring in de nabijheid van de standplaats van de Duitse autoriteit die de zaak behandelt, zonder dat echter de verplichting bestaat de gearresteerde buiten het eigen gebied van de krijgsmacht onder te brengen.  

####Ad artikel 26, eerste lid, onder (b)

De uitdrukking „militaire noodzaak” kan ook worden toegepast op gevallen waarin het delict werd gepleegd door een persoon die zich in verband met oefeningen of manoeuvres tijdelijk op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek ophield.  

####Ad artikel 31

1.  De artikelen 17 tot en met 24 van het Haagse Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering van 17 juli 1905 worden in de betrekkingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de Franse Republiek beschouwd als een overeenkomst in de zin van artikel 31, tot het tijdstip waarop het Haagse Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering van 1 maart 1954 in werking treedt.   
2.  Met betrekking tot de aansprakelijkheid voor fouten begaan door ambtenaren in functie, geldt zowel tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de Franse Republiek als tussen de Bondsrepubliek en het Koninkrijk België het volgende: 

De aansprakelijkheid van de staat (Bund of Land) of van een publiekrechtelijk lichaam voor schade geleden door een lid van Belgische of Franse krijgsmacht, van hun civiele diensten of door hun gezinsleden als gevolg van fouten, door personen die in de Bondsrepubliek in Duitse openbare dienst zijn als zodanig begaan, wordt beheerst door de voor Duitse onderdanen (Inländer) geldende voorschriften.     

####Ad artikel 41

1.  Artikel 41 is niet van toepassing op aanspraken wegens schade die voortvloeit uit contracten of daaraan verwante rechtsverhoudingen.   
2.  

(a) 

(i) Ingeval van schade aan openbare wegen en van schade aan eigendommen van de Bondsrepubliek - met uitzondering van schade aan eigendommen van de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen en van de Duitse Bondsposterijen - die veroorzaakt is door manoeuvres en andere oefeningen, en waarvoor schadevergoeding zou moeten worden betaald ingevolge artikel 41, kan de krijgsmacht, in plaats van schadevergoeding te betalen, zelf die schade herstellen,  

(ii) Indien een krijgsmacht schade aan openbare wegen zelf wenst te herstellen, raadpleegt zij de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten en ziet zij af van haar voornemen zelf het herstel uit te voeren, indien deze autoriteiten daartegen bezwaar maken op grond van gewichtige redenen van wegenbouwtechnische aard of verband houdende met de uitoefening van het politietoezicht op het verkeer. In deze gevallen en in de andere gevallen van schade, genoemd onder (i), is het niet noodzakelijk in individuele gevallen de Duitse autoriteiten te raadplegen, indien vooraf een algemene gedragslijn is vastgesteld ten aanzien van het uitvoeren van herstellingen door de krijgsmacht.    

(b) Het staat de krijgsmacht vrij in andere dan de onder (*a*) genoemde gevallen de schade zelf te herstellen, in overleg met de benadeelde.  

(c) In de onder (*a*) en (*b*) bedoelde gevallen staat het de benadeelde vrij hem eventueel toekomende aanspraken op hadeloosstelling geldend te maken, indien hij van mening is dat de schade niet volledig of niet behoorlijk is hersteld.     
3.  Teneinde een snelle afwikkeling van schadeloosstellingsprocedures mogelijk te maken verdient het aanbeveling een redelijke termijn vast te stellen, binnen welke aanspraken op schadeloosstelling op de voet van artikel VIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag, in verband met artikel 41, moeten worden geldend gemaakt. Te dien einde treft de Bondsrepubliek passende wettelijke voorzieningen.   
4.  De afstand van aanspraken door de Bondsrepubliek, bedoeld in artikel 41, derde lid, onder (*a*), is niet van toepassing op schade, voortvloeiende uit niet-nakoming van de aanvaarde verantwoordelijkheid voor herstel en onderhoud. Voorzover de betreffende overeenkomsten (Überlassungsvereinbarungen) geen voorzieningen voor de afwikkeling van zodanige schade behelzen, wordt de procedure ter afwikkeling daarvan neergelegd in administratieve overeenkomsten.   
5.  Voorzover eigendommen van rechtspersonen waarvan de aandelen zich in handen van de Bond (Bund) bevinden, kosteloos aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst ter beschikking zijn gesteld om uitsluitend door die krijgsmacht of civiele dienst te worden gebruikt, vrijwaart de Bondsrepubliek de staat van herkomst tegen aanspraken op grond van schade aan die eigendommen in dezelfde mate als de Bondsrepubliek overeenkomstig artikel 41, derde lid, onder (*a*), afstand heeft gedaan van haar aanspraken op vergoeding van schade aan haar eigendommen.   
6.  

(a) Indien in de gevallen, bedoeld in artikel 41, derde lid,onder (*a*), laatste volzin, en vijfde lid, laatste volzin, tussen de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht verschil van mening bestaat ten aanzien van de vraag of de schade al dan niet opzettelijk of door grove nalatigheid is veroorzaakt, treden de autoriteiten van beide partijen in onderhandeling.  

(b) Blijft er verschil van mening bestaan, dat niet kan worden opgelost door verdere onderhandelingen tussen de partijen op hoger niveau, dan wordt de beslissing genomen door de arbiter, bedoeld in artikel VIII, tweede lid, onder (*a*), van het NAVO-Status Verdrag.     
7.  Met betrekking tot eigendommen van een Land, die aan een krijgsmacht voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld (artikel 41, vierde lid), stellen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten gemeenschappelijk vast in welke toestand die eigendommen zich bevinden op het tijdstip van inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst. Een zodanige vaststelling vindt eveneens plaats op het tijdstip waarop de betreffende eigendommen worden vrijgegeven. Eventuele vorderingen terzake van schade of verlies worden afgewikkeld op basis van de toestand waarin de eigendommen zich op genoemde tijdstippen bevonden.   
8.  Het Amerikaanse Rode Kruis en de Universiteit van Maryland worden niet beschouwd of behandeld als integrerende onderdelen van de krijgsmacht in de zin van artikel 41, zevende lid, en zijn met betrekking tot de afwikkeling van vorderingen terzake van schade niet onttrokken aan de Duitse rechtsmacht.   
9.  De administratieve overeenkomsten, bedoeld in artikel 41, dertiende lid, kunnen ook regelingen behelzen die afwijken van de procedure-regelingen, vervat in artikel VIII van het NAVO-Status Verdrag.   

####Ad artikel 47

In de administratieve overeenkomsten, bedoeld in artikel 47, vijfde lid onder (*g*), wordt de volgende clausule opgenomen: 

„Teneinde de Duitse autoriteiten in staat te stellen de Duitse begrotingsvoorschriften na te leven, wordt in de schriftelijke toestemming, bedoeld in artikel 47, vijfde lid onder (*c*) van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst, de officiële verklaring opgenomen, dat de vereiste middelen op de begroting beschikbaar zijn.”    

####Ad artikel 48

1.  

(a) Indien ter uitvoering van artikel 48, eerste lid onder (*c*), derde volzin, gebruikscontracten (Nutzungsverträge), duidingscontracten (Duldungsverträge) of dergelijke contracten gesloten worden, sluiten de Duitse autoriteiten overeenkomsten inzake de omvang van de te betalen schadeloosstelling, in overleg met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst, behalve in zoverre die schadeloosstelling door de Bondsrepubliek moet worden gedragen ingevolge artikel 63, vijfde lid, onder (*a*). Hetzelfde geldt, ingeval op grond van de wet inzake de verwerving van terreinen een onroerend goed wordt gevorderd, ten aanzien van overeenkomsten inzake de omvang van een schadeloosstelling voor voorlopige inbezitneming (Besitzeinweisungsentschädigung) of een andersoortige schadeloosstelling. Artikel 63 is onverminderd van kracht.  

(b) De onder (*a*) bedoelde procedure is van overeenkomstige toepassing, indien in het kader van de wet beperking grondeigendom of de Luchtverkeerswet gebruikscontracten, duidingscontracten of dergelijke contracten worden gesloten in het belang van een krijgsmacht, of indien overeenkomsten worden gesloten inzake de omvang van schadeloosstellingen terzake van beperkingen in de eigendom van onroerende goederen (Schutzbereichentschädigungen).     
2.  Met betrekking tot artikel 48, tweede lid, en onverminderd de regelingen neergelegd in het vijfde lid, onder (*a*) en (*b*), van dat artikel, treden de autoriteiten van een staat van herkomst in bijzondere gevallen, op verzoek van de Bondsregering, in onderhandeling over de teruggave of omruiling van onroerende goederen die zich reeds op 5 mei 1955, te 12.00 uur, in het bezit van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst bevonden, teneinde rekening te houden met essentiële Duitse civiele belangen en met name met de eisen van ruimtelijke ordening en stedebouw (Raumordnung und Städtebau), natuurbescherming en met de belangen van landbouw en economie. De autoriteiten van de staat van herkomst nemen verzoeken van de Bondsregering hierbij in welwillende overweging.   
3.  Met betrekking tot artikel 48, tweede lid en vijfde lid onder (*c*), geldt het volgende: Ter vermijding van moeilijkheden in gevallen waarin met betrekking tot onroerende goederen die aan een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld, de rechtsverhouding met de eigenaar of andere rechthebbende eindigt, en om de Bondsrepubliek de vervulling van haar verplichting neergelegd in artikel 48, tweede lid eerste volzin, te vergemakkelijken, onderhouden de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht een voortdurend en nauw contact met elkander. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht lichten de Duitse autoriteiten zo vroegtijdig mogelijk in, indien in een zodanig geval de behoefte aan onroerende goederen ook na de datum waarop de rechtsverhouding eindigt, voortduurt. Teneinde de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht in staat te stellen zich in die zin uit te spreken, stellen de Duitse autoriteiten de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht zo vroegtijdig mogelijk en voorzover noodzakelijk er van op de hoogte, dat de rechtsverhouding met de eigenaar of andere rechthebbende eindigt onder mededeling van het tijdstip waarop dit zal geschieden; dit geldt in het bijzonder in gevallen waarin de rechtsverhouding eindigt om een andere reden dan door de afloop van een huur- of pachtcontract.   
4.  Als bijzonderheden in de zin van artikel 48, derde lid, onder (*a*), eerste volzin, met betrekking tot het gebruik van een onroerend goed worden met name aangemerkt de duur van de beschikbaarheid, de wijze van gebruik, de aansprakelijkheid voor herstellingen, onderhoud en maatregelen met het oog op de verkeersveiligheid, alsmede alle eventueel in het kader van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst noodzakelijke financiële regelingen.   
5.  

(a) In de op de voet van artikel 48, derde lid onder (*b*), te sluiten overeenkomsten hebben de gegevens inzake de inventaris van de rechtens in eigendom aan de Bond of een Land toebehorende (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehende) onroerende goederen - met uitzondering van onroerende goederen van de Duitse Bondsspoorwegen en de Duitse Bondsposterijen - slechts betrekking op voorwerpen voor de verwijdering waarvan op grond van artikel 50 toestemming van, of voorafgaande kennisgeving aan, de Duitse autoriteiten vereist is. De staat van onderhoud, waarin het onroerend goed verkeert, wordt op verzoek van de autoriteiten van de betrokken krijgsmacht uitgedrukt in algemene termen, zoals „goed”, „middelmatig” of „slecht”.  

(b) Technische bijzonderheden en bijzonderheden inzake de procedure worden, voorzover noodzakelijk, nader geregeld bij administratieve overeenkomst.     
6.  De op grond van artikel 48, vierde lid, bestaande verplichting tot het uitvoeren van herstel- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden omvat niet de herbouw van een gebouw dat geheel of grotendeels is verwoest als gevolg van een geval van overmacht.   
7.  De onderhandelingen die ingevolge artikel 48, vijfde lid, onder (*a*), tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten worden gevoerd over de vraag of een onroerend goed dat door de Bondsrepubliek ter vervanging is aangeboden voldoet aan de vereisten van de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst, strekken zich, voorzover noodzakelijk, uit tot financiële vraagstukken die in dit verband rijzen.   

####Ad artikel 50

1.  Artikel 50 mag in geen geval zo worden uitgelegd, dat het toegestaan is goederen die geen eigendom van de Bond zijn en behoren tot de inrichting en de inboedel van een onroerend goed, zonder toestemming van de eigenaar van het ene onroerende goed over te brengen naar het andere.   
2.  Indien de bouwtechnische gegevens niet meer ter beschikking staan, stellen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten volgens de criteria die op gelijksoortige gebouwen toepasselijk zijn, gemeenschappelijk vast welke voorwerpen vallen onder het bepaalde in artikel 50, onder (*a*).   

####Ad artikel 51

1.  Indien het oneconomisch is een voorwerp naar het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek terug te brengen, bijvoorbeeld indien de transportkosten de waarde van het voorwerp te boven gaan, geven de Duitse autoriteiten toestemming tot verkoop van dat voorwerp in het buitenland.   
2.  De overbrenging van roerende goederen, die zijn aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek of van middelen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten, van het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek naar Berlijn (West) voor het gebruik door de aldaar gelegerde strijdkrachten van de staat van herkomst, wordt niet beschouwd als verwijdering uit de Bondsrepubliek in de zin van artikel 51. Op naar Berlijn (West) overgebrachte roerende goederen zijn de bepalingen van het eerste en het tweede lid van dat artikel van toepassing. Op verdere overbrenging naar een andere plaats van bestemming dan het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek zijn de bepalingen van het derde en het vierde lid van dat artikel van toepassing.   
3.  Ongeacht de bijzondere status van Saarland op het gebied van douane, belastingen en vreemde valuta, gedurende de overgangsperiode, bedoeld in artikel 1, tweede lid en artikel 3 van het Verdrag tussen de Franse Republiek en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland tot regeling van de Saarkwestie, van 27 oktober 1956, is artikel 51 van toepassing op roerende goederen die zijn aangeschaft ten laste van de middelen ter bestrijding van de bezettingskosten, van de begroting van de Bondsrepubliek of van middelen ter bestrijding van onderhoudskosten en die zich in Saarland bevinden, evenals op de overbrenging van die goederen van Saarland naar plaatsen buiten de Bondsrepubliek. Artikel 51 is tot het einde van de bovengenoemde overgangsperiode van overeenkomstige toepassing op de overbrenging van zodanige goederen van andere delen van de Bondsrepubliek naar Saarland.   
4.  De woorden „noodzakelijk in verband met de vervulling van de verdedigingstaak van de Noordatlantische Verdragsorganisatie”, die voorkomen in artikel 51, derde lid, mogen niet zo worden uitgelegd, dat een speciale richtlijn van de NAVO vereist is.   
5.  Contracten inzake het gebruik van spoorwagons, gesloten krachtens artikel 57, tweede lid, van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst, blijven, tenzij anders wordt overeengekomen, van kracht zelfs indien die wagons op grond van artikel 51, derde lid, uit het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek verwijderd worden.   
6.  De overeenkomsten bedoeld in artikel 51, vierde lid, worden gesloten in de geest van de wederzijdse hulp bedoeld in artikel 3 van het Noordatlantische Verdrag.   

####Ad artikel 52

Bij het bereiken van overeenstemming over de restwaarde gaan de Duitse autoriteiten uit van het militaire of economische nut, dat de achtergelaten inrichtingen, uitrustingsstukken of voorraden voor henzelf hebben, of van de eventuele netto-opbrengst van de verkoop.  

####Ad artikel 53

1.  Tenzij anders is bepaald, is een krijgsmacht niet gerechtigd onroerende goederen die haar voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn gesteld, te exploiteren ter verkrijging van economisch voordeel.   
2.  De exploitatie door de rechthebbende wordt slechts beperkt voorzover zulks noodzakelijk is om het doel, vermeld in artikel 53, eerste lid, eerste volzin, te verwerkelijken.   
3.  De uitdrukking „gebieden waarin de rechten van de grondeigenaar kunnen worden beperkt (Schutzbereich)” wordt overeenkomstig de Duitse wetgeving geïnterpreteerd. Met de uitdrukking „passende maatregelen” in de zin van artikel 53, zesde lid, worden alleen bedoeld die maatregelen die door de Duitse autoriteiten in het kader van hun wettelijke bevoegdheid kunnen worden getroffen.   
4.  Indien de Duitse wetgeving ter uitvoering van artikel 53 onvoldoende blijkt te zijn om te verzekeren, dat de verdedigingsverplichtingen van een krijgsmacht op bevredigende wijze kunnen worden vervuld, bespreken de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht de wenselijkheid of de noodzakelijkheid om een wijziging van die wetgeving te bevorderen.   
5.  De samenwerking tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten met betrekking tot het beheer van goederen die door de Bondsrepubliek aan de krijgsmacht voor gebruik ter beschikking zijn of worden gesteld, strekken zich met name uit tot de volgende gebieden: 

(a) vaststelling van de grenzen van terreinen, de opstelling van situatieschetsen en kadastrale bewijsstukken van percelen land (Grundstücke);  

(b) de opstelling van lijsten vermeldende de goederen, inventarisatie, taxatie van de goederen;  

(c) de openbare orde en veiligheid, met inbegrip van brandbeveiliging, voorkoming van ongevallen en veiligheidsmaatregelen zoals die betreffende schietbanen, munitieopslagplaatsen, brandstoffendepôts en gevaarlijke inrichtingen;  

(d) gezondheidszorg (overeenkomstig artikel 54);  

(e) arbeidsinspectie (Gewerbeaufsicht);  

(f) water-, gas- en elektriciteitsvoorziening, drainering en de voer van afvalwater;  

(g) eigendomsbeperking, burenrecht, ruimtelijke ordening, bescherming van monumenten en natuurreservaten;  

(h) instandhouding van terreinen en gebouwen;  

(i) openbare nutsbedrijven en inrichtingen voor de levering van verwarming, indien deze bedrijven of inrichtingen niet slechts ten dienste staan van de krijgsmacht maar ook van Duitse diensten of de burgerbevolking;  

(k) gebruik van terreinen en gebouwen door de burgerbevolking of de Duitse autoriteiten voor industriële, landbouwkundige of huisvestingsdoeleinden;  

(l) exploitatie van bossen, de jacht en visserij;  

(m) exploitatie van bodemschatten;  

(n) verkeersveiligheid, evenals onderhoud en reiniging van voor het openbare verkeer openstaande wegen;  

(o) exploitatie en onderhoud van spoorwegverbindingen;  

(p) verreberichtgeving.     
6.  Bij de samenwerking tussen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten wordt als volgt gehandeld: 

(a) De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten wijzen vertegenwoordigers aan voor een of meer onroerende goederen. De vertegenwoordigers van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse vertegenwoordigers werken samen om te verzekeren dat naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met de belangen van de krijgsmacht en de Duitse bengen. Zij komen de eventueel noodzakelijke maatregelen ter verwezenlijking van de samenwerking overeen.  

(b) De militaire commandant die voor het onroerend goed verantwoordelijk is, of een andere bevoegde autoriteit van de krijgsmacht, verleent aan de Duitse vertegenwoordigers en de door hen aangewezen deskundigen alle bijstand die redelijkerwijs noodzakelijk is om de Duitse belangen veilig te stellen, met inbegrip van toegang tot het onroerend goed, waarbij echter steeds de eisen der militaire veiligheid in aanmerking worden genomen.  

(c) Ongeacht het bepaalde onder (*a*) en (*b*) is het volgende van toepassing: 

(i) de lijsten vermeldende de goederen en de inventarissen bedoeld in het vijfde lid onder (*b*) worden in het algemeen opgesteld of geverifieerd bij het begin en aan het einde van de periode gedurende welke een onroerend goed voor gebruik ter beschikking is gesteld aan de krijgsmacht;  

(ii) de samenwerking op het gebied van veiligheidsmaatregelen met betrekking tot schietbanen, munitie-opslagplaatsen en brandstoffendepôts vindt in het algemeen plaats in gemengde commissies. De bijzonderheden van deze procedure worden geregeld in administratieve overeenkomsten.       
7.  Indien bepalingen van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst of bijzondere NAVO-regelingen voor bepaalde onroerende goederen een andere procedure voorschrijven ten aanzien van de samenwerking op de gebieden bedoeld in het vijfde lid, prevaleren deze bepalingen of bijzondere regelingen.   

####Ad artikel 54, eerste lid

Indien het voor een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst om wettelijke of technische redenen onmogelijk is tot in bijzonderheden te voldoen aan een Duits voorschrift inzake de gezondheid, komen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht onverwijld andere maatregelen overeen ter bereiking van het in het voorschrift beoogde doel.  

####Ad artikel 56, negende lid

1.  De individuele administratieve onderdelen en inrichtingen (Betriebe) van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, zoals door de betrokken krijgsmacht omschreven, worden beschouwd als diensten in de zin van de Wet inzake de vertegenwoordiging van personeel (Personalvertretungsgesetz) van 5 augustus 1955 (Bundesgesetzblatt, Deel I, blz. 477), hierna te noemen „de Wet”. De hoofdkwartieren die administratief rechtstreeks ondergeschikt zijn aan de hoogste autoriteit van een krijgsmacht en waaraan andere diensten administratief ondergeschikt zijn, zijn de bemiddelingsautoriteiten.   
2.  Er zijn geen gemeenschappelijke ondernemingsraden (Gesamtbetriebsräte). Ondernemingsraden op hoger dan plaatselijk niveau (Stufenvertretungen) worden slechts ingesteld op het niveau van de bemiddelingsautoriteiten als districtsondernemingsraden; deze raden bestaan uit niet meer dan elf leden. Voor dienstreizen van leden van een districtsondernemingsraad wordt een reiskostenvergoeding toegekend overeenkomstig de tariefregelingen voor reiskostenvergoedingen voor betaalde burgerwerknemers van de krijgsmacht, doch tenminste volgens de op een na hoogste schaal.   
3.  Bij de besprekingen met de ondernemingsraden kan het hoofd van de dienst zich laten vertegenwoordigen door een persoon die in de leiding van de dienst een verantwoordelijke positie bekleedt. Het hoofd van de dienst is niet verplicht het kiescollege voor de verkiezing van plaatselijke ondernemingsraden aan te wijzen. Aanvragen van de vakverenigingen om vergaderingen van het personeel uit te schrijven voor de verkiezing van het kiescollege worden schriftelijk ingediend.   
4.  De duur van de dienstverhouding bij de dienst die vereist is om verkiesbaar te zijn voor de ondernemingsraden, is één jaar.   
5.  De ondernemingsraden blijven één jaar in functie.   
6.  Het hoofd van de dienst is niet verplicht aan leden van ondernemingsraden bescheiden over te leggen, die uit veiligheidsoverwegingen zijn geclassificeerd. Om dezelfde redenen en in overeenstemming met speciale richtlijnen, uitgegeven door de hoogste autoriteit van de krijgsmacht, kan een lid van de ondernemingsraad worden beperkt in zijn recht van toegang tot de diensten van de krijgsmacht; hetzelfde is van toepassing op andere personen die, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de Wet, de zittingen van de ondernemingsraad kunnen bijwonen.   
7.  In de gevallen waarin de bepalingen van de Wet voorzien in het recht van medezeggenschap, is de samenwerkingsprocedure (Mitwirkungsverfahren) van toepassing. Overeenkomsten tot het verrichten van diensten (Dienstvereinbarungen) kunnen op basis van vrijwilligheid worden gesloten, indien zij toelaatbaar zijn op grond van de Wet, en indien het hoofd van de dienst gemachtigd is zulke overeenkomsten te sluiten. De bepalingen van de Wet inzake de gronden voor weigering van de goedkeuring voor bevordering, terugstelling en overplaatsing zijn niet van toepassing.   
8.  Voorzover zulks onverenigbaar is met de vervulling van de verdedigingsverplichtingen van de krijgsmacht is het hoofd van de dienst niet verplicht ontwerpen van administratieve regelingen vóórdat zij worden uitgegeven, aan de ondernemingsraad over te leggen en met deze raad te bespreken. Bij het onderzoek van ongevallen wordt de ondernemingsraad betrokken, tenzij voorschriften inzake de militaire veiligheid en discipline de aanwezigheid van leden van de ondernemingsraad uitsluiten.   
9.  De ondernemingsraad verleent zijn medewerking bij alle maatregelen betreffende de medische en gezondheidsdienst voor de werknemers, met uitzondering wat de aanwijzing van artsen betreft.   
10.  Indien de Wet voorziet in rechterlijke beslissingen, beslissen Duitse rechtbanken in arbeidszaken de zaken in overeenstemming met de procedure ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving (Beschlussverfahren) en de Bondsrepubliek handelt in de procedures op verzoek van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst in hun naam.   
11.  Op verzoek van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst maakt de door de Bondsrepubliek aangewezen dienst een strafvervolging aanhangig wegens schending van geheimhouding (Verletzung der Schweigepflicht) overeenkomstig de strafbepalingen van de Wet.   
12.  De ondernemingsraden die op regelmatige wijze zijn verkozen en die op het moment van het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst bestaan, beëindigen hun functies uiterlijk zes maanden na die datum.   

####Ad artikel 57, derde lid

Gedurende de dooiperiode worden door de Duitse autoriteiten geplaatste speciale verkeerstekens, of door deze autoriteiten uitgegeven speciale voorschriften, opgevolgd, behalve in geval van ongelukken, rampen of noodtoestand.  

####Ad artikel 58

De militaire vervoersdiensten van een krijgsmacht kunnen in beperkte mate de door Duitse diensten in bedrijf gehouden bijzondere interne telefoonnetten blijven gebruiken, onder voorbehoud van het sluiten van administratieve overeenkomsten, mits: 

(a) het aantal bestaande aansluitingen niet wordt verhoogd;  

(b) dit aantal onmiddellijk na de inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst gemeenschappelijk wordt onderzocht en zoveel mogelijk wordt verminderd;  

(c) vervolgens het aantal aansluitingen bij wederzijdse overeenkomst in toenemende mate wordt verminderd en deze aansluitingen tenslotte worden opgeheven, zodra de technische ontwikkeling van het openbare telefoonnet of een daarvoor in de plaats tredend militair net een zodanig uitzonderlijk gebruik overbodig maakt.    

####Ad artikel 60

1.  Indien de Duitse Bondsposterijen voornemens zijn de voorschriften inzake het gebruik van inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving bedoeld in artikel 60, eerste lid, tweede volzin, te wijzigen of nieuwe voorschriften terzake in te voeren en een krijgsmacht daarbij is betrokken, wordt de krijgsmacht hiervan zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis gesteld en in ieder geval niet later dan één maand vóór de inwerkingtreding van de bovenbedoelde voorschriften, opdat eventueel nodige besprekingen kunnen plaatsvinden. De krijgsmacht dient voldoende tijd te worden gegeven om de daardoor nodige veranderingen aan te brengen in de inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving of de vereiste administratieve procedures.   
2.  Diensten ten behoeve van de luchtvaart en meteorologische diensten maken deel uit van de radiocommunicatiemiddelen vallend onder artikel 60, tweede lid, onder (*b*) en (*c*).   
3.  

(a) Het gestelde in artikel 60, vierde lid onder (*b*), heeft betrekking op inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving waarvan de installatie niet op andere wijze toegelaten is krachtens dat artikel.  

(b) Indien de termijn van zes maanden vastgesteld in artikel 60, vierde lid, onder (*b*), overschreden wordt als gevolg van omstandigheden onafhankelijk van de wil van de krijgsmacht of van de dienst die belast is met de uitvoering (b.v. stakingen of materiaalgebrek), wordt een bijzondere overeenkomst gesloten inzake de verlenging van die termijn. De termijn van zes maanden is niet van toepassing op inrichtingen voor verreberichtgeving van de krijgsmacht tot de oprichting waarvan de Duitse Bondsposterijen zich bij contract - gesloten voor de inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst - hebben verbonden. Deze inrichtingen kunnen op ieder tijdstip na de inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst in gebruik worden genomen.     
4.  Het recht bedoeld in artikel 60, vijfde lid, onder (*a*), om radio- en televisiezendstations te installeren en in bedrijf te stellen heeft geen invloed op aangelegenheden betreffende auteursrecht.   
5.  

(a) Een krijgsmacht gebruikt slechts de haar door de Duitse autoriteiten toegewezen frequenties. Toewijzingen van frequenties gedaan vóór het in werking treden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst blijven geldig. De autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht stellen de Duitse autoriteiten in kennis van frequenties die zij niet langer nodig hebben. Indien op grond van internationale verplichtingen, internationale betrekkingen of essentiële Duitse belangen, de Duitse autoriteiten het noodzakelijk achten een toegewezen frequentie te wijzigen of in te trekken, plegen zij, alvorens zulks te doen, overleg met de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht.  

(b) De procedure voor de toewijzing van frequenties, voor het wijzigen of intrekken van reeds toegewezen frequenties en voor een versnelde toewijzing van frequenties ten behoeve van tijdelijk gebruik bij manoeuvres wordt vastgelegd in ijzondere overeenkomst tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht. Een zodanige overeenkomst wordt gesloten in overeenstemming met de van kracht zijnde procedures, richtlijnen en aanbevelingen van de NAVO.  

(c) De betrokken krijgsmacht neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn om de bevoegde NAVO-autoriteit in staat te stellen de frequenties te beschermen. De Duitse autoriteiten nemen slechts op verzoek van de autoriteiten van de betrokken krijgsmacht maatregelen die nodig zijn om andere internationale organisaties, in het bijzonder de Internationale Vereniging voor Verreberichtgeving, in staat te stellen de frequenties te beschermen.  

(d) De Duitse autoriteiten verstrekken andere diensten en organisaties slechts met toestemming van de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht inlichtingen omtrent frequenties die oor een krijgsmacht worden gebruikt.  

(e) Indien radioinstallaties van een krijgsmacht radioinstallaties die buiten het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek zijn gevestigd storen of door dergelijke installaties zelf worden gestoord, handelen de Duitse autoriteiten overenkomstig het op dat moment van kracht zijnde Internationale Verdrag betreffende Verreberichtgeving en de daarbij behorende Radioreglementen, tenzij bijzondere reenkomsten zijn gesloten met de staat van herkomst in het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek de betrokken radioinstallaties in bedrijf heeft.  

(f) Een krijgsmacht is slechts gebonden aan de bepalingen vervat in Bijlage 3 en 4 van de Radioreglementen van Atlantic City 1947 of aan de bepalingen die daarvoor eventueel in de plaats treden voorzover zulks redelijkerwijs van haar kan worden verwacht met het oog op de vervulling van haar verdedigingsverplichtingen.     
6.  

(a) Behalve met de overeenkomsten bedoeld in artikel 60, achtste lid, houdt een krijgsmacht eveneens rekening met de bepalingen van de volgende internationale overeenkomsten die de Bondsrepubliek, alhoewel zij daarbij geen partij is, toch binnen haar grondgebied toepast: 

(i) European Regional Convention for the Maritime Mobile Radio Service, Kopenhagen, 1948;  

(ii) Frequency Allocation Plan for the Aeronautical Mobile Service and Final Act, Genève, 1948/49;  

(iii) Final Acts of the Extraordinary Administrative Radio Conference, Genève, 1951;  

(iv) Special Arrangements Concerning Radio Beacons in the European Zone of Region I, Parijs, 1951.    

(b) Onder voorbehoud van voorafgaande overeenstemming tussen een krijgsmacht en de Duitse autoriteiten nemen de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht eveneens de bepalingen in acht van andere nieuwe internationale overeenkomsten op het gebied van de verreberichtgeving waarbij de Bondsliek geen partij is, voorzover de Bondsrepubliek deze epalingen binnen haar grondgebied toepast. De krijgsmacht brengt geen bezwaren in tegen de toepassing van de bepalingen van overeenkomsten van deze aard, behoudens in geval van dwingende militaire redenen.  

(c) De Duitse autoriteiten houden naar behoren rekening met de behoeften van een krijgsmacht voorzover de Bondsrepubliek binnen haar grondgebied internationale overeenkomsten op het gebied van de verreberichtgeving waarbij zij geen partij is, toepast.  

(d) Het gestelde onder (*a*) tot en met (*c*) is echter slechts van toepassing onder voorwaarde dat een krijgsmacht niet is gebonden aan de bepalingen van de daarbedoelde overeenkomsten voorzover de Duitse strijdkrachten hieraan ingevolge interne Duitse voorschriften niet zijn onderworpen.     

####Ad artikel 63

1.  De regeling neergelegd in artikel 63 sluit de mogelijkheid niet uit dat overeenkomsten worden gesloten inzake financiële vraagstukken tijdens besprekingen of onderhandelingen die voorzien zijn in de Aanvullende Overeenkomst of in het NAVO-Status Verdrag en waarbij financiële vraagstukken een rol spelen.   
2.  Goederen en diensten die ingevolge artikel 63, tweede, derde en vierde lid, onder (*a*) en (*b*), kosteloos door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst gebruikt of aan hen verstrekt worden, kunnen door de krijgsmacht of de civiele dienst officieel ter beschikking worden gesteld aan de gezinsleden van leden van de krijgsmacht of van de civiele dienst op dezelfde wijze als zij officieel aan deze leden zelf ter beschikking kunnen worden gesteld.   
3.  Diensten geleverd door de Duitse strijdkrachten op het gebied van de meteorologie, topografie, en cartografie blijven aan bijzondere regelingen voorbehouden.   
4.  Onder goederen die rechtens eigendom zijn van de Bond of van een Land (rechtlich im Eigentum des Bundes oder eines Landes stehend) worden niet begrepen goederen die het eigendom zijn van andere rechtspersonen zelfs niet indien de aandelen hiervan in handen zijn van de Bond of van een Land.   
5.  De Bondsrepubliek is bereid op grond van bijzondere in individuele gevallen te sluiten overeenkomsten te verzekeren, dat bepaalde goederen in eigendom van rechtspersonen waarvan de aandelen in handen zijn van de Bond of van een Land, voor gebruik ter beschikking worden gesteld aan een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst zonder verplichting hunnerzijds om daarvoor huur of pacht te betalen.   
6.  Goederen als bedoeld in artikel 63, vierde lid, onder (*a*) en (*b*), kunnen door een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst slechts met toestemming van de Duitse autoriteiten aan een andere krijgsmacht of een andere civiele dienst worden overgedragen.   
7.  

(a) Voor het gebruik van goederen die de Bondsrepubliek nade inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst voor andere dan verdedigingsdoeleinden verwerft, wordt, indien zulks tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht is overeengekomen, een vergoeding betaald.  

(b) Voor het gebruik van goederen die een Land na de inwerkingtreding van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst voor andere dan verdedigingsdoeleinden verwerft, wordt, indien zulks tussen de Duitse autoriteiten en de autoriteiten van een krijgsmacht is overeengekomen, de staat van herkomst niet gevrijwaard tegen eventuele vorderingen die het Land heeft ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving uit hoofde van dat gebruik.     
8.  Onder „andere bedrijfskosten” bedoeld in artikel 63, vierde lid, onder (*d*), worden tevens begrepen: 

(a) de kosten voor: 

(i) het reinigen of het met grint of zand bestrooien van wegen, trottoirs en toegangen;  

(ii) de afvoer van afvalwater en vuilnis;  

(iii) de drainering;  

(iv) het vegen van schoorstenen;  

(v) de verplichte verzekering tegen brand en andere schade aan goederen;   voorzover krachtens de Duitse wetgeving een verplichting tot betaling van deze kosten geldt;  

(b) indien van toepassing, de kosten voor: 

(i) de voorziening met elektriciteit, gas, water, verwarng en brandstoffen, hetzij tezamen met de onroerende goederen ter beschikking gesteld, hetzij afzonderlijk rechtstreeks van de daarvoor bestemde openbare diensten betrokken;  

(ii) het gebruik van liften;  

(iii) schoonmaakwerkzaamheden en het bestrijden van ongedierte;  

(iv) het onderhoud van tuinen;  

(v) de indienstneming van een conciërge.       
9.  Aangezien de betaling door een krijgsmacht van lopende openbare lasten op goederen en andere bedrijfskosten in sommige gevallen rechtstreekse betaling aan de leverancier van de betrokken diensten, (waarvan sommige ingevolge de Duitse wetgeving afzonderlijk moeten worden betaald en niet of niet ten volle zijn gedekt door lopende openbare lasten op het onroerende goed) en in andere gevallen, de terugbetaling aan de Bondsrepubliek kan meebrengen, worden overeenkomsten gesloten voorzover zulks noodzakelijk is om te verzekeren dat geen dubbele betaling voor dezelfde dienst wordt verricht.   
10.  De regeling neergelegd in artikel 63, vierde lid, onder (*d*), en in het achtste lid van dit artikel sluit de mogelijkheid niet uit dat besprekingen worden gevoerd tussen de autoriteiten van de krijgsmacht en de plaatselijke Duitse autoriteiten inzake het verkrijgen van ontheffingen van belastingen indien zodanige diensten door de krijgsmacht zelf in plaats van door de bevoegde Duitse diensten worden geleverd.   
11.  De uitdrukking „herstel- en onderhoudskosten” bedoeld in artikel 63, vierde lid, onder (*d*), sub (i), betekent ten aanzien van onroerende goederen, kosten, die uit herstel- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden voortvloeien, bedoeld in artikel 48, vierde lid, en in het zesde lid van het artikel van het Protocol van Ondertekening dat op dat artikel betrekking heeft.   
12.  Schadevergoeding die ingevolge de Wet inzake de verwerving van terreinen (artikel 63, vijfde lid, onder (*a*), sub (i)) moet worden betaald, omvat de betalingen die in het geval van verwerving in het vrije verkeer moeten worden betaald, in het bijzonder de koopprijs en huur- en pachtrenten.   

####Ad artikel 68

1.  

(a) Indien een nieuwe Duitse belasting, die na het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst is ingevoerd en niet uitsluitend een uitbreiding van een bestaande Duitse belasting is, van toepassing is op leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of op gezinsleden, ingevolge de bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst, en volgens de bepalingen van de Duitse belastingwetgeving rechtstreeks door hen moet worden betaald, onderzoekt de Bondsregering op verzoek nauwgezet of en in hoeverre die belasting door de genoemde personen betaald moet worden. De Bondsregering laat zich hierbij in het bijzonder leiden door de overweging, dat vermeden moet worden leden van een krijgsmacht of een civiele dienst of gezinsleden lasten op te leggen, die in het licht van het doel en de bijzondere voorwaarden van hun aanwezigheid in de Bondsrepubliek ongerechtvaardigd schijnen.  

(b) Dezelfde procedure wordt gevolgd, indien een op het tijdstip van het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst bestaande belasting die niet voorkomt op de in het tweede lid van deze afdeling vervatte lijst, ingevolge de bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst van toepassing is op leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of op gezinsleden en volgens de bepalingen van de Duitse belastingwetgeving rechtstreeks door hen moet worden betaald.  

(c) De lijst, vervat in het tweede lid van deze afdeling, behelst een opsomming van alle bestaande Bonds- en Landsbelastingen en alle andere op het tijdstip van het inwerkingtreden van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst aan de Bondsregering bekende belastingen die ingevolge de bepalingen van het NAVO-Status Verdrag en de Aanvullende Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn op leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of op gezinsleden en volgens de bepalingen van de Duitse belastingwetgeving rechtstreeks door hen moeten worden betaald. Deze lijst behelst in het algemeen niet de indirecte belastingen die in de prijs van goederen en diensten tot uitdrukking kunnen komen en waarvan leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of gezinsleden niet zijn vrijgesteld. De in de lijst bij enkele belastingen gegeven toelichtingen geven een korte samenvatting van de omstandigheden waaronder deze belastingen van toepassing zijn.  

(d) Onder de huidige Duitse wetgeving bestaan geen belastingfaciliteiten voor leden van de Duitse krijgsmacht en hun gezinsleden; het ligt evenmin in de bedoeling zodanige faciliteiten in de toekomst te verlenen. Mochten zodanige belastingfaciliteiten evenwel worden verleend, dan zal de Bondsregering er naar streven deze ook van toepassing te doen zijn op leden van de krijgsmachten en van de civiele diensten en op gezinsleden.     
2.   *Lijst van Duitse belastingen*  

(a)  *Belastingen op het inkomen*  Einkommensteuer, Lohnsteuer, Kapitalertragsteuer, Aufsichtsratsteuer, Steuerabzug von Einkünften bei beschränkt Steuerpflichtigen. Belasting wordt slechts geheven op binnenlands inkomen, dat wil in het algemeen zeggen: inkomen verworven binnen de Bondsrepubliek, met uitzondering van salarissen en andere inkomsten die aan de leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst als zodanig betaald worden door de staat van herkomst.  

(b)  *Belastingen op vermogen of bezit*  Vermögensteuer, Grundsteuer, Rentenbankgrundschuldzinsen, Kirchensteuer. Belasting wordt slechts geheven op binnenlands vermogen, dat wil in het algemeen zeggen: vermogen dat zich binnen de Bondsrepubliek bevindt, met uitzondering van roerende goederen die zich slechts in de Bondsrepubliek bevinden omdat het lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of het gezinslid tijdelijk in de Bondsrepubliek verblijft.  

(c)  *Successie- en schenkingsrechten*  Erbschaftsteuer. Het recht wordt slechts geheven op binnenlands vermogen (in de zin van het bepaalde onder (*b*)), met uitzondering van roerende goederen die zich slechts in de Bondsrepubliek bevinden omdat het lid van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst of het gezinslid tijdelijk in de Bondsrepubliek verblijft, of van de waarde van het vruchtgebruik van zodanige vermogens die door vererving of schenking verkregen worden. Indien de overledene op het tijdstip van zijn overlijden, of de schenker op het tijdstip van de schenking, zijn woonplaats of gewoon verblijf (in de zin van de belastingwetten) in de Bondsrepubliek had, wordt het recht geheven op basis van de totale waarde van de erfenis of schenking.  

(d)  *Verkeers- en kapitaalverkeersbelastingen*  Kapitalverkehrsteuern, Wechselsteuer, Beförderungsteuer, Versicherungsteuer, Grunderwerbsteuer (und Überpreis), Wertzuwachssteuer, Kraftfahrzeugsteuer. Wat de verzekeringsbelasting betreft, worden die verzekeraars en gemachtigde vertegenwoordigers beschouwd als binnenlandse verzekeraars en gemachtigde op het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek gevestigde vertegenwoordigers in de zin van artikel 68, tweede lid, die hun woonplaats, zetel of hoofdzetel binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek hebben. De motorrijtuigenbelasting op particuliere personenrijtuigen wordt slechts geheven van motorrijtuigen die van een Duits registratienummer zijn voorzien.  

(e)  *Heffingen in het kader van de „egalisatie van lasten”*  Lastenausgleichsabgaben.  

(f)  *Belastingen op jacht en visserij*  Jagdsteuer, Fischsteuer.  

(g)  *Bedrijfsbelastingen*  Gewerbesteuer, Umsatzsteuer, Schankerlaubnissteuer, Getränkesteuer en andere belastingen die op ondernemingen van toepassing kunnen zijn. De belastingen worden geheven indien leden van een krijgsmacht of van een civiele dienst, naast hun werkzaamheden als lid van een krijgsmacht of civiele dienst, binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek optreden als ondernemer. Het begrip „ondernemer” („Unternehmer”) omvat de zelfstandige uitoefening van beroeps- of bedrijfswerkzaamheden, dat wil zeggen: iedere voortdurende werkzaamheid die er op gericht is inkomsten (Einnahmen) te verkrijgen, ook indien het oogmerk om winst te behalen ontbreekt. Het begrip „omzet” (Umsatz) omvat leveranties en diensten die een ondernemer binnen het grondgebied van de Bondsrepubliek in het kader van zijn onderneming tegen betaling uitvoert.     

####Ad artikel 71

1.  Tenzij met de Duitse autoriteiten anders is overeengekomen, mag het totaal aantal burgerwerknemers in de zin van artikel 56 van de Aanvullende Overeenkomst die bij het inwerkingtreden van die Overeenkomst doorlopend in dienst zijn in verkoopmagazijnen en clubs ten dienste van een krijgsmacht, met niet meer dan 25% verhoogd worden.
