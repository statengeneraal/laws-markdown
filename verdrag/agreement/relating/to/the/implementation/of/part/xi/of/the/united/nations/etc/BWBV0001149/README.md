### Bijlage  

### Titel  1  

####Kosten voor de Saten die partij zijn en institutionele regelingen

### 1  

De Internationale Zeebodemautoriteit (hierna te noemen „de Autoriteit") is de organisatie door middel waarvan de Staten die Partij zijn bij het Verdrag, in overeenstemming met de in Deel XI en in deze Overeenkomst vastgestelde regeling voor het gebied, de werkzaamheden in het Gebied organiseren en er toezicht op uitoefenen, vooral ten einde de rijkdommen van het Gebied te beheren. De bevoegdheden en functies van de Autoriteit zijn die welke uitdrukkelijk aan haar zijn toegekend door het Verdrag. De Autoriteit bezit de nadere bevoegdheden, verenigbaar met het Verdrag, die haar stilzwijgend zijn toegekend en noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitoefening van deze bevoegdheden en functies ten aanzien van werkzaamheden in het Gebied.  

### 2  

Ten einde de kosten voor de Staten die Partij zijn tot een minimum te beperken, moeten alle ingevolge het Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst in te stellen organen en ondergeschikte lichamen kostenbesparend te werk gaan. Dit beginsel geldt ook voor de frequentie, de duur en het rooster van vergaderingen.  

### 3  

De instelling en de functionering van de organen en ondergeschikte lichamen van de Autoriteit dienen te zijn gebaseerd op een geleidelijke verwezenlijking, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de functionele behoeften van de betrokken organen en ondergeschikte lichamen opdat deze zich doeltreffend kunnen kwijten van hun onderscheiden verantwoordelijkheden in de diverse ontwikkelingsfasen van de werkzaamheden in het Gebied.  

### 4  

De eerste functies van de Autoriteit bij de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag worden verricht door de Vergadering, de Raad, het Secretariaat, de Juridische en Technische Commissie en de Financiële Commissie. De functies van de Commissie voor Economische Planning worden verricht door de Juridische en Technische Commissie totdat de Raad anders besluit of tot de goedkeuring van het eerste werkplan voor exploitatie.  

### 5  

In de tijd tussen de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag en de goedkeuring van het eerste werkplan voor exploitatie richt de Autoriteit zich op: 

a. Het behandelen van aanvragen om goedkeuring van werkplannen voor exploratie in overeenstemming met Deel XI en deze Overeenkomst;  

b. Het uitvoeren van besluiten van de Voorbereidende Commissie voor de Internationale Zeebodemautoriteit en voor het Internationale Hof voor het Recht van de Zee (hierna te noemen „de Voorbereidende Commissie"), betreffende geregistreerde pionier-investeerders en de Staten die voor hen borg staan, met inbegrip van hun rechten en verplichtingen, in overeenstemming met artikel 308, vijfde lid, van het Verdrag en resolutie II, paragraaf 13;  

c. Het toezien op de naleving van werkplannen voor exploratie die in de vorm van een contract zijn goedgekeurd;  

d. Het volgen en bestuderen van trends en ontwikkelingen met betrekking tot diepzeemijnbouw, met inbegrip van een regelmatige analyse van de situatie op de wereldmarkt voor metaal en van de metaalprijzen, trends en vooruitzichten;  

e. Het onderzoeken van de potentiële invloed van de winning van delfstoffen uit het Gebied op de economieën van ontwikkelingslanden die deze delfstoffen uit mijnen op het land winnen, en die waarschijnlijk het ernstigst zullen worden getroffen, ten einde hun moeilijkheden tot een minimum te beperken en hen bij te staan in de aanpassing van hun economie, met inachtneming van het in dezen door de Voorbereidende Commissie verrichte werk;  

f. Het aannemen van regels, voorschriften en procedures die nodig zijn voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, naarmate deze werkzaamheden voortschrijden. Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in Bijlage III, artikel 17, tweede lid, letter b en c, van het Verdrag wordt in deze regels, voorschriften en procedures rekening gehouden met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, het langdurige uitstel van de commerciële diepzeemijnbouw en het vermoedelijke tempo van werkzaamheden in het Gebied;  

g. Het aannemen van regels, voorschriften en procedures die toepasselijke normen behelzen voor de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu; h. Het bevorderen en aanmoedigen van het verrichten van wetenschappelijk zeeonderzoek met betrekking tot werkzaamheden in het Gebied en het vergaren en verspreiden van de resultaten van onderzoek en analyse, wanneer deze beschikbaar zijn, waarbij in het bijzonder de nadruk wordt gelegd op onderzoek naar de milieu-effecten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied;  

i. Het verwerven van wetenschappelijke kennis en volgen van de ontwikkeling van voor werkzaamheden in het Gebied relevante mariene technologie, met name technologie voor de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu;  

j. Het evalueren van beschikbare gegevens betreffende prospectie en exploratie;  

k. Het tijdig opstellen van regels, voorschriften en procedures voor exploitatie, met inbegrip van regels, voorschriften en procedures betreffende de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu.    

### 6  

a).  Een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie wordt door de Raad bestudeerd na ontvangst van een aanbeveling inzake de aanvraag van de Juridische en Technische Commissie. De behandeling van een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie geschiedt in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, met inbegrip van zijn Bijlage III, en deze Overeenkomst en met inachtneming van het onderstaande: 

i. Een werkplan voor exploratie ingediend namens een Staat of lichaam of een onderdeel van een dergelijk lichaam, bedoeld in resolutie II, paragraaf 1, letter a, onder ii of iii, niet zijnde een geregistreerde pionier-investeerder, die c.q. dat reeds omvangrijke werkzaamheden in het Gebied had verricht voor de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag, of diens rechtsopvolger, wordt geacht te hebben voldaan aan de voor de goedkeuring van een werkplan vereiste financiële en technische voorwaarden indien de Staat of Staten die borg staat/staan, verklaart/verklaren dat de aanvrager een bedrag gelijk aan ten minste US$30 miljoen heeft uitgegeven aan onderzoeks- en exploratiewerkzaamheden en niet minder dan 10 procent van dat bedrag heeft uitgegeven aan de plaatsbepaling, plaatsbeschrijving en evaluatie van het in het werkplan bedoelde gebied. Indien het werkplan anderszins voldoet aan de vereisten van het Verdrag en van ingevolge het Verdrag aangenomen regels, voorschriften en procedures, wordt het door de Raad goedgekeurd in de vorm van een contract. De bepalingen van titel 3, paragraaf 11, van deze Bijlage worden dienovereenkomstig uitgelegd en toegepast;  

ii. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van resolutie II, paragraaf 8, letter a, kan een geregistreerde pionier-investeerder binnen 36 maanden na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag verzoeken om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie. Het werkplan voor exploratie dient te bestaan uit bescheiden, rapporten en andere gegevens die zowel voor als na de registratie zijn voorgelegd aan de Voorbereidende Commissie en gaat vergezeld van een verklaring van naleving, bestaande uit een feitelijk verslag omtrent de nakoming van verplichtingen uit hoofde van de regeling inzake pionier-investeerders, die is afgegeven door de Voorbereidende Commissie in overeenstemming met resolutie II, paragraaf 11, letter a. Dit werkplan wordt geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Dit goedgekeurde werkplan wordt gegoten in de vorm van een contract gesloten tussen de Autoriteit en de geregistreerde pionier-investeerder in overeenstemming met Deel XI en deze Overeenkomst. De ingevolge resolutie II, paragraaf 7, letter a, betaalde heffing van US$250.000 wordt beschouwd als de heffing betreffende de exploratiefase ingevolge titel 8, paragraaf 3, van deze Bijlage. Titel 3, paragraaf 11, van deze Bijlage wordt dienovereenkomstig uitgelegd en toegepast;  

iii. In overeenstemming met het beginsel van non-discriminatie omvat een contract met een Staat of lichaam of onderdeel van een dergelijk lichaam bedoeld in letter a, onder i, regelingen die vergelijkbaar zijn met en niet minder gunstig dan die overeengekomen met een geregistreerde pionier-investeerder bedoeld in letter a, onder ii. Indien Staten of lichamen of onderdelen van zodanige lichamen bedoeld in letter a, onder i, gunstiger regelingen worden toegekend, treft de Raad vergelijkbare en niet minder gunstige regelingen met betrekking tot de door de pionier-investeerders bedoeld in letter a, onder ii, op zich genomen rechten en verplichtingen, mits deze regelingen de belangen van de Autoriteit niet raken of schaden;  

iv. Een Staat die borg staat voor een aanvrage van een werkplan ingevolge de bepalingen van letter a, onder i of ii, kan zijn een Staat die Partij is of een Staat die deze Overeenkomst voorlopig toepast in overeenstemming met artikel 7, dan wel een Staat die in overeenstemming met paragraaf 12 voorlopig lid van de Autoriteit is;  

v. Resolutie II, paragraaf 8, letter c, wordt uitgelegd en toegepast in overeenstemming met letter a, onder iv.     
b).  De goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie geschiedt in overeenstemming met artikel 153, derde lid, van het Verdrag.   

### 7  

Een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan dient vergezeld te gaan van een evaluatie van de potentiële milieu-effecten van de voorgestelde werkzaamheden en van een beschrijving van een programma voor oceanografisch en ecologisch onderzoek in overeenstemming met de regels, voorschriften en procedures aangenomen door de Autoriteit.  

### 8  

Onder voorbehoud van paragraaf 6, letter a, onder i of ii, wordt een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie behandeld in overeenstemming met de procedures neergelegd in titel 3, paragraaf 11, van deze Bijlage.  

### 9  

Een werkplan voor exploratie wordt goedgekeurd voor een tijdvak van 15 jaar. Na het verstrijken van de termijn van een werkplan voor exploratie vraagt de contractant een werkplan voor exploitatie aan, tenzij de contractant dat reeds heeft gedaan of een verlenging van het werkplan voor exploratie heeft verkregen. Contractanten kunnen zulke verlengingen aanvragen voor tijdvakken van niet langer dan telkens vijf jaar. Deze verlengingen worden goedgekeurd indien de contractant te goeder trouw heeft gepoogd om te voldoen aan de vereisten van het werkplan, maar om redenen buiten zijn macht niet in staat is geweest het noodzakelijke voorbereidende werk voor de overgang naar de exploitatiefase te voltooien, of indien de heersende economische situatie het overgaan tot de exploitatiefase niet rechtvaardigt.  

### 10  

Aanwijzing van een voor de Autoriteit gereserveerd gebied in overeenstemming met Bijlage III, artikel 8, van het Verdrag, vindt plaats bij de goedkeuring van een aanvraag van een werkplan voor exploratie of goedkeuring van een aanvraag voor een werkplan voor exploratie en exploitatie.  

### 11  

Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van paragraaf 9 eindigt een goedgekeurd werkplan voor exploratie waarvoor ten minste een Staat die deze Overeenkomst voorlopig toepast, borg staat, indien deze Staat ophoudt deze Overeenkomst voorlopig toe te passen en geen voorlopig lid is geworden in overeenstemming met paragraaf 12 of indien deze Staat geen Partij is geworden.  

### 12  

Bij inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst kunnen Staten en de in artikel 3 van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde lichamen die in overeenstemming met artikel 7 de Overeenkomst voorlopig hebben toegepast en waarvoor zij niet in werking is getreden, voorlopig lid van de Autoriteit blijven, in afwachting van de inwerkingtreding van de Overeenkomst voor deze Staten en lichamen, en wel in overeenstemming met de onderstaande bepalingen: 

a. Indien deze Overeenkomst in werking treedt voor 16 november 1996 zijn deze Staten en lichamen gerechtigd voorlopig te blijven deelnemen als lid van de Autoriteit wanneer zij de depositaris van de Overeenkomst mededelen dat zij voornemens zijn als voorlopig lid deel te nemen. Dit lidmaatschap eindigt hetzij op 16 november 1996, hetzij bij de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst en het Verdrag voor dat lid, naar gelang welk van deze tijdstippen eerder valt. Op verzoek van de betrokken Staat of het betrokken lichaam kan de Raad dit lidmaatschap verlengen na 16 november 1996 voor een tijdvak of tijdvakken van in totaal niet langer dan twee jaar, mits de Raad ervan overtuigd is dat de betrokken Staat of het betrokken lichaam te goeder trouw heeft gepoogd partij bij de Overeenkomst en het Verdrag te worden;  

b. Indien deze Overeenkomst in werking treedt na 15 november 1996 kunnen deze Staten en lichamen de Raad verzoeken toe te staan dat zij voorlopig lid van de Autoriteit blijven voor een tijdvak of tijdvakken tot uiterlijk 16 november 1998. De Raad staat dit lidmaatschap toe met ingang van de datum van het verzoek indien hij ervan overtuigd is dat de Staat of het lichaam te goeder trouw heeft gepoogd partij bij de Overeenkomst en het Verdrag te worden;  

c. Staten en lichamen die in overeenstemming met letter a of b voorlopig lid van de Autoriteit zijn, passen de bepalingen van Deel XI en deze Overeenkomst toe in overeenstemming met hun nationale of interne wetten, voorschriften en jaarlijkse begrotingstoewijzingen en hebben dezelfde rechten en verplichtingen als andere leden, met inbegrip van: 

i. De verplichting bij te dragen aan de administratieve begroting van de Autoriteit in overeenstemming met de overeengekomen contributieschaal;  

ii. Het recht borg te staan voor een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploratie. In het geval van lichamen waarvan de onderdelen natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zijn die de nationaliteit van meer dan een Staat bezitten, wordt een werkplan voor exploratie slechts goedgekeurd indien alle Staten waarvan de natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die lichamen vormen, Staten zijn die Partij zijn of voorlopig lid zijn;    

d. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van paragraaf 9 eindigt een goedgekeurd werkplan in de vorm van een contract voor exploratie waarvoor ingevolge letter c, onder ii, een Staat die voorlopig lid was, borg stond, indien dit lidmaatschap eindigt en de Staat of het lichaam geen Partij is geworden;  

e. Indien dit lid heeft nagelaten zijn bijdragen te voldoen of anderszins in gebreke is gebleven zijn verplichtingen na te komen in overeenstemming met deze paragraaf, wordt zijn voorlopig lidmaatschap beëindigd.    

### 13  

De verwijzing in Bijlage III, artikel 10, van het Verdrag naar een prestatie die niet bevredigend is geweest, wordt zo uitgelegd dat hieronder wordt verstaan dat de contractant niet heeft voldaan aan de vereisten van een goedgekeurd werkplan ondanks een schriftelijke aanmaning of aanmaningen van de Autoriteit aan de contractant dienaangaande.  

### 14  

De Autoriteit heeft haar eigen begroting. Tot het einde van het jaar volgend op het jaar waarin deze Overeenkomst in werking treedt, worden de administratieve uitgaven van de Autoriteit gedekt uit de begroting van de Verenigde Naties. Daarna worden de administratieve uitgaven van de Autoriteit gedekt uit de bijdragen van haar leden, met inbegrip van voorlopige leden, in overeenstemming met artikel 171, letter a, en artikel 173 van het Verdrag en deze Overeenkomst, totdat de Autoriteit voldoende middelen uit andere bronnen heeft om deze uitgaven te dekken. De Autoriteit mag de in artikel 174, eerste lid, van het Verdrag bedoelde bevoegdheid om leningen aan te gaan ter financiering van haar administratieve begroting niet uitoefenen.  

### 15  

In overeenstemming met artikel 162, tweede lid, letter o, onder ii, van het Verdrag gaat de Autoriteit over tot uitwerking en aanneming van regels, voorschriften en procedures, die zijn gebaseerd op de beginselen neergelegd in de titels 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 van deze Bijlage, alsook van bijkomende regels, voorschriften en procedures nodig ter vergemakkelijking van de goedkeuring van werkplannen voor exploratie of exploitatie, en wel in overeenstemming met de onderstaande bepalingen: 

a. De Raad kan tot deze uitwerking overgaan telkens wanneer hij van oordeel is dat deze regels, voorschriften of procedures vereist zijn voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, of wanneer hij vaststelt dat de commerciële exploitatie binnenkort zal aanvangen, dan wel op verzoek van een Staat wiens onderdaan voornemens is goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploitatie aan te vragen;  

b. Indien het verzoek wordt gedaan door een in letter a bedoelde Staat, voltooit de Raad, in overeenstemming met artikel 162, tweede lid, letter o, van het Verdrag, de aanneming van deze regels, voorschriften en procedures binnen twee jaar nadat het verzoek is gedaan;  

c. Indien de Raad de uitwerking van de regels, voorschriften en procedures betreffende exploitatie niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn heeft voltooid en een aanvraag om goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploitatie aanhangig is, dient de Raad niettemin dit werkplan te bestuderen en voorlopig goed te keuren op basis van de bepalingen van het Verdrag en van voorlopig door de Raad aangenomen regels, voorschriften en procedures, dan wel op basis van de in het Verdrag neergelegde normen en de in deze Bijlage neergelegde voorwaarden en beginselen, alsmede het beginsel van non-discriminatie tussen contractanten.    

### 16  

Bij de aanneming van regels, voorschriften en procedures in overeenstemming met Deel XI en deze Overeenkomst houdt de Autoriteit rekening met de ontwerp-regels, -voorschriften en -procedures en de aanbevelingen betreffende de bepalingen van Deel XI, als neergelegd in de rapporten en aanbevelingen van de Voorbereidende Commissie.  

### 17  

De desbetreffende bepalingen van Deel XI, afdeling 4, van het Verdrag worden uitgelegd en toegepast in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst.  

### Titel  2  

####De onderneming

### 1  

Het Secretariaat van de Autoriteit verricht de taken van de Onderneming totdat deze onafhankelijk van het Secretariaat begint te functioneren. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Autoriteit benoemt uit het personeel van de Autoriteit een Directeur-Generaal ad interim die toeziet op het verrichten van deze taken door het Secretariaat. Deze taken zijn: 

a. Het volgen en bezien van trends en ontwikkelingen betreffende diepzeemijnbouw, met inbegrip van een regelmatige analyse van de situatie van de wereldmarkt voor metaal en van metaalprijzen, trends en vooruitzichten;  

b. Het beoordelen van de resultaten van het wetenschappelijk zeeonderzoek met betrekking tot werkzaamheden in het Gebied, waarbij met name de nadruk ligt op onderzoek betreffende de milieu-effecten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied;  

c. Het beoordelen van beschikbare gegevens betreffende prospectie en exploratie, met inbegrip van de criteria voor deze werkzaamheden;  

d. Het beoordelen van technologische ontwikkelingen die van belang zijn voor werkzaamheden in het Gebied, met name technologie verband houdend met de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu;  

e. Het evalueren van informatie en gegevens betreffende de voor de Autoriteit gereserveerde gebieden;  

f. Het beoordelen van de aanpak met betrekking tot joint ventures;  

g. Het vergaren van informatie over de beschikbaarheid van geschoolde arbeidskrachten;  

h. Het bestuderen van mogelijke beleidslijnen met betrekking tot het beheer van de Onderneming in de verschillende fasen van haar werkzaamheden.    

### 2  

De Onderneming verricht haar aanvankelijke werkzaamheden in de diepzeemijnbouw door middel van joint ventures. Na goedkeuring van een werkplan voor exploitatie voor een ander lichaam dan de Onderneming, of na ontvangst door de Raad van een aanvraag voor het opzetten van een joint venture met de Onderneming, bespreekt de Raad de kwestie van het functioneren van de Onderneming onafhankelijk van het Secretariaat van de Autoriteit. Indien joint ventures met de Onderneming in overeenstemming zijn met deugdelijke commerciële beginselen, vaardigt de Raad een richtlijn uit ingevolge artikel 170, tweede lid, van het Verdrag die dit onafhankelijk functioneren mogelijk maakt.  

### 3  

De verplichting van Staten die Partij zijn om de financiële middelen te verstrekken voor een mijngebied van de Onderneming, zoals bepaald in Bijlage IV, artikel 11, derde lid, van het Verdrag, is niet van toepassing en de Staten die Partij zijn, zijn niet verplicht tot financiering van werkzaamheden in een mijngebied van de Onderneming of ingevolge haar joint-venture-regelingen.  

### 4  

De voor contractanten geldende verplichtingen zijn van toepassing op de Onderneming. Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 153, derde lid, en Bijlage III, artikel 3, vijfde lid, van het Verdrag wordt een werkplan voor de Onderneming na goedkeuring gegoten in de vorm van een contract dat wordt gesloten tussen de Autoriteit en de Onderneming.  

### 5  

Een contractant die een bepaald gebied aan de Autoriteit heeft overgedragen als gereserveerd gebied, heeft een voorkeursrecht om een joint venture aan te gaan met de Onderneming voor de exploratie en exploitatie van dat gebied. Indien de Onderneming niet binnen 15 jaar na de aanvang van haar taken onafhankelijk van het Secretariaat van de Autoriteit of binnen 15 jaar na de datum waarop dat gebied voor de Autoriteit wordt gereserveerd, al naar gelang welk tijdstip het laatst valt, een aanvraag voor een werkplan voor werkzaamheden met betrekking tot zulk een gereserveerd gebied indient, is de contractant die het gebied heeft bijgedragen gerechtigd een werkplan voor dat gebied aan te vragen, mits hij te goeder trouw aanbiedt de Onderneming als partner in de joint venture op te nemen.  

### 6  

Artikel 170, vierde lid, Bijlage IV en andere bepalingen van het Verdrag betreffende de Onderneming worden uitgelegd en toegepast in overeenstemming met deze titel.  

### Titel  3  

####Besluitvorming

### 1  

Het algemene beleid van de Autoriteit wordt bepaald door de Vergadering in samenwerking met de Raad.  

### 2  

Als algemene regel geldt dat de organen van de Autoriteit door middel van consensus hun besluiten nemen.  

### 3  

Indien alle middelen om bij consensus tot een besluit te komen zijn uitgeput, worden in de Vergadering in stemming gebrachte besluiten omtrent procedurele aangelegenheden genomen met een meerderheid van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen, en worden besluiten omtrent inhoudelijke zaken genomen met een meerderheid van tweederde van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen, zoals bepaald in artikel 159, achtste lid, van het Verdrag.  

### 4  

Besluiten van de Vergadering omtrent aangelegenheden waarvoor de Raad ook bevoegd is of omtrent administratieve, budgettaire of financiële aangelegenheden dienen te zijn gebaseerd op de aanbevelingen van de Raad. Indien de Vergadering de aanbeveling van de Raad betreffende een aangelegenheid niet aanvaardt, verwijst zij de aangelegenheid terug naar de Raad voor nadere overweging. De Raad beziet de aangelegenheid opnieuw in het licht van de door de Vergadering naar voren gebrachte opvattingen.  

### 5  

Indien alle pogingen om een besluit bij consensus te nemen zijn mislukt, worden in de Raad in stemming gebrachte besluiten omtrent procedurele aangelegenheden genomen met een meerderheid van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen, en worden besluiten omtrent inhoudelijke zaken, behalve wanneer het Verdrag voorziet in besluiten bij consensus in de Raad, genomen met een meerderheid van tweederde van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen, mits tegen deze besluiten geen bezwaar wordt gemaakt door een meerderheid in een van de kamers bedoeld in paragraaf 9. Bij het nemen van besluiten streeft de Raad ernaar de belangen van alle leden van de Autoriteit te bevorderen.  

### 6  

De Raad kan het nemen van een besluit uitstellen ten einde verdere onderhandelingen te vergemakkelijken, wanneer blijkt dat nog niet alle pogingen om consensus omtrent een aangelegenheid te bereiken, zijn mislukt.  

### 7  

Besluiten van de Vergadering of de Raad die financiële of budgettaire gevolgen hebben, dienen te zijn gebaseerd op de aanbevelingen van de Financiële Commissie.  

### 8  

De bepalingen van artikel 161, achtste lid, letters b en c, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.  

### 9  

a).  Elke ingevolge paragraaf 15, letters a tot en met c, gekozen groep Staten wordt voor het stemmen in de Raad als kamer beschouwd. De ingevolge paragraaf 15, letters d en e, gekozen ontwikkelingsstaten worden voor het stemmen in de Raad als één kamer beschouwd.   
b).  Alvorens de leden van de Raad te kiezen, stelt de Vergadering lijsten op van landen die voldoen aan de criteria voor lidmaatschap van groepen Staten in paragraaf 15, letters a tot en met d. Indien een Staat voldoet aan de criteria voor lidmaatschap van meer dan een groep, kan deze slechts door een groep voor verkiezing in de Raad worden voorgedragen en vertegenwoordigt die Staat slechts die groep bij het stemmen in de Raad.   

### 10  

Elke groep Staten bedoeld in paragraaf 15, letters a tot en met d, wordt in de Raad vertegenwoordigd door de door die groep voorgedragen leden. Elke groep draagt slechts zoveel kandidaten voor als er zetels zijn die door die groep moeten worden bezet. Wanneer het aantal potentiële kandidaten in elk van de in paragraaf 15, letters a tot en met e, bedoelde groep groter is dan het voor elk van die groepen beschikbare aantal zetels, geldt in het algemeen het roulatiebeginsel. De Staten die lid zijn van deze groepen bepalen hoe dit beginsel in die groepen wordt toegepast.  

### 11  

a).  De Raad keurt een aanbeveling van de Juridische en Technische Commissie tot goedkeuring van een werkplan goed, tenzij hij, met een meerderheid van tweederde van zijn aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen, met inbegrip van een meerderheid van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen in elk van de kamers van de Raad, besluit een werkplan af te keuren. Indien de Raad niet binnen een voorgeschreven termijn een besluit omtrent een aanbeveling tot goedkeuring van een werkplan neemt, wordt de aanbeveling geacht door de Raad te zijn goedgekeurd aan het einde van die termijn. De voorgeschreven termijn is gewoonlijk 60 dagen, tenzij de Raad een langere termijn bepaalt. Indien de Commissie de afkeuring van een werkplan aanbeveelt, of geen aanbeveling doet, kan de Raad het werkplan niettemin goedkeuren in overeenstemming met zijn reglement van orde betreffende de besluitvorming omtrent inhoudelijke zaken.   
b).  De bepalingen van artikel 162, tweede lid, letter j, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.   

### 12  

Wanneer er een geschil rijst met betrekking tot de afkeuring van een werkplan, wordt dit geregeld volgens de in het Verdrag neergelegde procedures voor de regeling van geschillen.  

### 13  

Besluiten die in de Juridische en Technische Commissie in stemming worden gebracht, worden genomen met een meerderheid van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen.  

### 14  

Deel XI, afdeling 4, onderafdelingen B en C van het Verdrag worden uitgelegd en toegepast in overeenstemming met deze titel.  

### 15  

De Raad bestaat uit 36 leden van de Autoriteit, die door de Vergadering worden gekozen in de onderstaande volgorde: 

a. Vier leden uit de Staten die Partij zijn die, gedurende de laatste vijf jaar waarvoor statistieken beschikbaar zijn, hetzij in waarde uitgedrukt meer dan 2 procent van het totale wereldverbruik hebben verbruikt, hetzij in waarde uitgedrukt een netto invoer hebben gehad van meer dan 2 procent van de totale wereldinvoer van de grondstoffen, geproduceerd uit de categorieën delfstoffen die in het Gebied zullen worden gewonnen, met dien verstande dat onder deze vier leden zich een Staat uit de Oosteuropese regio dient te bevinden, die de grootste economie in die regio, uitgedrukt in bruto binnenlands produkt, heeft, alsmede de Staat die op de datum van inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag de grootste economie, uitgedrukt in bruto binnenlands produkt, heeft, indien deze Staten in deze groep vertegenwoordigd wensen te zijn;  

b. Vier leden uit de acht Staten die Partij zijn die de grootste investeringen hebben gedaan in de voorbereiding en het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, hetzij direct, hetzij via hun onderdanen;  

c. Vier leden uit de Staten die Partij zijn die op basis van de produktie in onder hun rechtsmacht vallende gebieden grote netto exporteurs zijn van de categorieën delfstoffen die in het Gebied zullen worden gewonnen, waaronder ten minste twee ontwikkelingsstaten wier exporten van zulke delfstoffen van aanzienlijk belang zijn voor hun economie;  

d. Zes leden uit de ontwikkelingsstaten die Partij zijn, die bijzondere belangen vertegenwoordigen. De te vertegenwoordigen bijzondere belangen omvatten die van Staten met een grote bevolking, Staten zonder zeekust of Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging, eiland-staten, Staten die grote importeurs zijn van de categorieën delfstoffen die uit het Gebied zullen worden gewonnen, Staten die potentiële producenten van zulke delfstoffen zijn, en minst ontwikkelde Staten;  

e. Achttien leden, gekozen volgens het beginsel dat een billijke geografische verdeling van zetels in de Raad als geheel moet worden verzekerd, met dien verstande dat per geografische regio ten minste een lid wordt gekozen op grond van deze letter. Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling zijn de geografische regio's: Afrika, Azië, Oost-Europa, Latijns-Amerika en het Caribisch gebied, alsmede West-Europa en andere Staten.    

### 16  

De bepalingen van artikel 161, eerste lid, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.  

### Titel  4  

####Herzieningsconferentie

De bepalingen betreffende de Herzieningsconferentie in artikel 155, eerste, derde en vierde lid, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 314, tweede lid, van het Verdrag kan de Vergadering op aanbeveling van de Raad te allen tijde de aangelegenheden bedoeld in artikel 155, eerste lid, van het Verdrag bezien. Wijzigingen met betrekking tot deze Overeenkomst en Deel XI zijn onderworpen aan de procedures neergelegd in de artikelen 314, 315 en 316 van het Verdrag, met dien verstande dat de beginselen, de regeling en andere voorwaarden bedoeld in artikel 155, tweede lid, van het Verdrag worden gehandhaafd en dat de rechten bedoeld in het vijfde lid van dat artikel niet worden aangetast.    
### Titel  5  

####Overdracht van technologie

### 1  

Voor de toepassing van Deel XI gelden voor de overdracht van technologie, naast de bepalingen van artikel 144 van het Verdrag, de onderstaande beginselen: 

a. De Onderneming en de ontwikkelingsstaten die technologie voor diepzeemijnbouw wensen te verwerven, streven ernaar deze technologie op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden te verwerven op de vrije markt, of via joint ventures;  

b. Indien de Onderneming of de ontwikkelingsstaten niet in staat zijn technologie voor diepzeemijnbouw te verwerven, kan de Autoriteit alle of enkele van de contractanten en de Staat of Staten die onderscheidenlijk voor hun borg staat of staan, verzoeken met haar samen te werken bij de vergemakkelijking van de verwerving van technologie voor diepzeemijnbouw door de Onderneming of haar joint venture, of door een ontwikkelingsstaat of ontwikkelingsstaten die deze technologie wenst of wensen te verwerven op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden, op een wijze die verenigbaar is met de doeltreffende bescherming van de intellectuele eigendom. De Staten die Partij zijn verplichten zich ertoe ter zake volledig en doeltreffend samen te werken met de Autoriteit en erop toe te zien dat de contractanten waarvoor zij borg staan ook volledig met de Autoriteit samenwerken;  

c. Als algemene regel bevorderen de Staten die Partij zijn de internationale technische en wetenschappelijke samenwerking met betrekking tot werkzaamheden in het Gebied, hetzij tussen de betrokken partijen hetzij door het opzetten van programma's voor opleiding, technische bijstand en wetenschappelijke samenwerking op het gebied van de mariene wetenschappen en technologie en de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu.    

### 2  

De bepalingen van Bijlage III, artikel 5, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.  

### Titel  6  

####Produktiebeleid

### 1  

Het produktiebeleid van de Autoriteit is gebaseerd op de volgende beginselen: 

a. Ontwikkeling van de rijkdommen van het Gebied geschiedt in overeenstemming met deugdelijke commerciële beginselen;  

b. De bepalingen van de Algemene Overeenkomst inzake Tarieven en Handel, de desbetreffende codes en de verdragen die deze opvolgen of vervangen, zijn van toepassing met betrekking tot werkzaamheden in het Gebied;  

c. Met name worden werkzaamheden in het Gebied niet gesubsidieerd, behalve voor zover toegestaan ingevolge de overeenkomsten bedoeld in letter b. Subsidiëring wordt voor de toepassing van deze beginselen gedefinieerd als in de overeenkomsten bedoeld in letter b;  

d. Er wordt geen onderscheid gemaakt tussen delfstoffen uit het Gebied en uit andere bronnen. Er bestaat geen preferentiële toegang tot de markt voor deze delfstoffen of voor importen van uit deze delfstoffen geproduceerde grondstoffen, met name: 

i. door het hanteren van tarifaire en non-tarifaire belemmeringen; en  

ii. verleend door Staten die Partij zijn, aan zodanige delfstoffen of grondstoffen geproduceerd door hun staatsondernemingen of door natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die hun nationaliteit bezitten of die staan onder hun zeggenschap of die van hun onderdanen;    

e. Het door de Autoriteit voor elk mijngebied goedgekeurde werkplan voor exploitatie omvat een produktieschema met de geraamde maximumhoeveelheden delfstoffen die per jaar ingevolge het werkplan zouden worden geproduceerd;  

f. Het onderstaande geldt voor de regeling van geschillen betreffende de bepalingen van de in letter b bedoelde verdragen: 

i. Wanneer de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, partij zijn bij zulke verdragen, maken zij gebruik van de procedures voor de regeling van geschillen van die verdragen;  

ii. Wanneer een of meer van de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, geen partij zijn bij zulke verdragen, maken zij gebruik van de procedures voor de regeling van geschillen neergelegd in het Verdrag;    

g. In omstandigheden waarin ingevolge de in letter b bedoelde verdragen wordt vastgesteld dat een Staat die Partij is zich heeft beziggehouden met subsidiëring die is verboden of heeft geleid tot nadelige gevolgen voor de belangen van een andere Staat die Partij is, en door de desbetreffende Staat die Partij is of Staten die Partij zijn geen passende stappen zijn ondernomen, kan een Staat die Partij is de Raad verzoeken passende maatregelen te nemen.    

### 2  

De beginselen vervat in het eerste lid zijn niet van invloed op de rechten en verplichtingen krachtens een bepaling van de in het eerste lid, letter b, bedoelde verdragen, alsmede de desbetreffende vrijhandels- en douane-unie-verdragen, in de betrekkingen tussen Staten die Partij zijn, die partij bij zulke verdragen zijn.  

### 3  

De aanvaarding door een contractant van andere subsidies dan die welke zijn toegestaan ingevolge de in het eerste lid, letter b, bedoelde verdragen, vormt een schending van de fundamentele voorwaarden van het contract dat een werkplan vormt voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied.  

### 4  

Een Staat die Partij is die redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat er sprake is van schending van de in het eerste lid, letters b tot en met d, of het derde lid, genoemde voorwaarden, kan de procedures voor de regeling van geschillen beginnen in overeenstemming met het eerste lid, letter f of g.  

### 5  

Een Staat die Partij is kan te allen tijde de aandacht van de Raad vestigen op activiteiten die naar zijn mening strijdig zijn met de vereisten van het eerste lid, letters b tot en met d.  

### 6  

De Autoriteit stelt regels, voorschriften en procedures op die de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze titel waarborgen, met inbegrip van de desbetreffende regels, voorschriften en procedures voor de goedkeuring van werkplannen.  

### 7  

De bepalingen van artikel 151, eerste tot en met zevende lid en negende lid, artikel 162, tweede lid, letter q, artikel 165, tweede lid, letter n, en Bijlage III, artikel 6, vijfde lid, en artikel 7, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.  

### Titel  7  

####Economische steun

### 1  

Het beleid van de Autoriteit om steun te verlenen aan ontwikkelingslanden die ernstige nadelige gevolgen voor hun inkomsten uit export of hun economie ondervinden door een verlaging van de prijs van een getroffen delfstof of vermindering van de omvang van de export van die delfstof, voor zover deze verlaging of vermindering wordt veroorzaakt door werkzaamheden in het Gebied, is gebaseerd op de volgende beginselen: 

a. De Autoriteit vormt een fonds voor economische steun uit een deel van haar middelen die zij niet nodig heeft voor haar administratieve uitgaven. Het hiertoe gereserveerde bedrag wordt van tijd tot tijd door de Raad bepaald op aanbeveling van de Financiële Commissie. Alleen middelen uit van contractanten, met inbegrip van de Onderneming, ontvangen betalingen en vrijwillige bijdragen worden aangewend voor de vorming van het fonds voor economische steun;  

b. Op het land producerende ontwikkelingsstaten waarvan is vastgesteld dat hun economie ernstig wordt getroffen door de produktie van delfstoffen uit de zeebodem, ontvangen steun uit het fonds voor economische steun van de Autoriteit;  

c. De Autoriteit verleent steun uit het fonds aan getroffen op het land producerende ontwikkelingsstaten, in voorkomend geval in samenwerking met bestaande mondiale of regionale ontwikkelingsinstellingen die beschikken over de infrastructuur en de deskundigheid die nodig is om zulke steunprogramma's uit te voeren;  

d. De omvang en looptijd van deze steun worden van geval tot geval bepaald. Hierbij wordt de nodige aandacht geschonken aan de aard en de omvang van de problemen die getroffen op het land producerende ontwikkelingsstaten ondervinden.    

### 2  

Artikel 151, tiende lid, van het Verdrag wordt toegepast door middel van de maatregelen voor economische steun bedoeld in het eerste lid. Artikel 160, tweede lid, letter l, artikel 162, tweede lid, letter n, artikel 164, tweede lid, letter d, artikel 171, letter f, en artikel 173, tweede lid, letter c, worden dienovereenkomstig uitgelegd.  

### Titel  8  

####Financiële voorwaarden van contracten

### 1  

De volgende beginselen liggen ten grondslag aan het opstellen van regels, voorschriften en procedures voor de financiële voorwaarden van contracten: 

a. Het stelsel van betalingen aan de Autoriteit dient billijk te zijn voor zowel de contractant als de Autoriteit en dient middelen te omvatten die toereikend zijn om te bepalen of de contractant zich aan het stelsel houdt;  

b. De bedragen van de betalingen ingevolge het stelsel dienen vergelijkbaar te zijn met die welke gelden voor de winning op het land van dezelfde of soortgelijke delfstoffen, ten einde te vermijden dat de diepzeemijnbouw een kunstmatig concurrentievoordeel wordt toegekend of deze in een nadelige concurrentiepositie wordt gedwongen;  

c. Het stelsel dient niet ingewikkeld te zijn en geen hoge administratieve kosten voor de Autoriteit of een contractant met zich mee te brengen. Aandacht dient te worden geschonken aan het aannemen van een royalty-stelsel of een combinatie van een royalty- en winstdelingsstelsel. Indien wordt besloten tot verschillende stelsels, heeft de contractant het recht het op zijn contract toepasselijke stelsel te kiezen. Voor een latere wijziging in de keuze tussen verschillende stelsels is evenwel overeenstemming tussen de Autoriteit en de contractant vereist;  

d. Met ingang van de aanvangsdatum van commerciële produktie is een jaarlijkse vaste heffing verschuldigd. Deze heffing kan in mindering worden gebracht op andere betalingen die verschuldigd zijn ingevolge het in overeenstemming met letter c aangenomen stelsel. Het bedrag van de heffing wordt vastgesteld door de Raad;  

e. Het betalingsstelsel kan periodiek worden herzien in het licht van veranderende omstandigheden. Wijzigingen worden op non-discriminatoire wijze toegepast. Deze wijzigingen kunnen alleen van toepassing zijn op bestaande contracten indien de contractant dit verkiest. Voor een latere wijziging in de keuze tussen verschillende stelsels is overeenstemming tussen de Autoriteit en de contractant vereist;  

f. Geschillen betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van de op deze beginselen gebaseerde regels en voorschriften zijn onderworpen aan de procedures voor de regeling van geschillen neergelegd in het Verdrag.    

### 2  

De bepalingen van Bijlage III, artikel 13, derde tot en met tiende lid, van het Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing.  

### 3  

Wat betreft de toepassing van Bijlage III, artikel 13, tweede lid, van het Verdrag, is de heffing voor behandeling van een aanvrage om goedkeuring van een werkplan beperkt tot een fase, de exploratiefase dan wel de exploitatiefase; zij bedraagt US$250.000.  

### Titel  9  

####De Financiële Commissie

### 1  

Hierbij wordt een Financiële Commissie ingesteld. De Commissie bestaat uit 15 leden met de vereiste bekwaamheden op financieel gebied. De Staten die Partij zijn, dragen kandidaten voor die voldoen aan de hoogste normen van bekwaamheid en integriteit.  

### 2  

In de Financiële Commissie kan niet meer dan een onderdaan van dezelfde Staat die Partij is zitting hebben.  

### 3  

De Leden van de Financiële Commissie worden gekozen door de Vergadering en hierbij wordt naar behoren rekening gehouden met de noodzaak van een billijke geografische verdeling en de vertegenwoordiging van bijzondere belangen. Elke groep Staten bedoeld in titel 3, paragraaf 15, letters a, b, c en d, van deze Bijlage wordt door ten minste een lid in de Commissie vertegenwoordigd. Totdat de Autoriteit beschikt over voldoende middelen, naast de opgelegde bijdragen, om haar administratieve uitgaven te dekken, omvat het lidmaatschap van de Commissie vertegenwoordigers van de vijf contribuanten die de grootste financiële bijdrage leveren aan de administratieve begroting van de Autoriteit. Daarna geschiedt de verkiezing van een lid uit elke groep op basis van een voordracht door de leden van die groep, onverminderd de mogelijkheid dat uit elke groep meer leden worden gekozen.  

### 4  

De leden van de Financiële Commissie hebben zitting voor een termijn van vijf jaar. Zij kunnen worden herkozen voor een volgende termijn.  

### 5
