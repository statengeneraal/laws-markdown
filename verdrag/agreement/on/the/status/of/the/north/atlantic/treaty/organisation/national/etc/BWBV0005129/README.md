Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of this Agreement, a Member State which considers that any person has abused his privilege of residence or any other privilege or immunity granted to him under this Agreement may require him to leave its territory.  

### PART  II

### Article  5  

The Organisation, its property and assets, wheresoever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except in so far as in any particular case the Chairman of the Council Deputies, acting on behalf of the Organisation, may expressly authorise the waiver of this immunity. It is, however, understood that no waiver of immunity shall extend to any measure of execution or detention of property.  

### Article  6

### Article  9

### Article  11  

1.  No censorship shall be applied to the official correspondence and other official communications of the Organisation.

### PART  III  

####Representatives of Member States

### Article  12  

Every person designated by a Member State as its principal permanent representative to the Organisation in the territory of another Member State, and such members of his official staff resident in that territory as may be agreed between the State which has designated them and the Organisation and between the Organisation and the State in which they will be resident, shall enjoy the immunities and privileges accorded to diplomatic representatives and their official staff of comparable rank.

2.  Where the legal incidence of any form of taxation depends upon residence, a period during which a representative to whom this Article applies is present in the territory of another Member State for the discharge of his duties shall not be considered as a period of residence. In particular, he shall be exempt from taxation on his official salary and emoluments during such periods of duty.   
3.  In this Article “representative” shall be deemed to include all representatives, advisers and technical experts of delegations. Each Member State shall communicate to the other Member States concerned, if they so request, the names of its representatives to whom this Article applies and the probable duration of their stay in the territories of such other Member States.   

### Article  14  

Official clerical staff accompanying a representative of a Member State who are not covered by Articles 12 or 13 shall, while present in the territory of another Member State for the discharge of their duties, be accorded the privileges and immunities set out in paragraph 1 (*b*), (*c*), (*e*), (*f*), (*h*) and (*i*) and paragraph 2 of Article 13.  

### Article  15  

Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of Member States and their staffs not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the North Atlantic Treaty.

### Article  16

Functionarissen van de Organisatie bedoeld in artikel 17 omtrent wie overeenstemming is bereikt, zijn vrijgesteld van belasting op het salaris en de emolumenten door de Organisatie aan hen betaald in hun hoedanigheid als zodanige functionarissen. Iedere Staat, welke lid is van de Organisatie, kan echter met de Raad, welke handelt namens de Organisatie, een regeling treffen, waarbij zodanige Staat, die lid is van de Organisatie, al diegenen van zijn onderdanen (behalve, indien zulk een Staat dit verlangt, die welke niet hun gebruikelijke verblijfplaats hebben op zijn grondgebied) in dienst neemt en aan de Organisatie toevoegt, die dienst zullen doen als lid van de internationale staf van de Organisatie, en de salarissen en emolumenten van zulke personen betaalt uit eigen middelen en volgens een door die Staat vastgestelde schaal. De op deze wijze betaalde salarissen en emolumenten kunnen belast worden door een zodanige Staat, welke lid is van de Organisatie, maar zullen zijn vrijgesteld van belasting door enige andere Staat, welke lid is van de Organisatie. Indien zulk een regeling wordt getroffen door een Staat die lid is van de Organisatie, en daarna wordt gewijzigd of beëindigd, zullen de Staten-Leden niet langer gebonden zijn krachtens de eerste zin van dit artikel om de aan hun onderdanen betaalde salarissen en emolumenten vrij te stellen van belasting.

### Artikel  22  

Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan functionarissen en deskundigen verleend in het belang van de Organisatie en niet voor het persoonlijk voordeel van de individuele functionarissen en deskundigen. De Voorzitter van de Plaatsvervangende Leden van de Raad zal het recht en de plicht hebben afstand te doen van de immuniteit van een functionaris of deskundige, telkens wanneer naar zijn oordeel de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en van de immuniteit afstand kan worden gedaan zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de belangen van de Organisatie.
