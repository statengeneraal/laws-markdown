4.  In the event of any failure by the Government of Denmark efficiently to operate and maintain any of the Services, there shall be consultation between that Government and the Secretary General for the purpose of agreeing upon remedial measures.   

### Article  V  

The total costs of the Services computed in accordance with Annexes II and III to this Agreement shall not, for any one calendar year, exceed 4 663 463 United States dollars.

### Article  VI  

1.  For the purpose only of establishing, operating and maintaining services which have not otherwise been provided for pursuant to this Agreement, the limit determined pursuant to the provisions of Article V may be increased by a stated amount with the consent of Contracting Governments responsible in the aggregate for not less than ninety per cent of the total assessments made under the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Article VII in respect of the last calendar year for which assessments have been made.

### Article  VII  

1.  Subject to the provisions of Article V and paragraph 2 of Article VI, the Contracting Governments agree to share ninety-five per cent of the approved actual costs of the Services, as determined pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII, in proportion to the aeronautical benefit derived therefrom by each Contracting Government. Such proportion shall be determined for each Contracting Government in respect of each calendar year by the number of crossings between Europe and North America any portion of which lies north of the 45th parallel North between the meridians of 15° West and 50° West performed in that year by its civil aircraft. In addition: 

a) a crossing between only Greenland and Canada, Greenland and the United States of America, Greenland and Iceland or Iceland and Europe shall be counted as one-third of a crossing;  

b) a crossing between only Greenland and Europe, Iceland and Canada or Iceland and the United States of America shall be counted as two-thirds of a crossing; and

2.  For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article: 

a) a crossing shall be counted even if the point of take-off or landing is not in the territories mentioned in that paragraph; and  

b) “Europe” does not include Iceland or the Azores.     
3.  On or before 20 November each year, the Council shall assess the Contracting Governments for the purpose of providing advances for the following year. For the year 1983 the assessments shall be on the basis of the number of crossings in 1981 and ninety-five per cent of the estimated costs for 1983. The assessment of each Contracting Government shall be adjusted to take into account any difference between the amounts paid by it to the Organization as advances in respect of 1981 and its share, as determined by its crossings in 1981, of ninety-five per cent of the approved actual costs in 1981. The adjusted assessment of each Contracting Government shall be reduced by its share, as determined by its crossings in 1981, of the estimated revenues from user charges to be remitted under Article XIV to Denmark in1983.   
4.  The procedure set forth in paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply to the assessments for the year 1984 with appropriate changes of year.   
5.  For 1985 the procedure in paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply, with appropriate changes of year, and, in addition, the assessment of each Contracting Government shall be further adjusted to take into account any difference between its share of the estimated revenues from user charges for 1983 and its share, as determined by its crossings in 1983, of the audited actual user charge revenues remitted to Denmark in 1983.   
6.  The procedure for 1985 shall apply in subsequent years with appropriate changes of year.   
7.  On 1 January and 1 July of each calendar year starting on 1 January 1983, each Contracting Government shall pay to the Organization, in half-yearly instalments, the amount assessed to it in respect of advances for the current calendar year, adjusted and reduced as provided in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Article.   
8.  In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Council shall undertake adjustments so as to accomplish the objectives of this Article in respect of any period for which, at the date of termination of the Agreement, payments have not been adjusted pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Article.   
9.  On or before 1 May of each year, each Contracting Government shall furnish to the Secretary General, in such form as the Secretary General may prescribe, full particulars of the crossings to which this Article applies performed during the preceding calendar year.   
10.  The Contracting Governments may agree that the particulars referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article will be furnished to the Secretary General on their behalf by another Government.   

### Article  VIII  

1.  The Government of Denmark shall furnish to the Secretary-General, on or before 15 September of each year, estimates, expressed in Danish kroner, of the costs of the Services for the following calendar year. The estimates shall be drawn up in accordance with Article III and with Annexes II and III to this Agreement.   
2.  The Government of Denmark shall furnish to the Secretary General, not later than six months after the end of each calendar year, a statement of the actual costs of the Services during that year.

1.  The Government of Denmark shall be reimbursed for ninety-five per cent of the actual costs, as approved by the Council, of providing, operating and maintaining the Services.   
2.  The Council shall, after having satisfied itself that the estimates submitted by the Government of Denmark in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article VIII have been drawn up in accordance with Article III and with Annexes II and III to this Agreement, authorize the Secretary General to make payments to that Government in respect of each quarter, not later than the first day of the second month of that quarter. The payments shall be based on the estimates referred to and shall constitute advances, subject to adjustment as provided under paragraph 3 of this Article.

3.  For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, renewal of buildings and equipment from payments received on account of depreciation shall not be regarded as new capital expenditure.   
4.

### SECTION  III  

####USER CHARGES

### 1  

Pursuant to Article XIV of this Agreement, on or before 20 November 1982 the Council shall determine a single user charge per civil aircraft crossing for the calendar year 1983 for the Jointly Financed Services. The charge shall be calculated by dividing ninety-five per cent of the approved estimated costs, expressed in Danish kroner, allocable to civil aviation for 1983 (as defined in paragraph 6 below) plus an adjustment for under-recovery or minus an adjustment for over-recovery in 1981 (calculated in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 below) by the total number of crossings in 1981, rounded off to the nearest Danish krone.  

### 2  

The provisions of paragraph 1 above, with appropriate revision of the years mentioned therein, shall govern the calculation of the user charge per civil aircraft crossing for the calendar year 1984 and thereafter.  

### 3  

The over- or under-recovery referred to in paragraph 1 above is the difference between the amount subject to collection in any year (paragraph 4 below) and the total amounts billed to users in that year (paragraph 5 below).  

### 4  

The amount subject to collection in 1981 (for calculation of the 1983 user charge) is eighty per cent of ninety-five per cent of the approved costs allocable to civil aviation in 1981 less the over-recovery in 1979. In 1982 it is ninety-five per cent of the approved costs allocable to civil aviation in 1982 less the over-recovery in 1980. For 1983 and thereafter the amount subject to collection will be ninety-five per cent of the approved costs allocable to civil aviation in that year, less the over-recovery or plus the under-recovery of two years earlier.  

### 5  

In calculating the user charge for 1983, the amounts billed to users for 1981 (required to establish the over-or under-recovery for 1981) shall be calculated by multiplying that portion of the 1981 user charge in pounds sterling pertaining to this Agreement by the number of crossings in 1981, then converting to Danish kroner at the rates of exchange agreed for 1981. In subsequent years the amounts billed to users shall be calculated in the same way with appropriate changes of year.  

### 6  

For the purpose of calculation of user charges, the following percentages of the jointly financed costs (i.e. ninety-five per cent of the total costs) are allocable to international civil aviation: 

a) 30 per cent of the Meteorological Services (surface and upper-air synoptic observations) and related meteorological telecommunication services;  

b) 100 per cent of Aeronautical Communication and the Cable Services (excluding MET/COM);  

c) 90 per cent of the non-directional beacon (NDB) at Prins Christian Sund.

c) wordt een vlucht naar of van Europa of IJsland waarbij niet over de kust van Noord-Amerika wordt gevlogen, maar over 30° Westerlengte ten noorden van de 45ste Noordelijke breedtegraad wordt gevlogen, gerekend als een derde van een vlucht.     
2.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid van dit artikel: 

a) wordt een vlucht gerekend, zelfs wanneer het punt van opstijgen of landen niet in de in dat lid vermelde gebieden is gelegen; en  

b) omvat „Europa” niet IJsland of de Azoren.     
3.  Elk jaar op of vóór 20 november slaat de Raad de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen aan ten einde te voorzien in voorschotten voor het volgende jaar. Voor het jaar 1983 zijn de aanslagen op basis van het aantal vluchten in 1981 en vijfennegentig procent van de geraamde kosten voor 1983. De aanslag van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Regering wordt gecorrigeerd om rekening te houden met eventuele verschillen tussen de door haar aan de Organisatie betaalde bedragen als voorschotten voor 1981 en haar aandeel, zoals bepaald door haar vluchten in 1981, in de vijfennegentig procent van de goedgekeurde werkelijke kosten in 1981. De gecorrigeerde aanslag van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Regering wordt verminderd met haar aandeel, zoals bepaald door haar vluchten in 1981, in de geraamde inkomsten uit de heffingen aan gebruikers die ingevolge artikel XIV in 1983 aan Denemarken moeten worden overgemaakt.   
4.  De in het derde lid van dit artikel uiteengezette procedure geldt voor de aanslagen voor het jaar 1984 met passende wijzigingen wat het jaar betreft.   
5.  Voor 1985 geldt de in het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde procedure, met passende wijzigingen wat het jaar betreft, en daarnaast wordt de aanslag van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Regering nader gecorrigeerd om rekening te houden met eventuele verschillen tussen haar aandeel in de geraamde inkomsten uit de heffingen aan gebruikers over 1983 en haar aandeel, zoals bepaald door haar vluchten in 1983, in de door accountants gecontroleerde werkelijke heffingen aan gebruikers die in 1983 aan Denemarken zijn overgemaakt.   
6.  De procedure voor 1985 geldt in de volgende jaren met passende wijzigingen wat het jaar betreft.   
7.  Te beginnen op 1 januari 1983, betaalt elke Overeenkomstsluitende Regering, op 1 januari en 1 juli van elk kalenderjaar, in halfjaarlijkse termijnen aan de Organisatie het bedrag waarvoor zij is aangeslagen met betrekking tot de voorschotten voor het lopende kalenderjaar, gecorrigeerd en verminderd zoals bepaald in het derde, vierde, vijfde en zesde lid van dit artikel.   
8.  In geval van beëindiging van deze Overeenkomst past de Raad een verrekening toe, ten einde aan het bepaalde in dit artikel te voldoen met betrekking tot enige periode waarvoor de betalingen op het tijdstip van beëindiging van de Overeenkomst, nog niet zijn verrekend overeenkomstig het derde, vierde, vijfde en zesde lid van dit artikel.   
9.  Elk jaar op of vóór 1 mei verstrekt elke Overeenkomstsluitende Regering aan de Secretaris-Generaal, in de door de Secretaris-Generaal voor te schrijven vorm, volledige gegevens over de vluchten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, die zijn gemaakt in het voorgaande kalenderjaar.   
10.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen kunnen overeenkomen dat de in het negende lid van dit artikel bedoelde gegevens namens hen door een andere Regering aan de Secretaris-Generaal worden verstrekt.   

### Artikel  VIII  

1.  De Regering van Denemarken legt op of vóór 15 september van elk jaar aan de Secretaris-Generaal begrotingen over, uitgedrukt in Deense Kronen, van de kosten van de Diensten voor het volgende kalenderjaar. De begrotingen worden opgesteld overeenkomstig artikel III en de Bijlagen II en III van deze Overeenkomst.   
2.  De Regering van Denemarken zal aan de Secretaris-Generaal, niet later dan zes maanden na het eind van elk kalenderjaar, een opgave verstrekken van de werkelijk gemaakte kosten van de Diensten gedurende dat jaar. De Secretaris-Generaal zal de opgave aan zodanige verificatie en ander onderzoek onderwerpen als hij geschikt acht en zal aan de Regering van Denemarken een rapport van de verificatie overleggen.   
3.  De Regering van Denemarken zal aan de Secretaris-Generaal zulke aanvullende inlichtingen verstrekken met betrekking tot enige raming van de kosten of opgave van werkelijke kosten, als de Secretaris-Generaal wenselijk acht, evenals alle beschikbare inlichtingen over de mate waarin van de Diensten wordt gebruik gemaakt door vliegtuigen van enige nationaliteit.   
4.  De opgave van de werkelijke kosten voor elk jaar is onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de Raad.   
5.  De opgave van de werkelijke kosten, goedgekeurd door de Raad overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 4 van dit artikel, zal worden rondgezonden aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen.   

### Artikel  IX  

1.  Vijf en negentig procent van de door de Raad goedgekeurde werkelijke kosten voor het verschaffen, exploiteren en onderhouden van de Diensten zal aan de Regering van Denemarken worden terugbetaald.   
2.  Nadat de Raad zich ervan heeft overtuigd dat de door de Regering van Denemarken overeenkomstig artikel VIII, eerste lid, ingediende begrotingen zijn opgesteld overeenkomstig artikel III en de Bijlagen II en III van deze Overeenkomst, machtigt hij de Secretaris-Generaal betalingen te doen aan die Regering met betrekking tot elk kwartaal, niet later dan de eerste dag van de tweede maand van dat kwartaal. De betalingen zijn gebaseerd op genoemde begrotingen en vormen voorschotten, onderworpen aan verrekening als bepaald in het derde lid van dit artikel. Het totale bedrag van deze betalingen overschrijdt voor geen enkel jaar de ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel V vastgestelde limiet. Met ingang van 1 januari 1983 behandelt de Regering van Denemarken alle netto inkomsten uit heffingen aan gebruikers, geïnd van alle exploitanten van burgerluchtvaartuigen volgens een krachtens artikel XIV gehanteerd systeem, als deel van de voorschotten voor het jaar waarin deze inkomsten zijn ontvangen.   
3.  Na goedkeuring door de Raad van de opgave van de werkelijke kosten, zal de Secretaris-Generaal in alle opeenvolgende kwartaalbetalingen aan de Regering van Denemarken correcties aanbrengen, teneinde alle verschillen tussen de volgens lid 2 van dit artikel gedane betalingen over enig jaar en de goedgekeurde werkelijke kosten voor dat jaar te verrekenen.   
4.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen die niet in de Raad zijn vertegenwoordigd zullen worden uitgenodigd deel te nemen aan de behandeling in de Raad of een van zijn onderafdelingen van de door de Regering van Denemarken overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VIII, lid 1, verstrekte opgaven.   
5.  De kostenramingen, goedgekeurd door de Raad overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel, zullen aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen worden rondgezonden.   

### Artikel  X  

1.  De door de Organisatie overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VII van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen ontvangen betalingen zullen, voor zover zij niet van tijd tot tijd ingevolge deze Overeenkomst nodig zijn voor lopende betalingen aan de Regering van Denemarken, een Reserve Fonds vormen, dat door de Organisatie voor de doeleinden van deze Overeenkomst zal worden aangewend.   
2.  De Secretaris-Generaal kan er voor zorgdragen dat het Reserve Fonds voor korte termijn geïnvesteerd wordt. De Organisatie zal recht hebben op de daaruit voortvloeiende interest. Indien deze interest onvoldoende is om de buitengewone uitgaven van de Organisatie te dekken, die uit deze Overeenkomst voortvloeien, zal het overblijvende verschil worden beschouwd als een bijkomend gedeelte van de werkelijke kosten van de Diensten en aan de Organisatie worden terugbetaald uit de door de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen gedane betalingen.   

### Artikel  XI  

1.  De jaarlijkse aanslagen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen zullen worden uitgedrukt in Deense kronen.   
2.  Elk der Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen doet betalingen aan de Organisatie overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VII in Deense kronen. Betalingen kunnen ook worden gedaan in Amerikaanse dollars indien de voorschriften van de Regering die de betaling verricht, zulks vereisen. De procedure voor de bepaling van de op een in Amerikaanse dollars verrichte betaling toepasselijke wisselkoers wordt vastgesteld door de Raad in overleg met de betrokken Regeringen.   
3.  De Secretaris-Generaal zal, behoudens dat de buitengewone uitgaven van de Organisatie in Amerikaanse dollars aan deze worden terugbetaald, aan de Regering van Denemarken overeenkomstig de bepalingen, vervat in de artikelen IX en XII, betalingen doen in de valuta waarin de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen hun betalingen hebben gedaan aan de Organisatie, voor zover beschikbaar.   

### Artikel  XII  

1.  De verplichting van de Secretaris-Generaal, ingevolge deze Overeenkomst aan de Regering van Denemarken betalingen te doen, zal beperkt zijn tot de bedragen die werkelijk door de Organisatie zijn ontvangen en volgens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst beschikbaar zijn.   
2.  De Secretaris-Generaal kan niettemin, in afwachting van de ontvangst van betalingen van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen en in overeenstemming met de financiële bepalingen van de Organisatie, voorschotten verstrekken voor aan de Regering van Denemarken verschuldigde betalingen, in gevallen waarin hij zulke voorschotten onontbeerlijk acht voor de instelling en ononderbroken voortzetting van de Diensten.   
3.  Geen Overeenkomstsluitende Regering zal de Organisatie aansprakelijk kunnen stellen wegens het feit dat enige andere Overeenkomstsluitende Regering haar betalingen met betrekking tot deze Overeenkomst niet verricht.   

### Artikel  XIII  

1.  De Raad kan, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van artikel V en lid 2 van artikel VI en in overeenstemming met de Regering van Denemarken, in deze Overeenkomst nieuwe kapitaalsuitgaven opnemen, die noodzakelijk zijn voor de goede exploitatie van de Diensten.   
2.  De Raad kan, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de artikelen V en VI en in overeenstemming met de Regering van Denemarken, in deze Overeenkomst, naast de in Bijlage I genoemde Diensten, diensten en nieuwe kapitaalsuitgaven met betrekking tot deze diensten opnemen, mits aan één van de volgende voorwaarden wordt voldaan: 

a) het totale bedrag van dergelijke uitgaven in enig jaar 3,5 procent van de ingevolge artikel V goedgekeurde kostenlimiet niet te bovengaat; of  

b) alle Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen hebben tot dergelijke diensten hun toestemming gegeven; of  

c) de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen die gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor niet minder dan negentig procent van de totale aanslagen, vastgesteld ingevolge de bepalingen van het derde, vierde, vijfde en zesde lid van artikel VII, hebben toegestemd tot dergelijke diensten en de bepalingen van artikel VI zijn erop toegepast.     
3.  Voor de toepassing van de leden 1 en 2 van dit artikel zal vernieuwing van gebouwen en uitrusting uit betalingen, ontvangen op grond van depreciatie, niet als nieuwe kapitaalsuitgave worden beschouwd.   
4.  Indien nieuwe kapitaalsuitgaven of additionele diensten worden voorgesteld door de Regering van Denemarken of door de Raad, zal die Regering aan de Secretaris-Generaal een kostenraming daarvan verstrekken, alsmede die specificaties, plannen en andere inlichtingen welke met betrekking daartoe vereist kunnen zijn, en zal zij met de Secretaris-Generaal overleg plegen betreffende de wijze waarop hierin zal worden voorzien.of het ontwerp of de constructie welke dient te worden toegepast.

De netto inkomsten uit deze heffingen worden in mindering gebracht op ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst aan de Regering van Denemarken verschuldigde betalingen. Behalve met toestemming van de Raad heft de Regering van Denemarken geen bijkomende heffingen voor de Diensten, van anderen dan haar eigen onderdanen.

### Artikel  XVII  

De Raad zal een conferentie bijeenroepen van alle belanghebbende Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen: 

(a) op verzoek van twee of meer van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen of van de Regering van Denemarken, of van een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen indien een dergelijke conferentie gedurende de vijf voorgaande jaren niet is gehouden;  

(b) wanneer het verzuim van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen haar betalingen te doen met betrekking tot deze Overeenkomst een herziening van de aanslagen noodzakelijk maakt, welke niet anders op bevredigende wijze kan worden geregeld, of  

(c) wanneer de Raad om enige andere reden een dergelijke conferentie noodzakelijk acht.    

### Artikel  XVIII  

Elk geschil betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst of van de Bijlagen daarvan, dat niet door onderhandelingen is beslecht, zal op verzoek van een Overeenkomstsluitende Regering die partij is bij het geschil om advies naar de Raad worden verwezen.

2.  De Raad kan overleg openen met elke geen partij bij deze Overeenkomst zijnde Regering welker burgerluchtvaartlijnen profiteren van de Diensten, teneinde haar toetreding tot de Overeenkomst te bewerkstelligen.   
3.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel kan de Raad overeenkomsten sluiten inzake bijdragen van enige Regering die geen partij wordt bij deze Overeenkomst.

### Artikel  XXI  

1.  Deze Overeenkomst treedt — niet eerder dan 1 januari 1957 — in werking, wanneer akten van aanvaarding of toetreding zijn nedergelegd door Regeringen die gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor eerste aanslagen tot een bedrag van niet minder dan negentig procent van het aanvankelijke maximum kostencijfer bepaald in artikel V. Wat die Regeringen betreft, wordt de nederlegging van een akte van aanvaarding of van toetreding geacht de toestemming te vormen tot het systeem van aanslagen, betalingen en verrekeningen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst voor de periode tussen 1 januari 1957 en de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst.

(b) Indien het te enigertijd de Regering van Denemarken onmogelijk blijkt, de Diensten uit te voeren binnen de krachtens de bepalingen van artikel V gestelde limiet, zal die Regering de Secretaris-Generaal daarvan onmiddellijk schriftelijk in kennis stellen en zal zij aan de Secretaris-Generaal een gespecificeerde raming van het vereiste additionele bedrag verschaffen. De Secretaris-Generaal zal zodanige raming dadelijk aan een onderzoek onderwerpen en, na eventueel noodzakelijk overleg met die Regering, het boven de genoemde limiet benodigde bedrag bepalen. De Secretaris-Generaal zal daarop de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen benaderen teneinde hun toestemming te verkrijgen, als vereist ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel V. Tenzij binnen drie maanden, nadat de Secretaris-Generaal het vereiste additionele bedrag heeft bepaald, hij de Regering van Denemarken mededeelt dat de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen hun toestemming hebben gegeven, kan de Regering van Denemarken daarna deze Overeenkomst beëindigen door schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal met inachtneming van een termijn van drie maanden.  

(c) Deze Overeenkomst kan op 31 december van enig jaar worden beëindigd door andere Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen dan de Regering van Denemarken, welke verantwoordelijk zijn voor lopende aanslagen welke gezamenlijk niet minder bedragen dan tien procent van de krachtens artikel V bepaalde limiet, door schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal niet later dan 1 januari van dat jaar.     
2.  Na ontvangst van een kennisgeving of kennisgevingen van de wens, deze Overeenkomst in overeenstemming met lid 1 van dit artikel te beëindigen, zal de Secretaris-Generaal de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen daarvan verwittigen.   

### Artikel  XXIII  

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel XXII kan elke andere Overeenkomstsluitende Regering dan de Regering van Denemarken, waarvan de lopende aanslag minder bedraagt dan tien procent van de krachtens de bepalingen van artikel V bepaalde limiet, ophouden partij te zijn bij deze Overeenkomst op 31 december van enig jaar, door schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal, niet later dan 1 januari van dat jaar, van haar voornemen haar deelneming te beëindigen. Elke zodanige kennisgeving zal ook worden beschouwd als een kennisgeving van de wens deze Overeenkomst te beëindigen, voor de toepassing van artikel XXII, lid 1 (*c*).   
2.  Na ontvangst van de mededeling van enige Overeenkomstsluitende Regering, dat zij haar deelneming beëindigt, zal de Secretaris-Generaal de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen daarvan verwittigen.   

### Artikel  XXIV  

1.  Ingeval van beëindiging van deze Overeenkomst door de Regering van Denemarken ingevolge de bepalingen van lid 1 van artikel XXII zal deze Regering aan de Organisatie betalen of kan de Organisatie van de aan die Regering krachtens deze Overeenkomst verschuldigde betalingen aftrekken een bedrag hetwelk een billijke vergoeding vormt voor voordelen, voortvloeiende uit het verkrijgen voor eigen doeleinden van roerende of onroerende goederen waarvan de kosten geheel of gedeeltelijk aan die Regering zijn terugbetaald ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.

Alle betalingen die voor dit doel van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen worden gevorderd zullen worden berekend op basis van de meest recente aanslagcijfers en zullen verschuldigd zijn vanaf de datum van beëindiging. De Organisatie zal het recht hebben alle roerende goederen over te nemen voor welke een vergoeding is betaald overeenkomstig dit lid. Met elke afstand van een dergelijk recht zal rekening worden gehouden bij het bepalen van de vergoeding.   
3.  De bepalingen van lid 2 van dit artikel zullen overeenkomstig van toepassing zijn met betrekking tot enig gedeelte van de Diensten, dat uitgesloten is van de Overeenkomst ingevolge de bepalingen van lid 5 van artikel XIII.   
4.  Het bedrag van alle betalingen ingevolge dit artikel zal bij Overeenkomst tussen de Raad en de Regering van Denemarken worden bepaald.   

### Artikel  XXV  

1.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van lid 2 van artikel X zullen alle saldi van het Reserve Fonds en van rente daarover, berustende onder de Organisatie op de datum dat deze Overeenkomst ophoudt van kracht te zijn, worden verdeeld onder en terugbetaald aan die Regeringen welke onmiddellijk vóór die datum nog partij waren bij deze Overeenkomst, op basis van hun meest recente jaarlijkse aanslagen.   
2.  

(a) Elke Regering die opgehouden heeft partij te zijn bij deze Overeenkomst ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel XXIII zal alle verschillen tussen het aan de Organisatie overeenkomstig artikel VII door haar betaalde bedrag en het haar betreffende aandeel in de goedgekeurde werkelijke kosten met betrekking tot de periode van haar deelname betalen aan of ontvangen van de Organisatie.

4.  De Secretaris-Generaal zendt voor eensluidend gewaarmerkte afschriften van elke aanvaarde wijziging aan alle Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen en stelt deze in kennis van alle aanvaardingen en van de datum van inwerkingtreding van een wijziging.   
5.  De Raad kan ook in andere gevallen dan in die, genoemd in lid 6 van artikel XIII, de Bijlagen van deze Overeenkomst wijzigen, mits in overeenstemming met de in de Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden en met toestemming van de Regering van Denemarken.

####HEFFINGEN AAN GEBRUIKERS

### 1  

Ingevolge artikel XIV van deze Overeenkomst stelt de Raad op of vóór 20 november 1982 voor het kalenderjaar 1983 voorde gezamenlijk gefinancierde diensten één enkele heffing aan de gebruiker vast per burgerluchtvaartuig dat een vlucht maakt. De heffing wordt berekend door vijfennegentig procent van de goedgekeurde geraamde kosten, uitgedrukt in Deense kronen, te bestemmen voor de burgerluchtvaart voor 1983 (zoals omschreven in paragraaf 6 hieronder), plus een correctie voor te weinig ontvangen terugbetaling of minus een correctie voor te veel ontvangen terugbetaling in 1981 (berekend overeenkomstig de paragrafen 3, 4 en 5 hieronder) te delen door het totaal aantal vluchten in 1981, afgerond tot de naaste hele Deense kroon.  

### 2  

De bepalingen in paragraaf 1 hierboven, met passende herziening van de daarin genoemde jaren, gelden voor de berekening van de heffing aan de gebruiker per vlucht van een burgerluchtvaartuig voor het kalenderjaar 1984 en de jaren daarna.  

### 3  

De in paragraaf 1 hierboven bedoelde te weinig of te veel ontvangen terugbetaling is het verschil tussen het in een jaar te innen bedrag (paragraaf 4 hieronder) en de totale bedragen die gebruikers in dat jaar in rekening worden gebracht (paragraaf 5 hieronder).  

### 4  

Het in 1981 te innen bedrag (voor de berekening van de heffing aan de gebruiker in 1983) is tachtig procent van vijfennegentig procent van de goedgekeurde kosten te bestemmen voor de burgerluchtvaart in 1981, verminderd met de te veel ontvangen terugbetaling in 1979. In 1982 is het vijfennegentig procent van de goedgekeurde kosten te bestemmen voor de burgerluchtvaart in 1982, verminderd met de te veel ontvangen terugbetaling in 1980. Voor 1983 en de jaren daarna is het te innen bedrag vijfennegentig procent van de goedgekeurde kosten te bestemmen voor de burgerluchtvaart in dat jaar, verminderd met de te veel ontvangen terugbetaling of vermeerderd met de te weinig ontvangen terugbetaling twee jaar tevoren.  

### 5  

Bij de berekening van de heffing aan de gebruiker voor 1983 worden de aan gebruikers voor 1981 in rekening gebrachte bedragen (vereist om de te veel of te weinig ontvangen terugbetaling voor 1981 vast te stellen) berekend door dat deel van de heffing aan de gebruiker voor 1981 in pond sterling dat onder deze Overeenkomst valt te vermenigvuldigen met het aantal vluchten in 1981, dit dan om te rekenen in Deense kronen volgens de voor 1981 overeengekomen wisselkoersen. In volgende jaren worden de aan de gebruikers in rekening gebrachte bedragen op dezelfde wijze berekend met passende wijzigingen wat het jaar betreft.  

### 6  

Ten behoeve van de berekening van de heffingen aan gebruikers: zijn de onderstaande percentages van de gezamenlijk gefinancierde kosten (dat wil zeggen vijfennegentig procent van de totale kosten) die kunnen worden bestemd voor de internationale burgerluchtvaart: 

a) 30 procent van de Meteorologische Diensten (synoptische waarnemingen op de grond en in de hogere luchtlagen) en daarmede samenhangende meteorologische telecommunicatiediensten;  

b) 100 procent van de luchtvaartkundige communicatie en de telegraafdiensten (met uitzondering van MET/COM);  

c) 90 procent van het ongericht radiobaken (NDB) bij het Prins Christian Sund.
