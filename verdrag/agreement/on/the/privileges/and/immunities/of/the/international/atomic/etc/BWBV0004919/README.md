*Section 12*  Representatives of Members at meetings convened by the Agency shall, while exercising their functions and during their journeys to and from the place of meeting, enjoy the following privileges and immunities: 

(a) Immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage, and in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in their official capacity, immunity from legal process of every kind;  

(b) Inviolability for all papers and documents;  

(c) The right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags;  

(d) Exemption in respect of themselves and their spouses from immigration restrictions, aliens' registration or national service obligations in the State which they are visiting or through which they are passing in the exercise of their functions;  

(e) The same facilities in respect of currency or exchange restrictions as are accorded to representatives of foreign Governments on temporary official missions;  

(f) The same immunities and facilities in respect of their personal baggage as are accorded to members of comparable rank of diplomatic missions.    *Section 13*  In order to secure for the representatives of Members of the Agency at meetings convened by the Agency complete freedom of speech and complete independence in the discharge of their duties, the immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in discharging their duties shall continue to be accorded, notwithstanding that the persons concerned are no longer engaged in the discharge of such duties.  *Section 14*  Where the incidence of any form of taxation depends upon residence, periods during which the representatives of Members of the Agency at meetings convened by the Agency are present in a Member State for the discharge of their duties shall not be considered as periods of residence.  *Section 15*  Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of Members, not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connexion with the Agency. Consequently, a Member not only has the right but is under a duty to waive the immunity of its representatives in any case where, in the opinion of the Member, the immunity would impede the course of justice, and where it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded.  *Section 16*  The provisions of sections 12, 13 and 14 are not applicable in relation to the authorities of a State of which the person is a national or of which he is or has been a representative.

(i) Be immune from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity;

Should other officials of the Agency be called up for national service, the State concerned shall, at the request of the Agency, grant such temporary deferments in the call-up of such officials as may be necessary to avoid interruption in the continuation of essential work.  *Section 20*  In addition to the privileges and immunities specified in sections 18 and 19 above, the Director General of the Agency, including any official acting on his behalf during his absence from duty, shall be accorded on behalf of himself, his spouse and minor children, the privileges and immunities, exemptions and facilities accorded to diplomatic envoys on behalf of themselves, their spouses and minor children, in accordance with international law. The same privileges and immunities, exemptions and facilities shall also be accorded to a Deputy Director General or official of equivalent rank of the Agency.  *Section 21*  Privileges and immunities are granted to officials in the interest of the Agency only and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves.

### Article  VII  

####Experts on missions for the Agency

*Section 23*  Experts (other than officials coming within the scope of Article VI) serving on committees of the Agency or performing missions for the Agency, including missions as inspectors under Article XII of the Statute of the Agency and as project examiners under Article XI thereof, shall be accorded the following privileges and immunities so far as is necessary for the effective exercise of their functions, including the time spent on journeys in connexion with service on such committees or missions: 

(a) Immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage;

The Agency shall have the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any expert in any case where, in its opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the Agency.  

### Article  VIII  

####Abuses of privilege

*Section 26*  If any State party to this Agreement considers that there has been an abuse of a privilege or immunity conferred by this Agreement, consultations shall be held between that State and the Agency to determine whether any such abuse has occurred and, if so, to attempt to ensure that no repetition occurs. If such consultations fail to achieve a result satisfactory to the State and the Agency, the question whether an abuse of a privilege or immunity has occurred shall be settled by a procedure in accordance with section 34. If it is found that such an abuse has occurred, the State party to this Agreement affected by such abuse has the right, after notification to the Agency, to withhold from the Agency the benefits of the privilege or immunity so abused. However, the withholding of privileges or immunities must not interfere with the Agency's principal activities or prevent the Agency from performing its principal functions.  *Section 27*  Representatives of Members at meetings convened by the Agency, while exercising their functions and during their journeys to and from the place of meeting, and officials within the meaning of section 1 (v), shall not be required by the territorial authorities to leave the country in which they are performing their functions on account of any activities by them in their official capacity. In the case, however, of abuse of privileges of residence committed by any such person in activities in that country outside his official functions, he may be required to leave by the Government of that country, provided that: 

(a) Representatives of Members, or persons who are entitled to the immunities provided in section 20, shall not be required to leave the country otherwise than in accordance with the diplomatic procedure applicable to diplomatic envoys accredited to that country;  

(b) In the case of an official to whom section 20 is not applicable, no order to leave the country shall be issued by the territorial authorities other than with the approval of the Foreign Minister of the country in question, and such approval shall be given only after consultation with the Director General of the Agency; and, if expulsion proceedings are taken against an official, the Director-General of the Agency shall have the right to appear in such proceedings on behalf of the person against whom they are instituted.    

### Article  IX  

####Laissez-passer

*Section 28*  Officials of the Agency shall be entitled to use the United Nations *laissez-passer* in conformity with administrative arrangements concluded between the Director General of the Agency and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Director General of the Agency shall notify each State party to this Agreement of the administrative arrangements so concluded.  *Section 29*  States parties to this Agreement shall recognize and accept the United Nations *laissez-passer* issued to officials of the Agency as valid travel documents.  *Section 30*  Applications for visas, where required, from officials of the Agency holding United Nations *laissez-passer,* when accompanied by a certificate that they are travelling on the business of the Agency, shall be dealt with as speedily as possible. In addition, such persons shall be granted facilities for speedy travel.  *Section 31*  Similar facilities to those specified in section 30 shall be accorded to experts and other persons who, though not holders of United Nations *laissez-passer,* have a certificate that they are travelling on the business of the Agency.  *Section 32*  The Director General, the Deputy Directors General and other officials of a rank not lower than head of division of the Agency, travelling on United Nations *laissez-passer* on the business of the Agency, shall be granted the same facilities for travel as are accorded to officials of comparable rank in diplomatic missions.  

### Article  X  

####Settlement of disputes

*Section 33*  The Agency shall make provision for appropriate modes of settlement of: 

(a) Disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private character to which the Agency is a party;  

(b) Disputes involving any official or expert of the Agency who by reason of his official position enjoys immunity, if immunity has riot been waived in accordance with sections 21 or 25.    *Section 34*  Unless in any case it is agreed by the parties to have recourse to another mode of settlement, all differences arising out of the interpretation or application of the present Agreement shall be referred to the International Court of Justice, in accordance with the Statute of the Court. If a difference arises between the Agency and a Member and they do not agree on any other mode of settlement, a request shall be made for an advisory opinion on any legal question involved, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations and Article 65 of the Statute of the Court and the relevant provisions of the agreement concluded between the United Nations and the Agency. The opinion given by the Court shall be accepted as decisive by the parties.  

### Article  XI  

####Interpretation

*Section 35*  The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in the light of the functions with which the Agency is entrusted by its Statute.  *Section 36*  The provisions of this Agreement shall in no way limit or prejudice the privileges and immunities which have been, or may hereafter be, accorded to the Agency by any State by reason of the location in the territory of that State of the Agency's Headquarters or regional offices, or of officials, experts, materials, equipment or facilities in connexion with Agency projects or activities, including the application of safeguards to an Agency project or other arrangement. This Agreement shall not be deemed to prevent the conclusion between the Agency and any State party thereto of supplemental agreements adjusting the provisions of this Agreement or extending or curtailing the privileges and immunities thereby granted.  *Section 37*  This Agreement shall not itself operate so as to abrogate, or derogate from, any provisions of the Statute of the Agency or any rights or obligations which the Agency may otherwise have, acquire or assume.

Amendments approved by the Board shall enter into force upon their acceptance in accordance with the procedure provided in section 38.
