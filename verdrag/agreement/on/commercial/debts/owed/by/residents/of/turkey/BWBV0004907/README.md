(i) any payment made to that Central Bank in respect of a debt before the date of the coming into force of the present Agreement or deemed to have been made to it in accordance with paragraph (*b*) before that date which has not been previously transferred to the creditor; and

For the purposes of this calculation, the rate of exchange applied shall be the effective rate of exchange ruling in Turkey in accordance with Turkish regulations on the date on which the payment has been made or is deemed to have been made in accordance with paragraph (*b*)*.*     

### Article  6  

####Obligations Arising from the Application of Article 5

### Article  7  

####The Transfer Scheme

(a).  In order to provide for the settlement of debts under the present Agreement, the Turkish Government shall, in the period of twelve years following its signature, ensure each year the transfer, in appropriate currencies, of a total amount to the creditors resident in each creditor country (hereinafter called the “annual transfer”) which shall be determined and transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Article. In addition, the Turkish Government shall ensure the transfer of moratorium interest or contractual moratorium interest, as the case may be, as provided for in Article 10.   
(b).  In the first six years of that period, the total amount of annual transfers, including transfers in respect of debts to United States creditors (such total amount hereinafter called the “total amount of annual transfers”), shall: 

(i) in the first five years of that period be equivalent to 15 million, 20 million, 25 million, 30 million and 35 million United States dollars, successively, in each year;  

(ii) in the sixth year of that period, be equal to one-seventh of the total amount of payments in the process of transfer to all the creditor countries on 31st December, 1963.     
(c).  **In each of the first six years of that period, subject to the provisions of paragraph (*e*), the total amount of annual transfers shall be divided between creditor countries according to the ratio between the payments in the process of transfer to each creditor country on the reference date and the total amount of the payments in process of transfer to all creditor countries on the same date *provided* that: 

(i) the reference date shall be 5th August, 1958, for the first two years of that period; 31st December, 1960, for its third and fourth year; and 31st December, 1962, for its fifth and sixth year; and that  

(ii) the annual transfers for the first two years of that period shall be calculated in accordance with the table set out in Annex I to the present Agreement; and that  

(iii) on the basis of this distribution between creditor countries, the payments to United States creditors in the third, fourth, and fifth year shall be 13.939,14.206 and 14.314 per cent., respectively, of the total amount of annual transfers to all the creditor countries, and in the sixth year, equal to one-seventh of the total amount of payments in the process of transfer to United States creditors on 31st December, 1963. This arrangement shall not affect the total amount of annual transfers provided in paragraph *(b).*     
(d).  

(i) The total amount of payments in the process of transfer on any of these reference dates shall be calculated in United States dollars on the basis of the parities between the appropriate currencies and the United States dollar in force on that reference date. The annual transfer to each creditor country shall be expressed in the appropriate currencies on the basis of the parities used in the preceding calculation of the total amount of payments in the process of transfer. Nevertheless, in the calculations relating to the first two annual transfers, the parities in force at the date of the signature of the present Agreement shall be used.  

(ii) For the purposes of the present Agreement, the parity between an appropriate currency and the United States dollar shall be taken to be the declared International Monetary Fund par value on the relevant reference date. Where such parity does not exist, the official United States dollar parity in the country concerned shall be used or a parity calculated from the legal fine gold content of the currency concerned and the declared International Monetary Fund par value in terms of gold of the United States dollar on the relevant reference date.     
(e).  To the extent that it is required for the settlement of debts owed to creditors resident in Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and, in the case of the annual transfers for the third year of that period, in Denmark, the Turkish Government shall ensure, in the first three years of that period, annual transfers to each of these creditor countries which, in total, shall represent two per cent, of the total amount of annual transfers for the corresponding year.   
(f).  **In the remaining six years of that period, the annual transfer to each creditor country shall be, successively, equal to one-sixth, one-fifth, one-fourth, one-third, one-half, and to the remainder of the total amount of payments in the process of transfer to that country on 31st December of the year preceding the year in which the corresponding annual transfer is made.   
(g).  The Turkish Government shall carry out each annual transfer, in accordance with the Lists provided for in paragraph (*a*) of Article 8, in four equal instalments on 30th June, 30th September, 31st December, and 31st March, respectively, of each year *provided* that: 

(i) in the first year the instalments shall be transferred not later than 31st July, 31st October, 31st December, 1959, and 31st March, 1960, respectively; and that  

(ii) the amount to be transferred in accordance with this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount of any payment in the process of transfer which should have been transferred in the corresponding year and the counterpart of which has been used in Turkey by virtue of Article 9.     

### Article  8  

####Execution of the Transfer Scheme

(a).  The competent Turkish authorities shall regularly establish, in consultation with the appropriate institution of each creditor country, a List which shall determine the creditors in that country to which the appropriate institution of Turkey shall make transfers.   
(b).  The Lists referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be established in the order of settlement agreed by common accord between the Turkish Government and the Contracting Party concerned and shall provide priority for payments to any creditor the total amount of whose claims does not exceed a specified amount agreed by common accord. The order of settlement may be subsequently modified by common accord.   
(c).  In order to carry out the transfer to the creditors determined by the Lists provided for in the preceding paragraphs, the appropriate institution of Turkey shall transmit, through the intermediary of the appropriate institution of the creditor country concerned, a paying order in favour of each of those creditors established, taking into account the provisions of Article 10, in conformity with the terms of the notification made in accordance with paragraphs (*c*) and (*d*) of Article 5.   

### Article  9  

####Use of Funds in Turkey

(a).

(b).  To the extent that it is to be used by virtue of the preceding paragraph, the payment in the process of transfer shall be reconverted into Turkish currency at the effective rate of exchange ruling in Turkey at the date of the reconversion for operations of the same kind effected by means of new remittances in foreign currency.   

### Article  10  

####Moratorium Interest

(a).  The Turkish Government shall pay to the creditor moratorium interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum in respect of any payment in the process of transfer *provided,* however, that such payment has not been used in Turkey by virtue of Article 9.   
(b).  Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, no moratorium interest shall be payable whenever, in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract, duly authorised by the Turkish authorities, the debtor has undertaken to pay interest to the creditor from the date on which payment is due until the completion of its transfer (in the present Agreement called “contractual moratorium interest”). Payments made to the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey in respect of contractual moratorium interest shall be: 

(i) calculated in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (*a*) (*iii*) of Article 5 and transferred to the creditor concerned in accordance with the provisions of this Article and with the principles set out in paragraph (*a*) (*ii*) of Article 6; and  

(ii) deemed to be moratorium interest for the purposes of transfer as provided in paragraphs (*d*) and (*e*).     
(c).  Moratorium interest shall be payable as from the date of the signature of the present Agreement or the date on which the payment is due, whichever is the later date, until the completion of the transfer of the payment or its utilisation by virtue of Article 9. Moratorium interest shall be determined and transferred in the appropriate currency.   
(d).  Subject to paragraph (*e*), moratorium interest shall be paid and transferred to the creditor concerned on 31st December of each year *provided,* however, that, whenever the payment to which such interest relates is transferred, the moratorium interest remaining payable in respect thereof shall be transferred at the same time.   
(e).  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (*d*), moratorium interest on payments in the process of transfer which, under that paragraph, falls due on 31st December, 1959, may be transferred thereafter *provided* it is transferred as soon as possible and, in any event, before 1st January, 1961. Whenever it is transferred at any date after 31st December, 1959, the whole of the interest payable up to the former date, in accordance with paragraph (*c*), shall be paid and transferred at the same time.   

### Article  11  

####Prior Amortisation Agreements

(a).  Bilateral Agreements, previously concluded by the Turkish Government with any other Contracting Party, relating to the amortisation of Turkish external commercial debts, as well as provisions relating thereto in other Agreements between the Turkish Government and any other Contracting Party, shall no longer apply as from the date of the signature of the present Agreement and shall be abrogated by bilateral Agreements entered into in pursuance of Article 13, with effect as from the date of the coming into force of the present Agreement.   
(b).  In abrogating these Agreements or provisions, the Parties concerned shall provide that, as far as any account is concerned which is opened in the name of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey by the appropriate institution of the creditor country in pursuance of such a bilateral Agreement or provision:

(b).  Bilateral Agreements shall be consistent with the provisions of the present Agreement.

However, the provisions of the bilateral Agreement between the Turkish Government and the Italian Government, linked with the particular rules of application envisaged by the Italian authorities with a view to the application of the present Agreement to creditors resident in Italy and resulting from the eventual substitution of such creditors by an institution which would be designated by these authorities in the bilateral Agreement, shall not be considered as inconsistent with the present Agreement.

####Betalingen

a.  De betalingen in Turkse ponden, met betrekking tot schulden, zullen geschieden bij de Centrale Bank van de Turkse Republiek, die deze betalingen zal aanvaarden op de door de Turkse autoriteiten goedgekeurde vervaldatum, op voorwaarde dat: 

i. de verplichting bedoelde betalingen te doen een verplichting is gebleven, die uitsluitend rust op de debiteur;  

ii. een verzoek om transfer van het gestorte bedrag, goedgekeurd door de Turkse autoriteiten, is of wordt voorgelegd aan genoemde Centrale Bank;  

iii. voor het geval het gaat om een schuld uitgedrukt in een andere valuta dan het Turkse pond, het te storten bedrag wordt berekend volgens de effectieve wisselkoers die geldt in Turkije overeenkomstig de Turkse regelingen die van kracht zijn op de datum waarop de betaling heeft plaatsgehad, of wordt geacht te hebben plaatsgehad, overeenkomstig lid *b*.     
b.  Indien de debiteur krachtens een hem door de Turkse wetgeving of regelingen verleende speciale status, door de Turkse autoriteiten behoorlijk gemachtigd is de betaling te verrichten na de datum waarop deze opeisbaar is geworden, zal de betaling geacht worden te zijn verricht, ten aanzien van de onderhavige Overeenkomst, op de datum waarvoor oorspronkelijk vergunning voor die betaling gegeven was, onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van lid *a,* sub *ii*, van Artikel 6.   
c.  De Centrale Bank van de Turkse Republiek zal zo spoedig mogelijk aan de bevoegde instelling van het crediteurland kennis geven van: 

i. iedere storting bij genoemde Centrale Bank uit hoofde van een schuld, verricht vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding van de onderhavige Overeenkomst, of die geacht wordt te zijn verricht vóór die datum, overeenkomstig lid *b,* en nog niet getransfereerd is aan de crediteur;  

ii. iedere storting verricht bij genoemde Centrale Bank, overeenkomstig lid *a*, of die geacht wordt te zijn verricht, overeenkomstig lid *b*, sedert die datum.     
d.  In de kennisgeving zal worden vermeld: 

i. het bedrag gestort bij de Centrale Bank van de Republiek Turkije, in Turkse ponden;  

ii. het bedrag der storting uitgedrukt in dezelfde valuta als de oorspronkelijke verplichting, waarvoor vergunning verleend was door de Turkse autoriteiten of, in het geval van een in Turkse ponden uitgedrukte schuld, in de valuta van het crediteurland waar de crediteur woonachtig is (beide valuta's hieronder aangeduid als „de geëigende valuta's”). Voor deze berekening zal de toe te passen wisselkoers de effectieve wisselkoers zijn, die in Turkije geldt overeenkomstig de Turkse regelingen van kracht op de datum waarop de storting is verricht of wordt geacht te zijn verricht, overeenkomstig lid *b*.     

### Artikel  6  

####Verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit de toepassing van Artikel 5

De Turkse Regering zal er zorg voor dragen:

ii. zal worden getransfereerd aan de belanghebbende crediteur, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Artikel 7, in de geëigende valuta, tegen de wisselkoers die geldt in Turkije, overeenkomstig de Turkse regelingen geldend op de datum waarop de storting is verricht, of wordt geacht te zijn verricht, overeenkomstig lid *b* van Artikel 5, met dien verstande dat iedere storting die geacht wordt te zijn verricht overeenkomstig genoemd lid, niet getransfereerd zal worden dan indien zij inderdaad ontvangen is door genoemde Centrale Bank, uiterlijk op het tijdstip van de transfer;    

b. dat de gestorte bedragen, zolang zij niet getransfereerd worden, moratoire interesse, overeenkomstig Artikel 10, zullen dragen, welke moratoire interesse getransfereerd zal worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van genoemd artikel.    

### Artikel  7  

####Transferschema

a.  Teneinde de afwikkeling van de schulden als bedoeld in de onderhavige Overeenkomst te verzekeren, zal de Turkse Regering, in de periode van 12 jaar volgend op de ondertekening van die Overeenkomst, elk jaar zorg dragen voor de transfer, in de geëigende valuta's, van een bedrag (hieronder genoemd „annuïteit”) dat bepaald en getransfereerd zal worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Artikel. Bovendien zal de Turkse Regering zorg dragen voor de transfer van moratoire interesse of van contractuele moratoire interesse al naar gelang het geval dat zich voordoet, zoals zulks is voorzien in Artikel 10.   
b.  Gedurende de eerste zes jaren van deze periode zal het totaal bedrag der getransfereerde annuïteiten, met inbegrip van de transfers terzake van schulden aan crediteuren in de Verenigde Staten (welk totaal bedrag hieronder genoemd wordt het „totaal bedrag der annuïteiten”): 

i. voor de eerste vijf jaren van die periode gelijk zijn aan successievelijk 15 miljoen, 20 miljoen, 25 miljoen, 30 miljoen en 35 miljoen US dollars per jaar;  

ii. voor het zesde jaar van die periode gelijk zijn aan het zevende gedeelte van het totaal bedrag der op 31 december 1963 in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen ten gunste van alle crediteurlanden.     
c.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van lid *e* zal, gedurende elk van de eerste zes jaren van die periode, het totaal bedrag van de getransfereerde annuïteiten verdeeld worden onder de crediteurlanden overeenkomstig de verhouding van de in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen ten gunste van elk crediteurland op de referentiedatum en het totaal bedrag van de in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen ten gunste van alle crediteurlanden op dezelfde datum, op voorwaarde dat: 

i. de referentiedatum zal zijn 5 augustus 1958 voor de eerste twee jaren van die periode, 31 december 1960 voor het derde en het vierde jaar, en 31 december 1962 voor het vijfde en zesde jaar;  

ii. de getransfereerde annuïteiten voor de eerste twee jaren van die periode zullen worden berekend overeenkomstig de tabel vervat in Bijlage I bij de onderhavige Overeenkomst;  

iii. op basis van de verdeling tussen de crediteurlanden de stortingen ten gunste van crediteuren in de Verenigde Staten, voor het derde, vierde en vijfde jaar onderscheidenlijk 13,939 %, 14,206 % en 14,314 % zullen bedragen van het totale bedrag der getransfereerde annuïteiten aan alle crediteurlanden, en, voor het zesde jaar, gelijk zullen zijn aan een zevende gedeelte van het totaal bedrag der gestorte bedragen in afwachting van transfer ten gunste van crediteuren in de Verenigde Staten op 31 december 1963. Deze regeling zal geen invloed hebben op het totaal bedrag der getransfereerde annuïteiten, voorzien in lid *b.*     
d.  

i. Het totaal bedrag der in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen op één van die referentiedata zal berekend worden in US dollars op basis van de pariteiten tussen de geëigende valuta's en de US dollar op de betreffende referentiedatum. De aan elk crediteurland getransfereerde annuïteit zal worden uitgedrukt in de geëigende valuta's op basis van de pariteiten toegepast bij de voorafgaande berekening van het totaal bedrag der in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen. Desniettegenstaande zullen de berekeningen betreffende de twee eerste getransfereerde annuïteiten gemaakt worden op basis van de pariteiten geldend op de datum van de ondertekening van de onderhavige overeenkomst.  

ii. Voor wat betreft de onderhavige Overeenkomst zal de pariteit tussen de geëigende valuta en de US dollar die zijn, die gedeclareerd is bij het Internationale Monetaire Fonds op de desbetreffende referentiedatum. Indien een dergelijke pariteit niet bestaat zal gebruik worden gemaakt van de officiële pariteit van de US dollar in het betrokken land of van de pariteit berekend op basis van het wettelijke fijn-goudgehalte van de betrokken valuta en van de pariteit welke gedeclareerd is bij het Internationale Monetaire Fonds tussen het goud en de US dollar op de desbetreffende referentiedatum.     
e.  Voor zover zulks nodig is voor de afwikkeling der schulden aan crediteuren woonachtig in Luxemburg, Noorwegen, Portugal en, voorzover het annuïteiten betreft betrekking hebbend op het derde jaar van die periode, in Denemarken, zal de Turkse Regering gedurende de eerste drie jaren van die periode zorg dragen voor jaarlijkse overmakingen naar elk van die crediteurlanden die, in totaal, 2 % zullen vertegenwoordigen van het totaal bedrag der getransfereerde annuïteiten gedurende het overeenkomstige jaar.   
f.  Voor de zes laatste jaren van die periode zullen de aan elk crediteurland getransfereerde annuïteiten achtereenvolgens gelijk zijn aan een zesde, een vijfde, een vierde, een derde, de helft en aan het restant van het totaal bedrag der in afwachting van transfer naar dat land gestorte bedragen, op 31 december van het jaar voorafgaande aan dat waarin de overeenkomstige annuïteit getransfereerd wordt.   
g.  De Turkse Regering zal iedere annuïteit, overeenkomstig de lijsten bedoeld in lid *a* van Artikel 8, in vier gelijke termijnen transfereren op 30 juni, 30 september, 31 december en 31 maart van elk jaar, mits: 

i. in de loop van het eerste jaar de termijnen zullen worden getransfereerd niet later dan onderscheidenlijk op 31 juli, 31 oktober, 31 december 1959 en 31 maart 1960;  

ii. het bedrag te transfereren overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit lid, verminderd zal worden met het bedrag van iedere storting waarvan de tegenwaarde is aangewend in Turkije krachtens Artikel 9, en dat getransfereerd had moeten worden in de loop van het overeenkomstige jaar.     

### Artikel  8  

####Uitvoering van het transferschema

a.  De bevoegde Turkse autoriteiten zullen periodiek, in overleg met de bevoegde instelling van elk crediteurland, lijsten opstellen, teneinde de crediteuren in het betrokken land aan te wijzen ten gunste van wie de bevoegde instelling van Turkije de transfers zal verrichten.   
b.  De in het voorafgaande lid bedoelde lijsten zullen worden opgesteld in de rangorde van afwikkeling, in onderling overleg overeengekomen tussen de Turkse Regering en de belanghebbende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, en zullen prioriteit verlenen voor betalingen aan iedere crediteur wiens totaal bedrag aan vorderingen een bepaald onderling overeengekomen bedrag niet overtreft. De rangorde van de afwikkeling kan later in onderling overleg worden gewijzigd.   
c.  Teneinde de transfer ten gunste van de crediteuren gespecificeerd in de lijsten voorzien in de voorafgaande leden, te bewerkstelligen zal de bevoegde instelling van Turkije, door tussenkomst van de bevoegde instelling van het betrokken crediteurland, een betalingsopdracht toezenden ten gunste van ieder dier crediteuren, daarbij rekening houdend met de bepalingen van Artikel 10, en in overeenstemming met de kennisgeving overeenkomstig de leden *c* en *d* van Artikel 5.   

### Artikel  9  

####Aanwending van gelden in Turkije

a.  Op voorwaarde dat hij daartoe behoorlijk gemachtigd is door de Turkse autoriteiten en, zonodig, onder voorbehoud van de deviezenbepalingen van het betrokken crediteurland, mag een crediteur het geheel of een gedeelte van een in afwachting van transfer gestort en aan hem verschuldigd bedrag, aanwenden in Turkse valuta voor het voor eigen rekening doen van investeringen of andere uitgaven in Turkije.   
b.  In de mate waarin het aangewend zal worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het voorgaande lid zal het in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedrag wederom omgezet worden in Turkse valuta tegen de wisselkoers die op de datum van omzetting in Turkije geldt voor transacties van dezelfde soort die worden uitgevoerd door middel van nieuwe overmakingen in vreemde valuta.   

### Artikel  10  

####Moratoire interesse

a.  De Turkse Regering zal aan de crediteur een moratoire interesse betalen van 3 % per jaar voor ieder in afwachting van transfer gestort bedrag mits het gestorte bedrag niet aangewend is in Turkije krachtens Artikel 9.   
b.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het voorgaande lid zal geen moratoire interesse worden betaald, indien, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het betrokken, door de Turkse autoriteiten goedgekeurde contract, de debiteur zich zal hebben verbonden om de crediteur rente te betalen (in de onderhavige Overeenkomst genoemd contractuele moratoire interesse) van de datum waarop de betaling opeisbaar is af tot aan de uitvoering van de transfer. De stortingen uit hoofde van contractuele moratoire interesse bij de Centrale Bank van Turkije verricht, zullen: 

i. worden berekend overeenkomstig de beginselen uiteengezet in lid *a*, sub *iii*, van Artikel 5 en worden getransfereerd aan de belanghebbende crediteur overeenkomstig dit Artikel en de beginselen uiteengezet in lid *a*, sub *ii*, van Artikel 6;  

ii. worden geacht moratoire interesse te zijn voor wat betreft de transfer voorzien in de leden *d* en *e.*     
c.  Moratoire interesse zal moeten worden betaald vanaf de datum van ondertekening van de onderhavige Overeenkomst, of vanaf de datum waarop de betaling opeisbaar is, indien deze tweede datum ligt na de eerste, tot aan de verrichting van de transfer van het gestorte bedrag of tot aan de aanwending ervan krachtens Artikel 9. De moratoire interesse zal worden bepaald en getransfereerd in de geëigende valuta.   
d.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in lid *e* zal de moratoire interesse worden betaald en getransfereerd aan de belanghebbende crediteur op 31 december van elk jaar, met dien verstande echter dat indien de hoofdsom waarop die rente betrekking heeft getransfereerd wordt, de moratoire interesse die uit dien hoofde verschuldigd blijft, gelijktijdig zal worden getransfereerd.   
e.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van lid *d* kan moratoire interesse die betrekking heeft op in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen, en welke ingevolge dat lid opeisbaar is op 31 december 1959, later getransfereerd worden, op voorwaarde dat de transfer zo spoedig mogelijk plaatsvindt en in elk geval vóór 1 januari 1961. Indien de rente wordt getransfereerd op enigerlei datum na 31 december 1959 zal het totaal bedrag van de tot die datum betaalbare rente, overeenkomstig lid *c,* gelijktijdig betaald en getransfereerd worden.   

### Artikel  11  

####Vroegere amortisatie-overeenkomsten

a.  Vroeger door de Turkse Regering met enige andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij terzake van de amortisatie van Turkse buitenlandse handelsschulden gesloten bilaterale overeenkomsten, evenals daarop betrekking hebbende bepalingen van andere overeenkomsten tussen de Turkse Regering en enige andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, zullen geen toepassing meer vinden vanaf de datum der ondertekening van de onderhavige Overeenkomst en zullen ingetrokken worden op de datum van inwerkingtreding van de onderhavige Overeenkomst door de bilaterale overeenkomsten die gesloten zullen worden ingevolge Artikel 13 van de onderhavige Overeenkomst.   
b.  Bij het intrekken van de bedoelde overeenkomsten of bepalingen zullen de betrokken partijen bepalen dat, wat betreft enigerlei rekening geopend ten name van de Centrale Bank van de Turkse Republiek, door de bevoegde instelling van het crediteurland ter uitvoering van de bedoelde bilaterale overeenkomsten of bepalingen: 

i. bedragen waarvoor genoemde Centrale Bank gecrediteerd is vóór 5 augustus 1958, zullen worden aangewend als voorzien in de bilaterale overeenkomst of de desbetreffende bepalingen;  

ii. bedragen waarvoor genoemde Centrale Bank is gecrediteerd vanaf die datum ter beschikking zullen worden gesteld van genoemde Centrale Bank.     

### Artikel  12  

####Centrale Bank van de Turkse Republiek

Bij de uitvoering van de bepalingen van de onderhavige Overeenkomst zal de Centrale Bank van de Turkse Republiek handelen als agent van de Turkse Regering en zal zij in geen geval enigerlei verplichting krijgen uit hoofde van de onderhavige Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  13  

####Bilaterale overeenkomsten

a.  Bilaterale overeenkomsten betreffende de regels van technische aard ter toepassing van de onderhavige Overeenkomst zullen worden gesloten tussen de Turkse Regering en elke andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Deze bilaterale overeenkomsten zullen tevens bepalingen bevatten met betrekking tot het vervallen van iedere vroegere amortisatie-overeenkomst en van alle daarop betrekking hebbende bepalingen, overeenkomstig Artikel 11 van de onderhavige Overeenkomst.   
b.  De bilaterale overeenkomsten moeten in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van de onderhavige Overeenkomst. Ingeval van strijdigheid tussen de bepalingen van de onderhavige Overeenkomst en de bepalingen van een bilaterale overeenkomst zullen de bepalingen van de onderhavige Overeenkomst prevaleren. Echter zullen de bepalingen van de bilaterale overeenkomst tussen de Turkse Regering en de Italiaanse Regering, verband houdend met de speciale regelingen welke door de Italiaanse autoriteiten worden overwogen met het oog op de toepassing van de onderhavige Overeenkomst op crediteuren woonachtig in Italië, en die voortvloeien uit de eventuele substitutie van bedoelde crediteuren door een instelling die door bedoelde autoriteiten zal worden aangewezen in de bilaterale overeenkomst, niet beschouwd worden als strijdig met de bepalingen van de onderhavige Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  14  

####Uitwisseling van gegevens

a.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen onderling de teksten van de bilaterale overeenkomsten uitwisselen, evenals ook alle gegevens die noodzakelijk zijn voor een goede uitvoering van de onderhavige Overeenkomst. Deze gegevens zullen speciaal de volgende zijn: 

i. zo spoedig mogelijk en in ieder geval vóór 1 januari 1961 op te stellen staten, vermeldende de totaal bedragen der in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen, op 5 augustus 1958 en op de datum van de ondertekening van de onderhavige overeenkomst;  

ii. aan het begin van elk volgend kalenderjaar op te stellen staten, vermeldende het totaal bedrag der in afwachting van transfer gestorte bedragen op 31 december van het voorgaande jaar;

c.  De staten, voorzien in de alinea's *i* en *ii* van lid *a* zullen vooraf door de bevoegde, door de Turkse Regering aangewezen instelling ter verificatie worden voorgelegd aan de bevoegde instelling voor dit doel aangewezen door elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, welke de bevoegde Turkse instelling in kennis zal stellen van het resultaat van het onderzoek verricht met het oog op die verificatie.
