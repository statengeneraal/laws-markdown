c. aanwezig zijn bij elk onderzoek door de aangezochte administratie dat voor de verzoekende administratie van belang is in haar douanegebied; en  

d. het resultaat van een onder c bedoeld onderzoek, alsmede alle andere informatie mededelen aan hun douane-administratie.     
2.  Wanneer ambtenaren van de verzoekende administratie onder de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde omstandigheden aanwezig zijn op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, moeten zij te allen tijde in staat zijn hun ambtelijke hoedanigheid aan te tonen.   
3.  De ambtenaren van de verzoekende administratie krijgen gedurende hun verblijf op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij de bescherming en bijstand van de aangezochte administratie die beschikbaar zijn ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Onverminderd deze bepaling en voor zover verenigbaar met toepasselijke immuniteiten, zijn de ambtenaren verantwoordelijk voor de strafbare feiten die zij eventueel begaan.

### HOOFDSTUK  IX  

####Het vertrouwelijke karakter van informatie

### Artikel  15  

1.  Alle in het kader van administratieve bijstand uit hoofde van dit Verdrag ontvangen informatie mag slechts voor de doeleinden van dit Verdrag en uitsluitend door de douane-administraties worden gebruikt. Het gebruik van de informatie voor andere doeleinden of door andere autoriteiten is onderworpen aan de uitdrukkelijke goedkeuring van de douane-autoriteit die deze informatie verstrekt.   
2.  Wanneer dit in de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij die de informatie verstrekt wordt bepaald, mag geen enkele inlichting die is verstrekt in het kader van administratieve bijstand uit hoofde van dit Verdrag worden gebruikt als bewijs in het kader van strafvervolgingen op het grondgebied van de ontvangende Verdragsluitende Partij zonder voorafgaande toestemming van het openbaar ministerie of de rechterlijke autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partij die de informatie verstrekt.   
3.  Het eerste lid vormt geen belemmering voor de bekendmaking van de ontvangen informatie in verband met een strafvervolging, wanneer in de wetgeving van de ontvangende Verdragsluitende Partij voor haar douane-administratie de verplichting is opgenomen aldus te handelen. De douane-administratie die de informatie verstrekt wordt vooraf in kennis gesteld van de voorgenomen bekendmaking.   
4.  Voor alle uit hoofde van dit Verdrag ontvangen informatie gelden dezelfde bescherming en vertrouwelijkheid als die welke voor soortgelijke informatie gelden krachtens de nationale wet- en regelgeving die van toepassing is op de onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partij op wier grondgebied deze wordt ontvangen, ongeacht nationaliteit, staatsburgerschap of verblijfplaats van de betrokken personen.   
5.  Ten aanzien van persoonsgegevens geldt dat deze niet worden uitgewisseld, wanneer op redelijke gronden kan worden aangenomen dat de overdracht of de wijze waarop de toegezonden gegevens worden gebruikt in strijd zou zijn met de fundamentele rechtsbeginselen van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen, of dat deze slechts worden uitgewisseld indien wordt voldaan aan bepaalde voorwaarden of eisen. De ontvangende douane-administratie informeert op verzoek de verstrekkende douane-administratie over het gebruik dat wordt gemaakt van de verstrekte persoonsgegevens en over de bereikte resultaten.   
6.  Dit artikel laat onverlet de verplichtingen van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden op grond van de wetgeving van de Europese Unie om informatie te verstrekken aan de Europese Commissie of de douane-administraties van de Lidstaten van de Europese Unie. De douanedienst van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika wordt in kennis gesteld van elk voornemen tot overdracht van dergelijke informatie.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  Indien uit hoofde van dit Verdrag persoonsgegevens worden uitgewisseld, zijn de nationale wettelijke en administratieve bepalingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen van toepassing, die een mate van gegevensbescherming waarborgen die ten minste gelijk is aan die welke wordt omschreven in de grondbeginselen opgenomen in de Bijlage bij dit Verdrag, die een integrerend deel van dit Verdrag uitmaakt. De douane-administraties stellen elkaar in het bezit van de meest recente tekst van de desbetreffende bepalingen.   
2.  De douane-administraties informeren elkaar over elke wijziging in hun wetgeving inzake gegevensbescherming die na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag tot stand komt. Zij wijzen in het bijzonder op wijzigingen die tot gevolg zouden hebben dat hun bepalingen niet meer in overeenstemming zijn met de mate van gegevensbescherming omschreven in de grondbeginselen opgenomen in de Bijlage bij dit Verdrag.   

### HOOFDSTUK  X  

####Ontheffing

### Artikel  17  

1.  De aangezochte administratie is niet verplicht de in dit Verdrag bedoelde bijstand te verlenen indien deze de openbare orde of enig ander wezenlijk belang van de aangezochte Verdragsluitende Partij zou kunnen schaden. De verlening van bijstand kan afhankelijk worden gesteld van het voldoen aan bepaalde voorwaarden of eisen.   
2.  Indien de verzoekende administratie niet in staat is een soortgelijk verzoek van de aangezochte administratie in te willigen, wijst zij daarop in haar verzoek. Inwilliging van een dergelijk verzoek wordt overgelaten aan het oordeel van de aangezochte administratie.   
3.  De bijstand kan door de aangezochte administratie worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat hiermee een lopend onderzoek of een lopende vervolging of procedure wordt doorkruist. In een dergelijk geval pleegt de aangezochte administratie overleg met de verzoekende administratie om te bepalen of de bijstand kan worden verleend onder de voorwaarden of omstandigheden die de aangezochte administratie verlangt.   
4.  Wanneer de bijstand wordt geweigerd of uitgesteld, dienen redenen voor de weigering of het uitstel te worden gegeven.   

### HOOFDSTUK  XI  

####Kosten

### Artikel  18  

1.  De douane-administraties zien af van alle vorderingen tot vergoeding van ter uitvoering van dit Verdrag gemaakte kosten, met uitzondering van bedragen en vergoedingen betaald aan deskundigen en getuigen alsook de kosten van tolken die niet in dienst zijn van de Regering, welke worden gedragen door de verzoekende administratie.   
2.  Indien met de uitvoering van het verzoek aanmerkelijke kosten van buitengewone aard zijn of zullen zijn gemoeid, plegen de Verdragsluitende Partijen overleg om de voorwaarden en omstandigheden te bepalen waaronder het verzoek zal worden uitgevoerd, alsmede de wijze waarop de kosten zullen worden gedragen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  XII  

####Uitvoering van het Verdrag

2.  De douane-administraties besluiten, binnen het kader van dit Verdrag, over nadere regelingen ter vergemakkelijking van de uitvoering van dit Verdrag.

### Bijlage  

####Grondbeginselen voor gegevensbescherming

Elke douane-administratie houdt zich in de mate die verenigbaar is met de toepasselijke nationale wettelijke en administratieve bepalingen aan de minimumbeginselen die gelijkwaardig zijn aan het hiernavolgende:  

### 1  

Persoonsgegevens die langs geautomatiseerde weg worden verwerkt, dienen: 

a. op eerlijke en rechtmatige wijze te worden verkregen en verwerkt;  

b. te worden opgeslagen voor bepaalde en legitieme doeleinden, en niet te worden gebruikt op een wijze die onverenigbaar is met die doeleinden;  

c. toereikend, ter zake dienend en niet te uitvoerig te zijn in verhouding tot de doeleinden waarvoor zij worden opgeslagen;  

d. nauwkeurig te zijn en, zo nodig, te worden bijgewerkt;  

e. te worden bewaard in een zodanige vorm dat de betrokkene hierdoor niet langer te identificeren is dan strikt noodzakelijk is voor het doel waarvoor de gegevens zijn opgeslagen.    

### 2  

Persoonsgegevens waaruit ras, politieke gezindheid of godsdienst dan wel andere levensovertuigingen blijken, alsmede die welke betrekking hebben op gezondheid of seksuele geaardheid, mogen niet langs geautomatiseerde weg worden verwerkt, tenzij het nationale recht daartoe machtiging geeft onder passende waarborgen. Hetzelfde geldt voor persoonsgegevens betreffende strafrechtelijke veroordelingen.  

### 3  

Er dienen passende beveiligingsmaatregelen te worden getroffen om in geautomatiseerde gegevensbestanden opgeslagen persoonsgegevens te beschermen tegen ongeoorloofde vernietiging of toevallig verlies en ongeoorloofde toegang, wijziging of verspreiding.  

### 4  

Passende maatregelen dienen te worden genomen om personen in staat te stellen: 

a. kennis te nemen van het bestaan van een geautomatiseerd bestand met persoonsgegevens, de voornaamste doeleinden hiervan, alsmede van de identiteit en verblijfplaats van de beheerder van het bestand;  

b. met redelijke tussenpozen en zonder overmatige vertraging of kosten uitsluitsel te verkrijgen over de vraag of op hen betrekking hebbende persoonsgegevens in het geautomatiseerde bestand zijn opgeslagen en kennis te nemen van die gegevens in een begrijpelijke vorm;  

c. in voorkomend geval die gegevens te doen verbeteren of verwijderen, indien deze zijn verwerkt in strijd met de bepalingen van het nationale recht waarmee uitvoering wordt gegeven aan de grondbeginselen neergelegd in de grondbeginselen 1 en 2 van deze Bijlage;  

d. over een rechtsmiddel te beschikken, indien geen gevolg wordt gegeven aan een verzoek om kennisgeving of, naargelang het geval, om kennisgeving, verbetering of verwijdering als bedoeld in de letters b en c van dit beginsel.    

### 5  

1.  Op het in de grondbeginselen 1, 2 en 4 van deze Bijlage bepaalde is geen uitzondering toegestaan, tenzij deze binnen de in dit beginsel gestelde grenzen valt.   
2.  Van het in de grondbeginselen 1, 2 en 4 van deze Bijlage bepaalde kan worden afgeweken, indien de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij in een dergelijke afwijking voorziet en het een maatregel betreft die in een democratische samenleving noodzakelijk is ten behoeve van: 

a. de bescherming van de staatsveiligheid, de openbare veiligheid, de monetaire belangen van de Staat of de criminaliteitsbestrijding; en  

b. de bescherming van de betrokkene of van de rechten en vrijheden van anderen.     
3.  De uitoefening van de in beginsel 4, letters b, c en d, van deze Bijlage genoemde rechten kan bij wet worden beperkt met betrekking tot geautomatiseerde bestanden met persoonsgegevens die voor statistische doeleinden of voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek worden gebruikt, indien er kennelijk geen risico bestaat dat inbreuk zal worden gemaakt op de persoonlijke levenssfeer van de betrokkenen.   

### 6  

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij verbindt zich ertoe passende sancties en rechtsmiddelen in te voeren ter zake van schending van bepalingen van het nationale recht waarmee uitvoering wordt gegeven aan de in deze Bijlage neergelegde grondbeginselen.  

### 7  

Het in deze Bijlage bepaalde mag niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat daaruit een beperking of aantasting voortvloeit van de bevoegdheid van een Verdragsluitende Partij om aan betrokkenen een ruimere mate van bescherming toe te kennen dan in deze Bijlage is vastgelegd.
