### Article  8  

If the investments of a national of the one Contracting Party are insured against non-commercial risks or otherwise give rise to payment of indemnification in respect of such investments under a system established by law, regulation or government contract any subrogation of the insurer or re-insurer or Agency designated by the one Contracting Party to the rights of the said national pursuant to the terms of such insurance or under any other indemnity given shall be recognised by the other Contracting Party.

c. omvat de term „grondgebied" mede de zeegebieden grenzend aan de kust van de betrokken Staat, voor zover die Staat overeenkomstig het internationale recht soevereine rechten of rechtsmacht in deze gebieden uitoefent.    

### Artikel  2  

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij bevordert, binnen het kader van haar wetten en voorschriften, de economische samenwerking door middel van de bescherming op haar grondgebied van investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.

### Artikel  3  

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt een eerlijke en rechtvaardige behandeling van de investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en belemmert niet, door onredelijke of discriminatoire maatregelen, de werking, het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik, het genot of de vervreemding daarvan door deze onderdanen. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan die investeringen volledige zekerheid en bescherming toe.   
2.  In het bijzonder kent elke Verdragsluitende Partij aan dergelijke investeringen een behandeling toe die in elk geval niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan investeringen van haar eigen onderdanen of aan investeringen van onderdanen van een derde Staat, naar gelang van wat het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdaan.

### Artikel  6

a. de maatregelen worden genomen in het algemeen belang en met inachtneming van een behoorlijke rechtsgang;  

b. de maatregelen zijn niet discriminatoir of in strijd met enige verbintenis die de Verdragsluitende Partij die deze maatregelen neemt, is aangegaan;  

c. de maatregelen gaan vergezeld van een billijke schadeloosstelling.

### Artikel  7

### Artikel  8  

Indien de investeringen van een onderdaan van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij verzekerd zijn tegen niet-commerciële risico's of anderszins aanleiding geven tot de betaling van schadevergoeding ter zake van die investeringen krachtens een bij wet, voorschrift of overheidscontract ingesteld stelsel, wordt de subrogatie van de verzekeraar of de herverzekeraar of de door de ene Verdragsluitende Partij aangewezen instantie in de rechten van de bedoelde onderdaan, ingevolge de voorwaarden van deze verzekering of krachtens een andere gegeven schadeloosstelling, door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij erkend.  

### Artikel  9  

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij stemt ermee in geschillen die ontstaan tussen die Verdragsluitende Partij en een onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij betreffende een investering van die onderdaan op het grondgebied van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij die zij niet in der minne kunnen schikken binnen drie maanden na de datum van het verzoek tot minnelijke schikking, voor te leggen aan het Internationale Centrum voor de Beslechting van Investeringsgeschillen ter beslechting door bemiddeling of arbitrage krachtens het Verdrag inzake de beslechting van investeringsgeschillen tussen Staten en onderdanen van andere Staten, dat op 18 maart 1965 te Washington D.C. werd opengesteld voor ondertekening. Een rechtspersoon die onderdaan is van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij en die, voordat een dergelijk geschil ontstaat, onder toezicht staat van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt in overeenstemming met artikel 25, tweede lid, letter b, van het Verdrag voor de toepassing van het Verdrag behandeld als onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.  

### Artikel  10  

1.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag zijn, vanaf de datum waarop dit in werking treedt, ook van toepassing op bestaande investeringen die vóór die datum zijn gedaan.   
2.  Investeerders als bedoeld in artikel 1, letter b, onder iii, kunnen geen vordering indienen krachtens dit Verdrag, indien met betrekking tot dezelfde aangelegenheid een beroep is gedaan op de bepalingen van een ander verdrag inzake de bescherming van investeringen.   

### Artikel  11  

Elk van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aan de andere Partij voorstellen overleg te plegen over een aangelegenheid betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag. De andere Verdragsluitende Partij neemt dit voorstel in welwillende overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor een dergelijk overleg.  

### Artikel  12  

1.  Enig geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen een termijn van drie maanden na het ontstaan van het geschil langs diplomatieke weg kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij benoemt één scheidsman en de aldus benoemde scheidsmannen benoemen te zamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een der Verdragsluitende Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  Indien één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen nalaat haar scheidsman te benoemen en indien zij geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij binnen twee maanden tot deze benoeming over te gaan, kan de laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
3.  Indien de beide scheidsmannen niet binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming tot overeenstemming kunnen geraken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, kan elk der Verdragsluitende Partijen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
4.  Indien in de in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de Vice-President verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de Vice-President verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat het hoogst in anciënniteit is, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van één der Verdragsluitende Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van eerbiediging van het recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elk stadium van het geding een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono, indien de Verdragsluitende Partijen daarmee instemmen.   
6.  Tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
7.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de Verdragsluitende Partijen.   

### Artikel  13  

Wat betreft het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden is dit Verdrag van toepassing op het deel van het Rijk in Europa, de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking op de eerste dag van de tweede maand die volgt op de datum waarop de Verdragsluitende Partijen elkaar schriftelijk hebben medegedeeld dat aan de in hun onderscheiden landen grondwettelijk vereiste procedures is voldaan, en blijft van kracht voor een tijdvak van vijftien jaar.   
2.  Tenzij ten minste zes maanden voor de datum van het verstrijken van de geldigheidsduur door een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen schriftelijk mededeling van beëindiging is gedaan, wordt dit Verdrag telkens stilzwijgend verlengd voor een tijdvak van tien jaar, waarbij elke Verdragsluitende Partij zich het recht voorbehoudt dit Verdrag te beëindigen met inachtneming van een opzegtermijn van ten minste zes maanden voor de datum van het verstrijken van de lopende termijn van geldigheid.   
3.  Ten aanzien van investeringen die zijn gedaan voor de datum van beëindiging van dit Verdrag, blijven de voorgaande artikelen van kracht gedurende een tijdvak van vijftien jaar vanaf die datum.   
4.  Met inachtneming van de in het tweede lid van dit artikel genoemde termijn is de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden gerechtigd de toepassing van dit Verdrag ten aanzien van een deel van het Koninkrijk afzonderlijk te beëindigen.   
5.  Bij de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag wordt de Overeenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Socialistische Federatieve Republiek Joegoslavië inzake de bescherming van investeringen, ondertekend op 16 februari 1976, vervangen door dit Verdrag voor zover deze het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Slovenië betreft.

####Protocol

Bij de ondertekening van het Verdrag tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Regering van de Republiek Slovenië inzake de bevordering en de wederzijdse bescherming van investeringen hebben de bevoegde ondertekenaars bovendien overeenstemming bereikt over de volgende bepalingen, die als onderdeel van het Verdrag worden beschouwd:    Met betrekking tot artikel 1, letter b), onder iii) van dit Verdrag: Onder niet-rechtstreeks toezicht op een investering wordt verstaan feitelijk toezicht, te bepalen na een onderzoek betreffende de feitelijke omstandigheden per geval. Bij elk zodanig onderzoek dienen alle relevante factoren in overweging te worden genomen, met inbegrip van: 

a. het financiële belang van de investeerder, waaronder belang in het vermogen, in de investering;  

b. de mogelijkheid van de investeerder om wezenlijke invloed uit te oefenen op het beheer en de werking van de investering; en  

c. de mogelijkheid van de investeerder om wezenlijke invloed uit te oefenen op de selectie van leden van de raad van bestuur of enig ander bestuurslichaam.   In geval van twijfel omtrent de vraag of een investeerder al dan niet rechtstreeks toezicht heeft op een investering, rust de bewijslast daarvan op de investeerder die stelt dat hij dit toezicht heeft.
