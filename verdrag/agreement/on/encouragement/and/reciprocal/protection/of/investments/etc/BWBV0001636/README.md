### Artikel  2  

####Bevordering en bescherming van investeringen

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij bevordert, binnen het kader van haar wetten en voorschriften, de economische samenwerking door middel van de bescherming op haar grondgebied van investeringen van investeerders van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Met inachtneming van haar recht de door haar wetten of voorschriften verleende bevoegdheden uit te oefenen, staat elke Verdragsluitende Partij dergelijke investeringen toe.  

### Artikel  3  

####Behandeling van investeringen

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt een eerlijke en rechtvaardige behandeling van de investeringen van investeerders van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en belemmert niet, door onredelijke of discriminatoire maatregelen, de werking, het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik, het genot of de vervreemding daarvan door die investeerders. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan die investeringen non-discriminatoire fysieke zekerheid en bescherming toe.   
2.  In het bijzonder kent elke Verdragsluitende Partij aan die investeringen een behandeling toe die in ieder geval niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan investeringen van haar eigen investeerders of aan investeringen van investeerders van een derde staat, naar gelang van welke het gunstigst is voor de betrokken investeerder.   
3.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij investeerders van een derde staat bijzondere voordelen heeft toegekend uit hoofde van overeenkomsten tot oprichting van douane-unies, economische unies, monetaire unies of soortgelijke instellingen, dan wel op grond van interim-overeenkomsten die tot dergelijke unies of instellingen leiden, is die Verdragsluitende Partij niet verplicht zodanige voordelen toe te kennen aan investeerders van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.

Afhankelijk van de versterking van de capaciteit van lokale bedrijven, zal de Verenigde Republiek Tanzania dergelijke speciale stimuleringsmaatregelen met voortvarendheid opheffen.   

### Artikel  4  

####Belastingen en fiscale aangelegenheden

Hierbij wordt evenwel geen rekening gehouden met bijzondere belastingvoordelen door die Partij toegekend: 

a. krachtens een verdrag ter vermijding van dubbele belasting; of  

b. uit hoofde van haar deelneming aan een douane-unie, economische unie of soortgelijke instelling; of

### Artikel  8

### Artikel  11  

####Overleg

Elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aan de andere Partij voorstellen overleg te plegen over een aangelegenheid betreffende de interpretatie of toepassing van het Verdrag. De andere Partij neemt dit voorstel in welwillende overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor dergelijk overleg.  

### Artikel  12  

####Geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen

1.  Enig geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de interpretatie of toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen zes maanden langs diplomatieke weg kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van één van beide Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Partij benoemt een scheidsman en de twee aldus benoemde scheidslieden benoemen tezamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een der Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  Indien één van beide Partijen nalaat haar scheidsman te benoemen en indien zij binnen twee maanden geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere Partij tot deze benoeming over te gaan, kan de laatstgenoemde Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
3.  Indien de beide scheidslieden binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, kan elk der Partijen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
4.  Indien in de in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de Vice-President verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de Vice-President verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van één van beide Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat de hoogste anciënniteit heeft, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van één van beide Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van eerbiediging van het recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elk stadium van het geding een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de Partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono, indien de Partijen dit overeenkomen.   
6.  Tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
7.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de Partijen.
