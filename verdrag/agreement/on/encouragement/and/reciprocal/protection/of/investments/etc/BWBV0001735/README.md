### Artikel  1  

####Begripsomschrijvingen

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: 

a. wordt onder de term „investeringen" verstaan: alle soorten vermogensbestanddelen en in het bijzonder, doch niet uitsluitend:

### Artikel  2  

####Toelating van investeringen

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij bevordert, binnen het kader van haar wetten en voorschriften, de economische samenwerking door middel van de bevordering en bescherming op haar grondgebied van investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Met inachtneming van het recht van elke Verdragsluitende Partij de door haar wetten of voorschriften verleende bevoegdheden uit te oefenen, laat elke Verdragsluitende Partij dergelijke investeringen toe.  

### Artikel  3  

####Behandeling van investeringen

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt een eerlijke en rechtvaardige behandeling van de investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en belemmert niet, door onredelijke of discriminatoire maatregelen, de werking, het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik, het genot of de vervreemding daarvan door die onderdanen. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan die investeringen volledige zekerheid en bescherming toe.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan die investeringen een behandeling toe die in ieder geval niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan investeringen van haar eigen onderdanen of aan investeringen van onderdanen van een derde staat, naar gelang van welke het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdaan.   
3.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij onderdanen van een derde staat bijzondere voordelen heeft toegekend uit hoofde van overeenkomsten tot oprichting van douane-unies, economische unies, monetaire unies of soortgelijke instellingen, dan wel op grond van interimovereenkomsten die tot dergelijke unies of instellingen leiden, is die Verdragsluitende Partij niet verplicht deze voordelen toe te kennen aan onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
4.  Indien naast dit Verdrag de wettelijke bepalingen van één van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen of verplichtingen krachtens internationaal recht die thans tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen bestaan of op een later tijdstip onderling worden aangegaan, een regeling bevatten op grond waarvan investeringen door onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij aanspraak kunnen maken op een behandeling die gunstiger is dan in dit Verdrag is voorzien, heeft een dergelijke regeling, in zoverre zij gunstiger is, voorrang boven dit Verdrag.   
5.  Om twijfel te vermijden wordt bevestigd dat het in het tweede en vierde lid voorziene beginsel van nationale behandeling van toepassing is op investeringen zodra deze officieel zijn toegelaten, via een specifieke vergunning, indien van toepassing.   

### Artikel  4  

####Belastingen en andere fiscale aangelegenheden

Met betrekking tot belastingen, heffingen, lasten en fiscale verminderingen en vrijstellingen van belasting kent iedere Verdragsluitende Partij aan onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij die zich op haar grondgebied met economische activiteiten bezighouden, een behandeling toe die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan haar eigen onderdanen of aan die van een derde staat die zich in dezelfde omstandigheden bevinden, naar gelang van wat het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdanen. Hierbij wordt evenwel geen rekening gehouden met bijzondere fiscale voordelen door die Partij toegekend: 

a. krachtens een verdrag ter vermijding van dubbele belasting; of  

b. uit hoofde van haar deelneming aan een douane-unie, economische unie of soortgelijke instelling; of  

c. op basis van wederkerigheid met een derde staat.

h. betalingen uit hoofde van artikel 7.     
2.  In overeenstemming met het bepaalde in het eerste lid, dienen de bovenbedoelde overmakingen te geschieden overeenkomstig de wisselvoorschriften die van kracht zijn in de Verdragsluitende Partij op wier grondgebied de investering werd gedaan, tegen de wisselkoers op de datum van overmaking.   

### Artikel  6  

####Onteigening en nationalisering

Geen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen neemt maatregelen tot onteigening of nationalisering van investeringen van investeerders van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij of andere maatregelen van vergelijkbare aard of met overeenkomstige gevolgen, tenzij aan de volgende voorwaarden wordt voldaan: 

a. de maatregelen worden genomen in het algemeen belang en met inachtneming van een behoorlijke rechtsgang;  

b. de maatregelen zijn niet discriminatoir, en  

c. de maatregelen gaan vergezeld van een onmiddellijke, adequate en doeltreffende schadeloosstelling. Deze schadeloosstelling dient overeen te komen met de redelijke marktwaarde van de investering onmiddellijk voordat de maatregelen of op handen zijnde maatregelen openbaar zijn geworden en dient rente te omvatten tegen een gewone commerciële rentevoet vanaf de datum waarop de maatregelen werden genomen tot de datum van betaling, en dient, wil zij doeltreffend zijn voor de getroffen investeerders, zonder vertraging te worden betaald en te kunnen worden overgemaakt naar het door de betrokken investeerders aangewezen land in een vrij inwisselbare valuta.    

### Artikel  7  

####Schadeloosstelling voor schade en verliezen

Aan onderdanen van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij die verliezen lijden met betrekking tot hun investeringen op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij wegens oorlog of een ander gewapend conflict, revolutie, een nationale noodtoestand, opstand, oproer of ongeregeldheden, wordt door de laatstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij wat restitutie, schadevergoeding, schadeloosstelling of een andere regeling betreft, geen minder gunstige behandeling toegekend dan die welke die Verdragsluitende Partij toekent aan haar eigen onderdanen of aan onderdanen van een derde staat, naar gelang van wat het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdanen.  

### Artikel  8  

####Subrogatie

Indien de investeringen van een onderdaan van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij verzekerd zijn tegen niet-commerciële risico's of anderszins aanleiding geven tot de betaling van schadevergoeding ter zake van die investeringen krachtens een bij wet, voorschrift of overheidscontract ingesteld stelsel, wordt de subrogatie van de verzekeraar of de herverzekeraar of de door de ene Verdragsluitende Partij aangewezen instantie in de rechten van de bedoelde onderdaan, ingevolge de voorwaarden van deze verzekering of krachtens een andere gegeven schadeloosstelling, door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij erkend.

Geschillen die mochten ontstaan tussen een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen en een investeerder van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij betreffende een investering van die investeerder op het grondgebied van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij worden, zoveel mogelijk, in der minne geschikt tussen de betrokken partijen.   
2.  Indien het geschil niet is beslecht binnen een periode van zes maanden na de datum waarop een der partijen om minnelijke schikking heeft verzocht, wordt het geschil op verzoek van de betrokken onderdaan voorgelegd aan: 

a. het bevoegde rechtscollege van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de investering is gedaan; of

d. een internationaal scheidsgerecht ad hoc krachtens het arbitragereglement van de Commissie voor Internationaal Handelsrecht van de Verenigde Naties (UNCITRAL).     
3.  Een rechtspersoon die onderdaan is van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij en die, voordat een dergelijk geschil ontstaat, onder toezicht staat van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt in overeenstemming met artikel 25, tweede lid, letter b, van het Verdrag inzake de beslechting van investeringsgeschillen tussen staten en onderdanen van andere staten voor de toepassing van het Verdrag behandeld als een onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op investeringen, ongeacht of deze voor of na de inwerkingtreding ervan plaatsvonden, gedaan op het grondgebied van een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen. Het is echter niet van toepassing op aanspraken voortvloeiend uit gebeurtenissen die zich hebben voorgedaan vóór zijn inwerkingtreding.  

### Artikel  11  

####Overleg

Elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aan de andere Partij voorstellen overleg te plegen over een aangelegenheid betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag. De andere Partij neemt dit voorstel in welwillende overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor dergelijk overleg.  

### Artikel  12  

####Beslechting van geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen

1.  Enig geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen een redelijke termijn langs diplomatieke weg kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van een van beide Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Partij benoemt een scheidsman en de twee aldus benoemde scheidslieden benoemen tezamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een van de Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  Indien een van de Partijen verzuimt haar scheidsman te benoemen en indien zij binnen twee maanden geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere Partij tot deze benoeming over te gaan, kan de laatstgenoemde Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
3.  Indien de beide scheidslieden binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, kan elk van de Partijen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
4.  Indien in de in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de Vice-President verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de Vice-President verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat de hoogste anciënniteit heeft, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van een van beide Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van de algemeen aanvaarde beginselen van het internationale recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elk stadium van het geding een minne-lijke schikking van het geschil aan de partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono, indien de partijen dit overeenkomen.   
6.  Tenzij de partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
7.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de partijen.   

### Artikel  13  

####Territoriale toepassing

Wat het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden betreft, is dit Verdrag van toepassing op het deel van het Koninkrijk in Europa, op de Nederlandse Antillen en op Aruba, tenzij anders is bepaald in de in artikel 14, eerste lid, bedoelde mededeling.
