Een rechtspersoon die onderdaan is van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij en die, voordat een dergelijk geschil ontstaat, onder toezicht staat van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt in overeenstemming met artikel 25, tweede lid, letter b, van het Verdrag voor de toepassing van het Verdrag behandeld als onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.  

### Artikel  10  

Elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aan de andere Partij voorstellen overleg te plegen over een aangelegenheid betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag. De andere Partij neemt dit voorstel in welwillende overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor dergelijk overleg.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Enig geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen drie maanden langs diplomatieke weg kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van een van beide Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Partij benoemt een scheidsman en de twee aldus benoemde scheidslieden benoemen tezamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een der Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  Indien een van beide Partijen verzuimt haar scheidsman te benoemen en indien zij binnen twee maanden geen gevolg heeft gegeven aan het verzoek van de andere Partij tot deze benoeming over te gaan, kan de laatstgenoemde Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
3.  Indien de beide scheidslieden niet binnen twee maanden na hun benoeming overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman, kan elk der Partijen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten.   
4.  Indien in de in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de Vice-President verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de Vice-President verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat de hoogste anciënniteit heeft, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van een der Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
5.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van eerbiediging van het recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elk stadium van het geding een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de Partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono, indien de Partijen dit overeenkomen.   
6.  Tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedure vast.   
7.  Elke betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij draagt de kosten van haar eigen lid van het scheidsgerecht en van haar vertegenwoordiging in de arbitrageprocedure en de helft van de kosten van de voorzitter en de overige kosten. Het scheidsgerecht kan bij zijn beslissing evenwel bepalen dat een van de twee Verdragsluitende Partijen een groter deel van de kosten draagt.   
8.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de Partijen.   

### Artikel  12

####Protocol bij het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Bosnië-Herzegowina inzake de bevordering en de wederzijdse bescherming van investeringen

Bij de ondertekening van het Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Bosnië-Herzegowina inzake de bevordering en de wederzijdse bescherming van investeringen hebben de ondergetekende vertegenwoordigers overeenstemming bereikt over de volgende bepalingen, die een integrerend deel van het Verdrag vormen.    

####Ad artikel 1, onderdeel b., onder (iii)

Onder niet-rechtstreeks toezicht op een investering wordt verstaan feitelijk toezicht, te bepalen na onderzoek van de feitelijke omstandigheden per geval. Bij elk zodanig onderzoek dienen alle relevante factoren in overweging te worden genomen, met inbegrip van de onderdaan betreffende factoren.

b. de mogelijkheid wezenlijke invloed uit te oefenen op het beheer en de werking van de investering; en  

c. de mogelijkheid wezenlijke invloed uit te oefenen op de selectie van leden van de raad van bestuur of enig ander bestuurslichaam.   In geval van twijfel omtrent de vraag of een onderdaan al dan niet rechtstreeks toezicht uitoefent op een investering, rust de bewijslast daarvan op de onderdaan die stelt dat hij dit toezicht heeft.  

####Ad artikel 5

Overmakingen geschieden in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende wetgeving.
