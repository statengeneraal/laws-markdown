The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Zimbabwe, hereinafter referred to as the Contracting Parties, Desiring to strengthen their traditional ties of friendship and to extend and intensify the economic relations between them, particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1

(i) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights *in rem* in respect of every kind of asset;  

(ii) rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;  

(iii) title to money and other assets and to any performance having an economic value;  

(iv) copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, trade-marks, trade-names, know-how and goodwill;

(i) natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in accordance with its law;  

(ii) without prejudice to the provisions of (iii) hereafter, legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party;  

(iii) legal persons, wherever located, controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of that Contracting Party.

d) the term “laws" includes published administrative rules and regulations.    

### Article  2  

Either Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws, promote economic cooperation through the protection in its territory of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.

### Article  3  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals. Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection.   
2.  More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments treatment which in any case shall not be less favourable than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.   
3.  If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.   
4.  Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.   
5.  If the laws of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a provision whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such provision shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.   

### Article  4  

With respect to taxes, fees, charges and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party who are engaged in any economic activity in its territory, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State who are in the same circumstances, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union or similar institution, or on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.  

### Article  5  

The Contracting Parties shall guarantee that payments relating to an investment may be transferred.

a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;  

b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the former Contracting Party may have given;  

c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants. The genuine value of the investments shall include, but not exclusively, the net asset value thereof as certified by an independent firm of auditors.    

### Article  7  

Nationals of the one Contracting Party who suffer losses in respect of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which that Contracting Party accords to its own nationals or to nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned.  

### Article  8  

If the investments of a national of the one Contracting Party are insured against non-commercial risks or otherwise give rise to payment of indemnification in respect of such investments under a system established by law, regulation or government contract, any subrogation of the insurer or re-insurer or Agency designated by the one Contracting Party to the rights of the said national pursuant to the terms of such insurance or under any other indemnity given shall be recognized by the other Contracting Party. For this purpose, the insurer or re-insurer or Agency shall not be entitled to assert any rights other than the rights which the said national would have been entitled to assert.  

### Article  9  

1.  Any legal dispute between a Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party arising directly out of an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in dispute. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date when it is raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration.   
2.  Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit such legal dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965. A legal person which is a national of one Contracting Party and which before such a dispute arises is controlled by nationals of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the Convention, be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a national of the other Contracting Party.   
3.  The arbitral tribunal to which such legal dispute is submitted shall, unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise, decide in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party – party to the dispute – (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.   

### Article  10  

The provisions of this Agreement shall, from the date of entry into force thereof, also apply to investments which have been made before that date.  

### Article  11  

As regards the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the present Agreement shall apply to the part of the Kingdom in Europe, the Netherlands Antilles and to Aruba, unless the notification provided for in Article 14, paragraph (1) provides otherwise.  

### Article  12  

Either Contracting Party may propose to the other Party that consultations be held on any matter concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement. The other Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the proposal and shall afford adequate opportunity for such consultations.  

### Article  13  

1.  Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement which cannot be settled within a reasonable lapse of time, by means of diplomatic negotiations, shall, unless the Parties have otherwise agreed, be submitted, at the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall together agree upon a third arbitrator, who is not a national of either Party, to be appointed by the Parties as their chairman.   
2.  The arbitrators shall be appointed within two months and the chairman within three months from the date on which either Party has requested the submission to arbitration.   
3.  If the necessary appointments have not been made within the periods specified in paragraph (2) of this Article, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Party, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Party, the most senior member of the Court available who is not a national of either Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.   
4.  The tribunal shall decide on the basis of international law and any treaties in force between the Parties (including the present Agreement) and shall take into account, as may be appropriate, the relevant domestic law. Before the tribunal decides, it may at any stage of the proceedings propose to the Parties that the dispute be settled amicably. The foregoing provisions shall not prejudice the power of the tribunal to decide the dispute ex aequo et bono if the Parties so agree.   
5.  Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure.   
6.  The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on the Parties.   
7.  If any legal dispute is referred to conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Article 9 of the present Agreement, the arbitration provisions of this Article 13 shall not be involved in relation to such dispute, except where any award, decision or agreement rendered or concluded pursuant to conciliation or arbitration under the said Article 9 is not complied with.   

### Article  14  

1.  The present Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the Contracting Parties have informed each other in writing that their constitutionally required procedures have been complied with, and shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years.   
2.  Unless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least six months before the date of the expiry of its validity, the present Agreement shall be extended tacitly for periods of ten years, each Contracting Party reserving the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months before the date of expiry of the current period of validity.   
3.  In respect of investments made before the date of the termination of the present Agreement the foregoing Articles hereof shall continue to be effective for a further period of fifteen years from that date.

d. omvat de term „wetten" mede openbaar gemaakte administratieve regels en voorschriften.    

### Artikel  2  

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij bevordert, binnen het kader van haar wetten, de economische samenwerking door middel van de bescherming op haar grondgebied van investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Met inachtneming van het recht van elke Verdragsluitende Partij de door haar wetten verleende bevoegdheden uit te oefenen, staat elke Verdragsluitende Partij dergelijke investeringen toe.  

### Artikel  3  

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt een eerlijke en rechtvaardige behandeling van de investeringen van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij en belemmert niet, door onredelijke of discriminatoire maatregelen, de werking, het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik, het genot of de vervreemding daarvan door deze onderdanen. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan die investeringen volledige fysieke zekerheid en bescherming toe.   
2.  In het bijzonder kent elke Verdragsluitende Partij aan die investeringen een behandeling toe, die in ieder geval niet minder gunstig is dan die welke wordt toegekend aan investeringen van haar eigen onderdanen of aan investeringen van onderdanen van een derde Staat, naar gelang van wat het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdaan.   
3.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij onderdanen van een derde Staat bijzondere voordelen heeft toegekend uit hoofde van overeenkomsten tot oprichting van een douane-unie, economische unie, monetaire unie of soortgelijke instelling, dan wel op grond van interim-overeenkomsten die tot een zodanige unie of instelling leiden, is die Verdragsluitende Partij niet verplicht zodanige voordelen toe te kennen aan onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.

Hierbij wordt evenwel geen rekening gehouden met bijzondere belastingvoordelen door die Partij toegekend krachtens een verdrag ter vermijding van dubbele belasting, uit hoofde van haar deelneming aan een douane-unie, economische unie of soortgelijke instelling, of op basis van wederkerigheid met een derde Staat.

### Artikel  6  

Geen der Verdragsluitende Partijen onderwerpt de onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij aan maatregelen waardoor hun direct of indirect hun investeringen worden ontnomen, tenzij aan de volgende voorwaarden wordt voldaan:

b. de maatregelen zijn niet discriminatoir of in strijd met enige verbintenis die de eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij is aangegaan;  

c. de maatregelen omvatten een regeling voor de betaling van een billijke schadeloosstelling. Deze schadeloosstelling dient overeen te komen met de werkelijke waarde van de desbetreffende investeringen en dient, wil zij doeltreffend zijn voor de gerechtigden, zonder vertraging te worden betaald en te kunnen worden overgemaakt naar het door de betrokken gerechtigden aangewezen land en in de valuta van het land waarvan de gerechtigden onderdaan zijn of in een door de gerechtigden aanvaarde vrij inwisselbare valuta. De werkelijke waarde van de investeringen omvat mede, doch niet uitsluitend, de netto boekwaarde daarvan, zoals vastgesteld door een onafhankelijk accountantskantoor.    

### Artikel  7  

Aan onderdanen van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij die verliezen lijden met betrekking tot hun investeringen op het grondgebied van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij wegens oorlog of een ander gewapend conflict, revolutie, een nationale noodtoestand, opstand, oproer of ongeregeldheden, wordt door de laatstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij wat restitutie, schadevergoeding, schadeloosstelling of een andere regeling betreft, geen minder gunstige behandeling toegekend dan die welke die Verdragsluitende Partij toekent aan haar eigen onderdanen of aan onderdanen van een derde Staat, naar gelang van wat het gunstigst is voor de betrokken onderdanen.  

### Artikel  8  

Indien de investeringen van een onderdaan van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij verzekerd zijn tegen niet-commerciële risico's of anderszins aanleiding geven tot de betaling van schadevergoeding ter zake van die investeringen krachtens een bij wet, voorschrift of overheidscontract ingesteld stelsel, wordt de subrogatie van de verzekeraar of de herverzekeraar of de door de ene Verdragsluitende Partij aangewezen instantie in de rechten van de bedoelde onderdaan, ingevolge de voorwaarden van deze verzekering of krachtens een andere gegeven schadeloosstelling, door de andere Verdragsluitende Partij erkend. Hierbij is de verzekeraar, herverzekeraar of aangewezen instantie niet bevoegd andere rechten te doen gelden dan de rechten die de desbetreffende onderdaan bevoegd zou zijn te doen gelden.  

### Artikel  9  

1.  Juridische geschillen tussen een Verdragsluitende Partij en een onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij die direct ontstaan uit een investering van die onderdaan op het grondgebied van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Partij worden, voor zover mogelijk, in der minne geschikt tussen de partijen in geschil. Indien het geschil niet kan worden beslecht binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop het door een der partijen in geschil is opgebracht, wordt het, op verzoek van de betrokken onderdaan, ter beslechting door middel van conciliatie of arbitrage voorgelegd.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij stemt er bij dezen mee in dat een dergelijk juridisch geschil wordt voorgelegd aan het Internationale Centrum voor Beslechting van Investeringsgeschillen ter beslechting door conciliatie of arbitrage krachtens het Verdrag inzake de beslechting van geschillen met betrekking tot investeringen tussen Staten en onderdanen van andere Staten, dat op 18 maart 1965 te Washington (D.C.) werd opengesteld voor ondertekening. Een rechtspersoon die onderdaan is van de ene Verdragsluitende Partij en die, voordat een dergelijk geschil ontstaat, onder toezicht staat van onderdanen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt in overeenstemming met artikel 25, tweede lid, letter b, van het Verdrag voor de toepassing van het Verdrag behandeld als een onderdaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij.   
3.  Tenzij de partijen bij het geschil anders overeenkomen, neemt het scheidsgerecht waaraan een dergelijk juridisch geschil wordt voorgelegd, zijn beslissing overeenkomstig de wetten van de Verdragsluitende Partij – partij bij het geschil – (met inbegrip van de regels inzake wetsconflicten) en de toepasselijke regels van het internationale recht.   

### Artikel  10  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag zijn, vanaf de datum waarop dit in werking treedt, ook van toepassing op investeringen die voor die datum zijn gedaan.  

### Artikel  11  

Wat betreft het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden is dit Verdrag van toepassing op het deel van het Rijk in Europa, de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba, tenzij anders is bepaald in de in artikel 14, eerste lid, bedoelde mededeling.  

### Artikel  12  

Elk van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aan de andere Partij voorstellen overleg te plegen over een aangelegenheid betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag. De andere Partij neemt dit voorstel in welwillende overweging en biedt passende gelegenheid voor een dergelijk overleg.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  Enig geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitlegging of de toepassing van dit Verdrag dat niet binnen een redelijke termijn door middel van diplomatiek overleg kan worden beslecht, wordt, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, op verzoek van een van beide Partijen voorgelegd aan een uit drie leden samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Elke Partij benoemt een scheidsman en de twee aldus benoemde scheidslieden kiezen te zamen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan van een der Partijen is, tot hun voorzitter.   
2.  De scheidslieden worden benoemd binnen twee maanden en de voorzitter binnen drie maanden vanaf de datum waarop een der Partijen het verzoek tot arbitrage heeft ingediend.   
3.  Indien de noodzakelijke benoemingen niet zijn gedaan binnen de in het tweede lid van dit artikel genoemde termijn, kan elk der Partijen de president van het Internationale Gerechtshof verzoeken de noodzakelijke benoeming te verrichten. Indien de president van het Internationale Gerechtshof verhinderd is genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, wordt de vice-president verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten. Indien de vice-president verhinderd is de genoemde functie uit te oefenen, of onderdaan is van een van beide Partijen, wordt het lid van het Gerechtshof dat de hoogste anciënniteit heeft, beschikbaar is en geen onderdaan is van een der Partijen, verzocht de noodzakelijke benoemingen te verrichten.   
4.  Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak op basis van het internationale recht en alle verdragen die tussen de Partijen van kracht zijn (met inbegrip van dit Verdrag) en houdt waar nodig rekening met het desbetreffende nationale recht. Alvorens uitspraak te doen, kan het scheidsgerecht in elke stand van het geding een minnelijke schikking van het geschil aan de Partijen voorstellen. De voorgaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan de bevoegdheid van het scheidsgerecht tot een regeling van het geschil ex aequo et bono te besluiten, indien de Partijen dit overeenkomen.   
5.  Tenzij de Partijen anders beslissen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedureregels vast.   
6.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor de Partijen.   
7.  Indien enig juridisch geschil wordt voorgelegd ter beslechting door middel van conciliatie of arbitrage ingevolge artikel 9 van dit Verdrag, worden de arbitragebepalingen van dit artikel 13 niet betrokken bij dat geschil, behoudens in de gevallen waarin een uitspraak, beslissing of bereikte overeenstemming ingevolge conciliatie of arbitrage krachtens artikel 9 niet wordt nageleefd.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking op de eerste dag van de tweede maand die volgt op de datum waarop de Verdragsluitende Partijen elkaar schriftelijk ervan op de hoogte hebben gebracht dat aan hun grondwettelijk vereiste procedures is voldaan, en het blijft van kracht gedurende een tijdvak van vijftien jaar.   
2.  Tenzij ten minste zes maanden voor het verstrijken van de geldigheidsduur door een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen mededeling van beëindiging is gedaan, wordt dit Verdrag telkens stilzwijgend verlengd voor een tijdvak van tien jaar, waarbij elke Verdragsluitende Partij zich het recht voorbehoudt het Verdrag te beëindigen met inachtneming van een opzegtermijn van ten minste zes maanden voor het verstrijken van de lopende termijn van geldigheid.   
3.  Ten aanzien van investeringen die zijn gedaan voor de datum van beëindiging van dit Verdrag, blijven de voorgaande artikelen hiervan van kracht gedurende een tijdvak van vijftien jaar vanaf die datum.   
4.  Met inachtneming van de in de voorgaande leden van dit artikel genoemde termijnen van kennisgeving en geldigheid, is het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden gerechtigd de toepassing van dit Verdrag ten aanzien van enig deel van het Koninkrijk afzonderlijk te beëindigen.

Ten aanzien van de Republiek Zimbabwe wordt het volgende niet beschouwd als een „minder gunstige behandeling" zoals bedoeld in artikel 3: beperkingen betreffende de verwerving van land of andere onroerende eigendommen, behoudens land en onroerende eigendommen die in rechtstreeks verband staan met een investering.  

####Ad artikel 5 van het Verdrag

Ten aanzien van de Republiek Zimbabwe vindt de verplichting de vrije overmaking te waarborgen van de in artikel 5, letter g, bedoelde betalingen (de opbrengsten van verkoop of liquidatie van de investering) als volgt toepassing: 

a. in geval van investeringen gedaan op of na 1 mei 1993, kunnen genoemde betalingen volledig en vrijelijk worden overgemaakt;  

b. in geval van investeringen gedaan vóór 1 mei 1993, zijn deze betalingen onderworpen aan die voorwaarden voor overmaking (met name voorwaarden die betrekking hebben op het gedeelte van de betalingen dat mag worden overgemaakt) die met de onderdaan zijn overeengekomen en vastgelegd in de bewoordingen van de wetten van de Republiek Zimbabwe ten tijde van de toelating van de investering, mits aan de volgende voorwaarden wordt voldaan: 

i. bedoelde voorwaarden voor overmakingen mogen na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag niet zodanig worden gewijzigd dat de onderdaan hierdoor in een minder gunstige positie raakt; en  

ii. indien genoemde wetten inzake overmakingen ten tijde van de overmaking gunstiger zijn, mag de overmaking geschieden overeenkomstig deze gunstiger wetten; en  

iii. genoemde betalingen kunnen worden overgemaakt in termijnen over een tijdsbestek van maximaal 18 maanden, mits ten minste 50% van het totale bedrag ter overmaking gereed wordt gesteld ten tijde van het verzoek tot overmaking; 25% van het bedrag kan 9 maanden na dit verzoek worden overgemaakt en de resterende 25% van het bedrag kan 18 maanden na het bedoelde verzoek worden overgemaakt; en  

iv. een eventueel resterend saldo dat niet wordt overgemaakt, wordt, totdat het op de bovengenoemde wijze is overgemaakt, vastgehouden in Zimbabwe op een rekening luidend in de plaatselijke valuta tegen de lokaal geldende marktrente.
