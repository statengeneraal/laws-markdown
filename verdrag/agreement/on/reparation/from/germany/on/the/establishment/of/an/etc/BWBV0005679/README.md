### PART  I  

####German reparation.

### Article  1  

####Shares in reparation.

A.  German reparation (exclusive of the funds to be allocated under Article 8 of Part I of this Agreement), shall be divided into the following categories: 

*Category A*, which shall include all forms of German reparation except those included in Category B,  

*Category B*, which shall include industrial and other capital equipment removed from Germany, and merchant ships and inland water transport.     
B.  Each Signatory Government shall be entitled to the percentage share of the total value of Category A and the percentage share of the total value of Category B set out for that Government in the Table of Shares set forth below:  

| Country  | Category A  | Category B  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Albania  | 0.05  | 0.35  |
| United States of America  | 28.00  | 11.80  |
| Australia  | 0.70  | 0.95  |
| Belgium  | 2.70  | 4.50  |
| Canada  | 3.50  | 1.50  |
| Denmark  | 0.25  | 0.35  |
| Egypt  | 0.05  | 0.20  |
| France  | 16.00  | 22.80  |
| United Kingdom  | 28.00  | 27.80  |
| Greece  | 2.70  | 4.35  |
| India  | 2.00  | 2.90  |
| Luxembourg  | 0.15  | 0.40  |
| Norway  | 1.30  | 1.90  |

| Yugoslavia  | 6.60  | 9.60  |
| Total  | 100.00  | 100.00  |

<sup>1)</sup> The government of the Union of South Africa has undertaken to waive its claims to the extent necessary to reduce its percentage share of Category B to the figure of 0.1 per cent but is entitled, in disposing of German enemy assets within its jurisdiction, to charge the net value of such assets against its percentage share in Category A and a percentage share under Category B of 1.0 per cent.   
C.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph D below, each Signatory Government shall be entitled to receive its share of merchant ships determined in accordance with Article 5 of Part I of this Agreement, provided that its receipts of merchant ships, do not exceed in value its share in Category B as a whole. Subject to the provisions of paragraph D below, each Signatory Government shall also be entitled to its Category A percentage share in German assets in countries which remained neutral in the war against Germany. The distribution among the Signatory Governments of forms of German reparation other than merchant ships, inland water transport and German assets in countries which remained neutral in the war against Germany shall be guided by the principles set forth in Article 4 of Part I of this Agreement.   
D.  If a Signatory Government receives more than its percentage share of certains types of assets in either Category A or Category B, its receipts of other types of assets in that Category shall be reduced so as to ensure that it shall not receive more than its share in that Category as a whole.   
E.  No Signatory Government shall receive more than its percentage share of either Category A or Category B as a whole by surrendering any part of its percentage share of the other Category, except that with respect to German enemy assets within its own jurisdiction, any Signatory Government shall be permitted to charge any excess of such assets over its Category A percentage share of total German enemy assets within the jurisdiction of the Signatory Governments either to its receipts in Category A or to its receipts in Category B or in part to each Category.   
F.  The Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, to be estabished in accordance with Part II of this Agreement, shall charge the reparation account of each Signatory Government for the German assets within that Government's jurisdiction over a period of five years. The charges at the date of the entry into force of this Agreement shall be not less thans 20 per cent of the net value of such assets (as defined in Article 6 of Part I of this Agreement) as then estimated, at the beginning of the second year thereafter not less than 25 percent of the balance as then estimated, at the beginning of the third year not less than 33½ per cent of the balance as then estimated, at the beginning of the fourth year not less than 50 per cent of the balance as then estimated, at the beginning of the fifth year not less than 90 per cent of the balance as then estimated, and at the end of the fifth year the entire remainder of the total amount actually realized.   
G.  The following exceptions to paragraphs D and E above shall apply in the case of a Signatory Government whose share in Category B is less than its share in Category A: 

(i) Receipts of merchant ships by any such Government shall not reduce its percentage share in other types of assets in Category B, except to the extent that such receipts exceed the value obtained when that Government's Category A percentage is applied to the total value of merchant ships.  

(ii) Any excess of German assets within the jurisdiction of such Government over its Category A percentage share of the total of German assets within the Jurisdiction of Signatory Governments as a whole shall be charged first to the additional share in Category B to which that Government would be entitled if its share in Category B were determined by applying its Category A percentage to the forms of German reparation in Category B.     
H.  If any Signatory Government renounces its shares or part of its shares in German reparation as set out in the above Table of Shares, or if it withdraws from the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency at a time when all or part of its shares in German reparation remain unsatisfied, the shares or part thereof thus renounced or remaining shall be distributed rateably among the other Signatory Governments.   

### Article  2  

####Settlement of Claims against Germany.

A.  The Signatory Governments agree among themselves that their respective shares of reparation, as determined by the present Agreement, shall be regarded by each of them as covering all its claims and those of its nationals against the former German Government and its Agencies, of a governmental or private nature, arising out of the war (which are not otherwise provided for), including costs of German occupation, credits acquired during occupation on clearing accounts and claims against the Reichskreditkassen.   
B.  The provisions of paragraph A above are without prejudice to: 

(i) The determination at the proper time of the forms, duration or total amount of reparation to be made by Germany;  

(ii) The right which each Signatory Government may have with respect to the final settlement of German reparation, and  

(iii) Any political, territorial or other demands which any Signatory Government may put forward with respect to the peace settlement with Germany.     
C.  Notwithstanding anything in the provisions of paragraph A above, the present Agreement shall not be considered as affecting: 

(i) The obligation of the appropriate authorities in Germany to secure at a future date the discharge of claims against Germany and German nationals arising out of contracts and other obligations entered into, and rights acquired, before the existence of a state of war between Germany and the Signatory Government concerned or before the occupation of its territory by Germany, whichever was earlier;  

(i) The claims of Social Insurance Agencies of the Signatory Governments or the claims of their nationals against the Social Insurance Agencies of the former German Government; and  

(iii) Banknotes of the Reichsbank and the Rentenbank, it being understood that their realization shall not have the result of reducing improperly the amount of reparation and shall not be effected without the approval of the Control Council for Germany.     
D.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A of this Article, the Signatory Governments agree that, so far as they are concerned, the Czechoslovak Government will be entitled to draw upon the Giro Account of the National Bank of Czechoslovakia at the Reichsbank, should such action be decided upon by the Czechoslovak Government and approved by the Control Council for Germany, in connection with the movement from Czechoslovakia to Germany of former Czechoslovak nationals.   

### Article  3  

####Waiver of Claims Regarding Property Allocated as Reparation.

Each of the Signatory Governments agrees that it will not assert, initiate actions in international tribunals in respect of, or give diplomatic support to claims on behalf of itself or those persons entitled to its protection against any other Signatory Government or its nationals in respect of property received by that Government as reparation with the approval of the Control Council for Germany.  

### Article  4  

####General Principles for the Allocation of Industrial and other Capital Equipment.

A.  No Signatory Government shall request the allocation to it as reparation of any industrial or other capital equipment removed from Germany except for use in its own territory or for use by its own nationals outside its own territory.   
B.  In submitting requests to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency, the Signatory Governments should endeavour to submit comprehensive programs of requests for related groups of items, rather than requests for isolated items or small groups of items. It is recognized that the work of the Secretariat of the Agency will be more effective, the more comprehensive the programs which Signatory Governments submit to it.   
C.  In the allocation by the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency of items declared available for reparation (other than merchant ships, inland water transport and German assets in countries which remained neutral in the war against Germany), the following general principles shall serve as guides. 

(i) Any item or related group of items in which a claimant country has a substantial prewar financial interest shall be allocated to that country if it so desires. Where two or more claimants have such substantial interests in a particular item or group of items, the criteria stated below shall guide the allocation.  

(ii) If the allocation between competing claimants is not determined by paragraph (*i*), attention shall be given, among other relevant factors, to the following considerations: 

(a) The urgency of each claimant country's needs for the item or items to rehabilitate, reconstruct or restore to full activity the claimant country's economy;  

(b) The extent to which the item or items would replace property which was destroyed, damaged or looted in the war, or requires replacement because of excessive wear in war production, and which is important to the claimant country's economy;  

(c) The relation of the item or items to the general pattern of the claimant country's prewar economic life and to programs for its postwar economic adjustment or development;  

(d) The requirements of countries whose reparation shares are small but which are in need of certain specific items or categories of items.    

(iii) In making allocations a reasonable balance shall be maintained among the rates at which the reparation shares of the several claimant Governments are satisfied, subject to such temporary exceptions as are justified by the considerations under paragraph (*ii*) (*a*) above.     

### Article  5  

####General Principles for the Allocation of Merchant Ships and Inland Water Transport.

A.  

(i) German merchant ships available for distribution as reparation among the Signatory Governments shall be distributed among them in proportion to the respective over-all losses of merchant shipping, on a gross tonnage basis, of the Signatory Governments and their nationals through acts of war. It is recognized that transfers of merchant ships by the United Kingdom and United States Governments to other Governments are subject to such final approvals by the legislatures of the United Kingdom and United States of America as may be required.  

(ii) A special committee, composed of representatives of the Signatory Governments, shall be appointed by the Assembly of the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency to make recommendations concerning the determination of such losses and the allocation of German merchant ships available for distribution.  

(iii) The value of German merchant ships for reparation accounting purposes shall be the value determined by the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission in terms of 1938 prices in Germany plus 15 per cent, with an allowance for depreciation.     
B.  Recognizing that some countries have special need for inland water transport, the distribution of inland water transport shall be dealt with by a special committee appointed by the Assembly of the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency in the event that inland water transport becomes available at a future time as reparation for the Signatory Governments. The valuation of inland water transport will be made on the basis adopted for the valuation of merchant ships or on an equitable basis in relation to that adopted for merchant ships.   

### Article  6  

####German External Assets.

A.  Each Signatory Government shall, under such procedures as it may choose, hold or dispose of German enemy assets within its jurisdiction in manners designed to preclude their return to German ownership or control and shall charge against its reparation share such assets (net of accrued taxes, liens, expenses of administration, other *in rem* charges against specific items and legitimate contract claims against the German former owners of such assets).   
B.  The Signatory Governments shall give to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency all information for which it asks as to the value of such assets and the amounts realized from time to time by their liquidation.   
C.  German assets in those countries which remained neutral in the war against Germany shall be removed from German ownership or control and liquidated or disposed of in accordance with the authority of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, pursuant to arrangements to be negotiated with the neutrals by these countries. The net proceeds of liquidation or disposition shall be made available to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency for distribution on reparation account.   
D.  In applying the provisions of paragraph A above, assets which were the property of a country which is a member of the United Nations or its nationals who were not nationals of Germany at the time of the occupation or annexation of this country by Germany, or of its entry into war, shall not be charged to its reparation account. It is understood that this provision in no way prejudges any questions which may arise as regards assets which were not the property of a national of the country concerned at the time of the latter's occupation or annexation by Germany or of its entry into war.   
E.  The German enemy assets to be charged against reparation shares shall include assets which are in reality German enemy assets, despite the fact that the nominal owner of such assets is not a German enemy. Each Signatory Government shall enact legislation or take other appropriate steps, if it has not already done so, to render null and void all transfers made, after the occupation of its territory or its entry into war, for the fraudulent purpose of cloaking German enemy interests, and thus saving them harmless from the effect of control measures regarding German enemy interests.   
F.  The Assembly of the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency shall set up a Committee of Experts in matters of enemy property custodianship in order to overcome practical difficulties of law and interpretation which may arise. The Committee should in particular guard against schemes which might result in effecting fictitious or other transactions designed to favour enemy interests, or to reduce improperly the amount of assets which might be allocated to reparation.   

### Article  7  

####Captured supplies.

The value of supplies and other materials susceptible of civilian use captured from the German Armed Forces in areas outside Germany and delivered to Signatory Governments shall be charged against their reparation shares in so far as such supplies and materials have not been or are not, in the future either paid for or delivered under arrangements precluding any charge. It is recognised that transfers of such supplies and material by the United Kingdom and United States Governments to other Governments are agreed to be subject to such final approval by the legislature of the United Kingdom or the United States of America as may be required.  

### Article  8  

####Allocation of a Reparation Share to Non-repatriable Victims of German Action.

In recognition of the fact large numbers of persons have suffered heavily at the hands of the Nazis and now stand in dire need of aid to promote their rehabilitation but will be unable to claim the assistance of any Government receiving reparation from Germany, the Governments of the United States of America, France, the United Kingdom, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, in consultation with the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees, shall as soon as possible work out in common agreement a plan on the following general lines: 

A. A share of reparation consisting of all the non-monetary gold found by the Allied Armed Forces in Germany and in addition a sum not exceeding 25 million dollars shall be allocated for the rehabilitation and resettlement of non-repatriable victims of German action.  

B. The sum of 25 million dollars shall be met from a portion of the proceeds of German assets in neutral countries which are available for reparation.  

C. Governments of neutral countries shall be requested to make available for this purpose (in addition to the sum of 25 million dollars) assets in such countries of victims of Nazi action who have since died and left no heirs.  

D. The persons eligible for aid under the plan in question shall be restricted to true victims of Nazi persecution and to their immediate families and dependents, in the following classes: 

(i) Refugees from Nazi Germany or Austria who require aid and cannot be returned to their countries within a reasonable time because of prevailing conditions;  

(ii) German and Austrian nationals now resident in Germany or Austria in exceptional cases in which it is reasonable on grounds of humanity to assist such persons to emigrate and providing they emigrate to other countries within a reasonable period;  

(iii) Nationals of countries formerly occupied by the Germans who cannot be repatriated or are not in a position to be repatriated within a reasonable time. In order to concentrate aid on the most needy and deserving refugees and to exclude persons whose loyalty to the United Nations is or was doubtful, aid shall be restricted to nationals or former nationals of previously occupied countries who were victims of Nazi concentration camps or of concentration camps established by regimes under Nazi influence but not including persons who have been confined only in prisoners of war camps.    

E. The sums made available under paragraphs A and B above shall be administered by the inter-governmental Refugees or by a United Nations Agency to which appropriate functions of the Inter-Governmental Committee may in the future be transferred. The sums made available under paragraph C above shall be administered for the general purposes referred to in this article under a program of administration to be formulated by the five Governments named above.  

F. The non-monetary gold found in Germany shall be placed at the disposal of the inter-governmental Committee on Refugees as soon as a plan has been worked out as provided above.  

G. The inter-governmental Committee on Refugees shall have power to carry out the purposes of the fund through appropriate public and private field organisations.  

H. The fund shall be used, not for the compensation of individual victims, but to further the rehabilitation or resettlement of persons in the eligible classes.  

I. Nothing in this article shall be considered to prejudice the claims which individual refugees may have against a future German Government, except to the amount of the benefits that such refugees may have received from the sources referred to in paragraphs A and C above.    

### PART  II  

####Inter-AIlied Reparation Agency.

### Article  1

B.  Without prejudice to claims by way of reparation for unrestored gold, the portion of monetary gold thus accruing to each country participating in the pool shall be accepted by that country in full satisfaction of all claims against Germany for restitution of monetary gold.   
C.  A proportional share of the gold shall be allocated to each country concerned which adheres to this arrangement for the restitution of monetary gold and which can establish that a definite amount of monetary gold belonging to it was looted by Germany or, at any time after March 12th, 1938, was wrongfully removed into German territory.

<sup>1)</sup> De Regering der Zuid-Afrikaanse Unie heeft zich verbonden af te zien van haar rechten, voor zover nodig is om haar aandeel in categorie B op 0,1 % te brengen, maar deze Regering zal het recht hebben, als zij zal beschikken over vijandelijk Duitse bezittingen, welke zich bevinden op aan haar jurisdictie onderworpen grondgebied, het bedrag der netto waarde van die bezittingen te verrekenen met haar aandeel in de categorie A en met een aandeel van 1 % in categorie B.   
C.  Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in paragraaf D, hieronder vermeld, heeft iedere ondertekenende Regering het recht, van de koopvaardijschepen een deel, vastgesteld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 5 van deel I van deze overeenkomst, te ontvangen, op voorwaarde, dat de waarde van de koopvaardijschepen, die aan haar worden toegewezen, niet de waarde overtreft van het aandeel, waarop zij recht heeft in het totaal der goederen van categorie B. Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in paragraaf D, hieronder vermeld, heeft iedere ondertekenende Regering insgelijks het recht een met haar rechten op het totaal der goederen van categorie A overeenkomend aandeel te ontvangen van de Duitse bezittingen, welke zich bevinden in de landen die in de oorlog tegen Duitsland neutraal zijn gebleven. De verdeling onder de ondertekenende Regeringen van de goederen die beschikbaar zijn voor Duitse herstelbetalingen, andere dan koopvaardijschepen, binnenschepen en Duitse bezittingen in de landen, die in de oorlog tegen Duitsland neutraal zijn gebleven, zal geschieden overeenkomstig de beginselen, vermeld in artikel 4 van deel I van deze overeenkomst.   
D.  Indien een ondertekenende Regering van bepaalde soorten goederen, hetzij van categorie A, hetzij van categorie B, meer ontvangt dan haar percentage, zullen haar rechten op andere soorten goederen van dezelfde categorie zodanig worden verminderd, dat deze Regering in totaal niet meer ontvangt dan haar aandeel in de betrokken categorie in haar geheel.   
E.  Geen ondertekenende Regering kan meer ontvangen dan haar percentage, hetzij van categorie A, hetzij van categorie B in haar geheel, door afstand te doen van een gedeelte van haar percentage van de andere categorie; evenwel, wat de vijandelijke Duitse bezittingen betreft, die zijn onderworpen aan de jurisdictie van een ondertekenende Regering, zal deze Regering het recht hebben, het meerdere van zodanige bezittingen boven haar aandeel in het totaal der vijandelijke Duitse bezittingen, die onderworpen zijn aan de jurisdictie der ondertekenende Regeringen, zoals dit is vastgesteld voor het totaal der goederen van categorie A, te verrekenen, hetzij met de te ontvangen goederen van categorie A, hetzij met de te ontvangen goederen van categorie B, hetzij gedeeltelijk met de goederen der beide categorieën.   
F.  De Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen, die moet worden ingesteld overeenkomstig deel II van deze overeenkomst, zal de rekening der herstelbetalingen van elk der ondertekenende Regeringen debiteren voor de aan zijn jurisdictie onderworpen Duitse bezittingen door deze debetbedragen over een periode van 5 jaar te verdelen. De debetbedragen, in rekening gebracht op de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze overeenkomst, mogen niet lager zijn dan 20% van de netto-waarde van die bezittingen (bepaald bij artikel 6 van deel I van deze overeenkomst) volgens de taxatie, die er op die datum van zal zijn gedaan; aan het begin van het tweede jaar zullen ze niet lager zijn dan 25% van het saldo volgens de schatting op die datum; aan het begin van het derde jaar zullen zij niet minder mogen zijn dan 33 1/3% van het saldo volgens de schatting op die datum; aan het begin van het vierde jaar zullen ze niet lager mogen zijn dan 50% van het saldo volgens de schatting op die datum; aan het begin van het vijfde jaar zullen ze niet lager mogen zijn dan 90% van het saldo volgens schatting op die datum en aan het einde van het vijfde jaar zullen ze gelijk zijn aan het saldo van het totale bedrag, dat inderdaad is gerealiseerd.   
G.  De volgende afwijkingen van de bepalingen van bovenstaande paragrafen D en E zijn toepasselijk ten aanzien van een ondertekenende Regering, wier aandeel van categorie B lager is, dan haar aandeel van categorie A. 

I. De toewijzing van koopvaardijschepen aan een zodanige Regering zal haar rechten op andere soorten goederen van categorie B niet verminderen, dan voor zover deze toewijzingen te boven gaan de waarde die verkregen wordt wanneer het aan die Regering toegekende percentage van categorie A wordt toegepast op de totale waarde van de koopvaardijschepen.  

II. Indien de waarde der Duitse bezittingen, die onderworpen zijn aan de jurisdictie van een zodanige Regering, haar aandeel in het totaal der Duitse bezittingen, die aan de jurisdictie der ondertekenende Regeringen zijn onderworpen, overschrijdt, blijkens het haar toegewezen percentage van categorie A, zal het verschil in de eerste plaats ten laste worden gebracht van het aanvullende gedeelte van het percentage, waarop deze Regering recht zou hebben in categorie B, indien men het percentage, waarop zij recht heeft in categorie A zou toepassen op de vormen van herstelbetalingen van categorie B.     
H.  Indien een ondertekenende Regering geheel of gedeeltelijk afziet van haar aandeel in de Duitse herstelbetalingen, zoals vermeld in bovenstaande „Tabel van Percentages”, of zich uit de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen terugtrekt op een tijdstip, waarop aan het geheel of een gedeelte van haar rechten op de Duitse herstelbetalingen nog niet is voldaan, zal het aandeel of gedeeltelijk aandeel waarvan zij afziet, of dat haar nog verschuldigd is op het ogenblik waarop zij zich terugtrekt, onder de andere ondertekenende Regeringen worden verdeeld naar rato van derzelver percentages.   

### Artikel  2  

####Regeling der schuldvorderingen op Duitsland

A.  De ondertekenende Regeringen komen onderling overeen, dat haar onderscheidene aandelen in de herstelbetalingen, zoals die door deze overeenkomst zijn vastgesteld, door ieder van haar beschouwd moeten worden als dekkende alle vorderingen van publiek en privaat karakter van haar en haar onderdanen op de Duitsche Regering en de Duitse Regeringsinstanties, voortgesproten uit de oorlog, voor zover niet uitdrukkelijk anders geregeld, met inbegrip van de kosten der Duitse bezetting, de tijdens de bezetting verkregen bedragen op rekening van de clearing en de schuldvorderingen op de Reichskreditkassen.   
B.  De bepalingen van bovenstaande paragraaf A prejudiciëren niet ten aanzien van: 

I. Het te zijner tijd bepalen van de vormen, de tijdsduur of het totale bedrag der herstelbetalingen, die Duitsland zal hebben te verrichten;  

II. Het recht, dat ieder der ondertekenende Regeringen zal kunnen hebben, inzake de definitieve regeling der Duitse herstelbetalingen:  

III. Iedere politieke, territoriale of andere eis, die een ondertekenende Regering zal kunnen stellen met betrekking tot de regeling van de vrede met Duitsland.     
C.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van bovenstaande paragraaf A, moet deze overeenkomst beschouwd worden geen betrekking te hebben op: 

I. De verplichting, die op de bevoegde autoriteiten in Duitsland rust om in de toekomst de betaling te verzekeren der schulden van Duitsland en zijn onderdanen, welke voortvloeien uit overeenkomsten en andere verplichtingen, die van kracht waren, evenals uit rechten, die reeds verkregen waren, voordat de staat van oorlog tussen Duitsland en de betrokken ondertekenende Regering bestond of vóór de bezetting van het betrokken land door Duitsland, naar gelang de eerste of de laatste gebeurtenis vroeger heeft plaatsgegrepen;  

II. De schuldvorderingen van instellingen voor sociale verzekering van de ondertekenende Regeringen of die van haar onderdanen op de instellingen voor sociale verzekering van de vroegere Duitse Regering;  

III. De bankbiljetten van Reichsbank en Rentenbank, met dien verstande, dat de besteding daarvan niet tot gevolg mag hebben, dat het bedrag der herstelbetalingen op ontoelaatbare wijze wordt verminderd, terwijl deze slechts mag plaats vinden met goedkeuring van de Bestuursraad in Duitsland.     
D.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van paragraaf A van dit artikel, komen de ondertekenende Regeringen overeen, voor zoveel haar aangaat, dat de Tsjecho-Slowaakse Regering bevoegd zal zijn om te trekken op de Girorekening van de Nationale Bank van Tsjecho-Slowakije bij de Reichsbank, voor het geval tot een zodanige maatregel zou worden besloten door de Tsjecho-Slowaakse Regering en deze wordt goedgekeurd door de Bestuursraad in Duitsland in verband met de wegvoering uit Tsjecho-Slowakije naar Duitsland van vroegere Tsjecho-Slowaakse onderdanen.   

### Artikel  3  

####Afstand van vorderingen inzake goederen, toegewezen bij wijze van herstelbetaling

Ieder der ondertekenende Regeringen verbindt zich niet op te komen voor, noch voor internationale rechtbanken te brengen, noch door diplomatieke actie te ondersteunen, vorderingen, die in haar naam of uit naam van personen, die recht hebben op haar bescherming, worden ingediend tegen enige andere ondertekenende Regering of tegen haar onderdanen, met betrekking tot goederen door die Regering ontvangen als herstelbetaling, onder goedkeuring van de Bestuursraad in Duitsland.  

### Artikel  4  

####Algemene beginselen voor de verdeling van industriële outillage en van andere kapitaalgoederen

A.  Geen ondertekenende Regering mag toewijzing vragen, bij wijze van herstelbetaling, van industriële outillage of andere kapitaalgoederen, die uit Duitsland zijn weggevoerd, tenzij voor gebruik op eigen grondgebied of door eigen onderdanen buiten haar grondgebied.   
B.  Bij het voorleggen van haar aanvragen aan de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen zullen de ondertekenende Regeringen er naar streven verzamelopgaven in te dienen, die samenhangende groepen van goederen omvatten, liever dan aanvragen te doen voor afzonderlijke goederen of voor kleine groepen goederen. Erkend wordt, dat de werkzaamheid van het secretariaat van de Organisatie doeltreffender zijn naarmate de door de bedoelde Regeringen aangeboden aanvragen meer omvattend zijn.   
C.  Voor toewijzing van voor herstelbetaling beschikbaar verklaarde goederen, andere dan koopvaardijschepen, binnenschepen en Duitse bezittingen in landen die tijdens de oorlog tegen Duitsland neutraal zijn gebleven, zal de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen uitgaan van de volgende algemene beginselen: 

I. Ieder goed of iedere groep van met elkaar verband staande goederen, waarin een vragend land aanzienlijke financiële belangen heeft, daterend van vóór de oorlog, moet desverlangd aan dat land worden toegewezen. Voor het geval twee of meer vragende landen aanzienlijke belangen van dien aard hebben in een bepaald goed of een bepaalde groep van goederen, zal bij de toewijzing rekening worden gehouden met de hieronder vermelde creteria;  

II. Indien de toewijzing tussen mededingende aanvragers niet geregeld is door paragraaf I, zal, behalve aan andere ter zake dienende factoren, aandacht moeten worden geschonken aan de volgende overwegingen: 

(a) De mate, waarin ieder vragend land behoefte heeft, om te beschikken over het goed of over de goederen om zijn economie te herstellen, weder op te bouwen, of weer op gang te brengen;  

(b) De mate, waarin het goed of de goederen in de plaats zouden treden van goederen, welke tijdens de oorlog zijn verwoest, beschadigd of geroofd, of van goederen, die moeten worden vervangen ten gevolge van abnormale slijtage, veroorzaakt door de productie tijdens de oorlog, en welke van belang zijn voor de economie van het vragende land;  

(c) De functies van het betreffende goed of de betreffende goederen in het algemene kader der voor-oorlogse economie van het vragende land en in de plannen, opgesteld met het doel zijn naoorlogse economie aan te passen en te ontwikkelen;  

(d) De aanvragen van landen, wier aandeel in de herstelbetalingen klein is, maar die behoefte hebben aan zekere duidelijk omschreven goederen of groepen van goederen.    

III. Bij de toewijzigingen zal een redelijk evenwicht moeten worden bewaard tussen de verschillende rechthebbenden wat betreft het reeds voldane gedeelte van hun onderscheidene aandelen, onder voorbehoud van die tijdelijke uitzonderingen, die kunnen worden gerechtvaardigd door de overwegingen van bovenstaande paragraaf II (a).     

### Artikel  5  

####Algemene beginselen voor de toewijzing van koopvaardijschepen en binnenschepen

A.  

I. De Duitse koopvaardijschepen, die beschikbaar zijn voor verdeling bij wijze van herstelbetaling onder de ondertekenende Regeringen, zullen tussen deze worden verdeeld in verhouding tot de globale verliezen aan koopvaardijschepen, die de ondertekenende Regeringen en haar onderdanen door oorlogshandelingen hebben geleden, berekend op basis van de bruto tonnenmaat. Erkend wordt, dat de overdracht van koopvaardijschepen door de Regeringen der Verenigde Staten van Amerika en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk aan andere Regeringen plaats heeft, onder voorbehoud van een definitieve goedkeuring door de wetgevende organen dezer beide landen, indien een zodanige goedkeuring vereist mocht zijn.  

II. Een speciale commissie, samengesteld uit vertegenwoordigers van de ondertekenende Regeringen, zal worden ingesteld door de Assemblée van de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen teneinde aanbevelingen te doen inzake het bepalen van die verliezen en de toewijzing der voor de verdeling beschikbare Duitse koopvaardijschepen.  

III. De waarde der Duitse koopvaardijschepen, die op de rekeningen der herstelbetalingen zal worden geboekt, zal worden vastgesteld door de uit drie leden bestaande Commissie van de Handelsvloot, op basis der prijzen in Duitsland van 1938, verhoogd met 15 % en met toepassing van een afschrijvingscoëfficiënt.     
B.  Erkennende, dat sommige landen in het bijzonder behoefte hebben aan binnenschepen, zal de verdeling van deze schepen worden toevertrouwd aan een speciale commissie, ingesteld door de Assemblée van de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen, voor het geval binnenschepen in de toekomst als herstelbetaling voor de ondertekenende Regeringen beschikbaar mochten komen. De binnenschepen zullen worden getaxeerd op de basis, aangenomen voor de koopvaardijvloot of op een daarmee overeenkomende billijke basis.   

### Artikel  6  

####Buiten Duitsland gelegen Duitse bezittingen

A.  Iedere ondertekenende Regering zal, volgens zelf te bepalen methode, de vijandelijke Duitse bezittingen, die zich op het onder haar jurisdictie staand grondgebied bevinden, onder zich houden, of er over beschikken op een zodanige wijze, dat zij niet opnieuw Duits eigendom kunnen worden of weer onder Duitse zeggenschap kunnen komen, en zal deze bezittingen met haar aandeel in de herstelbetalingen verrekenen (na aftrek van achterstallige belastingen, bevoorrechte schulden en kosten van beheer en vrij van alle andere zakelijke lasten, die op bepaalde goederen drukken, en vrij van alle wettelijke contractuele vorderingen op vroegere Duitse eigenaars dier bezittingen).   
B.  De ondertekenende Regeringen zullen aan de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen alle inlichtingen verschaffen, welke deze zal vragen omtrent de waarde van die bezittingen en omtrent de opbrengsten, welke periodiek worden verkregen door de liquidatie van deze bezittingen.   
C.  De eigendom van of de zeggenschap over Duitse bezittingen, welke zich bevinden in landen, die tijdens de oorlog tegen Duitsland neutraal zijn gebleven, zal aan Duitsland worden ontnomen. Deze bezittingen zullen worden geliquideerd of er zal over worden beschikt overeenkomstig de beschikkingen, die de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, Frankrijk en het Verenigd Koninkrijk kunnen treffen, ter uitvoering van regelingen, waaromtrent deze mogendheden zullen onderhandelen met de neutrale landen; de netto opbrengst, voortvloeiende uit de liquidatie van of de beschikking over deze bezittingen, zal ter beschikking worden gesteld van de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen, om als herstelbetaling te worden verdeeld.   
D.  Bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van bovenstaande paragraaf A zullen de bezittingen, die het eigendom waren van een land, dat lid is der Verenigde Naties, of van een onderdaan van dat land en niet van Duitsland, op het ogenblik der annexatie of der bezetting van dat land door Duitsland of der deelname van dat land aan de oorlog, niet worden verrekend met zijn rekening der herstelbetalingen, met dien verstande, dat deze bepaling niet prejudiciëert ten aanzien van eventuele problemen met betrekking tot bezittingen, die niet het eigendom waren van een onderdaan van het bedoelde land op het ogenblik van de annexatie of bezetting van dat land door Duitsland of van zijn deelname aan de oorlog.   
E.  De vijandelijke Duitse bezittingen, die moeten worden verrekend met de aandelen in de herstelbetalingen, zullen alle bezittingen moeten omvatten, die in wezen vijandelijke Duitse bezittingen zijn, zelfs indien de schijnbare eigenaar van die goederen geen vijandelijke Duitser is. Elke ondertekenende Regering moet, indien zij daartoe niet reeds is overgegaan, alle wettelijke en andere maatregelen nemen, welke nodig zijn om alle leveringen ongedaan te maken, die plaats vonden na de bezetting van haar grondgebied of haar deelname aan de oorlog, met de bedoeling om de vijandelijke Duitse belangen op bedriegelijke wijze te camoufleren en deze te onttrekken aan de controlemaatregelen ten aanzien van de vijandelijke Duitse belangen.   
F.  De Assemblée van de Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen zal een commissie van deskundigen op het gebied van beheer van vijandelijk vermogen benoemen, teneinde de practische moeilijkheden op te lossen, die zich kunnen voordoen met betrekking tot het recht en de interpretatie daarvan. De commissie zal er met name op moeten toezien, dat alles vermeden wordt wat tot resultaat kan hebben het voortduren van fictieve of andere transacties, bestemd hetzij om vijandelijke belangen te bevoordelen, hetzij om onrechtmatig de hoeveelheid der bezittingen te verkleinen, die onder de herstelbetalingen zouden kunnen vallen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Buitgemaakte voorraden

De waarde der voorraden en ander voor civiel gebruik geschikte materialen, welke buiten Duitsland op de Duitse Weermacht zijn buitgemaakt en ter beschikking zijn gesteld van de ondertekenende Regeringen, zal worden verrekend met haar aandelen in de herstelbetalingen, voor zover deze voorraden en materialen niet zijn of zullen worden hetzij betaald, hetzij geleverd krachtens regelingen, welke enige verrekening uitsluiten. Erkend wordt, dat terbeschikkingstelling van zodanige voorraden en materialen door de Regeringen der Verenigde Staten van Amerika en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk aan andere Regeringen onderworpen is aan de definitieve goedkeuring door de wetgevende organen dier beide landen, als deze vereist is.  

### Artikel  8  

####Toekenning van een deel der herstelbetalingen aan slachtoffers der Duitse actie, die niet naar hun vaderland kunnen terugkeren

Aangezien een groot aantal personen zwaar door de gedragingen van de Nazi's heeft geleden, en thans dringend behoefte heeft aan hulp bij hun herstel en geen hulp kan vragen aan enige Regering, die herstelbetalingen ontvangt van Duitsland, zullen de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Tsjecho-Slowakije en Joego-Slavië, na raadpleging van de Intergouvernementale Vluchtelingen Commissie, zo spoedig mogelijk in onderling overleg een plan opmaken op grond van de volgende algemene beginselen: 

A. Een deel der herstelbetalingen, bestaande uit al het door de geallieerde troepen in Duitsland gevonden niet-monetaire goud en uit een aanvullend bedrag, dat 25 millioen dollars niet zal te boven gaan, zal toegekend worden voor het herstel en de nieuwe vestiging van de slachtoffers der Duitse actie, die niet naar hun vaderland kunnen terugkeren.  

B. Deze som van 25 millioen dollars zal worden verkregen uit een deel van de opbrengst der liquidatie van de Duitse bezittingen in neutrale landen, welke beschikbaar is voor herstelbetalingen.  

C. Aan de Regeringen der neutrale landen zal worden verzocht voor dat doel (boven de som van 25 millioen dollars) de zich in genoemde lande bevindene bezittingen beschikbaar te stellen, welke toebehoren aan slachtoffers van de actie der Nazi's, die sindsdien zijn gestorven zonder erfgenomen achter te laten.  

D. Slechts de volgende categorieën van personen, die werkelijke slachtoffers zijn der Nazi-vervolging, benevens hun naaste familie en personen te hunnen laste, komen in aanmerking voor hulp ingevolge het onderhavige plan: 

I. Vluchtelingen uit Nazi Duitsland of Oostenrijk, die hulp behoeven en die ten gevolge van de bestaande omstandigheden niet binnen een redelijke tijd naar hun land kunnen worden teruggezonden.  

II. Duitse en Oostenrijkse onderdanen, die thans in Duitsland of Oostenrijk wonen, in de uitzonderlijke gevallen, dat het uit humanitaire overwegingen redelijk is hen te helpen emigreren, mits zij binnen een redelijke termijn daadwerkelijk emigreren.  

III. Onderdanen van voormalig door de Duitsers bezette landen, die niet gerepatrieerd kunnen worden of voor wie zulks binnen redelijke tijd onmogelijk is. Ten einde alle hulp te reserveren voor de meest behoeftige en verdienstelijke vluchtelingen en personen, wier trouw aan de zaak der Verenigde Naties twijfelachtig is of was, uit te sluiten, zal de hulp slechts worden verleend aan onderdanen of voormalige onderdanen van voorheen bezette landen, die slachtoffers waren van Nazi-concentratiekampen of van concentratiekampen, opgericht door een onder Nazi-invloed staand régime, hieronder niet begrepen de personen, die uitsluitend in krijgsgevangenenkampen zijn geïnterneerd geweest.    

E. De middelen, beschikbaar gesteld overeenkomstig de bovenstaande paragrafen A en B, zullen worden beheerd door de Intergouvernementale Vluchtelingen Commissie of door een organisatie van de Verenigde Naties, waaraan in de toekomst de functies, die de Intergouvernementale Commissie op dat gebied uitoefent, mochten worden overgedragen. De overeenkomstig de bepalingen van bovenstaande paragraaf C beschikbaar komende middelen zullen worden beheerd voor de in dit artikel aangegeven algemene doeleinden, overeenkomstig een plan van beheer, op te maken door de vijf bovengenoemde Regeringen.  

F. Het in Duitsland gevonden niet-monetaire goud zal ter beschikking worden gesteld van de Intergouvernementale Vluchtelingen Commissie, zodra het plan zal zijn uitgewerkt.  

G. De Intergouvernementale Vluchtelingen Commissie zal de bevoegdheid hebben de verwezenlijking der doeleinden, waarvoor het fonds is ingesteld, te verzekeren met behulp van deskundige openbare of particuliere organisaties.  

H. De middelen zullen worden gebruikt, niet om individuele slachtoffers schadeloos te stellen, maar om het herstel en de nieuwe vestiging te bevorderen van personen, die behoren tot de voor hulp in aanmerking komende categorieën.  

I. Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel zal geacht worden te prejudiciëren ten aanzien van de vorderingen, welke de vluchtelingen individueel kunnen hebben op een toekomstige Duitse Regering, behoudens voor de bedragen, welke deze vluchtelingen hebben ontvangen uit de in bovenstaande paragrafen A en C vermelde bronnen.    

### DEEL  II  

####Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen

### Artikel  1  

####Instelling van de Organisatie

De Regeringen, welke de onderhavige overeenkomst hebben getekend, stellen een Intergeallieerde Organisatie voor Herstelbetalingen in (hierna genoemd „Organisatie”). Ieder van hen benoemt een gedelegeerde bij de Organisatie, en kan insgelijks een plaatsvervangend gedelegeerde benoemen, die, bij afwezigheid van de gedelegeerde, diens functies en diens bevoegdheden uitoefent.  

### Artikel  2  

####Taak van de Organisatie

A.  De Organisatie verdeelt de Duitse herstelbetalingen onder de ondertekenende Regeringen, volgens de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst en van alle andere overeenkomsten, die van kracht zijn of zullen zijn tussen de ondertekenende Regeringen. Te dien einde is de Organisatie het orgaan, door welks tussenkomst de ondertekenende Regeringen inlichtingen ontvangen over de goederen, die voor herstelbetaling beschikbaar zijn en hieromtrent hun wensen kenbaar maken.   
B.  De Organisatie behandelt alle kwesties met betrekking tot de restitutie aan een ondertekenende Regering van eigendommen, welke welke zich bevinden in een der Westelijke zones van Duitsland, haar toegewezen door de Opperbevelhebber van die zône (handelend namens zijn Regering), in overeenstemming met de vragende Regering(en), zonder evenwel te prejudiciëren ten aanzien van de regering van zodanige kwesties tussen de betrokken ondertekenende Regeringen, hetzij door overeenkomst, hetzij door arbitrage.   

### Artikel  3  

####Organen van de Organisatie

A.  De organen van de Organisatie zijn de Assemblée en het Secretariaat.   
B.  De Assemblée is samengesteld uit de gedelegeerden en wordt voorgezeten door de President van de Organisatie. De President van de Organisatie is de gedelegeerde van de Franse Regering.   
C.  Het Secretariaat staat onder leiding van een Secretaris-Generaal, bijgestaan door twee Adjunct-Secretarissen-Generaal. De Secretaris-Generaal en de beide Adjunct-Secretarissen-Generaal worden benoemd door de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, van Frankrijk en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Het Secretariaat heeft een internationaal karakter. Het handelt namens de Organisatie en niet namens de afzonderlijke ondertekenende Regeringen.   

### Artikel  4  

####Taak van het Secretariaat.

Het Secretariaat beeft tot taak: 

A. Het voorbereiden van plannen voor de verdeling der Duitse herstelbetalingen en het voorleggen daarvan aan de Assemblée;  

B. Het bijhouden van een gedetailleerde boekhouding van de goederen, welke als Duitse herstelbetalingen beschikbaar zijn en van goederen, die uit dien hoofde zijn verdeeld;  

C. Het voorbereiden van de begroting van de Organisatie en het voorleggen daarvan aan de Assemblée;  

D. Het vervullen van andere noodzakelijke administratieve werkzaamheden.    

### Artikel  5  

####Taak van de Assemblée

Onder voorbehoud der bepalingen van artikel 4 en 7 van Deel II van deze overeenkomst wijst de Assemblée de Duitse herstelbetalingen aan de ondertekenende Regeringen toe, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst en van alle andere overeenkomsten, die tussen bedoelde ondertekenende Regeringen van kracht zijn of zullen zijn. Zij keurt insgelijks de begroting van de Organisatie goed en vervult alle andere functies, die verenigbaar zijn met de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  6  

####Beroep tegen besluiten der Assemblée

Tenzij anders bepaald bij deze overeenkomst, beschikt iedere gedelegeerde over één stem. De besluiten van de Assemblée worden genomen bij meerderheid der uitgebrachte stemmen.  

### Artikel  7  

####Beroep tegen de besluiten der Assemblée

A.  Als de Assemblée niet voldaan heeft aan het verzoek van een gedelegeerde, om een goed aan zijn Regering toe te wijzen, onderwerpt de Assemblée de kwestie aan arbitrage, indien de gedelegeerde, binnen de door de Assemblée vastgestelde termijn, hierom verzoekt. Hangende arbitrage wordt het betrokken besluit van de Assemblée geschorst.   
B.  De gedelegeerden der Regeringen, die een goed vragen, waarvan de toewijzing krachtens de bovengenoemde paragraaf A aan arbitrage is onderworpen, wijzen een scheidsman aan, gekozen uit de andere gedelegeerden. Indien geen overeenstemming kan worden bereikt over de keuze van een scheidsman, neemt de gedelegeerde van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika de functie van scheidsman waar, of benoemt hij een scheidsman uit de gedelegeerden, wier Regeringen het bedoelde goed niet vragen. Indien de Regering der Verenigde Staten van Amerika een der Regeringen is, die het bedoelde goed vragen, wijst de President van de Organisatie als scheidsman een gedelegeerde aan, wiens Regering het goed niet vraagt.   

### Artikel  8  

####Bevoegdheden van de scheidsman

Als de kwestie van de toewijzing van een goed arbitrage wordt onderworpen overeenkomstig artikel 7 van Deel II van deze overeenkomst, heeft de scheidsman in laatste instantie de bevoegdheid het bedoelde goed aan een der vragende Regeringen toe te wijzen. De scheidsman kan, te zijner beslissing, de toewijzing van het bedoelde goed weer naar het Secretariaat terugwijzen voor een aanvullend onderzoek. Hij kan ook, te zijner beslissing, het Secretariaat verzoeken de toewijzing van het goed in kwestie opnieuw aan de Assemblée voor te leggen.  

### Artikel  9  

####Uitgaven

A.  De salarissen en de kosten van de gedelegeerden en hun personeel worden door hun Regeringen betaald.   
B.  De gewone uitgaven van de Organisatie worden betaald uit de geldmiddelen van de Organisatie. Deze geldmiddelen worden verschaft door iedere ondertekenende Regering, voor de eerste twee jaren vanaf de instelling van de Assemblée, in verhouding tot haar aandeel in categorie B en vervolgens in verhouding tot haar aandeel in categorie A.   
C.  Iedere ondertekenende Regering betaalt haar aandeel in de begroting der Organisatie voor iedere begrotingsperiode (zoals die door de Assemblée is vastgesteld) bij het begin van deze periode, met dien verstande, dat bij het tekenen van deze overeenkomst iedere Regering, op een totaal van 50 000 pond sterling, ten minste een bijdrage verleent in verhouding tot haar aandeel in categorie B en dat zij binnen de drie volgende maanden de rest van haar aandeel in de begroting der Organisatie betaalt voor de begrotingsperiode, in de loop waarvan zij deze overeenkomst tekent.   
D.  Alle bedragen, welke door de ondertekenende Regeringen zijn verschuldigd, worden betaald in Belgische francs of in een of meerdere andere valuta's, welke de Organisatie mocht bepalen.   

### Artikel  10  

####Stemming over de begroting

Bij het onderzoek van de begroting van de Organisatie voor iedere begrotingsperiode, heeft iedere gedelegeerde in de Assemblée een aantal stemmen, dat evenredig is met het aandeel, dat door zijn Regering is verschuldigd voor de betreffende begrotingsperiode.  

### Artikel  11  

####Officiële talen

De officiële talen van de Organisatie zijn Engels en Frans.  

### Artikel  12

Iedere ondertekenende Regering, met uitzondering van de Regelingen, welke verantwoordelijk zijn voor het bestuur over een gedeelte van het Duitse grondgebied, kan zich uit de Organisatie terugtrekken na schriftelijke kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat.  

### Artikel  14  

####Wijzigingen en ontbinding

Deel II van deze overeenkomst kan worden gewijzigd, of de Organisatie worden ontbonden, door een besluit van de Assemblée, genomen met meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen, mits de gedelegeerden, die deze meerderheid vormen, Regeringen vertegenwoordigen, waarvan het gezamenlijke percentage in categorie A minstens 80 bedraagt.  

### Artikel  15

####Restitutie van monetair goud

### Enig  Artikel  

A.  Al het monetaire goud, dat in Duitsland door de geallieerde strijdkrachten wordt gevonden en het goud bedoeld in onderstaande paragraaf G (met inbegrip van gouden munten, voorzover die geen numismatische of historische waarde hebben, welke laatste onmiddellijk zullen worden teruggegeven, als ze kunnen worden geïdentificeerd), zal worden samengebracht ter verdeling, bij wijze van restitutie, onder de hierbij toegelaten landen, in verhouding tot het verlies aan goud, door elk hunner geleden ten gevolge van roof door of onrechtmatig wegvoeren naar Duitsland.   
B.  Zonder te prejudiciëren ten aanzien van aanspraken op herstelbetaling ter vergoeding van niet-gerestitueerd goud, zal de hoeveelheid monetair goud, die aldus toekomt aan ieder der tot de verdeling toegelaten landen, door dit land worden aanvaard als volledige voldoening van alle vorderingen op Duitsland, met betrekking tot restitutie van monetair goud.   
C.  Een evenredig deel van het goud zal worden toegewezen aan ieder betrokken land, dat deze regeling voor de restitutie van monetair goud aanneemt en dat kan aantonen, dat een bepaalde, hem toebehorende, hoeveelheid monetair goud door Duitsland is geroofd of op een datum na 12 Maart 1938 onrechtmatig is overgebracht naar Duits grondgebied.   
D.  De kwestie van eventuele deelname van niet op de Conferentie vertegenwoordigde landen (met uitzondering van Duitsland, maar met inbegrip van Oostenrijk en Italië) aan bovenvermelde verdeling blijft voorbehouden; het equivalent van wat het totaal zou vormen van de aandelen dier landen, indien ze werden toegelaten tot deze verdeling, zal gereserveerd blijven, opdat er nader over worde beschikt, volgens de beslissing van de betrokken geallieerde Regeringen.   
E.  De onderscheidene tot de verdeling toegelaten landen zullen aan de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, van Frankrijk en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, in haar hoedanigheid van bezettende Mogendheden, nauwkeurige en te verifiëren inlichtingen verschaffen nopens het goudverlies, dat zij hebben geleden ten gevolge van roof door of overbrenging naar Duitsland.   
F.  De Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, van Frankrijk en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk zullen in de onderscheidenlijk door haar bezette zônes van Duitsland alle nodige maatregelen nemen ter uitvoering van een verdeling, overeenkomstig uw voorafgaande bepalingen.   
G.  Al het monetaire goud, dat in een derde land, waarheen het vanuit Duitsland werd overgemaakt, kan worden achterhaald, zal worden verdeeld overeenkomstig deze regeling betreffende de teruggave van monetair goud.
