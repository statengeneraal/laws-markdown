####AGREEMENT ON GERMAN EXTERNAL DEBTS

*London, 27th February, 1953*  The Governments of Belgium, Canada, Ceylon, Denmark, the French Republic, Greece, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Union of South Africa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, and Yugoslavia of the one part, and The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany of the other part, Desiring to remove obstacles to normal economic relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries and thereby to make a contribution to the development of a prosperous community of nations; Considering that, for about twenty years, payments on German external debts have not, in general, conformed to the contractual terms; that from 1939 to 1945 the existence of a state of war prevented any payments from being made with respect to many of such debts; that since 1945 such payments have been generally suspended; and that the Federal Republic of Germany desires to put an end to this situation; Considering that France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America have, since 8th May, 1945, furnished to Germany economic assistance which has substantially contributed to the rebuilding of the German economy, with the effect of facilitating a resumption of payments on the German external debts; Considering that on 6th March, 1951, an exchange of letters (copies of which are contained in Appendix A to the present Agreement) took place between the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which constitutes the basis on which have been established the present Agreement for the settlement of German external debts (with its Annexes) and the agreements for the settlement of the debts arising out of the economic assistance furnished to Germany; Considering that the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Nothern Ireland and the United States of America set up a Commission entitled the Tripartite Commission on German Debts for the purpose of preparing for and working out, with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, with other interested Governments and with representatives of creditor and debtor interests, a plan for the orderly overall settlement of German external debts; Considering that this Commission informed the representatives of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America were prepared to make important concessions with respect to the priority of their claims for post-war economic assistance over all other foreign claims against Germany and German nationals and with respect to the total amount of these claims, on condition that a satisfactory and equitable settlement of Germany's pre-war external debts was achieved; Considering that such a settlement of German external debts could be achieved only by a single overall plan which would take into account the relative positions of the various creditor interests, the nature of various categories of claims and the general situation of the Federal Republic of Germany; Considering that, in order to achieve this purpose, an International Conference on German External Debts, which was attended by representatives of interested Governments and of creditor and debtor interests, was held in London from 28th February, 1952, to 8th August, 1952; Considering that these representatives made agreed recommendations as to the terms and procedures of settlement (the texts of which are reproduced as Annexes I to VI, inclusive, to the present Agreement); that these recommendations were appended to the Report of the Conference on German External Debts (the text of which is reproduced as Appendix B to the present Agreement); and that the present Agreement has been inspired by the principles and objectives set forth in the above-mentioned Report; Considering that the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, having found that these recommendations provide a satisfactory and equitable plan for the settlement of German external debts, have this day signed with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany bilateral agreements for the settlement of debts arising from the post-war economic assistance furnished by these three Governments which set forth their modified rights and priorities in respect thereto;   Have agreed as follows:

### Article  11  

####Currency of Payment

(1).  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Annexes to the present Agreement, debts without a currency option shall be paid in the currency in which they are payable under the terms of the obligation. If such debts are denominated in German currency and, under the provisions of the Annexes to the present Agreement, are to be paid in a non-German currency, they shall be paid in the currency of the country in which the creditor resides.  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph, any payments agreements from time to time in force between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Government of a creditor country shall apply to debts which, under that sub-paragraph, are to be paid to persons residing in that country in a non-German currency. However, any such payments agreements shall apply to payments on bonded debts payable in a non-German currency other than the currency of the country party to the payments agreement only if the Government of such country agrees that such payments to persons residing in its territory may be made in its own currency.     
(2).  

(a) The question whether payment on debts with a currency option may continue to be required in a currency other than the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or from which credit was advanced shall be determined in a manner to be agreed upon among the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the countries the currencies of which are concerned.  

(b) If a currency option provides for payment of a fixed amount of an alternative currency, the creditor shal be entitled to receive, in the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or from which credit was advanced, the equivalent, at the rate of exchange current on the date payment shall fall due, of such amount of the alternative currency as would have been payable if the option had been exercised.  

(c) Payments on debts with a currency option made, prior to the determination provided for in sub-paragraph (*a*) of this paragraph, in the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or from which the credit was advanced, shall not be affected by such determination.     
(3).  The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply to debts covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 of Annex I to the present Agreement.   
(4).  Any payments agreements from time to time in force between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Government of a creditor country shall apply to payments on debts which are subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article provided that these payments are due in the currency of the creditor country.   
(5).  In the case of debts originating in business transactions of a registered branch office of a creditor, a condition of which was that payment should be made to the country where the branch office is located, such country shall be deemed to be the creditor country within the meaning of this Article.   

### Article  12  

####Treatment of Gold Clauses

In the settlement and discharge of any debt denominated in a non-German currency on a gold basis or with a gold clause, the amount to be paid shall, except as specifically provided otherwise in the Annexes to the present Agreement, be computed as below: 

(a) The amount to be paid on a debt which, under the terms of the obligation existing at the time of the settlement, is denominated or payable in United States dollars or Swiss francs on a gold basis or with a gold clause, shall be determined without regard to such gold basis or gold clause. Any new contract entered into by the creditor and the debtor respecting such debt shall be denominated in United States dollars or in Swiss francs without reference to the value in terms of gold of such currency and shall not contain a gold clause.  

(b) The amount to be paid on a debt which, under the terms of the obligation existing at the time of the settlement, is denominated or payable in any other non-German currency on a gold basis or with a gold clause, shall be determined as follows: 

(i) the equivalent in United States dollars of the nominal amount due shall be calculated at the rate of exchange on the date when the obligation was contracted or, in the case of a bonded debt, when the bonds were issued;  

(ii) the dollar figure so calculated shall be converted into the currency in which the obligation is to be paid in accordance with Article 11 at the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and such currency on the date when the amount payable is due, except that if such rate of exchange is less favourable for the creditor than the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and such currency on 1st August, 1952, the conversion shall be made on the basis of the rate of exchange on 1st August, 1952.      

### Article  13  

####Rates of Exchange

Wherever it is provided in the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto that an amount shall be calculated on the basis of a rate of exchange, such rate shall, except in the cases provided for in Annex III and in Article 8 of Annex IV of the present Agreement; be 

(a) determined by the par values of the currencies concerned in force on the appropriate date as agreed with the International Monetary Fund under Article IV, Section 1, of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund; or  

(b) if no such par values are or were in force on the appropriate date, the rate of exchange agreed for current payments in a bilateral payments agreement between the Governments concerned or their monetary authorities; or  

(c) if neither par values nor rates in bilateral payments agreements are or were in force on the appropriate date, the middle rate of exchange generally applicable for transactions ruling for cable transfers in the currency of the country in which payment is to be made in the principal exchange market of the other country on that date, or on the last date before that date on which such rate was ruling; or  

(d) if there is or was no rate of exchange as specified under (*a*), (*b*) or (*c*) at the appropriate date, the cross-rate of exchange resulting from the middle rates of exchange ruling for the currencies in question in the principal exchange market of a third country dealing in those currencies on that date or the last date before the said date upon which such rates were ruling.    

### Article  14  

####Certain Debts Expressed in German Currency

(1).  The Federal Republic of Germany will take similar action to that provided for in paragraph 6 of Annex I to the present Agreement with respect to any Reichsmark debts for which it has assumed or may assume liability and which are not covered by that paragraph.   
(2).  In application of the principle of national treatment, the Federal Republic of Germany will further ensure that debts arising from Reichsmark bonds, which are not Goldmark debts with a specific foreign character, and which were owed on 21st June, 1948, to persons who on that date were nationals of or residents in a creditor country, and payment on which under legislation in the currency area of the Deutschemark West can be enforced only for a proportionate part, will be met in the same manner as similar liabilities towards persons residing in the currency area of the Deutschemark West.   
(3).  In the settlement of other debts payable in German currency and owed to nationals of creditor countries residing in the currency area of the Deutschemark West, the terms shall be not less favourable than those accorded to similar liabilities owed to any other persons residing in the said area.   

### Article  15  

####Acceptance by Creditors

(1).  Only such creditors shall be entitled to benefit under any provision of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, including payment thereunder, as, in the case of bonded debts for which an offer of settlement is the appropriate procedure, accept the offer, or, in the case of other debts, assent to the establishment in accordance with such provisions of terms of payment and other conditions in respect of such debts,   
(2).  

(a) In the case of bonded debts for which an offer of settlement is the appropriate procedure, the acceptance of the offer of settlement, within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Article, shall be effected by submitting the old bonds or coupons 

(i) for exchange, if new bonds or coupons are issued, or  

(ii) for enfacement, if the settlement terms are to be enfaced on the old bonds or coupons.    

(b) The holder of a bond covered by Annex II of the present Agreement, in respect of which an offer of settlement is made, shall have a period of at least five years from the date when such offer is made to accept such offer. The debtor shall extend this period for a reasonable cause.     
(3).  In the case of debts, other than those referred to in paragraph (2) *(a)* of this Article, the assent of the creditor to the establishment of terms of payment and other conditions within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Article shall, where no definite requirement is laid down in any Annex to the present Agreement, be considered as effected if the creditor clearly indicates his assent in any manner.   
(4).  A debtor shall be subject to the application of the procedures for settlement prescribed in the present Agreement and the relevant Annexes thereto in respect of a debt only when he has made a proposal for settlement, a notification of adherence or a declaration of participation in respect of such debt under the provisions of the relevant Annex to the present Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall, however, be deemed to affect the provisions of Article 17 of the present Agreement.   
(5).  In giving effect to the provisions of Article 2 of the present Agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany shall be entitled to take into account the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs of this Article.   

### Article  16  

####Discharge of Debtors

Whenever a debtor has discharged his debt as settled under the terms of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, he shall be deemed to have thereby also discharged all his obligations in respect of such debt as it existed before the settlement, unless such obligations have been previously extinguished by agreement.  

### Article  17  

####Enforcement of Creditors' Rights

(1).  The Federal Republic of Germany will afford the creditor the right, within the limits of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, to enforce through German courts and authorities 

(a) his rights with respect to a debt as they exist at the time when action is taken under this Article if the creditor and debtor do not agree on terms of settlement and the creditor declares his assent to the establishment by such courts of terms of payment and other conditions for his debt in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto;  

(b) his rights under the terms of settlement of the debt if the debtor fails to discharge his obligations in accordance with such terms (including such rights as under the provisions of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto may be exercised by the creditor upon the failure of the debtor to discharge such obligations), except that the creditor shall not be entitled to the transfer in non-German currency of a principal sum which becomes due as a result of such failure sooner than would have been the case if the debtor had not failed to discharge such obligations.     
(2).  The creditor shall not be afforded the right provided under paragraph (1) of this Article if, under the provisions of the relevant contract or the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, the dispute is, at the time that the right provided for under paragraph (1) of this Article is sought to be exercised, exclusively cognisable by an arbitral body or by a court in a creditor country. When such exclusive jurisdiction is provided by the terms of the relevant contract, the debtor and creditor may by agreement waive such a provision and the creditor shall, thereupon, be entitled to such right.   
3. 
(a) Irrespective of whether there is reciprocity between the country in which the decision is rendered and the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany will afford the creditor the right, subject to the relevant qualifications contained in paragraph (1) and to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this Article, to enforce through German courts and authorities final decisions concerning a debt rendered by courts and arbitral bodies 

(i) in a creditor country after the entry into force of the present Agreement;  

(ii) in a creditor country prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement, if the debtor does not contest the debt as established by such decision.    

(b) A German court, in any other proceeding respecting a debt which has been the subject of a final decision rendered by a court or arbitral body in a creditor country prior to the entry into force of the present Agreement, shall accept as proved the facts upon which such decision was based, unless the debtor introduces evidence to the contrary. In that case the creditor shall be entitled to introduce rebutting evidence including the transcript of evidence in the former proceeding. The amount of a non-contractual pecuniary obligation established by a decision of a German court in a proceeding under this paragraph shall, for the purpose of paragraph (1) (*a*) of Article 4 of the present Agreement, be deemed to have been fixed at the date of the final decision of the court or arbitral body in a creditor country.  

(c) The Federal Republic of Germany will afford the creditor the right, subject to the relevant qualifications contained in paragraph (1) of this Article, to enforce through German courts and authorities final decisions concerning a debt rendered by courts and arbitral bodies within Germany before 8th May, 1945, or within the territory of the currency area of the Deutschemark West after 8th May, 1945.     
(4).  German courts may refuse to enforce a decision of a foreign court or of an arbitral body (except an arbitral body established under the provisions of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto) under the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article in any case in which 

(a) the court which gave the decision had no jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of the arbitral body which gave the decision was not based on the agreement of the parties concerned; or  

(b) the debtor, in the proceedings in the original court or arbitral body, was not afforded an opportunity to defend the proceedings; or  

(c) the enforcement of the decision would be contrary to public policy in the Federal Republic of Germany; provided that the fact that a judgment is not in harmony with the provisions of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto shall not be deemed to make its enforcement, within the limits of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, contrary to public policy within the meaning of this provision.     
(5).  The Federal Republic of Germany will afford Bondholders' Councils or analogous bodies referred to in Annex I and creditors' representatives referred to in Article VIII of Annex II to the present Agreement the right to have established through German courts and authorities the terms of the offer of settlement in the event of the debtor (other than the Federal Republic of Germany) failing to make a proposal for settlement on his existing bonded debt in accordance with the relevant provisions of Annexes I and II to the present Agreement.   
(6).  

(a) A debtor who fails to make a proposal for settlement under Annex I or II to the present Agreement shall not, in any proceeding in a German court brought under paragraph (1), (3) or (5) of this Article, be entitled to the benefit of the provisions respecting hardship contained in paragraph 7 (1) (*e*) of Annex I or paragraph 11 of Article V of Annex II to the present Agreement. When establishing the terms of the offer of settlement or the terms of settlement for the debt, the court shall prescribe the earliest date of maturity which, under the provisions of the relevant Annex, may be applied in settling the debt. The court shall in its judgment award to the plaintiff the expenses referred to in paragraph 7 (*h*) of Annex I to the present Agreement or paragraph 2 of Article X of Annex II to the present Agreement, to be paid by the debtor; such expenses shall be immediately due and payable. The court shall also provide for payment by the debtor of the costs of the proceeding and of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such proceeding either by the creditor of a non-bonded debt or by the Bondholders' Council or analogous body, or by the creditors' representative concerned, in the case of a bonded debt.  

(b) If a debtor fails to effect adherence in accordance with Clause 22 of Annex III to the present Agreement, the creditor concerned shall, in any proceeding brought under paragraph (1) or (3) of this Article, be entitled to enforce his rights in accordance with the provisions of the said Annex, but, in the case of a debt owed by a German Commercial or Industrial Debtor within the meaning of the said Annex (whose debt is direct to the creditor), only after the expiration of thirty days after the first meeting of the Consultative Committee provided for in Clause 17 of the said Annex. When ordering payment of the debt in accordance with the said Annex, the court shall award to the creditor the costs of the proceeding and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by him in such proceeding, to be paid by the debtor.  

(c) A debtor who fails to make a declaration of participation required under Article 14 of Annex IV to the present Agreement shall not, in any proceeding in a German court brought under paragraph (1) or (3) of this Article, be entitled to the benefit of the provisions respecting hardship contained in Article 11 of that Annex. A failure based solely upon a denial of the existence of the debt shall not deprive the debtor of such benefit; provided, however, that if the Court of Law or Court of Arbitration referred to in Article 15 of Annex IV finds that such debt exists, the debtor shall not be entitled to benefit from such clause if he fails to make the required declaration within thirty days from the date of the service of the final decision of such court. In a proceeding under this sub-paragraph in which the debtor is not entitled to benefit from the hardship clause the court shall order the payment by the debtor of court costs and all reasonable fees of the plaintiff's counsel.     
(7).  The Federal Republic of Germany will afford the creditor the right, within the limits of the present Agreement and the Annexes thereto, to enforce through German courts and authorities his claims against a person residing in the currency area of the Deutschemark East out of property owned by such person in the currency area of the Deutschemark West if the claims arise out of obligations which meet the requirements of Article 4 of the present Agreement except as to the residence of the debtor. The right to transfer in foreign currency any sums received by the creditor shall be subject to the foreign exchange regulations from time to time in force in the currency area of the Deutschemark West.   

### Article  18  

####Periods of Prescription

(1).  No debtor shall be entitled to invoke against the establishment of an offer of settlement or against the settlement of a debt the expiration of a period of prescription or of a preclusive period of limitation for the assertion of any claim respecting such debt, which has not expired before 1st June, 1933, earlier than a date determined by treating the running of such respective periods as suspended from 1st June, 1933, until the expiration of eighteen months from the date on which the present Agreement and the relevant Annex thereto become applicable to such debt.   
(2).  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, periods of prescription and preclusive periods of limitation referred to in paragraph (1) which are applicable to the bonded debts specified in Sections A and B of Annex I and to those covered by Annex II to the present Agreement shall not, for the purpose of a settlement, be deemed to have expired before the respective dates on which the offer of settlement made by the debtor ceases to be open for acceptance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 8 (*b*) of Annex I and of Article 15 of the present Agreement.   
(3).  The acceptance of an offer of settlement or an assent to a settlement by the creditor in respect of a debt in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the present Agreement shall effect an interruption of periods of prescription and preclusive periods of limitation for the assertion of a claim respecting such debt.   
(4).  The periods referred to in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this Article shall not include periods for the lodging of an appeal against the decision of a court, arbitral body or an administrative authority, periods covered by Section 12, paragraph 3, of the German Law on Insurance Contracts, or periods provided by the German Laws on the Validation of Bonds.   
(5).  The above provisions shall apply whether the periods have been established by German or other law, by order of a court, of an arbitral body or of an administrative authority, by contract or other legal act. The Federal Republic of Germany will ensure that they are applied in German courts even though the obligation is one which, as to its content, is governed by foreign law.

In view of the present economic and financial position in Germany, it is agreed that the basis for calculating the amount of currency so payable shall be the amount in U.S. dollars to which the payment due in the currency of the country in which the issue was made would have been equivalent at the rates of exchange ruling when the Loan was issued. The nominal amount in U.S. dollars so arrived at will then reconverted into the respective currencies at the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952. Should the rates of exchange ruling any of the currencies of issue on 1st August, 1952, alter thereafter by 5 per cent. or more, the instalments due after that date, while still being made in the currency of the country of issue, shall be calculated on the basis of the least depreciated currency (in relation to the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952) reconverted into the currency of issue at the rate of exchange current when the payment in question becomes due.  

(f) In all respects other than those indicated above, the terms of the original Loan contracts shall be maintained.  

(g) All expenses incidental to carrying out the above modifications of the original contracts shall be borne by the Government of the Federal Republic.    

3.  *The 6 per cent. External (Match) Loan 1930*  

(a) As on the first coupon date following 31st March, 1953, interest at 4 per cent. per annum.  

(b) As on the first coupon date following 31st March, 1958, a sinking fund of 1¼ per cent. shall be added to the above interest payments and constitute with them a cumulative annuity.  

(c) Arrears of interest to be recalculated at 4 per cent. simple interest but otherwise to receive the same treatment as the arrears in respect of the Young Loan.  

(d) The maturity date shall be extended to the year 1994.  

(e) As long as the service of the Match Loan is effected according to the provisions of this Settlement Plan, the Payment for interest and amortisation of the Loan will be made at the office of the Skandinaviska Banken in Stockholm, Sweden, in Swedish Kronor equivalent to the amount due in U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange on the due date.  

(f) In all other respects other than collateral the Match Loan shall have the same treatment as the Young Loan.    

4.  *Konversionskasse Bonds*  The Federal Government will undertake to make the following payments in respect of Konversionskasse Bonds and Scrips:

(b) as on the first coupon date following after 31st March, 1958, a sinking fund of 2 per cent. per annum shall be added to the above interest payments and constitute with them a cumulative annuity;  

(c) the maturity dates of these bonds shall be extended by 17 years from the existing maturity dates;  

(d) two-thirds of the arrears of interest calculated at the contractual rates shall be waived. The remaining one-third shall be funded and carry the same interest and sinking fund as the original Bonds;  

(e) in all other respects the original contracts of these Bonds shall be maintained;  

(f) all expenses incidental to carrying out the above modifications of the original contracts will be borne by the Federal Government;  

(g) Reichsmark Bonds and Scrip will be converted into Deutsche Mark at the rate of 10 : 1.    

5. Certain small liabilities of the Reichsbahn and the Reichspost in foreign currencies other than those covered by Annex IV will be the subject of negotiation between the Federal Government and the creditors.  

6.  *Debts in Reichsmarks of the Reich, the Reichsbahn, the Reichspost and the State of Prussia*  In response to the request of the creditors' representatives the Federal Government will undertake 

(a) to extend at their request and in application of the principle of national treatment to foreign creditors the benefit of the advantages and compensations which have been or may ultimately be granted in connection with the monetary reform to German creditors;  

(b) to extend to foreign creditors at the time of the enactment of any future German law relative to the conversion and settlement of debts the benefit of the most favourable treatment provided by this law for German creditors;  

(c) if the law mentioned in paragraph *(b)* above is not promulgated before 1st January, 1954, or does not cover all categories of debts, to open before 1st April, 1954, negotiations with the foreign creditors' representatives in course of which these representatives reserve the right to ask for a special settlement of these debts. The present undertaking applies to all Reichsmark debts of the Reich, the Reichsbahn and the Reichspost whether represented by Bonds (Treasury Bills, obligations of the Ablösungsanleihen, &c.) or not so represented.  

(d) The Federal Government further undertakes to extend the same treatment to the future service of the Reichsmark liabilities of the State of Prussia.     
###B. *External Bonds issued or guaranteed by the States (Länder), Municipalities and similar public bodies within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany*

7. The respective debtors shall pay to be transferred by the Federal Government the following amounts: 

(1)  *Bonds other than those of the State of Prussia*  

(a) As on the first coupon date following after 31st March, 1953, 75 per cent. of the original contractual interest (subject to a minimum of 4 per cent. per annum and a maximum of 5¼ per cent. per annum) or the rate specified in the original contract if less than 4 per cent. per annum;  

(b) interest at the same rates on two-thirds of any arrears of interest (other than interest already covered by Konversionskasse Bonds or similar agreed arrangements); these arrears shall be funded;  

(c) as on the first coupon dates following after 31st March, 1958, a sinking fund of 1 per cent. per annum, to be increased on 31st March, 1963, to 2 per cent. in the case of loans maturing in 1968 or after shall be added to the above interest payments and constitute with them a cumulative annuity;  

(d) the maturity dates of these Loans shall be extended by 20 years from the existing maturity dates;  

(e) in respects other than those indicated above, the terms of the original loan contracts shall be maintained unless otherwise agreed by the creditor in special circumstances. Where exceptional circumstances peculiar to a particular debtor are such as to satisfy the creditors' representatives that it is impracticable for that debtor to conform to the general arrangement, such adjustment as may seem necessary shall be made by agreement between the debtor and the creditors' representatives.  

(f) Bonds issued and payable outside of the territory of the Federal Republic denominated in Reichsmark shall be converted, at the rate of 10 : 1, into Deutsche Mark. They will carry interest at the original contractual rate. Arrears of interest shall be funded on the same basis and shall carry the same rate of interest. The bonds shall be extended for a period of 15 years after the maturity date, and will be redeemable in equal annuities, the first being due on the first coupon maturity date in 1958. Interest and redemption moneys will be transferred in the currency of the country where the bondholder has his residence.  

(g) Reference to an “original contract” or to an “original contractual interest” shall be read as reference to the contract or the relative contractual interest subsisting between creditor and debtor at the time when the borrowing was first made or the obligation was first incurred, unless a conversion (herein called an “effective conversion”) was made before 9th June, 1933, or was made on or after that date on account of the insolvency or threatened insolvency of the debtor or as a result of free negotiation; provided that 

(i) in disputed cases the decision shall lie with a Court of Arbitration where the burden shall be on the debtor to prove that the arrangement was freely negotiated, and  

(ii) arrangements made where the German Custodian of Enemy Property or a person appointed by a German authority in an occupied territory represented the creditors or resulting from mere acceptance by the creditor of a unilateral offer made by the debtor shall be presumed not to have been freely negotiated.   In calculating future interest and arrears of interest under the general formula, the original contractual rate shall apply. Where, however, an effective conversion has taken place the converted rate of interest shall apply; provided that in such case the converted rate shall not be subject to any reduction either as to arrears of interest or as to future interest, unless the debtor prefers calculation on the basis of the original contractual rate under the general formula.  

(h) All expenses incidental to carrying out the above modifications of the original contracts shall be borne by the debtors.  

(i) Where the remaining capital amount of the total of all bond issues in foreign currency of a particular debtor is small, the debtor may offer an earlier repayment and final settlement of the entire amount of such indebtedness and arrears of interest without regard to the limitations and provisions under *(d)* above relative to the prolongation of the indebtedness.  

(j) All corporate obligations guaranteed by a State, city, municipality or other governmental body shall be settled in accordance with “Agreed Recommendations for the Settlement of Medium and Long-Term German Debts resulting from private capital transactions” (Annex II) provided that such guarantees shall continue in force in accordance with its terms. <sup> (1)  See Annex VII.  </sup>

(i) The Federal Government will issue new dollar bonds bearing first coupon dated 1st April, 1953, and maturing in twenty years, in the same denominations as the outstanding bonds of the above issues bearing interest at the rate of 4 per cent., payable semi-annually on 1st April and 1st October. On 1st April, 1958, a sinking fund of 1 per cent. per annum shall be added to the above interest rate and constitute with it a cumulative annuity. The debtor may call bonds by lot at par or may purchase bonds in the open market or otherwise and may provide additional amortisation as long as the service is maintained in accordance with the Contract.  

(ii) Outstanding coupons on the old issues bearing dates from 15th March, 1933, to 31st December, 1936, will be extended for a period of twenty years, and upon such extended maturity 50 per cent. of the amount thereof shall be paid in United States dollars on the corresponding dates in 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956.  

(iii) Coupons maturing on or after 1st January, 1937, shall receive no payment until such time as territories formerly belonging to the State of Prussia and now outside the territory of the Federal Republic shall be joined to the Federal Republic, at which time payment shall be the subject of negotiation.  

(iv) All expenses incidental to carrying out the above shall be borne by the Federal Government.    

(b) As to the 4½ per cent.

(3) *Non-Bonded Indebtedness* (other than that covered by Annex IV) The terms of paragraph 7 (1) will apply, *mutatis mutandis,* service starting from 1st January, 1953. In the settlement of Mark claims regard will be had to the relevant provisions of Annex IV to the Agreement on German External Debts.     
###C. *General Provisions*

(a) The terms of the proposals may be enfaced on existing bonds or new bonds issued in exchange for existing bonds, and new bonds or fractional scrip issued for arrears of interest, depending upon the convenience and custom prevailing in the several markets in which the bonds were originally issued. Such enfaced bonds or new bonds will conform to prevailing market practice. The debtors at their own expense will employ suitable banking institutions for the purposes of carrying out the details of the proposal.

2.  *Amortisations*  Amortisation of the total amount to be established will be made either by acquisition of bonds or by payment in cash with respect to payments effected by debtors 

(a) from the *Saar territory,* in full;  

(b) from *Austria, France, Luxembourg and Belgium* at the rate of 60 per cent. of the debtors' payments;   in five equal annual instalments, starting on 1st July, 1953, and thereafter on 1st July of each of the following four years.

Payment to be made in cash, the principles of Part I above applying *mutatis mutandis,* in five equal instalments, starting on 1st July, 1953, and thereafter on 1st July of each of the following four years. Should the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany be unable to obtain by 1st July, 1953, an overall survey of the total amount to be paid, it may begin payments not later than six months after that date. For the purpose of ascertaining the total amount of liabilities in question, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will by public notice request the creditors and the debtors to notify the Konversionskasse für Deutsche Auslandsschulden of any claims not settled and of any payments made to the Konversionskasse respectively, and to submit to the Konversionskasse any existing documents substantiating such notification. The Konversionskasse für Deutsche Auslandsschulden in Berlin will be instructed to register liabilities due for consideration. 
###III. *Small Amounts*

The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany may at its discretion effect payments for very small amounts in respect of bonded debts or other debts within a shorter period. I should be much obliged if you would confirm that the foregoing proposal is a correct statement of the agreement reached by us and can, therefore, form the subject of the envisaged exchange of letters. Please accept, Sir, the expression of my highest esteem. Yours very sincerely, (sd) ABS.  *Council of Foreign Bondholders,*   *17 Moorgate,*   *London, E.C. 2,*   *18th November, 1952.*  Dear Mr. Abs, I have to thank you for your letter of the 14th November with regard to the settlement of the Konversionskasse Receipts referred to in paragraph 14 *(c)* of the Report of the Committee A. <sup> (1)  Appendix 3 to the Conference Report (Annex I to the Agreement).  </sup> It is my understanding that the words at the top of page 2 should read “bis zum *Ende* des Jahres 1941” and that “am ersten auf den 31.

### Article  I  

####Introductory

This Agreement establishes terms and procedures which are to govern the settlement of the debts described in Article III below. The Agreement does not in itself modify the terms of the debts to which it applies. Rather, it is contemplated that new contracts will be entered into between each debtor and his creditors pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. The new contracts shall retain the terms of the existing contracts unless modified by arrangements between creditor and debtor within the framework of this Agreement.  

### Article  II  

####Definitions

Wherever used in this Agreement, the following terms shall, unless the context requires otherwise, have the meanings indicated below: Original contract - the contract entered into at the time the loan was first made. Existing contract - the original contract, except in the case of a contract which has been the subject of an effective conversion or conversions, in which case the existing contract is the contract resulting from the last effective conversion. Effective conversion - a change made in the terms of a loan contract before 9th June, 1933, or made on or after that date on account of the insolvency or threatened insolvency of the debtor or as a result of free negotiation; provided that 

(a) in any dispute as to whether or not a change was freely negotiated it shall be presumed that any arrangement made where the German Custodian of Enemy Property represented the creditor, or which resulted from the mere acceptance by the creditor of a unilateral offer made by the debtor, was not freely negotiated;  

(b) in any disputed case the burden shall be on the debtor to prove that the conversion was an effective conversion;  

(c) in the case of Church loans, any conversion shall be considered effective.   Creditor - includes any creditors' representative designated pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement. Germany - all territory within the German Reich on 1st January, 1937. Resident in - having ordinary residence (mit gewöhnlichem Aufenthalt oder Sitz) in; a juridical person shall be deemed to have its ordinary residence in the Federal Republic of Germany or Berlin (West) if it is entered in the Commercial Register in that territory.  

### Article  III  

####Debts Covered

1.  The present Agreement applies to every bonded loan and to every non-bonded loan issued or raised outside Germany, if 

(a) the loan was made prior to 8th May, 1945; and  

(b) under the original contract the loan was to run for a period of five years or more; and  

(c) the debtor is a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, bank, church, welfare institution, or other non-governmental institution; and  

(d) the debtor is, on 1st January, 1953, or on any later date when his creditors request an offer of settlement, resident in the German Federal Republic or in Berlin (West); and  

(e) the loan is denominated in non-German currency, or is denominated in German currency and contains a non-German currency or gold clause.     
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, the present Agreement shall not be applicable to 

(i) the following categories of debts, which require separate treatment: 

(a) debts of public utilities located in and controlled by the City of Berlin;  

(b) debts owed by a debtor to any person or persons who, directly or indirecty, own such debtor;  

(c) debts in respect of loans the original amount of which, converted at the exchange rate prevailing on 1st July, 1952, was less than U.S. $ 40,000;  

(d) debts subject to the Swiss-German Agreements of 6th December, 1920, and 25th March, 1923 (the so-called Schweizer Frankengrundschulden);    

(ii) the debts of the jointly owned German-Swiss Boundary power plants on the Rhine. There are outstanding three bonded loans and two non-bonded loans which are owed by German companies to Swiss bondholders and other creditors. Owing to certain special features relating to the operation of jointly-owned power plants along the Rhine, the settlement of these debts is bound up with other issues. Considering these circumstances, the final settlement (upon which it is impossible to agree at this time) is left for direct negotiations between Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany. However the creditors agree that, in negotiating such a settlement, they will not ask for payment of an annual amount exceeding 5 million Swiss francs in the first five years after 1st January, 1953.     
3.  No debt shall be excluded solely because a new debtor becomes or has become liable for it, by operation of law or otherwise, either before or after 8th May, 1945. For example, no debt of an enterprise subject to Allied High Commission Law No. 27, “Reorganisation of the German Coal and Iron and Steel Industries,” shall be excluded by virtue of the assumption of such debt by unit or other successor companies.   
4.  This Agreement shall not apply to individual bonds or coupons which require validation under the German Validation Law of 19th August, 1949, (Wirtschaftsgesetzbl. p. 295), and the German Validation Law for Foreign Bonds of August, 1952, until such bonds or coupons shall have been validated pursuant to the provisions of any such law and of any intergovernmental agreement which may be entered into which the country of issue respecting such law.   
5.  The problem of the debts of the German Central Bank for Agriculture (Deutsche Rentenbank Kreditanstalt) is complicated by various factors. As a result of the partition of Germany the assets invested in East Germany are presently uncollectable by the Bank, and to that extent the amount of debt covered by this Agreement is reduced by varying amounts as fixed by existing regulations, the percentage being different in each case and ranging from 20 per cent. to 67 per cent. of the outstanding loans. The German representatives stated that the Federal Government do not at present have the power to alter this situation, which results in particular from the relevant regulations under the currency conversion legislation. They do agree that the Federal Government shall do everything in its power to facilitate the settlement of the debts of the Bank and the payment of interest and amortisation as provided under the said Laws and Regulations. The creditors' representatives reserve the right of the creditors to take such action as may be open to them to rectify what they consider to be a settlement prejudicial to and discriminatory as between different classes of creditors. It is understood that the Bank retains its liability to the creditors in respect of the indebtedness secured by assets in East Germany and will service that liability as and when those assets become available to it. There are several other institutions in a similar position where the same principles should be applied.   
6.  In dealing with the Potash Loan in any plan of settlement under the provisions of this Agreement, there will need to be considered the special features of this loan.   

### Article  IV  

####Outstanding Amount of Debt

1.  The outstanding amount of any debt is the unpaid principal and all unpaid interest due up to 1st January, 1953, such interest to be computed as simple interest at the rate established in the existing contract, regardless of whether the debt has matured before that date and regardless of the effect of any default under the existing contract prior to that date.   
2.  An amount is unpaid within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article if it has not been received and accepted expressly or implicitly by the creditor. Acceptance by the creditor of funding bonds, scrip or cash from the Konversionskasse constitutes payment of any debt, or of any part of a debt, in respect of which they were accepted.   

### Article  V  

####Settlement Terms

1.   *Principal*  There shall be no reduction in the outstanding principal amount.   
2.   *Foreign Currency Debts with Gold Clauses*  

(a) Gold dollars and gold Swiss francs. In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs, the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollar equalling 1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 gold Swiss franc, and the new contracts shall be expressed in currency dollars or currency Swiss francs respectively.  

(b) Other currencies with gold clauses. In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding German currency debts with gold clauses - see paragraph 3 below) the amounts due shall be payable only in the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or the issue was made (below referred to as “the currency of issue”), the amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rate of exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in U.S. dollars which shall be arrived at by converting the amount of the obligation expressed in the currency of issue into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange ruling when the loan was raised or the issue made. The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be less than if it were computed at the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952.     
3.   *German Currency Debts with Gold Clauses*  

(a) The principle is accepted that such financial debts and mortgages, expressed in Gold Marks or in Reichsmarks with a gold clause, as had a specific foreign character shall be converted into Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 Goldmark, or 1 Reichsmark with a gold clause, = 1 Deutsche Mark.  

(b) The definition of the criteria constituting the specific foreign character of the above indebtedness shall be the subject of further negotiation . Both sides reserve their position as to the question in which cases and in which way the above principle can be implemented. It shall lie with the German Delegation to decide how the solution arrived at can be fitted into the framework of the German laws on currency reform and on the equalisation of war and post-war burdens. <sup> (1)  See now Annex VII.  </sup>  

(c) The above-mentioned negotiation between a German delegation and creditor delegates shall take place not later than 31st October, 1952.     
4.   *Arrears of Interest*  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 below, two-thirds of the unpaid interest to 1st January, 1953, shall be funded and one-third waived. Such funded interest together with the unpaid principal shall constitute the new principal amount.   
5.   *Future Rate of Interest*  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 below, interest shall run from 1st January, 1953, irrespective of the date when the new contract is entered into pursuant to this Agreement, at 75 per cent. of the rate of interest provided for in the existing contract. Such new current rate of interest, however, shall not exceed 5¼ per cent. on bonded debts and 6 per cent. on non-bonded indebtedness, nor shall it be below 4 per cent., except that in cases where the interest rate provided for in the existing contract is below 4 per cent. the rate provided for in the existing contract shall be paid.   
6.   *Interest Rate in Cases where there has been an Effective Conversion*  In the case of any debt which has been the subject of an effective conversion the debtor shall elect either 

(a) to fund all unpaid interest outstanding under the existing contract to 1st January, 1953, and to pay interest from that date at the full rate provided in the existing contract, or  

(b) to fund unpaid interest and to pay future interest as though the original contract were still in force and paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article were applicable.     
7.   *Payment of Interest*  Interest for the period beginning 1st January, 1953, shall be payable at least semi-annually. Appropriate adjustment shall be made in any case where the new contract is not entered into until after 1st January, 1954, if the debtor cannot reasonably be expected to pay at once all interest due in respect of the period between 1st January, 1953, and the date the new contract is entered into.   
8.   *Amortisation Payments*  

(a) Amortisation shall be paid annually from 1958 to 1962 at an annual rate of 1 per cent. of the new principal amount and thereafter until the maturity date at an equal rate of 2 per cent. of such new principal amount. Amortisation payments for each year after 1958 shall be increased by the amount of one year's interest on all debt retired by means of the amortisation payments for previous years excluding, however, debt retired by means of payments made pursuant to sub-paragraph (*d*) below.  

(b) Amortisation payments shall be made on the first interest payment date in any given year. If the first interest payment date in 1958 does not fall on 1st January, the first amortisation payment shall be calculated for the period from 1st January, 1957, to such interest payment date, and the same principle shall apply when the annual rate of 2 per cent. comes into operation.  

(c) All such amortisation shall be applied to the reduction of the new principal amount. In the case of bond issues the amortisation payments shall be applied to the retirement of bonds through call by lot at the par or face value unless otherwise agreed between the debtor and his creditors.  

(d) As long as the service is maintained in accordance with the new contract, additional amortisation may be made by the debtor in any manner, including acquisition of bonds whether in the open market or otherwise.     
9.   *Maturity*  The new contract shall establish a maturity date not less than 10 years nor more than 25 years from 1st January, 1953. The new maturity date must be agreed upon between the debtor and his creditors. The debtor should offer the earliest maturity date, within the above limits, which is practicable in view of his particular circumstances. It is comtemplated that maturities of 10 to 15 years, or in exceptional cases up to 20 years, should be accorded to industrial debtors, banks and churches; public utilities and basic industries, however, may extend their maturities to 20 years, but not in excess of 25 years in any case; and in the case of non-bonded debt the normal maturity shall be 10 years.   
10.   *Repayment of Small Amounts of Indebtedness*  Wherever the outstanding amount of a debt is very small or is small compared to the amount of the original loan, agreements may be entered into for an earlier repayment and final disposition of the entire amount of such indebtedness and arrears of interest without regard to the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Article.   
11.   *Hardship Cases*  Wherever owing to extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to a loss of assets in Germany outside the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West), affecting the financial position of a debtor, it becomes impossible or impracticable for him to make an offer for a new contract on the terms specified in this Agreement, agreements between the debtor and his creditors making such adjustments as may be deemed necessary in the light of the particular circumstances shall not be precluded.   
12.   *Security*  Subject to other applicable provisions of law, the provisions of the existing contract for liens and collateral and any other type of security for the protection of creditors shall remain in force, but in so far as the security provided under the existing contract no longer corresponds in its nature or extent with the new principal amount of the debt or no longer corresponds with the circumstances prevailing at the time the new contract is entered into, the debtor may propose a change in the nature or extent of the security. The security proposed by the debtor shall, however, be fully adequate and must be acceptable to the creditor. To the extent that the security has been impaired or substantially altered the debtor shall make such readjustments as are necessary to provide his creditors with at least the degree of protection originally afforded. The creditor may demand, and his debtor shall provide, reasonable security or other protective provisions acceptable to the creditor.   
13.   *Reserves and Sinking Funds*  Because the amortisation payments are only to commence in 1958 and then at the relatively low rate of 1 per cent., and in 1963 increase to only 2 per cent., the debtor shall pursue a policy of assuring a sufficiently strong liquid financial position in order to meet his obligations at maturity. Therefore, additional provisions should be discussed between creditors and debtors which may provide for the establishment of reserves or sinking funds for the debts under which an annual amount, calculated either as a percentage of the net earnings prior to dividend payments or otherwise as may be agreed, shall be set aside.   
14.   *Provision of Foreign Exchange*  The debtor shall make the arrangements required under German law for the provision of the necessary foreign exchange to discharge all obligations under the new contract.   
15.   *Default of the Debtor*  In the event of default, in addition to any penalties for default provided in the new contract, the creditor shall be entitled, for the period of the default, to receive interest at the rate provided in the existing contract.   
16.   *Modification of Terms*  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any debtor from obtaining, with the consent of his creditors, terms more favourable to the debtor than those specified in this Agreement.   
17.   *Concessions for Benefit of Debtors*  The creditors consider that the concessions made by them under this Agreement should accrue to the benefit of the debtors.   

### Article  VI  

####Miscellaneous Provisions affecting Debts

1.   *Repayment in German Currency*  Any debtor may arrange at the request of any of his creditors for repayment of a debt or part thereof in German currency.   
2.   *Change of Creditor*  Apart from the case of bonds, the creditor may assign to some other person ordinarily resident outside the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West) his claim or a substantial part thereof provided that the assignment 

(a) is made to a resident in the same currency area,  

(b) does not entail any modification of the conditions underlying the claim,  

(c) does not result indirectly or directly in settlement of the claim.     
3.   *Change of Debtor*  The German Foreign Exchange Control Authorities will favourably consider applications for the taking over of an existing debt by a new German debtor, and for the replacement of existing pledged security by a new security.   

### Article  VII  

####Procedure for Negotiation of New Contracts

1.  The provisions of and the technical details relating to the new contracts to be entered into between creditors and their debtors shall be included in an offer of settlement to be made by the debtor.   
2.  All proposed agreements, contracts or indentures shall be subject to approval as to form and content by legal counsel for the creditors if they so desire.   
3.  Each debtor shall, prior to 30th June, 1953, or within six months of his taking up residence in the Federal Republic of Germany or in Berlin (West), prepare and submit to his creditor a detailed offer of settlement. The creditor may request his debtor to enter into negotiations with him regarding any aspect of the offer, and the debtor shall enter into such negotiations.   
4.  The term creditor, as used in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, shall in the case of any bond issue mean the creditors' representative appointed pursuant to Article VIII.   
5.  In the case of bonded indebtedness, the terms of the settlement may be enfaced on existing bonds or new bonds may be issued in exchange for existing bonds, and new bonds or fractional scrip exchangeable for bonds may be issued for arrears of interest, depending upon the convenience and prevailing custom in the respective markets in which the bonds were issued. Enfaced bonds or new bonds shall conform to prevailing market practice. The debtor, at his own expense, shall employ suitable banking institutions for the purpose of carrying out the settlement and shall meet all requirements of governmental authorities and securities markets in order to ensure marketability.   

### Article  VIII  

####Creditor Representation

The Committees and organisations whose delegates participated in the Conference on German External Debts as representatives of the various national groups of creditors affected by this Agreement (such Committees and organisations being hereinafter referred to as “Creditor Committees”) shall, subject to the right of approval of their respective Governments, appoint as creditors' representatives such persons or organisations as may be required to forward and bring about settlements between particular debtors and their creditors pursuant to this Agreement, or may themselves act in such capacity. Not more than one representative or representative organisation shall be appointed in any particular case, except that, where deemed necessary by the Creditor Committees in order to protect fully the rights of the holders of different issues of bonds of a particular debtor, there may be appointed not more than one representative or representative organisation for each such issue. The German debtor is entitled to request the Creditor Committees to appoint representatives. Participation in the Debt Conference shall not bar any person from serving in any capacity in any negotiations entered into pursuant to this Agreement.  

### Article  IX  

####Arbitration and Mediation Committee

1.   *Jurisdiction*  In order to forward the settlements between individual debtors and their creditors, an Arbitration and Mediation Committee shall be established. The duty of this Committee shall be to mediate and arbitrate between the debtor and his creditors in the event that they are not able to agree between themselves as to the terms of the offer of settlement to be made. Either party shall have the right to refer a disputed point to the Committee. The decision of the Committee shall be binding on both parties. The debtor shall be obliged to offer to his creditors the terms set forth in such decision. The creditor shall be obliged to accept such terms , or, in the case of a bond issue where the bondholders are represented pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement, the creditors' representative shall be obliged to recommend acceptance of the offer by the bondholders. <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup> Where a creditors' representative has been appointed pursuant to such Article VIII, the rights of the creditors under this Article shall be exercised by such representative.   
2.   *Composition*  The Committee shall be composed of four members appointed by the creditors and four members appointed by the debtors. The Committee may elect a further member for any particular case upon request of a majority of its members. The Chairman of the Committee shall be elected from among the creditor members. The first Chairman shall be the United States member. For each member an alternate may be designated. Each member of the Committee including the Chairman shall have one vote.   
3.   *Appointment of Members*  The members of the Committee shall be appointed as follows: 

(a) The creditor members shall be appointed by organisations designated by the respective Creditor Committees of the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland and the Netherlands. At the request of the Creditor Committee of a country whose creditors are specially concerned in a particular case, a member appointed by the Creditor Committee in that country shall replace one of these members as his alternate.  

(b) The debtor members shall be appointed by the Head of the German Delegation on External Debts.     
4.   *Procedure*  The Committee may set up sub-committees for any particular case and may appoint temporary members to sit on such sub-committees. The manner of submitting disputes, the times and places of hearing, the manner of giving notice of hearings, and all other matters relating to the procedure or administration of the Committee or its sub-committees shall be determined by the Committee.   
5.   *Costs*  Members of the Committee and temporary members shall be reimbursed for all travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties and shall receive in addition remuneration to be established by the Committee for all time spent in connection with the performance of their duties. All expenses and costs incurred by the Committee or its members or temporary members in a given dispute shall be borne by the particular German debtor involved. In any case, however, where the Committee or the appropriate sub-committee determines that resort to the Committee has not been made in good faith by a creditor or that the appeal is frivolous the costs and expenses shall be borne by such creditor to the extent directed by the Committee or sub-committee. All other expenses of the Committee and its members, including compensation to the members when engaged in Committee affairs, shall be refunded by the debtors by assessment or otherwise.   

### Article  X  

####Expenses of Creditors, Creditor Representatives and Others

1.  The debtors affected by this Agreement shall pay all expenses incurred in connection with the Debt Conference or in the general execution of this Agreement by any Creditor Committee.   
2.  Expenses incurred by the creditors in connection with negotiations between a debtor and his creditors pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement shall be borne by the debtor involved. Such expenses and compensation shall be paid, in the case of non-bonded debt, to the creditors and, in the case of bonded debt, to the creditors' representatives appointed pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement.   
3.  The term expenses, as used in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, includes reasonable compensation for services. Any dispute as to the reasonableness of expenses payable under this Article may be referred to the Arbitration and Mediation Committee.   
4.  Payments provided for in this Article shall not stand in the way of or bar any creditors' representative from making and collecting additional charges from the bondholders or creditors.   

### Article  XI  

####Entry into Force

No payments may be made, under the terms of any settlement offer made pursuant to this Agreement, prior to the date of entry into force pf the contemplated Intergovernmental Agreement on German External Debts. Nevertheless, the debtors shall proceed expeditiously to prepare and present offers of settlement to their creditors in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of this Agreement, to conduct such negotiations as may be necessary, and otherwise to take all steps to forward the preparation of the new offers contemplated hereunder.  

####SUB-ANNEX TO ANNEX II

*Interpretation of the second paragraph of Section 1 of Article IX of Annex II*   

The Tripartite Commission on German Debts, 29 Chesham Place, S.W. 1.  *12th November, 1952.*  Gentlemen, Our attention has been drawn to a misunderstanding which has arisen as to the meaning of the second paragraph of Section 1 of Article IX of Appendix 4 to the Report of the Conference on German External Debts. This paragraph reads: “. . . . The decision of the Committee shall be binding on both parties. The debtor shall be obliged to offer to his creditors the terms set forth in such decision. The creditor shall be obliged to *accept such terms,* or, in the case of a bond issue where the bondholders are represented pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement, the creditors' representative shall be obliged to recommend acceptance of the offer by the bondholders. . . . .” The words in italics, “accept such terms,” have given rise to the misunderstanding. The proper interpretation would be clear if they were replaced by the words: “recognise such terms as being in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.” We shall be grateful if the Tripartite Commission will take note that the above-quoted second paragraph of Section 1 of Article IX of Appendix 4 properly has the sense it would have if it were expressed in this changed wording, *i.e.,* if it read: “The decision of the Committee shall be binding on both parties. The Debtor shall be obliged to offer to his creditors the terms set forth in such decision, and the creditor shall be obliged to *recognise such terms as being in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,* or, in the case of a bond issue where the bondholders are represented pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement, the creditors' representative shall be obliged to recommend acceptance of the offer by the bondholders.” Yours faithfully, (sd) N. LEGGETT. Chairman of Negotiating Committee B at the Conference on German External Debts. (sd) HERMANN J. ABS. Head of the German Delegation for External Debts.

Supplementary understandings reached by the parties with respect to this Annex after the close of the Conference are attached hereto as a Sub-Annex.]*  *Agreed Recommendations for the Settlement of Standstill Debts: The German Credit Agreement of 1952*  *AGREEMENT* made between a COMMITTEE representative of BANKING, COMMERCIAL and INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS in THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC of GERMANY and the WESTERN SECTORS of BERLIN (hereinafter referred to as “the German Committee” which expression shall include any institution or body succeeding to any of its functions relevant to this Agreement), the BANK DEUTSCHER LAENDER (which shall include any institution or body succeeding to any of its functions relevant to this Agreement) and such of the following Committees (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Foreign Bankers' Committees”) as become signatories hereto, namely COMMITTEES representative of BANKING INSTITUTIONS carrying on business in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM and SWITZERLAND respectively Whereas: 

(1) An Agreement for the maintenance of short-term banking credits to Germany which came into force on the 17th September, 1931, was entered into by foreign banking creditors in response to the request of the Seven-Power Conference, which met in London in July 1931, that “the foreign banking creditors of Germany should take concerted measures with a view to maintaining the volume of credits they had already extended to Germany” and in reliance on the declaration by that Conference that “in order to ensure the maintenance of the financial stability of Germany, which is essential in the interests of the whole world,” the Governments concerned “were ready to co-operate, so far as lies within their power, to restore confidence.”  

(2) Maintenance of such short-term banking credits was continued by successive annual Agreements, the latest of which (hereinafter referred to as “the 1939 Agreement”) was due to expire on 31st May, 1940, but, in consequence of the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and the United Kingdom and its Allies, was terminated on 4th September, 1939, by notice given on behalf of the Committees representative of the banking creditors in the U.S.A. and England in accordance with the conditions of that Agreement.  

(3) Following the termination of the 1939 Agreement certain Agreements were entered into between the American Creditors' Committee and the appropriate German parties in 1939 and 1940 for the continued maintenance (with certain restrictions and modifications) of such of the said short-term banking credits as had been granted by the foreign banking creditors in the U.S.A., the second of which Agreements expired on 31st May, 1941.  

(4) Following the termination of the 1939 Agreement certain other Agreements were entered into between the Swiss Creditors' Committee and the appropriate German parties for the continued maintenance (with certain restrictions and modifications) of such of the said short-term banking credits as had been granted by foreign banking creditors in Switzerland but all such Agreements have since expired.  

(5) In accordance with the conditions of the latest of the previous Agreements applicable thereto, all indebtedness arising under the said short-term banking credits to Germany matured on the expiration of the respective Agreement with the effects stipulated therein and all such indebtedness (including indebtedness arising under certain credits which were granted in substitution for short-term credits formerly governed by one or more of the previous Agreements) then became due and payable by the respective debtors (together with interest and other charges accrued and accruing thereon) in the relative foreign currencies and is still so due and payable except to the extent that the said indebtedness has meanwhile been discharged or reduced by payment or satisfaction in either foreign or German currency. No provision has yet been made to enable the remainder of such indebtedness to be discharged in the respective currencies of the debts.  

(6) Banking, commercial and industrial concerns in the Federal Republic through the German Committee have requested their foreign banking creditors to enter into a new Agreement for regulating payment of the outstanding short-term indebtedness and for establishing means for the restoration of normal conditions for financing the foreign trade of the Federal Republic and in response to such request appropriate provisions have been formulated and embodied in this Agreement and it has been agreed by the Foreign Bankers' Committees to recommend foreign banking creditors in their respective countries to adhere to this Agreement.  

(7) This Agreement has been executed by the Foreign Bankers' Committees upon the terms that so long as this Agreement remains in force, there shall be promulgated and maintained such legislation and regulations by the Government of the Federal Republic or other appropriate authority as may be necessary to render its provisions effective and that no legislation or regulations substantially affecting the obligations of this Agreement shall be promulgated and in particular that the legislation to be so promulgated and maintained shall ensure that <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup> 

(i) There will be no discrimination on the part of banking, commercial or industrial concerns in the Federal Republic in the making of repayment or the giving of security as between their foreign banking creditors whether adhering to this Agreement or not;  

(ii) There will be no discrimination on the part of banking, commercial or industrial concerns in the Federal Republic in the giving of security as between their creditors in the Federal Republic and their foreign banking creditors whether adhering to this Agreement or not; <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup>  

(iii) Unauthorised movements of capital shall be prevented; and <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup>

(3).  The declaration in the Federal Republic of a general foreign moratorium in whatever form shall *ipso facto* determine this Agreement.   

### 3  

####Maintenance of Credits, etc.

(1).  During the period of this Agreement the right of any Foreign Bank Creditor to repayment of short-term credits with respect to which he has adhered to this Agreement shall be postponed until the termination of this Agreement, except that such Foreign Bank Creditor shall be entitled to any earlier payment granted or permitted by any Clause of this Agreement. Every German Debtor by adhering hereto agrees that all short-term credits with respect to which he adheres shall be due and payable in full in the relative foreign currency on the termination of this Agreement, subject to such reductions as shall have been made prior to such termination pursuant to any of the provisions hereof.   
(2).  Neither the execution of this Agreement nor anything contained herein shall operate to prejudice any of the rights and obligations of a Foreign Bank Creditor and his German Debtor in respect of a short-term credit which have arisen 

(i) as a result of any act or thing done or omitted by the German Debtor for the benefit of the Foreign Bank Creditor during the period from the termination of the latest of the previous Agreements applicable to the relative short-term credit and the coming into force of this Agreement, or  

(ii) as a result of the exercise by the Foreign Bank Creditor of any rights or powers available to him during the period mentioned in the last foregoing paragraph.   By adhering to this Agreement in respect of any short-term credit the Foreign Bank Creditor shall be deemed to ratify and confirm any action taken by his German Debtor for the benefit of such Foreign Bank Creditor as specified in the foregoing paragraph (i) and such ratification shall be deemed to have had effect at the time when the relative action was taken.   
(3).  The ratification provided in the preceding sub-Clause shall not apply to any payments made by any German Debtor in German currency other than payments made to or for the account of the Foreign Bank Creditor with his express consent.   
(4).  With respect to any short-term credit or part thereof in regard to which a German Bank Debtor was required pursuant to sub-Clause (1) of Clause 7 of the 1939 Agreement (or corresponding provisions of any subsequent Agreement) to obtain from its client an *eigene Wechsel* or letter of guarantee, such Bank Debtor shall upon his adherence to this Agreement procure for the Foreign Bank Creditor a new *eigene Wechsel* or (at the option of the Foreign Bank Creditor) a new letter of guarantee dated not earlier than the date of this Agreement and shall hold the same for or forward it to the Foreign Bank Creditor as required by the said sub-Clause (or corresponding provisions). Such letter of guarantee shall contain an obligation of the client to reimburse the German Bank Debtor in the form and to the extent demanded by such Bank Debtor in the event that such Bank Debtor voluntarily repays the relative short-term credit or part thereof in German currency pursuant to Clause 10 hereof.   
(5).  Every German Bank Debtor or German Commercial or Industrial Debtor shall be obligated to cover at maturity any bill accepted for its account by a Foreign Bank Creditor.   
(6).  Any Foreign Bank Creditor to whom a short-term credit is owing in a currency other than that of his own country may, by giving notice in writing to his German Debtor at any time within the period of this Agreement, convert such credit into the currency of the country of such Foreign Bank Creditor. Such conversion shall thereupon be effected in the books of the Foreign Bank Creditor and the German Debtor, and the amount of the short-term credit expressed in the new currency shall be calculated by reference to the official middle rates for exchange of German currency into the original currency of the credit and such new currency respectively quoted in the Federal Republic on the date of the relative notice.   

### 4  

####Reduction of Indebtedness (Temporarily inoperative)

Each Foreign Bank Creditor shall have the right to require permanent repayment, three months after the date of this Agreement and at the end of each three calendar monthly period thereafter during the period of this Agreement, by ... per cent. of the total amount of the short-term credits owing to such Foreign Bank Creditor by his German Debtors at the date of the coming into force of this Agreement, in respect of which adherence shall be made. Such repayment shall be made in the currency of the country of the Foreign Bank Creditor and the right to repayment of the total of the short-term credits by ... per cent., may be exercised by the Foreign Bank Creditor by applying such aggregate repayment right to the short-term credits owing by one or more of his German Debtors as the Foreign Bank Creditor may elect. The Foreign Bank Creditor shall be entitled to allocate his repayment rights to any particular indebtedness owing by an individual German Debtor. (Note: *Additional provisions may be required for mechanics of payment.)*  

### 5  

####Recommercialisation

(1).  The Bank deutscher Laender shall from time to time announce to the Foreign Band Creditors that a certain percentage (herinafter called the “stated percentage”) of each Foreign Bank Creditor's aggregate short-term credits outstanding on the date of this Agreement may be recommercialised.   
(2).  Thereupon each Foreign Bank Creditor may within three months of such announcement arrange with Banks or other concerns in the Federal Republic (being or capable of becoming German Debtors as defined in this Agreement) for the opening of new credit lines (hereinafter called “substituted lines”) up to the stated percentage of his aggregate short-term credits referred to in the preceding sub-Clause.   
(3).  Upon any such arrangement being concluded the Foreign Bank Creditor shall notify the Bank deutscher Laender that it is proposed to open the relative substituted line upon final repayment of an equal amount of specified short-term credits or parts thereof (hereinafter called “designated indebtedness”) owing by a German Debtor (hereinafter called the “designated Debtor”) and designated by the Foreign Bank Creditor. Except where the substituted line is with a German licensed foreign trade bank (Aussenhandelsbank) the Bank deutscher Laender shall have the right to disapprove the arrangement if it is not satisfied that the new debtor will be able to make adequate use of the substituted line.   
(4).  Unless the Bank deutscher Laender disapproves the arrangement for recommercialisation, pursuant to the preceding sub-Clause, the Foreign Bank Creditor shall give notice to the designated Debtor to repay the designated indebtedness and such Debtor shall, as promptly as possible, arrange through the Bank deutscher Laender for such repayment in foreign currency and upon such repayment the substituted line will be open for availment.   
(5).  A Foreign Bank Creditor who has received security for designated indebtedness shall notify the designated Debtor of his willingness in case of a part repayment to release, against such repayment, a proportionate part of such security except where the security is not capable of division or except where the agreement between the parties otherwise provides. Failing such notification the Foreign Bank Creditor shall not be entitled to demand repayment of such indebtedness.   
(6).  In so far as a Foreign Bank Creditor who has given or participated in giving a credit on joint account as defined in Clause 7 of the German Credit Agreement of, 1931 is entitled (under any still subsisting arrangements governing the rights of the parties to such credit *inter se*) to demand any separate repayment on account of his participation, he shall not be permitted to demand repayment of the indebtedness owing by a German Commercial or Industrial Debtor without at the same time demanding repayment of at least a corresponding proportion of the indebtedness owing by the German Bank Debtor in the joint account provided that such German Bank Debtor has adhered to this Agreement.   
(7).  No syndicate as such may exercise any of the rights of a Foreign Bank Creditor under this Clause. Nothing in this sub-Clause is intended to affect such rights as any participant in a syndicate may have either through withdrawal from such syndicate or by arrangements therewith to make an individual demand for repayment of designated indebtedness under this Clause.   
(8).  Substituted lines shall be available only by bills drawn for financing trade between the Federal Republic and other countries and not merely for the purpose of creating foreign exchange or for the purpose of financing business which could more properly be financed by inland credits; provided that a Foreign Bank Creditor shall not be obliged to accept any bill drawn in respect of a transaction which is for the time being prohibited or disapproved by the authorities of the respective foreign creditor country or which it would not be the current practice of banks in such country to finance by an acceptance credit. If any question shall arise whether any bill complies with the foregoing provisions, such question shall be decided by agreement between the Foreign Bankers' Committee concerned and the German Committee. All such bills outstanding at any time shall be covered by the German Debtor at maturity in cash in the currency of the credit and the unavailment thus created shall be again availed of only in accordance with this sub-Clause. For the cash payment referred to herein a German Debtor may use the proceeds of a new bill; provided that 

(i) the new bill shall have been presented to the Foreign Bank Creditor a week, if possible, and at least four business days before the due date of the maturing bill and shall have been designated for the purpose of meeting the maturing bill from the proceeds;  

(ii) the new bill complies with the requirements of this sub-Clause, and  

(iii) the Foreign Bank Creditor shall have accepted the new bill before the due date of the maturing bill.   If a new bill so offered is not so accepted by the Foreign Bank Creditor on the grounds that it does not comply with the requirements of this sub-Clause the German Debtor shall be bound to remit cash to cover the maturing bill punctually on maturity. The German Debtor in that case may apply to the Foreign Bankers' Committee concerned through the German Committee and if such Committees agree that the new bill does comply with the requirements of this sub-Clause, then the Foreign Bank Creditor shall be bound to accept the new bill.   
(9).  If a Foreign Bank Creditor has failed within three months of the announcement of any stated percentage to take advantage of the whole or part of his rights to arrange recommercialisation, such rights shall lapse (without however affecting such Foreign Bank Creditor's right to other recommercialisation pursuant to subsequent announcements of stated percentages).   
(10).  The Bank deutscher Laender will use its best efforts to arrange that a certain amount of eligible business shall be available for recommercialisation.   
(11).  A Foreign Bank Creditor who has opened a substituted line and the Debtor to whom such line is granted shall be subject to all the provisions of this Agreement in respect of such substituted line and forms of adherence in respect thereof shall be exchanged upon the Foreign Bank Creditor receiving repayment of the relative designated indebtedness.   
(12).  If in the opinion of the Bank deutscher Laender a substituted line is not being adequately availed of in the interests of the German economy, the Bank deutscher Laender may require the Foreign Bank Creditor to place so much of such line as is not then availed of at the disposition of some other bank, banking institution or commercial or industrial firm or company in the Federal Republic (being or capable of becoming a German Debtor) selected by the Foreign Bank Creditor and not disapproved by the Bank deutscher Laender. In such case the original substituted line shall be cancelled *pro tanto* and the new line of equivalent amount shall constitute a new substituted line, and the Foreign Bank Creditor and new German Debtor shall be subject to all the provisions of this Agreement in respect of the new substituted line and forms of adherence in respect thereof shall be exchanged. If the Foreign Bank Creditor shall fail to select a new German Debtor to the satisfaction of the Bank deutscher Laender the latter may propose a new German Debtor; and, if the Foreign Bank Creditor shall refuse to accept such proposed new German Debtor, the reasonableness of such refusal shall at the request of the Bank deutscher Laender be determined by agreement between the German Committee and the relative Foreign Bankers' Committee and, if such Committees are unable to agree, then by the Arbitration Committee.

(a) Where 

(i) A German Bank Debtor holds from any of its clients any security, whether general or specific (including guarantees) as collateral for credit facilities held by the German Bank Debtor at the disposal of such client and  

(ii) the credit facilities granted to such client (whether secured or not) have arisen out of any short-term credit owed to one or more Foreign Bank Creditors by the German Bank Debtor   the whole of such security or a *pro rata* share thereof for the time being held by the German Bank Debtor shall be held by the German Bank Debtor in valid and effectual trust for such Foreign Bank Creditor or Foreign Bank Creditors, upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which it is held by the German Bank Debtor. The existence of such trust shall not interfere with the administration by German Bank Debtors in accordance with ordinary banking practice of any such security from time to time held by them.  

(b) In the event of the security becoming enforceable the proceeds thereof shall be divided amongst the German Bank Debtor and the Foreign Bank Creditors as nearly as possible in accordance with the provisions which would have been applicable to such division under the 1939 Agreement.  

(c) The German Bank Debtors shall continue, whenever it appears to them necessary for the protection of the interests of themselves and the Foreign Bank Creditors, to obtain security from their clients and to maintain it at an appropriate amount.  

(d) Each German Bank Debtor shall furnish his Foreign Bank Creditors with confirmation in writing of the holding of security in trust for them pursuant to the provisions of this sub-Clause and supply to his Foreign Bank Creditors upon general or specific request statements in the standard form agreed upon by the German Committee with the Foreign Bankers' Committees and made up as at the 30th June and the 31st December showing (i) by an estimated percentage figure, the extent to which any short-term credit referred to in paragraph (*a*) of this sub-Clause is secured, (ii) the total amount of the short-term credits owed by the German Bank Debtor to the Foreign Bank Creditor to whom the statement is supplied, (iii) the estimated value of the *pro rata* share of the Foreign Bank Creditor in the security mentioned in (i) above, and (iv) details of the security so held showing the nature thereof and the extent to which security is held for the obligations of any particular clients.     
(2).  In the case of short-term credits for account of German Commercial or Industrial Debtors the German Commercial and Industrial Debtor shall provide collateral security in favour of a Foreign Bank Creditor as follows: 

(a) Where and so far as under the arrangement existing under the latest of the previous Agreements applicable to the relative short-term credit the German Commercial or Industrial Debtor was under obligation to provide security, he shall continue to provide security of the same character and to the same extent during the period of this Agreement.  

(b) Where and so far as the giving of security is consonant with the business of the German Commercial or Industrial Debtor and such security can be given without endangering the position of his other creditors.     
(3).  A German Debtor shall promptly upon demand furnish to any of his foreign Bank Creditors a copy of his last audited Balance Sheet and such other particulars relating to his financial position as the Foreign Bank Creditor may reasonably require.   
(4).  A Foreign Bank Creditor may with the consent of the Bank deutscher Laender realise outside the Federal Republic any security in existence at the date of this Agreement in respect of a short-term credit and apply the net proceeds of such realisation (after payment of all expenses incurred in effecting realisation) in permanent reduction or discharge of the relative short-term credit. Provided that he shall be obligated to secure the best terms and conditions reasonably obtainable in the interest of the German Debtor.   

### 7  

####Switching of Creditors

(a) no such transfer shall (except by agreement with the German Debtor in question) involve any change in the terms attaching to such credit or part of a credit;  

(b) forthwith upon any such transfer being effected the necessary forms of adherence shall be exchanged between the transferee and the German Debtor;  

(c) any such transfer to a Foreign Bank Creditor or other person, firm or corporation as aforesaid in the country of one of the other Foreign Bankers' Committees shall also be subject to the consent of the Bank deutscher Laender.   Upon any such transfer being effected and the necessary forms of adherence being exchanged the transferee shall have the same rights and obligations in respect of the short-term credit or part of a credit so transferred as if he were the original creditor.  

### 8  

####Switching of Debtors

Any Foreign Bank Creditor may at any time during the period of this Agreement with the agreement of the German Debtor (who shall first obtain the consent of the Bank deutscher Laender) make arrangements for the transfer to another banker, banking institution or commercial or industrial firm or company in the Federal Republic (being or capable of becoming a German Debtor) of liability in respect of a short-term credit (not being a substituted line as defined in Clause 5 hereof) owing by any Grerman Debtor. Upon such transfer being effected the Foreign Bank Creditor and the new German Debtor shall be subject to all the provisions of this Agreement in respect of such credit and forms of adherence in respect thereof shall be exchanged.  

### 9  

####Extension of New Credits

(1).  If any Foreign Bank Creditor shall during the continuance of this Agreement make additional foreign exchange facilities available to the German economy by granting to any German bank, banking institution or commercial or industrial firm or company a new credit line (not being a substituted line as defined in Clause 5 hereof) in non-German currency for the purpose of financing trade between the Federal Republic and other countries, every original and subsequent availment of such credit line shall give rise to repayment rights in accordance with this Clause of an amount at the rate of 3 per cent. of such availment for every three months of such availment. Any such new credit line shall not be subject to this Agreement.   
(2).  For the purpose of this Clause the term “availment” shall include the acceptance of a bill, the granting of a cash advance and, in the case of a confirmed credit, the opening of such credit.   
(3).  Such repayment rights may be exercised by the Foreign Bank Creditor by applying the same to such short-term credits or parts thereof owing by any one or more of his German Debtors as the Foreign Bank Creditor may select.   
(4).  Upon any such availment notice may be given by the Foreign Bank Creditor to the German Debtor or Debtors to whose short-term credits or parts thereof he proposes to apply any repayment right as aforesaid and a copy of such notice, together with particulars of the new credit line and the availment thereof, shall simultaneously be forwarded by the Foreign Bank Creditor to the Bank deutscher Laender. Each such German Debtor shall as promptly as possible arrange through the Bank deutscher Laender for final repayment in foreign currency of the relative amount specified in the Creditor's notice.   
(5).  The provisions of sub-Clauses (5), (6) and (7) of Clause 5 hereof shall be deemed to be incorporated *mutatis mutandis* in this Clause.   
(6).  If any German Debtor shall fail to comply with a notice for repayment with reasonable promptitude the Foreign Bank Creditor shall be entitled to apply the relative repayment right or part thereof to some other short-term credits in accordance with the foregoing conditions.   

### 10  

####Repayment in German Currency

(1).  Any German Debtor may arrange at the request of his Foreign Bank Creditor to make repayment of a particular short-term credit or part thereof in German currency, converted as hereinafter provided, to the same extent as such German Debtor might on 24th May, 1952, have voluntarily made such repayment pursuant to Directive (50) 6 of the Allied Bank Commission to the Bank deutscher Laender dated 26th June, 1950.   
(2).  Conversion from foreign currency into German currency shall be calculated at the official middle rate quoted in the Federal Republic one working day previous to the day on which the payment in German currency is actually made.   
(3).  Every such payment shall upon acceptance by the Foreign Bank Creditor constitute final repayment of the foreign currency amount of the short-term credit or part of the short-term credit calculated at the conversion rate provided in sub-Clause (2) of this Clause.   
(4).  Balances in German currency arising from repayment of short-term credits pursuant to this Clause or Clause 11a shall be applicable and transferable as permitted under provisions of any Allied laws, ordinances, directives and licences (including General and Special licences issued by the Bank deutscher Laender) in effect in the Federal Republic on 24th May, 1952, or as otherwise permitted by the Bank deutscher Laender. However, no regulation of the Bank deutscher Laender shall at any time with regard to the transfer and use of German currency balances and affecting Foreign Bank Creditors be more unfavourable in effect to such Creditors, or cause their rights to be more limited, than such rights as existed under the aforesaid laws, ordinances, directives and licences.   

### 11  

####Commission and Interest Charges

As from the date of this Agreement all commission and discounting charges in keeping with usual banking practice, together with bill stamp duty, shall be paid in advance and interest shall be paid monthly in the currency in which the respective credit is maintained. It is desirable that commission and interest charges shall not be more than reasonable under the circumstances and should any difference arise as to the amount thereof between a Foreign Bank Creditor and a German Debtor the matter may be referred to their respective Central Banks.  

### 11A  

####Arrears of Interest

Interest on short-term credits at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum for the period since the date to which such interest was last paid to the Foreign Bank Creditor or the date of termination of the latest of the previous Agreements applicable thereto (whichever be the later) up to the date of this Agreement shall, at the option of the Foreign Bank Creditor concerned, either 

(i) as of the date of this Agreement be added to the principal of the relative short-term credit and form part thereof for the purpose of adherence to and for all other purposes of this Agreement, or  

(ii) be postponed and fall due in the relative foreign currency upon the termination of this Agreement, provided however that at any time prior to such termination the Foreign Bank Creditor may be paid pursuant to the provisions of Clause 10 hereof all or any part of such postponed interest in German currency (converted at the official middle rate quoted in the Federal Republic one working day previous to the day on which payment is actually made).   Each Foreign Bank Creditor, upon giving notice to his German Debtor of adherence to this Agreement, shall at the same time notify such Debtor which of the options the Creditor elects to exercise and, if no election is so notified, the Creditor shall be deemed to have elected to exercise option (i).  

### 12  

####Prorating of Payments and Security by German Banks

(1).  If a German Debtor, who is indebted both to a Foreign Bank Creditor and to a German Bank Debtor, has become insolvent or has sought a composition or other arrangement of a similar character with all or some of his creditors or has been declared bankrupt within the period of this Agreement or within three months thereafter, the German Bank Debtor shall prorate with the Foreign Bank Creditor any repayments received by the German Bank Debtor from the German Debtor at any time within four months before the happening of such event, as well as any security (including guarantees) received from the German Debtor at any time within the period of this Agreement.   
(2).  The Trustee in bankruptcy (Konkursverwalter), any German official in charge of any composition or arrangement as aforesaid and the German Bank Debtor shall furnish all the Foreign Bank Creditors concerned with full information as to any repayments made or security given as aforesaid.   

### 13  

####Retention of the Liability of Guarantors, etc.

(1).  No guarantor, endorser or credit insurer in the Federal Republic in respect of any short-term credit shall obtain any release from obligations under his guarantee, endorsement or insurance by reason of the postponement of or any change in the form of such short-term credit or part thereof (including the change provided for in Clause 19 hereof) by virtue of or consequent upon this Agreement and no debtor in the Federal Republic whether absolutely or contingently liable in respect of any short-term credit shall be released by reason of any partial payment on account thereof by any third party or by reason of any change in the form of such short-term credit or any part thereof by virtue of or consequent upon this Agreement. If the indebtedness of a German Debtor is guaranteed or credit insured by a guarantor or credit insurer outside the Federal Republic who does not assent to the postponement of or change in the form of such indebtedness the German Debtor shall not be entitled to the benefit of this Agreement.   
(2).  If a person being a partner of a firm which is a German Bank Debtor or German Commercial or Industrial Debtor ceases to be a partner during the continuance of this Agreement whether owing to his death or from any other cause any liability arising under any short-term credit maintained under this Agreement shall be deemed to be a liability existing at the date when such person ceased to be a partner; and the personal liability of such person or if he be dead the liability of his estate for liabilities of his firm which were existing at the date when he ceased to be a partner shall apply to any liability arising under any such short-term credit while maintained under this Agreement.   

### 14  

####Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Breach; and Effect of Loss of Benefits of this Agreement by a German Debtor

(1).  If at any time during the period of this Agreement a German Debtor is declared bankrupt or becomes insolvent he shall forthwith cease to enjoy any benefits and privileges under this Agreement. If a Foreign Bank Creditor during the period of this Agreement claims that a German Debtor has become insolvent and this claim is disputed either party shall have the right to refer the dispute for decision to the Arbitration Committee. Pending a decision by the said Arbitration Committee the Foreign Bank Creditor shall refrain from taking any steps against the German Debtor.   
(2).  If at any time during the period of this Agreement a German Debtor applies to the competent tribunal for a composition (Vergleichsverfahren) or other arrangement of a similar character with all or some of his creditors any Foreign Bank Creditor of such Debtor at any time before such composition or other arrangement is confirmed by the competent tribunal may give notice to such Debtor terminating this Agreement as between the parties and upon the giving of such notice the Debtor shall cease to enjoy any benefits and privileges under this Agreement.   
(3).  If at any time during the continuance of this Agreement a Foreign Bank Creditor claims that a German Debtor has committed a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and has failed to remedy such breach upon request within a fortnight of receipt of formal notice from the Foreign Bank Creditor, such Foreign Bank Creditor may refer the dispute to the Arbitration Committee for decision. If such reference shall have been so made no steps shall be taken in the matter by any party to this Agreement pending a decision by the Arbitration Committee. If the Arbitration Committee shall give a decision adverse to the German Debtor and the German Debtor shall fail, within a fortnight of the decision of such Committee, to comply therewith the German Debtor shall forthwith cease to enjoy any benefits or privileges under this Agreement in respect of the short-term credit held at his disposal by the Foreign Bank Creditor.   
(4).  If a German Debtor ceases at any time to enjoy any benefits, or privileges under this Agreement by reason of any of the provisions of the foregoing sub-Clauses of this Clause, then in the case of bankruptcy, insolvency or composition (Vergleichsverfahren) or other arrangement of a similar character with all or some of his creditors his indebtedness to all his Foreign Bank Creditors, and in the case of a breach of his indebtedness to the Foreign Bank Creditor or Creditors affected by such breach, shall forthwith become due and payable and thereupon nothing shall prevent the Foreign Bank Creditor or Creditors concerned from prosecuting and enforcing all his or their claims against the German Debtor including the exercise of such remedies as he or they would have if permanently resident in the Federal Republic.   
(5).  The fact that a German Debtor has lost the benefit of this Agreement shall not prejudice the rights of any party which existed at the date on which such loss of benefit took place and in particular shall not prejudice the rights of his Foreign Bank Creditor against the Deutsche Golddiskontbank in respect of any guarantee of short-term credits in respect of which such Debtor was liable.   
(6).  If a German Debtor shall at any time cease to enjoy any benefits or privileges under this Agreement by reason of notice given pursuant to sub-Clause (2) of this Clause other than in case of a composition (Vergleichsverfahren), then the provisions of Clause 16 hereof shall not be applicable to the obligations of such Debtor in respect of the relative indebtedness.   

### 15  

####Maintenance of Credits for Longer Periods

Any Foreign Bank Creditor may make arrangements with his German Debtor for the maintenance of his short-term credits or some of them for a period longer than is provided by Clause 2 of this Agreement or for the substitution of such credits by other credits to be maintained for a period longer than is provided by that Clause. On the making of any such arrangement the short-term credit or short-term credits which is or are so extended or substituted shall cease to be subject to this Agreement if the Bank deutscher Laender agrees.  

### 16  

####Provision of Foreign Exchange

The Bank deutscher Laender undertakes to make available at all times during the period of this Agreement the necessary foreign exchange to enable the German Debtors to discharge the obligations necessitating the provision of foreign exchange and assumed by them under or pursuant to this Agreement.  

### 17  

####Consultative Committee

(1).  For the purpose of conferring from time to time with the German Committee and the Bank deutscher Laender and keeping the Foreign Bankers' Committees informed of matters arising during the period of this Agreement and of performing such other duties, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, as shall be entrusted to them under this Agreement or by the Foreign Bankers' Committees, a meeting of a Consultative Committee consisting of delegates representing the Foreign Bankers' Committees may be convened at any time by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Representatives of Foreign Bankers' Committees and shall be so convened by him at any time if he is requested so to do by the German Committee or by any Foreign Bankers' Committee. Each Foreign Bankers' Committee signatory to this Agreement shall be entitled to nominate a delegate. Any meeting fixed by or in accordance with this Clause may be cancelled or postponed by notice given by the Chairman of the said Joint Committee.   
(2).  Subject as hereinafter provided all decisions of the delegates shall be taken by the vote of delegates present and representing a majority of the Foreign Bankers' Committees, provided that such majority of Foreign Bankers' Committees shall represent not less than 50 per cent. in face value of the short-term credits then outstanding.   
(3).  The Committee herein appointed may by unanimous vote of the delegates present at a meeting and with the agreement of the German Committee construe and amend the terms of this Agreement from time to time, provided that no amendment shall be made which shall substantially change the rights of the parties or adherents hereto. The determination of the Committee herein appointed and of the German Committee that any such amendment does not substantially change such rights shall be binding on all the parties and adherents hereto.   
(4).  If at any time it becomes possible under laws then in force in the Federal Republic for a Foreign Bank Creditor to require repayment of a short-term credit or any part thereof in German currency, then the Consultative Committee by unanimous vote of its delegates at a meeting (or by written agreement of all such delegates without a formal meeting) may amend Clauses 10 and 11a of this Agreement so as to make payment in German currency thereunder compulsory upon the Debtor if and to the extent that a Foreign Bank Creditor shall require the same subject, however, to any then still subsisting limitations in force in the Federal Republic regarding such payments. Any such amendment shall be binding upon all the parties and adherents hereto.   

### 18  

####Investments under Previous Agreements

As from the date of this Agreement interest and earnings in respect of investments made out of Registered Credit Balances pursuant to Clause 10 of any of the previous Agreements shall be dealt with as provided in clause 10 (5) *(g)* of the 1939 Agreement; provided that the rate at which such interest and earnings will be transferred shall not exceed the rate of interest for the time being payable on short-term credits to Foreign Bank Creditors in the same creditor country.  

### 19  

####Maturity of Credits

All indebtedness arising under short-term credits covered by this Agreement shall mature on the expiration or termination hereof and such indebtedness shall thereupon become due and payable. Furthermore, on such expiration or termination, Foreign Bank Creditors shall be entitled to debit the accounts of German Debtors with the amount of all bills accepted for account of such German Debtors notwithstanding the fact that the bills themselves are drawn for later maturity but so that no interest shall be chargeable until the bills mature. In the case of confirmed credits, Foreign Bank Creditors shall be entitled to debit as an actual liability the amount of all bills drawn thereunder prior to the expiration of this Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that such bills have not at that date been presented for acceptance and, as a contingent liability, the unused balance of any confirmed credit, but so that interest shall not be chargeable until the bills mature or until cash has actually been advanced by Foreign Bank Creditors in respect of such credits.  

### 20  

####Arbitration

(1).  In case any dispute shall occur between Foreign Bank Creditors and German Debtors or the Bank deutscher Laender as to the interpretation of this Agreement or as to any matter or thing arising thereout, the same shall be referred to an Arbitration Committee constituted in accordance with the provisions of this Clause. <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup>   
(2).  The Arbitration Committee shall be constituted as follows: 

(a) The Bank for international Settlements shall nominate three persons to serve as permanent members of the Arbitration Committee, designating one of such persons as Chairman of the Committee an a second person as Vice-Chairman to preside over any meeting of the Committee in the absence of the Chairman.  

(b) In addition the Bank for International Settlements shall nominate three persons who shall be available to serve as alternate members of the Arbitration Committee in place of any one or more of the permanent members who may from time to time be unable through illness or otherwise to attend meetings of the Committee, specifying the permanent member which each such alternate is to replace. No alternate shall be entitled to attend any meeting of the Committee except in the absence of and as substitute for his respective permanent member.     
(3).  The Rules of the Arbitration Committee shall provide *inter alia* that: 

(a) Not less than ten days' notice shall be given to each of the signatories to this Agreement (that is to say, the Foreign Bankers' Committees, the German Committee and the Bank deutscher Laender) of the hearing of any questions referred to the Arbitration Committee by any of such signatories and thereupon each of such signatories shall have the rights of a party to the proceedings as provided in the next succeeding paragraph of this sub-Clause.  

(b) In respect of every question referred to the Arbitration Committee all parties to the proceedings shall be entitled to be represented at the hearing thereof by a representative, lawyer or other agent and to submit for consideration of the Arbitration Committee a written statement of arguments in support of or in opposition to such question in accordance with such regulations as to procedure as the Arbitration Committee may from time to time prescribe.  

(c) The Arbitration Committee shall decide from time to time the times and places at which the sessions of the Committee are to take place and shall give due notice thereof to all signatories to this Agreement.  

(d) The Arbitration Committee shall in respect of every decision made by it, whether or not such decision is unanimous, state briefly in writing the grounds upon which such decision is based provided, however, that the grounds for the Committee's decision need not be given if the Committee so determines by a unanimous vote, unless one of the parties has prior to the hearing requested in writing that the grounds be stated. In cases where no grounds are stated the award shall contain a record of the fact that a unanimous decision to that effect was passed by the Committee and that no request was made by any of the parties as aforesaid.  

(e) If the Arbitration Committee shall, in respect of any question referred to it, declare itself not to be competent to decide the same and if upon application to the appropriate court of law in the country of any of the parties to the proceedings, jurisdiction shall be declined upon the ground that jurisdiction rests with the Committee, or, if the question be referred back wholly or in part to the Committee, then in either such case the Committee shall decide the question.     

### 21  

####Expenses

The costs and expenses of and incidental to the preparation and execution of this Agreement and of carrying the terms thereof into effect, including all legal costs and other expenses properly incurred by Foreign Bankers' Committees prior to the execution of this Agreement (but not earlier than 1st November, 1950) and during the continuance thereof, shall be for the account of the German Debtors. Provision for the payment of all such costs, expenses and remuneration shall be made by the German Committee.  

### 22  

####Adherence

(1).  Adherence to this Agreement shall be effected by each Foreign Bank Creditor notifying to his German Debtor or Debtors within two months from the coming into force of this Agreement his willingness to adhere, by means of a letter in standard form rendered in duplicate (specifying the short-term credits in respect of which such German Debtor or Debtors are liable and in respect of which adherence is made) which will be obtainable from the Foreign Bankers' Committees in the respective foreign creditor countries. Every German Debtor shall forward within four days of receipt of a letter of adherence from any of his Foreign Bank Creditors a letter confirming his adherence in standard form which will be obtainable from the Bank deutscher Laender or any Landeszentralbank . Adherence by the Foreign Bank Creditor may be effected by cable subsequently confirmed in the foregoing manner. <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup> <sup> (1)  See Sub-Annex.  </sup>   
(2).  Each Foreign Bank Creditor who formerly participated in a syndicate credit shall be entitled to adhere to this Agreement in respect of his participation in the business.   
(3).  Upon adherence having been effected the Foreign Bank Creditor and the German Debtor shall become parties to this Agreement in respect of the short-term credits so specified, and shall thenceforth be entitled to the rights granted to and be subject to the obligations to be assumed by the Foreign Bank Creditors and German Debtors respectively under this Agreement.   
(4).  Any Foreign Bankers' Committee may, with the consent of the German Committee, extend the time within which any one or more Foreign Bank Creditors in its country may adhere to this Agreement. Provided that where any person, firm or company in the Federal Republic becomes liable in respect of a short-term credit or part thereof by way of succession or substituted succession during the period of this Agreement or where new adherences are exchanged pursuant to Clause 5, 7 or 8 hereof, adherence in respect of such credit or part of a credit may be made without such consent as aforesaid within a reasonable time after such succession or other relevant event takes place.   
(5).  In the case of any short-term credit or part thereof which has been granted to a bank debtor who is not ordinarily resident inside the Federal Republic or whom his Foreign Bank Creditor can no longer locate or identify and in respect of which a client of such bank debtor ordinarily resident inside the Federal Republic is also liable, such client shall be bound (if the Foreign Bank Creditor so requires) to adhere to this Agreement in respect of such credit or part of a credit to which the provisions of this Agreement shall then apply as if the same had originally been granted direct to the client.   
(6).  In the case of any short-term credit or part thereof which has been granted to a commercial or industrial debtor who is not ordinarily resident inside the Federal Republic or whom his Foreign Bank Creditor can no longer locate or identify and in respect of which some person ordinarily resident inside the Federal Republic is also liable as guarantor, endorser or credit insurer, such person shall be bound (if the Foreign Bank Creditor so requires) to adhere to this Agreement in respect of such credit or part of a credit to which the provisions of this Agreement shall then apply as if the same had originally been granted direct to such person.   
(7).  Where a German banking, commercial or industrial concern becomes or has become the successor to the primary liability under any short-term credit or part thereof pursuant to or as a result of German law (*e.g.,* Reg. 35 under monetary Law No. 63 or Credit Institution Law promulgated March 29, 1952) the Foreign Bank Creditor may adhere to this Agreement *vis-à-vis* such concern in respect of such credit or part of a credit and such concern shall confirm adherence on its part in the manner and with the effects provided in this Agreement. This provision shall also be operative in the case of any substituted succession in respect of a short-term credit or part thereof where such substitution is in accordance with laws now in force in the Federal Republic (*e.g.,* Art 7 (3) of Credit Institution Law promulgated March 29, 1952). Upon adherence by any successor German Debtor in respect of a short-term credit or part thereof the relative adherence by any predecessor German Debtor shall (except as herein otherwise provided) cease to have force and effect.   
(8).  Where pursuant to laws now in force in the Federal Republic *(e.g.,* Reg. 35 under Monetary Law No. 63 or Credit Institution Law promulgated March 29, 1952) one or more successor banking institutions become or have become jointly liable with the original German Bank Debtor in respect of a short-term credit or part thereof, then (subject to the provisions of the two succeeding sub-Clauses) such successor institution or institutions shall also adhere to this Agreement in respect of such credit or part of a credit, but in such case the adherence of the original German Bank Debtor shall continue in full force and effect.   
(9).  In the case of any short-term credit or part thereof which has been granted to a German Bank Debtor and in respect of which a client of such German Bank Debtor ordinarily resident outside the Federal Republic is also liable, neither the German Bank Debtor nor any banking institution jointly liable with it shall be obliged to take any action in respect of such credit or part of a credit under the provisions of this Agreement (except to adhere by way of acknowledgment of the existence and amount of such credit or part of a credit) unless and until the Foreign Bank Creditor would be entitled in the absence of this Agreement to enforce payment in the Federal Republic of the relative indebtedness under German law.   
(10).  In the case of any short-term credit derived from an original cash advance which was not converted into an acceptance credit, payment of which the Foreign Bank Creditor (by reason of laws for the time being in force in the Federal Republic, *e.g.,* Reg. 35 under Monetary Law No. 63 or Art. 7 (2) of the Credit Institution Law promulgated March 29, 1952) can enforce within the Federal Republic only to the extent of a proportionate part, the German Bank Debtor and any banking institution which may be jointly liable with it shall not be obliged to take any action under the provisions of this Agreement in respect of that proportionate part which the Foreign Bank Creditor cannot for the time being enforce (except to adhere by way of acknowledgment of the existence and amount thereof) until the Foreign Bank Creditor would be entitled in the absence of this Agreement to enforce payment in the Federal Republic of the relative indebtedness under German law.   

### 23  

####Deutsche Golddiskontbank

(1).  Nothing contained herein shall limit the obligations of, or the rights of any Foreign Bank Creditor against the Deutsche Golddiskontbank as the same are set forth or incorporated in the latest of the previous Agreements applicable to a particular short-term credit and Clause 23 of the 1939 Agreement is incorporated herein by reference (to be effective as from the date of this Agreement) except that as regards the text of such Clause: 

(a) sub-Clause (3) thereof shall be deemed to be amended so that the words “this Agreement” in sub-Clause (5) (*b*) of Clause 23 of the 1933 Agreement shall be substituted by the words “any of the previous Agreements”.  

(b) sub-Clause (4) thereof shall be deemed to be amended so that the words “Clause 23 of the 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938 Agreements” shall be substituted by the words “Clause 23 of any of the previous Agreements”.  

(c) sub-Clauses (5) and (7) thereof shall be deleted.     
(2).  The Liquidator of the Deutsche Golddiskontbank by signing this Agreement accepts the provisions of sub-Clause (1) of this Clause and severally acknowledges to each Foreign Bank Creditor holding any short-term credit or part of a short-term credit payment of which has heretofore been guaranteed by the Deutsche Golddiskontbank and in respect of which adherence is made to this Agreement that, to the extent that such credit or part of a credit has not heretofore been paid or satisfied, the liability upon such guarantee remains in full force and effect.   

### 24  

####Payments from Other Sources

In the event that subsequent to his adherence to this Agreement any Foreign Bank Creditor shall in relation to any existing indebtedness owed by a debtor in the territory comprised in the German State on the 31st day of December, 1937, accept payment of any sum of money from a source other than such debtor, which sum he is required by operation of law or otherwise or elects to apply against short-term credits covered by this Agreement, then such Foreign Bank Creditor shall apply such moneys in permanent repayment of indebtedness in respect of the short-term credit or credits (if any) in relation to which such sum was received; provided that if such sum was not received in relation to any particular short-term credit or credits then, unless the Foreign Bank Creditor has other indebtedness of the nature aforesaid (not being short-term credits) owing to him against which he can legally apply and elects to apply such moneys, the same shall be applied by the Foreign Bank Creditor against such short-term credit or credits as he may select. Promptly upon application of such moneys in reduction of any short-term credit or credits the Foreign Bank Creditor shall notify the relative debtor or debtors and the German Committee and his own Foreign Bankers' Committee of such application and the indebtedness in respect of the short-term credit or credits against which such moneys are so applied shall thereafter be permanently repaid accordingly.  

### 25  

####Execution and Short Title

The original parts of this Agreement executed by the German Committee, the Bank deutscher Laender and the respective Foreign Bankers' Committee shall be forwarded through the respective Central Banks to the Bank for International Settlements for retention by that institution in safe custody for all parties interested therein.

To The American Committee for Standstill Creditors of Germany. The British Banking Committee for German Affairs. The Swiss Banking Committee for the German Credit Agreement.  *19th February, 1953.*  Dear Sirs,  *The German Credit Agreement of 1952*  We refer to the statements which have been made by the Tripartite Commission on German Debts on behalf of the Governments represented thereon and by the German Delegation on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that their Governments are prepared by appropriate administrative action in Germany to permit the German Credit Agreement of 1952 (contained in Annex III to the Agreement on German External Debts and below referred to as “the 1952 Agreement”) to come into force on ratification of the Agreement on German External Debts by the Federal Republic of Germany, except that foreign currency payments provided for in the 1952 Agreement, other than those normally arising pursuant to Clause 5 thereof, shall be postponed until the Agreement on German External Debts (below referred to as the “Intergovernmental Agreement”) comes into force in accordance with Article 35 thereof. We also refer to the forms of Adherence proposed to be exchanged conditionally between creditors and debtors under the 1952 Agreement in which reference is made *(inter alia)* to the postponement of foreign currency payments under that Agreement as mentioned above and the debtors agree that upon the 1952 Agreement becoming fully effective pursuant to the said Intergovernmental Agreement, they will make prompt payment to the creditors of all foreign currency payments under the 1952 Agreement which shall in the meantime have been postponed. We hereby agree that the 1952 Agreement shall come into force upon compliance with the provisions of Clause 29 thereof and upon ratification of the said Intergovernmental Agreement by the Federal Republic of Germany, but shall cease to become effective if it is not included in the said Intergovernmental Agreement when the latter Agreement comes into force. Accordingly Clause 2 of the 1952 Agreement shall be read as if the date when compliance shall have been made with Clause 29 of that Agreement and when ratification of the Intergovernmental Agreement shall have been made by the Federal Republic of Germany were inserted therein as the date upon which the provisions of the 1952 Agreement shall come into force. We further agree that, if the 1952 Agreement is included in the said Intergovernmental Agreement when the latter Agreement comes into force in accordance with Article 35 thereof, we will do all such things as are within our respective powers to enable prompt payment to be made to the creditors of all foreign currency payments under the 1952 Agreement which shall in the meantime have been postponed. We confirm that, by agreement between the parties to the 1952 Agreement, the following amendments are to be made to the text of that Agreement as contained in Appendix 5 to the Final Report of the Conference on German External Debts and are to be incorporated in the Agreement in the form in which it is signed, viz: *Paragraph (7) of Preamble.* The words “Government of the Federal Republic or other appropriate authority” to be substituted by the words “appropriate governmental authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany and the Western Sectors of Berlin.” The word “and” to be inserted at the end of sub-paragraph (ii) and the same word to be deleted at the end of sub-paragraph (iii). Sub-paragraph (iv) to be preceded by the words “and shall ensure as far as possible that”. *Clause 1: Definitions.* The words “and relates to the identification of territory and not to governmental jurisdiction” to be added at the end of the definition of “Federal Republic”. *Clause 20: Arbitration.* In sub-Clause (1) the words “who have adhered to this Agreement” to be inserted after the words “German Debtors”. *Clause 22: Adherence.* In sub-Clause (1) the words “confirming his adherence” to be deleted and the words “confirming his adherence to this Agreement and (if the creditor so requests) agreeing that he will adhere to any renewal or extension thereof that may be signed by the German Committee and the Bank deutscher Länder” to be inserted at the end of the second sentence of that sub-Clause. We, the undersigned German Committee, hereby consent, in accordance with Clause 22 (4) of the 1952 Agreement, to your Committee's extending the time within which any one or more foreign bank creditors in your respective countries may adhere to the 1952 Agreement to enable such adherence to be made at any time within two months of the said Intergovernmental Agreement coming into force. Yours faithfully, (signed) For and on behalf of the German Committee for Standstill Debts. (signed) For and on behalf of the Bank deutscher Länder. To: The German Committee for Standstill Debts. The Bank deutscher Länder.  *20th February, 1953.*  Dear Sirs, 
### *The German Credit Agreement of 1952* 

We acknowledge receipt of your letter with regard to the arrangements for the bringing into force of the above Agreement and the temporary postponement of payment to the creditors of foreign currency payments provided for in that Agreement, other than those normally arising pursuant to Clause 5 thereof, and hereby confirm our acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in your letter. In particular we agree 

(a) that the 1952 Agreement shall come into force upon compliance with the provisions of Clause 29 thereof and upon ratification of the Agreement on German External Debts (below referred to as the “Intergovernmental Agreement”) by the Federal Republic of Germany but shall cease to become effective if it is not included in the said Intergovernmental Agreement when the latter Agreement comes into force;

This letter may be executed in several counterparts which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. Yours faithfully, (signed) For and on behalf of the American Committee for Standstill Creditors of Germany.

####Exceptions

Excluded from this settlement proposal are, until otherwise stipulated, claims against the City of Berlin and against public utilities located in the area of and controlled by Berlin.  

### Section  B  

####General Principles

### Article  6  

####Conversion into Deutsche Mark

(1).  Claims expressed in Reichsmark shall be settled after the foreign creditor has declared his agreement to his claim being converted into Deutsche Mark at the same rate as would apply in the case of a similar claim of a domestic creditor. This applies also to such monetary claims expressed in Goldmark or Reichsmark with a gold clause as have no specific foreign character within the meaning of the following paragraph (2). The German Foreign Exchange Control Authorities shall continue to issue any licence necessary for a conversion pursuant to the Conversion Law or for a modification of the conversion rate pursuant to the legislation on Deutsche Mark balance sheets, to the extent that the creditor is entitled to such conversion or modification.   
(2).  The principle is accepted that such monetary claims arising from financial transactions and mortgages, expressed in Goldmark or in Reichsmark with a gold clause as had a specific foreign character, shall be converted into Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 Goldmark, or 1 Reichsmark with a gold clause, = 1 Deutsche Mark. The definition of the criteria constituting the specific foreign character of such claims shall be the subject of further negotiation . The contracting parties reserve their position as to the question in which cases and in which way the above principle can be implemented. It shall lie with the German Delegation to decide how the solution arrived at can be fitted into the framework of the German laws on currency reform and on the equalisation of war and post-war burdens. <sup> (1)  See now Annex VII.  </sup> The above-mentioned negotiations between a German Delegation and the creditors' representatives should take place not later than 31st October, 1952.   

### Article  7  

####Claims expressed in Foreign Currency with Gold Clauses

For the purpose of the settlement of these claims the following principles shall apply *mutatis mutandis:* In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs, the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollar equalling 1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 gold Swiss franc, and the new contracts shall be expressed in currency dollars or currency Swiss francs respectively. In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding German currency debts with gold clauses - see Article 6, paragraph 2) the amounts due shall be payable only in the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or the issue was made (referred to below as “the currency of issue”), the amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rate of exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in U.S. dollars which shall be arrived at by converting the amount of the obligation expressed in the currency of issue into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange ruling when the loan was raised or the issue made. The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be less than if it were computed at the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952.  

### Article  8  

####Computation in Deutsche Mark of Claims expressed in Foreign Currency

Claims expressed in foreign currency shall be computed in Deutsche Mark based on the parity of the day preceding the date of repayment, as notified to the International Monetary Fund. Where no parity is laid down, the computation shall be made according to the mean rate of exchange quoted by the Bank deutscher Länder on the day preceding the date of payment.  

### Article  9  

####Konversionskasse for German External Debts

I.  The German Delegation was of the opinion that the German debtor was definitively discharged of his debt to the extent of his payments into the Konversionskasse. The creditor representatives, on the other hand, were of the opinion that as a rule such payments into the Konversionskasse would not be recognised as discharging the German debtors under the laws of their respective countries. In their desire to put an end to fruitless legal discussions, both sides agreed to seek a practical solution which would permit settlement of the claims of the creditors without unnecessary formalities. Accordingly the German Delegation and the foreign creditor representatives, while reserving their respective legal positions, have agreed as follows: 

(1) The German debtor undertakes to settle the creditor's claim in accordance with the new settlement terms, regardless of the payments made to the Konversionskasse, to the extent that the creditor 

(a) has not in fact received from the Konversionskasse the payment corresponding to that made by the debtor to it, or  

(b) refused to accept a payment or performance from the Konversionskasse based on a payment made by the debtor, on the ground that he (the creditor) was unwilling to recognise such payment or performance as discharging the debt.   In the case of securities subject to the validation law for German Foreign Currency Bonds, the arrangement set out above shall apply only to such Bonds and Coupons as shall have been validated pursuant to the provisions of such law and of any agreement entered into with the country of issue respecting the application of such law, or with respect to the declaratory decrees (Feststellungsbescheide) which the creditor shall have received pursuant to the said law.  

(2) The amounts so paid by the debtors shall be reimbursed to them out of German public funds.  

(3) Payments made by the debtor into the Konversionskasse which do not fall within the provision of sub-paragraph (1) shall be considered as discharging the debt to the extent of such payments.     
II.  Subject to the general provisions contained in paragraph I above: 

(a) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for full payment in the due currencies to the foreign creditors of the sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in the Saar in respect of which the foreign creditors have not received foreign exchange payments or been otherwise satisfied;  

(b) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for payment in the respective foreign currencies to the foreign creditors of 60 per cent. of the sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in Austria, France, Belgium and Luxemburg in respect of which the foreign creditors have not received foreign exchange payments or been otherwise satisfied;  

(c) the Federal Government will negotiate with the foreign creditors' representatives before the end of December 1952 as regards the implementation of these undertakings.     

### Article  10  

####Payments into the Deutsche Verrechnungskasse

The negotiating parties have discussed the payments made by German debtors to the Deutsche Verrechnungskasse which were not paid out to the creditors In view of the variations in the terms of the contracts between Germany and other countries, which are not yet executed, the creditors and debtors are of the opinion that the questions which have not been clarified should be solved by Governmental negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the States concerned.  

### Article  11  

####Hardship Clause

Where and in so far as the financial position of a debtor has been affected by war or the repercussions of war or other extraordinary conditions, to such an extent that the debtor cannot be expected to settle his obligations in accordance with the conditions and within the time-limits laid down in this settlement proposal, he should be granted relief. This shall be equitable and take into account the debtor's special circumstances. The relief shall be in accordance with the concessions which the debtor has been or may be granted by a German creditor on similar grounds under German Law, especially under the legislation for the Relief of Debtors (Vertragshilferecht). Where the creditor and debtor do not reach agreement, the competent German Court shall make a decision. The creditor shall have the option of appealing against the decision of the Lower Court under the provisions of German Law, or, within a period of 30 days after notice of the Court decision has been served, of appealing to the Court of Arbitration constituted according to the provisions of Article 17. The decision of the Court of Arbitration shall be binding.  

### Article  12  

####Succession to Claims and Debts by Operation of Law

(1).  Where a foreign creditor has acquired or shall hereafter acquire claims of another foreign creditor by legal succession on death, the claim shall be treated within the framework of this settlement proposal in the same manner as if the original creditor continued to be entitled to it. The same shall apply to similar cases of succession by operation of law.   
(2).  Any person who, by law or by a binding order, is under an obligation to take over the debt, or who has taken it over by contract, shall be liable for the debt as the successor of the debtor.   

### Article  13  

####Change of Creditor

(1).  The creditor may assign to some other foreigner the total amount of his claim for which he may demand payment to a foreign country, provided that the assignment 

(a) is made to a resident within the same currency area,  

(b) does not entail any modification of the terms underlying the claim,  

(c) does not result indirectly or directly in settlement of a claim.   The competent German authorities will give permission for the assignment if the conditions laid down in *(a)* to *(c)* are fulfilled. Over and above this, they shall give favourable consideration to wellfounded applications by a foreign creditor for approval of an assignment of part of his claim. By the acquisition of the claim the new creditor shall have the same rights and obligations as the original creditor. Should the new creditor demand from the debtor settlement of the claim in Deutsche Mark, the regulations for “original blocked accounts” shall apply to his blocked account after a period of three months has elapsed since the change of creditors occurred.   
(2).  As far as the assignment of claims is concerned for which the creditor can demand payment only in Deutsche Mark, the regulations concerning the use and assignment of such claims in force at the time in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West) shall be decisive (see Article 19).   

### Article  14  

####Participation of Creditors and Debtors in the Debt Settlement, Foreign Currency Regulations, Debtor Obligations

(1).  Creditors and debtors desiring to settle a claim and obligation under the terms of this settlement proposal, must exchange written declarations to this effect. The creditor's declaration of participation may also be made through an agency established in the creditor country for the transmission of such declarations.   
(2).  The valid Exchange Control Regulations in Germany and abroad, taking into consideration the special facilities and assurances specified in this settlement proposal, shall apply to the relations between the creditor and debtor.   
(3).  Where the debtor refuses to make a declaration but the creditor declares himself bound to his own declaration of participation in relation to the debtor, the German Foreign Exchange Authorities shall at the request of the creditor issue to him within the limits of his declaration of participation any necessary foreign exchange licences. Such foreign exchange licences shall enable the creditor to sue for and recover his claims against the debtor to the extent and in the manner provided in this settlement proposal for such claims. In so far as the creditor has not obtained satisfaction by judicial execution, he may evoke his declaration of participation. The issue of the foreign exchange licence shall not constitute a decision on the existence and amount of the claim.   
(4).  Should the creditor require payment in Deutsche Mark, he shall be obliged to make a written declaration to the debtor that he accepts such payment in settlement of his claim.   
(5).  Where the creditor is entitled to require, and requires, payment in a foreign country, the debtor shall be obliged to take all the steps necessary under valid German Foreign Exchange Control Regulations to procure the necessary instruments of payment in foreign currency.   

### Article  15  

####Settlement of Disputes

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this settlement proposal, any disputes between creditor and debtor as to the existence and the amount of any claims shall be decided by a Court of Law, or a Court of Arbitration agreed upon by the parties, which is competent in view of the legal relationship between the parties.  

### Article  16  

####Mixed Commission

A Mixed Commission, which shall be composed of an equal number of representatives of the creditor countries, on the one hand, and of the Federal Government, on the other hand, as well as of one Chairman, shall be set up to decide differences as to the interpretation of this settlement. It is recommended that the Commission shall be competent to decide questions of fundamental importance for the interpretation of this settlement which are submitted to it by the Governments concerned. Where a Government is of the opinion that a case, which is pending in the Court of Arbitration (Article 17), is of fundamental importance, it is recommended that the Government may require the Court of Arbitration to refer the case to the Mixed Commission. The Court of Arbitration should have the same right.  

### Article  17  

####Court of Arbitration

The Court of Arbitration referred to in Article 11 shall be composed of one arbitrator appointed by each of the parties. The two arbitrators shall elect a chairman. Should they not be able to agree on the person, they shall request the President of the International Chamber of Commerce to appoint him. The arbitrators shall possess the qualifications required for holding judicial office in their respective countries; this shall not apply to the Chairman. The Court of Arbitration shall decide upon its own procedure. It shall also decide which party shall bear the costs. The German Delegation will advise the Federal Government to make provision that in cases where the parties are unable to make an advance of vosts or bear the costs as fixed, the payment of such costs shall be adequately settled. On the joint application of the parties, the Court of Arbitration may also decide in other disputes between creditors and debtors. Detailed provisions relative to the Court of Arbitration proposed in this Article shall be agreed upon in the Governmental discussions for the implementation of the recommendations of the Conference on German External Debts.  

### Article  18  

####Payment in Deutsche Mark

Payment in Deutsche Mark according to this settlement shall be understood as meaning payment in German currency into an account held by a foreign creditor or opened in his name at his request with a financial institution in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany or Berlin (West). The account shall be subject to the German Foreign Exchange Control Regulations from time to time in force. This shall not exclude the issue of special licences for other forms of payment.  

### Article  19  

####Utilisation of Blocked Deutsche Mark Accounts

(1).  The foreign creditor of an “original credit account” in German currency shall be permitted to utilise it within the framework of the legal provisions in force in the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West) at the time this settlement comes into effect, including the right to assign such credits to another person outside Germany.   
(2).  The foreign creditor of an “acquired credit account” in German currency shall continue to be permitted to assign his credit to another person outside Germany. The foreign creditor of such account shall continue to be permitted to utilise his credit mainly for long-term investments in the German economy.   
(3).  The competent German authorities shall draw up the regulations necessary to prevent the illegal disposal of credits in German currency and to preclude any other abuses detrimental to the German economy and to the creditors as a whole. Utilisations permitted by a general licence at the time this settlement comes into force may, in order to ensure proper control, be made dependent upon the issue of a separate licence without thereby restricting the general possibilities of utilisation.   
(4).  The competent German authorities will endeavour to provide facilities for the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts to such an extent as the foreign exchange situation shall permit. They will aim at simplifying the licence procedure as much as possible.   
(5).  The Federal Government shall set up an Advisory Committee composed of an equal number of representatives of the main creditor countries, on the one hand, and of representatives of the Federal Republic, on the other hand, for the discussion of general matters in connection with the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts.

####Concessions in Favour of Debtors

The creditors are of the opinion that the concessions granted under the terms of this settlement should accrue to the benefit of the debtors.  

### Article  23  

####Effective Conversion

(1).  A change in the terms of the debt relationship between creditor and debtor shall be considered as an effective conversion, if it was made before 9th June, 1933, or if it occurred on or after 9th June, 1933, as a result of free negotiation or on account of the insolvency or threatened insolvency of the debtor.   
(2).  It shall be presumed that there is no effective conversion resulting from free negotiation if at the time of conversion the creditor was represented by the German Custodian of Enemy Property or by a similar person appointed by the German authorities without his consent.   
(3).  In the case of bonded claims, a conversion shall likewise not be considered an effective conversion if the creditor has merely accepted a unilateral offer made by the debtor.   
(4).  The burden shall be on the debtor to prove that the conversion was an effective conversion.   
(5).  In the case of Church loans, any conversion shall be considered effective.   

### Article  24  

####Currency of Payment

Provisions as to the currency in which monetary claims shall be discharged are reserved to intergovernmental arrangements.  

### Article  25  

####Validation Laws for German Bonds

This settlement shall not apply to bonds and interest coupons which require to be validated under the German Validation Law for Bonds of 19th August, 1949 (Wirtschaftsgesetzbl., page 295) and the Validation Law for German External Bonds of August, 1952, until these bonds and interest coupons have been validated pursuant to the provisions of such laws or any agreement which may be concluded with the country of issue with regard to such laws.

It shall lie with the competent German authorities to give favourable consideration to the possibility of an early payment to a foreign country in cases of hardship.

### Article  32  

####Joint Provisions for Old Commercial Debts (Article 1, (1) to (9))

(a) where the annual interest rate has heretofore been 4 per cent. or less, the interest rate shall remain the same as before;  

(b) where the annual interest rate has heretofore been more than 4 per cent., this shall be reduced to 2/3 but not less than 4 per cent. per annum.   The reduced amount of interest arrears shall be added to the principal.   
(2).   *Future Interest*  No interest shall be due for the period from 1st January, 1953, to 31st December 1957. Where interest was due for the period up to 1st January, 1953, the amount of the claims for the time being outstanding on or after 1st January, 1958, shall bear interest. The rate of interest shall represent 75 per cent. of the due rate. The new rate of interest shall, however, be not less than 4 per cent. nor more than 6 per cent. per annum. Where heretofore a rate of interest of 4 per cent. per annum or less was due, this rate shall remain. The interest shall be paid at the end of each year in non-German currency together with the amortisation amount.   
(3).   *Special Deposit*  

(a) As far as claims of groups in Article 1, (1) to (7), are concerned the creditor may, instead of specifying payment in accordance with Article 26, 27, 28 or 31, require the debtor to effect payment into a Deutsche Mark Deposit Account maintained in his name with an agency to be designated by the competent German authorities, if his claim is proved to be jeopardised. Should the debtor in respect of such a request invoke the hardship clause (see Article 11), the demand of the creditor for a deposit shall take effect only when the invocation of the hardship clause by the debtor has been finally rejected.  

(b) The debtor may pay the amount of a debt covered by the categories specified by paragraph *(a)* into such a deposit in favour of the creditor, provided he can furnish proof that 

(aa) he (the debtor) is the heir or executor of the original debtor and the estate is due to be apportioned;  

(bb) he (the debtor) is a company going into liquidation;  

(cc) the receiver or the composition administrator of the debtor is paying out dividends on bankruptcy or composition settlements.    

(c) Payment into a deposit account in accordance with the abovementioned provisions shall discharge the debtor from his debt. In this case, the creditor shall, in respect of payment to a foreign country, be accorded the same treatment as if the amount on deposit (including interest, if the deposit agency pays interest) were in the hands of the debtor.  

(d) The creditor shall have the right, at any time, to demand transfer of an amount paid into a special deposit account to his Deutsche Mark account (Article 18).     
(4).   *Small Claims*  In cases of claims for small amounts, the competent German authorities shall give favourable consideration to applications of interested parties for approval of an early payment to a foreign country.   
(5).   *Payments for Supplies of Goods and Services where the Creditor can furnish proof that the payment into his account was effected without his consent*  A creditor who furnishes proof that a payment in respect of goods and services to his bank account or Postscheckkonto (Article 1) was effected without his consent shall, by payment into such an account, not forgo his right of having the payment dealt with under Section C.   

### Section  D  

####Settlement of Claims arising out of Private Financial Transactions (Article 2)

### Article  33  

Claims in German currency arising out of financial transactions, including such claims as are expressed in Goldmark or Reichsmark with a gold clause and are not of a specific foreign character (Article 6), may continue to be discharged under the agreed contractual interest and amortisation terms, pursuant to the foreign exchange regulations in force at the time of payment in the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West). According to the regulations at present valid, payment may be made only in Deutsche Mark.  

### Article  34  

Claims expressed in a foreign currency, arising out of financial transactions, and those expressed in Goldmark or Reichsmark with a gold clause but which are of a specific foreign character (Article 6) shall be settled as follows: 

(1) Where the debtor has effected payments to the „Konversionskasse für deutsche Auslandsschulden,” the amounts of unpaid principal and interest shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 9.  

(2) Where interest is owing, the following interest rates without allowing for compound interest shall be applicable for the computation of the arrears of interest owing up to 31st December, 1952: 

(a) where the annual interest rate has heretofore been 4 per cent. or less, the interest rate shall remain the same as before;  

(b) where the annual interest rate has heretofore been more than 4 per cent., this shall be reduced to 2/3 but not to less than 4 per cent. per annum.    

(3) The amount of arrears of interest computed in accordance with paras. (1) and (2) shall be added to the undischarged claim. The resulting new principal shall bear interest as from 1st January, 1953, at a rate which shall represent 75 per cent. of the interest rate in force at the time this settlement comes into effect. The new interest rate shall, however, be 

(a) in the case of bonded claims, at least 4 per cent. and at the most 5¼ per cent. per annum,  

(b) in the case of other claims, at least 4 per cent. and at the most 6 per cent. per annum.   Where an interest rate of 4 per cent. or less has been owed heretofore, this rate shall remain the same. The interest shall be payable to a foreign country at least semi-annually.  

(4) In the case of any claims which have been the subject of an effective conversion that rate of interest agreed upon in the effective conversion shall form the basis for the computation of any reduction pursuant to paras. (2) and (3). Interest reductions on which there is a time-limit shall be taken into consideration only for the period for which they were arranged.  

(5) In the case of any claims which have been the object of a non-effective conversion, that rate of interest which would have been valid without this conversion shall form the basis for the computation of any reductions pursuant to paras. (2) and (3).  

(6) The new principal shall be discharged as from 1st January, 1958, by payment to a foreign country as follows: 

(a) during the first five years (1st January, 1958, to 31st December, 1962) at 3 per cent. per annum;  

(b) during the next five years (1st January, 1963, to 31st December, 1967) at 8 per cent. per annum;  

(c) during the subsequent three years (1st January, 1968, to 31st December, 1970) at 15 per cent. per annum.   Interest shall be computed on the principal outstanding from time to time.  

(7) The creditor may demand up to 30th June, 1953, that arrears of interest computed in accordance with paras. (2) and (4) shall not be added to the principal according to para. (3) but shall be discharged by payment in Deutsche Mark. The debtor shall effect payment within six months after such request.  

(8) Where small amounts are involved, the parties concerned may, in special cases, agree upon different terms of repayment with the approval of the competent German authorities.  

(9) Creditors and debtors may, in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Regulations in force in the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin (West), agree upon payment of the claim or part thereof in Deutsche Mark.  

(10) The competent German authorities reserve, in cases of hardship, the right of giving favourable consideration to applications by the parties concerned for the approval of different terms of repayment.  

(11) Foreign creditors of claims listed in Article 2, para. (2) *(b),* may ask for payment in Deutsche Mark of the interest due up to 31st December, 1952, without the reduction proposed in paragraph (2) of this Article, provided they accept such payment as discharge of their claim.  

(12) If necessary, the principles laid down in Annex II to the Agreement on German External Debts may be adopted to supplement these rules for the settlement of claims arising out of bonds and interest coupons covered by this settlement proposal.

### *Joint Statement by the German and Swiss Delegations concerning the Negotiations on the Settlement of the Swiss Franc Land Charges. (Schweizer Frankengrundschulden)* 

Discussions were held at Freiburg i.B. on 10th-11th June, 1952, in implementation of the statement made on 20th March, 1952, by the creditor and debtor representatives - for the attention of the London Debt Conference. These negotiations could not, however, be brought to a conclusion. The London Conference was informed of this by a statement on 11th June, 1952. Owing to various circumstances it has so far proved impossible to continue the negotiations. The parties will, however, resume the discussions, in consultation with the “Vertrauensstelle”, at the earliest possible date. The German Delegation will inform the London Conference of their results in good time before the signing of the general Governmental Agreement on the settlement of German External Debts. The Swiss side refers again to the exposé on the Swiss Franc land charges which was submitted to the Conference subsequent to the statements made by the Swiss Delegation in the Second Plenary Meeting on 29th February, 1952, and distributed under Ref. No. GD/V/Negotiating Committee D/Doc. 3 of 13th March, 1952. The Swiss side reserves the right, therefore, of making a further statement, dependent upon the results of the bilateral negotiations. On the other hand, the German side is of the opinion that the Swiss Franc land charges fall under the terms of reference of the London Conference for the Settlement of German External Debts and that they are to be settled in accordance with the principles laid down by Negotiating Committee D. Both sides agree that a Court of Arbitration, which is to be set up within the scope of the settlement of the debts dealt with in Negotiating Committee D, shall not be competent to deal with the Swiss Franc land charges but that the cases arising shall be submitted to the “Vertrauensstelle” set up pursuant to the German-Swiss Agreements.  *London, 25th July, 1952.*  (sd) PAUL LEVERKUEHN.

### ANNEX  V  

####Agreed Recommendations for the Treatment of Payments made to the Konversionskasse

[Note: *The text reproduced hereunder is the text of Appendix 7 to the Report of the Conference on German External Debts.* ] 

I. The German Delegation was of the opinion that the German debtor was definitively discharged of his debt to the extent of his payments into the Konversionskasse. The creditor representatives, on the other hand, were of the opinion that as a rule such payment into the Konversionskasse would not be recognised as discharging the German debtors under the laws of their respective countries. In their desire to put an end to fruitless legal discussions, both sides agreed to seek a practical solution which would permit settlement of the claims of the creditors without unnecessary formalities. Accordingly, the German Delegation and the foreign creditor representatives while reserving their respective legal positions, have agreed as follows: 

(1) The German debtor undertakes to settle the creditor's claim in accordance with the new settlement terms, regardless of the payments made to the Konversionskasse, to the extent that the creditor 

(a) has not in fact received from the Konversionskasse the payment corresponding to that made by the debtor to it, or  

(b) refused to accept a payment or performance from the Konversionskasse based on a payment made by the debtor, on the ground that he (the debtor) was unwilling to recognise such payment or performance as discharging the debt.   In the case of securities subject to the validation law for German Foreign Currency Bonds, the arrangement set out above shall apply only to such Bonds and Coupons as shall have been validated pursuant to the provisions of such law and of any agreement entered into with the country of issue respecting the application of such law, or with respect to the declaratory decrees (Feststellungsbescheide) which the creditor shall receive pursuant to the said law.  

(2) The amounts so paid by the debtors shall be reimbursed to them out of German public funds.  

(3) Payments made by the debtor into the Konversionskasse which do not fall within the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) shall be considered as discharging the debt to the extent of such payments.    

II. Subject to the general provisions contained in paragraph I above: 

(a) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for full payment in the due currencies to the foreign creditors of the sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in the Saar, in respect of which the foreign creditors have not received foreign exchange payments or been otherwise satisfied;  

(b) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for payment in the due currencies to the foreign creditors of 60 per cent, of the sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in Austria, France, Belgium and Luxemburg in respect of which the foreign creditors satisfied; and  

(c) the Federal Government will negotiate with the foreign creditors' representatives before the end of December 1952 as regards the implementation of these undertakings.       

### ANNEX  VI  

[Note: *The text reproduced hereunder is the text of Appendix 8 to the Report of the Conference on German External Debts.* ]  *Agreed Recommendations for the Utilisation of Blocked Deutsche Mark Accounts*  The following detailed arrangements have been agreed upon for the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts: 

(1) The foreign creditor of an “original credit account” in German currency shall be permitted to utilise it within the framework of the regulations in force in the German Federal Republic and Berlin (West) at the date on which this settlement comes into effect, including the right to assign such accounts to another person outside Germany.  

(2) The foreign creditor of an “acquired credit account” in German currency shall continue to be permitted to assign his account to another person outside Germany. The foreign creditor of such account shall continue to be permitted to utilise his account mainly for long-term investments in the German economy.  

(3) The competent German authorities shall draw up and issue the regulations necessary to prevent the illegal disposal of accounts in German currency and to preclude any other abuses detrimental to the German economy and to the creditors as a whole. Utilisations permitted by a general licence at the time this settlement comes into force may, in order to ensure proper control, be made dependent upon the issue of a special licence without thereby restricting the general possibilities of utilisation.  

(4) The competent German authorities will endeavour to provide facilities for the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts to such an extent as the foreign exchange situation shall permit. They will aim at simplifying the licence procedure as much as possible.  

(5) The German Government shall set up an Advisory Committee composed of an equal number of representatives of the main creditor countries, on the one hand, and of representatives of the German Federal Republic, on the other, for the discussion of general matters in connection with the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts.     

### ANNEX  VII  

####Agreement on Goldmark Liabilities and Reichsmark Liabilities with a Gold Clause, having a specific foreign character

German Delegation for External Debts. 243-18 Del. 39-2177/52. To the Chairman of the Tripartite Commission on German Debts, 29 Chesham Place, London, S.W. 1.  *London, S.W. 1,*   *21st November, 1952.*  Mr. Chairman, The negotiations provided for in Article V, paragraph 3, of Appendix 4 and in Article 6 of Appendix 6 to the Final Report of the London Debt Conference and referred to in the joint letter from Sir Otto Niemeyer and Herr Hermann J. Abs to the Tripartite Commission on German Debts, the purpose of which was to define the criteria constituting the specific foreign character of Goldmark liabilities and of Reichsmark liabilities with a gold clause or a gold option, took place in London from 21st October to 21st November, 1952, between the German Delegation for External Debts and a delegation of British, American, Swiss and Netherlands creditor representatives. We are glad to be able to inform you that these negotiations resulted on 21st November, 1952, in an understanding which was recorded in an Agreement signed to-day. The Chairman of the two Delegations, in signing this Agreement, exchanged four letters dated 21st November, 1952, designed to clarify various questions in connexion with the Agreement, as follows: 

1. Exchange of letters concerning the transfer of amounts due for payment on Goldmark claims with a specific foreign character.  

2. Exchange of letters concerning the interpretation of the provision on a “trusteeship contract”.  

3. Exchange of letters concerning a question of interpretation in connexion with the 40th Executory Ordinance to the Currency Conversion Law.  

4. Exchange of letters concerning a reservation by the creditors with respect to the conversion of claims against secondary debtors and the possibility of the withdrawal of this reservation.   We have the honour to submit to you one copy of the text of the Agreement in the German and English languages and of the four exchanges of letters, also in the German and English languages, with the request that you should approve them as soon as possible. We should be grateful if the Agreement and also the four exchanges of letters could be appended as sub-Annexes to Annexes I, II and IV of the Debt Agreement. Please accept, Mr. Chairman, the expression of our highest esteem. (sd) HERMANN J. ABS. Head of the German Delegation for External Debts. (sd) N. LEGGETT. Chairman of Negotiating Committee B at the Conference on German External Debts. Note: 

1.  *It was agreed by the signatories to the above letter that these documents should become Annex VII to the Agreement on German External Debts and not sub-Annexes to Annexes I, II and IV of that Agreement, as requested in the final paragraph above.*   

2.  *The exchange of letters referred to in the final paragraph above have now been summarised and are attached as the Sub-Annex to Annex VII.*    
###Agreement on Goldmark Liabilities and Reichsmark Liabilities with a Gold Clause, having a specific foreign character

*London, 21st November, 1952.*  By virtue of the reservations made in Article V, paragraph 3, of Appendix 4, and in Article 6 of Appendix 6 of the Final Report of the London Debt Conference, and of the joint letter adressed by the Head of the German Delegation, Herr Hermann J. Abs, and Sir Otto Niemeyer to the Tripartite Commission on German Debts, dated 19th November, 1952, on the subject of Goldmark loans of German municipalities, it is agreed as follows: 

I. In respect of the claims and rights specified below it is recognised that they have a specific foreign character within the meaning of the above-mentioned provisions. 

1. Claims expressed in Goldmarks or in Reichsmarks with a gold clause or a gold option arising out of bonds made out by German debtors and issued or placed abroad, if 

(a) they constitue a loan, the conditions of which show that is was intended for investment, sale or negotiation in foreign countries only. Where the interest on any bond has been exempt from taxation of capital yield, the bond shall be considered as forming part of a loan which was intended for investment sale or negotiation in foreign countries only;  

(b) they are payable in foreign countries only under the terms of the bonds.   Any part of a loan which differs from the other parts of the loan in respect of special designation or special treatment in Germany as regards taxation or quotation shall likewise be considered as a loan within the meaning of *(a)* or *(b)* above, except where the bonds belonging to such part of a loan were officially quoted on a German Stock Exchange before 1st September, 1939.  

2. Claims expressed in Goldmarks or in Reichmarks with a gold clause or a gold option, arising from other loans or advances resulting from financial transactions and raised abroad by German debtors, including claims of this kind secured by mortgage charges; if 

(a) is was expressly agreed under the original written debt arrangements that the place of payment or the competent court is situated abroad or foreign law is applicable; and if  

(b) whenever the debt was incurred after 31st July, 1931, the equivalent was made available in foreign currency, free Reichsmarks or gold, or originates in a blocked Reichsmark account to which repayments on a Goldmark or foreign currency loan from a foreign country granted before 31st July, 1931, had been credited provided that the foreign creditor has again loaned out the amounts withdrawn from the blocked Reichsmark account, with the consent of the competent German Foreign Exchange Control Authorities, to some other German debtor, stipulating a gold clause or gold option Clause for such renewed loan.   A loan or advance shall likewise be deemed to have been raised in a foreign country if the debtor was aware, when the indebtedness was incurred, that the German creditor, by virtue of a trusteeship contract, was merely the trustee of a foreign lender. A loan or advance raised from the foreign trustee of a German lender shall not be deemed to have been raised in a foreign country.    

II. The claims and rights mentioned under I do not include claims of foreign credit institutions and insurance enterprises which under German Law are required to prepare a conversion sheet, provided the claims have to figure as assets on the conversion sheet.    <sup> (1)  The text of this paragraph was agreed between the parties concerned on 12th February, 1953.  </sup> 

III In the case of real estate liens (mortgages, land charges and terminable annuities), which on 20th June, 1948, had been entered for the purpose of securing the personal claims of a foreign creditor specified in such agreement, the original conversion shall, subject to the provisions set out hereinafter, continue to apply as carried out in accordance with the Conversion Law, including the 40th Executory Ordinance issued thereto. In those cases where any such real estate lien has, in accordance, with these prescriptions, been converted at a rate other than 1:1, the security in favour of the creditor in the form of real estate lien of the same nominal amount as the real estate lien in his favour on the 20th June, 1948, less any subsequent reductions thereof, will be re-established in equal rank in so far as this is possible without interference with any real property rights which a third party may have acquired during the period between the 21st June, 1948, and 15th July, 1952. To the extent that third parties may have acquired such rights during the said period, the following rules shall apply, it being agreed that they will in detail be established by German legislation: 

(a) Where the real property has changed ownership, the security in favour of the creditor, in the form of a real estate lien, which is lacking will be re-established only to the extent that a public charge in respect of the levy on mortgage profits (Hypothekengewinnabgabe) is or will be reduced.  

(b) Where a third party has acquired some other real estate right in the property, the security in favour of the creditor, in the form of a real estate lien, which is lacking will be re-established only in the next best rank. Where, however, a public charge in respect of the levy on mortage profits (Hypothekengewinnabgabe) is reduced, the re-established security will rank before the rights of such third party in so far as and to the extent that the third party benefits from the reduction.  

(c) A creditor who has a claim of a specific foreign character shall be given a lien on such compensation claim as is to be awarded to the debtor to the extent that such creditor's real estate security cannot be re-established in its original rank or cannot be re-established for the full amount for which the claim was secured.  

(d) In cases where the creditor cannot be given a real estate lien corresponding in amount with the former real estate lien, the debtor shall, out of public funds, be enabled to meet the claim in so far as and to the extent that it cannot be satisfied out of security owing to the impossibility of the re-establishment of the former security.   It is agreed that in respect of Berlin (West) an analogous arrangement adapted to the special characteristics of local legislation will apply without the creditors' existing rights or those provided under the terms set forth above being thereby reduced.  

IV. In every case it will be a prerequisite for the specific foreign character that the claims on 1st January, 1945, were held by a person who at that time was a national of a creditor country or, without possessing German nationality, was resident in a creditor country. In cases where a claim or a real estate lien securing a claim was at that date held by a trustee, the criterion shall not be the person of the trustee but the person of the grantor of the trust. A juridical person shall be deemed to be a national of the country under the laws of which it was established.  

V. The Creditor representatives asked that the claims, including real estate liens, of foreign creditors against secondary debtors [as defined in Article 15, paragraph (8), of the Conversion Law as newly worded by AHC Law No. 46 (Official Gazette 1951, No. 46, page 756) - without restriction, however, to United Nations nationals -], in such cases where they are expressed in Goldmarks or Reichsmarks with a gold clause or gold option, shall be regarded as having a specific foreign character and be converted at the rate of 1 Goldmark, or 1 Reichsmark with gold clause, = 1 Deutsche Mark. To this the German Delegation replied that these claims and real estate liens should be considered from the point of view of the security which the German primary debtor would have to propose in the offer to be made under the London Debt Settlement. It was agreed that this matter should be held over pending the clarification of the question of security for the individual primary debtors' obligations. The Creditor representatives, however, reserved the right to demand final settlement of the conversion at the rate of 1 Deutsche Mark = 1 Goldmark or Reichsmark with a gold clause or gold option, of the secondary debtors' obligations in the event that the security offered by the German primary debtor in any particular case should not be sufficient.

####SUB-ANNEX TO ANNEX VII

### *Agreed provisions designed to clarify various questions in connection with Annex VII* 

The Chairman, The Tripartite Commission on German Debts, 29, Chesham Place, London, S.W. 1.  *London, 9th February, 1953.*  Mr. Chairman, We refer to our letter of the 21st November, 1952, to which we attached four exchanges of letters designed to clarify various questions in connection with the Agreement of the 21st November, 1952, on Goldmark liabilities and Reichsmark liabilities with a Gold Clause, having a specific foreign character. It was suggested that for the sake of simplicity these four exchanges of letters might be embodied in one document, to be annexed to the above-mentioned Agreement of the 21st November, 1952. The text of such an Annex has now been agreed on between us, and we have the honour to submit it to your herewith, in English and German, and to request that it may be appended as an Annex to the Agreement referred to. Please accept, Mr. Chairman, the expression of our highest esteem. (sd) HERMANN J. ABS. Head of the German Delegation for External Debts. (sd) N. J. F. LEGGETT. Chairman of Negotiating Committee B at the Conference on German External Debts. 
###Annex to Agreement of 21st November, 1952, on Goldmark liabilities and Reichsmark liabilities with a Gold Clause, having a specific foreign character

The following provisions shall constitute an Annex to the Agreement dated 21st November, 1952: 

1. Is is confirmed that the transfer of amounts due in respect of claims expressed in Goldmarks or in Reichsmarks with a Gold Clause or Gold Option, under Appendices 3 and 4 of the Report of the Conference on German External Debts, shall be treated as if they were payable in a non-German currency in a foreign country in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 1 *(a)* of the draft Intergovernmental Agreement on German External Debts.  

2. It is agreed that the existence of a “trusteeship contract”, as referred to in the last paragraph of Article I 2 of the Agreement of 21st November, 1952, may be proved not only by a document of contract or letters referring to the trusteeship but also by the treatment of the foreign lender as a creditor which was extended to him over the years by the competent German foreign exchange control authorities.  

3. It is agreed that, in the case of mortgages *(i.e.,* all Grundpfandrechte) securing claims expressed in non-German currency which are converted at the rate of 1 Deutschemark = 1 Reichsmark or Reichsmark with a Gold Clause or Gold Option in accordance with Article I, paragraph 2, Clauses 1, 2 and 5 of the 40th Executory Ordinance to the Currency Conversion Law, that conversion is final; this affords the reason why such case is not included in the Agreement of 21st November, 1952.  

4. Under Article V of the Agreement of 21st November, 1952, the creditors have reserved the right, in the case of their claims (including real estate liens) against secondary debtors, to demand final settlement of the conversion at the rate of 1 Deutschemark = 1 Goldmark or 1 Reichsmark with a Gold Clause or Gold Option, in the event that in the offer made by any particular German primary debtor for settlement of his liability the security offered is not deemed by the creditor to be sufficient. In this connexion the head of the German Delegation for External Debts, Mr. Hermann J. Abs, will seek to influence the respective primary debtors to make without delay to their foreign creditors offers of settlement which if accepted will leave the creditors in a position in no way inferior to their present position as provided in the 40th Executory Ordinance to the Currency Conversion Law. If such offers are made and accepted it is contemplated that the creditors will withdraw the reservation made by them in Article V as regards the conversion of their claims against the secondary debtors. Although the above-mentioned reservation strictly relates only to creditors whose cases are covered by the 40th Executory Ordinance to the Currency Conversion Law and Article 15 of that Law (as amended by Law 46), *i.e.,* United Nations Nationals, it is agreed that, according to the principle of non-discrimination and equal tteatment of all creditors, such reservation shall also apply to claims against secondary debtors of creditors who are not United Nations Nationals.     

### ANNEX  VIII  

####Agreed interpretation concerning paragraph (2) of Article 5 of the Agreement on German External Debts

Nothing in paragraph (2) of Article 5 of the Agreement on German External Debts shall be construed as effecting any rights under existing legislation in the Federal Republic of Germany, or which are provided for in any agreement which has been signed, prior to the signature of the Agreement on German External Debts, between the Federal Republic of Germany and any of the other Parties to the last mentioned Agreement.

### APPENDIX  A  

####Exchange of letters embodying the Agreement of 6th March, 1951, between the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany

###A. *Letter to the Allied High Commission from the German Federal Chancellor*

*Bonn, 6th March, 1951.*  Mr. High Commissioner, In reply to your letter of 23rd October, 1950 - AGSEC (50) 2339 - I have the honour to inform you as follows: 
###I

The federal Republic hereby confirms that it is liable for the pre-war external debt of the German Reich, including those debts of other corporate bodies subsequently to be declared liabilities of the Reich, as well as for interest and other charges on securities of the Government of Austria to the extent; that such interest and charges became due after 12th March, 1938, and before 8th May, 1945. The Federal Government understands that in the determination of the manner in which and the extent to which the Federal Republic will fulfil this liability account will be taken of the general situation of the Federal Republic, including, in particular, the effects of the limitations on its territorial jurisdiction and its capacity to pay. 
###II

The Federal Goverment acknowledges hereby in principle the debt arising from the economic assistance furnished to Germany since 8th May, 1945, to the extent to which liability for such debt has not previously been acknowledged in the Agreement on Economic Cooperation concluded on 15th December, 1949, between the Federal Republic and the United States of America, or for which the Federal Republic has not already taken over responsibility under Article 133 of the Basic Law. The Federal Government is ready to accord the obligations arising from the economic assistance priority over all other foreign claims against Germany or German nationals. The Federal Government regards it as appropriate to regulate any questions connected with the recognition and settlement of these debts by bilateral agreements with the Governments of the countries which have rendered economic assistance patterned on the Agreement concluded with the United States of America on 15th December, 1949. The Federal Government takes for granted that these agreements will contain an arbitration clause for cases of dispute. The Federal Government is prepared at once to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of such agreements with the Governments concerned. 
###III

The Federal Government hereby expresses its desire to resume payments on the German external debt. It understands that there is agreement between it and the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the United States of America on the following: It is in the interest of the re-establishment of normal economic relations between the Federal Republic and other countries to work out as soon as possible a settlement plan which will govern the settlement of public and private claims against Germany and German nationals. Interested Governments, including the Federal Republic, creditors and debtors, shall participate in working out this plan. The settlement plan shall in particular deal with those claims, the settlement of which would achieve the objective of normalising the economic and financial relations of the Federal Republic with other countries. It will take into account the general economic position of the Federal Republic, notably the increase of its burdens and the reduction in its economic wealth. The general effect of this plan shall neither dislocate the German economy through undesirable effects on the internal financial situation nor unduly drain existing or potential German foreign-exchange resources. It shall also not add appreciably to the financial burden of any occupation Power. The Governments concerned may obtain expert opinions on all questions arising out of the negotiations on the settlement plan and on the capacity to pay. The result of the negotiations shall be set forth in agreements. It is agreed that the plan will be provisional in nature and subject to revision as soon as Germany is reunited and a final peace settlement becomes possible. I beg your Excellency to accept the assurance of my highest esteem. (sd) ADENAUER. 
###B. *Reply to the German Federal Chancellor from the Allied High Commissioners on behalf of the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America*

*6th March, 1951.*  Mr. Chancellor, In reply to your letter of 6th March, 1951, on the subject of German indebtedness we have the honour, on behalf of the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, to acknowledge the undertakings of the Federal Government in regard to the responsibility of the Federal Republic for the pre-war external debts of the German Reich and for the debt arising out of the economic assistance furnished to Germany by the three Governments since 8th May, 1945. With regard to the priority accorded to the obligations arising from the post-war economic assistance, we are authorised to state that the three Governments would not propose to exercise this priority in such a way as to restrict settlement of foreign-held claims arising out of trade subsequent to 8th May, 1945, essential to the economic recovery of the Federal Republic. With regard to the question of an arbitration clause in agreements covering the debts for post-war economic assistance, the three Governments will be prepared, when negotiating such agreements, to consider whether it would be useful to include an arbitration clause to deal with any matters which might be appropriately settled by such a procedure. We further have the honour on behalf of the three Governments to confirm the understandings of the Federal Government as set forth in the second paragraph of Article I and in Article III of your Excellency's letter. They are now engaged in preparing proposals for the working out of settlement arrangements: these will provide for the participation of foreign creditors, German debtors, and interested Governments, including the Federal Government. The proposals will be designed to arrive at an orderly overall settlement of pre-war claims against Germany and German debtors and of the debt arising out of the post-war economic assistance, which would be fair and equitable to all the interests affected, including those of the Federal Government. It is the intention that the resulting settlement should be embodied in a multilateral agreement; any bilateral agreements that may be considered to be necessary would be concluded within the framework of the settlement plan. As soon as their proposals are ready the three Governments will communicate them to the Federal Government and to other interested Governments and will discuss with them these proposals and the procedure to be adopted for dealing with the subject. We have the honour to state that our three Governments regard your Excellency's letter under reference and this letter as placing on record an agreement between the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, on the one hand, and the Government of the Federal Republic on the other, concerning the questions of German indebtedness covered in these letters. These letters are prepared in English, French and German, each text being equally authentic. Accept, Mr. Chancellor, the renewed assurances of our highest esteem. (sd) A. FRANÇOIS-PONCET. For the Government of the French Republic. (sd) IVONE KIRKPATRICK. For the Government of the United Kingdom. (sd) JOHN J. McCLOY. For the Government of the United States of America.   

### APPENDIX  B  

####Report of the Conference on German External Debts

(Without the Appendices thereto)  

### *London, February - August 1952* 

### *I. Introduction* 

1. The International Conference on German External Debts was called by the Governments of the Republic of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America in order to work out a general agreement for the settlement of German external debts. The Conference presents to the Governments of the participating countries this Report describing its work and setting forth its recommendations relating to the settlement of these debts. The Conference suggests that copies of the Report should be made available to other interested Governments.  

2. Prior to calling the Conference, the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany concluded, on 6th March, 1951, an agreement in which the latter confirmed its liability for the pre-war external debts of the German Reich, acknowledged in principle its debts for post-war economic assistance furnished to Germany by the three Governments, and declared its willingness to resume payments on the German external debts in accordance with a plan to be worked out by all interested parties. A copy of the exchange of letters embodying this agreement is contained in Appendix 1.  

3. In May 1951 the three Governments set up the Tripartite Commission on German Debts to represent them in the negotiations relating to the settlement of German external debts and to organise the work of the Conference. The three Governments were represented on the Tripartite Commission by M. François-Didier Gregh (France), Sir George Rendel (United Kingdom), and Ambassador Warren Lee Pierson (United States); their alternates were M. René Sergent (France), who was later replaced by M. A. Rodocanachi and M. H. Davost, Sir David Waley (United Kingdom) and Minister J. W. Gunter (United States).  

4. The Commission held preliminary discussions in June and July 1951 with the German Delegation on External Debts, appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, and with representatives from some of the principal creditor countries. The German Delegation was headed by Herr Hermann J. Abs, with alternate Dr. W. Kriege.  

5 In December 1951 the Tripartite Commission informed the German Delegation of the amounts and terms of payment which the three Governments were prepared to accept in full settlement of their claims in respect of post-war economic assistance, on condition that a satisfactory and equitable settlement of Germany's pre-war debts were achieved. During the Conference the United States of America further offered to defer collection of the principal of its claim for a period of five years and amended its offer of December 1951 accordingly. The amounts and terms are outlined in Appendix 2 of this Report. <sup> (1)  Appendix 2 of the Conference Report has been superseded by the provisions of the Agreements for the settlement of the claims of the three Governments arising from the post-war economic assistance to Germany, signed on the same day as the Agreement on German External Debts. The last paragraph of the preamble of the latter Agreement makes reference to these Agreements.  </sup>   
### *II. Organisation of the Conference* 

6. The Conference held its first plenary meeting at Lancaster House, London, on 28th February, 1952. The Governments of France, The United Kingdom and the United States of America were represented by the Tripartite Commission on German Debts; the private creditors of these three countries were represented by separate delegations; 22 creditor countries sent national delegations composed of governmental and, in many cases, private creditor representatives; 3 countries sent observers; the Bank for International Settlements was represented as a creditor in its own right; the Delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany included governmental representatives and representatives of private debtors.  

7. In accordance with the decisions of the Conference, there were set up: 

(a) The Steering Committee, composed of the three members of the Tripartite Commission, 13 representatives of creditor interests from Belgium, Brazil, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and 5 members representing public and private debtor interests. Its duty was to organise the work of the Conference and to ensure that alle recommendations submitted to plenary meetings were such as to achieve an equitable overall settlement and equal treatment for all creditors within each category.  

(b) The Creditors' Committee, in which each of the delegations of creditor countries was represented. Its duty was to co-ordinate the views of the various groups of creditor interests, to appoint creditor representatives to negotiating committees and to convey to the Steering Committee the creditors' views with respect to any recommendations resulting from negotiating committees.  

(c) The Conference Secretariat under a Secretary-General. The Secretary-General was first Mr. H. A. Cridland and later Mr. E. H. Peck.    

8. The Steering Committee established four negotiating Committees to deal, respectively, with the following categories of debts:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Committee A.  | Reich debts and other debts of public authorities;  |
| Committee B.  | Other medium and long-term debts;  |
| Committee C.  | Other medium and long-term debts;  |
| Committee D.  | Commercial and miscellaneous debts.  |

Each Committee was composed of representatives of the creditors and debtors, together with observers from the Tripartite Commission. A number of sub-committees was set up by the Negotiating Committees to deal with specific types of debts.  

9. The Steering Committee also established a Statistical Committee to assist the Conference.  

10. The Conference was in session between 28th February and 8th August, 1952, with a recess from 5th April to 19th May, to enable necessary consultations to take place.   
### *III. Framework* 

11. In carrying out its work the Conference has been guided by the following facts, principles and objectives: 

(a) The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America have given the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany assurances with regard to the scaling down and the terms of settlement of the post-war claims for economic aid extended to Germany, which would be accepted by the three Governments on condition that a satisfactory and equitable settlement of pre-war debts were achieved;  

(b) The Settlement Plan should 

(i) take into account the general economic position of the Federal Republic and the effects of the limitations on its territorial jurisdiction; it should neither dislocate the German economy through undesirable effects on the internal financial situation, nor unduly drain existing or potential German foreign exchange resources, and it should not add appreciably to the financial burden of any of the three Governments;  

(ii) provide for an orderly overall settlement and assure fair and equitable treatment of all the interests affected;  

(iii) provide for appropriate action on the reunification of Germany.    

(c) The Settlement Plan should promote the re-establishment of normal financial and commercial relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries. To this end it should 

(i) eliminate the state of default of Germany by suitable treatment of matured and maturing debts and of arrears of interest;  

(ii) lead to a situation which would permit a return to normal debtor-creditor relationships;  

(iii) be of such a character as to contribute to the recovery of Germany's international credit by the restoration of confidence in her financial standing and reliability as a borrower, while giving a reasonable assurance that Germany will not again default on her undertakings;  

(iv) be compatible with and as far as possible facilitate the Federal Republic's eventual compliance with obligations which members of the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation have assumed with regard to the transfer of payments for current transactions, including interest and earnings on investments.       
### *IV. Recommendations* 

12. *Reich Debts and other Debts of Public Authorities.* The recommendations for the settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 3.  

13. *Other Medium and Long-Term Debts.* The recommendations for the settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 4.  

14. *Standstill Debts.* The recommendations for the settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 5. The Conference is in agreement that these recommendations should be put into effect at the earliest date possible.  

15. *Commercial and Miscellaneous Debts.* The recommendations for the settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 6.  

16. The Conference considered several debt problems the special nature of which made their complete and definitive settlement during the Conference impossible. Plans were laid for their subsequent solution in negotiations between the interests involved. Appropriate provisions in this regard have been included in the respective appendices of this Report. Such negotiations should be guided by the principles and objectives of the Conference and the resulting recommendations, if approved, should be covered by the Intergovernmental Agreement.  

17. The terms proposed for the settlement of German debts covered by the Settlement Plan have been worked out in intensive negotiations between representatives of the creditors and the debtors. They conform as closely as possible to the existing contracts.  

18. As will be seen from Appendices 3-6, no repayment in foreign exchange of the principal of any debt covered by the recommendations should be made during an initial period of five years, except in special cases where the recommended settlement terms contain provisions which justify some repayment of principal in the initial period.  

19. Appropriate provision is made in the Appendices for cases of hardship. If a debtor who has several external loans outstanding is unable to meet his obligations under the Settlement Plan, any negotiations between debtor and creditors should be so conducted as to give equal protection to the interests of the respective creditors.  

20. The settlement of debts owed by the City of Berlin or by public utility enterprises owned or controlled be the City of Berlin and located therein is deferred for the time being. Private debtors residing in the Western Sectors of Berlin, however, should be treated like residents of the Federal Republic.  

21. The Intergovernmental Agreement mentioned in paragraph 38 should provide that the Federal Government will resume the transfer of interest and amortisation instalments in accordance with the Settlement Plan, and will do everything in its power to ensure such transfer. The Conference recognised the principle that the transfer of payments under the Settlement Plan implies the development and maintenance of a balance of payments situation in which those payments, like other payments for current transactions, can be financed by foreign exchange receipts from visible and invisible transactions so that more than a temporary drawing on monetary reserves is avoided. In this connection due consideration should be given to the fact that the convertibility of currencies has not yet been re-established. The Conference therefore recognised that the development and maintenance of this balance of payments situation would be facilitated by the continuance of international co-operation to promote liberal trade policies, the expansion of world trade and the revival of the free convertibility of currencies. It recommends that due account should be taken by all concerned of the principles referred to in this paragraph. In preparing the Intergovernmental Agreement consideration should be given to working out provisions designed to ensure that the Settlement Plan is operated and fulfilled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned including provisions to apply in case the Federal Republic, in spite of its utmost efforts, is faced with difficulties in carrying out its obligations under the Plan.  

22. Transfers of interest and amortisation payments due under the Settlement Plan should be treated as payments for current transactions and, where appropriate, included in any arrangements relating to trade and/or payments between the Federal Republic and any of the creditor countries, regardless of whether such agreements are of a bilateral or multilateral nature.  

23. No discrimination or preferential treatment in the fulfilment of the terms agreed on as among categories of debts or currencies in which payable, or in any other respects, should be permitted by the Federal Republic or sought by the creditor countries.  

24. The Government of the Federal Republic should enact the legislative measures and take the administrative action necessary to implement the Plan, such as measures to give the foreign creditor the right to enforce his claim in German courts.  

25. The basis of the settlements foreseen in this report is an offer made or to be made by the debtor to the creditor. Such offer, even if recommended by the creditor representatives, or resulting from arbitration, unless it is specifically agreed that arbitration is binding on individual creditors, may be refused by the creditor, in which case the benefit of the Settlement Plan cannot be claimed by him. The Government of the Federal Republic shall be entitled to take account of this position in giving effect to the provisions of paragraph 24.  

26. The Intergovernmental Agreement should state that, in the case of an accepted offer whenever, under the Settlement Plan, the original debt relationship between the creditor and the debtor is modified, or a new contract concluded between the creditor and the debtor, the latter shall, upon the complete fulfilment of the obligations thereby constituted, be deemed to have discharged fully and finally both his obligations under the modified or new debt relationship and those under the original one.  

27. Prescription on claims covered by the present Settlement Plan should not run during the period in which the sums due under the original contract ceased to be available to the creditors until the date when the sums due are available under the present Settlement Plan. In addition prescription should not be invoked against the rights of foreign holders of internal German securities (including promissory notes and bills of exchange) until at least one year after transfer in foreign exchange of interest or dividends on these securities is available. The Federal Government should take any necessary measures to secure the observance of this principle.  

28. Some loan contracts contain a currency option, *i.e.,* at the option of the creditor, payment may be required in some currency other than the currency of the country in which the loan was issued. Some other contracts may contain similar provisions. This matter is to be discussed further by the Governments concerned with a view to reaching full agreement before the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Agreement. Without prejudice to any agreement which may thus be reached as to the currency in which payment is to be made, currency options should, in those cases where the contract provides for payment of a fixed amount of the alternative currency, be considered valid as exchange guarantees; *e.g.,* any creditor holding a loan contract containing such a currency option shall be entitled to receive in the currency of the country in which the loan was issued the equivalent, at the rate of exchange current on the date payment falls due, of the amount of the alternative currency which would have been payable if the option had been exercised.  

29. For the purpose of the settlements foreseen in the Agreed Recommendations, except as otherwise provided, *e.g.,* in the case of the Young Loan, the following shall apply: In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs, the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollar equalling 1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 gold Swiss franc, and the new contracts shall be expressed in currency dollars or currency Swiss francs respectively. In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding German currency debts with gold clauses-see Appendices 4 and 6) the amounts due shall be payable only in the currency of the country in which the loan was raised or the issue was made (below referred to as “the currency of issue”), the amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rate of exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in United States dollars which shall be arrived at by converting the amount of the obligation expressed in the currency of issue into United States dollars at the rate of exchange ruling when the loan was raised or the issue made. The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be less than if it were computed at the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952.  

30. On the question of the gold clause in general the Tripartite Commission informed the Conference that, as part of the arrangements agreed on in order to make a comprehensive settlement of the German debt problem possible, the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America had decided that, in so far as the German Debt settlement was concerned, gold clauses should not be maintained but might be replaced by some form of exchange guarantee. With respect to the Young Loan, they of course regarded it as essential that the equality of treatment for the different issues of that Loan provided for under the loan contract should be maintained. The representatives of the European bondholders have expressed their regret at the decision to depart from the contractual right of the bondholders of this international Loan to payment in their own currencies on a gold basis. They have inserted in the “Agreed Recommendations for the Settlement of Reich debts and debts of other public authorities” (Appendix 3) the provision there included solely in view of this Governmental decision. Corresponding provisions had been included in other reports where appropriate.  

31. Appendix 7 contains agreed recommendations for the treatment of payments made to the Konversionskasse problem.  

32. Deutsche Mark balances which accrue to a foreign creditor as the result of the settlement of a German debt falling under the Plan should be available for use substantially in accordance with the provisions at present in force in the Federal Republic of Germany, including the transfer of the balances to other non-residents of Germany. Agreed recommendations for the utilisation of Deutsche Mark accounts are set out in Appendix 8.  

33. Consideration has been given to the question whether it is necessary to recommend the enactment of legislation in the creditor countries to limit the activities of creditors in seeking settlement of their claims against Germany. The conclusion has been reached that such legislation is not essential to the successful functioning of the Settlement Plan.  

34. The Conference considers that the recommendations made in this Report conform to the principles set forth in paragraph 11.  

35. The representatives of private creditors who have participated in the Conference will recommend to the individual creditors that the terms of the Settlement Plan should be accepted, so far as they are concerned.  

36. The Government of the Federal Republic should undertake to accelerate the technical preparations necessary to ensure the effective carrying out of the present proposals by the dates indicated in the respective Appendices.  

37. The Conference expresses the hope that the Trustees concerned in the administration of loans will feel able to make their services available for the execution of the terms of the Settlement Plan.  

38. In the interest of the re-establishment of Germany's credit abroad and in the interest of the creditors whose claims have gone unsettled for many years, the recommendations contained in this Report should be dealt with by the interested Governments without delay, with a view to entering into an Intergovernmental Agreement to give international authority to the Settlement Plan simultaneously with a settlement of the Federal Republic's debts in respect of post-war economic assistance.   Adopted at the Plenary Meeting of the Conference held on 8th August, 1952.

*Londen, 27 Februari 1953*  De Regeringen van België, Canada, Ceylon, Denemarken, de Franse Republiek, Griekenland, Iran, Ierland, Italië, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Noorwegen, Pakistan, Spanje, Zweden, Zwitserland, de Unie van Zuid-Afrika, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland, de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en Zuidslavië aan de ene zijde, en De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland aan de andere zijde, Het gewenst achtend, de belemmeringen van een normaal economisch verkeer tussen de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en andere landen weg te nemen en daardoor een bijdrage tot de ontwikkeling van een welvarende gemeenschap van volkeren te leveren; Overwegende dat de betalingen op Duitse buitenlandse schulden in het algemeen gedurende ongeveer twintig jaar niet in overeenstemming met de contractuele bepalingen zijn geschied; dat van 1939 tot 1945 het bestaan van een staat van oorlog het doen van alle betalingen met betrekking tot vele van deze schulden heeft belet; dat sinds 1945 deze betalingen in het algemeen zijn opgeschort; en dat de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland een einde wenst te maken aan deze toestand; Overwegende dat Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika sinds 8 Mei 1945 economische hulp aan Duitsland hebben verleend, welke wezenlijk tot de opbouw van de Duitse economie heeft bijgedragen, waardoor de hervatting van de betalingen op de Duitse buitenlandse schulden is vergemakkelijkt; Overwegende dat op 6 Maart 1951 een briefwisseling, welke in afschrift in Aanhangsel A van deze Overeenkomst is opgenomen, heeft plaatsgevonden tussen de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, welke de basis vormt, waarop deze Overeenkomst voor de regeling van de Duitse buitenlandse schulden (met haar Bijlagen) en de overeenkomsten voor de regeling van de schulden uit hoofde van de aan Duitsland verleende economische hulp berusten; Overwegende dat de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika een commissie, genaamd de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden, hebben ingesteld met het doel, om in overleg met de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, met andere belanghebbende Regeringen en met vertegenwoordigers van de belanghebbende crediteuren en debiteuren een schema voor de regelmatige afwikkeling van het geheel der Duitse buitenlandse schulden voor te bereiden en uit te werken; Overwegende dat deze Commissie de vertegenwoordigers van de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland er van heeft verwittigd, dat de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika bereid waren belangrijke concessies te doen met betrekking tot de voorrang van hun vorderingen uit hoofde van na-oorlogse economische hulp ten opzichte van alle andere buitenlandse vorderingen tegen Duitsland en Duitse onderdanen en met betrekking tot het totale bedrag van deze vorderingen op voorwaarde, dat een bevredigende en billijke regeling voor de vooroorlogse buitenlandse schulden van Duitsland zou worden bereikt; Overwegende dat een dergelijke regeling van de Duitse buitenlandse schulden alleen zou kunnen worden bereikt door een enkelvoudig allesomvattend schema, dat rekening zou houden met de onderlinge verhoudingen van de verschillende crediteurbelangen, de aard van de verschillende soorten van vorderingen en de algemene toestand van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland; Overwegende dat er, teneinde dit doel te bereiken, van 28 Februari 1952 tot 8 Augustus 1952 te Londen een Internationale Conferentie inzake de Duitse buitenlandse schulden is gehouden, waaraan werd deelgenomen door vertegenwoordigers van de belanghebbende Regeringen en van de belanghebbende crediteuren en debiteuren; Overwegende dat deze vertegenwoordigers overeenstemming over een aantal aanbevelingen met betrekking tot de regelingsmodaliteiten en -procedures hebben bereikt (waarvan de teksten als Bijlagen I tot en met VI bij deze Overeenkomst zijn opgenomen); dat deze aanbevelingen waren toegevoegd aan het Rapport van de Conferentie inzake de Duitse buitenlandse schulden (waarvan de tekst als Aanhangsel B bij deze Overeenkomst is opgenomen); en dat deze Overeenkomst is geïnspireerd door de beginselen en doelstellingen, welke in het bovengenoemde Rapport zijn uitgedrukt; Overwegende dat de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, bevonden hebbende, dat deze aanbevelingen een bevredigend en billijk schema voor de regeling van de Duitse buitenlandse schulden inhouden, heden met de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland bilaterale overeenkomsten hebben ondertekend voor de regeling van schulden uit hoofde van de door deze drie Regeringen verleende na-oorlogse economische hulp, waarin hun gewijzigde rechten en voorrangen in dit verband zijn vastgelegd;

Verschillen in de behandeling van de verschillende soorten van schulden, welke voortvloeien uit regelingen in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen, worden niet als discriminatie of bevoorrechting beschouwd.

### Artikel  10  

####Beperking en uitsluiting van betalingen

De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal tot de volledige nakoming van alle verplichtingen uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen waarborgen, dat geen betalingen verricht worden voor verplichtingen, welke, hoewel zij vallen onder de leden (1) en (2) van Artikel 4, verschuldigd zijn aan een andere Regering dan die van een crediteurland of aan een persoon, die noch gevestigd is in, noch onderdaan is van een crediteurland, en welke in een niet-Duitse valuta betaalbaar zijn of waren. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing op schulden uit hoofde van courante effecten, welke in een crediteurland betaalbaar zijn.  

### Artikel  11  

####Valuta's, waarin betalingen dienen te geschieden

(1).  

(a) Voorzover in de Bijlagen van deze Overeenkomst niet anders is bepaald, dient een schuld zonder valuta-optie-clausule te worden betaald in de valuta, waarin zij volgens de bepalingen van de verbintenis betaalbaar is. Schulden, welke in een Duitse valuta zijn uitgedrukt en volgens de bepalingen van de Bijlagen van deze Overeenkomst in een niet-Duitse valuta dienen te worden betaald, zullen in de valuta van het land, waarin de crediteur gevestigd is, worden betaald.  

(b) Ongeacht de bepalingen onder (*a*) van dit lid zijn de telkens tussen de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en de Regering van een crediteurland bestaande betalingsovereenkomsten van toepassing op schulden, welke volgens het gestelde onder (*a*) in een niet-Duitse valuta dienen te worden betaald aan in dit land gevestigde personen. Op betalingen met betrekking tot in effecten belichaamde schulden, welke in een andere niet-Duitse valuta dan die van het land dat partij is bij een dergelijke betalingsovereenkomst zijn uitgedrukt, zijn deze betalingsovereenkomsten echter slechts van toepassing, indien de Regering van het betreffende land er mee instemt, dat dergelijke betalingen aan in dit land gevestigde personen in zijn valuta geschieden.     
(2).  

(a) Over de vraag, of met betrekking tot schulden met een valuta-optie-clausule ook in de toekomst betaling kan worden geëist in een andere valuta dan die van het land, waarin de lening opgenomen of van waaruit het crediet verstrekt is, zal op een door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en de Regeringen van de landen, welker valuta's hierbij betrokken zijn, overeen te komen wijze worden beslist.  

(b) Indien een valuta-optie-clausule de mogelijkheid van betaling van een vastgesteld bedrag in een alternatieve valuta bevat, heeft de crediteur het recht, de tegenwaarde van het bedrag van de alternatieve valuta, hetwelk bij uitoefening van de optie betaald had moeten worden, tegen de op de vervaldatum geldende wisselkoers te ontvangen in de valuta van het land, waarin de lening opgenomen of van waaruit het crediet verstrekt is.  

(c) Betalingen met betrekking tot schulden met een valuta-optieclausule, welke voor het nemen van de onder (*a*) van dit lid bedoelde beslissing in de valuta van het land, waarin de lening opgenomen of van waaruit het crediet verstrekt is, zijn verricht, worden niet door een dergelijke beslissing beïnvloed.     
(3).  De bepalingen van lid (1) en (2) van dit Artikel zijn niet van toepassing op schulden, welke onder de bepalingen van de punten 2 en 3 van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst vallen.   
(4).  De telkens tussen de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en de Regering van een crediteurland bestaande betalingsovereenkomsten zijn op de betaling van schulden, welke onder de bepalingen van lid (2) en (3) van dit Artikel vallen, van toepassing, mits de betaling in de valuta van het crediteurland dient te geschieden.   
(5).  Indien schulden zijn ontstaan uit zakelijke transacties van een geregistreerd filiaal van een crediteur, welke contractueel zouden moeten worden betaald in het land, waarin dit filiaal is gelegen, geldt dit land als crediteurland in de zin van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  12  

####De behandeling van goud-clausules

Bij de regeling en de voldoening van een in een niet-Duitse valuta uitgedrukte schuld op goud-basis of met een goud-clausule, dient het te betalen bedrag, voorzover niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald in de Bijlagen van deze Overeenkomst, als volgt te worden berekend: 

(a) Bij een schuld, welke volgens de ten tijde van de regeling geldende bepalingen van de verbintenis uitgedrukt of betaalbaar is in U.S.-dollars of Zwitserse francs op goud-basis of met een goud-clausule, wordt het te betalen bedrag zonder inachtneming van de goud-basis of de goud-clausule bepaald. Elke nieuwe overeenkomst tussen de crediteur en de debiteur met betrekking tot een dergelijke schuld moet in U.S.-dollars of Zwitserse francs luiden en mag geen verwijzing naar de goudwaarde van een dergelijke valuta inhouden en geen goud-clausule bevatten.  

(b) Bij een schuld, welke volgens de ten tijde van de regeling geldende bepalingen van de verbintenis uitgedrukt of betaalbaar is in een andere niet-Duitse valuta op goud-basis of met een goud-clausule, wordt het te betalen bedrag als volgt bepaald: 

(I) het verschuldigde nominale bedrag wordt tegen de op de datum van de totstandkoming van de schuld of bij in effecten belichaamde schulden tegen de op de datum van de uitgifte van deze effecten geldende wisselkoers in U.S.-dollars omgerekend;  

(II) het aldus verkregen dollarbedrag wordt in de valuta, waarin de schuld volgens Artikel 11 betaald dient te worden, tegen de op de vervaldatum geldende wisselkoers tussen de U.S.-dollars en de betrokken valuta omgerekend, behalve ingeval de wisselkoers tussen de U.S.-dollar en de betrokken valuta op de vervaldatum ongunstiger is voor de crediteur dan op 1 Augustus 1952, in welk geval de wisselkoers van 1 Augustus 1952 van toepassing zal zijn.      

### Artikel  13  

####Wisselkoersen

In de gevallen, waarin een bedrag volgens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen op basis van een wisselkoers dient te worden berekend, zal deze koers, behalve in de in Bijlage III en in artikel 8 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde gevallen: 

(a) bepaald worden door de pariteiten, welke in overeenstemming met lid 1 van Artikel IV van de Overeenkomst inzake het Internationale Monetaire Fonds met dit Fonds zijn overeengekomen en dientengevolge op de betreffende datum voor de bedoelde valuta's gelden; of  

(b) ingeval op de betreffende datum geen zodanige pariteiten gelden of golden, de wisselkoers zijn, welke in een bilaterale betalingsovereenkomst tussen de bedoelde landen of hun monetaire instellingen voor het lopende betalingsverkeer is overeengekomen; of  

(c) ingeval op de betreffende datum noch pariteiten noch koersen op grond van bilaterale overeenkomsten gelden of golden, de algemeen in het handelsverkeer gebruikelijke middenkoers zijn, welke voor telegrafische overmakingen in de valuta van het land, waarin de betaling dient te geschieden, op de voornaamste beurs in het andere land op de betreffende datum of in voorkomend geval op de daaraan voorafgaande dag geldt of gold; of  

(d) ingeval op de betreffende datum geen wisselkoers als hierboven onder (*a*), (*b*) of (*c*) bedoeld bestaat of bestond, de als crossrate of exchange aangeduide wisselkoers zijn, welke uit de op deze datum of in voorkomend geval op de daaraan voorafgaande dag geldende middenkoersen van de bedoelde valuta's op de voornaamste beurs in een derde land, waarin deze valuta's genoteerd worden, kan worden berekend.    

### Artikel  14  

####Schulden in Duitse valuta

(1).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal soortgelijke maatregelen als bedoeld in punt 6 van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst treffen met betrekking tot alle Rijksmarkschulden, waarvoor zij de aansprakelijkheid heeft overgenomen of zal overnemen en welke niet onder evengenoemd punt vallen.   
(2).  Bij toepassing van het beginsel van gelijkberechtiging met Duitse onderdanen zal de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland bovendien waarborgen, dat in Rijksmark-effecten belichaamde schulden, welke geen goudmarkschulden met een specifiek buitenlands karakter zijn en op 21 Juni 1948 tegenover personen, die op die datum onderdanen waren van of gevestigd waren in een crediteurland, bestonden, en waarvan volgens de in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) geldende wetgeving slechts voor een bepaald deel betaling kan worden afgedwongen, op gelijke wijze worden voldaan als soortgelijke verplichtingen tegenover personen, die in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) zijn gevestigd.   
(3).  Bij de regeling van andere in Duitse valuta betaalbare schulden tegenover onderdanen van crediteurlanden, die in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) zijn gevestigd, zullen de modaliteiten niet ongunstiger zijn dan die, welke voor soortgelijke verplichtingen tegenover andere in dit gebied gevestigde personen worden toegestaan.   

### Artikel  15  

####Aanvaarding door de crediteuren

(1).  Slechts die crediteuren, die met betrekking tot in effecten belichaamde schulden, voor welker regeling een regelingsaanbod is voorgeschreven, een dergelijke regeling aanvaarden, of met betrekking tot andere schulden met de vaststelling van de betalings- en andere modaliteiten in overeenstemming met de daarvoor in aanmerking komende bepalingen instemmen, zijn gerechtigd van de in deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen voorziene voordelen gebruik te maken.   
(2).  

(a) Met betrekking tot in effecten belichaamde schulden, voor welker regeling een regelingsaanbod is voorgeschreven, geschiedt de aanvaarding van het regelingsaanbod in de zin van lid (1) van dit Artikel door inlevering van de oude effecten of coupons; 

(I) ter inruiling, indien nieuwe effecten of coupons worden uitgegeven, of  

(II) ter verkrijging van een opschrift, indien de regelingsmodaliteiten op de oude effecten worden aangegeven.    

(b) De houder van een effect, hetwelk onder Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst valt en waarvoor een regelingsaanbod is gedaan, kan binnen een termijn van tenminste vijf jaar na de datum, waarop dit aanbod is gedaan, dit aanbod aanvaarden. Indien daartoe gegronde redenen aanwezig zijn, dient de debiteur deze termijn te verlengen.     
(3).  Met betrekking tot schulden, die niet onder lid 2 (*a*) van dit Artikel vallen, wordt, voorzover geen bepaalde voorschriften in een Bijlage van deze Overeenkomst zijn neergelegd, de instemming van de crediteur met de vaststelling van de betalings- en andere modaliteiten in de zin van lid (1) van dit Artikel aanwezig geacht, indien de crediteur op enigerlei wijze duidelijk van zijn instemming doet blijken.   
(4).  Een debiteur is slechts onderworpen aan de bepalingen, welke in deze Overeenkomst en de desbetreffende Bijlagen voor de regeling van schulden zijn voorgeschreven, indien hij met betrekking tot zijn schuld een regelingsaanbod in overeenstemming met de daarvoor in aanmerking komende Bijlage van deze Overeenkomst heeft gedaan of een kennisgeving van toetreding of een verklaring van deelname heeft afgegeven. De in dit lid neergelegde bepaling laat de voorzieningen van Artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst echter onaangetast.   
(5).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is gerechtigd, bij de uitvoering van Artikel 2 van deze Overeenkomst rekening te houden met het gestelde in de vorige leden van dit Artikel.   

### Artikel  16  

####Bevrijding van de debiteur

Indien een debiteur zijn in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen geregelde schuld heeft voldaan, wordt hij geacht daardoor tevens aan alle verplichtingen uit hoofde van deze schuld, zoals deze voor de regeling bestond te hebben voldaan, tenzij dergelijke verplichtingen reeds op grond van een overeenkomst teniet waren gegaan.  

### Artikel  17  

####Afdwinging van rechten door crediteuren

(1).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de crediteur het recht verlenen, binnen de grenzen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen door middel van een Duitse rechtbank en met behulp van Duitse instanties: 

(a) zijn rechten, met betrekking tot een schuld, zoals deze bestaan op het tijdstip, waarop hij krachtens dit artikel stappen onderneemt, af te dwingen indien de crediteur en de debiteur geen overeenstemming over de regelingsmodaliteiten bereiken en de crediteur instemt met de vaststelling van de betalings- en andere modaliteiten voor zijn schuld door een Duitse rechtbank in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen;  

(b) zijn rechten uit hoofde van de bepalingen van de voor de schuld getroffen regeling af te dwingen indien de debiteur zijn verplichtingen niet in overeenstemming met deze bepalingen vervult (met inbegrip van de rechten, welke de crediteur volgens deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen kan uitoefenen, indien de debiteur zijn verplichtingen niet vervult), met dien verstande, dat de crediteur niet eerder gerechtigd zal zijn, transfer van de tengevolge van de niet-voldoening van een schuld opeisbaar wordende hoofdsom te eisen dan het geval zou zijn, indien de debiteur zijn verplichtingen zou hebben vervuld.     
(2).  De crediteur zal het in lid (1) van dit Artikel bedoelde recht niet verleend worden, indien de kennisneming van het geschil volgens de bepalingen van de desbetreffende overeenkomst of van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen op het moment, waarop het in lid (1) van dit Artikel bedoelde recht wordt uitgeoefend, uitsluitend aan een scheidsgerecht of een rechtbank in een crediteurland is voorbehouden. Indien een dergelijke exclusieve bevoegdheid in de bepalingen van de desbetreffende overeenkomst is neergelegd, mogen de crediteur en de debiteur daar bij onderlinge overeenstemming afstand van doen en zal de crediteur daarna het in lid (1) van dit Artikel bedoelde recht verkrijgen.   
(3).  

(a) Ongeacht de vraag, of de wederkerigheid op het gebied van de erkenning en tenuitvoerlegging van vonnissen tussen het land, waar de uitspraak is gedaan, en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland in acht wordt genomen, zal de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland de crediteur het recht verlenen, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de leden (1) en (4) van dit Artikel door middel van een Duitse rechtbank en met behulp van Duitse instanties de tenuitvoerlegging van beslissingen van rechterlijke colleges en scheidsrechterlijke instanties af te dwingen: 

(I) in een crediteurland na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst;  

(II) in een crediteurland voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst, indien de debiteur de in de beslissing vastgestelde schuld niet bestrijdt.    

(b) In andere procedures met betrekking tot schulden, welke het onderwerp van een eindbeslissing van een rechterlijk college of scheidsrechterlijke instantie in een crediteurland van voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst vormen, zullen Duitse rechtbanken de feiten, waarop een dergelijke beslissing berust, bewezen achten, tenzij de debiteur het tegendeel bewijst. In dit geval is de crediteur gerechtigd, tegenbewijsmiddelen aan te voeren en daarbij van de processtukken van het vroegere proces gebruik te maken. Het bedrag van een niet-contractuele financiële verbintenis, hetwelk in een krachtens dit lid gevoerde procedure bij beslissing van een Duitse rechtbank wordt vastgesteld, zal in de zin van lid (1) (*a*) van Artikel 4 van deze Overeenkomst worden geacht te zijn vastgesteld op het tijdstip, waarop de eindbeslissing van de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke instantie in een crediteurland is genomen.  

(c) De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de crediteur het recht verlenen, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van lid (1) van dit Artikel langs gerechtelijke weg in Duitsland en met behulp van Duitse instanties de tenuitvoerlegging van eindbeslissingen van rechterlijke colleges en scheidsrechterlijke instanties, welke voor 8 Mei 1945 in Duitsland of na 8 Mei 1945 in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) zijn genomen, af te dwingen.     
(4).  De Duitse rechtbanken kunnen weigeren, beslissingen van een buitenlands rechterlijk college of scheidsrechterlijke instantie (uitgezonderd een op grond van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen opgericht scheidsgerecht) in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van lid (3) van dit Artikel te erkennen en ten uitvoer te doen leggen: 

(a) indien het rechterlijk college, hetwelk de beslissing heeft genomen, niet bevoegd was of de bevoegdheid van het scheidsgerecht, hetwelk de beslissing heeft gewezen, niet op een overeenkomst tussen de betrokken partijen berustte; of  

(b) indien de debiteur in het proces voor de oorspronkelijke rechtbank of het oorspronkelijk scheidsgerecht niet in de gelegenheid is gesteld, zijn standpunt te verdedigen;  

(c) indien de tenuitvoerlegging van de beslissing in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, waarbij het feit, dat een vonnis niet met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen in overeenstemming is, niet als reden mag worden beschouwd, om de tenuitvoerlegging daarvan in het kader van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen in strijd met de openbare orde in de zin van deze bepaling te achten.     
(5).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de in Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde Organisaties van Effectenbezitters en soortgelijke lichamen en de in artikel VIII van Bijlage II bedoelde crediteurenvertegenwoordigers het recht verlenen, de modaliteiten van het regelingsaanbod door middel van Duitse rechtbanken en met behulp van Duitse instanties te doen vaststellen, indien de debiteur (uitgezonderd de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland) nalaat, een voorstel tot regeling van zijn in effecten belichaamde schuld in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende bepalingen van Bijlagen I en II van deze Overeenkomst te doen.   
(6).  

(a) Een debiteur, die nalaat, een regelingsaanbod in overeenstemming met Bijlagen I en II van deze Overeenkomst voor te stellen, is in een volgens de leden (1), (3) en (5) van dit Artikel voor een Duitse rechtbank aanhangig gemaakte procedure niet gerechtigd, een beroep te doen op de in punt 7 lid (1) onder *(e)* van Bijlage I of in artikel V lid 11 van Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde hardheidsclausule. Bij de vaststelling van de bepalingen van het regelingsaanbod of van de modaliteiten voor de regeling van de schuld dient de rechtbank de vroegste vervaldatum voor te schrijven, welke volgens de bepalingen van de desbetreffende Bijlage voor de regeling van de schuld is toegestaan. De rechtbank dient in zijn vonnis te bepalen, dat de debiteur de in punt 7 onder *k* van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst of in artikel X lid 2 van Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde kosten aan de eiser dient te vergoeden; deze kosten zijn aanstonds opeisbaar en betaalbaar. De rechtbank dient de debiteur verder te veroordelen tot betaling van de proceskosten en van alle redelijke in verband met de procedure gemaakte kosten en gedane uitgaven van de crediteur in gevallen van niet in effecten belichaamde schulden en van de Organisatie van Effectenbezitters of een soortgelijk lichaam of van de crediteurenvertegenwoordiger of vertegenwoordigers in gevallen van in effecten belichaamde schulden.  

(b) Indien een debiteur nalaat, tot toetreding als bedoeld in artikel 22 van Bijlage III van deze Overeenkomst over te gaan, is de crediteur gerechtigd, in een volgens lid (1) of (3) van dit Artikel aanhangig gemaakte procedure zijn rechten in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de evengenoemde Bijlage af te dwingen, echter niet, voorzover het rechtstreeks door een Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur in de zin van de genoemde Bijlage aan de crediteur verschuldigde schulden betreft, voordat er dertig dagen na de eerste bijeenkomst van het in artikel 17 van genoemde Bijlage bedoelde Raadgevend Comité zijn verstreken. Indien de rechtbank de debiteur tot betaling van de schuld in overeenstemming met de genoemde Bijlage veroordeelt, zal het de debiteur tevens veroordelen tot vergoeding van de proceskosten en van alle redelijke in verband met de procedure gemaakte kosten en gedane uitgaven van de crediteur.  

(c) Een debiteur, die nalaat, de volgens artikel 14 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst vereiste verklaring van toetreding te geven, is in een volgens lid (1) of (3) van dit Artikel aanhangig gemaakte procedure voor een Duitse rechtbank niet gerechtigd, een beroep te doen op de in artikel 11 van genoemde Bijlage bedoelde hardheidsclausule. Indien de debiteur de afgifte van de verklaring slechts heeft nagelaten, omdat hij het bestaan van de schuld ontkent, verliest hij het recht, om een beroep op de hardheidsclausule te doen, tenzij hij, ingeval de in artikel 15 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde rechtbank of het aldaar bedoelde scheidsgerecht het bestaan van de schuld bevestigt, binnen dertig dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum, waarop de eindbeslissing van een dergelijke rechtbank is betekend, de vereiste verklaring afgeeft. Indien de debiteur in een procedure volgens dit onderdeel van dit lid van dit Artikel niet gerechtigd is een beroep op de hardheidsclausule te doen, dient de rechtbank hem tot betaling van de proceskosten en van de redelijk gemaakte kosten voor juridische bijstand van de eiser te veroordelen.     
(7).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de crediteur het recht verlenen, binnen de grenzen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen door middel van Duitse rechtbanken en met behulp van Duitse instanties zijn vorderingen tegen een persoon, die in het gebied van de Duitse mark (Oost) gevestigd is, op diens in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) gelegen vermogensbestanddelen te verhalen, indien deze vorderingen uit een verbintenis voortspruiten, welke, afgezien van de vereisten met betrekking tot de plaats van vestiging van de debiteur, aan de vereisten van Artikel 4 van deze Overeenkomst voldoet. Op het recht tot transfer in vreemde valuta's van de op deze wijze door de crediteur ontvangen bedragen zullen de telkenmale in het gebied van de Duitse mark (West) geldende deviezenbepalingen van toepassing zijn.   

### Artikel  18  

####Verjaringstermijnen

(1).  Een debiteur zal niet het recht hebben om zich bij het opstellen van een regelingsaanbod of bij de regeling van een schuld te beroepen op het verstrijken van een verjaringstermijn of een vervaltermijn, voor het geldend maken van aanspraken met betrekking tot die schuld, voorzover die niet vóór 1 Juni 1933 is verstreken, tenzij op een datum, die zal worden bepaald door bedoelde termijnen als opgeschort te beschouwen vanaf 1 Juni 1933 tot aan het aflopen van een periode van 18 maanden, te rekenen vanaf de datum, waarop deze Overeenkomst en de desbetreffende Bijlage van toepassing zullen worden op die schuld.   
(2).  Onverminderd het bepaalde in lid (1) van dit Artikel, worden, met het oog op het opstellen van een regeling, de in lid (1) bedoelde termijnen van verjaring en van verval, die van toepassing zijn op in effecten belichaamde schulden als bedoeld in de delen A en B van Bijlage I en op die behandeld in Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst, geacht niet te zijn verstreken vóór de datum, waarop, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in punt 8 *(b)* van Bijlage I en Artikel 15 van deze Overeenkomst, het regelingsaanbod van de debiteur niet meer door de crediteur kan worden aanvaard.   
(3).  Aanvaardt een crediteur een regelingsaanbod of verklaart hij zich accoord met een regeling voor een schuld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in Artikel 15 van deze Overeenkomst, dan worden daarmede de verjaringstermijnen en de vervaltermijnen voor het geldend maken van aanspraken met betrekking tot die schuld opgeschort.   
(4).  Onder de verjaringstermijnen en vervaltermijnen, bedoeld in de leden (1), (2) en (3) van dit Artikel worden niet verstaan de termijnen voor het in beroep gaan van rechterlijke beslissingen, van scheidsrechterlijke of administratieve beslissingen, noch de termijnen, bedoeld in lid 3 van Deel 12 van de Duitse wet op de verzekeringsovereenkomst, noch de termijnen vastgesteld in de Duitse wetten betreffende de effectenzuivering.   
(5).  De voorgaande bepalingen zullen toepassing vinden, ongeacht de vraag of de termijnen zijn vastgesteld door het Duitse recht of door het recht van een ander land, door een rechterlijke beslissing, een scheidsrechterlijke of een administratieve beslissing, door een overeenkomst of door een andere rechtshandeling. De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal er zorg voor dragen, dat de voorgaande bepalingen ook dan zullen worden toegepast door de Duitse rechterlijke instanties, indien de schuldverhouding naar zijn inhoud onderworpen is aan buitenlands recht.   

### Artikel  19  

####Aanvullende overeenkomsten

(1).  De overeenkomsten op grond van onderhandelingen overeenkomstig 

(a) punt 11 van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst (vorderingen krachtens beslissingen van het gemengde Grieks-Duitse scheidsgerecht)  

(b) punt 15 van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst (aansprakelijkheid voor Oostenrijkse overheidsschulden)  

(c) artikel 10 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst (betalingen aan de Deutsche Verrechnungskasse)  

(d) Bijlage IV *a* van deze Overeenkomst (in Zwitserse francs luidende hypothecaire schulden);   zullen door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland (c.q. na door deze verleende goedkeuring) ter goedkeuring worden voorgelegd aan de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, van de Franse Republiek en van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland.   
(2).  Elk dier overeenkomsten zal van kracht worden, en in alle opzichten als een Bijlage bij deze Overeenkomst beschouwd worden, zodra daarop de goedkeuring van die Regeringen zal zijn verkregen. Alle Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst zullen daarvan worden verwittigd door de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland.   

### Artikel  20  

####Schulden van het Duitse Rijk uit hoofde van multilaterale overeenkomsten

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst verzetten zich niet tegen betalingen op schulden van het Rijk of van agenten van het Rijk, die voortvloeien uit niet betaalde bijdragen of uit diensten bewezen in het kader van een internationale multilaterale overeenkomst of van de statuten van een internationale organisatie. Op verzoek van de belanghebbende crediteuren zal de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland in directe onderhandelingen treden over deze schulden.  

### Artikel  21  

####Vernieuwing van Bijlage III

Onder „Bijlage III” van deze Overeenkomst moet mede worden verstaan elke overeenkomst die na de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst wordt afgesloten ter vernieuwing van de in die Bijlage vervatte overeenkomst. Dergelijke overeenkomsten kunnen de bepalingen van Bijlage III wijzigen, maar zullen er op gericht moeten zijn middelen en wegen te verschaffen om te geraken tot een herstel van de normale omstandigheden voor de financiering van de buitenlandse handel van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, overeenkomstig de algemene doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  22  

####Vorderingen uit hoofde van sociale verzekeringen

(1).  De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal in onderhandeling treden met de Regeringen der betrokken crediteurlanden, ter regeling van vorderingen uit hoofde van sociale verzekeringen, ontstaan ten gevolge van de toepassing van Duitse wetten en regelingen, welke vóór 8 Mei 1945 van kracht waren, gedurende een periode voorafgaande aan 8 Mei 1945, voorzover die vorderingen volgens de wetgeving van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of overeenkomstig door haar op zich genomen verplichtingen moeten worden geacht te komen te haren laste of ten laste van instellingen voor sociale verzekeringen in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, en voor zover die vorderingen niet reeds zijn behandeld in een overeenkomst met de Regering van het betrokken crediteurland. Het in dit lid bepaalde verzet zich niet tegen het opnemen in dergelijke overeenkomsten van bepalingen, ingevolge welke wetten of regelingen, geldend in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland op het stuk van sociale verzekeringen, die voor onderdanen van andere landen een minder gunstige behandeling inhouden dan voor Duitse onderdanen, geen toepassing zullen vinden.   
(2).  De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de nodige maatregelen nemen met het oog op de regeling van de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde vorderingen, die niet behandeld zijn in overeenkomsten met de Regeringen van de crediteurlanden, en met het oog op de transfer in verband daarmede, op voorwaarde, dat het vorderingen van onderdanen en ingezetenen betreft van een crediteurland, vanwaar betalingen terzake van dergelijke vorderingen getransfereerd kunnen worden ten gunste van onderdanen of ingezetenen van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland. De in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland op het stuk van sociale verzekeringen geldende wetten en regelingen, die voor onderdanen van andere landen een minder gunstige behandeling inhouden dan voor Duitse onderdanen, zullen geen toepassing vinden, indien het betrokken crediteurland, wat betreft de betalingen van sociale renten, niet discrimineert tussen eigen onderdanen en Duitse onderdanen of tussen eigen ingezetenen en ingezetenen van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland.   
(3).  De in lid (1) van dit Artikel bedoelde vorderingen, uit hoofde van sociale verzekeringen, van onderdanen of ingezetenen van een crediteurland, welke niet krachtens lid (1) of overeenkomstig lid (2) van dit Artikel zullen worden geregeld, zullen volgens het bepaalde in artikel 28 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst worden geregeld.   

### Artikel  23  

####Schulden uit het verzekeringsverkeer

(1).  Als bilaterale regelingen, die getroffen zijn teneinde uitvoering te geven aan artikel 30, lid (1) van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst, bepalingen bevatten, welke betrekking hebben op de transfer van betalingen of op betaling in Duitse mark van schulden, die voortvloeien uit verzekerings- of herverzekeringscontracten of -overeenkomsten van welke aard ook, of die met dergelijke contracten of overeenkomsten samenhangen, dan moeten die bepalingen in overeenstemming zijn met die terzake van de regeling van de andere soorten schulden.   
(2).  Als op 30 Juni 1953 geen bilaterale regelingen zullen zijn getroffen, zullen de schulden uit hoofde van verzekerings- of herverzekeringscontracten geregeld worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 30, lid (2) en van artikel 31 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst. De termijn van 30 Juni 1953 kan na het bereiken van onderlinge overeenstemming worden verlengd. De gunstigste voorwaarden, voorkomende in enige bilaterale regeling, gesloten overeenkomstig lid (1) van dit Artikel met betrekking tot de transfer van betalingen van welke categorie schulden ook, of met betrekking tot de betaling in Duitse mark van die schulden, zullen toepassing vinden op de schulden van dezelfde categorie jegens crediteuren, die gevestigd zijn in landen, waarmede geen bilaterale regelingen zullen zijn getroffen.   

### Artikel  24  

####Toepasselijkheid van de Overeenkomst op Berlijn

(1).  Met inachtneming van het bepaalde in lid (2) (*b*) van Artikel 4 en in lid (5) van Artikel 5, zal deze Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn op Berlijn, dat binnen de grenzen van zijn bevoegdheid verplichtingen, overeenkomend met die, welke de Bondsrepubliek uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomsten en de bijbehorende Bijlagen op zich neemt, zal nakomen.   
(2).  Deze Overeenkomst zal voor Berlijn in werking treden bij of na haar inwerkingtreding overeenkomstig lid (2) van Artikel 35, zodra de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland bij de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland een verklaring zal deponeren, waaruit zal blijken, dat in Berlijn alle wettelijke maatregelen, nodig voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst op Berlijn, zijn genomen.   

### Artikel  25  

####Herziening van de Overeenkomst bij de hereniging van Duitsland

De Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst zullen deze herzien bij de hereniging van Duitsland. Deze herziening zal uitsluitend tot doel hebben: 

(a) het toepassen van de bepalingen van de Bijlagen bij deze Overeenkomst met betrekking tot het aanpassen van bepaalde schulden ingeval van hereniging, voorzover die bepalingen dan niet automatisch toepassing gaan vinden;  

(b) het uitbreiden van de toepassing der bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst op schulden van personen, woonachtig in het met de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland herenigde gebied;  

(c) het uitvoeren van een billijke aanpassing met betrekking tot schulden, waarvan de regeling is vastgesteld, rekening houdend met het verlies van bepaalde zich in het met de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland herenigde gebied bevindende vermogenswaarden, of met de onmogelijkheid daarover te beschikken.    

### Artikel  26  

####Vroeger getroffen overeenkomsten

Geen der bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst zal geacht worden de geldigheid van enige andere overeenkomst tot regeling van verplichtingen, door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland gesloten voor het in werking treden van deze Overeenkomst, aan te tasten.  

### Artikel  27  

####Voorrang van deze Overeenkomst boven haar Bijlagen

Indien de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst niet in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van een der daarbij behorende Bijlagen, zijn de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst beslissend.  

### Artikel  28  

####Tribunaal van Arbitrage

(1).  Het Tribunaal van Arbitrage voor de Overeenkomst inzake Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hierna genoemd „het Tribunaal”) wordt opgericht voor de hierna te vermelden doeleinden. De samenstelling en de organisatie van het Tribunaal en de wijze van uitoefening van zijn rechtspleging zijn geregeld in het Statuut, hetwelk als Bijlage IX aan deze Overeenkomst is toegevoegd.   
(2).  Onverminderd de bepalingen van lid (5) van dit Artikel is het Tribunaal bij uitsluiting bevoegd kennis te nemen van alle geschillen tussen twee of meer Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst over de uitleg of de toepassing van de Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen, waarover de Partijen door middel van onderhandelingen niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen, met dien verstande, dat geschillen over de uitleg en de toepassing van Artikel 34 van deze Overeenkomst niet ter beoordeling van het Tribunaal of enig andere rechtbank of ander scheidsgerecht zullen staan. Indien de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland geen partij is bij een procedure voor het Tribunaal met betrekking tot een geschil tussen Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst, kan zij op verzoek van een der partijen bij het geschil als partij tot de procedure toetreden.   
(3).  Het Tribunaal is bij uitsluiting bevoegd tot beoordeling van de in artikel 16 lid 2 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde vraagstukken, welke voor de uitleg van de genoemde Bijlage van wezenlijke betekenis zijn en welke het door een Partij bij deze Overeenkomst voorgelegd krijgt. De bepalingen van dit lid tasten de bevoegdheid van de Gemengde Commissie, zoals deze in Artikel 31 lid 2 van deze Overeenkomst is geregeld, niet aan.   
(4).  Het Tribunaal is bij uitsluiting bevoegd tot behandeling van procedures in hoger beroep, welke in overeenstemming met Artikel 31 lid 7 van deze Overeenkomst aanhangig worden gemaakt.   
(5).  Onverminderd de bepalingen van de leden (3) en (4) van dit Artikel is het Tribunaal niet bevoegd kennis te nemen van geschillen, welke uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de uitleg of de toepassing van een Bijlage van deze Overeenkomst, indien een in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende Bijlage opgerichte scheidsrechterlijke instantie bevoegd is tot beoordeling van de met betrekking tot de uitleg of de toepassing gerezen vraag. Deze bepaling vormt geen beperking van de bevoegdheid van het Tribunaal met betrekking tot geschillen over de vraag, of een uitspraak van een dergelijke scheidsrechterlijke instantie in strijd is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   
(6).  Iedere Partij bij deze Overeenkomst, die belang heeft bij het onderwerp van een procedure voor het Tribunaal, is gerechtigd, als partij aan deze procedure deel te nemen.   
(7).  Het Tribunaal heeft het recht, te beslissen over vragen met betrekking tot zijn bevoegdheid krachtens de voorgaande bepalingen van dit Artikel.   
(8).  Een uitspraak van het Tribunaal is definitief en bindend 

(a) in een procedure volgens lid (2) van dit Artikel voor de partijen bij het geschil en voor elke andere Partij bij deze Overeenkomst, die als partij aan de procedure deelneemt;  

(b) in een procedure volgens lid (3) van dit Artikel voor de partij, die het vraagstuk aan het Tribunaal heeft voorgelegd, en voor elke andere Partij bij deze Overeenkomst, die als partij aan de procedure deelneemt;  

(c) in een procedure in hoger beroep volgens lid (4) van dit Artikel voor de partij of de partijen bij de procedure in hoger beroep.     
(9).  De bevoegdheid van het Tribunaal wordt niet aangetast door het feit, dat een partij bij het geschil niet bij de voor het Tribunaal aanhangig gemaakte procedure verschijnt.   
(10).  Alle in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen opgerichte scheidsrechterlijke instanties, uitgezonderd het Tribunaal zelf, zijn bij de beoordeling van de uitleg of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen door de daarvoor in aanmerking komende uitspraken van het Tribunaal gebonden.   
(11).  Op verzoek van een Partij bij deze Overeenkomst geeft het Tribunaal advies met betrekking tot de uitleg of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst (uitgezonderd de uitleg of de toepassing van Artikel 34 van deze Overeenkomst). Dergelijke adviezen hebben geen bindende kracht.   

### Artikel  29  

####Arbitrage over bepaalde geschillen volgens Bijlage I

(1).  Aan procedures voor een scheidsgerecht, hetwelk ter beoordeling van geschillen volgens punt 7 lid 1 onder (*g*) van Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst is voorzien, kunnen slechts Organisaties van Effectenbezitters en soortgelijke verenigingen, welke door de Regeringen van de landen, waarin zij gevormd zijn, als vertegenwoordigers van de effectenbezitters in deze landen erkend zijn (hierna genoemd „crediteurenvertegenwoordiging”), aan de ene kant en debiteuren aan de andere kant als partijen deelnemen.   
(2).  Een scheidsgerecht als bedoeld in het voorgaande lid bestaat, voorzover de partijen niet anders overeenkomen, uit drie als volgt benoemde leden: 

(a) een lid, hetwelk door de debiteur dient te worden benoemd;  

(b) een lid, hetwelk door de desbetreffende crediteurenvertegenwoordiging, of, indien er meer crediteurenvertegenwoordigingen bij betrokken zijn, door deze gezamenlijk dient te worden benoemd;  

(c) een derde lid als voorzitter, hetwelk door de op de hierboven onder (*a*) en (*b*) bedoelde wijze benoemde leden dient te worden gekozen. De voorzitter mag noch de Duitse nationaliteit noch de nationaliteit van een land, waarin een als partij aan de procedure deelnemende crediteuren vertegenwoordiging is gevormd, bezitten.     
(3).  Binnen 90 dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum, waarop een der partijen bij de procedure de andere partij de benoeming van haar scheidsrechter heeft meegedeeld, dient de andere partij eveneens een scheidsrechter te benoemen. Indien de andere partij haar scheidsrechter niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn benoemt, wordt deze op verzoek van de partij, die de mededeling heeft gedaan, door de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel benoemd.   
(4).  Indien de beide scheidsrechters niet binnen 30 dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum van benoeming van de laatstbenoemde scheidsrechter, overeenstemming over de keuze van een voorzitter bereiken, wordt deze op verzoek van een van beide scheidsrechters door de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel benoemd. De bepaling van lid (2) onder (*c*) van dit Artikel ten aanzien van de nationaliteit geldt ook voor deze benoeming.   
(5).  Indien een lid van het scheidsgerecht overlijdt of wegens ziekte, terugtrekking of niet-nakoming van zijn ambtsplichten uitvalt, wordt deze functie binnen 30 dagen, nadat zij is opengevallen, op dezelfde wijze als bij de oorspronkelijke benoeming opnieuw vervuld.   
(6).  Het scheidsgerecht stelt zelf de bij zijn rechtspleging te volgen regels vast. Indien dergelijke regels niet worden vastgesteld of niet toereikend zijn, dienen de door de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel vastgestelde regels met betrekking tot arbitrage te worden toegepast.   
(7).  De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht met betrekking tot de conversie, welke het onderwerp van de scheidsrechterlijke procedure vormde, is met het oog op de vaststelling van de bepalingen van het regelingsaanbod bindend voor de partijen bij de procedure en de crediteuren vertegenwoordiging dient de aanvaarding van het regelingsaanbod aan te bevelen aan de effectenbezitters, voorzover dit aanbod aan de andere in Bijlage I van deze Overeenkomst neergelegde voorwaarden voldoet.   

### Artikel  30  

####Inschakeling van Trustkantoren volgens Bijlage II

(1).  De volgens artikel IX van Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst opgerichte Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie doet het Trustkantoor voor een in effecten belichaamde schuld, waarop de genoemde Bijlage van toepassing is, mededeling van elke bij de Commissie aanhangige procedure over de regeling der schuld. Het Trustkantoor kan binnen 20 dagen na het doen van de mededeling als partij tot de procedure toetreden.   
(2).  Teneinde het Trustkantoor voor een in effecten belichaamde schuld bij de bevrijding van verplichtingen, welke dit tegenover de bezitters van deze effecten mocht hebben, te ondersteunen, zal de debiteur op het tijdstip, waarop hij in overeenstemming met artikel VII van Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst een voorstel voor een regelingsaanbod aan de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging aanbiedt, tevens een afschrift van dit voorstel aan het Trustkantoor voor deze effecten aanbieden. Het Trustkantoor kan de debiteur en de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging op de hoogte stellen van de bezwaren, welke het heeft tegen de modaliteiten van het aanbod waarover wordt onderhandeld, waarna deze bezwaren bij de behandeling ter beoordeling dienen te worden overgelegd.   
(3).  Voor het afsluiten van een definitieve overeenkomst met de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging over de modaliteiten van het regelingsaanbod dient de debiteur de modaliteiten van dit regelingsaanbod schriftelijk aan het Trustkantoor mede te delen. Binnen 10 dagen na ontvangst van deze mededeling kan het Trustkantoor bezwaren tegen de modaliteiten van het regelingsaanbod bij de Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie indienen met betrekking tot alle vraagstukken, ten aanzien waarvan het volgens de bepalingen van de bestaande overeenkomst van oordeel is, dat het verplichtingen tegenover de bezitters van deze effecten heeft. De Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie zal de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging en de debiteur mededeling doen van de opening van de procedure. De crediteurenvertegenwoordiging en de debiteur kunnen binnen 20 dagen na het doen van deze mededeling als partijen tot de procedure toetreden. De bevoegdheid van de Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie ten aanzien van een dergelijke procedure wordt niet aangetast door het feit, dat de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging of de debiteur niet bij de procedure verschijnt. Indien binnen de bovenvermelde termijn van 10 dagen geen beroep op arbitrage plaatsvindt, kan de debiteur de voorgestelde overeenkomst met de crediteur en vertegenwoordiging sluiten.   
(4).  Een uitspraak van de Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie in een procedure volgens lid (3) van dit Artikel is voor de crediteurenvertegenwoordiging en de debiteur tot op dezelfde hoogte bindend als in de tweede alinea van lid 1 van artikel IX van Bijlage II van deze Overeenkomst is voorzien. Indien een Trustkantoor in overeenstemming met lid (1) of (3) van dit Artikel als partij aan een procedure deelneemt, heeft het in deze procedure dezelfde rechten als iedere andere partij in deze procedure.   

### Artikel  31  

####De Gemengde Commissie voor vraagstukken met betrekking tot Bijlage IV

(1).  De samenstelling en de organisatie van de in artikel 16 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde Gemengde Commissie en de wijze van uitoefening van haar rechtspleging zijn geregeld in het Statuut, hetwelk als Bijlage X aan deze Overeenkomst is toegevoegd.   
(2).  De Gemengde Commissie is bevoegd kennis te nemen van: 

(a) meningsverschillen tussen crediteuren en debiteuren over de uitleg van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst, welke haar worden voorgelegd door de crediteur en de debiteur gezamenlijk of door een crediteur of een debiteur, wiens Regering verklaart, dat de te beoordelen vraag naar haar opvatting van algemene betekenis voor de uitleg van de genoemde Bijlage is;  

(b) gevallen, welke het onderwerp van een procedure voor een volgens artikel 17 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst opgericht scheidsgerecht vormen en in overeenstemming met artikel 16 van de genoemde Bijlage door een Partij bij deze Overeenkomst of door het scheidsgerecht zelf aan de Gemengde Commissie worden voorgelegd op grond van het feit, dat het om een geval van wezenlijke betekenis voor de uitleg van Bijlage IV gaat, met dien verstande, dat in gevallen, welke volgens artikel 11 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst in hoger beroep aan het scheidsgerecht zijn voorgelegd, slechts vragen aan de Gemengde Commissie ter beoordeling mogen worden voorgelegd, welke voor de uitleg van de genoemde Bijlage van wezenlijke betekenis zijn.     
(3).  Elke Partij bij deze Overeenkomst, die belang heeft bij het onderwerp van een procedure voor de Gemengde Commissie, is gerechtigd, als partij aan de procedure deel te nemen.   
(4).  De bevoegdheid van de Gemengde Commissie wordt niet aangetast door het feit, dat een bij het geschil betrokken partij niet bij de voor de Gemengde Commissie aanhangig gemaakte procedure verschijnt.   
(5).  De Gemengde Commissie heeft het recht, zelf in overeenstemming met de voorafgaande bepalingen van dit Artikel over vragen met betrekking tot haar bevoegdheid te beslissen.   
(6).  Onverminderd de bepalingen van lid (7) van dit Artikel is een uitspraak van de Gemengde Commissie definitief en bindend: 

(a) voor de partijen bij de bij haar aanhangige procedure;  

(b) voor elke partij bij een geschil, hetwelk in overeenstemming met het gestelde in lid (2) (*a*) van dit Artikel aan de Gemengde Commissie is voorgelegd;  

(c) voor een Partij bij deze Overeenkomst, die in overeenstemming met het gestelde in lid (2) (*b*) van dit Artikel een geval of een vraag ter beoordeling voorlegt;

Het beroep wordt alleen in behandeling genomen ten aanzien van uit de uitspraak voortvloeiende vragen, met betrekking waartoe de in beroep gaande partij stelt, dat zij van algemene of wezenlijke betekenis zijn. Wanneer door het Tribunaal ten aanzien van de betreffende vraag een beslissing is genomen, dient de Gemengde Commissie in de procedure, welke tot het beroep heeft geleid, alle maatregelen te nemen, welke nodig zijn, om de beslissing van het Tribunaal toe te passen.   

### Artikel  32  

####Scheidsgerecht voor geschillen onder Bijlage IV

(1).  Indien een crediteur en een debiteur in overeenstemming met de vijfde alinea van artikel 17 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst zijn overeengekomen, een geschil aan een scheidsgerecht voor te leggen, dient elk van hen binnen 30 dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum van overeenstemming, een scheidsrechter te benoemen. Indien er meer dan een crediteur of debiteur bij betrokken zijn, wordt de scheidsrechter door de crediteuren of door de debiteuren gezamenlijk benoemd. Indien een partij haar scheidsrechter niet binnen de aangegeven termijn benoemt, is de andere partij bij het geschil gerechtigd, de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel te verzoeken een zodanige scheidsrechter te benoemen. De beide scheidsrechters kiezen binnen 30 dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum van benoeming van de laatstbenoemde scheidsrechter, een derde scheidsrechter als voorzitter. Indien de voorzitter niet binnen deze termijn wordt gekozen, kan elk van beide partijen de benoeming aan de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel verzoeken.   
(2).  

(a) Een crediteur, die in overeenstemming met de tweede alinea van artikel 11 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst bij een scheidsgerecht in hoger beroep gaat, dient binnen 30 dagen, nadat het vonnis van het Duitse gerecht is uitgesproken, 

(I) hiervan kennis te geven aan de Duitse rechtbank, die de uitspraak heeft gedaan;  

(II) de debiteur de naam van de scheidsrechter mee te delen, die hij voor het scheidsgerecht heeft benoemd.    

(b) Na ontvangst van de onder (*a*) (I) van dit lid van dit Artikel bedoelde kennisgeving zijn alle procedures voor Duitse rechterlijke instanties in die zin geëindigd, dat geen rechten uit het vonnis, voorzover dit betrekking heeft op de schuld, welke het onderwerp van het beroep vormt, kunnen worden afgeleid.  

(c) Binnen 30 dagen, gerekend vanaf de datum van ontvangst van de onder (*a*) (II) van dit lid van dit Artikel bedoelde mededeling, dient de debiteur de naam van de scheidsrechter, die hij voor het scheidsgerecht heeft benoemd, aan de crediteur op te geven. Indien de debiteur deze opgave niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn verricht, is de crediteur gerechtigd de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel te verzoeken een zodanige scheidsrechter te benoemen. In overeenstemming met lid (1) van dit Artikel dient een derde scheidsrechter als voorzitter te worden gekozen.  

(d) Een scheidsgerecht, waarvoor een procedure in hoger beroep in overeenstemming met de tweede alinea van artikel 11 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst aanhangig is, 

(I) houdt, voorzover de partijen bij de procedure niet anders overeenkomen, zitting in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland;  

(II) past de beginselen toe, welke uit de eerste alinea van artikel 11 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst voortvloeien;  

(III) behandelt het geschil volledig opnieuw.    

(e) Indien tijdens een procedure, welke in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de tweede alinea van artikel 11 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst voor een scheidsgerecht aanhangig is gemaakt, een vraag aan de Gemengde Commissie wordt voorgelegd in overeenstemming met het gestelde in Artikel 31 lid (2) (*b*) van deze Overeenkomst, schorst het scheidsgerecht aanstonds de procedure, tot een rechtsgeldige uitspraak door de Gemengde Commissie is gedaan. Nadat een dergelijke uitspraak is gedaan, zet het scheidsgerecht de procedure voort en treft de nodige maatregelen, om de uitspraak toe te passen.     
(3).  Indien een scheidsgerecht de uitleg van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst dient te beoordelen, is het aan de daarvoor in aanmerking komende uitspraken van de Gemengde Commissie gebonden.   
(4).  Indien een lid van een scheidsgerecht overlijdt of wegens ziekte, terugtrekking of niet-nakoming van zijn ambtsplichten uitvalt, wordt de functie binnen 30 dagen, nadat zij opengevallen is, op dezelfde wijze als bij de oorspronkelijke benoeming opnieuw vervuld.   
(5).  Het scheidsgerecht kan bepalen, hoe de proceskosten en de kosten wegens advies worden gedragen, en, in een procedure in hoger beroep volgens lid (2) van dit Artikel, welke partij de proceskosten voor het Duitse gerecht dient te dragen of hoe deze tussen de partijen worden verdeeld. Indien het scheidsgerecht geen beslissing over de kosten neemt, draagt iedere partij bij de procedure haar eigen kosten; de kosten van de procedure voor het scheidsgerecht en in voorkomend geval van de procedure voor het Duitse gerecht worden in dit geval voor de helft door de crediteur of de crediteuren en voor de helft door de debiteur of de debiteuren gedragen.   
(6).  Indien een procedure voor het scheidsgerecht aanhangig is, kan deze alleen met toestemming van alle partijen bij deze procedure worden teruggetrokken.   
(7).  Het scheidsgerecht stelt zelf de bij zijn rechtspleging te volgen regels vast met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Artikel en van artikel 17 van Bijlage IV van deze Overeenkomst. Indien dergelijke regels niet zijn vastgesteld of niet toereikend zijn, dienen de door de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel vastgestelde regelingen inzake arbitrage te worden toegepast.   
(8).  De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht is definitief en bindend voor de betrokken partijen.   

### Artikel  33  

####Geschilpunten in verband met de deconcentratie

Het Tribunaal van Arbitrage of een andere, krachtens deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen opgerichte scheidsrechterlijke instantie kunnen geen kennis nemen van aangelegenheden, in welker regeling voorzien is hetzij door een plan, dat is goedgekeurd, of door een beschikking of verordening, die is uitgevaardigd, op grond van de wetten van de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie No. 27 (reorganisatie van de Duitse kolen-, ijzer- en staalindustrie) en No. 35 (deconcentratie van de I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.), door de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie, door een der door haar tot het bewerken van deze soort aangelegenheden gemachtigde diensten, of door enig ander orgaan, dat de bevoegdheden van de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie zal overnemen. Bij elke regeling van deze aard dienen de crediteur en de debiteur, de Geallieerde Autoriteiten en de revisiecommissies de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen toe te passen. Geeft een aangelegenheid aanleiding tot een geschil over de uitleg of de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst of de Bijlagen, dan moet dat geschil, vóór de goedkeuring van een plan, en vóór de uitvaardiging van een beschikking of verordening, die op het geschilpunt betrekking heeft, ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan het Tribunaal of aan de krachtens deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen bevoegde scheidsrechterlijke instantie. De voorgaande bepalingen tasten de bevoegdheid van het Tribunaal en van de andere scheidsrechterlijke instanties, die ingesteld zijn overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen, niet aan ten aanzien van aangelegenheden, die niet uitdrukkelijk geregeld zijn in een goedgekeurd plan of in een uitgevaardigde beschikking of verordening, zoals hierboven bedoeld, of van aangelegenheden, die zich voordoen tengevolge van na het van kracht worden van dat plan, die beschikking of verordening optredende gebeurtenissen.

Er zal deugdelijk rekening worden gehouden met de beginselen waardoor de Conferentie over de Duitse buitenlandse schulden zich heeft laten leiden, met de door haar beoogde doelstellingen, en met de toezegging van de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland om alles te zullen doen, wat in haar vermogen is, teneinde de nakoming van haar verplichtingen te verzekeren. Indien de voornaamste Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst, die aan het overleg deelnemen, daartoe besluiten, kan het advies worden gevraagd van de daarvoor in aanmerking komende internationale organisaties of van andere onafhankelijke deskundigen.

### BIJLAGE  I  

####Overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor de regeling van Rijksschulden en schulden van andere publiekrechtelijke lichamen

###A. *Rijksschulden*

De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland (hierna genoemd Bondsregering) zal aan de houders van obligaties aanbieden de volgende bedragen te betalen en over te maken: 

1.  *De 7 % buitenlandse (Dawes-)lening van 1924*  

(a) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1953 een rente van 5½ % per jaar voor de Amerikaanse tranche en 5 % per jaar voor de andere tranches.  

(b) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 3 % voor de Amerikaanse tranche en van 2 % voor de andere tranches bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd; het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetaling tezamen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit.  

(c) De vervaltermijn van de lening wordt verschoven tot het jaar 1969.  

(d) Verschuldigde achterstallige renten zullen tegen 5 % opnieuw worden berekend zonder samengestelde interest; de Bondsregering zal voor het aldus berekende totaalbedrag obligaties uitgeven met een looptijd van 20 jaar, die een rente geven van 3 % per jaar en na 5 jaar met 2 % per jaar geamortiseerd worden. Op obligaties voor achterstallige renten, die verschuldigd waren tot 31 December 1944, zullen vanaf 15 April 1953 betalingen worden gedaan. Obligaties voor het resterende bedrag zullen niet worden uitgegeven voor de hereniging van Duitsland heeft plaatsgevonden; op dit tijdstip zullen de betalingen op deze obligaties een aanvang nemen.  

(e) Overigens blijven de bepalingen van de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten van de lening van kracht.  

(f) Alle kosten voortvloeiende uit de uitvoering van de bovenbedoelde wijzigingen in de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten zijn voor rekening van de Bondsregering.    

2.  *De 5½ % internationale (Young-)lening van 1930*  

(a) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1953 een rente van 5 % per jaar voor de Amerikaanse tranche en 4½ % per jaar voor de andere tranches.  

(b) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 1 % bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd; het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetaling tezamen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit.  

(c) De vervaltermijn van de lening wordt verschoven tot het jaar 1980.  

(d) Verschuldigde achterstallige renten zullen tegen 4½ % opnieuw worden berekend zonder samengestelde interest; de Bondsregering zal voor het aldus berekende totaalbedrag obligaties uitgeven met een looptijd van 20 jaar, die een rente geven van 3 % per jaar en na 5 jaar met 1 % per jaar geamortiseerd worden. Op obligaties voor achterstallige renten, die verschuldigd waren tot 31 December 1944, zal op 1 Juni 1953 betaling plaatsvinden van de eerste coupon over 6 maanden rente. Obligaties voor het resterende bedrag zullen niet worden uitgegeven voor de hereniging van Duitsland heeft plaatsgevonden; op dit tijdstip zullen de betalingen op deze obligaties een aanvang nemen.  

(e) De bedragen, verschuldigd op de verschillende tranches van de 5½ % internationale lening van 1930 zijn alleen betaalbaar in de valuta van het land van uitgifte. In verband met de tegenwoordige economische en financiële toestand in Duitsland is overeengekomen, dat als grondslag voor de berekening van dit bedrag in vreemde valuta zal dienen het bedrag in dollars, waarmede de betaling, verschuldigd in de valuta van het land van uitgifte in overeenstemming zou zijn geweest, omgerekend volgens de wisselkoers geldend op het tijdstip van de uitgifte van de lening. Het op deze wijze verkregen nominale bedrag in U.S.-dollars wordt dan weer omgerekend in de desbetreffende valuta's tegen de wisselkoers van 1 Augustus 1952. Zou de wisselkoers geldend op 1 Augustus 1952 zich voor een van de valuta's van uitgifte later wijzigen met 5 % of meer, dan moeten de termijnen verschuldigd na dit tijdstip weliswaar evenals tevoren in de valuta van het land van uitgifte worden betaald, doch zij moeten worden berekend op basis van de minst gedeprecieerde valuta (in verhouding tot de wisselkoers van 1 Augustus 1952) en weer omgerekend worden in de valuta van uitgifte tegen de wisselkoers geldend op het tijdstip, waarop de desbetreffende betaling verschuldigd is.  

(f) Overigens blijven de bepalingen van de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst van de lening van kracht.  

(g) Alle kosten voortvloeiende uit de uitvoering van de bovenbedoelde wijzigingen in de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten zijn voor rekening van de Bondsregering.    

3.  *De 6 % buitenlandse (Lucifers-)lening van 1930*  

(a) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1953 een rente van 4 % per jaar.  

(b) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 4 % bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd; het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetaling tezamen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit.  

(c) Achterstallige renten zullen tegen 4 % opnieuw worden berekend zonder samengestelde interest, maar overigens worden zij op dezelfde wijze behandeld als de achterstallige renten van de Young-lening.  

(d) De vervaltermijn van de lening wordt verschoven tot het jaar 1994.  

(e) Zolang de dienst van de Lucifers-lening volgens de bepalingen van deze regeling plaatsvindt, worden de renten en amortisatiebedragen van de lening betaald bij de Skandinaviska Banken in Stockholm, Zweden, en wel in Zweedse kronen tot de tegenwaarde van het in U.S.-dollars verschuldigde bedrag tegen de wisselkoers, geldend op de vervaldag.  

(f) Overigens wordt, afgezien van de garanties, de Luciferslening op dezelfde wijze behandeld als de Young-lening.    

4.  *Obligaties van de Konversionskasse*  Ten aanzien van obligaties en scrips van de Konversionskasse zal de Bondsregering zich tot de volgende betalingen verplichten: 

(a) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon of rente, betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1953, een rente volgens de oorspronkelijke bepaling van de overeenkomst;  

(b) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 2 % bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd; het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetaling tezamen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit;  

(c) De vervaltermijnen van deze obligaties zullen, gerekend vanaf de bestaande vervaltermijnen, 17 jaar worden verschoven;  

(d) Twee derden van de achterstallige renten berekend volgens de contractuele rentevoet zullen worden geschrapt. Het overblijvende derde deel wordt geconsolideerd; het zal dezelfde rente dragen en geamortiseerd worden op dezelfde wijze als de oorspronkelijke obligaties;  

(e) Overigens blijven de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten ten aanzien van deze obligaties van kracht;  

(f) Alle kosten voortvloeiende uit de uitvoering van de bovenbedoelde wijzigingen in de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten zijn voor rekening van de Bondsregering;  

(g) Obligaties en scrips luidende in RM worden in de verhouding 10 : 1 in Duitse mark omgezet.    

5. Over bepaalde kleine verplichtingen in vreemde valuta van de Reichsbahn en de Reichspost zullen, voorzover zij niet in Bijlage IV behandeld zijn, onderhandelingen worden gevoerd tussen de Bondsregering en de crediteuren.  

6.  *Rijksmark-schulden van het Rijk, de Reichsbahn, de Reichspost en de Staat Pruisen*  Overeenkomstig de wens van de vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren zal de Bondsregering zich verplichten: 

(a) Buitenlandse crediteuren op hun verzoek en met toepassing van het beginsel van nationale behandeling de voordelen en vergoedingen toe te staan, die aan Duitse crediteuren in verband met de munthervorming zijn toegekend of in de toekomst mochten worden toegekend;  

(b) Buitenlandse crediteuren bij de uitvaardiging in de toekomst van een Duitse wet met betrekking tot de omzetting en regeling van schulden de voordeligste regeling toe te staan, welke volgens deze wet voor Duitse crediteuren mogelijk is;  

(c) Voor het geval de onder *(b)* bedoelde wet niet voor 1 Januari 1954 wordt afgekondigd of geen betrekking heeft op alle categorieën van schulden, voor 1 April 1954 in onderhandeling te treden met de buitenlandse vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren. Deze behouden zich het recht voor bij bedoelde onderhandelingen een bijzondere regeling te verlangen. Deze verplichting geldt voor alle RM-schulden van het Rijk, de Reichsbahn en de Reichspost, onverschillig of zij al dan niet in obligaties (Schatkistbiljetten, obligaties van de „Ablösungsanleihen”, enz.) zijn belichaamd.  

(d) De Bondsregering verplicht zich verder op gelijke wijze te handelen ten aanzien van de toekomstige dienst der RM-schulden van de Staat Pruisen.     
###B. *Buitenlandse obligaties, uitgegeven of gegarandeerd door de „Länder”, gemeenten e.d. publiekrechtelijke lichamen in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland.*

7. De debiteuren moeten de volgende bedragen betalen, welke door de Bondsregering zullen worden getransfereerd: 

(1)  *Obligaties met uitzondering van die, uitgegeven door de Staat Pruisen:*  

(a) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1953: 75 % van de oorspronkelijk overeengekomen rente (met een minimum van 4 % per jaar en een maximum van 5¼ % per jaar) of de in de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst vastgelegde rente indien deze minder dan 4 % per jaar is.  

(b) Rente op dezelfde voet over 2/3 van de achterstallige rente (voorzover niet reeds gedekt door obligaties van de Konversionskasse of op grond van soortgelijke overeengekomen regelingen). Deze achterstallige bedragen zullen geconsolideerd worden.  

(c) Te beginnen met de vervaldag van de eerste coupon betaalbaar na 31 Maart 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 1 % bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd, welk bedrag op 31 Maart 1963 tot 2 % wordt verhoogd voor leningen die in 1968 of later vervallen; het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetalingen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit.  

(d) De vervaltermijnen van deze leningen zullen, gerekend vanaf de bestaande vervaltermijnen, 20 jaar worden verschoven.  

(e) Overigens blijven de bepalingen van de oorspronkelijke leningsovereenkomsten van kracht, tenzij de crediteur in bijzondere gevallen in een andere regeling heeft toegestemd. Doen zich voor een debiteur bijzondere omstandigheden voor, tengevolge waarvan, naar de overtuiging van de vertegenwoordigers der crediteuren van de debiteur niet gevergd kan worden zich aan de algemene regeling te houden, dan zullen de debiteur en de vertegenwoordigers van de crediteuren de naar hun mening noodzakelijke aanpassingen overeenkomen.  

(f) Obligaties luidende in RM, uitgegeven en betaalbaar buiten het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, worden in de verhouding 10:1 in Duitse mark omgezet. Zij zullen rente dragen volgens de oorspronkelijk overeengekomen rentevoet. Achterstallige renten zullen worden geconsolideerd op dezelfde basis en zullen gelijke rente dragen. De looptijd van de obligaties zal met 15 jaar, gerekend vanaf de vervaltermijn, worden verlengd; deze obligaties zullen worden afgelost in gelijke jaarlijkse amortisatietermijnen, waarvan de eerste betaalbaar zal zijn op de vervaldag van de eerste coupon in het jaar 1958. Renten en amortisatiebedragen worden getransfereerd in de valuta van het land, waar de obligatiehouder woonachtig is.  

(g) De begrippen „oorspronkelijke overeenkomst” en „oorspronkelijk overeengekomen renten” duiden aan de overeenkomst of de overeengekomen renten, welke tussen de debiteur en de crediteur golden op het tijdstip, waarop oorspronkelijk de lening werd opgenomen of de verplichting werd aangegaan, tenzij een conversie (hierna genoemd „echte conversie”) voor 9 Juni 1933 heeft plaats gevonden dan wel op deze datum of daarna is geschied wegens bestaande of dreigende insolventie van de debiteur, dan wel als gevolg van vrije onderhandelingen; hierbij geldt het volgende: 

(i) Bij meningsverschillen beslist een scheidsgerecht, waarbij de debiteur moet bewijzen, dat de overeenkomst door vrije onderhandelingen is tot stand gekomen.  

(ii) Regelingen, waarbij de Duitse Treuhänder voor vijandelijk vermogen of een persoon, benoemd door de Duitse overheid in een bezet gebied de crediteur heeft vertegenwoordigd, of die uitsluitend berustten op aanvaarding door de crediteur van een door de debiteur gedaan eenzijdig aanbod, worden geacht niet door vrije onderhandelingen tot stand te zijn gekomen.   Bij de berekening van toekomstige renten en achterstallige renten volgens deze algemene formule wordt uitgegaan van de oorspronkelijk overeengekomen rentevoet. Indien echter een echte conversie heeft plaatsgevonden, moet uitgegaan worden van de geconverteerde rentevoet onder voorwaarde dat de geconverteerde rentevoet noch voor de berekening van achterstallige renten noch voor die van toekomstige renten enige verlaging zal ondergaan; de debiteur kan echter ook de voorkeur geven aan een berekening volgens de oorspronkelijk overeengekomen rentevoet volgens de algemene formule.  

(h) Alle kosten voortvloeiende uit de uitvoering van bovenbedoelde wijzigingen in de oorspronkelijke overeenkomsten zijn voor rekening van de debiteuren.  

(i) Wanneer het resterende kapitaalbedrag van alle in buitenlandse valuta uitgegeven obligaties van een bepaalde debiteur gering is, kan de debiteur een vroegere terugbetaling en een definitieve regeling van het totale verschuldigde bedrag en de achterstallige renten aanbieden zonder inachtneming van het bepaalde onder (*d*) hierboven met betrekking tot de verlenging van de vervaltermijn van de lening.  

(j) Verplichtingen van rechtspersonen, gegarandeerd door een land, een stad, een gemeente of een ander openbaar lichaam, worden geregeld volgens de „overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor de regeling van Duitse schulden met middellange en lange looptijduit particuliere kapitaaltransacties” (Bijlage II), mits deze garanties verder van kracht blijven volgens de in de aanbevelingen vervatte bepalingen (zie ook Bijlage VII).    

(2)  *Obligaties van de Staat Pruisen*  De Bondsregering zal voor rekening van die Länder, welke het gebied en de vermogenswaarden van de vroegere Staat Pruisen hebben overgenomen, de volgende betalingen doen: 

(a) De 6½ % Pruisische buitenlandse lening in U.S.-dollars van 15 September 1926, vervallende 15 September 1951, en de 6 % Pruisische buitenlandse lening in U.S.-dollars van 15 October 1927, vervaldag 15 October 1952: 

(i) De Bondsregering geeft nieuwe, in dollars luidende obligaties uit, waarvan de eerste coupon is gedateerd 1 April 1953. Zij worden uitgegeven met een looptijd van 20 jaar in dezelfde coupures als de nog uitstaande obligaties van hogergenoemde leningen en dragen een rente van 4 %, betaalbaar halfjaarlijks op 1 April en 1 October. Vanaf 1 April 1958 wordt jaarlijks een amortisatiebedrag van 1 % bij deze rentebetalingen gevoegd. Het amortisatiebedrag vormt met de rentebetalingen tezamen een vaste cumulatieve annuïteit; de debiteur kan de amortisatie doen plaatsvinden hetzij door uitloting a pari, hetzij door obligaties op de beurs of op andere wijze te kopen; hij kan ook een aanvullende amortisatie doen plaatsvinden, zolang de dienst overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de overeenkomst plaatsvindt;  

(ii) De nog uitstaande coupons van de oude obligaties met vervaldagen van 15 Maart 1933 tot 31 December 1936 zullen met 20 jaar worden verlengd en 50 % van het bedrag daarvan zal worden betaald in U.S.-dollars op de overeenkomstige data in de jaren 1953, 1954, 1955 en 1956;  

(iii) Coupons, vervallend op 1 Januari 1937 of later zullen niet worden betaald totdat de gebiedsdelen, die vroeger tot de Staat Pruisen behoorden en tegenwoordig buiten het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek liggen, met de Bondsrepubliek zijn herenigd; alsdan zal over de regeling van deze verplichtingen worden onderhandeld;  

(iv) Alle kosten voortvloeiende uit de uitvoering van bovenbedoelde bepalingen zijn voor rekening van de Bondsregering.    

(b) De 4½ % lening van de Staat Lübeck in Zweedse kronen van 1923 (in 1938 door de Staat Pruisen overgenomen): De nog uitstaande obligaties van deze lening, waarvan de terugbetaling tegen 1 Mei/1 November 1944 was aangekondigd, zullen bij aanbieding met een korting van 50 % op het nominale bedrag tegen de dagkoers, en zonder betaling van achterstallige renten, worden afgelost.    

(3) *Niet in obligaties belichaamde schulden* (voorzover niet in Bijlage IV behandeld) De bepalingen van punt 7 (1) zijn mutatis mutandis van toepassing, waarbij de dienst begint op 1 Januari 1953. Bij de regeling van vorderingen in marken zal rekening worden gehouden met de overeenkomstige bepalingen van Bijlage IV.     
###C. *Algemene bepalingen*

8.  *Procedure voor de tenuitvoerlegging van deze voorstellen*  

(a) De voorwaarden van de regeling kunnen op de bestaande obligaties gedrukt worden, of er kunnen tegen inlevering van de bestaande obligaties nieuwe obligaties en voor achterstallige renten nieuwe obligaties of scrips worden uitgegeven, al naar gelang dit op de verschillende markten, waar de obligaties oorspronkelijk werden uitgegeven, gebruikelijk en mogelijk is. Zulke obligaties met opdruk of zulke nieuwe obligaties moeten in overeenstemming zijn met de bestaande marktgebruiken. De debiteur moet op eigen kosten de daarvoor geschikte bankinstellingen opdracht geven de details van het voorstel uit te voeren en moet aan alle voorschriften van regeringsinstanties en effectenmarkten voldoen, teneinde de maximum-verhandelbaarheid aan de obligaties te verlenen. 
### *Voorwaarden van het aanbod* 

(b) Het aanbod wordt in de verschillende landen in overleg met de verenigingen van obligatiehouders of soortgelijke organisaties gedaan en blijft gedurende minstens 5 jaar voor de houders van obligaties van kracht. Wanneer daarvoor gegronde redenen zijn, moeten de debiteuren het aanbod verder verlengen. 
### *Voorbehoud van rechten* 

(c) Indien een debiteur de verplichtingen die hij volgens deze regeling op zich neemt, niet nakomt, zijn de crediteuren gerechtigd hun rechten uit de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst geldend te maken. 
### *Onkosten van betaalkantoren en trustees* 

(d) Commissies en onkosten welke ontstaan voor de betaalkantoren zullen, evenals honoraria en onkosten van de trustees, worden betaald en getransfereerd. 
### *Andere uitgaven* 

(e) De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren behouden zich het recht voor om van de onderscheidene debiteuren vergoeding te eisen van alle uitgaven, welke door hen zijn gedaan in verband met de conferentie te Londen; een aanbod door een debiteur gedaan op grond van deze regeling wordt beschouwd als een aanvaarding van deze bepaling door de betrokken debiteur. Geen enkele bepaling van deze regeling sluit uit, dat een vertegenwoordiger van crediteuren van de obligatiehouders of crediteuren betaling kan verlangen van aanvullende kosten, die in overeenstemming zijn met de bestaande gebruiken of op andere gronden redelijk voorkomen. 
### *Certificatie van effecten* 

(f) De Bondsregering verplicht zich alles wat in haar vermogen ligt te doen, om op grond van het door het Parlement aangenomen en binnenkort in werking tredende „Auslandsbonds-Bereinigungsgesetz” aan een systeem, geëigend voor de certificatie van Duitse buitenlandse obligaties, in de verschillende crediteurlanden zo spoedig mogelijk, doch uiterlijk op 1 Februari 1953, uitvoering te geven. Betalingen op obligaties of coupons, welke volgens de Duitse certificatievoorschriften aan certificatie onderworpen zijn, mogen eerst dan plaatsvinden, wanneer deze obligaties of coupons zijn gecertificeerd.    

9. De betrokken verenigingen van obligatiehouders of soortgelijke organisaties zullen hun leden adviseren deze bepalingen aan te nemen.   
###D. *Vorderingen op grond van beslissingen van gemengde scheidsgerechten*

10.  *Obligaties, uitgegeven op grond van beslissingen van de gemengde Duits-Amerikaanse commissie*  De Duitse delegatie voor de buitenlandse schulden enerzijds en de vertegenwoordigers van de commissie van Amerikaanse houders van in obligaties vervatte aanspraken op grond van beslissingen van de Duits-Amerikaanse gemengde commissie anderzijds, zijn het volgende overeengekomen: De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de Regering van de Verenigde Staten voorstellen, en de commissie van houders van aanspraken op grond van beslissingen van de Duits-Amerikaanse gemengde commissie zal de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de individuele houders van aanspraken op grond van deze beslissingen, aanbevelen, de verplichting van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland tegenover de Verenigde Staten ten behoeve van die Amerikaanse onderdanen, te wier gunste door Duitsland in het jaar 1939 de thans noodlijdende obligaties werden uitgegeven, op de volgende voorwaarden te regelen: 

(1) De Bondsrepubliek Duitsland betaalt op 1 April 1953 en op 1 April van elk daaropvolgend jaar de volgende bedragen:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| --- | $  |
| In de eerste 5 jaar telkens ..........  | 3.000.000  |
| In de daaropvolgende 5 jaar telkens ....  | 3.700.000  |
| In de daaropvolgende 16 jaar telkens ...  | 4.000.000  |

De betaling zal worden gedaan in Amerikaanse dollars aan de Verenigde Staten ter verdeling onder de houders van aanspraken op grond van beslissingen van de Duits-Amerikaanse gemengde commissie.  

(2) Indien de Bondsrepubliek met de betaling van een jaarlijkse termijn op de vervaldag in gebreke blijft, wordt over deze termijn vanaf de vervaldag tot de dag van betaling een rente van 3¾ % per jaar voldaan.  

(3) Ten bewijze van de verplichtingen van de Bondsrepubliek worden in dollars luidende obligaties, die tot de bedoelde bedragen en op de genoemde data vervallen, uitgegeven; op het tijdstip van de uitgifte wordt een overeenkomstig aantal oude obligaties geannuleerd en aan de Bondsrepubliek teruggegeven.  

(4) De voorwaarden van de regeling zullen worden vervat in een bilaterale overeenkomst tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de Verenigde Staten.  

(5) De integrale tenuitvoerlegging van deze overeenkomst door deze of een volgende Regering van de Bondsrepubliek, wordt, evenals de betaling van de op grond van deze overeenkomst verschuldigde bedragen, beschouwd als een nakomen door en volledige bevrijding van deze of een volgende Regering van de Bondsrepubliek, ten aanzien van de verplichtingen op grond van de overeenkomst van 23 Juni 1930 en van de obligaties, welke op grond van deze overeenkomst zijn uitgegeven in verband met de beslissingen van de Duits-Amerikaanse gemengde commissie, gekomen ten gunste van onderdanen van de Verenigde Staten; zulks ondanks andersluidende bepalingen in de briefwisseling van 23 October 1950 en 6 Maart 1951 tussen de Bondskanselier en de Geallieerde Hoge Commissarissen voor Duitsland of in het door de Drie Mogendheden Commissie opgestelde memorandum van December 1951.    

11.  *Vorderingen op grond van beslissingen van het Duits-Griekse scheidsgerecht*  Tussen de Griekse en Duitse delegaties heeft een voorlopige gedachtenwisseling plaatsgevonden over de vorderingen van privé-personen op grond van beslissingen van het na de eerste wereldoorlog ingestelde Duits-Griekse scheidsgerecht. Verdere besprekingen zullen volgen. Het resultaat hiervan zal, indien het wordt goedgekeurd, worden opgenomen in de intergouvernementele overeenkomst.   
###E. *Diversen*

De volgende regelingen worden aanbevolen: 

12.  *Het Lee Higginson-crediet*  

(a) De deelnemers krijgen nieuwe schuldbekentenissen van de Bondsrepubliek met een looptijd van 2 jaar over de volle hoofdsom van hun deelnamen. (Schuldbekentenissen met een looptijd van 2 jaar, omdat de oorspronkelijke looptijd van het crediet, toen het in het jaar 1930 werd gegeven, 2 jaar bedroeg.)  

(b) Geen achterstallige rente.  

(c) Geen goud-clausule.  

(d) De nieuwe schuldbekentenissen dragen vanaf de dag van inwerkingtreding van de overeenkomst een rente van 31 % per jaar, welke rente maandelijks vooruit betaalbaar is.  

(e) Het garantiefonds wordt hersteld in de vorm van een tegoed in Duitse mark bij de Bank Deutscher Lander ten name van de Duitse administratie van de schulden der Bondsregering als gevolmachtigde; dit fonds moet zo worden berekend, dat het in Duitse mark gelijk is aan de waarde van de schuldbekentenissen omgerekend tegen de officiële wisselkoers; de Bondsregering zal dit fonds opbouwen in 24 gelijke maandelijkse termijnen vanaf het tijdstip van de uitgifte der schuldbekentenissen.  

(f) De deelnemers hebben steeds het recht, wanneer zij daartoe de wens te kennen geven, vooruitbetaling van het totale bedrag of van een gedeelte van hun schuldbekentenissen te ontvangen in Duitse mark, omgerekend volgens de officiële wisselkoers. Deze vooruitbetalingen zullen, pro tanto, als volledige kwijting van de in dollars of sterling luidende verplichting gelden; een dergelijke betaling dient te worden gedaan, wanneer de deelnemers dit wensen, zodra de Duitse wetten en verordeningen het mogelijk maken. Deze betalingen dienen telkens te worden gedaan uit het garantiefonds, voorzover het evenredige aandeel van de deelnemers in dit fonds zulks toelaat, en het saldo dient rechtstreeks door de Bondsregering in Duitse mark te worden betaald.    

13.  *Credieten van de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen*  

(a) De Bondsregering betaalt vanaf 1 Januari 1953 met betrekking tot de lopende rente op de vorderingen van de bank een jaarlijks bedrag van 5.600.000 Zwitserse francs.  

(b) Gezien de betaling van deze annuïteiten heeft de Bank zich bereid verklaard haar credieten op het tegenwoordige peil te handhaven tot 31 Maart 1966. Zij heeft zich verder bereid verklaard de regeling van achterstallige renten tot dit tijdstip uit te stellen. De volledige tekst van deze overeenkomst is afgedrukt als Bijlage I *a.*    

14.  *Stortingen bij de Konversionskasse*  

(a) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is bereid de verplichting over te nemen voor de volledige betaling in de verschuldigde valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren van die bedragen, die door debiteuren in het Saargebied bij de Konversionskasse zijn gestort, voorzover de buitenlandse crediteuren geen betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(b) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is bereid de verplichting over te nemen van de betaling in de verschillende valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren van 60 % van die bedragen, die door debiteuren in Oostenrijk, Frankrijk, België en Luxemburg bij de Konversionskasse zijn gestort, voorzover de buitenlandse crediteuren geen betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen, noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(c) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal met de vertegenwoordigers van de buitenlandse crediteuren voor eind December 1952 onderhandelingen beginnen met betrekking tot de uitvoering van deze verplichtingen.    

15.  *Aansprakelijkheid voor schulden van de Oostenrijkse Regering*   

De crediteuren zijn er niet in geslaagd deze kwestie te regelen; binnenkort zal hierover verder worden onderhandeld.  

16. *Overeenkomst tussen België en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland* (zie Bijlage I *b*). Het ontwerp voor een overeenkomst tussen België en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is op 4 Augustus 1952 tot stand gekomen.

4. Onder voorbehoud van de voorgaande bepalingen zal door de onderhavige overgangsregeling de bestaande rechtstoestand op generlei wijze worden gewijzigd; met name zullen daardoor de rechten en de verplichtingen van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland met betrekking tot de investeringen van de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen in Duitsland niet worden uitgebreid.  

5. Met het oog op de in lid 1 bedoelde betalingen zal de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen niet de terugbetaling verlangen van de hoofdsommen harer investeringen in Duitsland, noch de betaling van achterstallige rente, vóór 1 April 1966.

####Gemeenschappelijke verklaring inzake de omrekening en de afwikkeling van buitenlandse goudmarkleningen van Duitse gemeenten

Aan de Voorzitter van de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse buitenlandse schulden 29, Chesham Place Londen S.W. 1.  *Londen, 19 November 1952.*  Mijnheer de Voorzitter, Wij hebben de eer U te berichten dat de Duitse delegatie voor de buitenlandse schulden en het British Committee of Long-Term and Medium-Term Creditors of Germany als volgt zijn overeengekomen met betrekking tot de omrekening en de afwikkeling van buitenlandse goudmarkleningen van Duitse gemeenten: 

1. Overeengekomen is dat de in punt 7 (1) (*f*) van bijlage 3 bij het rapport van de conferentie bedoelde omrekening en afwikkeling van de dienst der in het buitenland uitgegeven en betaalbare RM-obligaties geen betrekking zullen hebben op buitenlandse goudmarkleningen of met een goud-clausule voorziene RM-leningen van Duitse gemeenten in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek.  

2. Er bestaat overeenstemming over het beginsel dat die obligaties, die behoren tot goudmarkleningen of van een goud-clausule voorziene RM-leningen van Duitse gemeenten in het gebied der Bondsrepubliek, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen, in de verhouding van één goudmark of één RM met goud-clausule = één DM in DM zullen worden omgezet. De vaststelling van de criteria ter bepaling van een specifiek buitenlands karakter van dergelijke obligaties zal geschieden in overeenstemming met de regels, die het gevolg kunnen zijn van de besprekingen voorzien in het voorbehoud, vervat in artikel V, lid 3 van bijlage 4 en in artikel 6 van bijlage 6 bij het rapport van de conferentie.  

3. De verplichtingen van Duitse gemeenten in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek, voortvloeiende uit die obligaties, behorende tot goudmarkleningen of van een goud-clausule voorziene RM-leningen, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen, zullen geregeld worden overeenkomstig de aanbevelingen, die in punt 7 lid (1) (*a*) tot (*e*) en (*g*) tot (*j*) van bijlage 3 bij het rapport van de conferentie met betrekking tot de door de Länder, gemeenten en soortgelijke publiekrechtelijke lichamen in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek uitgegeven of gegarandeerde buitenlandse obligaties zijn vastgelegd.   Wij verzoeken U accoord te gaan met de hierboven omschreven overeenkomst, en deze brief als bijlage bij Bijlage I van de Schuldenovereenkomst te voegen. Met de meeste hoogachting enz. (w.g.)

Zou de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland er niet in slagen voor 1 Juli 1953 een volledig overzicht te verkrijgen over het totaal te amortiseren bedrag, dan kan zij ten hoogste 6 maanden later met de betalingen een aanvang maken. Met het oog op de vaststelling van het totaalbedrag der in aanmerking komende verplichtingen zal de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland de crediteuren en de debiteuren bij officiële bekendmaking uitnodigen, de nog niet betaalde vorderingen evenals de eventueel destijds bij de Konversionskasse verrichte stortingen aan te melden bij de „Konversionskasse für Deutsche Auslandsschulden”, en de met betrekking daartoe beschikbare bewijsstukken aan de Konversionskasse over te leggen. De „Konversionskasse für Deutsche Auslandsschulden” te Berlijn zal opdracht ontvangen de desbetreffende verplichtingen te registreren. 
###III. Kleine bedragen

De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland kan naar haar goedvinden in effecten belichaamde schulden of andere schulden, welke een gering bedrag uitmaken, in kortere tijd betalen. U zoudt mij verplichten door mij te willen bevestigen, dat bovenstaand voorstel een juist beeld geeft van de door ons bereikte overeenstemming en dus als inhoud kan gelden van de voorgenomen briefwisseling.

### Artikel  I  

####Inleiding

In deze aanbevelingen zijn de bepalingen en de procedure neergelegd, welke zullen gelden voor de regeling van de in artikel III hieronder bedoelde schulden. De aanbevelingen brengen geen wijziging in de voorwaarden van de schulden die hier bedoeld worden; in tegendeel, het ligt in de bedoeling dat tussen elke debiteur en zijn crediteuren nieuwe overeenkomsten volgens deze aanbevelingen zullen worden gesloten. In de nieuwe overeenkomsten blijven de bepalingen van de bestaande overeenkomsten gehandhaafd, voorzover zij niet worden gewijzigd volgens tussen crediteuren en debiteur gemaakte afspraken binnen het kader van deze aanbevelingen.  

### Artikel  II  

####Definities

De volgende in deze aanbevelingen genoemde begrippen hebben, tenzij de samenhang een andere interpretatie vereist, de hierna genoemde betekenis: 

Oorspronkelijke overeenkomst - de overeenkomst gesloten op het tijdstip waarop de lening is aangegaan.  

Bestaande overeenkomst - de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst, tenzij deze het voorwerp is geweest van een echte conversie of meerdere echte conversies; alsdan wordt met bestaande overeenkomst bedoeld de overeenkomst, welke het resultaat is geweest van de laatste echte conversie.  

Echte conversie - een wijziging, aangebracht in de bepalingen van de lening-overeenkomst voor 9 Juni 1933; of een wijziging, die op dat tijdstip of daarna wegens insolventie of dreigende insolventie van de debiteur, dan wel als gevolg van vrije onderhandelingen heeft plaatsgevonden. 

(a) Bij meningsverschillen over de vraag, of een wijziging als gevolg van vrije onderhandelingen tot stand is gekomen, moet worden aangenomen dat een afspraak, waarbij de Duitse Treuhänder voor vijandelijke vermogens de crediteur heeft vertegenwoordigd, of die uitsluitend is voortgekomen uit het aannemen door de crediteur van een door de debiteur gedaan eenzijdig aanbod, niet als een gevolg van vrije onderhandelingen tot stand is gekomen.  

(b) Steeds moet bij verschil van mening een debiteur bewijzen dat de conversie een echte conversie was.  

(c) Bij kerkelijke leningen wordt elke conversie als een echte conversie beschouwd.    

Crediteuren - dit begrip omvat ook vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren, die volgens artikel VIII van deze overeenkomst zijn benoemd.  

Duitsland - het gehele gebied vallende binnen het Duitse Rijk op 1 Januari 1937.  

Gevestigd in - gewoonlijk verblijvende of de zetel hebbende in; een rechtspersoon heeft haar zetel in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of in Berlijn (West) wanneer zij in het handelsregister van het desbetreffende gebied is ingeschreven.    

### Artikel  III  

####Onder deze Overeenkomst vallende schulden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op alle buiten Duitsland uitgegeven leningen of opgenomen credieten indien: 

(a) de lening of het crediet voor 8 Mei 1945 werd verstrekt; en  

(b) de lening of het crediet volgens de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst voor minstens 5 jaar werd verstrekt; en  

(c) de debiteur een vereniging naar burgerlijk- of handelsrecht is, een rechtspersoon, een bond, een firma, bank, weldadigheidsinstelling, een andere niet-openbare instelling of een kerkelijke organisatie; en  

(d) de debiteur op 1 Januari 1953 of op een later tijdstip, waarop zijn crediteuren een voorstel voor een regeling verlangen, in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of in Berlijn (West) gevestigd is; en  

(e) de lening of het crediet luidt in een andere als Duitse valuta of in Duitse valuta met een deviezen- of goud-clausule.     
2.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van lid 1 van dit artikel wordt deze Overeenkomst niet toegepast op: 

(i) de volgende categorieën van schulden, welke een afzonderlijke behandeling vereisen: 

(a) schulden van openbare nutsbedrijven gelegen in het gebied van en gecontroleerd door de stad Berlijn;  

(b) schulden aan een of meerdere personen, die direct of indirect eigendomsrechten hebben op de debiteur;  

(c) schulden met betrekking tot leningen, waarvan het oorspronkelijke bedrag volgens de op 1 Juli 1952 geldende wisselkoers minder dan U.S.-$ 40.000 heeft bedragen;  

(d) schulden uit de Zwitsers-Duitse overeenkomsten van 6 December 1920 en 25 Maart 1923 (de zgn. „Frankengrundschulden”);    

(ii) de schulden van de Duits-Zwitserse op de grens gelegen krachtstations. Er zijn 3 leningen in obligaties en 2 andere leningen, ten aanzien waarvan Duitse maatschappijen de debiteur zijn van Zwitserse obligatiehouders en andere crediteuren. Ten gevolge van bijzondere omstandigheden, welke samenhangen met de exploitatie van gemeenschappelijke krachtstations langs de Rijn, hangt de regeling van deze verplichtingen samen met de regeling van andere aangelegenheden. Gezien deze omstandigheden wordt de definitieve regeling (welke op het ogenblik nog niet kan worden getroffen) overgelaten aan rechtstreekse onderhandelingen tussen Zwitserland en de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland. De Crediteuren verklaren echter reeds thans dat zij bij de definitieve regeling voor de eerste 5 jaar na 1 Januari 1953 geen betaling zullen verlangen van een jaarlijks bedrag, dat de som van 5.000.000 Zwitserse francs te boven gaat.     
3.  Geen schuld mag uitgesloten worden uitsluitend omdat een nieuwe debiteur de aansprakelijkheid daarvoor overneemt of overgenomen heeft op grond van een wet of op andere wijze voor of na 8 Mei 1945; zo mag geen schuld van een onderneming, welke valt onder de wet No. 27 van de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie „Reorganisatie van de Duitse kolen-, ijzer- en staalindustrie”, uitgesloten worden wegens overneming door een nieuwe onderneming of een andere onderneming die de oorspronkelijke is opgevolgd.   
4.  Deze Overeenkomst wordt niet toegepast op obligaties of coupons, die moeten worden gecertificeerd op grond van de Duitse wet op de certificatie van effecten van 19 Augustus 1949 (Wirtschaftsgesetzblatt S 295) en de wet op de certificatie van Duitse buitenlandse obligaties van Augustus 1952, zolang deze obligaties of coupons niet zijn gecertificeerd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van die wetten of van bilaterale verdragen, welke eventueel met het land van uitgifte zijn afgesloten met betrekking tot een dergelijke wet.   
5.  De schulden van de Duitse Rentenbank-Kreditanstalt vormen om verschillende redenen een moeilijk probleem. Als gevolg van de splitsing van Duitsland zijn de vermogenswaarden, die belegd zijn in Oost-Duitsland, op het ogenblik aan de beschikking van de Bank onttrokken; in overeenkomstige mate is het bedrag van de onder deze Overeenkomst vallende schulden gereduceerd, zoals zulks in bijzonderheden is vastgelegd in bestaand regelingen, waarbij het percentage in de afzonderlijke gevallen verschilt en tussen 20 % en 67 % van de uitstaande leningen varieert. De Duitse vertegenwoordigers hebben verklaard, dat het op het ogenblik niet in de macht van de Bondsregering ligt aan deze toestand, die in het bijzonder ontstaan is door de desbetreffende wettelijke bepalingen inzake de munthervorming, iets te veranderen. Overeengekomen is echter, dat de Bondsregering alles zal doen om de regeling van de schulden van de Bank en de betaling van de rente- en amortisatietermijnen volgens de bedoelde wetten en verordeningen te vergemakkelijken. De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren behouden voor de door hen vertegenwoordigde crediteuren het recht voor, iedere mogelijkheid voor een actie aan te grijpen, om een regeling te wijzigen, die naar hun mening hun belangen schaadt en een discriminatie betekent van bepaalde groepen van crediteuren. Er is overeengekomen dat de Bank aansprakelijk blijft voor de verplichtingen, welke zijn gedekt door vermogenswaarden in Oost-Duitsland en dat zij deze verplichtingen weer zal nakomen, wanneer deze vermogenswaarden weer tot haar beschikking staan. Dezelfde beginselen zullen worden toegepast ten aanzien van verschillende andere instellingen, die in eenzelfde positie verkeren.   
6.  Bij de behandeling van de Kali-lening volgens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst moet rekening worden gehouden met het bijzondere karakter van die lening.   

### Artikel  IV  

####Bedrag der uitstaande schulden

1.  Het uitstaande bedrag van elke schuld is samengesteld uit de nog niet terugbetaalde hoofdsom en alle tot 1 Januari 1953 verschuldigde en nog niet betaalde renten, waarbij deze rente zonder samengestelde interest wordt berekend volgens de in de bestaande overeenkomst vastgelegde rentevoet, onverschillig of de verplichting voor deze datum verviel en zonder rekening te houden met de gevolgen van een vóór deze datum in gebreke blijven van de debiteur volgens de bepalingen van de bestaande overeenkomst.   
2.  Een bedrag is onbetaald in de zin van 1. hierboven, wanneer het niet door de crediteur is ontvangen en uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend door hem als betaling is aangenomen. Wanneer de crediteur funding bonds, scrips of contant geld van de Konversionskasse heeft aangenomen, zijn hiermede al die verplichtingen of gedeelten daarvan voldaan, waarvoor de crediteur deze prestaties heeft aangenomen.   

### Artikel  V  

####Voorwaarden der regeling

1.   *Hoofdsom*  De uitstaande hoofdsom wordt niet gereduceerd.   
2.   *Schulden in buitenlandse valuta met goud-clausules*  

(a) Gouddollars of Zwitserse goudfrancs: Schulden, luidende in gouddollars of Zwitserse goudfrancs worden omgerekend op basis van: 1 gouddollar is gelijk 1 U.S.-$ en 1 Zwitserse goudfranc is gelijk 1 Zwitserse franc. De nieuwe overeenkomsten luiden in courante U.S.-$ of Zwitserse francs.  

(b) Andere valuta's met goud-clausules: Andere schulden met goud-clausules (uitgezonderd in Duitse valuta luidende schulden met goud-clausules - zie 3 hieronder) zijn alleen betaalbaar in de valuta van het land, waarin de lening opgenomen is of de uitgifte heeft plaatsgevonden (verder genoemd valuta van uitgifte). Het verschuldigde bedrag zal worden berekend als de tegenwaarde van een bedrag in U.S.-$ volgens de wisselkoers, geldend op het tijdstip, waarop het bedrag betaald moet worden. Dit dollarbedrag wordt verkregen door het nominale bedrag van de schuld in de valuta van uitgifte om te rekenen in U.S.-$ tegen de wisselkoers, geldend op het tijdstip van de opneming of uitgifte van de lening. Het aldus berekende bedrag in de valuta van uitgifte mag echter niet lager zijn dan indien het zou zijn berekend volgens de wisselkoers, geldend op 1 Augustus 1952.     
3.   *Schulden in Duitse valuta met goud-clausules*  

(a) Overeengekomen is, dat dergelijke in goudmarken of Rijksmarken met goud-clausule uitgedrukte geldvorderingen uit kapitaalverkeer en hypotheken, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen, zullen worden omgerekend in Duitse mark in de verhouding 1 : 1.  

(b) De definitie van de criteria voor het begrip „specifiek buitenlands karakter” bij dergelijke geldvorderingen zal het onderwerp vormen van verdere onderhandelingen (zie Bijlage VII). Beide partijen behouden zich het recht voor, hun houding nader te bepalen ten aanzien van de vraag, in welke gevallen en op welke wijze het bovenbedoelde beginsel kan worden toegepast. Aan de Duitse delegatie wordt overgelaten te beslissen op welke wijze de oplossing, die zou worden gevonden, kan worden gevoegd in het kader van de Duitse wetgeving inzake de munthervorming en inzake de „Kriegs- und Nachkriegslastenausgleich”.  

(c) Bovenbedoelde onderhandelingen tussen een Duitse delegatie en de vertegenwoordigers van de crediteuren zullen niet later dan 31 October 1952 plaats vinden.     
4.   *Achterstallige renten*  Behoudens de bepalingen in punt 6 zullen twee derden van de tot 1 Januari 1953 niet-betaalde renten worden geconsolideerd, en één derde geschrapt. Deze geconsolideerde renten vormen tezamen met de nog niet terugbetaalde hoofdsom de nieuwe hoofdsom.   
5.   *Nieuwe rentevoet*  Behoudens de bepalingen in lid 6 zal de rente lopen vanaf 1 Januari 1953, onverschillig op welke datum de nieuwe overeenkomst volgens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst wordt gesloten, en wel tot 75 % van de in de bestaande overeenkomst genoemde rentevoet. De nieuwe lopende rentevoet mag echter niet hoger zijn dan 5¼ % bij in obligaties vervatte schulden en 6 % bij andere schulden. De laagste rentevoet bedraagt 4 %; wanneer in de bestaande overeenkomst een lagere rentevoet dan 4 % is opgenomen, blijft deze gehandhaafd.   
6.   *Rentevoet in gevallen van een echte conversie*  Bij schulden, die het voorwerp hebben gevormd van een echte conversie, moet de debiteur, naar zijn keuze, of 

(a) alle op 1 Januari 1953 nog niet betaalde en op grond van de bestaande overeenkomst achterstallige renten consolideren en vanaf deze dag rente betalen geheel overeenkomstig de rentevoet van de bestaande overeenkomst, of  

(b) de nog niet betaalde renten aldus consolideren en de nieuwe renten aldus betalen, alsof de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst nog van kracht was en de leden 4 en 5 van dit artikel van toepassing waren.     
7.   *Betaling van renten*  De renten over het op 1 Januari 1953 aanvangende tijdvak moeten ten minste halfjaarlijks worden betaald. Wanneer de nieuwe overeenkomst op 1 Januari 1954 nog niet is afgesloten, moeten de noodzakelijke aanpassingen worden getroffen, indien van de debiteur niet verwacht kan worden, dat hij alle renten over het tijdvak tussen 1 Januari 1953 en het tijdstip van het afsluiten van de nieuwe overeenkomst ineens betaalt.   
8.   *Betaling van amortisaties*  

(a) Van 1958 tot 1962 zullen jaarlijks amortisatiebedragen worden betaald ad 1 % van de nieuwe hoofdsom en daarna tot op de vervaldatum ad 2 % van de nieuwe Hoofdsom. De amortisatiebedragen voor elk op het jaar 1958 volgend jaar worden telkens verhoogd met de rente verschuldigd over 1 jaar over alle in de voorafgaande jaren geamortiseerde bedragen, met uitzondering echter van die gedeelten van de schuld, welke zijn geamortiseerd door betalingen als bedoeld sub (*d*).  

(b) Amortisatiebetalingen dienen te geschieden op de dag van de eerste rentebetaling in elk jaar. Valt de dag van de eerste rentebetaling in het jaar 1958 niet op de eerste Januari, dan moet de eerste amortisatiebetaling berekend worden over de periode van 1 Januari 1957 tot de dag van rentebetaling; hetzelfde beginsel geldt, wanneer het percentage van 2 % van toepassing is.  

(c) Alle amortisatiebetalingen moeten worden aangewend ter vermindering van de nieuwe hoofdsom. Bij obligaties moeten de amortisatiebetalingen worden aangewend voor aflossing van de obligaties door uitloting a pari of tegen de nominale waarde, tenzij tussen de debiteur en zijn crediteuren anders is overeengekomen.  

(d) Zolang de dienst overeenkomstig de nieuwe overeenkomst wordt voortgezet, kan de debiteur tot aanvullende amortisaties overgaan op elke wijze, ook door het kopen van obligaties op de open markt of anderszins.     
9.   *Looptijd van de leningen*  In de nieuwe overeenkomsten zullen looptijden van minstens 10 jaar en hoogstens 25 jaar, gerekend vanaf 1 Januari 1953, worden opgenomen. De nieuwe looptijd wordt vastgesteld in overleg tussen de debiteur en zijn crediteuren. De debiteur moet binnen hogerbedoelde grenzen de kortste looptijd aanbieden, welke, rekening houdend met zijn omstandigheden, mogelijk is. Het is de bedoeling aan industriële debiteuren, banken en kerkelijke organisaties, looptijden van 10 tot 15 jaar, in uitzonderingsgevallen van 20 jaar, toe te staan. Openbare nutsbedrijven en grondstoffenindustrieën mogen de looptijden tot 20 jaar, doch in geen geval tot meer dan 25 jaar, verlengen. Bij niet in obligaties belichaamde schulden moet de normale looptijd 10 jaar bedragen.   
10.   *Terugbetaling van schulden tot een gering bedrag*  Wanneer het uitstaande bedrag van een schuld zeer gering of in verhouding tot het bedrag van de oorspronkelijke lening gering is, kan een vroegere terugbetaling en definitieve regeling van het totale bedrag van zulk een verplichting, met inbegrip van achterstallige renten, worden overeengekomen, zonder rekening te houden met de bepalingen van de leden 8 en 9 van dit artikel.   
11.   *Hardheidsclausule*  Wanneer ten gevolge van buitengewone omstandigheden - met inbegrip van, echter niet beperkt tot, verlies van vermogenswaarden in Duitsland buiten de Bondsrepubliek en Berlijn (West) - de financiële toestand van een debiteur zo is achteruitgegaan, dat het voor hem onmogelijk en ondoenlijk is een voorstel voor het afsluiten van een nieuwe overeenkomst te doen, overeenkomstig de in deze Overeenkomst neergelegde voorwaarden, dan staat het de debiteur en zijn crediteuren vrij in onderling overleg wijzigingen, die, gezien de bijzondere omstandigheden, noodzakelijk worden geacht, vast te stellen.   
12.   *Garanties*  Voorzover geen wettelijke bepalingen zich daartegen verzetten, blijven de in de bestaande overeenkomst met betrekking tot pandrechten, garanties en andere zekerheden ter bescherming van de crediteuren opgenomen bepalingen van kracht; voorzover echter de op grond van de bestaande overeenkomst gestelde zekerheden naar aard en omvang niet meer in overeenstemming zijn met de nieuwe hoofdsom van de schuld of met de bij het afsluiten van de nieuwe overeenkomst bestaande omstandigheden, kan de debiteur een wijziging van de aard en omvang van de zekerheid voorstellen; de zekerheid, voorgesteld door de debiteur, moet echter afdoende en voor de crediteur aannemelijk zijn. Voorzover de zekerheid verminderd is of een wezenlijke verandering heeft ondergaan, moet de debiteur die aanpassingen aanbrengen, die noodzakelijk zijn om zijn crediteuren minstens de oorspronkelijke graad van zekerheid te verschaffen. De debiteur moet op wens van de crediteur passende zekerheden geven of andere voor de crediteur aanvaardbare maatregelen ter bescherming nemen.   
13.   *Reserve- en amortisatiefonds*  Aangezien de amortisatiebetalingen eerst in het jaar 1958 een aanvang nemen en wel tot het in verhouding lage percentage van 1 %, hetwelk in het jaar 1963 tot slechts 2 % wordt verhoogd, moet de financiële politiek van de debiteur gericht zijn op de vorming van een voldoend sterke liquide financiële positie, teneinde zijn verplichtingen op de vervaldagen na te kunnen komen. Daarom behoort tussen crediteuren en debiteuren over aanvullende overeenkomsten te worden onderhandeld. Deze overeenkomsten kunnen de vorming van reserve- of amortisatiefondsen voor de schulden inhouden; deze fondsen worden gevormd door middel van jaarlijkse bedragen, berekend hetzij als een percentage van de nettowinst vóór de dividendbetaling, hetzij op andere wijze, al naar is overeengekomen.   
14.   *Beschikbaarstelling van de buitenlandse valuta's*  De debiteur moet de maatregelen nemen welke volgens de Duitse wetgeving noodzakelijk zijn om de betalingsmiddelen in buitenlandse valuta, die hij nodig heeft om al zijn verplichtingen uit de nieuwe overeenkomst na te komen, te verkrijgen.   
15.   *In gebreke blijven van de debiteur*  Onverminderd de in de nieuwe overeenkomst vastgelegde gevolgen van in gebreke blijven kunnen de crediteuren voor de duur van het in gebreke blijven betaling van rente verlangen volgens het in de bestaande overeenkomst genoemde percentage.   
16.   *Wijziging van voorwaarden*  Geen bepaling van deze Overeenkomst belet een debiteur, met toestemming van zijn crediteuren, voorwaarden te verkrijgen, welke voor hem gunstiger zijn dan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   
17.   *Concessies ten gunste van de debiteuren*  De crediteuren zijn van mening, dat de voordelen uit de concessies voortvloeiende, en die zij in het kader van deze Overeenkomst doen, ten goede van de debiteuren moeten komen.   

### Artikel  VI  

####Diverse bepalingen met betrekking tot schulden

1.   *Terugbetaling in Duitse valuta*  Iedere debiteur kan op verzoek van zijn crediteuren volledige of gedeeltelijke terugbetaling van een schuld in Duitse valuta doen geschieden.   
2.   *Verandering van crediteur*  Obligaties buiten beschouwing gelaten, kan de crediteur een vordering of een belangrijk deel daarvan overdragen aan een andere persoon gevestigd buiten de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of Berlijn (West) mits de overdracht 

(a) geschiedt aan een persoon gevestigd in hetzelfde valutagebied,  

(b) geen verandering van de voorwaarden, die voor de vordering gelden, ten gevolge heeft,  

(c) niet direct of indirect leidt tot afwikkeling van de schuld.     
3.   *Verandering van debiteur*  De Duitse deviezenautoriteiten zullen voorstellen voor het overnemen van een bestaande schuld door een nieuwe Duitse debiteur, en voor het vervangen van een bestaande zekerheid door een nieuwe, in welwillende overweging nemen.   

### Artikel  VII  

####Procedure voor het afsluiten van nieuwe overeenkomsten

1.  De bepalingen van, en de technische bijzonderheden met betrekking tot de nieuwe tussen crediteuren en debiteuren af te sluiten overeenkomsten moeten worden vervat in het aanbod voor een regeling door de debiteuren.   
2.  Alle voorgestelde overeenkomsten, contracten of acten dienen op wens van de crediteuren, wat vorm en inhoud betreft, aan goedkeuring door een rechtskundig adviseur van de crediteuren te worden onderworpen.   
3.  Iedere debiteur moet voor 30 Juni 1953 of binnen 6 maanden, nadat hij zich in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of Berlijn (West) heeft gevestigd, een gedetailleerd aanbod, voor een regeling uitwerken en aan zijn crediteuren voorleggen. De crediteur kan van de debiteur verlangen, dat hij met hem over de bijzonderheden van het aanbod in onderhandeling treedt, en de debiteur moet aan dit verlangen voldoen.   
4.  De term „crediteur” in de zin van de leden 2 en 3 van dit artikel betekent, indien het om obligaties gaat, de volgens artikel VIII benoemde vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren.   
5.  Bij obligaties kunnen de voorwaarden van de regeling op de aanwezige obligaties gedrukt worden of tegen inlevering van beschikbare obligaties nieuwe obligaties worden uitgegeven; voor de achterstallige renten kunnen nieuwe obligaties of tegen obligaties in te wisselen scrips worden uitgegeven, al naar gelang zulks op de verschillende markten, waar de obligaties oorspronkelijk werden uitgegeven, gebruikelijk en uitvoerbaar is. Dergelijke obligaties met opdruk of nieuwe obligaties moeten in overeenstemming zijn met de bestaande marktgebruiken. De debiteur moet op eigen kosten daarvoor in aanmerking komende bankinstellingen opdracht geven de regeling uit te voeren; hij moet aan alle voorschriften van regeringsinstanties en effectenmarkten voldoen, teneinde de verhandelbaarheid te verzekeren.   

### Artikel  VIII  

####Vertegenwoordiging van de crediteuren

De commissies en organisaties, wier gedelegeerden aan de conferentie over de Duitse buitenlandse schulden als vertegenwoordigers van de daarbij betrokken nationale crediteurengroepen hebben deelgenomen (deze commissies en organisaties worden verder aangeduid als „crediteurencommissies”), dienen, onder voorbehoud van het recht van goedkeuring van hun onderscheidene regeringen, die personen of organisaties tot vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren te benoemen, die nodig zijn om de regeling tussen de individuele debiteuren en hun crediteuren op grond van deze Overeenkomst te bevorderen en tot stand te brengen. Deze commissies en organisaties kunnen ook zelf in bedoelde hoedanigheid optreden. In elk individueel geval zal slechts één vertegenwoordiger of één vertegenwoordigende organisatie worden benoemd; indien echter de crediteurencommissies het noodzakelijk achten om de rechten van de houders van de verschillende emissies van obligaties van een bepaalde debiteur ten volle te beschermen, kunnen voor elke afzonderlijke emissie telkens een vertegenwoordiger of een vertegenwoordigende organisatie worden benoemd. De Duitse debiteur is gerechtigd van de crediteurencommissies de benoeming van vertegenwoordigers te verlangen. De deelneming aan de schuldenconferentie sluit niet uit, dat een persoon in een of andere hoedanigheid aan de onderhandelingen op grond van deze Overeenkomst deelneemt.  

### Artikel  IX  

####Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie

1.   *Competentie*  Teneinde het afsluiten van regelingen tussen de individuele debiteuren en hun crediteuren te bevorderen, zal een Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie worden gevormd. Deze commissie heeft tot taak tussen de debiteur en diens crediteuren te bemiddelen en te arbitreren, wanneer zij over de voorwaarden van het regelingsaanbod niet tot overeenstemming kunnen komen. Iedere partij heeft het recht een geschil voor de commissie te brengen. De beslissing van de commissie is voor beide partijen bindend. De debiteur is verplicht aan zijn crediteuren de in een dergelijke beslissing vastgelegde modaliteiten aan te bieden. De crediteur is verplicht deze modaliteiten te aanvaarden (zie Bijlage II *a*); bij obligaties, terzake waarvan de rechthebbenden ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel VIII van deze Overeenkomst vertegenwoordigd zijn, moeten de vertegenwoordigers der crediteuren de rechthebbenden op de obligaties het aanvaarden van het aanbod aanbevelen. Wanneer volgens artikel VIII een vertegenwoordiger van crediteuren wordt benoemd worden de rechten van de crediteuren volgens artikel IX door deze vertegenwoordiger uitgeoefend.   
2.   *Samenstelling*  De commissie bestaat uit 4 vertegenwoordigers van de crediteuren en 4 vertegenwoordigers van de debiteuren. De commissie kan nog een lid kiezen voor een afzonderlijk geval, wanneer de meerderheid van de leden daartoe de wens te kennen geeft. De voorzitter van de commissie wordt gekozen uit de crediteuren-leden. De eerste voorzitter zal het Amerikaanse lid zijn. Voor elk lid kan een plaatsvervanger worden benoemd. Elk lid van de commissie met inbegrip van de voorzitter heeft een stem.   
3.   *Benoeming van de leden*  De leden der commissie worden op de volgende wijze benoemd: 

(a) De crediteuren-leden worden benoemd door organisaties, die door de onderscheidene crediteuren-commissies van de Verenigde Staten, het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Zwitserland en Nederland worden aangewezen. Wanneer in een bijzonder geval de crediteuren uit een ander land daar speciaal bij betrokken zijn, kan op verzoek van de crediteuren-commissie van dat land een door haar benoemd lid de plaats innemen van een van de gewone leden van de commissie, als haar vertegenwoordiger.  

(b) De debiteuren-leden worden door het hoofd van de Duitse delegatie voor buitenlandse schulden benoemd.     
4.   *Procedure*  De commissie kan voor elk bijzonder geval subcommissies in het leven roepen en tijdelijke leden voor deze subcommissies benoemen. De wijze waarop geschillen aan de commissie voorgelegd en de termijnen vastgesteld worden, regelt de commissie zelf, evenals het tijdstip en de plaats van de zittingen, alsmede alle andere kwesties met betrekking tot de wijze van werken van de commissie of haar subcommissies.   
5.   *Kosten*  De leden van de commissie en de tijdelijke leden ontvangen vergoeding van al hun reiskosten en persoonlijke uitgaven in verband met de vervulling van hun taak. Daarenboven ontvangen zij een door de commissie vast te stellen vergoeding voor de tijd, besteed ter vervulling van hun taak. Alle uitgaven en kosten, ontstaan voor de commissie, haar leden of de tijdelijke leden bij de behandeling van een geschil, worden door de desbetreffende Duitse debiteur vergoed. Wanneer echter de commissie of de bevoegde subcommissie constateert, dat een crediteur zich niet te goeder trouw of lichtvaardig tot haar gewend heeft, moeten de kosten en uitgaven tot het door de commissie of de subcommissie vastgestelde bedrag door die crediteur worden betaald. Alle andere kosten van de commissie en haar leden, met inbegrip van de vergoeding voor leden, die in commissie-aangelegenheden werkzaam zijn, worden over de debiteuren omgeslagen of op andere wijze door hen vergoed.   

### Artikel  X  

####Uitgaven van crediteuren, vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren en andere personen

1.  De debiteuren, die onder deze Overeenkomst vallen, moeten alle uitgaven betalen, welke voor een crediteurencommissie in verband met de schuldenconferentie of met de algemene uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst zijn ontslaan.   
2.  Uitgaven, die voor de crediteuren in verband met de onderhandelingen tussen een debiteur en zijn crediteuren overeenkomstig artikel VII van deze Overeenkomst zijn ontstaan, moeten door de desbetreffende debiteur worden vergoed. Deze uitgaven en vergoedingen zullen bij niet in obligaties belichaamde schulden aan de crediteuren worden betaald en bij wel in obligaties belichaamde schulden aan de volgens artikel VIII van deze Overeenkomst benoemde vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren.   
3.  Het begrip „uitgaven” in de zin van de leden 1 en 2 van dit artikel omvat een redelijke vergoeding voor verleende diensten. Over de redelijkheid beslist bij verschil van mening de Arbitrage- en Bemiddelings-Commissie.   
4.  De in dit artikel vervatte regeling voor de uitgaven sluit niet uit, dat de vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren betaling van aanvullende kosten van de obligatiehouders of andere crediteuren kunnen verlangen.   

### Artikel  XI  

####Inwerkingtreding

Geen betalingen mogen worden gedaan overeenkomstig de bepalingen van een regeling, aangeboden op grond van deze Overeenkomst, voordat de Overeenkomst nopend Duitse buitenlandse schulden in werking is getreden. De debiteuren moeten echter onverwijld hun crediteuren voorwaarden voor een regeling overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VII van deze Overeenkomst aanbieden, de onderhandelingen die noodzakelijk zijn voeren en ook overigens alle maatregelen treffen, om de voorbereiding van een nieuw aanbod als bedoeld in deze Overeenkomst te bevorderen.  

### BIJLAGE  IIa  

####Interpretatie van de tweede alinea van lid 1 van artikel IX van Bijlage II

Aan de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden, 29, Chesham Place, Londen S.W. 1.  *Londen, 12 November 1952.*  Mijne Heren, Onze aandacht is er op gevestigd, dat een misverstand is ontstaan over de tweede alinea van lid 1 van artikel IX van bijlage 4 van het rapport over de conferentie inzake Duitse buitenlandse schulden. Deze alinea luidt als volgt: „De beslissing van de commissie is voor beide partijen bindend. De debiteur is verplicht aan zijn crediteuren de in een dergelijke beslissing vastgelegde modaliteiten aan te bieden. De crediteur is verplicht *deze modaliteiten te aanvaarden;* bij obligaties, terzake waarvan de rechthebbenden in gevolge de bepalingen van artikel VIII van deze Overeenkomst vertegenwoordigd zijn, moeten de vertegenwoordigers der crediteuren de rechthebbenden op de obligaties het aanvaarden van het aanbod aanbevelen.” De gecursiveerde woorden „deze modaliteiten te aanvaarden” hebben tot misverstand geleid. Tot een juiste interpretatie zou gekomen worden, indien in plaats van bedoelde woorden gesteld zou worden „deze modaliteiten als in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te erkennen.” Wij zouden de Drie Mogendheden Commissie verplicht zijn als zij er nota van wilde nemen, dat bovenaangehaalde tweede alinea van lid 1 van artikel IX van bijlage 4 ten rechte zo is op te vatten, als ware zij in de gewijzigde vorm geredigeerd, dat wil zeggen als wanneer zij luidde: „De beslissing van de commissie is voor beide partijen bindend. De debiteur is verplicht aan zijn crediteuren de in een dergelijke beslissing vastgelegde modaliteiten aan te bieden. De crediteur is verplicht *deze modaliteiten als in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te erkennen;* bij obligaties, terzake waarvan de rechthebbenden ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel VIII van deze Overeenkomst vertegenwoordigd zijn, moeten de vertegenwoordigers der crediteuren de rechthebbenden op de obligaties het aanvaarden van het aanbod aanbevelen.” Met de meeste hoogachting, (w.g.) N. LEGGETT Voorzitter van het Onderhandelings- comité B van de conferentie over Duitse buitenlandse schulden. (w.g.) HERMANN J. ABS Voorzitter van de Duitse delegatie voor de buitenlandse schulden.   

### BIJLAGE  III  

####Aanbevelingen aangenomen voor de regeling van de „Stilhalteschulden”:

*Duitse Credietovereenkomst van 1952*   

*OVEREENKOMST* gesloten tussen een COMITÉ, vertegenwoordigende de BANKEN, HANDELS- en INDUSTRIËLE ONDERNEMINGEN in de BONDSREPUBLIEK DUITSLAND en BERLIJN (WEST) (hierna genoemd „het Duitse Comité”, waarbij deze uitdrukking iedere instelling en iedere organisatie omvat, die enigerlei taak overneemt van die zijner taken, welke met deze overeenkomst samenhangen), de BANK DEUTSCHER LÄNDER (hieronder mede te verstaan iedere instelling of iedere organisatie die enigerlei taak overneemt van die harer taken, welke met deze overeenkomst samenhangen) en die hieronder volgende comité's (hierna gezamenlijk aangeduid als „de Comité's van buitenlandse bankiers”) die deze overeenkomst zullen ondertekenen, te weten COMITÉ'S vertegenwoordigende BANKINSTELLINGEN die onderscheidenlijk hun bedrijf uitoefenen in de VERENIGDE STATEN VAN AMERIKA, het VERENIGD KONINKRIJK en ZWITSERLAND. Overwegende: 

1. Dat een overeenkomst voor de instandhouding van aan Duitsland verleende kortlopende credieten, in werking getreden op 17 September 1931, door de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren is afgesloten, waarmede gevolg werd gegeven aan het verzoek van de te Londen in Juli 1932 gehouden Zeven Mogendheden Conferentie, „dat de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren van Duitsland gemeenschappelijke maatregelen zouden treffen tot instandhouding van het volume der aan Duitsland verleende credieten”, zich daarbij baserend op de verklaring van die conferentie dat „ten einde de handhaving te verzekeren van de financiële stabiliteit van Duitsland, welke essentieel is voor de belangen van de gehele wereld” de betrokken regeringen „bereid waren om, zover dit in hun macht lag, samen te werken voor het herstel van het vertrouwen”.  

2. Dat de instandhouding van deze kortlopende bankcredieten door een reeks van jaarlijkse overeenkomsten is voortgezet, waarvan de laatste (hierna genoemd „de overeenkomst van 1939”) af zou lopen per 31 Mei 1940 doch ten gevolge van het uitbreken van de vijandelijkheden tussen Duitsland en het Verenigd Koninkrijk en deszelfs Geallieerden op 4 September 1939 namens het Comité der Banken-crediteuren in de Verenigde Staten en Engeland, in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden van die overeenkomst, werd opgezegd en beëindigd.  

3. Dat na afloop van de overeenkomst van 1939 tussen het Comité van Amerikaanse crediteuren en de betrokken Duitse partijen in de jaren 1939 en 1940 overeenkomsten werden afgesloten tot verdere instandhouding (met bepaalde beperkingen en wijzigingen) van die kortlopende bankcredieten die door de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren in de Verenigde Staten waren verleend; de hierbedoelde tweede overeenkomst expireerde op 31 Mei 1941.  

4. Dat na afloop van de overeenkomst van 1939 tussen het Comité van Zwitserse crediteuren en de betrokken Duitse partijen andere overeenkomsten werden afgesloten ter verdere instandhouding (met bepaalde beperkingen en wijzigingen) van die kortlopende bankcredieten, die door buitenlandse banken-crediteuren in Zwitserland waren verleend; deze overeenkomsten zijn echter intussen alle geëxpireerd.  

5. Dat overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de laatste der daarop van toepassing zijnde vroegere overeenkomsten de totale schuld van Duitsland uit hoofde van meerbedoelde kortlopende bankcredieten bij afloop van de desbetreffende overeenkomst met de daarin gestipuleerde gevolgen, verviel en dat de totale schuld (met inbegrip van de schuld uit hoofde van credieten, die in de plaats van voorheen krachtens een of meer van de vroegere overeenkomst verleende credieten waren verstrekt) opeisbaar werd en door de betrokken debiteur moest worden betaald (met vervallen en nog vervallende rente en overige kosten) in de desbetreffende vreemde valuta; de schuld is opeisbaar en betaalbaar gebleven, voorzover zij niet inmiddels door betaling of op andere wijze door voldoening in buitenlandse of Duitse valuta is gedelgd of verminderd. Tot nog toe zijn geen maatregelen genomen die het nakomen van het restant van deze verplichting in de verschuldigde valuta mogelijk maken.  

6. Dat door bemiddeling van het Duitse Comité bankinstellingen, handels- en industriële ondernerningen in de Bondsrepubliek hun buitenlandse banken-crediteuren hebben verzocht een nieuwe overeenkomst af te sluiten ter regeling van de betaling der uitstaande kortlopende schuld en voor het nemen van maatregelen voor het herstellen van normale voorwaarden voor de financiering van de buitenlandse handel van de Bondsrepubliek; dat ter tegemoetkoming aan dit verzoek passende bepalingen zijn geformuleerd en in deze overeenkomst neergelegd, en de buitenlandse bankiers-comité's zich bereid hebben verklaard aan de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren in hun onderscheidene landen toetreding tot deze overeenkomst aan te bevelen.  

7. Dat deze overeenkomst door de comité's van buitenlandse bankiers geaccepteerd is onder voorwaarde dat, zolang deze overeenkomst van kracht blijft, die wetten en verordeningen door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek of een andere bevoegde overheidsinstantie uitgevaardigd en in stand zullen worden gehouden, als noodzakelijk zijn om uitvoering te geven aan de bepalingen van deze nieuwe overeenkomst en dat geen wetten of verordeningen zullen worden uitgevaardigd die een werkelijke inbreuk zouden betekenen op de verplichtingen die in deze overeenkomst zijn neergelegd. Met name moeten de uit te vaardigen en te handhaven voorschriften waarborgen: <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup> 

(i) dat de bankinstellingen, handels- en industriële ondernemingen in de Bondsrepubliek geen discriminatie met betrekking tot terugbetalingen of het geven van waarborgen zullen toepassen ten aanzien van buitenlandse banken-crediteuren, onverschillig of deze tot de overeenkomst zijn toegetreden of niet;  

(ii) dat de bankinstellingen Voor handels- en industriële ondernemingen in de Bondsrepubliek geen discriminatie tussen hun crediteuren in de Bondsrepubliek en hun buitenlandse banken-crediteuren, onverschillig of deze tot de overeenkomst zijn toegetreden of niet, zullen toepassen met betrekking tot het geven van waarborgen; <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>  

(iii) dat ongeoorloofde kapitaalbewegingen zullen worden verhinderd; en <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>  

(iv) dat alle bankinstellingen, handels- en industriële ondernemingen in de Bondsrepubliek die in enigerlei onder deze overeenkomst vallende vorm schulden hebben, tot deze overeenkomst zullen toetreden. <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>     Wordt derhalve het volgende overeengekomen:    

### 1  

####Definities

Voorzover de samenhang niet een andere uitleg vereist, hebben in deze overeenkomst de hierna genoemde termen de volgende betekenis: „Kortlopende credieten” betekent en omvat: 

(i) alle accepten, termijndeposito's, voorschotten in contanten en/of iedere andere op speciale overeenkomst berustende vorm van schuldvorderingen luidende in niet-Duitse valuta ten aanzien van welke een buitenlandse bank-crediteur toegetreden is tot de laatste der hierop toepasselijke vroegere overeenkomsten en welke op het tijdstip van het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst nog bestaat; er is niet onder begrepen een schuld voortvloeiend uit kortlopende bankcredieten verleend aan bankinstellingen, handels- en industriële ondernemingen in een land, gelegen buiten het gebied, dat op 31 December 1937 tot het Duitse Rijk behoorde, tenzij een bankier, een bankinstelling of een handels- of industriële onderneming of -vennootschap gevestigd in de Bondsrepubliek (overeenkomstig de hieronder volgende definitie) aansprakelijk is voor deze schuld (hetzij van de aanvang af of door erfopvolging, of als garant, borg, endossant);

Na de toetreding moeten dergelijke credieten met het oog op de toepassing van deze overeenkomst in elk opzicht worden behandeld als aan de Duitse moederonderneming of vennootschap ter beschikking gestelde kortlopende credieten;

(iii) Iedere publiekrechtelijke Duitse schuldenaar in de zin van de definities van de credietovereenkomst voor publiekrechtelijke Duitse schuldenaren van 1932.   „Duitse bank-debiteur” betekent iedere Duitse debiteur wiens bedrijf in de eerste plaats het bankbedrijf tot voorwerp heeft. „Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur” betekent iedere Duitse debiteur die niet Duitse bank-debiteur is of publiekrechtelijke Duitse debiteur in de zin van de onderhavige definities. „Opvolger” betekent en omvat:

####Duur van de overeenkomst

<sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>   
(1).  Voorzover niet anders bepaald is, treden de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst op ...… 1952 in werking; zij blijven van kracht gedurende een periode van 12 kalendermaanden gerekend vanaf genoemde datum. Echter kan de overeenkomst door de buitenlandse bank-comité's vervroegd worden opgezegd in elk der volgende gevallen: 

(i) Indien in de Bondsrepubliek een moratorium wordt afgekondigd, dat betrekking heeft op enigerlei verplichting van Duitse debiteuren tegenover buitenlandse banken-crediteuren krachtens deze overeenkomst, of  

(ii) Indien in de toekomst internationale beslissingen of maatregelen van regeringswege van financiële, politieke of economische aard een toestand doen ontstaan, die naar de opvatting van de meerderheid der buitenlandse bank-comité's de toepassing van deze overeenkomst ernstig in gevaar brengt, of  

(iii) Indien de buitenlandse bank-comité's na hierop de aandacht van het Duitse Comité te hebben gevestigd, zouden vaststellen dat een der in de inleiding (7) vervatte voorwaarden niet nagekomen is.     
(2).  Een dergelijke opzegging laat de rechten en verplichtingen, welke vóór het tijdstip der opzegging uit deze overeenkomst zijn voortgevloeid, onaangetast. Zij behoort, om effectief te zijn, schriftelijk te worden medegedeeld, of door middel van een telegram of radiogram (onder opgave van het tijdstip waarop de overeenkomst beëindigd zal worden). De mededeling moet namens de meerderheid van de buitenlandse banken-comité's ondertekend zijn en gericht zijn aan de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen en aan het Duitse Comité. Het niet doen van een dergelijke mededeling aan het Duitse Comité maakt de opzegging echter niet krachteloos.   
(3).  De afkondiging van een algemeen moratorium ten aanzien van het buitenland in de Bondsrepubliek, in welke vorm ook, brengt ipso facto de beëindiging van de overeenkomst met zich mede.   

### 3  

####Instandhouding van de credieten, enz.

(1).  Zolang deze overeenkomst van kracht is wordt het recht van iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur op terugbetaling van kortlopende credieten, in verband waarmede hij tot deze overeenkomst toegetreden is, opgeschort tot aan het aflopen van deze overeenkomst, voorzover een dergelijke buitenlandse bank-crediteur niet op grond van enigerlei bepaling van deze overeenkomst aanspraak heeft op eerdere betaling. Iedere Duitse debiteur verklaart, door toetreding tot deze overeenkomst, ermede accoord te gaan dat alle kortlopende credieten, in verband waarmede hij toegetreden is, bij het aflopen van deze overeenkomst integraal vervallen en betaalbaar zijn in de desbetreffende buitenlandse valuta, onder aftrek van eventuele reducties, die op grond van enigerlei bepaling van deze overeenkomst zullen zijn toegepast vóór het aflopen daarvan.   
(2).  Noch de toepassing van deze overeenkomst, noch enigerlei der daarin vervatte bepalingen mag op enigerlei wijze de rechten en de verplichtingen van een buitenlandse bank-crediteur of van zijn Duitse debiteur met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet aantasten, voorzover zij voortvloeien uit: 

(i) Een handeling of het nalaten van een handeling ten gunste van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur door de Duitse schuldenaar in de periode tussen de beëindiging van de laatste vroegere overeenkomst, die van toepassing was op het desbetreffende kortlopende crediet en het in werking treden van deze overeenkomst, of  

(ii) De uitoefening van enigerlei aan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur gedurende de in de vorige alinea genoemde periode toekomend recht of bevoegdheid.   Toetreding door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur tot deze overeenkomst met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet geldt als een erkenning en bevestiging van elke door zijn Duitse debiteur ten gunste van de belanghebbende buitenlandse bank-crediteur in overeenstemming met de voorgaande paragraaf (i) genomen maatregelen; deze erkenning wordt geacht van kracht te zijn vanaf het tijdstip, waarop bedoelde maatregelen genomen werden.   
(3).  De in de vorige alinea bedoelde erkenning heeft geen betrekking op betalingen door Duitse debiteuren in Duitse valuta, met uitzondering van dergelijke betalingen, welke met uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur aan deze of voor zijn rekening zijn gedaan.   
(4).  Ten aanzien van kortlopende credieten of gedeelten daarvan, waarvoor een Duitse bank-debiteur overeenkomstig artikel 7, paragraaf 1 van de overeenkomst van 1939 (of van overeenkomstige bepalingen van een latere overeenkomst) een „eigene Wechsel” of een schriftelijke garantie van zijn cliënt moest afgeven, moet hij na toetreding tot deze overeenkomst aan de buitenlandse bankcrediteur een nieuwe „eigene Wechsel” afgeven of (indien de buitenlandse bank-crediteur zulks wenst) een nieuwe schriftelijke garantie, die niet vroeger gedateerd mag zijn dan deze overeenkomst; hij moet deze voor de buitenlandse bank-crediteur onder zich houden of aan deze toezenden, overeenkomstig de voorschriften van genoemde paragraaf (of overeenkomstige bepalingen). In een dergelijke schriftelijke garantie moet de cliënt zich verbinden, de Duitse bank-debiteur in de door deze gewenste vorm en in de gewenste mate schadeloos te zullen stellen, indien deze bank-debiteur vrijwillig het desbetreffende kortlopende crediet of een deel daarvan overeenkomstig artikel 10 van deze overeenkomst in Duitse Valuta terugbetaalt.   
(5).  Iedere Duitse bank-debiteur of Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur is gehouden voor zijn rekening op de vervaldag wissels, die door een buitenlandse bank-crediteur zijn geaccepteerd, te voldoen.   
(6).  Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur, die een kortlopend crediet heeft in een andere valuta dan die van zijn eigen land, kan te allen tijde gedurende het van kracht zijn van deze overeenkomst, door een schriftelijke mededeling aan zijn Duitse debiteur, een dergelijk crediet omzetten in de valuta van het land van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur. Deze omzetting moet vervolgens worden uitgevoerd in de boeken van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur en van de Duitse debiteur; het in de nieuwe valuta uitgedrukte bedrag van het kortlopende crediet moet, op basis van de officiële middenkoers op het tijdstip van de mededeling tussen de Duitse valuta en de valuta, waarin het crediet oorspronkelijk luidde enerzijds, en tussen de Duitse valuta en de nieuwe valuta anderzijds, berekend worden.   

### 4  

####Schuldreductie (voorlopig niet van kracht)

Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur heeft het recht drie maanden na het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst en vervolgens na verloop van telkens drie kalendermaanden gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst definitieve terugbetaling te eisen van ... % van het totaalbedrag van de hem door zijn Duitse debiteuren bij het in werking treden van deze overeenkomst verschuldigde kortlopende credieten, met het oog waarop de toetreding heeft plaats gevonden. Deze terugbetaling moet geschieden in de valuta van het land van inwoning van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur en het recht op terugbetaling van de gezamenlijke kortlopende credieten met ... % kan door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur worden uitgeoefend door toepassing van dit recht op terugbetaling van de gezamenlijke credieten naar zijn keuze op de door een of meer van zijn Duitse debiteuren verschuldigde kortlopende credieten. De buitenlandse bank-crediteur heeft het recht, zijn rechten op terugbetaling uit te oefenen ten aanzien van een bepaalde schuld van een bepaalde Duitse debiteur. (N.B. *Voor de betalingsmodaliteiten zullen eventueel verdere bepalingen nodig zijn.)*  

### 5  

####Recommercialisatie

(1).  De Bank Deutscher Länder zal periodiek aan de buitenlandse bank-crediteuren mededelen, dat een bepaald percentage (hierna genoemd „vastgesteld percentage”) van de gezamenlijke kortlopende credieten van iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur, die op het tijdstip van het afsluiten dezer overeenkomst verschuldigd zijn, gerecommercialiseerd wordt.   
(2).  Daarna kan iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur binnen 3 maanden na een dergelijke mededeling met banken of andere firma's in de Bondsrepubliek (die volgens de definities van deze overeenkomst Duitse debiteuren zijn of kunnen worden) overeenkomsten treffen over het openen van nieuwe „Kreditlinien” (hierna genoemd „Ersatzlinien”) tot het beloop van het vastgestelde percentage van zijn in de voorgaande alinea bedoelde gezamenlijke kortlopende credieten.   
(3).  Na het tot stand komen van een dergelijke overeenkomst deelt de buitenlandse bank-crediteur aan de Bank Deutscher Länder mede, dat het in het voornemen ligt de desbetreffende ,,Ersatzlinien” te openen tegen definitieve terugbetaling van een gelijk bedrag aan bepaaldelijk aangewezen kortlopende credieten of gedeelten daarvan (hierna genoemd „nader aangewezen schuld”), verschuldigd door een Duitse debiteur (hierna genoemd „nader aangewezen debiteur”), die door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur is aangewezen. De Bank Deutscher Länder heeft het recht, aan de overeenkomst haar toestemming te onthouden, indien zij er niet van overtuigd is, dat de nieuwe debiteur voldoende gebruik kan maken van de „Ersatzlinie”; dit geldt niet indien de Ersatzlinie verleend wordt aan een Duitse bank voor buitenlandse handel (Aussenhandelsbank).   
(4).  Indien de Bank Deutscher Länder tegen de overeenkomst tot recommercialisatie geen bezwaar maakt overeenkomstig de voorgaande paragraaf, deelt de buitenlandse bank-crediteur aan de nader aangewezen debiteur mede dat hij de nader aangewezen schuld moet terugbetalen. De debiteur moet daarop zo snel mogelijk de terugbetaling in buitenlandse valuta door bemiddeling van de Bank Deutscher Länder verrichten. Na de terugbetaling kan van de Ersatzlinie gebruik worden gemaakt.   
(5).  Een buitenlandse bank-crediteur, die een zekerheid heeft ontvangen voor een aangewezen schuld, zal de nader aangewezen debiteur kennis geven van zijn bereidheid om bij een gedeeltelijke terugbetaling tegen die terugbetaling een evenredig deel der zekerheid vrij te geven, tenzij de zekerheid ondeelbaar is, of de overeenkomst tussen de partijen iets anders behaalt. Laat de buitenlandse bankcrediteur na een dergelijke mededeling te doen, dan is hij niet gerechtigd de terugbetaling van de desbetreffende schuld te eisen.   
(6).  Een buitenlandse bank-crediteur, die een crediet voor gezamenlijke rekening in de zin van artikel 7 van de Duitse credietovereenkomst van 1931 heeft geopend of daaraan heeft deelgenomen, en die op grond van nog bestaande, de onderlinge rechtsbetrekkingen tussen partijen regelende afspraken het recht heeft, in verband met zijn deelname een afzonderlijke terugbetaling te eisen, mag geen terugbetaling van de schuld van een Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur eisen, als hij niet gelijktijdig terugbetaling verlangt van tenminste een evenredig deel der schuld van de Duitse bank-debiteur uit hoofde van het gemeenschappelijk crediet, indien althans de betrokken Duitse bank-debiteur tot deze overeenkomst toegetreden is.   
(7).  Geen consortium kan als zodanig gebruik maken van de rechten die aan een buitenlandse bank-crediteur krachtens dit artikel toegekend worden. Eventuele rechten van de afzonderlijke deelnemers aan het consortium die hun toekomen hetzij in geval van uittreden uit het consortium, hetzij op grond van overeenkomsten met het consortium, om voor zich alleen terugbetaling op grond van dit artikel te verlangen, worden door dit artikel niet aangetast.   
(8).  „Ersatzlinien”, mogen slechts gebruikt worden door het trekken van wissels, die de financiering van de handel tussen de Bondsrepubliek en andere landen dienen, doch niet met het doel deviezen te creëren of ter financiering van zaken, die doelmatiger gefinancierd kunnen worden met binnenlandse credieten. Echter zal een buitenlandse bank-crediteur niet verplicht zijn een wissel te accepteren voor een transactie, die te dien tijde verboden is of niet goedgekeurd wordt door de bevoegde instanties in het land van de buitenlandse crediteur, of die door de bankinstellingen in het betrokken land normaliter niet gefinancierd zouden worden door middel van een accept-crediet. In geval van verschil van mening over de vraag of een wissel aan deze voorwaarden voldoet, dient deze vraag te worden beslecht in onderling overleg tussen de belanghebbende buitenlandse bankencommissie en het Duitse Comité. Alle uitstaande wissels moeten door de Duitse debiteur telkens op de vervaldag contant in de valuta, waarin het crediet luidt, worden afgedekt, en de aldus beschikbaar gekomen credietbedragen mogen slechts wederom in overeenstemming met dit artikel worden gebruikt. Voor de hier bedoelde contante betaling mag de Duitse debiteur de opbrengst van een nieuwe wissel aanwenden, doch slechts onder de volgende voorwaarden, te weten: 

(i) Dat de nieuwe wissel aan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur zo mogelijk een week, doch tenminste 4 werkdagen voor de vervaldag van de wissel, die zal vervallen, wordt aangeboden, zulks onder mededeling dat de opbrengst bestemd is tot afdekking van de wissel, die zal vervallen;  

(ii) Dat de nieuwe wissel voldoet aan de vereisten van dit artikel;  

(iii) Dat de buitenlandse bank-crediteur de nieuwe wissel heeft geaccepteerd voor de vervaldag van de wissel, die vervallen zal. Wordt een aldus aangeboden nieuwe wissel door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur niet geaccepteerd op grond van het feit dat deze niet voldoet aan de vereisten van dit artikel, dan is de Duitse debiteur verplicht de wissel, die vervallen zal, stipt op de vervaldag door overmaking van contanten af te dekken. In een dergelijk geval mag hij door bemiddeling van het Duitse Comité bij de betrokken buitenlandse bankken-comité's in beroep gaan, en indien bedoelde comité's het erover eens zijn, dat de nieuwe wissel voldoet aan de vereisten van dit artikel, dan is de buitenlandse bank-crediteur verplicht deze te accepteren.     
(9).  Laat een buitenlandse bank-crediteur na, binnen 3 maanden na iedere mededeling omtrent een vastgesteld percentage, van zijn rechten tot recommercialisatie geheel of gedeeltelijk gebruik te maken, dan vervalt zijn recht (zonder dat hierdoor echter het recht van deze buitenlandse bank-crediteur op verdere recommercialisaties na mededeling van een nieuw vastgesteld percentage wordt aangetast).   
(10).  De Bank Deutscher Länder zal al het mogelijke doen om te bereiken, dat een zekere hoeveelheid zaken voor de recommercialisatie ter beschikking zal zijn.   
(11).  Een buitenlandse bank-crediteur die een Ersatzlinie heeft geopend, en de debiteur, aan wie een dergelijk crediet wordt verleend zijn, wat deze Ersatzlinien betreft, onderworpen aan alle bepalingen van deze overeenkomst. Verklaringen betreffende de toetreding met betrekking hierop moeten worden uitgewisseld, zodra de buitenlandse bank-crediteur terugbetaling van de desbetreffende aangewezen schuld verkregen heeft.   
(12).  Indien naar de mening van de Bank Deutscher Länder een Ersatzlinie niet voldoende wordt gebruikt in het belang van de Duitse economie, dan kan de Bank Deutscher Länder van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur verlangen, dat hij dat deel van het crediet, dat nog niet verbruikt is ter beschikking stelt van andere, door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur uitgekozen en niet door de Bank Deutscher Länder afgewezen banken of bankinstellingen of handels- of industrieondernemingen of -vennootschappen in de Bondsrepubliek (die Duitse debiteuren zijn of zullen worden). In een dergelijk geval vervalt de oorspronkelijke Ersatzlinie pro tanto, en het nieuwe crediet vormt tot een gelijk bedrag een nieuwe Ersatzlinie; de buitenlandse bankcrediteur is, evenals de nieuwe Duitse debiteur, wat betreft de nieuwe Ersatzlinie, onderworpen aan alle bepalingen van deze overeenkomst, terzake waarvan verklaringen van toetreding moeten worden uitgewisseld. Laat de buitenlandse bank-crediteur het na ten genoege van de Bank Deutscher Länder een nieuwe Duitse debiteur aan te wijzen, dan kan deze een nieuwe Duitse debiteur voorstellen; weigert de buitenlandse bank-crediteur de voorgestelde nieuwe Duitse debiteur te aanvaarden dan moet over de gegrondheid van deze weigering, op verzoek van de Bank Deutscher Länder beslist worden door overleg tussen het Duitse Comité en het bevoegde buitenlandse bankencomité; komen deze comité's niet tot overeenstemming dan beslist de arbitrage-commissie.

####Zekerheidsstellingen

(1).  

(a) Indien 

(i) een Duitse bank-debiteur van een van zijn cliënten voor te diens beschikking gestelde credieten als dekking enigerlei zekerheid heeft ontvangen, ongeacht of dit een algemene of een bijzondere zekerheidsstelling is (met inbegrip van garanties en borgen), en  

(ii) de aan de desbetreffende cliënt verleende credieten, al of niet met zekerheidsstellingen, voortvloeien uit een kortlopend crediet, dat de Duitse bank-debiteur opgenomen heeft bij een of meer buitenlandse bank-crediteuren,dan moet de Duitse bank-debiteur de zekerheid, die hij dan onder zich heeft, in haar geheel of voor een evenredig deel als „Treuhänder” voor de belanghebbende buitenlandse bank-crediteuren bewaren op dezelfde voorwaarden, waarop hij deze zekerheid zelf heeft, overeenkomstig de wettelijke voorschriften voor „Treuhänder”. Dit „Treuhänderschaft” laat het recht van de Duitse bankdebiteur om de daarvoor in aanmerking komende door hem dan gehouden zekerheden overeenkomstig het bestaande bankgebruik te behandelen, onaangetast.    

(b) Indien tot executie van het tot zekerheid gestelde moet worden overgegaan, moet de opbrengst tussen de Duitse bank-debiteur en de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren voorzover dit mogelijk is verdeeld worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen die op grond van de overeenkomst van 1930 voor een dergelijke verdeling zouden gelden.  

(c) Telkens als hun dit noodzakelijk voorkomt ter bescherming van hun eigen belangen en ter bescherming van de belangen van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, moeten de Duitse banken-debiteuren ook verder zekerheidsstellingen van hun klanten eisen en tot passende hoogte in stand houden.  

(d) Iedere Duitse bank-debiteur moet aan zijn buitenlandse banken-crediteuren schriftelijk bevestigen, dat hij voor hen zekerheden volgens de bepalingen van dit artikel als „Treuhänder” bewaart en voorts moet hij aan zijn buitenlandse banken-crediteuren op hun algemeen of speciaal verzoek per 30 Juni en 31 December opgemaakte staten doen toekomen, waaruit zal blijken: (i) de in procenten geschatte omvang, waarin de in paragraaf (*a*) van dit lid bedoelde kortlopende credieten door zekerheden zijn gedekt, (ii) het totaal bedrag der door de Duitse bank-debiteur aan de buitenlandse bankcrediteur, aan wie de staat gericht is, verschuldigde kortlopende credieten, (iii) de geschatte waarde van het aandeel van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur in de in (i) bedoelde zekerheden en (iv) bijzonderheden aangaande de bedoelde zekerheden, waaruit de aard daarvan zal blijken en de omvang waarin zekerheden met betrekking tot de verplichtingen van iedere afzonderlijke cliënt worden aangehouden. Deze staten moeten afgegeven worden volgens een model, vast te stellen in overleg tussen het Duitse Comité en de buitenlandse banken-comité's.     
(2).  Voor kortlopende credieten voor rekening van Duitse handels- of industriële debiteuren moet de Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur ter dekking zekerheid stellen ten behoeve van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, en wel: 

(a) Indien en voorzover de Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur verplicht was op grond van een overeenkomst, bestaande overeenkomstig de laatste der vroegere, op het desbetreffende kortlopende crediet toepasselijke overeenkomst, een zekerheid te stellen, moet hij gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst ook verder een soortgelijke zekerheid, en in dezelfde omvang, stellen.  

(b) Indien en voorzover het stellen van een zekerheid in overeenstemming is met het bedrijf van de Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur en de zekerheid gegeven kan worden zonder de positie van andere crediteuren in gevaar te brengen.     
(3).  Een Duitse debiteur moet onverwijld aan ieder van zijn buitenlandse banken-crediteuren op diens verlangen een exemplaar doen toekomen van zijn laatste goedgekeurde balans en verdere bijzonderheden verstrekken over zijn financiële toestand, welke de buitenlandse bank-crediteur redelijkerwijze kan vergen.   
(4).  Een buitenlands bank-crediteur kan met toestemming van de de Bank Deutscher Länder elke zekerheid, die op het tijdstip van het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet bestond, buiten het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek realiseren en de netto-opbrengst daarvan (na betaling van alle kosten ontstaan door de realisering) gebruiken ter definitieve vermindering of ter delging van het desbetreffende kortlopende crediet. Hierbij wordt vooropgesteld, dat hij verplicht is de in het belang van de Duitse debiteur billijkerwijze te verkrijgen beste voorwaarden te bedingen.   

### 7  

####Overdracht van kortlopende credieten door de crediteuren

Een buitenlandse bank-crediteur heeft het recht elk kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan (i) over te dragen aan een andere buitenlandse bank-crediteur of (ii) aan iedere voor dit doel door het buitenlandse banken-comité van het land van de crediteur in kwestie en door het Duitse Comité goedgekeurde andere persoon, firma of vennootschap, mits 

(a) een zodanige overdracht geen wijziging ten gevolge heeft van de voorwaarden, die golden voor het crediet of een gedeelte daarvan, tenzij de betrokken Duitse debiteur zijn toestemming daaraan hecht;  

(b) terstond na het tot stand komen van een dergelijke overdracht de vereiste verklaringen van toetreding tussen de nieuwe crediteur en de Duitse debiteur worden uitgewisseld;  

(c) iedere zodanige overdracht aan een buitenlandse bank-crediteur of aan een der andere hierboven bedoelde personen, firma's of vennootschappen in het land van een der andere buitenlandse bankencomité's bovendien aan de toestemming van de Bank Deutscher Länder onderworpen wordt.   Is eenmaal de overdracht tot stand gekomen en zijn de vereiste verklaringen van toetreding uitgewisseld, dan heeft de nieuwe crediteur dezelfde rechten en verplichtingen met betrekking tot het kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan als ware hij de oorspronkelijke crediteur.  

### 8  

####Verwisseling van debiteur

Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur kan op ieder gewenst tijdstip gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst met toestemming van de Duitse debiteur (die hiervoor vooraf de toestemming van de Bank Deutscher Länder moet vragen) maatregelen nemen met betrekking tot de overdracht van de verplichtingen, voortvloeiend uit een door een Duitse debiteur verschuldigd kortlopend crediet (waaronder niet te verstaan is een „Ersatzlinie” in de zin van artikel 5 van deze overeenkomst) op een andere bankier, een andere bankinstelling of een andere handels- of industriële firma of vennootschap in de Bondsrepubliek (die Duitse debiteur zijn of kunnen worden). Is de overdracht tot stand gekomen, dan zijn de buitenlandse bank-crediteur en de nieuwe Duitse debiteur met betrekking tot het crediet onderworpen aan alle bepalingen van deze overeenkomst, en de daarop betrekking hebbende verklaringen van toetreding moeten worden uitgewisseld.  

### 9  

####Het openen van nieuwe credieten

(1).  Indien een buitenlandse bank-crediteur gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst ten behoeve van de Duitse volkshuishouding nieuwe credieten in vreemde valuta ter beschikking stelt door aan een Duitse bank, een Duitse bankinstelling of een Duitse handels- of industriële onderneming of -vennootschap een nieuw crediet (waaronder niet te verstaan is een „Ersatzlinie” in de zin van artikel 5 van deze overeenkomst) in niet-Duitse valuta ter financiering van de handel tussen de Bondsrepubliek en andere landen ter beschikking te stellen, dan brengt iedere oorspronkelijke en latere gebruikmaking van dat crediet een recht mede op terugbetaling overeenkomstig dit artikel ten belope van 3 % van het gebruikte bedrag voor elke 3 maanden van de in gebruikneming. Een dergelijk nieuw crediet is niet aan deze overeenkomst onderworpen.   
(2).  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel moet onder „gebruikmaking” worden begrepen het accepteren van een wissel, het geven van een voorschot in contanten en, bij een geconfirmeerd crediet, de opening van een dergelijk crediet.   
(3).  Deze rechten op terugbetaling kunnen door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur naar zijn keuze worden uitgeoefend door toepassing op door een of meer van zijn Duitse debiteuren verschuldigde kortlopende credieten of gedeelten daarvan.   
(4).  Na elke dergelijke gebruikmaking kan de buitenlandse bankcrediteur de Duitse debiteur of debiteuren, ten opzichte van wier kortlopende credieten of gedeelten daarvan hij de bedoelde rechten op terugbetaling wil uitoefenen, een desbetreffende mededeling doen toekomen; een doorslag van deze mededeling moet gelijktijdig door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, met bijzonderheden over het nieuwe crediet en de gebruikmaking daarvan, toegezonden worden aan de Bank Deutscher Länder. De desbetreffende Duitse debiteur moet zo snel mogelijk door bemiddeling van de Bank Deutscher Länder zorg dragen voor de definitieve terugbetaling in buitenlandse valuta van het in de mededeling van de crediteur vermelde bedrag.   
(5).  De bepalingen van de leden (5), (6) en (7) van artikel 5 van deze overeenkomst gelden mutatis mutandis als in dit artikel geïncorporeerd.   
(6).  Laat een Duitse debiteur na een vordering tot terugbetaling binnen redelijke tijd op te volgen, dan heeft de buitenlandse bankcrediteur het recht om het desbetreffende recht op terugbetaling of gedeelten daarvan in overeenstemming met de voorgaande bepalingen uit te oefenen op andere kortlopende credieten.   

### 10  

####Terugbetaling in Duitse valuta

(1).  Iedere Duitse debiteur kan op verzoek van zijn buitenlandse bank-crediteur terugbetaling van een bepaald kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan overeenkomen in Duitse valuta - overeenkomstig de hierna volgende bepalingen omgerekend - en wel in dezelfde mate als waarin de betrokken Duitse debiteur op 24 Mei 1952 een dergelijke terugbetaling vrijwillig had kunnen doen krachtens de aan de Bank Deutscher Länder gerichte richtlijnen (50) 6 van de Geallieerde banken-commissie van 26 Juni 1950.   
(2).  De omrekening van buitenlandse valuta in Duitse valuta geschiedt tegen de officiële middenkoers geldend in de Bondsrepubliek op de werkdag vóór de dag waarop de betaling in Duitse valuta plaats vindt.   
(3).  Iedere dergelijke betaling betekent, na aanvaarding door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, een definitieve terugbetaling van het bedrag in buitenlandse valuta van het kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte van het kortlopend crediet, omgerekend op basis van de omrekeningsvoet bedoeld in lid (2) van dit artikel.   
(4).  Tegoeden in Duitse valuta, ontstaan uit terugbetalingen van kortlopende credieten overeenkomstig dit artikel of overeenkomstig artikel 11a, zullen kunnen worden gebruikt en zullen overdraagbaar zijn, voorzover zulks het geval is krachtens bepalingen van de Geallieerde wetten, verordeningen, richtlijnen en vergunningen (met inbegrip van door de Bank Deutscher Länder verleende algemene en speciale vergunningen), die op 24 Mei 1952 in de Bondsrepubliek van kracht waren, of voorzover overige bepalingen van de Bank Deutscher Länder zulks toelaten. Echter mag geen voorschrift van de Bank Deutscher Länder met betrekking tot de overdracht en de aanwending van tegoeden in Duitse valuta, voorzover het buitenlandse banken-crediteuren betreft een ongunstiger resultaat voor deze crediteuren hebben of hun rechten meer beperken dan bedoelde wetten, verordeningen, richtlijnen en vergunningen.   

### 11  

####Provisies en renten

Vanaf het tijdstip van het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst moeten alle provisies en disconto-kosten, binnen het kader van het gewone bankgebruik evenals zegels op wissels vooruit, en rente maandelijks worden voldaan in de valuta waarin het desbetreffende crediet loopt. Het is gewenst dat de berekening van provisies en renten gehouden wordt binnen redelijke grenzen, die aangepast zijn aan de omstandigheden; zou over de hoogte hiervan een meningsverschil ontstaan tussen een buitenlandse bank-crediteur en een Duitse debiteur, dan kan de kwestie voorgelegd worden aan de onderscheidene Centrale Banken.  

### 11a  

####Achterstallige renten

Rente op kortlopende credieten wordt op de voet van 4 % berekend over de tijd vanaf de dag der laatste betaling van de rente aan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur of vanaf de dag van het aflopen van de laatste der vroegere, hierop van toepassing zijnde overeenkomsten (steeds vanaf de laatste datum) tot aan de dag van de totstandkoming van deze overeenkomst. Naar keuze van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur zullen zij 

(i) hetzij vanaf het tijdstip van de totstandkoming van deze overeenkomst toegevoegd worden aan de hoofdsom van het desbetreffende kortlopende crediet en zullen dan met betrekking tot het toetreden tot deze overeenkomst en met betrekking tot alle andere doeleinden van deze overeenkomst een deel vormen van het kortlopende crediet,  

(ii) of worden uitgesteld en in de desbetreffende buitenlandse valuta vervallen bij de beëindiging van deze overeenkomst, onverminderd echter dat te allen tijde vóór die beëindiging aan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, overeenkomstig artikel 10 van deze overeenkomst, het totaal der uitgestelde rente of een gedeelte daarvan in Duitse mark betaald kan worden (omgerekend tegen de officiële middenkoers geldend in de Bondsrepubliek één werkdag voor die der betaling).   Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur moet gelijktijdig met het toezenden van zijn verklaring van toetreding aan zijn Duitse debiteur mededelen, welke van deze opties hij wenst toe te passen; indien dit niet geschiedt, zal de crediteur geacht worden van zijn optierecht (i) gebruik te hebben gemaakt.  

### 12  

####Evenredige verdeling van de betalingen en het als zekerheid gestelde door de Duitse banken

(1).  Indien een Duitse debiteur, die zowel een schuld heeft aan een buitenlandse bank-crediteur als aan een Duitse bank-debiteur, gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst of binnen 3 maanden na afloop van die looptijd insolvent geworden is, of heeft verzocht om opening van een schikkingsprocedure of heeft getracht tot een andere regeling van soortgelijke aard te komen met alle of enkele van zijn crediteuren, of failliet is verklaard, dan is de Duitse bankdebiteur gehouden om alle terugbetalingen, die hij van de Duitse debiteur heeft ontvangen gedurende de laatste 4 maanden voordat een dergelijk feit zich voordoet, evenals al het tot zekerheid strekkende (waaronder mede begrepen garanties en borgtochten), dat hij gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst van hem heeft verkregen, ponds-pondsgewijze met de buitenlandse bank-crediteur te verdelen.   
(2).  De faillissementscurator, iedere Duitse persoon, die belast is met het uitvoeren van de schikking of de regeling van hogerbedoelde aard, alsmede de Duitse bank-debiteur, zijn gehouden alle belanghebbende buitenlandse banken-crediteuren volledige inlichtingen te verstrekken aangaande hogerbedoelde terugbetalingen en zekerheidsstellingen.   

### 13  

####Instandhouding van de aansprakelijkheid van garanten, borgen enz.

(1).  Geen garant, borg, endossant of verzekeraar van een crediet in de Bondsrepubliek zal met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet van zijn verplichtingen, die voortvloeien uit de garantie, het zijn van borg, het endossement of de verzekering ontheven zijn omdat krachtens deze overeenkomst of ten gevolge daarvan een uitstel of een wijziging in de vorm van het kortlopende crediet of een deel daarvan (met inbegrip van de wijziging bedoeld in artikel 19 van deze overeenkomst) is gekomen. Evenmin zal degene, die in de Bondsrepubliek voor een kortlopend crediet onvoorwaardelijk of voorwaardelijk als debiteur aansprakelijk is, bevrijd worden door het feit dat een derde een gedeeltelijke betaling doet op het desbetreffende crediet, of door het feit dat krachtens deze overeenkomst of tengevolge daarvan een wijziging in de vorm van het kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan komt. Indien de verplichting van een Duitse debiteur gegarandeerd is of verzekerd door een garant, borg of credietverzekeraar buiten de Bondsrepubliek, die zich met het uitstel of met een wijziging in de vorm van de verplichting niet accoord verklaart, dan zullen de voordelen voortvloeiend uit deze overeenkomst de Duitse debiteur niet toekomen.   
(2).  Indien een lid van een firma, die een Duitse bank-debiteur of een Duitse handels- of industriële debiteur is, tijdens de looptijd van deze overeenkomst ophoudt lid te zijn door overlijden of op enige andere grond, dan geldt iedere verplichting, voortvloeiende uit een overeenkomstig deze overeenkomst lopend kortlopend crediet als een verplichting die ten tijde van dat ophouden bestond. De persoonlijke aansprakelijkheid van een dergelijke persoon of, in geval van zijn overlijden, de aansprakelijkheid van zijn nalatenschap voor verplichtingen van de firma, die bestonden op het tijdstip van dat ophouden, zal zich uitstrekken tot iedere verplichting voortvloeiend uit een dergelijk kortlopend crediet, zolang dat overeenkomstig deze overeenkomst in stand wordt gehouden.   

### 14  

####Faillissement, insolventie of contractbreuk; voorts de gevolgen voor een Duitse debiteur van het verlies der voordelen uit hoofde van deze overeenkomst

(1).  Indien te eniger tijd gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst een Duitse debiteur failliet gaat of insolvent wordt, dan verliest hij terstond, zonder meer alle rechten en voordelen uit hoofde van deze overeenkomst. Indien een buitenlandse bank-crediteur gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst stelt, dat een Duitse debiteur insolvent is geworden, en indien deze bewering wordt bestreden, dan heeft elke partij het recht het geschil ter beslissing voor te leggen aan de Arbitrage-commissie. Tot aan de beslissing van bedoelde Arbitrage-commissie dient de buitenlandse bank-crediteur zich van iedere maatregel tegen de Duitse debiteur te onthouden.   
(2).  Indien een Duitse debiteur gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst bij de bevoegde rechterlijke instantie een aanvraag indient tot opening van een schikkingsprocedure of tracht te komen tot een regeling van soortgelijke aard met alle of enkele van zijn crediteuren dan kan iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur van deze debiteur te allen tijde voor het verbindend verklaren van de schikking of een andere regeling door de bevoegde rechterlijke instantie aan de desbetreffende debiteur doen weten dat hij deze overeenkomst tussen hem en de crediteur opzegt met het gevolg, dat de debiteur daardoor de rechten en voordelen uit deze overeenkomst verliest.   
(3).  Indien te eniger tijd gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst een buitenlandse bank-crediteur stelt, dat een Duitse debiteur inbreuk heeft gemaakt op enigerlei bepaling van deze overeenkomst en dat hij heeft nagelaten, hoewel daartoe uitgenodigd deze inbreuk goed te maken binnen 2 weken na ontvangst van de formele mededeling van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur, dan kan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan de Arbitragecommissie. Gebeurt dit, dan mag, tot aan de beslissing van de Arbitrage-commissie geen der partijen enigerlei stappen in zulk een zaak ondernemen. Indien de uitspraak van de Arbitrage-commissie ten nadele van de Duitse debiteur luidt en deze nalaat aan de uitspraak binnen 2 weken na de bekendmaking daarvan te voldoen dan verliest hij zonder meer alle rechten of voordelen uit hoofde van deze overeenkomst met betrekking tot het door de desbetreffende buitenlandse bank-crediteur te zijner beschikking gehouden kortlopende crediet.   
(4).  Indien een Duitse debiteur te eniger tijd zijn rechten of voordelen uit hoofde van deze overeenkomst op grond van enigerlei bepaling van het voorgaande lid van dit artikel verliest dan worden bij het begin van de faillissements- of schikkingsprocedure, bij het intreden der insolventie of van andere regelingen van soortgelijke aard met alle of enkele van zijn crediteuren, zijn verplichtingen tegenover al zijn buitenlandse banken-crediteuren, of in geval van een inbreuk op het contract zijn verplichtingen tegenover de door deze inbreuk getroffen buitenlandse bank-crediteur, terstond opeisbaar en betaalbaar en het staat vervolgens de in aanmerking komende buitenlandse bank(en)-crediteur(en) vrij een vervolging te doen instellen en een vonnis te doen voltrekken met betrekking tot hun rechten tegenover de Duitse debiteur, alsmede van alle rechtsmiddelen gebruik te maken die te hunner beschikking zouden staan indien zij woonachtig waren in de Bondsrepubliek.   
(5).  Het feit dat een Duitse debiteur de voordelen uit deze overeenkomst heeft verloren laat de rechten van een derde, die ten tijde van dat verlies bestonden, onaangetast; met name blijven de rechten onaangetast van zijn buitenlandse bank-crediteur tegenover de Deutsche Golddiskontbank met betrekking tot een garantie voor kortlopende credieten, waarvoor de desbetreffende debiteur aansprakelijk was.   
(6).  Indien een Duitse debiteur te eniger tijd om enigerlei andere reden dan het openen van een gerechtelijke schikkingsprocedure de rechten of voordelen uit hoofde van deze overeenkomst verliest op grond van een krachtens lid (2) van dit artikel plaatsgevonden hebbende opzegging verliest, dan zijn de bepalingen van artikel 16 van deze overeenkomst niet van toepassing op de verplichtingen van de debiteur met betrekking tot de desbetreffende schuld.   

### 15  

####Instandhouding van credieten voor langere periodes

Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur kan met zijn Duitse debiteur regelingen treffen over de instandhouding van zijn kortlopende credieten of enige daarvan voor een langere periode dan in artikel 2 van deze overeenkomst is voorzien of wel over de vervanging van deze credieten door andere, die voor een langere periode dan voorzien in genoemd artikel in stand zullen worden gehouden. Wordt een dergelijke regeling getroffen dan zullen, nadat de toestemming van de Bank Deutscher Länder verkregen is, de aldus verlengde of vervangen kortlopende credieten ophouden onderworpen te zijn aan deze overeenkomst.  

### 16  

####Verstrekking van vreemde valuta's

De Bank Deutscher Länder verplicht zich te allen tijde gedurende de looptijd van deze overeenkomst de vreemde valuta's te verstrekken die nodig zijn om aan de Duitse debiteur het nakomen van zijn verplichtingen, die voortvloeien uit deze overeenkomst, mogelijk te maken en voor welke de verstrekking van vreemde valuta's noodzakelijk is.  

### 17  

####Raadgevend Comité

(1).  Teneinde periodiek met de Duitse Commissie en met de Bank Deutscher Länder overleg te plegen en teneinde de buitenlandse banken-comité's op de hoogte te houden van vragen, die zich gedurende de looptijd van de overeenkomst voordoen en tevens teneinde verdere met de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst in overeenstemming zijnde plichten waar te nemen die het, hetzij door de overeenkomst zelf of door de buitenlandse banken-comité's worden toegewezen, kan te allen tijde door de voorzitter van het gezamenlijke comité van vertegenwoordigers van de buitenlandse banken-comité's een zitting worden bijeengeroepen van een raadgevend comité, dat bestaat uit afgevaardigden van de buitenlandse banken-comité's; hij moet zulk een zitting steeds dan bijeen roepen wanneer hem daarom wordt verzocht door het Duitse Comité of door een van de buitenlandse banken-comité's. Ieder buitenlands banken-comité, dat deze overeenkomst tekent is gerechtigd een afgevaardigde te benoemen. Iedere zitting die ingevolge of in overeenstemming met dit artikel is belegd kan door een mededeling van de voorzitter van vorenbedoeld gezamenlijk comité weder worden afgelast of uitgesteld.   
(2).  Behoudens de hiernavolgende bepalingen worden alle beslissingen van de afgevaardigden genomen door stemming van de aanwezige afgevaardigden, die een meerderheid van de buitenlandse banken-comité's moeten vertegenwoordigen, op voorwaarde, dat deze meerderheid der buitenlandse banken-comité's ten minste 50 % vertegenwoordigt van het nominale bedrag van de te dien tijde nog lopende kortlopende credieten.   
(3).  Het aldus aangewezen comité kan bij eenparigheid van stemmen van de bij een zitting tegenwoordige afgevaardigden en met de goedkeuring van het Duitse Comité de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst interpreteren en van geval tot geval wijzigen. Echter mag er geen wijziging worden aangebracht, die de rechten der partijen bij deze overeenkomst, of van hen die er toe toegetreden zijn, essentieel verandert. Het constateren door het aldus aangewezen comité en door het Duitse Comité, dat een dergelijke wijziging bedoelde rechten niet wezenlijk verandert is voor alle partijen bij de overeenkomst en voor degenen die ertoe toetreden bindend.   
(4).  Indien het te eniger tijd op grond van de dan in de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde wetten voor een buitenlandse bank-crediteur mogelijk is, de terugbetaling van een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan in Duitse valuta te vragen, dan kan het Raadgevend Comité bij eenparig besluit van de ter vergadering aanwezige afgevaardigden (of door schriftelijke toestemming van alle afgevaardigden zonder dat een officiële vergadering plaats heeft) de artikelen 10 en 11 *a* van deze overeenkomst zodanig wijzigen, dat de debiteur tot de desbetreffende betaling in Duitse valuta verplicht is, en wel indien en voorzover een buitenlandse bank-crediteur zulks verlangt, onder voorbehoud echter van eventueel in de Bondsrepubliek met betrekking tot dergelijke betalingen bestaande beperkingen. ledere dergelijke wijziging is bindend voor alle partijen bij deze overeenkomst en voor degenen, die daartoe toetreden.   

### 18  

####Beleggingen in Duitse valuta in het kader van vroegere overeenkomsten

Vanaf het tijdstip van het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst moeten renten en opbrengsten van beleggingen, verkregen met registermarktegoeden overeenkomstig artikel 10 van een der vroegere overeenkomsten, behandeld worden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 10 (5) (*g*) van de overeenkomst van 1939, op voorwaarde dat de voet, waartegen deze renten en opbrengsten worden getransfereerd, de rentevoet die op dat ogenblik voor kortlopende credieten betaald moet worden aan buitenlandse banken-crediteuren van hetzelfde crediteur-land, niet te boven gaat.  

### 19  

####Vervaltermijn van de credieten

Alle verplichtingen, die voortvloeien uit onder deze overeenkomst vallende kortlopende credieten worden opeisbaar en betaalbaar bij afloop of beëindiging van deze overeenkomst. De buitenlandse bankencrediteuren hebben dan het recht, de rekeningen van de Duitse debiteuren te belasten met een bedrag ter hoogte van alle voor rekening van deze Duitse debiteuren geaccepteerde wissels, ook dan, wanneer die wissels eerst later vervallen. Echter mogen renten slechts berekend worden vanaf de vervaldag der wissels. Met betrekking tot geconfirmeerde credieten heeft de buitenlandse bank-crediteur het recht het totaal-bedrag van alle wissels, die getrokken zijn op grond van zulk een crediet, voor afloop van deze overeenkomst, te debiteren als een werkelijke verplichting, ongeacht het feit, dat die wissels op bedoeld tijdstip nog niet voor acceptering waren gepresenteerd. Dat gedeelte van een geconfirmeerd crediet, waarvan nog geen gebruik gemaakt is kan worden gedebiteerd als een voorwaardelijke verplichting; echter mogen geen renten in rekening worden gebracht, voordat de wissels vervallen of voordat de buitenlandse bank-crediteur effectief voorschotten in contanten heeft gegeven in verband met een dergelijk crediet.  

### 20  

####Arbitrage

(1).  Eventuele geschillen, die tussen buitenlandse banken-crediteuren enerzijds en Duitse debiteuren of de Bank Deutscher Länder anderzijds ontstaan over de interpretatie van deze overeenkomst of over andere vragen, die voortvloeien uit deze overeenkomst moeten worden voorgelegd aan een Arbitrage-commissie, in te stellen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel. <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>   
(2).  De Arbitrage-commissie wordt als volgt ingesteld: 

(a) De Bank voor Internationale Betalingen benoemt 3 personen tot vaste leden van de Commissie; één daarvan wordt tot voorzitter van de Commissie, een tweede tot plv. voorzitter benoemd; laatstbedoelde heeft tot taak bij afwezigheid van de voorzitter de vergaderingen van de Commissie te leiden.  

(b) De Bank voor Internationale Betalingen benoemt bovendien nog 3 personen als plv. leden van de Arbitrage-commissie die, ter vervanging van één of meer der vaste leden, ter beschikking moeten staan voor het geval dat laatstbedoelde personen tijdelijk wegens ziekte of om andere redenen verhinderd zijn aan de zittingen van de Commissie deel te nemen. Hierbij moet bepaald worden ter vervanging van welke vaste leden de verschillende plaatsvervangende leden zullen optreden. Een plaatsvervangend lid mag aan de zittingen van de Commissie slechts deelnemen bij afwezigheid en als plaatsvervanger van het desbetreffende vaste lid.     
(3).  Het reglement van de Arbitrage-commissie moet o.m. de volgende voorschriften bevatten: 

(a) De ondertekenaars van deze overeenkomst (d.w.z. de buitenlandse banken-comité's, het Duitse Comité en de Bank Deutscher Länder) moeten ten minste 10 dagen vóór de behandeling in kennis gesteld worden van de dagen waarop de behandeling van een vraag, die aan de Arbitrage-commissie door een der ondertekenaars is voorgelegd, zal plaats vinden, en iedere ondertekenaar heeft de rechten van een partij in het proces, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de volgende paragraaf.  

(b) Alle bij een aan de Arbitrage-commissie voorgelegd geschil belanghebbende partijen hebben het recht zich bij de behandeling te laten vertegenwoordigen door een vertegenwoordiger, een advocaat of een andere gevolmachtigde en om hun argumenten pro of contra de vraag die behandeld moet worden, schriftelijk voor te leggen overeenkomstig de procedure die door de Arbitrage-commissie wordt voorgeschreven.  

(c) De Arbitrage-commissie moet van geval tot geval de tijdstippen waarop en de plaatsen waar de zittingen zullen plaats vinden, vaststellen en alle ondertekenaars van deze overeenkomst daarvan tijdig in kennis stellen.  

(d) De Arbitrage-commissie moet in het kort schriftelijk de overwegingen uiteenzetten van iedere genomen beslissing, onverschillig of deze al dan niet met eenparigheid van stemmen is genomen. Deze overwegingen kunnen, indien daartoe met algemene stemmen door de Commissie wordt besloten, achterwege blijven, tenzij een der partijen voor de behandeling om schriftelijke vastlegging van de overwegingen heeft verzocht. Worden geen schriftelijke overwegingen gegeven, dan moet in de beslissing worden vastgelegd, dat de Commissie met algemene stemmen een desbetreffend besluit genomen heeft en dat geen der partijen een verzoek als hierboven bedoeld, heeft ingediend.  

(e) Indien de Arbitrage-commissie zich met betrekking tot de beslissing over een aan haar voorgelegd geschil niet competent verklaart of indien de bevoegde gewone rechterlijke instantie in het land van een der bij de procedure belanghebbende partijen zich onbevoegd acht op grond van het feit, dat de Commissie bevoegd zou zijn, of indien het geschil geheel of ten dele terugverwezen wordt naar de Commissie, dan moet in beide gevallen de Commissie over het geschil beslissen.     

### 21  

####Onkosten

De kosten en uitgaven die ontstaan en samenhangen met de voorbereiding, de toepassing en de uitvoering van deze overeenkomst komen, met inbegrip van de uitgaven die ontstaan zijn voor de buitenlandse banken-comité's voor rechtsbijstand of uit andere hoofde voor het tot stand komen van deze overeenkomst (doch niet vroeger dan 1 November 1950) en die ontstaan zijn gedurende de looptijd van de overeenkomst, ten laste van de Duitse debiteuren. Het Duitse Comité moet zorg dragen voor de betaling van al deze kosten, uitgaven en remuneraties.  

### 22  

####Toetreding

(1).  Toetreding tot deze overeenkomst wordt door iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur bewerkstelligd door zijn Duitse debiteur of debiteuren binnen 2 maanden na het van kracht worden van deze overeenkomst van zijn verklaring van toetreding in kennis te stellen door middel van een brief in duplo onder gebruikmaking van een model, dat verkrijgbaar is bij de buitenlandse banken-comité's in de desbetreffende buitenlandse crediteur-landen. In de brief moeten de kortlopende credieten, waarvoor de Duitse debiteur of debiteuren aansprakelijk zijn en waarop de toetreding betrekking heeft, in het kort worden aangegeven. ledere Duitse debiteur moet binnen 4 dagen na ontvangst van een verklaring van toetreding van een van zijn buitenlandse banken-crediteuren aan deze een brief toezenden waarin hij, onder gebruikmaking van een model, dat bij de Bank Deutscher Länder of een Landeszentralbank verkrijgbaar is, zijn toetreding bevestigt . De buitenlandse bank-crediteur kan van zijn toetreding ook per telegram mededeling doen, doch dan moet hij dit op de hierboven aangegeven wijze bevestigen. <sup> 1)  Zie Bijlage III *a*.  </sup>   
(2).  Iedere buitenlandse bank-crediteur die vroeger deelnam aan een konsortial Kredit, heeft het recht tot deze overeenkomst toe te treden in Verband met zijn deelneming.   
(3).  Na de toetreding worden de buitenlands bank-crediteur en de Duitse debiteur met betrekking tot de hierbedoelde kortlopende credieten partijen bij deze overeenkomst. Vanaf dat ogenblik hebben zij de rechten en krijgen zij de verplichtingen, bedoeld in deze overeenkomst voor de buitenlandse banken-crediteuren en voor de Duitse debiteuren.   
(4).  Elk buitenlands banken-comité kan met toestemming van het Duitse Comité de termijn verlengen, waarbinnen de afzonderlijke buitenlandse banken-crediteuren van het betrokken land toe kunnen treden tot de overeenkomst. Indien echter een persoon, een firma of een vennootschap in de Bondsrepubliek tijdens de looptijd van deze overeenkomst met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan aansprakelijk wordt bij wege van erfopvolging, of indien overeenkomstig artikel 5, artikel 7, of artikel 8 van deze overeenkomst nieuwe verklaringen van toetreding worden uitgewisseld, dan kan de toetreding met betrekking tot een dergelijk crediet of een deel van dat crediet plaatsvinden zonder vorenbedoelde toestemming, binnen redelijke tijd nadat de erfopvolging of een andere belangrijke gebeurtenis heeft plaatsgevonden.   
(5).  Indien een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan, hetwelk verleend is aan een bank-debiteur, die niet gevestigd is in de Bondsrepubliek of die door zijn buitenlandse bank-crediteur niet meer kan worden opgespoord of geïdentificeerd, en voor wie een cliënt van zulk een Duitse bank-debiteur die gewoonlijk gevestigd is in de Bondsrepubliek, eveneens aansprakelijk is, dan moet deze cliënt (op verlangen van de buitenlandse bank-crediteur) met betrekking tot een dergelijk crediet of een deel daarvan tot de overeenkomst toetreden; de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst zijn dan op dit crediet gelijkelijk van toepassing als indien het oorspronkelijk rechtstreeks aan de cliënt was verleend.   
(6).  Indien een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan, dat verleend is aan een handels- of industriële debiteur, die niet in de Bondsrepubliek gevestigd is, of die door zijn buitenlandse bankcrediteur niet meer kan worden opgespoord of geïdentificeerd, en met betrekking waartoe een in de Bondsrepubliek woonachtige persoon mede aansprakelijk is als garant, borg, endossant of crediet-verzekeraar, moet deze persoon op verlangen van de buitenlandse bankcrediteur, met betrekking tot een dergelijk crediet of een deel daarvan, tot deze overeenkomst toetreden; op dat crediet zijn dan de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst gelijkelijk van toepassing als indien het oorspronkelijk rechtstreeks aan dezelfde persoon was verleend.   
(7).  Indien een Duitse bank, handels- of industriële onderneming door erfopvolging hoofd-debiteur wordt van een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan krachtens of ingevolge een Duitse wet (bv. Durchführungsverordnung Nr 35 bij het Wahrungsgesetz Nr 63 of Gesetz über den Niederlassungsbereich von Kreditinstituten van 29 Maart 1952) dan kan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur ten aanzien van een dergelijke firma tot deze overeenkomst toetreden met betrekking tot een dergelijk crediet of een deel daarvan; de betrokken firma moet van haar zijde op de in de overeenkomst voorgeschreven wijze en met dienovereenkomstig effect haar toetreding bevestigen. Deze bepaling vindt ook toepassing in geval van erfopvolging terzake van een kortlopend crediet of een gedeelte daarvan, wanneer deze erfopvolging in overeenstemming is met de thans in de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde wetten (bv. artikel 7 (3) van de wet op het Niederlassungsbereich von Kreditinstituten van 29 Maart 1952). Door de toetreding van een Duitse debiteur-opvolger met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet of een deel daarvan houdt de desbetreffende toetreding van een Duitse crediteur-voorganger op van kracht te zijn en effect te hebben (tenzij in deze overeenkomst anders is bepaald).   
(8).  Zijn of worden op grond van de tegenwoordig in de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde wetten (bv. Durchführungsverordnung Nr 35 bij het Wahrungsgesetz Nr 63 of Gesetz über den Niederlassungsbereich von Kreditinstituten van 29 Maart 1952) een of meer bankinstellingen-opvolgers gezamenlijk met de oorspronkelijke Duitse bank-debiteur voor een schuld aansprakelijk met betrekking tot een kortlopend crediet of een deel daarvan, dan moeten (behoudens de bepalingen van de twee volgende alinea's) deze bankinstelling of deze bankinstellingen eveneens met betrekking tot een dergelijk crediet of een deel daarvan toetreden tot deze overeenkomst; in dit geval blijft echter de toetreding van de oorspronkelijke Duitse bankdebiteur ten volle van kracht.   
(9).  Indien een kortlopend crediet of een deel daarvan verleend is aan een Duitse bank-debiteur, en indien met betrekking daarop eveneens een buiten het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek woonachtige cliënt van deze bank-debiteur aansprakelijk is, dan is noch de Duitse bank-debiteur noch enige andere bankinstelling die gezamenlijk met de desbetreffende debiteur aansprakelijk is, verplicht om enigerlei maatregel, op grond van de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst, te treffen met betrekking tot dit crediet of een gedeelte daarvan (afgezien van de toetreding als erkenning van het bestaan en het bedrag van het crediet of een gedeelte daarvan), voorzover en tot zolang niet de buitenlandse bank-crediteur ook zonder deze overeenkomst gerechtigd was om in de Bondsrepubliek de betaling van de desbetreffende schuld naar Duits recht af te dwingen.   
(10).  Indien een kortlopend crediet, voortvloeiend uit een oorspronkelijk voorschot in contanten, niet omgezet is in een acceptcrediet, en de betaling daarvan door de buitenlandse bank-crediteur (op grond van de tegenwoordig in de Bondsrepubliek van kracht zijnde wetten, bv. de Durchführungsverordnung Nr 35 bij het Urnstellungsgesetz Nr 63 of artikel 7 (2) van het „Gesetz über den Niederlassungsbereich von Kreditinstituten” van 29 Maart 1952) binnen de Bondsrepubliek slechts tot een evenredig deel kan worden afgedwongen dan zijn de Duitse bank-debiteur en iedere bankinstelling, die mede aansprakelijk is met hem, niet verplicht, op grond van de bepalingen van deze overeenkomst met betrekking tot het aandeel, waarvan de buitenlandse bank-crediteur op het ogenblik de betaling niet kan afdwingen, maatregelen te nemen, buiten de toetreding als erkenning van het bestaan en het bedrag van het crediet, zolang niet de buitenlandse bank-crediteur ook zonder deze overeenkomst gerechtigd zou zijn, in de Bondsrepubliek de betaling van de desbetreffende schuld naar Duits recht af te dwingen.   

### 23  

####Deutsche Golddiskontbank

(1).  Geen der bepalingen van deze overeenkomst zal de verplichtingen van de Deutsche Golddiskontbank of de rechten van een buitenlandse bank-crediteur tegen haar beperken, zoals deze rechten zijn vastgelegd of vervat in de laatste vroegere overeenkomst, die van toepassing is op een bepaald kortlopend crediet; artikel 23 van de overeenkomst van 1939 moet worden geacht te zijn geïnsereerd in deze overeenkomst (met ingang van de dag waarop zij tot stand komt); echter moeten in de tekst van dat artikel de volgende wijzigingen worden aangebracht: 

(a) Lid 3 van dat artikel zal zo moeten worden gewijzigd, dat de woorden „deze overeenkomst” in lid 5 (*h*) van artikel 23 van de overeenkomst van 1933 worden vervangen door de woorden „één van de vroegere overeenkomsten”.  

(b) Lid 4 van dat artikel moet zo worden gewijzigd dat de woorden „artikel 23 van de overeenkomsten van 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 en 1938” vervangen worden door de woorden „artikel 23 van een vroegere overeenkomst”.  

(c) De leden 5 en 7 moeten worden geschrapt.     
(2).  De liquidateur van de Deutsche Golddiskontbank aanvaardt door ondertekening van deze overeenkomst de bepaling van lid 1 van dit artikel. Tevens erkent hij ten aanzien van iedere afzonderlijke buitenlandse bank-crediteur, die een kortlopend crediet of een deel van een kortlopend crediet heeft, waarvan de betaling tot nog toe gegarandeerd werd door de Deutsche Golddiskontbank, en met betrekking waartoe de toetreding tot deze overeenkomst plaats vindt, dat de aansprakelijkheid uit hoofde van deze garantie ten volle van kracht blijft voorzover het desbetreffende crediet of een gedeelte daarvan nog niet betaald of gedelgd is.   

### 24  

####Betalingen die een andere oorsprong hebben

Indien een buitenlandse bank-crediteur na tot deze overeenkomst te zijn toegetreden, met betrekking tot enigerlei lopende schuld van een debiteur binnen het gebied, dat op 31 December 1937 tot het Duitse Rijk behoorde, betaling aanneemt van enig geldbedrag uit een andere bron als die van bedoelde debiteur, en indien hij dat bedrag volgens de wet of om andere redenen of ingevolge zijn eigen wens moet verrekenen met kortlopende credieten, die onder deze overeenkomst vallen, dan zal de buitenlandse bank-crediteur deze gelden aanwenden ter definitieve terugbetaling van de schuld uit hoofde van het kortlopende crediet of eventueel voor de kortlopende credieten met betrekking waartoe hij het bedrag heeft ontvangen; heeft hij het bedrag niet ontvangen met betrekking tot een bepaald kortlopend crediet of bepaalde kortlopende credieten, dan moet de buitenlandse bank-crediteur het bedrag verrekenen met kortlopende credieten, die hij zelf aanwijst tenzij de buitenlandse bank-crediteur nog andere credieten van bedoelde soort (mits geen kortlopende credieten) ter beschikking houdt, waartegen hij de gelden van rechtswege kan verrekenen en naar zijn keuze verrekent. Onmiddellijk na de besteding van deze gelden ter reductie van een of meerdere kortlopende credieten moet de buitenlandse bank-crediteur daarvan mededeling doen aan de belanghebbende Duitse debiteur resp. de belanghebbende Duitse debiteuren en aan het Duitse Comité alsmede aan zijn eigen buitenlandse banken-comité; de schuld met betrekking tot het kortlopende crediet of de kortlopende credieten, waartegen deze gelden aldus zijn verrekend, is daarna definitief terugbetaald.  

### 25  

####Ondertekening en verkorte titel van deze overeenkomst

De originelen van deze overeenkomst, voorzien van de handtekeningen van het Duitse Comité, van de Bank Deutscher Länder en van de desbetreffende buitenlandse banken-comité's moeten door bemiddeling van de desbetreffende Centrale Banken ter goede bewaring voor alle belanghebbende partijen worden toegezonden aan de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen.   
(2).  De onderhavige overeenkomst kan worden aangehaald als „DE DUITSE CREDIETOVEREENKOMST VAN 1952”.

### *De Duitse Credietovereenkomst van 1952* 

*19 Februari 1953.*  Mijne Heren, Wij refereren aan de verklaringen afgegeven door de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden namens de in die Commissie vertegenwoordigde Regeringen, zomede van de Duitse delegatie in naam van de Bondsrepubliek, ingevolge welke hun Regeringen bereid zijn om door geëigende administratieve maatregelen in Duitsland, de Duitse Credietovereenkomst van 1952 (vervat in Bijlage III bij de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden, en hierna genoemd: de overeenkomst van 1952) in werking te laten treden bij de ratificering van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland; echter moeten de in de overeenkomst van 1952 voorziene betalingen in buitenlandse valuta, afgezien van die betalingen, welke normaal voortvloeien uit artikel 5 van bedoelde overeenkomst, worden opgeschort tot de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hierna genoemd „intergouvernementele overeenkomst”) overeenkomstig Artikel 35 daarvan in werking treedt. Wij refereren voorts aan de volgens de overeenkomst van 1952 tussen crediteuren en debiteuren onder bepaalde voorwaarden uit te wisselen formulieren voor verklaringen van toetreding; in bedoelde verklaringen van toetreding van 1952 wordt o.m. gerefereerd aan de hogerbedoelde opschorting van betalingen in vreemde valuta krachtens deze overeenkomst. De debiteuren verklaren ermede accoord te gaan, dat zij, zodra de overeenkomst van 1952 integraal in werking treedt, overeenkomstig hogerbedoelde intergouvernementele overeenkomst terstond aan de crediteuren alle betalingen in vreemde valuta's ingevolge de overeenkomst van 1952 zullen doen, die in de tussentijd opgeschort zijn. Wij verklaren ermede accoord te gaan dat de overeenkomst van 1952 in werking zal treden nadat aan de bepalingen van artikel 29 van de overeenkomst zal zijn voldaan, en na ratificering van genoemde intergouvernementele overeenkomst door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, doch dat zij buiten werking treedt, wanneer zij niet bij het in werking treden van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst in deze wordt begrepen. Derhalve moet artikel 2 van de overeenkomst van 1952 zo worden verstaan alsof de dag, waarop aan de bepalingen van artikel 29 van deze overeenkomst is voldaan en waarop de ratificering van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is geschied is bedoeld als de dag waarop de bepalingen van de overeenkomst van 1952 in werking zullen treden. Voorts bevestigen wij dat wij indien de overeenkomst van 1952 bij het inwerking treden van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst overeenkomstig Artikel 35 daarin wordt begrepen, alles wat in ons vermogen ligt zullen doen om onverwijlde betaling aan de crediteuren van alle in buitenlandse valuta luidende betalingen te doen, overeenkomstig de overeenkomst van 1952, welke in de tussentijd zijn opgeschort. Wij bevestigen dat ingevolge de wens van de partijen bij de overeenkomst van 1952 de volgende veranderingen in de tekst van deze overeenkomst, zoals weergegeven in bijlage 5 van het eindrapport van de conferentie over Duitse buitenlandse schulden moeten worden aangebracht en moeten worden opgenomen in de te ondertekenen tekst van de overeenkomst: *Lid 7 van de inleiding.* De woorden „door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek of een andere bevoegde overheidsinstantie” moeten worden vervangen door de woorden „door de bevoegde regeringsautoriteiten van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en Berlijn (West)”. Het woord „en” moet worden bijgevoegd achter paragraaf (ii), datzelfde woord moet aan het slot van paragraaf (iii) worden geschrapt. Aan het begin van paragraaf (iv) moeten worden ingevoegd de woorden „en moeten zoveel mogelijk zekerheid geven dat”. *Artikel 1. Definities.* De woorden ,,en wordt gebruikt ter aanduiding van het gebied en niet van de regeringsbevoegdheid” moeten aan het slot van de definitie van het woord „Bondsrepubliek” worden toegevoegd. *Artikel 20. Arbitrage.* In lid 1 moeten de woorden „die zijn toegetreden tot deze overeenkomst” worden ingevoegd achter de woorden „Duitse debiteuren”. *Artikel 22. Toetreding.* In lid 1 moeten de woorden „zijn toetreding bevestigt” worden vervangen door „zijn toetreding tot deze overeenkomst bevestigt en zich op verlangen van de crediteur bereid verklaard tot iedere door het Duitse Comité en de Bank Deutscher Länder ondertekende overeenkomst voor vernieuwing of verlenging toe te treden”. Het ondergetekende Duitse Comité verklaart hiermede, overeenkomstig artikel 22 (4) van de overeenkomst van 1952 ermede accoord te gaan, dat Uwe comité's de termijn, waarbinnen buitenlandse banken-crediteuren in Uw land kunnen toetreden tot de overeenkomst van 1952, verlengen, teneinde toetreding binnen twee maanden na het van kracht worden van meergenoemde intergouvernementele overeenkomst mogelijk te maken. Met de meeste hoogachting, enz. Voor het Duitse Comité voor Stillhalteschulden, (ondertekend) Voor de Bank deutscher Länder, (ondertekend) Aan het Duitse Comité voor Stillhalteschulden en aan de Bank deutscher Länder. 
### *De Duitse Credietovereenkomst van 1952* 

*20 Februari 1953.*  Mijne Heren, Wij bevestigen hiermede de ontvangst van Uw schrijven inzake de maatregelen met het oog op de inwerkingtreding van hogergenoemde overeenkomst en de in die overeenkomst voorziene tijdelijke opschorting van betalingen in vreemde valuta's aan de crediteuren, met uitzondering van de normaal uit artikel 5 van de overeenkomst voortvloeiende betalingen en bevestigen tevens dat wij de in Uw schrijven uiteengezette bepalingen en voorwaarden accepteren. Met name gaan wij ermede accoord 

(a) dat de overeenkomst van 1952 in werking zal treden nadat aan de bepalingen van artikel 29 van de overeenkomst zal zijn voldaan, en na ratificering van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hiena te noemen „intergouvernementele overeenkomst”) door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, doch dat zij buiten werking treedt, wanneer zij niet bij het in werking treden van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst in deze wordt begrepen;  

(b) dat alle in de overeenkomst van 1952 voorziene betalingen in buitenlandse valuta's, afgezien van die betalingen, welke normaal voortvloeien uit artikel 5 van de overeenkomst, worden opgeschort tot de intergouvernementele overeenkomst, overeenkomstig Artikel 35 daarvan in werking treedt; en  

(c) dat de in Uw brief vermelde wijzigingen in de tekst van de overeenkomst van 1952 opgenomen behoren te worden in het te ondertekenen exemplaar van de overeenkomst.   Dit schrijven kan in meerdere exemplaren worden vervaardigd die alle geacht moeten worden hetzelfde stuk te zijn. Met de meeste hoogachting, (ondertekend) voor het Amerikaanse Comité van Stillhaltecrediteuren van Duitsland. (ondertekend) voor het Engelse banken-comité voor Duitse Zaken.

Opbrengsten voor 8 Mei 1945 ten gunste van buitenlandse crediteuren uit investeringen in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of Berlijn (West), voor zover deze opbrengsten niet in een andere Bijlage van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden of in deze zelf behandeld worden. Het betreft hier met name: 

(1) dividenden op aandelen, die binnen de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of Berlijn (West) zijn uitgegeven;  

(2) winsten;  

(3) huren en pachten.    

### Artikel  4  

Geldvorderingen, ontstaan voor 8 Mei 1945, die niet zijn genoemd in andere Bijlagen van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden, of in de artikelen 1 tot en met 3 van dit voorstel voor een regeling, doch die naar hun aard behoren onder dit voorstel voor een regeling.  

### Artikel  5  

####Uitzonderingen

Van deze regeling zijn voorlopig uitgesloten vorderingen op de stad Berlijn en op openbare nutsbedrijven, in Berlijn gelegen of door Berlijn gecontroleerd.  

### Hoofdstuk  B  

####Algemene Beginselen

### Artikel  6  

####Omzetting in Duitse mark

(1).  Vorderingen, luidende in Rijksmark worden geregeld, nadat de buitenlandse crediteur er zijn goedkeuring aan heeft gehecht, dat zijn vordering in dezelfde verhouding in D. mark wordt omgezet als een dergelijke vordering van een binnenlandse crediteur. Dit is ook van toepassing op geldvorderingen, die in goudmark of Rijksmark met goud-clausule luiden, doch geen specifiek buitenlands karakter in de zin van het volgende lid (2) hebben. De Duitse deviezenautoriteiten zullen voortaan de nodige goedkeuring verlenen voor een omzetting volgens de Wet op de Munthervorming (Umstellungsgesetz), of voor een nieuwe vaststelling volgens de wetgeving op balansen in D. mark, voor zover de crediteur recht heeft op de omzetting of nieuwe vaststelling.   
(2).  Overeengekomen is, dat dergelijke in goudmarken of Rijksmarken met goud-clausule uitgedrukte geldvorderingen uit kapitaalverkeer en hypotheken, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen, zullen worden omgerekend in D. mark in de verhouding 1 : 1. De definitie van de criteria voor het begrip „specifiek buitenlands karakter” bij dergelijke geldvorderingen zal het onderwerp vormen van verdere onderhandelingen (zie Bijlage VII). Beide partijen behouden zich het recht voor, hun houding nader te bepalen ten aanzien van de vraag, in welke gevallen en op welke wijze het bovenbedoelde principe kan worden toegepast. Aan de Duitse delegatie wordt overgelaten te beslissen, op welke wijze de oplossing, die zal worden gevonden, kan worden gevoegd in het kader van de Duitse wetgeving inzake de munthervorming en inzake de „Kriegs- und Nachkriegs-Lastenausgleich”. Bovenbedoelde onderhandelingen tussen een Duitse delegatie en vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren zullen niet later dan 31 October 1952 plaats vinden.   

### Artikel  7  

####Vorderingen in vreemde valuta met goud-clausule

Voor de regeling van deze vorderingen zullen de volgende beginselen mutatis mutandis worden toegepast: Schulden, luidende in goud-dollars of in Zwitserse goud-francs, worden omgerekend op basis van 1 goud-dollar = 1 U.S. dollar en 1 Zwitserse goud-franc = 1 Zwitserse franc. De nieuwe overeenkomsten luiden in courante U.S.-dollars of Zwitserse francs. Andere schulden met goud-clausules (uitgezonderd in Duitse valuta luidende schulden met goud-clausules - zie artikel 6, lid 2) zijn alleen betaalbaar in de valuta van het land, waar de lening opgenomen is of de uitgifte heeft plaats gevonden (verder genoemd valuta van uitgifte). Het verschuldigde bedrag zal worden berekend als de tegenwaarde van een bedrag in U.S.-dollars volgens de wisselkoers, geldend op het tijdstip, waarop het bedrag betaald moet worden. Dit dollarbedrag wordt verkregen door het nominale bedrag om te rekenen in U.S.-dollars tegen de wisselkoers, geldend op het tijdstip van de opneming of uitgifte van de lening. Het aldus berekende bedrag in de valuta van uitgifte mag echter niet lager zijn dan wanneer het zou zijn berekend volgens de wisselkoers, geldend op 1 Augustus 1952.  

### Artikel  8  

####Omrekening van vorderingen in vreemde valuta in Duitse mark

Vorderingen in vreemde valuta zullen worden omgerekend in D. mark op basis van de pariteiten, geldend op de dag voor de betaling, zoals medegedeeld aan het Internationale Monetaire Fonds. Wanneer geen pariteit is vastgesteld, volgt omrekening tegen de middenkoers van de Bank Deutscher Länder op de dag voor de betaling.  

### Artikel  9  

####Konversionskasse für Deutsche Auslandsschulden

I.  De Duitse delegatie was van mening, dat de Duitse debiteur tot het totale bedrag van zijn betalingen aan de Konversionskasse definitief van zijn schuld bevrijd was. De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren waren evenwel van mening, dat als regel zulke betalingen aan de Konversionskasse volgens het in hun land geldend recht niet als bevrijdend voor de Duitse debiteur erkend zouden worden. In het verlangen, een einde te maken aan vruchteloze juridische discussies, zijn beide partijen overeengekomen een practische oplossing te zoeken, welke het mogelijk zal maken de aanspraken zonder onnodige formaliteiten te regelen. De Duitse delegatie en de vertegenwoordigers van buitenlandse crediteuren zijn derhalve, onder handhaving van hun juridische standpunten, het volgende overeengekomen: 

(1) De Duitse debiteur verplicht zich de vordering van de crediteur volgens de nieuwe voorwaarden van de regeling te betalen, ongeacht de door hem aan de Konversionskasse gedane betalingen, voor zover de crediteur 

(a) van de Konversionskasse het bedrag, overeenkomende met het door de debiteur gestorte, niet werkelijk heeft ontvangen of  

(b) een betaling of prestatie van de Konversionskasse op grond van een betaling door de debiteur gedaan, heeft geweigerd, omdat de crediteur de betaling of prestatie niet als voldoening van de schuld wilde erkennen.   Bij effecten, waarop het „Bereinigungsgesetz für Deutsche Auslandsbonds” van toepassing is, zal deze regeling slechts betrekking hebben op die obligaties en coupons, welke erkend zijn op grond van die wet, en eventuele over de toepassing van die wet gesloten overeenkomsten met het land van emissie, of waarvoor de crediteur volgens die wet een declaratoire beslissing (Feststellungsbescheid) heeft gekregen.  

(2) De bedragen zullen uit de Duitse openbare kas aan de debiteuren worden vergoed.  

(3) Voor de betalingen aan de Konversionskasse gedaan, die niet vallen onder (1), is de debiteur van zijn schuld bevrijd.     
II.  Onder voorbehoud van de algemene bepalingen hierboven onder I bedoeld, wordt het volgende bepaald: 

(a) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland verbindt zich de aansprakelijkheid voor de volledige betaling in de verschuldigde valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren over te nemen voor die bedragen, die door debiteuren in het Saargebied in de Konversionskasse zijn gestort, en met betrekking tot welke de buitenlandse crediteuren noch betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen, noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(b) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland verbindt zich de aansprakelijkheid voor de betaling in de verschuldigde valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren over te nemen voor 60 % van die bedragen, die door debiteuren in Oostenrijk, Frankrijk, België en Luxemburg in de Konversionskasse zijn gestort, en met betrekking tot welke de buitenlandse crediteuren noch betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen, noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(c) De Bondsregering zal voor eind December 1952 met de vertegenwoordigers van buitenlandse crediteuren onderhandelingen beginnen met betrekking tot de uitvoering van deze verplichtingen.     

### Artikel  10  

####Betalingen bij de Deutsche Verrechnungskasse

De partijen bij de onderhandelingen hebben de stortingen, door de Duitse debiteuren gedaan bij de Deutsche Verrechnungskasse, welke niet zijn uitbetaald aan de crediteuren, besproken. In verband met de verscheidenheid van de overeenkomsten tussen Duitsland en de andere landen, welke nog afgewikkeld moeten worden, zijn crediteuren en debiteuren van mening, dat de nog niet opgeloste kwesties moeten worden opgelost door intergouvernementele onderhandelingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en de desbetreffende landen.  

### Artikel  11  

####Hardheidsclausule

Indien en voor zover de financiële positie van een debiteur door oorlog, oorlogsgevolgen of andere buitengewone omstandigheden zo is achteruitgegaan, dat de nakoming van zijn verplichtingen overeenkomstig de voorwaarden en binnen de termijnen, neergelegd in dit voorstel voor een regeling, van de debiteur niet kan worden gevergd, zullen hem faciliteiten worden verleend. Bij deze faciliteiten zal rekening worden gehouden met de billijkheid en de bijzondere omstandigheden van de debiteur. Zij zullen in overeenstemming zijn met de concessies, die de debiteur op dezelfde gronden volgens Duits recht, in het bijzonder volgens de wetgeving voor de hulp aan debiteuren (Vertragshilferecht), van een Duitse crediteur heeft verkregen of zou kunnen verkrijgen. Wanneer crediteuren en debiteuren niet tot overeenstemming komen, beslist het bevoegde Duitse gerecht. De crediteur kan tegen de gerechtelijke uitspraak in eerste instantie naar zijn keuze, of de hem naar Duits recht toekomende rechtsmiddelen aanwenden, of binnen een periode van dertig dagen na de betekening van de uitspraak in eerste instantie, zich wenden tot het volgens artikel 17 gevormde scheidsgerecht. De beslissing van het scheidsgerecht is bindend.  

### Artikel  12  

####Rechtsopvolging ten aanzien van vorderingen en schulden

(1).  Wanneer een buitenlandse crediteur vorderingen van een andere buitenlandse crediteur door erfopvolging heeft verkregen of in de toekomst verkrijgt, wordt zulk een vordering in het kader van dit voorstel voor een regeling behandeld, alsof de oorspronkelijke crediteur er nog toe gerechtigd was. Hetzelfde geldt voor analoge gevallen van rechtsopvolging op grond van de wet.   
(2).  Als rechtsopvolger van de debiteur is aansprakelijk degene, die volgens een wet of bindende verordening de schuld moet overnemen of volgens overeenkomst overgenomen heeft.   

### Artikel  13  

####Verandering van crediteur

(1).  De crediteur kan het totaal bedrag van zijn vordering, waarvan hij betaling naar het buitenland kan verlangen, overdragen aan een andere buitenlander, mits de overdracht 

(a) geschiedt aan een persoon, gevestigd in hetzelfde valutagebied,  

(b) geen verandering van de voorwaarden, die voor de vordering gelden, ten gevolge heeft,  

(c) niet direct of indirect tot afwikkeling van de schulden leidt.   De bevoegde Duitse instanties zullen hun goedkeuring aan de overdracht hechten, wanneer aan de voorwaarden, genoemd in (*a*) tot en met (*c*) is voldaan. Zij zullen daarenboven goed gefundeerde verzoeken van een buitenlandse crediteur om goedkeuring van de overdracht van een gedeelte van zijn vordering in welwillende overweging nemen. Bij de verkrijging van de vordering krijgt de nieuwe crediteur dezelfde rechten en verplichtingen als de oorspronkelijke crediteur. Wanneer de nieuwe crediteur van de debiteur regeling van de schuld in Duitse mark verlangt, worden op zijn geblokkeerd tegoed, na afloop van een termijn van drie maanden sedert de verandering van crediteur, de bepalingen toegepast voor „oorspronkelijke geblokkeerde tegoeden”.   
(2).  Voor de overdracht van vorderingen, ten aanzien waarvan de crediteur slechts betaling in D. mark kan verlangen, zijn de bepalingen van toepassing betreffende het gebruik en de overdracht van dergelijke vorderingen, die op dat ogenblik van kracht zijn in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek en in Berlijn (West) (zie art. 19.).   

### Artikel  14  

####Toetreding van de crediteur en van de debiteur tot de schuldenregeling; deviezenbepalingen; verplichtingen van debiteuren

(1).  Crediteuren en debiteuren, die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit voorstel voor een regeling een vordering en een schuld wensen te regelen, moeten daarover schriftelijke verklaringen uitwisselen. De verklaring van toetreding door de crediteur kan ook worden afgegeven door een in het land van de crediteur voor dat doel in het leven geroepen instelling.   
(2).  De geldende Duitse en buitenlandse deviezenbepalingen zijn van toepassing op de verhouding tussen crediteur en debiteur, waarbij rekening dient te worden gehouden met de speciale faciliteiten en toezeggingen, die in dit voorstel voor een regeling zijn neergelegd.   
(3).  Wanneer de debiteur weigert een verklaring af te geven, terwijl de crediteur verklaart zich gebonden te achten door zijn eigen verklaring van toetreding tegenover de debiteur, zullen de Duitse deviezenautoriteiten op zijn verzoek aan de crediteur, binnen de grenzen van zijn verklaring van toetreding, alle noodzakelijke deviezenvergunningen verlenen. Deze deviezenvergunningen moeten het de crediteur mogelijk maken zijn debiteur in rechte aan te spreken en zijn vordering te innen, in de omvang en op de wijze, als in het voorstel voor een regeling is bepaald ten aanzien van zulke vorderingen. Voor zover de crediteur na executie niet voldaan is, kan hij zijn verklaring van toetreding tegenover de debiteur herroepen. De verlening van de deviezenvergunning houdt geen beslissing in ten aanzien van het bestaan en het bedrag der vordering.   
(4).  Wanneer de crediteur betaling in D. mark verlangt, moet hij schriftelijk tegenover de debiteur verklaren, dat hij de betaling als voldoening van zijn vordering aanneemt.   
(5).  Wanneer de crediteur betaling naar het buitenland kan verlangen en verlangt, moet de debiteur alle maatregelen nemen, die volgens de geldende Duitse deviezenbepalingen noodzakelijk zijn, om de betaalmiddelen in buitenlandse valuta te verkrijgen.   

### Artikel  15  

####Regeling van geschillen

Voor zover in dit voorstel voor een regeling niet uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, worden geschillen tussen crediteuren en debiteuren over het bestaan en het bedrag van de vorderingen beslist door het gerecht, of door het tussen partijen overeengekomen scheidsgerecht, dat volgens de rechtsverhouding tussen partijen competent is.  

### Artikel  16  

####Gemengde Commissie

Een Gemengde Commissie, die zal bestaan uit een gelijk aantal vertegenwoordigers van de crediteurlanden enerzijds en van de Duitse Bondsregering anderzijds, alsmede uit een voorzitter, zal worden gevormd ten einde over meningsverschillen betreffende de uitlegging van de regeling te beslissen. Aanbevolen wordt, de Commissie bevoegd te doen zijn in kwesties van fundamentele betekenis voor de uitlegging van deze regeling, welke haar door de regeringen worden voorgelegd, te beslissen. Wanneer een regering van mening is, dat een kwestie, die voor het scheidsgerecht (artikel 17) aanhangig is, van fundamentele betekenis is, wordt aanbevolen, dat die regering zal kunnen verlangen, dat het scheidsgerecht de kwestie naar de Gemengde Commissie verwijst. Het scheidsgerecht moet hetzelfde recht hebben.  

### Artikel  17  

####Scheidsgerecht

Het in artikel 11 bedoelde scheidsgerecht bestaat uit een door de crediteur en een door de debiteur benoemde scheidsrechter. De twee scheidsrechters kiezen een voorzitter. Indien zij het over de persoon niet eens kunnen worden, verzoeken zij de Voorzitter van de Internationale Kamer van Koophandel hem te benoemen. De scheidsrechters moeten in hun eigen land de bevoegdheid hebben om het ambt van rechter te bekleden; voor de voorzitter is dit niet noodzakelijk. Het scheidsgerecht regelt zelf de procedure. Het zal ook beslissen, welke partij de kosten moet dragen. De Duitse delegatie zal de Bondsregering adviseren er zorg voor te dragen, dat in gevallen, waarin de partijen niet in staat zijn een voorschot voor kosten te geven, of de vastgestelde te betalen, de voldoening van die kosten op een andere gepaste wijze wordt geregeld. Het scheidsgerecht kan op verzoek van beide partijen ook beslissen in andere geschillen tussen crediteuren en debiteuren. Nadere bepalingen met betrekking tot het in dit artikel bedoelde scheidsgerecht zullen worden vastgesteld bij de intergouvernementele onderhandelingen over de uitvoering van de aanbevelingen van de schuldenconferentie.  

### Artikel  18  

####Betaling in Duitse mark

Onder betaling in D. mark in de zin van deze regeling wordt verstaan de betaling in Duitse valuta op een rekening, die de buitenlandse crediteur op zijn naam heeft staan of voor zich laat openen bij een financiële instelling in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of in Berlijn (West). De rekening is onderworpen aan de geldende Duitse deviezenbepalingen. Het verlenen van speciale vergunningen voor andere wijzen van betaling wordt hiermede niet uitgesloten.  

### Artikel  19  

####Gebruik van geblokkeerde Duitse mark-tegoeden

(1).  Aan de buitenlandse crediteur van een „oorspronkelijk tegoed” in Duitse valuta is het toegestaan dit te gebruiken binnen het raam van de bestaande bepalingen, die op het tijdstip van de inwerkingtreding van deze regeling in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en in Berlijn (West) van kracht zijn; bovendien heeft hij het recht een dergelijk tegoed over te dragen aan een andere persoon buiten Duitsland.   
(2).  De buitenlandse crediteur van een „verkregen tegoed” (erworbenes Guthaben) in Duitse valuta zal ook in de toekomst zijn tegoed aan een andere persoon buiten Duitsland mogen overdragen. De buitenlandse crediteur van zulk een tegoed zal ook in de toekomst zijn tegoed in hoofdzaak mogen gebruiken voor investeringen op lange termijn in Duitsland.   
(3).  De bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten zullen die regelingen treffen, die noodzakelijk zijn om beschikkingen over het tegoed in Duitse valuta in strijd met de wet te voorkomen en om andere misbruiken, die nadelig zijn voor de Duitse volkshuishouding of voor de gezamenlijke crediteuren, uit te sluiten. Een bepaald gebruik, dat op het tijdstip van inwerkingtreding van deze regeling toegestaan is op grond van een algemene vergunning, kan, ter verzekering van de controle, afhankelijk worden gesteld van een speciale vergunning, zonder dat hierdoor de algemene mogelijkheden van gebruik worden beperkt.   
(4).  De bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten zullen er naar streven faciliteiten te verlenen voor het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden, voor zover de deviezenpositie zulks toelaat. Hun doel zal zijn de procedure voor het afgeven van vergunningen zoveel mogelijk te vereenvoudigen.   
(5).  Voor het bespreken van algemene kwesties, die met het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden samenhangen, zal de Bondsregering een commissie van advies vormen, die zal bestaan uit een gelijk aantal vertegenwoordigers van de voornaamste crediteurlanden enerzijds en van de Bondsregering anderzijds.   

### Artikel  20  

####Invloed van de regeling op vorderingen

Voor zover niet anders is bepaald, zal deze regeling als zodanig de vorderingen, waarop zij betrekking heeft, niet wijzigen.  

### Artikel  21  

####Valuta-optie-clausules zonder goud-clausule

De beslissing omtrent de valuta, waarin vorderingen met een valuta-optie-clausule (zonder goud-clausule) moeten worden betaald, blijft voorbehouden aan intergouvernementele overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  22  

####Concessies ten gunste van de debiteur

De crediteuren zijn van mening, dat de voordelen uit de concessies, die zij in het kader van deze regeling doen, de debiteuren ten goede moeten komen.  

### Artikel  23  

####Echte conversies

(1).  Een wijziging in de voorwaarden van een schuldverhouding wordt als een echte conversie beschouwd, indien zij heeft plaats gevonden voor 9 Juni 1933 of indien zij op of na 9 Juni 1933 heeft plaats gevonden als gevolg van vrije onderhandelingen dan wel wegens insolventie of dreigende insolventie van de debiteur.   
(2).  Aangenomen wordt, dat er geen sprake is van echte conversie op grond van vrije onderhandelingen, wanneer de crediteur op het tijdstip van de conversie door de Duitse Treuhänder voor vijandelijk vermogen of door een dergelijke door een Duitse instantie zonder zijn toestemming benoemde persoon, vertegenwoordigd was.   
(3).  Bij vorderingen uit obligaties is er ook dan geen echte conversie, indien zij zich uitsluitend beperkt heeft tot het aannemen door de crediteur van een door de debiteur gedaan eenzijdig aanbod.   
(4).  De debiteur moet bewijzen, dat het een echte conversie betreft.   
(5).  Bij kerkelijke leningen wordt elke conversie als een echte conversie beschouwd.   

### Artikel  24  

####Valuta, waarin betaald moet worden

Bepalingen over de valuta, waarin geldvorderingen moeten worden betaald, blijven aan intergouvernementele overeenkomsten voorbehouden.  

### Artikel  25  

####Wetten voor de certificatie van Duitse effecten

Deze regeling vindt geen toepassing op obligaties en coupons, die op grond van de Duitse wet op de certificatie van effecten van 19 Augustus 1949 (Wirtschaftsgesetzbl. S. 295) en de wet op de certificatie van Duitse „Auslandsbonds” van Augustus 1952 moeten worden gecertificeerd, zolang deze obligaties en coupons niet zijn gecertificeerd volgens de bepalingen van deze wetten en eventuele overeenkomsten, gesloten met het land van emissie met betrekking tot deze wetten.  

### Hoofdstuk  C  

####Regeling van oude handelsvorderingen (artikel 1)

### Artikel  26  

####Vorderingen uit hoofde van de levering van goederen (artikel 1 (1))

(1).  De crediteur heeft het recht van de debiteur betaling naar het buitenland te verlangen, en wel: 

(a) van één derde van het verschuldigde bedrag vanaf het begin van het jaar 1953;  

(b) van de resterende twee derden van het verschuldigde bedrag, in tien gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen, vanaf 1 Januari 1954.     
(2).  De crediteur kan tot 31 December 1953 verlangen, dat de debiteur, in plaats van de onder lid (1) (*b*) bedoelde betaling naar het buitenland, binnen drie maanden na zijn desbetreffend verzoek het restant van zijn vordering (twee derden van het oorspronkelijk verschuldigde bedrag) in D. mark betaalt. Aan crediteuren en debiteuren wordt overgelaten in onderling overleg deze termijn met nog eens drie maanden te verlengen, indien bijzondere omstandigheden daartoe aanleiding geven.   
(3).  Na 31 December 1953 kan de crediteur betaling van het restant van zijn vordering in D. mark alleen met goedvinden van de debiteur verlangen.   

### Artikel  27  

####Vorderingen uit hoofde van vooruitbetalingen voor levering van goederen en diensten (artikel 1 (2))

(1).  Crediteuren en debiteuren dienen, voor zover noodzakelijk met goedkeuring van de bevoegde instanties, overeenstemming te bereiken over een regeling, die voor hun geval passend is.   
(2).  Wanneer het niet mogelijk is, tot overeenstemming te komen, heeft de crediteur het recht van de debiteur betaling van het verschuldigde bedrag naar het buitenland te verlangen in tien gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen, te beginnen met 1 October 1953.   
(3).  De crediteur kan tot 31 December 1953 verlangen, dat de debiteur, in plaats van de onder lid (2) bedoelde betaling naar het buitenland, binnen drie maanden na zijn desbetreffend verzoek, het gehele bedrag zijner vordering in D. mark betaalt. Aan crediteuren en debiteuren wordt het overgelaten in bijzondere omstandigheden, in onderling overleg deze termijn met nog eens drie maanden te verlengen.   
(4).  Na 31 December 1953 kan de crediteur betaling van de vordering in D. mark alleen met goedkeuring van de debiteur verlangen.   

### Artikel  28  

####Lonen, salarissen, pensioenen, die berusten op een arbeidsovereenkomst; commissies (artikel 1 (7))

(1).  De crediteur kan van de debiteur betaling van het verschuldigde bedrag naar het buitenland verlangen in vijf gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen, te beginnen met 1 Januari 1953. Bij deze regeling kunnen, op verzoek van de rechthebbende, of van een particuliere organisatie van een overheidsinstelling, waaraan de rechthebbende op de vereiste wijze volmacht heeft gegeven om voor hem te handelen, gericht tot de bevoegde Duitse instanties, ook die bedragen betrokken worden, waarvan bewezen kan worden, dat zij tijdelijk door de rechthebbende of zijn werkgever te zijnen gunste op een rekening bij een financiële instelling, gevestigd in het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek of in Berlijn (West), waren gestort. Aan de bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten blijft het recht voorbehouden de mogelijkheid van een vluggere betaling naar het buitenland in gevallen van hardheid in welwillende overweging te nemen.   
(2).  De crediteur kan te allen tijde verlangen, dat de debiteur het resterende bedrag, hetwelk nog niet naar het buitenland is overgemaakt, binnen drie maanden na zijn desbetreffend verzoek, in D. mark betaalt.   

### Artikel  29  

####Verplichtingen uit sociale verzekering (artikel 1 (8))

Deze zijn reeds het voorwerp van bilaterale onderhandelingen en verdragen, of kunnen het in de toekomst worden. Aanbevolen wordt, de achterstallige betalingen in deze verdragen op te nemen.  

### Artikel  30  

####Vorderingen uit het particuliere verzekeringsverkeer (artikel 1 (9))

(1).  Vorderingen en schulden van beide partijen uit alle soorten verzekerings- en herverzekeringsovereenkomsten of -verdragen, of verband houdend met zulke overeenkomsten of verdragen, kunnen het voorwerp van bilaterale onderhandelingen vormen. Zulke vorderingen en schulden kunnen slechts geldend gemaakt worden overeenkomstig de desbetreffende bilaterale overeenkomsten.   
(2).  Indien zulke bilaterale overeenkomsten voor de directe verzekering niet bestaan of niet zijn afgesloten voor 31 Maart 1953, worden aanspraken van buitenlandse verzekeringnemers of verzekeringsmaatschappijen in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en in Berlijn (West) volgens de volgende bepalingen geregeld: 

(a) vorderingen uit overeenkomsten van levensverzekering, volgens de voorschriften van de artikelen 33 en 34;  

(b) vorderingen uit overeenkomsten van schade-, ongevallen- en aansprakelijkheidsverzekeringen: 

(aa) indien de verzekeringsovereenkomst is afgesloten voor verzekering van vermogenswaarden, die in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of in Berlijn (West) gelegen zijn, vindt betaling in D. mark plaats volgens de in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en Berlijn (West) geldende deviezenbepalingen;  

(bb) vorderingen uit andere overeenkomsten van schade-, ongevallen- en aansprakelijkheidsverzekeringen, worden volgens de voorschriften van artikel 31 geregeld;    

(c) vorderingen uit alle soorten verzekeringsovereenkomsten voor betaling van pensioenen, volgens de bepalingen van artikel 28.   Bijzonderheden van de bepalingen in lid (2) zullen nog in de overeenkomst worden geregeld.   

### Artikel  31  

####Andere oude handelsvorderingen (artikel 1 (3), (4), (5) en (6))

(1).  De crediteur kan van de debiteur betaling van het verschuldigde bedrag naar het buitenland verlangen in tien gelijke jaarlijkse betalingen, te beginnen met 1 Juli 1953.   
(2).  De crediteur kan tot 31 December 1953 verlangen, dat de debiteur in plaats van de onder lid (1) bedoelde betaling naar het buitenland, binnen drie maanden na zijn desbetreffend verzoek, het verschuldigde bedrag in D. mark betaalt. Aan crediteuren en debiteuren wordt het overgelaten in bijzondere omstandigheden, in onderling overleg, deze termijn met nog eens drie maanden te verlengen.   
(3).  Na 31 December 1953 kan de crediteur betaling van de vordering in D. mark alleen met goedkeuring van de debiteur verlangen.   
(4).  In bijzondere gevallen kunnen crediteur en debiteur, onder voorbehoud van goedkeuring door de bevoegde instanties, een afwijkende regeling treffen.   

### Artikel  32  

####Gemeenschappelijke bepalingen voor oude handelsvorderingen (artikel 1(1) tot en met (9))

(1).   *Achterstallige renten*  Indien over een vordering rente verschuldigd is, zal het bedrag van de tot 31 December 1952 achterstallige rente, zonder bijberekening van samengestelde interest, op de volgende basis worden vastgesteld: 

(a) bedroeg de jaarlijkse rente tot nu toe 4 % of minder, dan blijft deze rente gehandhaafd;  

(b) bedroeg de jaarlijkse rente tot nu toe meer dan 4 %, dan wordt deze tot twee derden doch tot niet minder dan 4 % per jaar gereduceerd. Het gereduceerde bedrag aan achterstallige rente wordt aan de hoofdsom toegevoegd.     
(2).   *Toekomstige renten*  Voor het tijdvak van 1 Januari 1953 tot 31 December 1957 zal geen rente verschuldigd zijn. Indien over de vordering gedurende de periode voor 1 Januari 1953 rente verschuldigd was, zal het op 1 Januari 1958 of later nog niet geamortiseerde bedrag der vordering rente dragen vanaf deze datum. Het rentepercentage zal 75 % bedragen van de verschuldigde rente. Het nieuwe rentepercentage zal echter minstens 4 %, en hoogstens 6 % per jaar bedragen. Wanneer tot nu toe een rente van 4 % per jaar of minder verschuldigd was, blijft deze onveranderd. De rente zal aan het eind van elk jaar, tezamen met het amortisatiebedrag, naar het buitenland worden betaald.   
(3).   *Speciale geblokkeerde rekening (Sonderdepot)*  

(a) Voor zover vorderingen behoren tot de categorieën, bedoeld in artikel 1(1) tot en met (7), kan de crediteur, indien hij bewijzen kan dat zijn vordering gevaar loopt, in plaats van betaling volgens de artikelen 26, 27, 28 of 31, van de debiteur betaling verlangen op een speciale geblokkeerde D. mark-rekening op zijn naam bij een instelling, die moet worden aangewezen door de bevoegde Duitse instanties. Indien de debiteur, in verband met een dergelijk verzoek, een beroep doet op de hardheidsclausule (zie artikel 11), zal hij eerst gehouden zijn aan het verzoek van de crediteur tot storting te voldoen, wanneer het beroep van de debiteur op de hardheidsclausule definitief is afgewezen.  

(b) De debiteur kan het bedrag van een schuld, die tot de hierboven sub (*a*) bedoelde categorieën behoort, ten gunste van de crediteur op zulk een rekening storten, wanneer kan worden bewezen dat 

(aa) de debiteur erfgenaam of executeur-testamentair van de oorspronkelijke debiteur is en de nalatenschap zal worden verdeeld;  

(bb) de debiteur een maatschappij is, en deze in liquidatie is getreden;  

(cc) de curator van de debiteur, of de persoon, die voor hem een accoord aanbiedt, overgaat tot het doen van uitkeringen.    

(c) De betaling op een geblokkeerde rekening, overeenkomstig de bovenbedoelde voorschriften, bevrijdt de debiteur van zijn schuld. De crediteur wordt in dit geval, wat betreft de betaling naar het buitenland, op dezelfde wijze behandeld, alsof het op meerbedoelde rekening betaalde bedrag (met inbegrip van rente, indien de instelling, waar het bedrag is gedeponeerd, rente vergoedt) nog in handen van de debiteur was.  

(d) De crediteur heeft te allen tijde het recht te verlangen, dat een op een dergelijke rekening gestort bedrag naar zijn rekening in D. mark (zie artikel 18) wordt overgebracht.     
(4).   *Vorderingen tot een gering bedrag*  De bevoegde Duitse instanties zullen ten aanzien van vorderingen tot geringe bedragen verzoeken van beide partijen om goedkeuring voor een vluggere betaling naar het buitenland in welwillende overweging nemen.   
(5).   *Betalingen voor goederen en diensten, ten aanzien waarvan de crediteur bewijst, dat de storting op zijn rekening zonder zijn goedkeuring heeft plaats gevonden*  Een crediteur, die bewijst, dat een storting op zijn bank- of postgirorekening voor levering van goederen of diensten (artikel 1) zonder zijn toestemming heeft plaats gevonden, zal door het feit van de storting op zulk een rekening het recht op behandeling van de storting volgens Hoofdstuk C niet verliezen.   

### Hoofdstuk  D  

####Regeling van vorderingen uit het particuliere kapitaalverkeer (artikel 2)

### Artikel  33  

Vorderingen uit het kapitaalverkeer in D. mark, met inbegrip van die vorderingen, die in goudmark of in Rijksmark met goud-clausule luiden en die niet een specifiek buitenlands karakter hebben (zie artikel 6), kunnen ook verder worden betaald volgens de overeengekomen rente- en amortisatie-voorwaarden, in overeenstemming met de op het tijdstip der betaling in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en in Berlijn (West) geldende deviezenbepalingen. Volgens de op het ogenblik geldende bepalingen kan betaling alleen in D. mark geschieden.  

### Artikel  34  

Vorderingen uit het kapitaalverkeer, die in niet-Duitse valuta luiden, met inbegrip van die vorderingen, die in goudmark of Rijksmark met goud-clausule luiden doch een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen, (zie artikel 6), zullen als volgt worden geregeld: 

(1) Voor zover de debiteur betalingen heeft gedaan aan de Konversionskasse für deutsche Auslandsschulden, worden de bedragen, welke onbetaald zijn gebleven van hoofdsom en rente, vastgesteld volgens de bepalingen van artikel 9.  

(2) Indien rente verschuldigd is, zal het bedrag van de tot 31 December 1952 achterstallige rente, zonder bijberekening van samengestelde interest, op de volgende basis worden vastgesteld: 

(a) bedroeg de jaarlijkse rente tot nu toe 4 % of minder, dan blijft deze rente gehandhaafd;  

(b) bedroeg de jaarlijkse rente tot nu toe meer dan 4 %, dan wordt deze tot twee derden doch tot niet minder dan 4 % per jaar gereduceerd.    

(3) Het volgens de leden (1) en (2) vastgestelde bedrag aan achterstallige rente wordt toegevoegd aan de nog onbetaalde vordering. De aldus ontstane nieuwe hoofdsom zal vanaf 1 Januari 1953 een rente dragen, die 75 % zal bedragen van de bij de inwerkingtreding van deze regeling geldende rentevoet. De nieuwe rente zal echter 

(a) bij in obligaties belichaamde vorderingen minstens 4 % per jaar en hoogstens 5¼ % per jaar,  

(b) bij andere vorderingen minstens 4 % per jaar en hoogstens 6 % per jaar   bedragen. Was tot nu toe een rente van 4 % of minder verschuldigd, dan blijft deze rente gehandhaafd. De rente zal minstens halfjaarlijks naar het buitenland worden betaald.  

(4) Bij vorderingen, die het voorwerp zijn geweest van een echte conversie, vormt de rente, die bij de echte conversie overeengekomen is, de basis voor de berekening van eventuele reducties overeenkomstig de leden (2) en (3). Reducties op de rentevoet, die voor een bepaald tijdvak gelden, worden slechts in aanmerking genomen voor het tijdvak, waarvoor zij zijn vastgesteld.  

(5) Bij vorderingen, die het voorwerp zijn geweest van een onechte conversie, vormt de rente, die zonder deze conversie zou hebben gegolden, de basis voor de berekening van eventuele reducties overeenkomstig de leden (2) en (3).  

(6) De nieuwe hoofdsom zal vanaf 1 Januari 1958 als volgt door betaling naar het buitenland worden geamortiseerd: 

(a) in de eerste vijf jaar (1 Januari 1958 tot 31 December 1962) met 3 % per jaar;  

(b) in de volgende vijf jaar (1 Januari 1963 tot 31 December 1967) met 8 % per jaar;  

(c) in de daaropvolgende drie jaar (1 Januari 1968 tot 31 December 1970) met 15 % per jaar.   De rente zal telkens over de nog uitstaande hoofdsom worden berekend.  

(7) De crediteur kan tot 30 Juni 1953 verlangen, dat de achterstallige rente, berekend overeenkomstig de leden (2) en (4), niet overeenkomstig lid (3) bij de hoofdsom wordt gevoegd, doch wordt vereffend door betaling in D. mark. De debiteur zal deze betaling binnen zes maanden na het desbetreffend verzoek doen geschieden.  

(8) Indien het om kleine bedragen gaat, kunnen partijen in bijzondere gevallen, met toestemming van de bevoegde Duitse instanties, in onderling overleg afwijkende bepalingen vaststellen, voor de terugbetaling.  

(9) Crediteuren en debiteuren kunnen, met inachtneming van de in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland of in Berlijn (West) geldende deviezenbepalingen, overeenkomen, dat de vordering geheel of gedeeltelijk in D. mark zal worden betaald.  

(10) De bevoegde Duitse instanties behouden zich het recht voor, in gevallen van hardheid, verzoeken van de partijen om goedkeuring van afwijkende bepalingen voor de terugbetaling in welwillende overweging te nemen.  

(11) Buitenlandse crediteuren van vorderingen als bedoeld in artikel 2, lid (2) (*b*) kunnen betaling in D. mark verlangen van de tot 31 December 1952 vervallen rente, zonder de korting bedoeld in lid (2) van dit artikel, indien zij deze betaling aannemen als voldoening van hun vordering.  

(12) Indien noodzakelijk, kunnen voor de regeling van vorderingen uit obligaties en coupons, die onder dit voorstel voor een regeling vallen, de in Bijlage II van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden neergelegde principes worden aangewend ter aanvulling van dit voorstel voor een regeling.    

### Hoofdstuk  E  

####Achterstallige inkomsten uit investeringen (artikel 3)

### Artikel  35  

De betaling geschiedt in D. mark, overeenkomstig de in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en in Berlijn (West) geldende deviezenbepalingen.  

### Hoofdstuk  F  

####Andere geldvorderingen (artikel 4)

### Artikel  36  

Deze vorderingen zullen worden geregeld overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de categorie van vorderingen, waartoe zij behoren, of waarmede zij naar hun aard het meest overeenkomen. In twijfelgevallen zal rekening worden gehouden met de bepalingen, die in het algemeen in de betalingsovereenkomsten worden opgenomen.

####Gemeenschappelijke verklaring van de Duitse en de Zwitserse delegaties bij de onderhandelingen over de regeling van Zwitserse „Frankengrundschulden”

In Freiburg i. B. hebben op 10 en 11 Juni 1952 onderhandelingen plaats gevonden ter uitvoering van de verklaring van 20 Maart 1952 door de vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren en debiteuren, opgesteld voor de Londense Schuldenconferentie. Deze onderhandelingen hebben echter niet tot een conclusie kunnen leiden. Hiervan is aan de Londense Schuldenconferentie mededeling gedaan bij een verklaring van 11 Juni 1952. Voortzetting van de onderhandelingen bleek echter door verschillende omstandigheden tot dusverre niet mogelijk. Zo spoedig mogelijk zullen partijen deze onderhandelingen echter weer opnemen, met medewerking van de „Vertrauensstelle”. De Duitse delegatie zal de Londense Conferentie tijdig voor de ondertekening van de Intergouvernementele Overeenkomst inzake de Duitse buitenlandse schulden van het resultaat van meerbedoelde onderhandelingen in kennis stellen. Van Zwitserse zijde wordt opnieuw verwezen naar het exposé over de Zwitserse „Frankengrundschulden”, hetwelk aan de Conferentie werd voorgelegd in aansluiting aan de verklaringen van de Zwitserse delegatie in de tweede plenaire zitting van 29 Februari 1952, en dat onder Ref. Nr. GD/V/Onderh. Comm. D/Dok. 3 dd. 13 Maart 1952 is gedistribueerd. Van Zwitserse zijde wordt derhalve het recht voorbehouden nader een standpunt te bepalen, afhankelijk van het resultaat van de bilaterale onderhandelingen. Van Duitse zijde is men daarentegen van mening, dat de Zwitserse „Frankengrundschulden” vallen binnen het kader van de Londense Conferentie inzake de Duitse buitenlandse schulden, en dat zij geregeld behoren te worden volgens de beginselen, die uitgewerkt zijn in de Onderhandelingscommissie D. Beide partijen zijn het er over eens, dat een scheidsgerecht, zoals zal worden ingesteld binnen het kader van de regeling voor de schulden, behandeld in de Onderhandelingscommissie D, niet bevoegd zal zijn ten aanzien van de Zwitserse „Frankengrundschulden”, doch dat de desbetreffende gevallen behoren te worden voorgelegd aan de „Vertrauensstelle”, ingesteld op grond van de Duits-Zwitserse overeenkomsten.

### BIJLAGE  V  

####Overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor de behandeling van betalingen aan de Konversionskasse

I. De Duitse delegatie was van mening, dat de Duitse debiteur tot het totale bedrag van zijn betalingen aan de Konversionskasse definitief van zijn schuld bevrijd was. De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren waren echter van mening, dat als regel zulke betalingen aan de Konversionskasse volgens het in hun land geldende recht niet als bevrijdend voor de Duitse debiteur erkend zouden worden. In het verlangen aan vruchteloze juridische discussies een einde te maken, zijn beide partijen overeengekomen een practische oplossing te zoeken, welke het mogelijk zou maken de aanspraken van de crediteuren zonder onnodige formaliteiten te regelen. De Duitse delegatie en de vertegenwoordigers van buitenlandse crediteuren zijn derhalve, onder handhaving van hun juridische standpunten het volgende overeengekomen: 

(1) De Duitse debiteur verplicht zich de vordering van de crediteur volgens de nieuwe voorwaarden van de regeling te betalen ongeacht de door hem aan de Konversionskasse gedane betalingen, voor zover de crediteur 

(a) van de Konversionskasse het bedrag, overeenkomende met het door de debiteur gestorte, niet werkelijk heeft ontvangen, of  

(b) een betaling of prestatie van de Konversionskasse op grond van een betaling door de debiteur gedaan, heeft geweigerd, omdat de crediteur de betaling of prestatie niet als voldoening van de schuld wilde erkennen.   Bij effecten, waarop het „Bereinigungsgesetz für deutsche Auslandsbonds” van toepassing is, zal deze regeling slechts betrekking hebben op die obligaties en coupons, welke erkend zijn op grond van die wet en eventuele over de toepassing van die wet gesloten overeenkomsten met het land van emissie, of waarvoor de crediteur volgens die wet een declaratoire beslissing (Feststellungsbescheid) heeft gekregen.  

(2) De bedragen zullen uit de Duitse openbare kas aan de debiteuren worden vergoed.  

(3) Voor de betalingen aan de Konversionskasse gedaan, welke niet vallen onder (1), is de debiteur van zijn schuld bevrijd.    

II. Onder voorbehoud van de algemene bepalingen hierboven onder I bedoeld, wordt het volgende bepaald: 

(a) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland verbindt zich de aansprakelijkheid voor de volledige betaling in de verschuldigde valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren over te nemen voor die bedragen, die door debiteuren in het Saargebied in de Konversionskasse zijn gestort, en met betrekking tot welke de buitenlandse crediteuren noch betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen, noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(b) De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland verbindt zich de aansprakelijkheid voor de betaling in de verschuldigde valuta's aan de buitenlandse crediteuren over te nemen voor 60 % van die bedragen, die door debiteuren in Oostenrijk, Frankrijk, België en Luxemburg in de Konversionskasse zijn gestort en met betrekking tot welke de buitenlandse crediteuren noch betaling in buitenlandse valuta hebben ontvangen, noch op andere wijze zijn voldaan.  

(c) De Bondsregering zal voor eind December 1952 met de vertegenwoordigers van buitenlandse crediteuren onderhandelingen beginnen met betrekking tot de uitvoering van deze verplichtingen.       

### BIJLAGE  VI  

####Overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden

Voor het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden zijn de volgende regelingen getroffen: 

(1) Aan de buitenlandse crediteur van een „oorspronkelijk tegoed” in Duitse valuta is het toegestaan dit te gebruiken binnen het raam van de bepalingen, die op het tijdstip van de inwerkingtreding van deze regeling in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en in Berlijn (West) van kracht zijn; bovendien heeft hij het recht een dergelijk tegoed over te dragen aan een andere persoon buiten Duitsland.  

(2) De buitenlandse crediteur van een „verkregen tegoed” (erworbenes Guthaben) in Duitse valuta zal ook in de toekomst zijn tegoed aan een andere persoon buiten Duitsland mogen overdragen. De buitenlandse crediteur van zulk een tegoed zal ook in de toekomst zijn tegoed in hoofdzaak mogen gebruiken voor investeringen op lange termijn in Duitsland.  

(3) De bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten zullen die regelingen treffen, welke noodzakelijk zijn om beschikkingen over het tegoed in Duitse valuta in strijd met de wet te voorkomen en om andere misbruiken, die nadelig zijn voor de Duitse volkshuishouding of de gezamenlijke crediteuren, uit te sluiten. Een bepaald gebruik, dat op het tijdstip van de inwerkingtreding van deze regeling op grond van een algemene vergunning is toegestaan, kan, teneinde de controle te verzekeren, afhankelijk worden gesteld van een speciale vergunning, zonder dat hierdoor de algemene mogelijkheden van gebruik worden beperkt.  

(4) De bevoegde Duitse autoriteiten zullen er naar streven faciliteiten te verlenen voor het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden, voor zover de deviezenpositie zulks toelaat. Hun doel zal zijn de procedure voor het afgeven van vergunningen zoveel mogelijk te vereenvoudigen.  

(5) Voor het bespreken van algemene kwesties, die met het gebruik van geblokkeerde D. mark-tegoeden samenhangen, zal de Bondsregering een commissie van advies vormen, die zal bestaan uit een gelijk aantal vertegenwoordigers van de voornaamste crediteurlanden enerzijds en van de Bondsregering anderzijds.

####Overeenkomst over verplichtingen in goudmark en Rijksmark met goud-clausule, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen

De Duitse delegatie voor buitenlandse schulden. 243-18 Del 39-2177/52 Aan de Voorzitter van de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden, 29, Chesham Place, Londen, S.W. 1.  *Londen, 21 November 1952.*  Mijnheer de Voorzitter, De onderhandelingen bedoeld in artikel V lid 3 van bijlage 4 en in artikel 6 van bijlage 6 bij het rapport van de Londense Schulden-conferentie en genoemd in de gemeenschappelijke brief van de heer Otto Niemeyer en de heer Hermann J. Abs aan de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden, waarbij de criteria voor het specifiek buitenlands karakter van verplichtingen in goudmark en Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie vastgelegd zouden worden, hebben plaatsgevonden in Londen van 21 October tot 21 November tussen de Duitse delegatie voor de buitenlandse schulden en een delegatie van vertegenwoordigers van Britse, Amerikaanse, Zwitserse en Nederlandse crediteuren. Het doet ons genoegen U te kunnen mededelen, dat deze onderhandelingen op 21 November 1952 tot een schikking hebben geleid, welke werd vastgelegd in een overeenkomst, die vandaag is getekend. De Voorzitters van de beide delegaties hebben bij de ondertekening van de overeenkomst vier brieven, gedateerd 21 November 1952 uitgewisseld, welke tot doel hebben verschillende vraagpunten in verband met de overeenkomst duidelijk te maken, namelijk: 

1. Briefwisseling betreffende de transfer van bedragen ter voldoening van vorderingen in goudmark met een specifiek buitenlands karakter.  

2. Briefwisseling betreffende de uitlegging van de bepaling over het „Treuhandvertrag”.  

3. Briefwisseling betreffende een kwestie van interpretatie verband houdende met de 40ste Uitvoeringsverordening van de Wet op de munthervorming (Umstellungsgesetz).  

4. Briefwisseling betreffende een voorbehoud door de crediteuren gemaakt met betrekking tot de omzetting van vorderingen op secundaire debiteuren en de mogelijkheid dit voorbehoud in te trekken.   Wij hebben de eer U een copie voor te leggen van de door ons ondertekende tekst van de overeenkomst, in het Duits en Engels, en van de vier briefwisselingen, eveneens in het Duits en Engels, met het verzoek deze zo spoedig mogelijk goed te keuren. Wij zouden U erkentelijk zijn, indien de overeenkomst evenals de vier briefwisselingen als onderbijlagen bij de Bijlagen I, II en IV van de Schuldenovereenkomst gevoegd zouden kunnen worden. Met de meeste hoogachting enz. (w.g.) Hermann J. ABS Hoofd van de Duitse delegatie voor de buitenlandse schulden. (w.g.) N. LEGGETT Voorzitter van de Onderhandelingscommissie B van de Conferentie over de Duitse buitenlandse schulden. Opmerking: 

1.  *De ondertekenaars van de vorenstaande brief zijn overeengekomen, dat deze stukken thans Bijlage VII van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden zullen worden; het in de laatste alinea van de brief uitgesproken verzoek, deze stukken als onderbijlagen te voegen bij de Bijlagen I, II en IV van de Overeenkomst is hiermede vervallen.*   

2.  *De in de slotalinea van de vorenstaande brief bedoelde briefwisseling is thans samengevat en als onderbijlage bij de Bijlage VII gevoegd.*    
###Overeenkomst over verplichtingen in goudmark en Rijksmark met goud-clausule, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen

*Londen, 21 November 1952.*  Op grond van het voorbehoud, gemaakt in artikel V, lid 3, van bijlage 4 en in artikel 6 van bijlage 6 bij het rapport van de Londense schuldenconferentie, alsmede op grond van het gemeenschappelijk schrijven van de leiders van de Duitse delegatie de heer Hermann J. Abs en de heer Otto Niemeyer aan de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor de Duitse schulden van 19 November 1952, betreffende leningen in goudmark van Duitse gemeenten, wordt het volgende overeengekomen: 

I. Van de navolgende vorderingen en rechten wordt erkend, dat zij een specifiek buitenlands karakter in de zin van de vorenbedoelde bepalingen hebben. 

1. Vorderingen uitgedrukt in goudmark of Rijksmark met goudclausule of goudoptie uit hoofde van door binnenlandse debiteuren in het buitenland uitgegeven of geplaatste obligaties, 

(a) wanneer zij een lening vormen, waarvan de voorwaarden uitwijzen, dat zij uitsluitend was bestemd voor plaatsing, verkoop of verhandeling in het buitenland. Wanneer de rente van een obligatie vrijgesteld is van belasting op kapitaalopbrengsten, dan wordt de obligatie beschouwd een gedeelte te vormen van een lening, welke uitsluitend bestemd was voor plaatsing, verkoop of verhandeling in het buitenland; of  

(b) wanneer zij blijkens de tekst van de obligaties uitsluitend in het buitenland betaalbaar zijn.   Als lening in de zin van de letters *(a)* en *(b)* geldt ook een gedeelte van een lening, hetwelk zich door een bijzondere aanduiding of bijzondere behandeling in Duitsland met betrekking tot belasting en notering van het overige deel van de lening onderscheidt, behalve wanneer de tot dit deel van de lening behorende obligaties vóór 1 September 1939 officieel waren genoteerd op een Duitse beurs.  

2. Vorderingen uitgedrukt in goudmark of in Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie uit hoofde van andere door binnenlandse debiteuren in het buitenland opgenomen leningen of credieten in verband met het kapitaalverkeer, met inbegrip van vorderingen van dit soort, die door hypotheek gedekt zijn, wanneer 

(a) in de oorspronkelijke, schriftelijke voorwaarden van de schuld uitdrukkelijk was vastgelegd, dat deze in het buitenland betaalbaar is, een buitenlandse rechterlijke instantie bevoegd is of buitenlands recht van toepassing is, en wanneer  

(b) het equivalent, voor zover de schuld na 31 Juli 1931 werd aangegaan, in buitenlandse valuta, vrije Rijksmark of goud beschikbaar is gesteld of afkomstig is uit een geblokkeerde Rijksmarkrekening, waarop terugbetalingen op een lening in goudmark of vreemde valuta, door het buitenland vóór 31 Juli 1931 verstrekt, waren gecrediteerd, voor zover de buitenlandse crediteur de bedragen, onttrokken aan de geblokkeerde Rijksmark-rekening, met goedkeuring van de bevoegde Duitse deviezeninstanties, opnieuw heeft uitgeleend aan een andere Duitse debiteur, onder voorwaarde van een goud- of goudoptieclausule.   Een lening of crediet wordt ook geacht in het buitenland te zijn opgenomen, wanneer het de debiteur, toen hij de schuld aanging, bekend was, dat de Duitse crediteur op grond van een „Treuhandvertrag” uitsluitend als de trustee van een geldgever in het buitenland optrad. Een lening of een crediet, dat bij de buitenlandse trustee van een Duitse geldgever is opgenomen, wordt geacht niet in het buitenland te zijn opgenomen.    

II. Tot de vorderingen en rechten hierboven onder I bedoeld behoren niet vorderingen van buitenlandse credietinstellingen en verzekeringsmaatschappijen, die volgens Duits recht een conversierekening moesten aanhouden, onder voorbehoud dat de vorderingen op deze rekening als activa opgenomen behoorden te worden.  

III.  <sup> 1)  Deze tekst is op 12 Februari 1953 in onderling overleg tussen partijen aldus vastgesteld.  </sup> Ten aanzien van zekerheden op onroerend goed (Hypotheken, Grundschulden und Rentenschulden), die op 20 Juni 1948 waren gesteld ter verzekering van de in deze overeenkomst bedoelde persoonlijke vorderingen van een buitenlandse crediteur, blijft het, behoudens de volgende bepalingen, bij de oorspronkelijke omzetting, welke op grond van de Wet op de munthervorming (Umstellungsgesetz) met inbegrip van de daarbij behorende 40ste Uitvoeringsverordening heeft plaats gevonden. In die gevallen, waarin zulk een zekerheid op onroerend goed, volgens deze voorschriften, in een andere verhouding als 1 : 1 is omgezet, zal de zakelijke zekerheid van de crediteur in de vorm van zekerheid op onroerend goed tot hetzelfde nominale bedrag als de zekerheid op onroerend goed te zijnen gunste op 20 Juni 1948, onder aftrek van eventuele verminderingen sindsdien, hersteld worden in dezelfde rang, voor zover dit mogelijk is zonder aantasting van door derden in het tijdvak van 21 Juni 1948 tot 15 Juli 1952 verworven zakelijke rechten. Voor zover in het genoemde tijdvak derden zakelijke rechten hebben verworven, gelden de volgende beginselen, ten aanzien waarvan is overeengekomen, dat zij in details in de Duitse wetgeving zullen worden uitgewerkt: 

(a) Als het onroerend goed van eigenaar is veranderd, wordt de aldus verdwenen zekerheid van de crediteur slechts in zoverre door een hypotheek hersteld, als de heffing wegens winst op hypotheken (Hypothekengewinnabgabe) wordt verminderd.  

(b) Wanneer een derde een ander zakelijk recht op het onroerend goed heeft verkregen, wordt de aldus verdwenen zekerheid van de crediteur slechts door een in rang op het eerstbedoelde zakelijk recht volgende hypotheek vervangen. Wordt echter de heffing wegens winst op hypotheken (Hypothekengewinnabgabe) verminderd, dan treedt de crediteur, voor zover deze vermindering de derde ten goede komt, in diens rang.  

(c) De crediteur, die een vordering met een specifiek buitenlands karakter heeft, zal recht van verhaal krijgen op een vordering tot schadevergoeding, die aan de debiteur mocht worden toegekend, voor zover de zakelijke zekerheid van de crediteur niet in de oorspronkelijke rang of tot het volle bedrag van de door zekerheid gedekte vordering kan worden hersteld.  

(d) In gevallen, waarin de crediteur geen zekerheid kan worden gegeven welke, wat het bedrag betreft, overeenkomt met de vroegere zekerheid, zal de debiteur in staat worden gesteld de vordering ten laste van de openbare kas te voldoen, voor zover deze vordering, als gevolg van de onmogelijkheid de vroegere zekerheid te herstellen, niet uit de gestelde zekerheden kan worden voldaan.   Overeengekomen is, dat voor Berlijn (West) een overeenkomstige regeling, aangepast aan de bijzondere kenmerken van het daar geldende recht, zal worden getroffen, zonder dat daardoor de bestaande rechten van de crediteuren of hun hierboven vastgestelde rechten worden verminderd.  

IV. In elk geval zal voor het specifiek buitenlands karakter een vereiste zijn, dat de vorderingen op 1 Januari 1945 toekwamen aan een persoon, die op dat tijdstip de nationaliteit van een crediteurland bezat of op dat tijdstip, zonder de Duitse nationaliteit te bezitten, in een crediteurland woonachtig was. Voor zover een vordering of een zekerheid voor een vordering op dat tijdstip aan een trustee toekwam, is de maatstaf niet de persoon van de trustee, doch de persoon van de opdrachtgever. Een rechtspersoon wordt geacht in de zin van de vorenbedoelde bepalingen de nationaliteit te bezitten van het land, volgens welks wetten zij is opgericht.  

V. De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren hebben verzocht de vorderingen, met inbegrip van hypotheken, van buitenlandse crediteuren tegen secundaire debiteuren [in de zin van Artikel 15 lid (8) van de Wet op de munthervorming (Umstellungsgesetz) zoals dit luidt in de nieuwe bewoordingen volgens de AHK-wet Nr. 46 (Amtsblatt 1951 Nr. 46 S. 756) — zonder beperking echter tot onderdanen van de Verenigde Naties], voor zover deze vorderingen of zekerheden in goudmark of in Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie luidden, te beschouwen als hebbende een specifiek buitenlands karakter en om te zetten in de verhouding van 1 goudmark of 1 Rijksmark met goud-clausule = 1 Duitse mark. Hierop heeft de Duitse delegatie geantwoord, dat deze vorderingen en hypotheken moeten worden bezien vanuit het gezichtspunt van de zekerheid, welke de primaire Duitse debiteur zou moeten voorstellen in een aanbod volgens de Londense Schuldenovereenkomst. Overeengekomen is, dat deze kwestie zou blijven rusten totdat de aangelegenheid van zekerheid voor de individuele verplichtingen van primaire debiteuren tot klaarheid is gebracht. De vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren behielden zich echter het recht voor, een definitieve regeling van de omzetting der verplichtingen van secundaire debiteuren in de verhouding van 1 goudmark of 1 Rijksmark met goudclausule = 1 Duitse mark te verlangen, voor het geval de zekerheden aangeboden door de Duitse primaire debiteur in een bijzonder geval niet voldoende zouden zijn.

####Overeengekomen regelingen ter opheldering van verschillende kwesties samenhangende met Bijlage VII

Aan de Voorzitter van de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor Duitse schulden, 29, Chesham Place, Londen, S.W. 1.  *Londen, 9 Februari 1953.*  Mijnheer de Voorzitter, Wij refereren aan onze brief van 21 November 1952, waarbij vier briefwisselingen waren gevoegd, bestemd om verschillende kwesties op te helderen in verband met de overeenkomst van 21 November 1952 over verplichtingen in goudmark en Rijksmark met goudclausule, die een specifiek buitenlands karakter dragen. Voorgesteld werd om ter vereenvoudiging deze vier briefwisselingen in een enkel document samen te vatten, hetwelk bij de bovengenoemde overeenkomst van 21 November 1952 gevoegd zou worden. Wij zijn het thans eens geworden over de tekst van deze bijlage en wij hebben de eer U deze in het Engels en Duits te zenden, met het verzoek haar als bijlage bij de bedoelde overeenkomst te voegen. Met de meeste hoogachting enz. (w.g.) Hermann J. ABS Hoofd van de Duitse delegatie voor de Buitenlandse schulden. (w.g.) N. J. F. LEGGETT Voorzitter van de Onderhandelingscommissie B van de Conferentie over de Duitse buitenlandse schulden. 
###Bijlage bij de Overeenkomst van 21 November 1952 over verplichtingen in goudmark en Rijksmark met goud-clausule

De navolgende bepalingen zullen een bijlage bij de Overeenkomst van 21 November 1952 vormen: 

1. Bevestigd wordt, dat de transfer van bedragen, welke verschuldigd zijn voor de betaling van vorderingen luidende in goudmark of Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie volgens de bijlagen 3 en 4 van het rapport van de Conferentie over de Duitse buitenlandse schulden, zo behandeld moet worden, alsof deze bedragen moesten worden betaald in een niet-Duitse valuta in het buitenland overeenkomstig Artikel 11 lid 1 letter (*a*) van het ontwerp voor de Intergouvernementele Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden.  

2. Overeengekomen is, dat het bestaan van een „Treuhandvertrag”, als bedoeld in de laatste alinea van artikel I, 2, van de Overeenkomst van 21 November 1952, niet alleen door een contract of door brieven, die betrekking hebben op de ,,Treuhandschaft”, bewezen kan worden, doch ook door de behandeling, welke een buitenlandse geldgever als crediteur jaren achtereen van de bevoegde Duitse instanties, welke de deviezencontrole moesten handhaven, heeft ondervonden.  

3. Overeengekomen is, dat bij hypotheken (i.e. alle zekerheid op onroerend goed), die als zekerheid dienen voor vorderingen luidende in niet-Duitse valuta, welke omgezet worden in de verhouding van 1 Duitse mark = 1 Rijksmark of 1 Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie overeenkomstig artikel 1, lid 2, cijfers 1, 2 en 5 van de 40ste Uitvoeringsverordening van de Wet op de munthervorming, deze omzetting definitief is; om deze reden is dit geval niet begrepen onder de Overeenkomst van 21 November 1952.  

4. Bij artikel V van de Overeenkomst van 21 November 1952 hebben de crediteuren zich het recht voorbehouden, ten aanzien van hun vorderingen (met inbegrip van zekerheid op onroerend goed) op secundaire debiteuren een definitieve regeling te verlangen van de omzetting in de verhouding van 1 Duitse mark = 1 goudmark of 1 Rijksmark met goud-clausule of goudoptie, voor het geval dat de door een bepaalde Duitse primaire debiteur aangeboden zekerheid ter regeling van zijn verplichting door de crediteur als onvoldoende wordt beschouwd. In dit verband zal de Voorzitter van de Duitse schulden-delegatie, de heer Hermann J. Abs, trachten de respectievelijke primaire debiteuren te bewegen onmiddellijk aan hun buitenlandse crediteuren voorstellen voor een regeling te doen, die, wanneer zij aangenomen worden, de crediteuren in een positie zullen brengen, welke in generlei opzicht ongunstiger is dan hun tegenwoordige positie, zoals deze is bepaald in de 40ste Uitvoeringsverordening van de Wet op de munthervorming. Wanneer een dergelijk aanbod wordt gedaan en aangenomen, zal worden overwogen, dat de crediteuren het door hen in het genoemde artikel V gemaakte voorbehoud terugnemen, voor zover dit betreft de omzetting van hun vorderingen tegen secundaire debiteuren. Het bedoelde voorbehoud heeft weliswaar strikt genomen slechts betrekking op crediteuren, die onder de 40ste Uitvoeringsverordening van de Wet op de munthervorming en onder artikel 15 van deze Wet (volgens de bij de Wet 46 gewijzigde tekst) vallen, d.w.z. op onderdanen van de Verenigde Naties, doch men is het er over eens, dat dit voorbehoud volgens het principe van non-discriminatie en gelijke behandeling van alle crediteuren, ook moet gelden voor vorderingen tegen secundaire debiteuren van crediteuren, die geen onderdaan van de Verenigde Naties zijn.

####Overeengekomen interpretatie van Artikel 5, lid 2, van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden

Artikel 5 lid 2 van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden mag niet zo uitgelegd worden, als zouden daardoor rechten volgens de in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland geldende wetsvoorschriften of rechten, welke op overeenkomsten berusten, die vóór de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden getekend zijn door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en een van de andere partijen van de laatstbedoelde Overeenkomst, worden aangetast.   

### BIJLAGE  IX  

####Statuut voor het Tribunaal van Arbitrage voor de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden

### Artikel  1  

(1).  Het Tribunaal van Arbitrage voor de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hierna genoemd Tribunaal van Arbitrage) bestaat uit acht permanente leden, welke als volgt worden benoemd: 

(a) drie leden door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland;  

(b) één lid door de Regering van de Franse Republiek;  

(c) één lid door de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland;  

(d) één lid door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika;  

(e) een voorzitter en een vice-voorzitter, die benoemd zullen worden gemeenschappelijk door de regeringen die gerechtigd zijn de andere permanente leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage te benoemen. Indien deze regeringen niet binnen vier maanden na het in werking treden van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hierna genoemd Overeenkomst) het eens worden over de benoeming van de voorzitter en vice-voorzitter of van een van beiden, zal de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof de benoeming of de benoemingen doen op verzoek van de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland op grond van de haar hierbij door de Partijen bij de Overeenkomst verleende machtiging.     
(2).  Wanneer een Partij bij de Overeenkomst, met uitzondering van de in lid 1 van dit Artikel genoemde regeringen, partij is in een procedure voor het Tribunaal van Arbitrage, is deze Partij gerechtigd voor deze procedure een supplementair lid te benoemen. Wanneer meer dan één Partij bij deze Overeenkomst dit recht zou hebben, wordt dit lid door hen gemeenschappelijk benoemd.   
(3).  De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland is gerechtigd een supplementair lid te benoemen voor die procedures, waaraan een volgens lid 2 van dit Artikel benoemd supplementair lid deelneemt.   
(4).  Van de eerste benoemingen van de permanente leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage moet binnen twee maanden na het in werking treden van de Overeenkomst aan de Regering van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland mededeling worden gedaan. Van de benoemingen ter vervulling van vacatures moet binnen één maand na het ontstaan daarvan mededeling worden gedaan.   
(5).  Partijen bij de Overeenkomst, die een supplementair lid volgens lid 2 van dit Artikel benoemen, moeten de benoeming aan het Tribunaal van Arbitrage mededelen binnen één maand, nadat de procedure, in verband waarmede de benoeming plaats vindt, bij het Tribunaal aanhangig is gemaakt. Wanneer de benoeming van zulk een supplementair lid niet binnen dit tijdvak aan het Tribunaal van Arbitrage is medegedeeld, zal de procedure worden gevoerd, zonder dat daaraan supplementaire leden medewerken.   
(6).  De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de benoeming van een supplementair lid, volgens lid 3 van dit Artikel, aan het Tribunaal van Arbitrage mededelen binnen één maand gerekend vanaf de dag, waarop de mededeling over de benoeming van een supplementair lid, volgens lid 2 van dit Artikel, door het Tribunaal van Arbitrage is ontvangen. Wanneer de benoeming van zulk een supplementair lid niet binnen dit tijdvak aan het Tribunaal van Arbitrage is medegedeeld, zal de procedure worden gevoerd, zonder dat dit supplementaire lid daaraan medewerkt.   

### Artikel  2  

(1).  De permanente leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage worden voor vijf jaar benoemd. Zij kunnen eenmaal of meerdere malen voor vijf jaar worden herbenoemd.   
(2).  Wanneer de voorzitter of vice-voorzitter komt te overlijden, zijn functie neerlegt of verhinderd is zijn functie uit te oefenen, zal de opvolger door de regeringen, die gerechtigd zijn de andere permanente leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage te benoemen, gemeenschappelijk benoemd worden. Indien deze regeringen niet binnen één maand na het vacant worden van de zetel het over de opvolger eens zijn geworden, zal de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof worden verzocht de benoeming te doen overeenkomstig Artikel 1 lid 1 letter (*e*) van dit Statuut.   
(3).  Wanneer een ander permanent lid als de voorzitter of vicevoorzitter komt te overlijden, zijn functie neerlegt of verhinderd is zijn functie uit te oefenen, zal de regering, die dit lid benoemd heeft, binnen twee maanden na het vacant worden van de zetel een opvolger benoemen, die de functie zal uitoefenen gedurende de rest van de tijd, waarvoor het lid, dat hij vervangt, was benoemd.   
(4).  Wanneer een permanent lid tijdelijk niet in staat is aan de zittingen van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage deel te nemen, kan de regering, die dit lid heeft benoemd, een plaatsvervanger benoemen om hem gedurende zijn afwezigheid te vervangen.   
(5).  Indien de ambtsperiode van een permanent lid verstreken is, of deze zijn functie neerlegt, moet hij toch tot de benoeming van zijn opvolger de plichten verbonden aan zijn functie blijven uitoefenen. Ook na deze benoeming moet het uitgetreden lid zijn taak ten aanzien van lopende procedures, waaraan hij heeft medegewerkt, blijven uitoefenen, totdat deze definitief zijn afgedaan, tenzij de voorzitter van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage een andere regeling treft.   
(6).  Permanente leden kunnen vóór de afloop van de termijn, voor welke zij in functie zijn, alleen van hun functie worden ontheven nadat terzake overeenstemming tussen de in Artikel 1 lid 1 van dit Statuut genoemde regeringen is bereikt; ten aanzien van leden, die door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof zijn benoemd, is daarenboven diens toestemming nodig.   

### Artikel  3

(3).  De procedure bestaat uit een schriftelijk en een mondeling gedeelte. Van de mondelinge behandeling kan op verzoek van de partijen in de procedure worden afgezien.   
(4).  Het Tribunaal van Arbitrage beslist met meerderheid van stemmen. De uitspraken worden schriftelijk gegeven; zij bevatten een uiteenzetting van de feiten en de gronden voor de beslissing, alsmede eventueel de afwijkende mening van een lid.   

### Artikel  8  

(1).  De salarissen en toelagen van de voorzitter en de vice-voorzitter worden voor de helft betaald door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en voor de andere helft voor gelijke delen door de andere regeringen, die gerechtigd zijn permanente leden te benoemen.   
(2).  De salarissen en toelagen van de andere leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage worden betaald door de regering, die het lid benoemd heeft; wanneer verschillende regeringen een lid gemeenschappelijk hebben benoemd, dragen zij gelijkelijk bij in de kosten.

### BIJLAGE  X  

####Statuut voor de Gemengde Commissie

### Artikel  1  

(1).  De Gemengde Commissie (hierna genoemd commissie) voor de interpretatie van Bijlage IV van de Overeenkomst nopens Duitse buitenlandse schulden (hierna genoemd Overeenkomst) bestaat uit de 8 permanente leden van het Tribunaal van Arbitrage, opgericht volgens Artikel 28 van de Overeenkomst, en de supplementaire leden, die van geval tot geval volgens de leden 2 en 3 van dit artikel worden benoemd; elke regering, die een permanent lid voor het Tribunaal van Arbitrage heeft benoemd, mag echter in plaats van dit permanente lid een andere persoon in de commissie benoemen.

(5).  Partijen bij de Overeenkomst, die een supplementair lid volgens lid 2 van dit artikel benoemen, moeten de benoeming aan de commissie mededelen binnen 1 maand, nadat de procedure, in verband waarmede de benoeming plaats heeft, bij haar aanhangig is gemaakt. Wanneer de benoeming van zulk een supplementair lid niet binnen dit tijdvak is medegedeeld, zal de procedure worden gevoerd zonder dat daaraan supplementaire leden medewerken.   
(6).  De Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland zal de benoeming van een supplementair lid volgens lid 3 van dit artikel aan de commissie mededelen binnen 1 maand, gerekend vanaf de dag, waarop de mededeling over de benoeming van een supplementair lid volgens lid 2 van dit artikel bij de commissie is binnengekomen.

Leden van de commissie die wel van Duitse nationaliteit zijn, zullen in zoverre niet onderworpen zijn aan eventuele gerechtelijke vervolging voor handelingen, die zij in de uitoefening van hun functie hebben verricht, als zulks het geval is ten aanzien van rechters, die zitting hebben in Duitse rechtbanken in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland.  

(b) De leden van de commissie, die niet van Duitse nationaliteit zijn, genieten binnen het gebied van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland dezelfde voorrechten en immuniteiten als aan leden van diplomatieke missies toekomen.

####Briefwisseling, waarin is neergelegd de overeenkomst van 6 Maart 1951 tussen de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika enerzijds en de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland anderzijds

### *Schrijven van de Bondskanselier aan de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie* 

*Bonn, 6 Maart 1951.*  Mijnheer de Hoge Commissaris, Ik heb de eer U in antwoord op Uw schrijven van 23 October 1950 - AGSEC (50) 2339 - het volgende mede te delen: 
###I

De Bondsrepubliek bevestigt hierbij, dat zij aansprakelijk is voor de buitenlandse vooroorlogse schulden van het Duitse Rijk, met inbegrip van die schulden van andere overheidslichamen, die later tot verplichtingen van het Rijk worden verklaard, alsmede voor de renten en andere kosten van obligaties van de Oostenrijkse Regering, voorzover dergelijke renten en kosten na 12 Maart 1938 en voor 8 Mei 1945 verschuldigd zijn geworden. De Bondsregering gaat er van uit, dat bij de vaststelling van de wijze waarop en de mate waarin de Bondsrepubliek aan deze verplichtingen moet voldoen, rekening zal worden gehouden met de algemene toestand van de Bondsrepubliek en in het bijzonder met de gevolgen van de territoriale beperking van haar jurisdictie en met haar betalingscapaciteit. 
###II

De Bondsregering erkent hierbij in principe de schulden uit hoofde van de aan Duitsland sedert 8 Mei 1945 verleende economische hulp, voorzover de aansprakelijkheid hiervoor niet reeds is erkend in de overeenkomst inzake economische samenwerking, gesloten op 15 December 1949 tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, of de Bondsrepubliek niet reeds volgens artikel 133 van de Grondwet de aansprakelijkheid hiervoor heeft overgenomen. De Bondsregering is bereid aan de verplichtingen, voortkomende uit de economische hulp, voorrang te verlenen boven alle andere buitenlandse vorderingen op Duitsland of Duitse onderdanen. De Bondsregering acht het doelmatig de met de erkenning en afwikkeling van deze schulden samenhangende kwesties te regelen in bilaterale overeenkomsten met de regeringen van de landen, die economische hulp hebben verleend, op dezelfde wijze als de met de Verenigde Staten van Amerika gesloten overeenkomst van 15 December 1949. De Bondsregering neemt aan, dat in deze overeenkomsten voor gevallen van meningsverschil een arbitrage-clausule wordt opgenomen. Zij is bereid onmiddellijk onderhandelingen te beginnen met de belanghebbende regeringen over het afsluiten van deze overeenkomsten. 
###III

De Bondsregering spreekt hierbij de wens uit de betalingen op de Duitse buitenlandse schuld te hervatten. Zij gaat ervan uit, dat tussen haar en de Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika eenstemmigheid bestaat over het volgende: Het is in het belang van een herstel van normale economische betrekkingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek en andere landen, zo spoedig mogelijk een plan uit te werken voor de regeling van openbare en particuliere vorderingen tegen Duitsland en Duitse onderdanen. De belanghebbende regeringen, met inbegrip van de Bondsrepubliek, crediteuren en debiteuren, zullen aan de uitwerking van dit plan medewerken. In het plan zullen in het bijzonder die vorderingen worden behandeld, welker regeling ertoe kan bijdragen de economische en financiële betrekkingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek en de andere landen weer normaal te maken. Hierbij zal rekening worden gehouden met de algemene economische toestand van de Bondsrepubliek, in het bijzonder met de toeneming van haar lasten en de vermindering van haar economische welstand. Het algemeen effect van dit plan mag noch de Duitse economie door ongewenste gevolgen voor de binnenlandse financiële toestand uit haar evenwicht brengen, noch bestaande of toekomstige Duitse deviezenbronnen overmatig aantasten. Het plan mag ook niet de financiële lasten voor een van de bezettende mogendheden aanmerkelijk verzwaren. Voor alle vragen, die bij de onderhandelingen over het betalingsplan en de betalingscapaciteit naar voren komen, kunnen de regeringen in kwestie de mening van deskundigen vragen. Het resultaat van de onderhandelingen zal in een overeenkomst worden neergelegd. Partijen zijn het er over eens, dat het plan slechts een voorlopig karakter draagt en zal worden herzien, zodra Duitsland herenigd is en een definitief vredesverdrag mogelijk is. Met de meeste hoogachting enz. (w.g.) ADENAUER.

### *Antwoord van de Geallieerde Hoge Commissie in naam van de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika aan de Bondskanselier* 

### *6 Maart 1951.* 

Mijnheer de Bondskanselier, In antwoord op Uw schrijven van 6 Maart 1951 betreffende de Duitse schulden hebben wij de eer, in naam van de Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, hiermede de door de Bondsregering gedane toezegging te bevestigen met betrekking tot de aansprakelijkheid van de Bondsrepubliek voor de buitenlandse vooroorlogse schulden van het Duitse Rijk alsmede voor de schulden uit hoofde van de aan Duitsland sedert 8 Mei 1945 door de drie regeringen verleende economische hulp. Wat betreft de voorrang voor de verplichtingen uit hoofde van de economische hulp uit de naoorlogse periode, zijn wij gemachtigd te verklaren, dat de drie regeringen niet het plan hebben deze voorrang op zulk een wijze geldend te maken, dat hierdoor de betaling van buitenlandse vorderingen voor handelstransacties, afgesloten na 8 Mei 1945, die voor de economische wederopbouw van de Bondsrepubliek van essentiële betekenis zijn, beperkt zou worden. Met betrekking tot de vraag over het opnemen van een arbitrageclausule in de overeenkomsten inzake de schulden uit hoofde van de economische hulp in de naoorlogse periode, zijn de drie regeringen bereid, bij de onderhandelingen over deze overeenkomsten te overwegen, of het doelmatig zou zijn zulk een clausule op te nemen voor kwesties, die in aanmerking komen om volgens een dergelijke procedure te worden geregeld. Wij hebben voorts de eer in naam van de drie regeringen de opvatting van de Bondsregering, zoals deze in de tweede alinea van punt I en in punt III van het schrijven van Uwe Excellentie tot uitdrukking is gebracht, te bevestigen. Onze regeringen zijn op het ogenblik bezig voorstellen voor te bereiden voor de uitwerking van een betalingsplan; hierbij zal rekening worden gehouden met de deelneming van buitenlandse crediteuren, Duitse debiteuren en belanghebbende regeringen, met inbegrip van de Bondsregering. De voorstellen zullen een methodische regeling beogen van alle vooroorlogse vorderingen op Duitsland en Duitse debiteuren, alsmede van de schulden uit hoofde van de economische hulp uit de naoorlogse periode; deze regeling moet een rechtvaardige en billijke behandeling van alle betrokken belangen, met inbegrip van die der Bondsregering verzekeren. Het ligt in de bedoeling de regeling welke hieruit zal voortvloeien, vast te leggen in een multilaterale overeenkomst; bilaterale overeenkomsten zullen, wanneer deze noodzakelijk worden geacht, afgesloten worden binnen het raam van het betalingsplan. Zodra hun voorstellen gereed zijn, zullen de drie regeringen deze aan de Bondsregering en de andere betrokken regeringen doen toekomen en met hen deze voorstellen en de procedure, welke hierbij zal worden gevolgd, bespreken. Wij hebben de eer te verklaren, dat onze drie regeringen het bovenaangehaalde schrijven van Uwe Excellentie en dit schrijven beschouwen als de boekstaving van een overeenkomst tussen de Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika enerzijds en de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland anderzijds terzake van de in dit schrijven behandelde vragen met betrekking tot de Duitse schulden. Deze brieven zijn in de Engelse, Franse en Duitse taal geredigeerd; deze teksten zijn gelijkelijk authentiek. Met de meeste hoogachting enz. (w.g.) A.

*(Zonder de bijlagen)*   *Londen, Februari-Augustus 1952*  
###I. Inleiding

1. De internationale conferentie over Duitse buitenlandse schulden werd door de Regeringen van de Franse Republiek, van het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Britannië en Noord-Ierland en van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika bijeengeroepen met het doel een algemene overeenkomst ter regeling van de Duitse buitenlandse schulden uit te werken. De conferentie biedt de Regeringen van de deelnemende Staten dit rapport aan waarin zij haar werkzaamheden beschrijft en haar aanbevelingen voor een regeling van deze schulden uiteenzet. De conferentie geeft in overweging dit rapport ook ter kennis te brengen van andere belanghebbende Regeringen.  

2. Vóór het bijeenroepen van deze conferentie hebben de Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika enerzijds en de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland anderzijds op 6 Maart 1951 een overeenkomst gesloten, waarin de Bondsrepubliek haar aansprakelijkheid voor de buitenlandse vooroorlogse schulden van het Duitse Rijk bevestigt, haar schulden uit hoofde van de na de oorlog door de drie Regeringen aan Duitsland verleende economische hulp in beginsel erkent en zich bereid verklaard heeft de betalingen op de Duitse buitenlandse schulden te hervatten volgens een door alle belanghebbende partijen uit te werken plan. De tekst van de briefwisseling aangaande deze overeenkomst is vervat in bijlage 1.  

3. In Mei 1951 hebben de drie Regeringen de Drie Mogendheden Commissie voor de Duitse schulden ingesteld, die de drie Regeringen bij de onderhandelingen over de regeling van de Duitse buitenlandse schulden zal vertegenwoordigen en de werkzaamheden der conferentie zal organiseren. De drie Regeringen waren in de Drie Mogendheden Commissie vertegenwoordigd door: de Heer François Didier Gregh (Frankrijk), Sir George Rendel (Verenigd Koninkrijk) en Ambassadeur Warren Lee Pierson (Verenigde Staten van Amerika). Hun plaatsvervangers waren de Heer René Sergent (Frankrijk), wiens plaats later werd ingenomen door de Heren A. Rodocanachi en H. Davost, Sir David Waley (Verenigd Koninkrijk) en Gezant J. W. Gunter (Verenigde Staten van Amerika).  

4. In Juni en Juli 1951 vonden voorbesprekingen plaats tussen de commissie en de Duitse delegatie voor buitenlandse schulden, die door de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland was aangewezen, alsmede vertegenwoordigers van enkele der belangrijkste crediteur staten. Leider van de Duitse delegatie voor buitenlandse schulden was de Heer Hermann J. Abs met als plaatsvervanger Dr W. Kriege.  

5. In December 1951 stelde de Drie Mogendheden Commissie de Duitse delegatie in kennis van de bedragen en de betalingsmodaliteiten, die de drie Regeringen als volledige betaling van hun aanspraken uit hoofde van de na de oorlog verleende economische hulp bereid waren te aanvaarden, op voorwaarde dat een bevredigende en billijke regeling voor de Duitse vooroorlogse schulden tot stand zou komen. Gedurende de conferentie verklaarden de Verenigde Staten van Amerika zich bovendien bereid om, onder wijziging van hun aanbod van December 1951 op dit punt, de aanvangsdatum van de amortisatiebetalingen op hun vordering vijf jaar op te schorten. De bedragen en betalingsmodaliteiten zijn neergelegd in bijlage 2 bij dit rapport.   
###II. Organisatie van de conferentie

6. De eerste plenaire zitting van de conferentie vond op 28 Februari 1952 plaats in het Lancaster House te Londen. De Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika waren daarbij vertegenwoordigd door de Drie Mogendheden Commissie; de particuliere crediteuren van deze drie landen waren vertegenwoordigd door afzonderlijke delegaties. Door 22 crediteurlanden werden delegaties afgevaardigd, die samengesteld waren uit regeringsvertegenwoordigers en ten dele ook uit vertegenwoordigers van particuliere crediteuren; drie landen zonden waarnemers; de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen was als zelfstandige crediteur vertegenwoordigd; de delegatie van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland bestond uit regeringsvertegenwoordigers en vertegenwoordigers van de particuliere debiteuren.  

7. Overeenkomstig de besluiten van de conferentie werden de volgende comité’s ingesteld: 

(a) Een besturend comité, bestaande uit de drie leden van de Drie Mogendheden Commissie, 13 vertegenwoordigers van de belangen van crediteuren uit België, Brazilië, Frankrijk, Italië, Nederland, Zweden, Zwitserland, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten, alsmede 5 vertegenwoordigers van de zijde der debiteuren, zowel voor openbare als particuliere schulden. Dit comité had tot taak de werkzaamheden van de conferentie te organiseren en er zorg voor te dragen dat alle aanbevelingen die aan de plenaire zittingen werden voorgelegd dienstig zouden zijn voor een billijke algemene regeling en een gelijke behandeling van alle crediteuren binnen iedere afzonderlijke groep.  

(b) Het crediteuren-comité, waarin alle delegaties van de crediteurlanden vertegenwoordigd waren. Het had tot taak de meningen van de verschillende groepen van crediteuren te coördineren, vertegenwoordigers te benoemen voor de onderhandelingscommissies en het besturend comité in kennis te stellen van de opvatting van de crediteuren over alle aanbevelingen, waartoe in de onderhandelingscommissies was besloten.  

(c) Het Secretariaat van het comité onder leiding van een Secretaris-Generaal, de Heer H. A. Cridland, later vervangen door de Heer E. H. Peck.    

8. Het besturend comité stelde 4 onderhandelingscommissies in, ter behandeling van de volgende categorieën van schulden:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| Commissie A:  | schulden van het Rijk en van andere openbare lichamen.  |
| Commissie B:  | in effecten belichaamde schulden van het Duitse bedrijfsleven.  |
| Commissie C:  | Stillhalteschulden.  |
| Commissie D:  | handelsschulden en overige verplichtingen.  |

Deze commissies waren samengesteld uit vertegenwoordigers van de crediteuren en van de debiteuren alsmede uit waarnemers van de Drie Mogendheden Commissie. Een aantal sub-commissies werden door de onderhandelingscommissies ingesteld ter behandeling van speciale soorten schulden.  

9. Voorts stelde het besturend comité een statistische commissie in tot bijstand van de conferentie.  

10. De conferentie vond plaats in de tijd van 28 Februari tot 8 Augustus 1952, met een onderbreking van 5 April tot 19 Mei teneinde het de delegaties mogelijk te maken ruggespraak te houden.   
###III. Richtlijnen voor het opstellen van de aanbevelingen

11. Bij haar werkzaamheden heeft de conferentie zich gebaseerd op de volgende feiten, beginselen en doeleinden: 

(a) De Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika hebben de Regering van de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland verzekeringen gegeven ten aanzien van de reductie van de naoorlogse vorderingen uit hoofde van de aan Duitsland verleende economische hulp en met betrekking tot de modaliteiten, die voor de drie Regeringen aannemelijk zijn, op voorwaarde dat een bevredigende en billijke regeling voor de vooroorlogse schulden tot stand komt.  

(b) Het plan voor de regeling moest: 

(i) rekening houden met de algemene economische toestand van de Bondsrepubliek en met de gevolgen van de territoriale beperkingen van haar jurisdictie; het moest de Duitse economie niet ontwrichten door ongewenste gevolgen voor de binnenlandse financiële situatie, noch aanwezige of toekomstige Duitse deviezenbronnen overmatig aantasten; evenmin moest het de financiële lasten van een der drie Regeringen aanmerkelijk verzwaren;  

(ii) methodische algemene regelingen inhouden en een rechtvaardige en billijke behandeling van alle betrokken belangen verzekeren;  

(iii) geëigende bepalingen inhouden voor het geval van een hereniging van Duitsland.    

(c) Het plan voor de regeling moest het herstel van normale financiële en economische betrekkingen tussen de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland en andere landen bevorderen. Met het oog hierop moest de regeling: 

(i) een einde maken aan het in gebreke zijn van Duitsland door een doelmatige regeling voor reeds vervallen en nog vervallende schulden en voor achterstallige renten;  

(ii) een toestand scheppen die de hervatting van normale betrekkingen tussen debiteuren en crediteuren mogelijk zou maken;  

(iii) van dien aard zijn, dat zij zou bijdragen tot het herstel van het internationale crediet van Duitsland door het herleven van het vertrouwen in de financiële standing en de betrouwbaarheid van Duitsland als credietnemer, en tegelijkertijd gepaste zekerheid zou bieden, dat Duitsland niet opnieuw in gebreke raakt ten aanzien van de verplichtingen, die het op zich neemt;  

(iv) verenigbaar zijn met de verplichtingen - en deze zoveel mogelijk vergemakkelijken -, die de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland als lid van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en de Organisatie voor Europese Economische Samenwerking op zich nemen zal of reeds op zich genomen heeft met het oog op de transfer van betalingen op lopende transacties, met inbegrip van renten en opbrengsten uit kapitaal.       
###IV. Aanbevelingen

12. *Schulden van het Rijk en van andere openbare lichamen.* De aanbevelingen voor de regeling van deze schulden zijn vervat in bijlage 3.  

13. *In obligaties belichaamde schulden van het Duitse bedrijfsleven.* De aanbevelingen voor de regeling van deze schulden zijn vervat in bijlage 4.  

14. *Stillhalteschulden.* De aanbevelingen voor de regeling van deze schulden zijn vervat in bijlage 5. De conferentie is van oordeel, dat deze aanbevelingen zo spoedig mogelijk in werking moeten treden.  

15. *Handelsschulden en overige verplichtingen.* De aanbevelingen voor de regeling van deze schulden zijn vervat in bijlage 6.  

16. De conferentie heeft verschillende problemen onderzocht met betrekking tot schulden, waarvan het speciale karakter een volledige en definitieve regeling tijdens de conferentie niet toeliet. Er werden plannen gemaakt om tot een latere oplossing daarvan te komen door onderhandelingen tussen de belanghebbende groepen. De desbetreffende bepalingen zijn opgenomen in de daarop betrekking hebbende bijlagen bij dit rapport. De onderhandelingen moeten plaats vinden binnen het raam van de grondbeginselen en van de doeleinden van de conferentie. De eruit voortvloeiende aanbevelingen zullen, indien zij aanvaard worden, deel uitmaken van de internationale overeenkomst.  

17. De voorgestelde voorwaarden voor de regeling van de onder het plan vallende Duitse schulden zijn uitgewerkt in diepgaande onderhandelingen tussen vertegenwoordigers van de crediteuren en van de debiteuren. Zij passen zich zo eng mogelijk aan aan de bestaande contracten.  

18. Zoals uit bijlagen 3 tot 6 blijkt zal op de hoofdsommen van alle onder de aanbevelingen vallende schulden gedurende een aanlooptijd van 5 jaar geen terugbetaling in buitenlandse valuta plaats vinden, met uitzondering van bijzondere gevallen voor welke de aanbevolen voorwaarden voor een regeling bepalingen bevatten, die bepaalde terugbetalingen van de hoofdsom gedurende de aanlooptijd toelaatbaar maken.  

19. Passende bepalingen voor de behandeling van gevallen, waarbij de debiteur zich in een moeilijke financiële positie bevindt, zijn in de bijlagen opgenomen. Is een debiteur, die verschillende buitenlandse leningen heeft uitstaan, niet in staat aan zijn verplichtingen uit de schuldenovereenkomst te voldoen, dan moeten tussen de debiteur en zijn crediteuren te voeren onderhandelingen aldus plaats vinden, dat een gelijke bescherming van de belangen der verschillende crediteuren gewaarborgd wordt.  

20. De regeling van de schulden van de stad Berlijn of openbare nutsbedrijven, die eigendom zijn van de stad Berlijn of door haar worden gecontroleerd, wordt voorlopig uitgesteld. Daarentegen moeten particuliere debiteuren woonachtig in de Westelijke sectoren van Berlijn behandeld worden als inwoners van de Bondsrepubliek.  

21. De in par. 38 genoemde internationale overeenkomst moet erin voorzien dat de Bondsregering de transfer van renten en amortisatiebetalingen, in overeenstemming met het plan voor de regeling, zal hervatten en alles zal doen wat in haar macht ligt om deze transfer te waarborgen. De conferentie heeft het beginsel aanvaard dat de transfer van betalingen, als bedoeld in het plan voor een regeling, de ontwikkeling en instandhouding impliceert van een stand van de betalingsbalans, waarbij deze betalingen en andere betalingen voor lopende transacties kunnen worden gedekt door inkomsten aan deviezen uit export en onzichtbare transacties, zodat meer dan een voorbijgaand gebruik van valuta-reserves wordt vermeden. Hierbij moet voldoende rekening worden gehouden met het feit dat een vrije convertibiliteit van de valuta's nog niet hersteld is. Derhalve heeft de conferentie erkend, dat de ontwikkeling en de instandhouding van deze stand van de betalingsbalans vergemakkelijkt moet worden door verdere internationale samenwerking in de zin van een meer liberale handelspolitiek, uitbreiding van de wereldhandel en het herstel van de vrije convertibiliteit der valuta's. Zij beveelt aan dat alle belanghebbenden in voldoende mate rekening zullen houden met de in deze paragraaf neergelegde principes. Bij de voorbereiding van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst moet aandacht geschonken worden aan het uitwerken van bepalingen waarvan het doel zal zijn te waarborgen, dat het plan ten genoege van alle belanghebbenden zal worden gehandhaafd en uitgevoerd, met inbegrip van bepalingen die toepassing zullen vinden in het geval dat de Bondsrepubliek, ondanks haar uiterste inspanning, voor moeilijkheden zal komen te staan bij het nakomen van haar verplichtingen uit hoofde van het plan.  

22. Transferbetalingen voor rente en amortisatie, verschuldigd op grond van het plan voor een regeling, moeten behandeld worden als betalingen voor lopende transacties en, voorzover dit in aanmerking komt, als betalingen die begrepen zijn in de handels- en betalingsovereenkomsten tussen de Bondsrepubliek en ieder van de crediteurlanden; hierbij is het onverschillig of het gaat om bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten.  

23. Bij de toepassing van de overeengekomen voorwaarden zal de Bondsregering geen discriminatie of bevoordeling toestaan met betrekking tot afzonderlijke soorten van schulden, de verschuldigde valuta's of in een ander opzicht, en de crediteurlanden zullen zulks ook niet verlangen.  

24. De Bondsregering zal de voor de toepassing van het plan vereiste wettelijke en administratieve maatregelen treffen o.m. om de buitenlandse crediteuren het recht te verschaffen hun aanspraken af te dwingen voor Duitse gerechten.  

25. De basis voor de in het plan bedoelde regelingen wordt gevormd door een door de debiteur aan de crediteur gemaakt of te maken aanbod. Zelfs indien een dergelijk aanbod aanbevolen is door de vertegenwoordigers van crediteuren of berust op een uitspraak van een scheidsgerecht (tenzij uitdrukkelijk overeengekomen is dat een dergelijke uitspraak voor de belanghebbende crediteur bindend is) is de crediteur vrij het af te wijzen. Echter heeft hij in dat geval geen aanspraak op de voordelen die verbonden zijn aan het plan voor de regeling. De Bondsregering heeft het recht hiermede bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van par. 24 rekening te houden.  

26. In de intergouvernementele overeenkomst zal worden vastgelegd, dat bij aanvaarding van een aanbod, voorzover krachtens het plan voor de regeling de oorspronkelijke schuldverhouding tussen crediteur en debiteur daarbij wordt gewijzigd of een nieuwe overeenkomst tussen crediteur en debiteur wordt afgesloten, de debiteur na de op grond daarvan vastgestelde verplichtingen volledig te zijn nagekomen, zowel wat betreft zijn verplichtingen uit hoofde van de gewijzigde of nieuwe schuldverhouding als uit hoofde van de oorspronkelijke schuldverhouding, finaal gekweten zal zijn.  

27. De verjaringstermijnen van vorderingen, bedoeld in het plan voor een regeling, lopen niet door gedurende de periode tussen het tijdstip, waarop de bedragen, verschuldigd op grond van de oorspronkelijke overeenkomst niet meer beschikbaar waren voor de crediteuren, en het tijdstip, waarop de verschuldigde bedragen volgens het plan voor een regeling beschikbaar komen. Daarenboven zal de verjaring niet kunnen worden ingeroepen ten aanzien van de rechten van buitenlandse houders van binnenlandse Duitse effecten (met inbegrip van wissels), vóór het verstrijken van een jaar nadat de transfer in valuta voor rente en dividenden uit die effecten mogelijk is geworden. De Bondsregering zal de vereiste maatregelen nemen om de nakoming van dit principe te verzekeren.  

28. Zekere leningsovereenkomsten houden een valuta-optie-clausule in, hetgeen wil zeggen, dat de crediteur naar zijn keuze betaling kan verlangen in een andere overeengekomen valuta als die van het land van uitgifte der lening. Ook andere overeenkomsten kunnen dergelijke bepalingen inhouden. Deze kwestie moet door de deelnemende regeringen verder worden bezien, met het doel om vóór het afsluiten van de intergouvernementele overeenkomst tot volledige overeenstemming te geraken. Onverminderd een op deze wijze te bereiken overeenkomst over de valuta waarin de betaling moet plaatsvinden, zullen valuta-optieclausules in die gevallen, waarin het contract in de betaling van een vaststaand bedrag in de andere valuta voorziet, gelden als een valutagarantie; zo zou bv. een crediteur, die houder is van een aanspraak op grond van een leningsovereenkomst met een dergelijke valutaoptie-clausule aanspraak hebben op de tegenwaarde in de valuta van het land van uitgifte van het bedrag, dat in de andere valuta betaald had moeten worden, indien van de optie gebruik gemaakt was. Hierbij wordt de wisselkoers, geldend op de vervaldag, toegepast.  

29. Met het oog op de overeengekomen aanbevelingen en de daarin voorgestelde regelingen geldt, voorzover niet anders is bepaald (bv. in het geval van de Young-lening), het volgende: Schulden, luidende in goud-dollar of Zwitserse goudfranken moeten worden omgerekend in de verhouding 1 U.S.-$ = 1 goud-$ en 1 Zwitserse frank = 1 Zwitserse goudfrank. De nieuwe overeenkomsten luiden dus in gangbare dollars en gangbare Zwitserse franken. Andere schulden met een goud-clausule (uitgezonderd in Duitse valuta luidende schulden met een goud-clausule - zie bijlagen 4 en 6) zijn uitsluitend betaalbaar in de valuta van het land, waar de lening is geplaatst of de uitgifte heeft plaats gevonden (hierna te noemen valuta van uitgifte). Het verschuldigde bedrag wordt berekend als de tegenwaarde van een dollarbedrag, op basis van de wisselkoers, geldend op de vervaldag. Dit dollarbedrag wordt aldus verkregen, dat de nominale waarde tegen de op het tijdstip van de plaatsing of de uitgifte der lening geldende wisselkoers wordt omgerekend in U.S.-$. Het aldus berekende bedrag in de valuta van uitgifte mag echter niet lager zijn dan wanneer het berekend was volgens de wisselkoers, die gold op 1 Augustus 1952.  

30. Met betrekking tot de vraag van goud-clausules in het algemeen deelde de Drie Mogendheden Commissie aan de conferentie mede, dat de Regeringen van Frankrijk, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika in verband met de getroffen overeenkomsten, waardoor een algemene regeling van het probleem van de Duitse schulden mogelijk moet worden gemaakt, besloten hebben dat, voorzover het gaat om de regeling van Duitse schulden, goudclausules niet zullen worden gehandhaafd maar dat deze vervangen kunnen worden door deviezengaranties in welke vorm dan ook. Wat betreft de Young-lening acht de Drie Mogendheden Commissie het essentieel, dat de gelijkheid van behandeling der verschillende uitgiften in stand wordt gehouden, zoals zulks is geregeld in de overeenkomst terzake van die lening. De vertegenwoordigers van de Europese houders hebben hun leedwezen uitgesproken over de beslissing, afstand te moeten doen van hun contractuele aanspraak ten aanzien van deze internationale lening op betaling in de eigen valuta op goud-basis. Zij hebben daarom in de „overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor de regeling van schulden van het Rijk en andere publiekrechtelijke lichamen” (bijlage 3) uitsluitend een overeenkomstige bepaling opgenomen in verband met deze door de regeringen genomen beslissing. Overeenkomstige bepalingen zijn vervat in andere rapporten, waar zulks te pas kwam.  

31. Als bijlage 7 zijn bijgevoegd de overeengekomen aanbevelingen voor de behandeling van stortingen bij de Konversionskasse.  

32. Duitse mark-tegoeden, welke zich voor een buitenlandse crediteur vormen als gevolg van de voldoening van Duitse schulden, die onder de Overeenkomst vallen, zullen mogen worden gebruikt binnen het kader van de thans in de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland geldende desbetreffende bepalingen. Zulks met inbegrip van de overdracht der tegoeden aan andere niet in Duitsland woonachtige personen. Overeengekomen aanbevelingen over het gebruik van Duitse mark-tegoeden zijn vervat in bijlage 8.  

33. De vraag werd overwogen of het gewenst zou zijn het uitvaardigen van wettelijke voorschriften in de crediteurlanden aan te bevelen, waardoor de activiteiten van afzonderlijke crediteuren met het doel om voldoening te verkrijgen van hun aanspraken tegen Duitsland, beperkt zouden worden. De conferentie kwam echter tot de conclusie dat dergelijke wettelijke voorschriften niet van essentiële betekenis zijn voor een met succes tot uitvoering brengen van het plan voor een regeling.  

34. De conferentie acht de in dit rapport neergelegde aanbevelingen in overeenstemming te zijn met de in par. 11 vervatte principes.  

35. De vertegenwoordigers der particuliere crediteuren die aan de conferentie hebben deelgenomen, zullen de individuele crediteuren aanraden de modaliteiten van dit plan voor een regeling, voorzover zij daarbij betrokken zijn, te aanvaarden.  

36. De Bondsregering zal zich verplichten de technische voorbereidselen, die nodig zijn om deze voorstellen tot uitvoering te brengen op de data, die voorzien zijn in de bijlagen, te bespoedigen.  

37. De conferentie geeft uitdrukking aan de hoop dat de trustees die leningen administreren, bereid zullen worden gevonden zich beschikbaar te stellen voor de uitvoering van dit plan voor een regeling.  

38. In het belang van een herstel van het Duitse buitenlandse crediet en in het belang van de crediteuren wier aanspraken sedert vele jaren ongeregeld gebleven zijn, zullen de deelnemende regeringen onverwijld de aanbevelingen, die in dit rapport zijn neergelegd, in behandeling nemen met het doel een intergouvernementele overeenkomst te sluiten teneinde aan het plan voor een regeling der schulden internationale gelding te verlenen en tegelijkertijd de schulden van de Bondsrepubliek uit hoofde van de naoorlogse economische hulp te regelen.   Aangenomen in de plenaire zitting van de conferentie op Vrijdag, de 8e Augustus 1952.
