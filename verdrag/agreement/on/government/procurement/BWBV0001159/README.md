### Article  I  

####Scope and Coverage

1.  This Agreement applies to any law, regulation, procedure or practice regarding any procurement by entities covered by this Agreement, as specified in Appendix I. <sup> 1)  For each Party, Appendix I is divided into five Annexes:    -  Annex 1 contains central government entities.    -  Annex 2 contains sub-central government entities.    -  Annex 3 contains all other entities that procure in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.    -  Annex 4 specifies services, whether listed positively or negatively, covered by this Agreement.    -  Annex 5 specifies covered construction services.     Relevant thresholds are specified in each Party's Annexes.  </sup>   
2.  This Agreement applies to procurement by any contractual means, including through such methods as purchase or as lease, rental or hire purchase, with or without an option to buy, including any combination of products and services.   
3.  Where entities, in the context of procurement covered under this Agreement, require enterprises not included in Appendix I to award contracts in accordance with particular requirements, Article III shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to such requirements.   
4.  This Agreement applies to any procurement contract of a value of not less than the relevant threshold specified in Appendix I.   

### Article  II  

####Valuation of Contracts

1.  The following provisions shall apply in determining the value of contracts for purposes of implementing this Agreement. <sup> 2)  This Agreement shall apply to any procurement contract for which the contract value is estimated to equal or exceed the threshold at the time of publication of the notice in accordance with Article IX.  </sup>   
2.  Valuation shall take into account all forms of remuneration, including any premiums, fees, commissions and interest receivable.   
3.  The selection of the valuation method by the entity shall not be used, nor shall any procurement requirement be divided, with the intention of avoiding the application of this Agreement.   
4.  If an individual requirement for a procurement results in the award of more than one contract, or in contracts being awarded in separate parts, the basis for valuation shall be either: 

a) the actual value of similar recurring contracts concluded over the previous fiscal year or 12 months adjusted, where possible, for anticipated changes in quantity and value over the subsequent 12 months; or  

b) the estimated value of recurring contracts in the fiscal year or 12 months subsequent to the initial contract.     
5.  In cases of contracts for the lease, rental or hire purchase of products or services, or in the case of contracts which do not specify a total price, the basis for valuation shall be: 

a) in the case of fixed-term contracts, where their term is 12 months or less, the total contract value for their duration, or, where their term exceeds 12 months, their total value including the estimated residual value;  

b) in the case of contracts for an indefinite period, the monthly instalment multiplied by 48.   If there is any doubt, the second basis for valuation, namely (b), is to be used.   
6.  In cases where an intended procurement specifies the need for option clauses, the basis for valuation shall be the total value of the maximum permissible procurement, inclusive of optional purchases.   

### Article  III  

####National Treatment and Non-discrimination

1.  With respect to all laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Agreement, each Party shall provide immediately and unconditionally to the products, services and suppliers of other Parties offering products or services of the Parties, treatment no less favourable than: 

a) that accorded to domestic products, services and suppliers; and  

b) that accorded to products, services and suppliers of any other Party.     
2.  With respect to all laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Agreement, each Party shall ensure: 

a) that its entities shall not treat a locally-established supplier less favourably than another locally-established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; and  

b) that its entities shall not discriminate against locally-established suppliers on the basis of the country of production of the good or service being supplied, provided that the country of production is a Party to the Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article IV.     
3.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation, the method of levying such duties and charges, other import regulations and formalities, and measures affecting trade in services other than laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Agreement.   

### Article  IV  

####Rules of Origin

1.  A Party shall not apply rules of origin to products or services imported or supplied for purposes of government procurement covered by this Agreement from other Parties, which are different from the rules of origin applied in the normal course of trade and at the time of the transaction in question to imports or supplies of the same products or services from the same Parties.   
2.  Following the conclusion of the work programme for the harmonization of rules of origin for goods to be undertaken under the Agreement on Rules of Origin in Annex 1A of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as "WTO Agreement") and negotiations regarding trade in services, Parties shall take the results of that work programme and those negotiations into account in amending paragraph 1 as appropriate.   

### Article  V  

####Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries

### *Objectives*

### *Coverage* 

3.  With a view to ensuring that developing countries are able to adhere to this Agreement on terms consistent with their development, financial and trade needs, the objectives listed in paragraph 1 shall be duly taken into account in the course of negotiations with respect to the procurement of developing countries to be covered by the provisions of this Agreement.

### *Agreed Exclusions* 

4.  A developing country may negotiate with other participants in negotiations under this Agreement mutually acceptable exclusions from the rules on national treatment with respect to certain entities, products or services that are included in its coverage lists, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case. In such negotiations, the considerations mentioned in subparagraphs 1a) through 1c) shall be duly taken into account. A developing country participating in regional or global arrangements among developing countries referred to in subparagraph 1d) may also negotiate exclusions to its lists, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case, taking into account, *inter alia,* the provisions on government procurement provided for in the regional or global arrangements concerned and, in particular, products or services which may be subject to common industrial development programmes.   
5.  After entry into force of this Agreement, a developing country Party may modify its coverage lists in accordance with the provisions for modification of such lists contained in paragraph 6 of Article XXIV, having regard to its development, financial and trade needs, or may request the Committee on Government Procurement (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") to grant exclusions from the rules on national treatment for certain entities, products or services that are included in its coverage lists, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case and taking duly into account the provisions of subparagraphs 1a) through 1c). After entry into force of this Agreement, a developing country Party may also request the Committee to grant exclusions, for certain entities, products or services that are included in its coverage lists in the light of its participation in regional or global arrangements among developing countries, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case and taking duly into account the provisions of subparagraph 1d). Each request to the Committee by a developing country Party relating to modification of a list shall be accompanied by documentation relevant to the request or by such information as may be necessary for consideration of the matter.   
6.  Paragraphs 4 and 5 shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to developing countries acceding to this Agreement after its entry into force.   
7.  Such agreed exclusions as mentioned in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall be subject to review in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 14 below.  
### *Technical Assistance for Developing country Parties* 

8.  Each developed country Party shall, upon request, provide all technical assistance which it may deem appropriate to developing country Parties in resolving their problems in the field of government procurement.   
9.  This assistance, which shall be provided on the basis of nondiscrimination among developing country Parties, shall relate, *inter alia,* to: 

- the solution of particular technical problems relating to the award of a specific contract; and  

- any other problem which the Party making the request and another Party agree to deal with in the context of this assistance.     
10.  Technical assistance referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 would include translation of qualification documentation and tenders made by suppliers of developing country Parties into an official language of the WTO designated by the entity, unless developed country Parties deem translation to be burdensome, and in that case explanation shall be given to developing country Parties upon their request addressed either to the developed country Parties or to their entities.  
### *Information Centres* 

11.  Developed country Parties shall establish, individually or jointly, information centres to respond to reasonable requests from developing country Parties for information relating to, *inter alia,* laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement, notices about intended procurements which have been published, addresses of the entities covered by this Agreement, and the nature and volume of products or services procured or to be procured, including available information about future tenders. The Committee may also set up an information centre.  
### *Special Treatment for Least-Developed Countries* 

12.  Having regard to paragraph 6 of the Decision of the CONTRACTING PARTIES to GATT 1947 of 28 November 1979 on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries (BISD 26S/203-205), special treatment shall be granted to least-developed country Parties and to the suppliers in those Parties with respect to products or services originating in those Parties, in the context of any general or specific measures in favour of developing country Parties. A Party may also grant the benefits of this Agreement to suppliers in least-developed countries which are not Parties, with respect to products or services originating in those countries.   
13.  Each developed country Party shall, upon request, provide assistance which it may deem appropriate to potential tenderers in least-developed countries in submitting their tenders and selecting the products or services which are likely to be of interest to its entities as well as to suppliers in least-developed countries, and likewise assist them to comply with technical regulations and standards relating to products or services which are the subject of the intended procurement.  
### *Review* 

14.  The Committee shall review annually the operation and effectiveness of this Article and, after each three years of its operation on the basis of reports to be submitted by Parties, shall carry out a major review in order to evaluate its effects. As part of the three-yearly reviews and with a view to achieving the maximum implementation of the provisions of this Agreement, including in particular Article III, and having regard to the development, financial and trade situation of the developing countries concerned, the Committee shall examine whether exclusions provided for in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 through 6 of this Article shall be modified or extended.   
15.  In the course of further rounds of negotiations in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article XXIV, each developing country Party shall give consideration to the possibility of enlarging its coverage lists, having regard to its economic, financial and trade situation.   

### Article  VI  

####Technical Specifications

1.  Technical specifications laying down the characteristics of the products or services to be procured, such as quality, performance, safety and dimensions, symbols, terminology, packaging, marking and labelling, or the processes and methods for their production and requirements relating to conformity assessment procedures prescribed by procuring entities, shall not be prepared, adopted or applied with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.   
2.  Technical specifications prescribed by procuring entities shall, where appropriate 

a) be in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and  

b) be based on international standards, where such exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations , recognized national standards , or building codes. <sup> 1)  For the purpose of this Agreement, a technical regulation is a document which lays down characteristics of a product or a service or their related processes and production methods, including the applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling requirements as they apply to a product, service, process or production method.  </sup> <sup> 2)  For the purpose of this Agreement, a standard is a document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or services or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling requirements as they apply to a product, service, process or production method.  </sup>     
3.  There shall be no requirement or reference to a particular trade-mark or trade name, patent, design or type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that words such as "or equivalent" are included in the tender documentation.   
4.  Entities shall not seek or accept, in a manner which would have the effect of precluding competition, advice which may be used in the preparation of specifications for a specific procurement from a firm that may have a commercial interest in the procurement.   

### Article  VII  

####Tendering Procedures

1.  Each Party shall ensure that the tendering procedures of its entities are applied in a non-discriminatory manner and are consistent with the provisions contained in Articles VII through XVI.   
2.  Entities shall not provide to any supplier information with regard to a specific procurement in a manner which would have the effect of precluding competition.   
3.  For the purposes of this Agreement: 

a) Open tendering procedures are those procedures under which all interested suppliers may submit a tender.  

b) Selective tendering procedures are those procedures under which, consistent with paragraph 3 of Article X and other relevant provisions of this Agreement, those suppliers invited to do so by the entity may submit a tender.  

c) Limited tendering procedures are those procedures where the entity contacts suppliers individually, only under the conditions specified in Article XV.     

### Article  VIII  

####Qualification of Suppliers

In the process of qualifying suppliers, entities shall not discriminate among suppliers of other Parties or between domestic suppliers and suppliers of other Parties. Qualification procedures shall be consistent with the following: 

a) any conditions for participation in tendering procedures shall be published in adequate time to enable interested suppliers to initiate and, to the extent that it is compatible with efficient operation of the procurement process, complete the qualification procedures;  

b) any conditions for participation in tendering procedures shall be limited to those which are essential to ensure the firm's capability to fulfil the contract in question. Any conditions for participation required from suppliers, including financial guarantees, technical qualifications and information necessary for establishing the financial, commercial and technical capacity of suppliers, as well as the verification of qualifications, shall be no less favourable to suppliers of other Parties than to domestic suppliers and shall not discriminate among suppliers of other Parties. The financial, commercial and technical capacity of a supplier shall be judged on the basis both of that supplier's global business activity as well as of its activity in the territory of the procuring entity, taking due account of the legal relationship between the supply organizations;  

c) the process of, and the time required for, qualifying suppliers shall not be used in order to keep suppliers of other Parties off a suppliers' list or from being considered for a particular intended procurement. Entities shall recognize as qualified suppliers such domestic suppliers or suppliers of other Parties who meet the conditions for participation in a particular intended procurement. Suppliers requesting to participate in a particular intended procurement who may not yet be qualified shall also be considered, provided there is sufficient time to complete the qualification procedure;  

d) entities maintaining permanent lists of qualified suppliers shall ensure that suppliers may apply for qualification at any time; and that all qualified suppliers so requesting are included in the lists within a reasonably short time;  

e) if, after publication of the notice under paragraph 1 of Article IX, a supplier not yet qualified requests to participate in an intended procurement, the entity shall promptly start procedures for qualification;  

f) any supplier having requested to become a qualified supplier shall be advised by the entities concerned of the decision in this regard. Qualified suppliers included on permanent lists by entities shall also be notified of the termination of any such lists or of their removal from them;  

g) each Party shall ensure that: 

i) each entity and its constituent parts follow a single qualification procedure, except in cases of duly substantiated need for a different procedure; and  

ii) efforts be made to minimize differences in qualification procedures between entities.    

h) nothing in subparagraphs a) through g) shall preclude the exclusion of any supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy or false declarations, provided that such an action is consistent with the national treatment and non-discrimination provisions of this Agreement.    

### Article  IX  

####Invitation to Participate Regarding Intended Procurement

1.  In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, entities shall publish an invitation to participate for all cases of intended procurement, except as otherwise provided for in Article XV (limited tendering). The notice shall be published in the appropriate publication listed in Appendix II.   
2.  The invitation to participate may take the form of a notice of proposed procurement, as provided for in paragraph 6.   
3.  Entities in Annexes 2 and 3 may use a notice of planned procurement, as provided for in paragraph 7, or a notice regarding a qualification system, as provided for in paragraph 9, as an invitation to participate.   
4.  Entities which use a notice of planned procurement as an invitation to participate shall subsequently invite all suppliers who have expressed an interest to confirm their interest on the basis of information which shall include at least the information referred to in paragraph 6.   
5.  Entities which use a notice regarding a qualification system as an invitation to participate shall provide, subject to the considerations referred to in paragraph 4 of Article XVIII and in a timely manner, information which allows all those who have expressed an interest to have a meaningful opportunity to assess their interest in participating in the procurement . This information shall include the information contained in the notices referred to in paragraphs 6 and 8, to the extent such information is available. Information provided to one interested supplier shall be provided in a non-discriminatory manner to the other interested suppliers.   
6.  Each notice of proposed procurement, referred to in paragraph 2, shall contain the following information: 

a) the nature and quantity, including any options for further procurement and, if possible, an estimate of the timing when such options may be exercised; in the case of recurring contracts the nature and quantity and, if possible, an estimate of the timing of the subsequent tender notices for the products or services to be procured;  

b) whether the procedure is open or selective or will involve negotiation;  

c) any date for starting delivery or completion of delivery of goods or services;  

d) the address and final date for submitting an application to be invited to tender or for qualifying for the suppliers' lists, or for receiving tenders, as well as the language or languages in which they must be submitted;  

e) the address of the entity awarding the contract and providing any information necessary for obtaining specifications and other documents;  

f) any economic and technical requirements, financial guarantees and information required from suppliers;  

g) the amount and terms of payment of any sum payable for the tender documentation; and  

h) whether the entity is inviting offers for purchase, lease, rental or hire purchase, or more than one of these methods.     
7.  Each notice of planned procurement referred to in paragraph 3 shall contain as much of the information referred to in paragraph 6 as is available. It shall in any case include the information referred to in paragraph 8 and: 

a) a statement that interested suppliers should express their interest in the procurement to the entity;  

b) a contact point with the entity from which further information may be obtained.     
8.  For each case of intended procurement, the entity shall publish a summary notice in one of the official languages of the WTO. The notice shall contain at least the following information: 

a) the subject matter of the contract;  

b) the time-limits set for the submission of tenders or an application to be invited to tender; and  

c) the addresses from which documents relating to the contracts may be requested.     
9.  In the case of selective tendering procedures, entities maintaining permanent lists of qualified suppliers shall publish annually in one of the publications listed in Appendix III a notice of the following: 

a) the enumeration of the lists maintained, including their headings, in relation to the products or services or categories of products or services to be procured through the lists;  

b) the conditions to be fulfilled by suppliers with a view to their inscription on those lists and the methods according to which each of those conditions will be verified by the entity concerned; and  

c) the period of validity of the lists, and the formalities for their renewal.   When such a notice is used as an invitation to participate in accordance with paragraph 3, the notice shall, in addition, include the following information: 

d) the nature of the products or services concerned;  

e) a statement that the notice constitutes an invitation to participate.   However, when the duration of the qualification system is three years or less, and if the duration of the system is made clear in the notice and it is also made clear that further notices will not be published, it shall be sufficient to publish the notice once only, at the beginning of the system. Such a system shall not be used in a manner which circumvents the provisions of this Agreement.   
10.  If, after publication of an invitation to participate in any case of intended procurement, but before the time set for opening or receipt of tenders as specified in the notices or the tender documentation, it becomes necessary to amend or re-issue the notice, the amendment or the re-issued notice shall be given the same circulation as the original documents upon which the amendment is based. Any significant information given to one supplier with respect to a particular intended procurement shall be given simultaneously to all other suppliers concerned in adequate time to permit the suppliers to consider such information and to respond to it.   
11.  Entities shall make clear, in the notices referred to in this Article or in the publication in which the notices appear, that the procurement is covered by the Agreement.   

### Article  X  

####Selection Procedures

1.  To ensure optimum effective international competition under selective tendering procedures, entities shall, for each intended procurement, invite tenders from the maximum number of domestic suppliers and suppliers of other Parties, consistent with the efficient operation of the procurement system. They shall select the suppliers to participate in the procedure in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.   
2.  Entities maintaining permanent lists of qualified suppliers may select suppliers to be invited to tender from among those listed. Any selection shall allow for equitable opportunities for suppliers on the lists.   
3.  Suppliers requesting to participate in a particular intended procurement shall be permitted to submit a tender and be considered, provided, in the case of those not yet qualified, there is sufficient time to complete the qualification procedure under Articles VIII and IX. The number of additional suppliers permitted to participate shall be limited only by the efficient operation of the procurement system.   
4.  Requests to participate in selective tendering procedures may be submitted by telex, telegram or facsimile.   

### Article  XI  

####Time-limits for Tendering and Delivery

### *General* 

1. 
a) Any prescribed time-limit shall be adequate to allow suppliers of other Parties as well as domestic suppliers to prepare and submit tenders before the closing of the tendering procedures. In determining any such time-limit, entities shall, consistent with their own reasonable needs, take into account such factors as the complexity of the intended procurement, the extent of subcontracting anticipated and the normal time for transmitting tenders by mail from foreign as well as domestic points.  

b) Each Party shall ensure that its entities shall take due account of publication delays when setting the final date for receipt of tenders or of applications to be invited to tender.    
### *Deadlines* 

2.  Except in so far as provided in paragraph 3, 

a) in open procedures, the period for the receipt of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date of publication referred to in paragraph 1 of Article IX;  

b) in selective procedures not involving the use of a permanent list of qualified suppliers, the period for submitting an application to be invited to tender shall not be less than 25 days from the date of publication referred to in paragraph 1 of Article IX; the period for receipt of tenders shall in no case be less than 40 days from the date of issuance of the invitation to tender;  

c) in selective procedures involving the use of a permanent list of qualified suppliers, the period for receipt of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date of the initial issuance of invitations to tender, whether or not the date of initial issuance of invitations to tender coincides with the date of the publication referred to in paragraph 1 of Article IX.     
3.  The periods referred to in paragraph 2 may be reduced in the circumstances set out below: 

a) if a separate notice has been published 40 days and not more than 12 months in advance and the notice contains at least: 

i) as much of the information referred to in paragraph 6 of Article IX as is available;  

ii) the information referred to in paragraph 8 of Article IX;  

iii) a statement that interested suppliers should express their interest in the procurement to the entity; and  

iv) a contact point with the entity from which further information may be obtained, the 40-day limit for receipt of tenders may be replaced by a period sufficiently long to enable responsive tendering, which, as a general rule, shall not be less than 24 days, but in any case not less than 10 days;    

b) in the case of the second or subsequent publications dealing with contracts of a recurring nature within the meaning of paragraph 6 of Article IX, the 40-day limit for receipt of tenders may be reduced to not less than 24 days;  

c) where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the entity renders impracticable the periods in question, the periods specified in paragraph 2 may be reduced but shall in no case be less than 10 days from the date of the publication referred to in paragraph 1 of Article IX; or  

d) the period referred to in paragraph 2 c) may, for procurements by entities listed in Annexes 2 and 3, be fixed by mutual agreement between the entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence of agreement, the entity may fix periods which shall be sufficiently long to enable responsive tendering and shall in any case not be less than 10 days.     
4.  Consistent with the entity's own reasonable needs, any delivery date shall take into account such factors as the complexity of the intended procurement, the extent of subcontracting anticipated and the realistic time required for production, de-stocking and transport of goods from the points of supply or for supply of services.   

### Article  XII  

####Tender Documentation

1.  If, in tendering procedures, an entity allows tenders to be submitted in several languages, one of those languages shall be one of the official languages of the WTO.   
2.  Tender documentation provided to suppliers shall contain all information necessary to permit them to submit responsive tenders, including information required to be published in the notice of intended procurement, except for paragraph 6g) of Article IX, and the following:

i) the terms of payment;  

j) any other terms or conditions;  

k) in accordance with Article XVII the terms and conditions, if any, under which tenders from countries not Parties to this Agreement, but which apply the procedures of that Article, will be entertained.    
### *Forwarding of Tender Documentation by the Entities* 

3.  

a) In open procedures, entities shall forward the tender documentation at the request of any supplier participating in the procedure, and shall reply promptly to any reasonable request for explanations relating thereto.  

b) In selective procedures, entities shall forward the tender documentation at the request of any supplier requesting to participate, and shall reply promptly to any reasonable request for explanations relating thereto.  

c) Entities shall reply promptly to any reasonable request for relevant information submitted by a supplier participating in the tendering procedure, on condition that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over its competitors in the procedure for the award of the contract.     

### Article  XIII  

####Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts

1.  The submission, receipt and opening of tenders and awarding of contracts shall be consistent with the following: 

a) tenders shall normally be submitted in writing directly or by mail. If tenders by telex, telegram or facsimile are permitted, the tender made thereby must include all the information necessary for the evaluation of the tender, in particular the definitive price proposed by the tenderer and a statement that the tenderer agrees to all the terms, conditions and provisions of the invitation to tender. The tender must be confirmed promptly by letter or by the despatch of a signed copy of the telex, telegram or facsimile. Tenders presented by telephone shall not be permitted. The content of the telex, telegram or facsimile shall prevail where there is a difference or conflict between that content and any documentation received after the time-limit; and  

b) the opportunities that may be given to tenderers to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract shall not be permitted to give rise to any discriminatory practice.    
### *Receipt of Tenders* 

2.  A supplier shall not be penalized if a tender is received in the office designated in the tender documentation after the time specified because of delay due solely to mishandling on the part of the entity. Tenders may also be considered in other exceptional circumstances if the procedures of the entity concerned so provide.  
### *Opening of Tenders* 

3.  All tenders solicited under open or selective procedures by entities shall be received and opened under procedures and conditions guaranteeing the regularity of the openings. The receipt and opening of tenders shall also be consistent with the national treatment and nondiscrimination provisions of this Agreement. Information on the opening of tenders shall remain with the entity concerned at the disposal of the government authorities responsible for the entity in order that it may be used if required under the procedures of Articles XVIII, XIX, XX and XXII.  
### *Award of Contracts* 

4.  

a) To be considered for award, a tender must, at the time of opening, conform to the essential requirements of the notices or tender documentation and be from a supplier which complies with the conditions for participation. If an entity has received a tender abnormally lowed than other tenders submitted, it may enquire with the tenderer to ensure that it can comply with the conditions of participation and be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract.  

b) Unless in the public interest an entity decides not to issue the contract, the entity shall make the award to the tenderer who has been determined to be fully capable of undertaking the contract and whose tender, whether for domestic products or services, or products or services of other Parties, is either the lowest tender or the tender which in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or tender documentation is determined to be the most advantageous.  

c) Awards shall be made in accordance with the criteria and essential requirements specified in the tender documentation.    
### *Option Clauses*

1.  A Party may provide for entities to conduct negotiations: 

a) in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such intent, namely in the notice referred to in paragraph 2 of Article IX (the invitation to suppliers to participate in the procedure for the proposed procurement); or  

b) when it appears from evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation set forth in the notices or tender documentation.     
2.  Negotiations shall primarily be used to identify the strengths and weakness in tenders.   
3.  Entities shall treat tenders in confidence. In particular, they shall not provide information intented to assist particular participants to bring their tenders up to the level of other participants.

### Article  XV  

####Limited Tendering

1.  The provisions of Articles VII through XIV governing open and selective tendering procedures need not apply in the following conditions, provided that limited tendering is not used with a view to avoiding maximum possible competition or in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination among suppliers of other Parties or protection to domestic producers or suppliers: 

a) in the absence of tenders in response to an open or selective tender, or when the tenders submitted have been collusive, or not in conformity with the essential requirements in the tender, or from suppliers who do not comply with the conditions for participation provided for in accordance with this Agreement, on condition, however, that the requirements of the initial tender are not substantially modified in the contract as awarded;  

b) when, for works of art or for reasons connected with protection of exclusive rights, such as patents or copyrights, or in the absence of competition for technical reasons, the products or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists;  

c) in so far as is strictly necessary when, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the entity, the products or services could not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering procedures,  

d) for additional deliveries by the original supplier which are intended either as parts replacement for existing supplies, or installations, or as the extension of existing supplies, services, or installations where a change of supplier would compel the entity to procure equipment or services not meeting requirements of interchangeability with already existing equipment or services ; <sup> 1)  It is the understanding that "existing equipment" includes software to the extent that the initial procurement of the software was covered by the Agreement.  </sup>  

e) when an entity procures prototypes or a first product or service which are developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. When such contracts have been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of products or services shall be subject to Articles VII through XIV ; <sup> 2)  Original development of a first product or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the product or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards. It does not extend to quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs.  </sup>  

f) when additional construction services which were not included in the initial contract but which were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, through unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein, and the entity needs to award contracts for the additional construction services to the contractor carrying out the construction services concerned since the separation of the additional construction services from the initial contract would be difficult for technical or economic reasons and cause significant inconvenience to the entity. However, the total value of contracts awarded for the additional construction services may not exceed 50 per cent of the amount of the main contract;  

g) for new construction services consisting of the repetition of similar construction services which conform to a basic project for which an initial contract was awarded in accordance with Articles VII through XIV and for which the entity has indicated in the notice of intended procurement concerning the initial construction service, that limited tendering procedures might be used in awarding contracts for such new construction services,  

h) for products purchased on a commodity market;  

i) for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions which only arise in the very short term. This provision is intended to cover unusual disposals by firms which are not normally suppliers, or disposal of assets of businesses in liquidation or receivership. It is not intended to cover routine purchases from regular suppliers;  

j) in the case of contracts awarded to the winner of a design contest provided that the contest has been organized in a manner which is consistent with the principles of this Agreement, notably as regards the publication, in the sense of Article IX, of an invitation to suitably qualified suppliers, to participate in such a contest which shall be judged by an independent jury with a view to design contracts being awarded to the winners.     
2.  Entities shall prepare a report in writing on each contract awarded under the provisions of paragraph 1. Each report shall contain the name of the procuring entity, value and kind of goods or services procured, country of origin, and a statement of the conditions in this Article which prevailed. This report shall remain with the entities concerned at the disposal of the government authorities responsible for the entity in order that it may be used if required under the procedures of Articles XVIII, XIX, XX and XXII.   

### Article  XVI  

####Offsets

1.  Entities shall not, in the qualification and selection of suppliers, products or services, or in the evaluation of tenders and award of contracts, impose, seek or consider offsets. <sup> 1)  Offsets in government procurement are measures used to encourage local development or improve the balance-of-payments accounts by means of domestic content, licensing of technology, investment requirements, counter-trade or similar requirements.  </sup>   
2.  Nevertheless, having regard to general policy considerations, including those relating to development, a developing country may at the time of accession negotiate conditions for the use of offsets, such as requirements for the incorporation of domestic content. Such requirements shall be used only for qualification to participate in the procurement process and not as criteria for awarding contracts. Conditions shall be objective, clearly defined and non-discriminatory. They shall be set forth in the country's Appendix I and may include precise limitations on the imposition of offsets in any contract subject to this Agreement. The existence of such conditions shall be notified to the Committee and included in the notice of intended procurement and other documentation.   

### Article  XVII  

####Transparency

1.  Each Party shall encourage entities to indicate the terms and conditions, including any deviations from competitive tendering procedures or access to challenge procedures, under which tenders will be entertained from suppliers situated in countries not Parties to this Agreement but which, with a view to creating transparency in their own contract awards, nevertheless: 

a) specify their contracts in accordance with Article VI (technical specifications);  

b) publish the procurement notices referred to in Article IX, including, in the version of the notice referred to in paragraph 8 of Article IX (summary of the notice of intended procurement) which is published in an official language of the WTO, an indication of the terms and conditions under which tenders shall be entertained from suppliers situated in countries Parties to this Agreement;  

c) are willing to ensure that their procurement regulations shall not normally change during a procurement and, in the event that such change proves unavoidable, to ensure the availability of a satisfactory means of redress.     
2.  Governments not Parties to the Agreement which comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs 1a) through 1c), shall be entitled if they so inform the Parties to participate in the Committee as observers.

Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op iedere wet, verordening, procedure en praktijk betreffende welke opdracht ook die wordt geplaatst door de in deze Overeenkomst bedoelde instanties, zoals vermeld in Aanhangsel I . <sup> 1)  Voor elke Partij wordt Aanhangsel I verdeeld in vijf Bijlagen:   – Bijlage 1: instanties van de centrale overheid;   – Bijlage 2: instanties van lagere overheden;   – Bijlage 3: alle andere instanties die hun opdrachten plaatsen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst;   – Bijlage 4: de vormen van dienstverlening die wél (of juist niet) onder de Overeenkomst vallen;   – Bijlage 5: de aannemingsopdrachten die onder de Overeenkomst vallen.   De toepasselijke drempels worden in de Bijlagen voor elke Partij opgegeven.  </sup>   
2.  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op elke opdracht, met welke contractuele middelen ook, met inbegrip van koop, leasing, huur of huurkoop, met of zonder koopoptie, betreffende elke combinatie van produkten en diensten.   
3.  Indien instanties in het kader van deze Overeenkomst van ondernemingen die niet in Aanhangsel I zijn genoemd verlangen dat zij opdrachten plaatsen met inachtneming van bijzondere voorschriften, dan is artikel III *mutatis mutandis* van toepassing op die voorschriften.   
4.  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op iedere opdracht met een waarde die tenminste gelijk is aan de in Aanhangsel I genoemde relevante drempel.   

### Artikel  II  

####Berekening van de waarde van opdrachten

1.  Voor het bepalen van de waarde van opdrachten met het oog op de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst gelden de hierna volgende regels. <sup> 2)  Deze Overeenkomst is van toepassing op elke overheidsopdracht waarvan de waarde minstens gelijk is aan de drempel die geldt op het ogenblik van de publikatie van het bericht als bedoeld in artikel IX.  </sup>   
2.  Bij de waardebepaling moet rekening worden gehouden met alle vormen van vergoeding, met inbegrip van alle premies, provisies, commissielonen en te ontvangen rente.   
3.  De keuze van de berekeningsmethode mag door de instantie niet worden gebruikt, en een opdracht mag niet worden gesplitst om zich aan de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst te onttrekken.   
4.  Indien een bepaald vereiste met betrekking tot een opdracht aanleiding geeft tot het plaatsen van meer dan één opdracht of tot het plaatsen van de opdracht in afzonderlijke percelen, moet de berekening gebaseerd zijn op ofwel 

a. de reële waarde van soortgelijke herhalingsopdrachten in het voorafgaande boekjaar of de voorafgaande periode van 12 maanden, indien mogelijk gecorrigeerd op grond van verwachte wijzigingen in hoeveelheid of waarde gedurende de volgende 12 maanden; ofwel  

b. de geraamde waarde van herhalingsopdrachten in het boekjaar of de periode van 12 maanden volgende op de eerste opdracht.     
5.  In het geval van opdrachten inzake leasing, huur of huurkoop van produkten of diensten of in het geval van opdrachten waarvan de totale prijs niet vaststaat, wordt de geraamde waarde van de opdracht berekend op de volgende grondslag: 

a. bij opdrachten met een vaste looptijd, de totale waarde voor de gehele looptijd wanneer die ten hoogste 12 maanden bedraagt, dan wel de totale waarde met inbegrip van de geraamde restwaarde wanneer de looptijd meer dan 12 maanden bedraagt;  

b. bij opdrachten voor onbepaalde duur, het maandelijks te betalen bedrag vermenigvuldigd met 48.   Bij twijfel wordt de tweede berekeningsmethode, d.w.z. die onder b., toegepast.   
6.  Indien in de stukken betreffende een voorgenomen aanbesteding de noodzaak van optiebedingen is vermeld, dient voor de berekening van de geraamde waarde de totale waarde van de maximaal toegestane aanschaffing, inclusief optiebedingen, als grondslag te worden genomen.   

### Artikel  III  

####Eigen-onderdaanbehandeling en non-discriminatie

1.  Ten aanzien van alle wetten, verordeningen, procedures en praktijken op het gebied van de in deze Overeenkomst bedoelde overheidsopdrachten, verlenen de Partijen aan de produkten, diensten en leveranciers van andere Partijen die produkten of diensten van de Partijen aanbieden een behandeling die niet minder gunstig is dan de behandeling voor: 

a. binnenlandse produkten, diensten en leveranciers;  

b. produkten, diensten en leveranciers van een andere Partij.     
2.  Ten aanzien van alle wetten, verordeningen, procedures en praktijken op het gebied van de in deze Overeenkomst bedoelde overheidsopdrachten, zien de Partijen erop toe: 

a. dat hun instanties een ter plaatse gevestigde leverancier niet minder gunstig behandelen dan een andere ter plaatse gevestigde leverancier op grond van de mate waarin het kapitaal ervan of de zeggenschap erover in buitenlandse handen is;  

b. dat hun instanties niet discriminerend optreden tegen ter plaatse gevestigde leveranciers op grond van het land van herkomst van de geleverde goederen of diensten, voor zover het land van herkomst overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel IV Partij is bij de Overeenkomst.     
3.  De bepalingen van de leden 1 en 2 zijn niet van toepassing op de douanerechten en heffingen van ongeacht welke aard die bij invoer of bij gelegenheid van de invoer worden geïnd, noch op de wijze van inning van die rechten en heffingen, noch op de andere invoerregelingen en -formaliteiten, noch op maatregelen betreffende de handel in diensten, met uitzondering van de wetten, verordeningen, procedures en praktijken inzake overheidsopdrachten, die onder deze Overeenkomst vallen.   

### Artikel  IV  

####Regels van oorsprong

1.  De Partijen passen op produkten of diensten van herkomst uit andere landen die Partij zijn, welke worden ingevoerd c.q. verleend ten behoeve van onder deze Overeenkomst vallende overheidsopdrachten, geen regels van oorsprong toe die afwijken van de regels van oorsprong die op het ogenblik van de invoer in het normale handelsverkeer worden toegepast op de invoer c.q. verlening van dezelfde produkten of diensten uit dezelfde landen.   
2.  Na afsluiting van het werkprogramma met het oog op de harmonisatie van de regels van oorsprong voor goederen, dat moet worden opgezet uit hoofde van de Overeenkomst betreffende de oorsprongsregels in Bijlage 1A bij de Overeenkomst tot oprichting van de Wereldhandelsorganisatie („Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization”, hierna „WTO-Overeenkomst” genoemd), en de onderhandelingen over de handel in diensten, moeten de Partijen aan de hand van de resultaten van dat werkprogramma en van die onderhandelingen het eerste lid indien nodig aanpassen.   

### Artikel  V  

####Bijzondere en aan de omstandigheden aangepaste behandeling van de ontwikkelingslanden

### *Doelstellingen* 

1.  Bij de uitvoering en het beheer van deze Overeenkomst houden de Partijen, door toepassing van de bepalingen van dit artikel, naar behoren rekening met de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden, in het bijzonder van de minstontwikkelde landen, op het gebied van ontwikkeling, financiën en handel, met inachtneming van de noodzaak: 

a. hun betalingsbalanspositie te beschermen en te zorgen voor voldoende reserves voor de uitvoering van economische ontwikkelingsprogramma's;  

b. de oprichting of ontwikkeling van eigen nationale industriebedrijven te bevorderen, met inbegrip van de ontwikkeling van kleinschalige en ambachtelijke industrieën in plattelands- of achtergebleven gebieden, alsmede de economische ontwikkeling van andere sectoren van de economie;  

c. industriebedrijven te ondersteunen zolang deze geheel of in wezenlijke mate afhankelijk zijn van overheidsopdrachten;  

d. hun economische ontwikkeling aan te moedigen door middel van regionale of mondiale regelingen tussen ontwikkelingslanden welke zijn voorgelegd aan de Ministeriële Conferentie van de Wereldhandelsorganisatie („World Trade Organization”, hierna „WTO” genoemd) en door deze niet zijn afgekeurd.     
2.  Overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst vergemakkelijkt elk van de Partijen bij de uitwerking en toepassing van wetten, verordeningen of procedures inzake overheidsopdrachten de toeneming van de invoer uit de ontwikkelingslanden, waarbij zij rekening houdt met de bijzondere problemen van de minstontwikkelde landen en de landen waarin de economische ontwikkeling in het beginstadium verkeert.  
### *Werkingssfeer* 

3.  Ten einde te waarborgen dat de ontwikkelingslanden tot deze Overeenkomst kunnen toetreden op voorwaarden die in overeenstemming zijn met hun behoeften op het gebied van ontwikkeling, financiën en handel, wordt bij de onderhandelingen betreffende de opdrachten van de ontwikkelingslanden waarop de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn, naar behoren rekening gehouden met de in lid 1 genoemde doelstellingen. Wanneer de ontwikkelde landen op grond van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst hun lijsten opstellen van alles wat binnen de werkingssfeer ervan valt, trachten zij op die lijsten instanties te plaatsen die produkten en diensten aanschaffen waarvan de uitvoer voor de ontwikkelingslanden van belang is.  
### *Overeengekomen uitzonderingen* 

4.  Een ontwikkelingsland kan met de andere deelnemers in onderhandelingen die op grond van deze Overeenkomst worden gevoerd, wederzijds aanvaardbare uitzonderingen op de regels inzake eigen-onderdaanbehandeling vaststellen met betrekking tot bepaalde instanties of bepaalde produkten of diensten die op zijn lijsten zijn opgenomen, zulks op grond van de bijzondere omstandigheden van elk geval. Tijdens die onderhandelingen wordt naar behoren rekening gehouden met de in lid 1, onder a. tot en met c., weergegeven overwegingen. Een ontwikkelingsland dat deelneemt aan de in lid 1, onder d., bedoelde regionale of mondiale regelingen kan eveneens uitzonderingen op zijn lijsten bedingen op grond van de bijzondere omstandigheden van elk geval, onder andere met inachtneming van de bepalingen inzake overheidsopdrachten welke zijn opgenomen in de betrokken regionale of mondiale regelingen, en inzonderheid rekening houdend met de produkten of diensten die onder gemeenschappelijke industriële ontwikkelingsprogramma's vallen.   
5.  Na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst kan een ontwikkelingsland dat daarbij Partij is zijn lijsten wijzigen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel XXIV, lid 6, betreffende de wijziging van deze lijsten, zulks op grond van hun behoeften op het gebied van ontwikkeling, financiën en handel; dan wel kunnen zij het Comité voor overheidsopdrachten (hierna te noemen „het Comité”) verzoeken uitzonderingen op de regels inzake eigen-onderdaanbehandeling toe te staan met betrekking tot bepaalde instanties of bepaalde produkten of diensten die op hun lijsten zijn opgenomen, zulks op grond van de bijzondere omstandigheden van elk geval en naar behoren rekening houdend met de bepalingen van lid 1, onder a. tot en met c.. Na de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst kan een ontwikkelingsland dat daarbij Partij is het Comité eveneens verzoeken uitzonderingen toe te staan voor wat betreft bepaalde instanties of bepaalde produkten of diensten die op hun lijsten zijn opgenomen, zulks wegens zijn deelneming aan regionale of mondiale regelingen tussen ontwikkelingslanden, op basis van de bijzondere omstandigheden van elk geval en naar behoren rekening houdend met de bepalingen van lid 1, onder d.. Ieder verzoek dat een ontwikkelingsland dat Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst met betrekking tot de wijziging van een lijst tot het Comité richt, gaat vergezeld van documentatie ter zake en van alle inlichtingen die voor de behandeling ervan noodzakelijk kunnen zijn.   
6.  De bepalingen van de leden 4 en 5 zijnmutatis mutandis van toepassing op de ontwikkelingslanden die tot de Overeenkomst toetreden na de inwerkingtreding ervan. *mutatis mutandis* van toepassing op de ontwikkelingslanden die tot de Overeenkomst toetreden na de inwerkingtreding ervan.   
7.  De in de leden 4, 5 en 6 bedoelde overeengekomen uitzonderingen worden onderzocht overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 14.  
### *Technische bijstand aan ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst* 

8.  Elk ontwikkeld land dat Partij is bij de Overeenkomst verleent op verzoek aan de ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst alle technische bijstand die het passend acht, ten einde voor de problemen van die landen op het gebied van overheidsopdrachten een oplossing te vinden.   
9.  Deze bijstand, die wordt verleend op basis van non-discriminatie tussen de ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, heeft onder andere betrekking op: 

– de oplossing van bijzondere technische problemen met betrekking tot het plaatsen van een bepaalde opdracht;  

– alle andere problemen die de Partij die hierom verzoekt en een andere Partij overeenkomen in het kader van deze bijstand te behandelen.     
10.  De in de leden 8 en 9 bedoelde technische bijstand bestaat onder meer in de vertaling van erkenningsstukken en offertes van leveranciers uit ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst, in een door de instantie opgegeven officiële taal van de WTO, tenzij het ontwikkelde land dat Partij is bij de Overeenkomst de vertaling bezwarend vindt, in welk geval aan de betrokken ontwikkelingslanden op hun verzoek uitleg wordt gegeven, gericht aan ofwel de landen zelf, ofwel hun instanties.  
### *Informatiecentra* 

11.  De ontwikkelde landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst richten individueel of gemeenschappelijk informatiecentra op voor de beantwoording van redelijke verzoeken om informatie van ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst met betrekking tot, onder andere, wetten, verordeningen, procedures en praktijken betreffende overheidsopdrachten, gepubliceerde aankondigingen van voorgenomen aanbestedingen, adressen van de onder deze Overeenkomst vallende instanties, en de aard en de hoeveelheid van aangeschafte of aan te schaffen produkten of diensten, met inbegrip van beschikbare informatie over toekomstige aanbestedingen. Het Comité kan eveneens een informatiecentrum oprichten.  
### *Bijzondere behandeling van de minstontwikkelde landen* 

12.  Gezien punt 6 van het Besluit van 28 november 1979 inzake gedifferentieerde en gunstiger behandeling, wederkerigheid en ruimere participatie van de ontwikkelingslanden, genomen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen bij de GATT-Overeenkomst van 1947 (BISD 26S/203-205) wordt een bijzondere behandeling toegekend aan de minstontwikkelde landen die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst en aan de leveranciers van deze landen ten aanzien van produkten of diensten van oorsprong uit deze landen, in het kader van alle algemene of bijzondere maatregelen ten behoeve van de ontwikkelingslanden die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst. Een Partij kan de Overeenkomst eveneens laten gelden voor leveranciers in minstontwikkelde landen die geen Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst voor wat betreft produkten of diensten van oorsprong uit die landen.   
13.  Elk ontwikkeld land dat Partij is bij de Overeenkomst verleent op verzoek aan potentiële inschrijvers in de minstontwikkelde landen de bijstand die het passend acht bij de indiening van hun offertes en bij de keuze van de produkten of diensten welke voor de instanties van het ontwikkelde land alsook voor de leveranciers in de minstontwikkelde landen van belang kunnen zijn en verleent deze eveneens bijstand bij het nakomen van de technische voorschriften en normen met betrekking tot de produkten of diensten waarop de voorgenomen aanbesteding betrekking heeft.  
### *Toetsing* 

14.  Het Comité toetst ieder jaar de toepassing en de doeltreffendheid van dit artikel en voert om de drie jaar op basis van door de Partijen in te dienen verslagen een grondige toetsing uit van de werking ervan, ten einde de resultaten te evalueren. In het kader van de driejaarlijkse evaluaties en ten einde een zo ruim mogelijke tenuitvoerlegging van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst te bereiken, met name met inbegrip van artikel III, en rekening houdend met de situatie van de betrokken ontwikkelingslanden op het gebied van ontwikkeling, financiën en handel, gaat het Comité na of de uitzonderingen die in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de leden 4 tot en met 6 van dit artikel zijn verleend moeten worden gewijzigd of verlengd.   
15.  In de loop van de verdere onderhandelingsronden in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel XXIV, lid 7, overweegt elk ontwikkelingsland dat Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst de mogelijkheid zijn lijsten uit te breiden op basis van zijn economische, financiële en handelssituatie.   

### Artikel  VI  

####Technische specificaties

1.  Technische specificaties waarin de kenmerken van de aan te schaffen produkten of diensten worden omschreven, zoals kwaliteit, prestatie, veiligheid en afmetingen, proefneming en proefnemingsmethodes, symbolen, terminologie, verpakking, merking en etikettering, dan wel de procédés of methoden voor de produktie ervan en de door aanbestedende instanties voorgeschreven vereisten inzake de procedures voor beoordeling van de conformiteit, mogen niet worden opgesteld, vastgesteld of toegepast met als doel of gevolg dat nodeloze belemmeringen voor de internationale handel ontstaan.   
2.  De door aanbestedende instanties voorgeschreven technische specificaties zijn in voorkomend geval: 

a. opgesteld in termen van de te leveren prestaties en niet van de vormgeving of van een beschrijving van de kenmerken;  

b. gebaseerd op internationale normen, indien die bestaan, en anders op nationale technische voorschriften , erkende nationale normen of bouwvoorschriften. <sup> 1)  In de zin van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder een „technisch voorschrift” verstaan een bescheid waarin de kenmerken van een produkt of dienst of de daarbij behorende procédés en produktiemethoden zijn beschreven, met inbegrip van de toepasselijke administratieve bepalingen waarvan de inachtneming verplicht is. Het kan tevens geheel of gedeeltelijk betrekking hebben op de voorschriften inzake terminologie, symbolen, verpakking, merking of etikettering die van toepassing zijn op een produkt, dienst, procédé of produktiemethode.  </sup> <sup> 2)  In de zin van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder een „norm” verstaan een bescheid dat door een erkende instantie is goedgekeurd en waarin voor algemeen en herhaald gebruik regels, richtsnoeren of kenmerken voor produkten of diensten of voor de daarbij behorende procédés en produktiemethoden zijn beschreven waarvan de inachtneming niet verplicht is. Het kan tevens geheel of gedeeltelijk betrekking hebben op de voorschriften inzake terminologie, symbolen, verpakking, merking of etikettering die van toepassing zijn op een produkt, dienst, procédé of produktiemethode.  </sup>     
3.  Vereisten inzake of verwijzingen naar handelsmerken of -namen, octrooien, ontwerpen of typen, of naar een bepaalde oorsprong, producent of leverancier zijn niet toegestaan behalve wanneer er geen voldoende nauwkeurige of begrijpelijke manier is om de voorwaarden van de opdracht te beschrijven en op voorwaarde dat woorden zoals „of daarmee overeenstemmend” in de aanbestedingsstukken zijn opgenomen.   
4.  De instanties onthouden zich ervan om bij het opstellen van specificaties voor een bepaalde opdracht, op een manier die de mededinging zou uitschakelen, advies te vragen of te aanvaarden van een onderneming die een commercieel belang zou kunnen hebben bij de betrokken opdracht.   

### Artikel  VII  

####Aanbestedingsprocedures

1.  Elke Partij ziet erop toe dat de aanbestedingsprocedures van haar instanties op niet-discriminerende wijze worden toegepast en in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van de artikelen VII tot en met XVI.   
2.  De instanties verstrekken aan geen enkele leverancier inlichtingen met betrekking tot een bepaalde opdracht, welke zouden kunnen leiden tot een uitschakeling van de mededinging.   
3.  In de zin van deze Overeenkomst wordt verstaan onder: 

a. openbare aanbestedingsprocedures: die procedures waarbij alle belangstellende leveranciers een offerte kunnen indienen;  

b. aanbestedingsprocedures met voorafgaande selectie: die procedures waarbij, in overeenstemming met artikel X, lid 3, en de andere desbetreffende bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, de daartoe door de instantie uitgenodigde leveranciers een offerte kunnen indienen;  

c. onderhandse aanbestedingsprocedures: die procedures waarbij de instantie zich individueel tot leveranciers richt, uitsluitend met inachtneming van de in artikel XV aangegeven voorwaarden.     

### Artikel  VIII  

####Erkenning van leveranciers

De instanties mogen bij de erkenning van leveranciers geen onderscheid maken tussen leveranciers uit verschillende landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst, of tussen binnenlandse leveranciers en leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn. De erkenningsprocedures moeten in overeenstemming zijn met de volgende bepalingen: 

a. de voorwaarden voor deelneming aan aanbestedingsprocedures worden tijdig bekendgemaakt, zodat de belangstellende leveranciers in staat zijn de erkenningsprocedures aan te vangen en, voor zover zulks verenigbaar is met de doeltreffende werking van het mechanisme voor het plaatsen van opdrachten, te beëindigen;  

b. de enige voorwaarden voor deelneming aan aanbestedingsprocedures zijn die welke van wezenlijk belang zijn om te garanderen dat de onderneming de nodige bekwaamheid heeft om de betrokken opdracht tot een goed einde te brengen. De aan leveranciers gestelde voorwaarden voor deelneming, met inbegrip van financiële waarborgen, technische kwalificaties en gegevens die nodig zijn voor de vaststelling van de financiële draagkracht, alsmede het commerciële en technische vermogen, alsook de verificatie van de kwalificaties, zijn voor leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst niet minder gunstig dan voor binnenlandse leveranciers en maken geen onderscheid tussen leveranciers uit landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst. De financiële draagkracht, alsmede het commerciële en technische vermogen van een leverancier worden beoordeeld aan de hand van de totale commerciële bedrijvigheid van de leverancier enerzijds en van diens bedrijvigheid op het grondgebied van de aanbestedende instantie anderzijds, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met de juridische bindingen tussen de verkooporganisaties;  

c. de procedure voor de erkenning van leveranciers en de daarvoor benodigde tijd mogen niet worden gebruikt om leveranciers uit landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst van een leverancierslijst af te voeren of om te verhinderen dat zij voor een bepaalde voorgenomen aanbesteding in aanmerking komen. De instanties erkennen als erkende leveranciers die binnenlandse leveranciers of leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst die voldoen aan de voorwaarden voor deelneming aan een bepaalde voorgenomen aanbesteding. Eventueel nog niet erkende leveranciers die verzoeken om deelneming aan een bepaalde voorgenomen aanbesteding worden eveneens in aanmerking genomen, mits er voldoende tijd is om de erkenningsprocedure te beëindigen;  

d. de instanties met permanente lijsten van erkende leveranciers zien erop toe dat leveranciers te allen tijde een aanvraag tot erkenning kunnen indienen en dat alle erkende leveranciers die erom verzoeken binnen een redelijk korte tijd op de lijsten worden opgenomen;  

e. indien na bekendmaking van het in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde bericht een nog niet erkend leverancier erom verzoekt aan een voorgenomen aanbesteding te mogen deelnemen, leidt de instantie onverwijld de erkenningsprocedures in;  

f. iedere leverancier die heeft aangevraagd om erkend leverancier te worden, wordt door de betrokken instanties in kennis gesteld van het desbetreffende besluit. Erkende leveranciers die door instanties op permanente lijsten zijn opgenomen worden eveneens in kennis gesteld van de beëindiging van dergelijke lijsten of van het feit dat zij van die lijsten zijn afgevoerd;  

g. elke Partij ziet erop toe dat: 

i. elke instantie en haar onderafdelingen één enkele erkenningsprocedure toepassen, behalve wanneer het gebruik van een andere procedure naar behoren kan worden gemotiveerd;  

ii. alles in het werk wordt gesteld om de verschillen tussen de erkenningsprocedures van verschillende instanties zo klein mogelijk te houden.     

h. het bepaalde onder a. tot en met g. verhindert niet dat een leverancier om redenen als faillissement of valse verklaringen kan worden uitgesloten, mits deze maatregel in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst inzake nationale behandeling en non-discriminatie.    

### Artikel  IX  

####Uitnodiging tot deelneming aan een voorgenomen aanbesteding

1.  In overeenstemming met de leden 2 en 3 publiceren de instanties een uitnodiging tot deelneming voor iedere voorgenomen aanbesteding, behalve indien anders bepaald in artikel XV (onderhandse aanbesteding). Dit bericht wordt bekendgemaakt in de passende publikatie uit de lijst in Aanhangsel II.   
2.  De uitnodiging tot deelneming kan de vorm aannemen van een bericht van aanbesteding als bedoeld in lid 6.   
3.  De in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 genoemde instanties kunnen voor een uitnodiging tot deelneming gebruik maken van een aankondiging van geplande aanbestedingen als bedoeld in lid 7, of van een mededeling betreffende een erkenningssysteem als bedoeld in lid 9.   
4.  Instanties die voor een uitnodiging tot deelneming gebruik maken van een aankondiging van een geplande aanbesteding, nodigen later alle leveranciers die van hun belangstelling hebben doen blijken uit, hun belangstelling te bevestigen aan de hand van informatie die ten minste de in lid 6 genoemde gegevens omvat.   
5.  Instanties die voor een uitnodiging tot deelneming gebruik maken van een mededeling betreffende een erkenningssysteem, verstrekken, met inachtneming van de in artikel XVIII, lid 4, genoemde factoren en tijdig, informatie die al degenen die van hun belangstelling hebben doen blijken ruimschoots in de gelegenheid stelt nader te beoordelen in hoeverre zij belangstelling hebben voor deelneming aan de aanbesteding. Deze informatie omvat de gegevens die in de in de leden 6 en 8 bedoelde aankondigingen vervat zijn, voor zover die beschikbaar zijn-.Gegevens die aan de ene belangstellende leverancier worden verstrekt, worden op niet-discriminerende wijze aan alle andere belangstellende leveranciers doorgegeven.   
6.  Ieder bericht van aanbesteding als bedoeld in lid 2 bevat de volgende gegevens: 

a. de aard en de hoeveelheid, met inbegrip van eventuele opties voor latere opdrachten en, indien mogelijk, een raming van de termijn waarbinnen die opties mogelijk zullen worden gelicht; in het geval van herhalingsopdrachten, de aard en de hoeveelheid en, indien mogelijk, een raming van de termijn waarbinnen de latere berichten van aanbesteding voor de aan te schaffen produkten of diensten te verwachten zijn;  

b. de wijze waarop de procedure verloopt: openbaar of na voorafgaande selectie, dan wel via onderhandelingen;  

c. in voorkomend geval, de begin- of einddatum van de levering van de goederen of diensten;  

d. het adres en de uiterste datum voor de indiening van aanvragen om te worden uitgenodigd tot inschrijving of te worden opgenomen op de lijst van erkende leveranciers, of voor de indiening van offertes, alsmede de taal of talen waarin deze moeten worden gesteld;  

e. het adres van de instantie die de opdracht plaatst en de nodige informatie voor het verkrijgen van specificaties en andere documenten verstrekt;  

f. alle economische en technische vereisten, financiële waarborgen en inlichtingen welke van de leveranciers worden verlangd;  

g. het voor de aanbestedingsstukken te storten bedrag en de wijze van betaling daarvan;  

h. de contractvorm van de opdracht waarvoor offertes worden ingewacht: aankoop, leasing, huur of huurkoop, of meer dan een van deze vormen.     
7.  Iedere aankondiging van een geplande aanbesteding als bedoeld in lid 3 bevat van de in lid 6 genoemde inlichtingen zoveel als beschikbaar is. In ieder geval bevat zij de in lid 8 bedoelde alsmede de volgende gegevens: 

a. een verklaring dat de belangstellende leveranciers hun belangstelling voor de opdracht aan de instantie kenbaar moeten maken;  

b. een contactpunt met de instantie waar nadere inlichtingen kunnen worden ingewonnen.     
8.  Voor iedere voorgenomen aanbesteding maakt de instantie in een van de officiële talen van de WTO een samenvatting bekend, waarin ten minste de volgende gegevens worden vermeld: 

a. de inhoud van de opdracht;  

b. de termijnen voor de indiening van offertes of van een aanvraag om te worden uitgenodigd tot inschrijving;  

c. adressen waar kan worden verzocht om de stukken met betrekking tot de opdracht.     
9.  Bij aanbestedingsprocedures met voorafgaande selectie publiceren de instanties die permanente lijsten van erkende leveranciers aanleggen jaarlijks in een van de in Aanhangsel III genoemde publikaties een mededeling, die de volgende gegevens bevat: 

a. een opsomming van de bestaande lijsten, met inbegrip van hun titels, met betrekking tot de produkten of diensten c.q. categorieën produkten of diensten die via deze lijsten zullen worden aangeschaft;  

b. de voorwaarden waaraan de leveranciers moeten voldoen met het oog op hun opneming op deze lijsten en de wijzen waarop dit voor elk van deze voorwaarden door de betrokken instantie wordt getoetst;  

c. de geldigheidsduur van de lijsten en de formaliteiten voor de verlenging ervan. Indien een dergelijke mededeling overeenkomstig lid 3 wordt gebruikt voor een uitnodiging tot deelneming, bevat de mededeling daarenboven de volgende gegevens:  

d. de aard van de betrokken produkten of diensten;  

e. de vermelding dat de mededeling geldt als uitnodiging tot deelneming.   Indien de geldigheidsduur van het erkenningssysteem drie jaar of korter is, en voor zover die duur in de mededeling kenbaar is gemaakt en tevens duidelijk is gemaakt dat geen nieuwe mededelingen zullen worden gepubliceerd, kan ermee worden volstaan de mededeling eenmaal, bij het ingaan van de regeling, te publiceren. Een dergelijk systeem mag niet op zodanige wijze worden gebruikt dat de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst ermee worden omzeild.   
10.  Indien het, bij welke voorgenomen aanbesteding ook, na bekendmaking van een uitnodiging tot deelneming, doch vóór het tijdstip dat in de aankondigingen of de aanbestedingsstukken is vastgesteld voor de opening of de ontvangst van de offertes, noodzakelijk wordt de aankondiging te wijzigen of opnieuw te publiceren, wordt aan de wijziging of de opnieuw gepubliceerde aankondiging dezelfde verspreiding gegeven als aan de originele stukken waarop de wijziging betrekking heeft. Alle inlichtingen van betekenis die aan een leverancier worden verstrekt met betrekking tot een bepaalde voorgenomen aanbesteding worden gelijktijdig aan alle andere betrokken leveranciers medegedeeld op een zodanig tijdstip dat zij daarmee rekening kunnen houden en dienovereenkomstig kunnen handelen.   
11.  In de in dit artikel bedoelde aankondigingen of in de publikatie waarin de aankondigingen verschijnen, vermelden de instanties dat de opdracht onder de toepassing van de Overeenkomst valt.   

### Artikel  X  

####Selectieprocedures

1.  Ten einde bij aanbestedingsprocedures met voorafgaande selectie een zo effectief mogelijke internationale mededinging te waarborgen, richten de instanties bij elke voorgenomen aanbesteding een uitnodiging tot inschrijving aan het grootst mogelijke aantal nationale leveranciers en leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst, dat verenigbaar is met een efficiënte werking van het mechanisme voor het plaatsen van opdrachten. Zij kiezen op eerlijke en niet-discriminerende wijze de leveranciers die aan de procedure mogen deelnemen.   
2.  Instanties die permanente lijsten van erkende leveranciers aanleggen, kunnen uit de op de lijst opgenomen leveranciers, de leveranciers kiezen die worden uitgenodigd tot inschrijving. Bij elke keuze krijgen de leveranciers op de lijsten gelijke kansen.   
3.  Leveranciers die verzoeken om deelneming aan een bepaalde voorgenomen aanbesteding mogen een offerte indienen en in aanmerking worden genomen, mits in het geval van nog niet erkende leveranciers voldoende tijd beschikbaar is om de in de artikelen VIII en IX bedoelde erkenningsprocedures te beëindigen. Het aantal aanvullende leveranciers die mogen deelnemen wordt slechts beperkt indien zulks noodzakelijk is om de doeltreffende werking van het mechanisme voor het plaatsen van opdrachten veilig te stellen.   
4.  Aanvragen tot deelneming aan aanbestedingsprocedures met voorafgaande selectie kunnen per telex, telegram of fax worden ingediend.   

### Artikel  XI  

####Termijnen voor het indienen van offertes en stukken

### *Algemeen* 

1.  

a. Alle voorgeschreven termijnen zijn toereikend om zowel leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst als binnenlandse leveranciers in staat te stellen hun offertes voor te bereiden en in te dienen vóór het sluiten van de aanbestedingsprocedures. Bij de vaststelling van dergelijke termijnen houden de instanties overeenkomstig hun eigen redelijke behoeften rekening met factoren zoals de complexiteit van de voorgenomen opdracht, de omvang van de verwachte onderaanneming en de normale verzendingsduur van offertes per post uit het buitenland en in het eigen land.  

b. Elke Partij ziet erop toe dat haar instanties bij het vaststellen van de termijn waarbinnen offertes of aanvragen om tot inschrijving te worden uitgenodigd worden ingewacht, naar behoren rekening houden met de tijd die nodig is voor de publikatie.    
### *Termijnen* 

2.  Behoudens het bepaalde in lid 3 gelden de volgende regels: 

a. bij openbare procedures bedraagt de termijn voor de ontvangst van de offertes niet minder dan 40 dagen te rekenen vanaf de in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde datum van bekendmaking;  

b. bij procedures met voorafgaande selectie waarbij geen gebruik wordt gemaakt van een permanente lijst van erkende leveranciers, bedraagt de periode voor indiening van een aanvraag om te worden uitgenodigd tot inschrijving niet minder dan 25 dagen te rekenen vanaf de in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde datum van bekendmaking; de termijn waarbinnen de offertes worden ingewacht, bedraagt in geen geval minder dan 40 dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop de uitnodiging is verzonden;  

c. bij procedures met voorafgaande selectie waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van een permanente lijst van erkende leveranciers, bedraagt de termijn waarbinnen de offertes worden ingewacht niet minder dan 40 dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum van de oorspronkelijke uitnodiging tot inschrijving, ongeacht of de datum van de oorspronkelijke uitnodiging tot inschrijving samenvalt met de in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde datum van bekendmaking.     
3.  De in lid 2 bedoelde termijnen mogen in de volgende gevallen worden bekort:   
4.  

a. indien ten minste 40 dagen en niet meer dan 12 maanden vooraf een afzonderlijke aankondiging is gepubliceerd, die op zijn minst de volgende gegevens bevat: 

i. zoveel van de in artikel IX, lid 6, genoemde gegevens als beschikbaar zijn;  

ii. de in artikel IX, lid 8, genoemde gegevens;  

iii. de vermelding dat belangstellende leveranciers aan de instantie hun belangstelling voor de opdracht kenbaar moeten maken;  

iv. een contactpunt met de instantie waar nadere inlichtingen kunnen worden verkregen,   kan de termijn van 40 dagen voor het indienen van offertes worden vervangen door een termijn die lang genoeg is om offertes die aan de gestelde voorwaarden voldoen mogelijk te maken, welke termijn in de regel niet minder dan 24 dagen en in geen geval minder dan 10 dagen mag bedragen;  

b. in het geval van een tweede of volgende bekendmaking inzake herhalingsopdrachten in de zin van artikel IX, lid 6, kan de termijn van 40 dagen waarbinnen de offertes worden ingewacht worden verkort tot niet minder dan 24 dagen;  

c. wanneer een door de instantie naar behoren bewezen dringende situatie de naleving van de betrokken termijnen onmogelijk maakt, kunnen de in lid 2 genoemde termijnen worden bekort, maar deze bedragen in geen geval minder dan 10 dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum van de in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde publikatie.  

d. de in lid 2, onder c., bedoelde termijn kan bij opdrachten die worden geplaatst door een instantie die in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 is opgenomen, in onderling overleg worden vastgesteld door de instantie en de uitgekozen leveranciers. Bij gebreke van overeenstemming kan de instantie een termijn vaststellen die lang genoeg is om offertes die aan de gestelde voorwaarden voldoen mogelijk te maken, maar die in geen geval minder dan 10 dagen mag bedragen.     
4.  Overeenkomstig de eigen redelijke behoeften van de instantie wordt bij de leveringstermijnen rekening gehouden met de complexiteit van de voorgenomen opdracht, de omvang van de verwachte onderaanneming en de tijd die realistisch gesproken nodig is voor de produktie, het uit voorraad halen en het vervoer van goederen uit de plaatsen van levering of voor het verrichten van de diensten.   

### Artikel  XII  

####Aanbestedingsstukken

1.  Indien een instantie bij aanbestedingsprocedures de indiening van offertes in verschillende talen toestaat, moet een van deze talen een van de officiële talen van de WTO zijn.   
2.  In de aan de leveranciers verstrekte aanbestedingsstukken worden alle gegevens vermeld waardoor deze in staat worden gesteld geldige inschrijvingen te doen, met inbegrip van de gegevens die in het bericht van aanbesteding moeten voorkomen, met uitzondering van het in artikel IX, lid 6, onder g), genoemde, en daarenboven: 

a. het adres van de instantie waaraan de offertes moeten worden gezonden;  

b. het adres waaraan verzoeken om aanvullende informatie moeten worden gezonden;  

c. de taal of talen waarin de offertes en de daarbij behorende stukken moeten worden ingediend;  

d. uiterste datum en tijdstip waarop de offertes worden ingewacht en de periode gedurende welke een offerte moet kunnen worden aanvaard,  

e. de personen die de opening van de offertes mogen bijwonen en de datum, het tijdstip en de plaats van deze opening;  

f. economische en technische vereisten, financiële waarborgen en inlichtingen of documenten welke van leveranciers worden verlangd;  

g. een volledige beschrijving van de vereiste produkten of diensten, of van alle gestelde eisen, met inbegrip van de technische specificaties en de conformiteitscertificering waaraan moet zijn voldaan, de noodzakelijke plannen, tekeningen en aanwijzingen;  

h. de criteria voor de gunning van de opdracht, met inbegrip van alle factoren, behalve de prijs, die in aanmerking worden genomen bij de beoordeling van de offertes en de kostenelementen waarmee rekening zal worden gehouden bij de beoordeling van de inschrijvingsprijzen, zoals vervoers-, verzekerings- en inspectiekosten, en in het geval van produkten of diensten uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst, douanerechten en andere invoerheffingen, belastingen en de munteenheid waarin de betaling wordt verricht;  

i. de betalingsvoorwaarden;  

j. alle andere modaliteiten of voorwaarden;  

k. overeenkomstig artikel XVII, in voorkomend geval, de modaliteiten en voorwaarden waaronder offertes uit landen die geen Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst maar die de procedures van dat artikel toepassen, in aanmerking worden genomen.    
### *Toezending van de aanbestedingsstukken door de instanties* 

3.  

a. Bij openbare procedures doen de instanties de aanbestedingsstukken op verzoek toekomen aan iedere leverancier die aan de procedure deelneemt, en beantwoorden zij onverwijld alle redelijke verzoeken om toelichtingen ter zake.  

b. Bij procedures na voorafgaande selectie doen de instanties de aanbestedingsstukken op verzoek toekomen aan iedere leverancier die verzoekt om deelneming en beantwoorden zij onverwijld alle redelijke verzoeken om toelichtingen ter zake.  

c. De instanties beantwoorden onverwijld alle redelijke verzoeken om relevante informatie van een leverancier die deelneemt aan de aanbestedingsprocedure, mits dergelijke informatie die leverancier niet bevoordeelt ten opzichte van zijn mededingers in de procedure voor de gunning van de opdracht.     

### Artikel  XIII  

####Indiening, ontvangst en opening van offertes en gunning van opdrachten

1.  De indiening, de ontvangst en de opening van de offertes en de gunning van opdrachten geschieden overeenkomstig de volgende bepalingen: 

a. de offertes worden normaal gezien schriftelijk, rechtstreeks of per post ingediend. Wanneer offertes per telex, telegram of fax zijn toegestaan, moet de aldus ingediende offerte alle nodige gegevens voor de beoordeling van de offerte bevatten, met name de door de inschrijver aangeboden definitieve prijs en een verklaring dat de inschrijver akkoord gaat met alle voorschriften, voorwaarden en bepalingen van de uitnodiging tot inschrijving. De offerte moet onverwijld worden bevestigd bij brief of door de verzending van een ondertekend afschrift van telex, telegram of fax. Telefonisch ingediende offertes zijn niet toegestaan. De inhoud van telex, telegram of fax is rechtsgeldig wanneer een verschil of een tegenstrijdigheid bestaat tussen die inhoud en eventueel na het verstrijken van de termijn ontvangen stukken;  

b. de eventueel aan de inschrijvers gegeven gelegenheid om tussen de opening van de offertes en de gunning van de opdracht onbedoelde fouten te corrigeren, mag geen aanleiding geven tot discriminerende praktijken.    
### *Ontvangst van de offertes* 

2.  Een leverancier mag geen nadelige gevolgen ondervinden van het feit dat een offerte door de in de aanbestedingsstukken genoemde dienst pas na het verstrijken van de vastgestelde termijn wordt ontvangen indien die vertraging alleen aan de instantie te wijten is. Offertes kunnen ook in andere uitzonderlijke omstandigheden in overweging worden genomen wanneer de procedures van de betrokken instantie in die mogelijkheid voorzien.  
### *Opening van de offertes* 

3.  Bij de ontvangst en de opening van alle offertes die in openbare procedures en procedures met voorafgaande selectie worden ingediend als reactie op een uitnodiging tot inschrijving door de instanties, worden procedures en voorwaarden in acht genomen die de regelmatigheid van de opening waarborgen. De ontvangst en de opening van de offertes dienen voorts in overeenstemming te zijn met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst betreffende eigen-onderdaanbehandeling en non-discriminatie. De gegevens betreffende de opening van de offertes blijven bij de betrokken instanties berusten en staan ter beschikking van de voor de instantie verantwoordelijke autoriteiten om zo nodig te kunnen worden gebruikt bij de procedures van de artikelen XVIII, XIX, XX en XXII.  
### *Gunning van de opdrachten* 

4.  

a. Om voor gunning in aanmerking te komen moet een offerte bij de opening voldoen aan de essentiële vereisten van de aankondigingen of de aanbestedingsstukken en afkomstig zijn van een leverancier die voldoet aan de voorwaarden voor deelneming. Wanneer een instantie een offerte heeft ontvangen die in verhouding tot de andere offertes abnormaal laag is, kan zij inlichtingen inwinnen bij de inschrijver om zich ervan te vergewissen dat deze aan de deelnemingsvoorwaarden kan voldoen en in staat is de opdracht volgens de gestelde voorwaarden tot een goed einde te brengen.  

b. Tenzij een instantie in het algemeen belang besluit de opdracht niet te plaatsen, wordt deze gegund aan de inschrijver die volledig geschikt is bevonden voor de uitvoering van de opdracht en wiens offerte met betrekking tot binnenlandse produkten of diensten, dan wel produkten of diensten uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst hetzij de laagste offerte is, hetzij de offerte die volgens de in de aankondigingen of in de aanbestedingsstukken vermelde specifieke beoordelingscriteria als het voordeligst wordt erkend.  

c. De gunning geschiedt in overeenstemming met de in de aanbestedingsstukken genoemde criteria en essentiële vereisten.    
### *Optiebedingen* 

5.  Optiebedingen mogen niet worden gebruikt om de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst te omzeilen.   

### Artikel  XIV  

####Onderhandelingen

1.  Een Partij kan bepalen dat de instanties onderhandelingen voeren: 

a. in het kader van aanbestedingen waarbij zij die intentie te kennen hebben gegeven, met name via de in artikel IX, lid 2, genoemde aankondiging (de uitnodiging aan leveranciers om deel te nemen aan de procedure voor de betrokken opdracht);  

b. indien bij beoordeling blijkt dat geen enkele offerte klaarblijkelijk het voordeligste is volgens de in de aankondigingen of in de aanbestedingsstukken vermelde specifieke beoordelingscriteria.     
2.  De onderhandelingen dienen in hoofdorde om de sterke en de zwakke punten in offertes aan het licht te brengen.   
3.  De instanties behandelen de offertes vertrouwelijk. Met name verstrekken zij geen inlichtingen die erop gericht zijn bepaalde deelnemers te helpen om hun offerte op het niveau van de overige deelnemers te brengen.   
4.  De instanties maken bij de onderhandelingen geen discriminerend onderscheid tussen de verschillende leveranciers. Met name zien zij erop toe dat: 

a. een eventuele uitschakeling van deelnemers steeds verloopt volgens de in de aankondigingen of de aanbestedingsstukken vermelde criteria;  

b. alle wijzigingen aan de criteria en aan de technische vereisten schriftelijk aan alle overblijvende deelnemers aan de onderhandelingen worden medegedeeld;  

c. alle overblijvende deelnemers de gelegenheid krijgen om nieuwe of gewijzigde offertes in te dienen op grond van de gewijzigde vereisten;  

d. wanneer de onderhandelingen worden beëindigd, alle overblijvende deelnemers aan de onderhandelingen de gelegenheid krijgen om binnen een zelfde termijn een definitieve offerte in te dienen.     

### Artikel  XV  

####Onderhandse aanbesteding

1.  De bepalingen van de artikelen VII tot en met XIV met betrekking tot de openbare aanbestedingsprocedures en de procedures met voorafgaande selectie behoeven niet te worden toegepast onder de volgende omstandigheden, mits de onderhandse aanbesteding niet wordt gebruikt om een zo groot mogelijke mededinging te vermijden of op een wijze die resulteert in discriminatie tussen leveranciers uit andere landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst of bescherming van nationale producenten of leveranciers: 

a. wanneer er in het kader van een openbare aanbesteding of een aanbesteding met voorafgaande selectie geen offertes zijn ingekomen, of wanneer de ingediende offertes onderling zijn afgestemd of niet voldoen aan de essentiële voorwaarden van de aanbesteding, of afkomstig zijn van leveranciers die niet aan de overeenkomstig deze Overeenkomst gestelde voorwaarden voor deelneming voldoen, een en ander evenwel mits de vereisten van de oorspronkelijke aanbesteding niet wezenlijk zijn gewijzigd in de opdracht, zoals die wordt gegund;  

b. wanneer de produkten of diensten in het geval van kunstwerken of om redenen in verband met de bescherming van exclusieve rechten, zoals octrooien of auteursrechten, of nog bij het ontbreken van concurrentie om technische redenen, alleen kunnen worden geleverd door een bepaalde leverancier en er geen redelijk alternatief of substituut bestaat;  

c. in strikt noodzakelijke gevallen, wanneer de produkten of diensten om uiterst dringende redenen wegens gebeurtenissen die door de instantie niet konden worden voorzien niet tijdig kunnen worden verkregen door middel van openbare aanbestedingsprocedures of aanbestedingsprocedures met voorafgaande selectie;  

d. bij aanvullende leveringen door de oorspronkelijke leverancier die zijn bedoeld als vervanging van onderdelen voor reeds uitgevoerde leveringen of reeds geleverde installaties, of als uitbreiding van die leveringen, dienstverlening of installaties, indien verandering van leverancier de instantie ertoe zou nopen materiaal of diensten aan te schaffen die niet aan de vereisten van onderlinge verwisselbaarheid met het bestaande materiaal of de bestaande diensten zouden voldoen ; <sup> 1)  Onder „bestaand materiaal” dient hier ook software te worden verstaan voor zover de oorspronkelijke aanschaffing van de software onder de Overeenkomst viel.  </sup>  

e. wanneer een instantie prototypes of nieuwe produkten of diensten aanschaft die op haar verzoek tijdens de uitvoering van een specifieke opdracht inzake onderzoek, proefneming, studie of oorspronkelijke ontwikkeling ten behoeve van die opdracht zijn ontwikkeld. Wanneer dergelijke opdrachten zijn vervuld, vallen de daarop volgende aanschaffingen van produkten of diensten onder het bepaalde in de artikelen VII tot en met XIV ; <sup> 1)  De oorspronkelijke ontwikkeling van nieuwe produkten of diensten kan een beperkte produktie of levering omvatten, met de bedoeling de resultaten van veldonderzoek te verzamelen en aan te tonen dat het produkt of de dienst geschikt is om met inachtneming van aanvaardbare kwaliteitsnormen in grote hoeveelheden te worden geproduceerd of geleverd.  </sup>  

f. wanneer aanvullende bouwwerkzaamheden die niet in de aanvankelijke opdracht waren opgenomen maar die binnen de doelstellingen van de oorspronkelijke aanbestedingsstukken vallen, als gevolg van onvoorziene omstandigheden noodzakelijk zijn geworden om de daarin beschreven bouwwerkzaamheden te voltooien, en de instantie de opdrachten voor de aanvullende werkzaamheden moet gunnen aan de aannemer die de betrokken werken uitvoert omdat de scheiding van de aanvullende bouwwerkzaamheden van de oorspronkelijke opdracht om technische of economische redenen moeilijk zou zijn en de instantie aanzienlijk ongemak zou bezorgen. De totale waarde van de met het oog op de aanvullende bouwwerkzaamheden geplaatste opdrachten mag evenwel niet meer bedragen 50% van het bedrag van de hoofdopdracht;  

g. in het geval van nieuwe bouwwerkzaamheden, bestaande in de herhaling van soortgelijke werkzaamheden, welke beantwoorden aan een basisproject dat het voorwerp heeft gevormd van een overeenkomstig de artikelen VII tot en met XIV geplaatste eerste opdracht en waarbij de instantie in de aankondiging van de voorgenomen aanbesteding betreffende de eerste bouwwerkzaamheden heeft vermeld dat voor de gunning van opdrachten voor dergelijke nieuwe werkzaamheden gebruik kan worden gemaakt van onderhandse procedures;  

h. voor produkten die op een goederenmarkt worden aangekocht;  

i. voor aankopen die worden gedaan onder uitzonderlijk gunstige voorwaarden waarvan alleen op zeer korte termijn gebruik kan worden gemaakt. Deze bepaling heeft ook betrekking op ongewone uitverkopen van ondernemingen die normaliter geen leveranciers zijn en op de verkoop van de activa van ondernemingen die in vereffening zijn of onder het beheer van een curator staan. Routine-aankopen bij vaste leveranciers vallen niet onder deze bepaling;  

j. in het geval van opdrachten die worden gegund aan de winnaar van een prijsvraag, mits die prijsvraag is georganiseerd op een wijze die verenigbaar is met de beginselen van deze Overeenkomst, met name betreffende de bekendmaking, in de zin van artikel IX, van een oproep tot hiervoor erkende leveranciers, om deel te nemen aan de prijsvraag, waarbij een onafhankelijke jury de winnaars aanwijst aan wie de opdrachten voor het maken van ontwerpen worden gegund.     
2.  De instanties maken proces-verbaal op van elke opdracht die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van lid 1 is gegund. Ieder proces-verbaal bevat de naam van de aanbestedende instantie, de waarde en de aard van de aangeschafte goederen of diensten, alsmede het land van oorsprong en een uiteenzetting over de in dit artikel bedoelde omstandigheden waarin de opdracht is gegund. Dit proces-verbaal blijft bij de betrokken instanties berusten en staat ter beschikking van de voor de instantie verantwoordelijke autoriteiten om zo nodig te kunnen worden gebruikt bij de procedures van de artikelen XVIII, XIX, XX en XXII.   

### Artikel  XVI  

####Compensaties

1.  De instanties mogen bij de erkenning of keuze van leveranciers, produkten of diensten, of bij de beoordeling van offertes en de gunning van opdrachten geen compensaties eisen, vragen of in aanmerking nemen . <sup> 1)  In het kader van overheidsopdrachten zijn compensaties maatregelen die worden gebruikt om de plaatselijke ontwikkeling aan te moedigen of de betalingsbalans te verbeteren door middel van het gehalte aan binnenlandse produkten, het in licentie geven van technologie, investeringseisen, tegenprestaties of soortgelijke voorwaarden.  </sup>   
2.  Op grond van algemene beleidsoverwegingen, met name op het gebied van ontwikkeling, kan een ontwikkelingsland niettemin bij toetreding voorwaarden bedingen waaronder compensaties, zoals eisen in verband met het gehalte aan binnenlandse inbreng, mogen worden toegepast. Dergelijke eisen mogen enkel worden gebruikt bij de selectie met het oog op deelneming aan de aanbesteding, en niet als een gunningscriterium. De voorwaarden moeten objectief, duidelijk omschreven en niet-discriminerend zijn. Zij worden in de Aanhangsel I van het betrokken land opgenomen en kunnen strikte beperkingen behelzen inzake de compensaties die in elke onder deze Overeenkomst vallende opdracht kunnen worden geëist. Het bestaan van die voorwaarden moet aan het Comité worden medegedeeld en in de aankondiging van een voorgenomen aanbesteding alsmede in andere stukken worden vermeld.   

### Artikel  XVII  

####Doorzichtigheid

1.  Elke Partij moedigt de instanties aan, bekend te maken onder welke voorwaarden, met inbegrip van eventuele afwijkingen van de open aanbestedingsprocedures of de toegang tot beroepsprocedures, offertes in aanmerking zullen worden genomen die uitgaan van leveranciers uit landen die geen Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst maar die niettemin, met het oog op de doorzichtigheid van hun eigen aanbestedingen: 

a. hun opdrachten beschrijven in overeenstemming met artikel VI (technische specificaties);  

b. de in artikel IX bedoelde berichten van aanbesteding publiceren, met inbegrip van – in de versie van de in artikel IX, lid 8, bedoelde aankondiging (samenvatting van de aankondiging van een voorgenomen aanbesteding) die in een officiële taal van de WTO wordt gepubliceerd – een vermelding van de voorwaarden waaronder offertes van leveranciers uit landen die Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst in aanmerking zullen worden genomen;  

c. bereid zijn te garanderen dat hun voorschriften inzake overheidsopdrachten normaliter niet zullen worden gewijzigd in de loop van een aanbesteding en dat, indien een dergelijke wijziging onvermijdelijk is, afdoende beroepsmogelijkheden ter beschikking staan.     
2.  Regeringen van landen die geen Partij zijn bij de Overeenkomst, maar die voldoen aan de in lid 1, onder a. tot en met c., vermelde voorwaarden, hebben het recht om, indien zij de Partijen daarvan in kennis stellen, als waarnemers aan de werkzaamheden van het Comité deel te nemen.   

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Informatie en toetsing met betrekking tot de verplichtingen van de instanties

1.  Niet meer dan 72 dagen na de gunning van een opdracht overeenkomstig de artikelen XIII tot en met XV publiceren de instanties in de toepasselijke publikatie uit de lijst in Aanhangsel II steeds een mededeling, waarin de volgende gegevens voorkomen: 

a. de aard en hoeveelheid van de produkten of diensten waarop de aanbesteding betrekking had;  

b. de naam en het adres van de instantie die de opdracht heeft geplaatst;  

c. de datum waarop de opdracht is gegund;  

d. de naam en het adres van de begunstigde;  

e. het bedrag van de uitgekozen offerte ofwel de hoogste en de laagste offerte die bij de gunning van de opdracht in overweging zijn genomen;  

f. in voorkomend geval, aanwijzingen voor het terugvinden van het in artikel IX, lid 1, bedoelde bericht of een verantwoording overeenkomstig artikel XV voor het gebruik van de in dat artikel bedoelde procedure;  

g. het type procedure dat is gevolgd.     
2.  Elke instantie verstrekt aan een leverancier uit een land dat Partij is bij de Overeenkomst op diens verzoek onverwijld: 

a. een toelichting over haar werkwijze en procedures bij het plaatsen van opdrachten;  

b. relevante informatie betreffende de redenen waarom de aanvraag van de leverancier om erkenning is afgewezen, waarom diens bestaande erkenning is beëindigd of waarom hij niet is uitgekozen;  

c. in het geval van een afgewezen inschrijver, relevante informatie betreffende de redenen waarom zijn offerte niet is uitgekozen en betreffende de kenmerken en relatieve voordelen van de uitgekozen offerte, alsmede de naam van de begunstigde.     
3.  De instanties stellen de deelnemende leveranciers onverwijld en desgevraagd schriftelijk in kennis van de gunning van de opdracht.   
4.  De instanties kunnen evenwel besluiten dat bepaalde van de in lid 1 en lid 2, onder c., bedoelde gegevens betreffende de gunning van de opdracht niet worden vrijgegeven indien zulks de toepassing van wettelijke bepalingen zou belemmeren of anderszins strijdig zou zijn met het algemeen belang, de legitieme commerciële belangen van bepaalde openbare of particuliere ondernemingen zou schaden dan wel de eerlijke mededinging tussen leveranciers in het gedrang zou brengen.   

### Artikel  XIX  

####Informatie en toetsing met betrekking tot de verplichtingen van de Partijen

1.  Elke Partij maakt onverwijld alle wetten, verordeningen, rechterlijke besluiten, algemene bestuursrechtelijke beslissingen en procedures (met inbegrip van standaardclausules in overeenkomsten) met betrekking tot de in deze Overeenkomst bedoelde overheidsopdrachten bekend in de passende publikaties van de lijst in Aanhangsel IV, zodat de andere Partijen en de leveranciers daarvan kennis kunnen nemen. Elke Partij is steeds bereid andere Partijen op verzoek toelichtingen te verstrekken over haar procedures voor het plaatsen van overheidsopdrachten.   
2.  De regering van een afgewezen inschrijver die Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst kan, onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel XXII, verzoeken om aanvullende inlichtingen betreffende de gunning van de opdracht, welke noodzakelijk kunnen zijn om zich ervan te vergewissen dat de aanbesteding op eerlijke en onpartijdige wijze is verlopen. Te dien einde verstrekt de regering van de aanbestedende instantie inlichtingen betreffende de kenmerken en de relatieve voordelen van de uitgekozen offerte alsmede de prijs waarvoor de opdracht is gegund. Normaal gezien mag deze laatste inlichting door de regering van de afgewezen inschrijver worden bekendgemaakt mits daarbij discretie wordt betracht. Ingeval het vrijgeven van deze informatie nadelig zou zijn voor de mededinging bij toekomstige aanbestedingen, wordt deze informatie pas bekendgemaakt na overleg met en toestemming van de Partij die de informatie aan de regering van de afgewezen inschrijver heeft verstrekt.   
3.  Beschikbare informatie betreffende de plaatsing van opdrachten door instanties die onder de Overeenkomst vallen en de afzonderlijke, door hen geplaatste opdrachten wordt op hun verzoek aan alle andere Partijen verstrekt.   
4.  Vertrouwelijke informatie die aan een Partij is verstrekt en die de toepassing van wettelijke bepalingen zou belemmeren of anderszins strijdig zou zijn met het algemeen belang, de legitieme commerciële belangen van openbare of particuliere ondernemingen zou schaden dan wel de eerlijke mededinging tussen leveranciers in het gedrang zou brengen, wordt niet bekendgemaakt zonder formele toestemming van de Partij die de informatie heeft verstrekt.   
5.  Elke Partij stelt jaarlijkse statistieken over haar aanbestedingen op, die zij aan het Comité mededeelt. Deze mededelingen bevatten de volgende inlichtingen met betrekking tot opdrachten die door alle onder deze Overeenkomst vallende aanbestedende instanties zijn gegund 

a. voor de in Bijlage 1 genoemde instanties, statistieken over de geraamde waarde van de gegunde opdrachten, zowel onder als boven de drempelwaarde, zowel het totaalbedrag als uitgesplitst per instantie; voor de in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 genoemde instanties, statistieken over de geraamde waarde van de gegunde opdrachten boven de drempelwaarde, zowel het totaalbedrag als uitgesplitst per categorie van instanties;  

b. voor de in Bijlage 1 genoemde instanties, statistieken over het aantal en de totale waarde van de opdrachten die boven de drempelwaarde zijn gegund, ingedeeld naar instanties en naar categorieën produkten en diensten, volgens eenvormige classificatiesystemen; voor de in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 genoemde instanties, statistieken over de geraamde waarde van de opdrachten die zijn gegund, ingedeeld naar categorieën van instanties en naar categorieën produkten en diensten;  

c. voor de in Bijlage 1 genoemde instanties, statistieken, ingedeeld naar instanties en naar categorieën produkten en diensten, over het aantal en de totale waarde van de opdrachten die in elk van de in artikel XV bedoelde gevallen zijn gegund; voor de in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 genoemde instanties, statistieken over de totale waarde van de opdrachten die in elk van de in artikel XV bedoelde gevallen boven de drempelwaarde zijn gegund;  

d. voor de in Bijlage 1 genoemde instanties, statistieken, ingedeeld naar instanties, over het aantal en de totale waarde van de opdrachten die op grond van de in de desbetreffende Bijlagen bedoelde afwijkingen van de Overeenkomst zijn gegund; voor de in de Bijlagen 2 en 3 genoemde instanties, statistieken over de totale waarde van de opdrachten die op grond van de in de desbetreffende Bijlagen bedoelde afwijkingen van de Overeenkomst zijn gegund.   Voor zover dergelijke informatie beschikbaar is, verstrekt elke Partij statistieken over het land van oorsprong van de door haar instanties aangekochte produkten en diensten. Met het oog op de vergelijkbaarheid van die statistieken geeft het Comité richtsnoeren over de toe te passen methoden. Om een doeltreffend toezicht op de onder deze Overeenkomst vallende overheidsopdrachten te organiseren kan het Comité met eenparigheid van stemmen besluiten de onder a. tot en met d. genoemde vereisten te wijzigen voor wat betreft de aard en de omvang van de te verstrekken statistische gegevens en de toe te passen uitsplitsing en classificatie.   

### Artikel  XX  

####Beroepsprocedures

### *Overleg* 

1.  In geval van een klacht van een leverancier dat in het kader van een aanbesteding inbreuk is gemaakt op deze Overeenkomst, moedigt elke Partij de leverancier ertoe aan genoegdoening te zoeken door overleg met de aanbestedende instantie. In dergelijke gevallen neemt de aanbestedende instantie de betrokken klacht in ieder geval tijdig en onbevooroordeeld in beraad op een wijze die de mogelijkheid onverlet laat om in het kader van de beroepsprocedure te verkrijgen dat de inbreuk ongedaan wordt gemaakt.  
### *Beroepsmogelijkheden* 

2.  Elke Partij zorgt voor niet-discriminerende, snelle, doorzichtige en doeltreffende procedures die leveranciers in staat stellen beroep in te stellen tegen beweerde inbreuken op de Overeenkomst die zich hebben voorgedaan in het kader van aanbestedingen waarbij zij een belang hebben of hadden.   
3.  Elke Partij legt haar beroepsprocedures schriftelijk vast en maakt ze voor iedereen toegankelijk.   
4.  Elke Partij ziet erop toe dat de stukken betreffende alle aspecten van de aanbestedingsprocedures die onder deze Overeenkomst vallen gedurende drie jaar worden bewaard.   
5.  Er kan worden bepaald dat de belanghebbende leverancier zijn beroep moet instellen en de aanbestedende instantie daarvan in kennis moet stellen binnen een bepaalde termijn te rekenen vanaf het tijdstip waarop de reden voor de klacht hem bekend was of redelijkerwijs had moeten zijn, maar die termijn mag in geen geval korter zijn dan 10 dagen.   
6.  Elk beroep wordt voorgelegd aan een rechterlijke instantie of een onafhankelijke beroepsinstantie die geen belang heeft bij het resultaat van de aanbesteding en waarvan de leden in de uitoefening van hun functie niet blootstaan aan externe beïnvloeding. Indien het een niet-rechterlijke beroepsinstantie betreft, moet hoger beroep bij een rechterlijke instantie mogelijk zijn of moeten de regels inzake procesvoering bepalen dat: 

a. de deelnemers kunnen worden gehoord voordat een advies wordt gegeven of een beslissing wordt genomen;  

b. de deelnemers zich mogen laten vertegenwoordigen en bijstaan;  

c. de deelnemers toegang hebben tot alle proceduremogelijkheden;  

d. de procedure in het openbaar kan plaatsvinden;  

e. adviezen of beslissingen schriftelijk worden uitgebracht en met redenen worden omkleed;  

f. getuigen kunnen worden gehoord;  

g. alle stukken ter inzage worden gegeven aan de beroepsinstantie.     
7.  De beroepsprocedures voorzien in: 

a. snel te nemen voorlopige maatregelen om inbreuken op de Overeenkomst ongedaan te maken en een ieders commerciële kansen gaaf te houden. Een dergelijke actie kan aanleiding geven tot een opschorting van de aanbestedingsprocedure. Er kan evenwel worden bepaald dat bij het nemen van de beslissing over het al dan niet toepassen van dergelijke maatregelen rekening mag worden gehouden met mogelijke zware negatieve gevolgen voor de belangen die op het spel staan, waaronder het algemeen belang. In dergelijke gevallen wordt de beslissing om niet op te treden schriftelijk met redenen omkleed;  

b. een afweging en de mogelijkheid van een beslissing over de motivering van het beroep;  

c. het ongedaan maken van de inbreuk op de Overeenkomst of vergoeding van het geleden verlies of de geleden schade, welke kan worden beperkt tot de kosten van het opstellen van een offerte of van het protest.     
8.  Ter bescherming van de commerciële en andere belangen die op het spel staan, moet de beroepsprocedure normaliter met bekwame spoed worden afgerond.   

### Artikel  XXI  

####Instellingen

1.  Uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomst wordt een Comité voor overheidsopdrachten ingesteld, bestaande uit vertegenwoordigers van elk der Partijen. Het Comité kiest zijn voorzitter en komt zo vaak noodzakelijk is, maar ten minste eenmaal per jaar, bijeen om de Partijen in de gelegenheid te stellen overleg te plegen over alle vraagstukken met betrekking tot de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst of de bevordering van de doelstellingen ervan en om de andere taken te vervullen die het van de Partijen eventueel krijgt opgedragen.   
2.  Het Comité kan in voorkomend geval werkgroepen of andere nevenorganen instellen die de taken vervullen die hun door het Comité worden opgedragen.   

### Artikel  XXII  

####Overleg en beslechting van geschillen

1.  De bepalingen van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming inzake de regels en procedures betreffende de beslechting van geschillen in het kader van de WTO-Overeenkomst (hierna te noemen het „Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting”) zijn van toepassing behalve indien hieronder uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald.   
2.  Indien een Partij van mening is dat een voordeel dat zij direct of indirect uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomst geniet teniet wordt gedaan of wordt uitgehold, of dat de verwezenlijking van één van de doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst in het geding komt door het feit dat een andere Partij of andere Partijen de verplichtingen niet nakomen die krachtens deze Overeenkomst op hen rusten, kan zij met het oog op het bereiken van een wederzijds bevredigende regeling schriftelijk haar bezwaren of voorstellen kenbaar maken aan de Partij of Partijen die zij betrokken acht. Daarvan wordt onverwijld kennis gegeven aan het bij het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting opgerichte Orgaan voor Geschillenbeslechting (hierna te noemen „het DSB”). Iedere Partij die aldus wordt aangesproken, neemt de gemaakte bezwaren en gedane voorstellen welwillend in overweging.   
3.  Het DSB heeft de bevoegdheid panels te vormen, de rapporten van panels en van de Beroepsinstantie aan te nemen, aanbevelingen of uitspraken te doen over de zaak, toezicht te houden op de tenuitvoerlegging van uitspraken of aanbevelingen en de schorsing toe te staan van concessies en andere verplichtingen die uit deze Overeenkomst voortvloeien, dan wel machtiging te verlenen voor overleg over middelen tot rechtsherstel wanneer intrekking van de inbreukmakende maatregelen niet mogelijk is, mits alleen Leden van de WTO die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst deelnemen aan de beslissingen of maatregelen die door het DSB worden genomen met betrekking tot geschillen die verband houden met deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  Panels hebben de volgende taakomschrijving, tenzij de partijen bij het geschil binnen twintig dagen na de vorming van het panel anders overeenkomen: 

„In het licht van de desbetreffende bepalingen in deze Overeenkomst en in (naam van een eventueel door de partijen bij het geschil aangehaalde andere vermelde overeenkomst) de door (naam van de partij) in document ... aan het DSB voorgelegde zaak te bestuderen en tot de conclusies te komen die het DSB zullen helpen bij het doen van de aanbevelingen of uitspraken als bedoeld in deze Overeenkomst”.   In het geval van een geschil waarbij door een van de partijen zowel op bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst als van een of meer andere van de in Aanhangsel 1 bij het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting opgesomde Overeenkomsten een beroep wordt gedaan, is lid 3 slechts van toepassing op die gedeelten van het rapport van het panel die betrekking hebben op de uitlegging en de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst.   
5.  In de panels die door het DSB worden gevormd om geschillen te behandelen die gebaseerd zijn op deze Overeenkomst, hebben personen zitting die ervaring hebben op het gebied van overheidsopdrachten.   
6.  Alles wordt in het werk gesteld om de procedure zo snel mogelijk te laten verlopen. In afwijking van het bepaalde in de leden 8 en 9 van artikel 12 van het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting tracht het panel zijn eindrapport aan de partijen bij het geschil te bezorgen niet meer dan vier maanden, en in geval van vertraging niet meer dan zeven maanden, na het tijdstip waarop de samenstelling en de taakomschrijving van het panel zijn overeengekomen. Bijgevolg wordt tevens alles in het werk gesteld om de in artikel 20, lid 1, en artikel 21, lid 4, van het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting bedoelde termijnen met twee maanden te verkorten. In afwijking van het bepaalde in artikel 21, lid 5, van het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting tracht het panel voorts, bij een geschil over het bestaan van maatregelen genomen ter naleving van de aanbevelingen of uitspraken of over de verenigbaarheid van die maatregelen met een vermelde Overeenkomst, zijn beslissing binnen zestig dagen te geven.   
7.  In afwijking van het bepaalde in artikel 22, lid 2, van het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting geeft geen enkel geschil dat voortvloeit uit een van de in Aanhangsel 1 bij het Memorandum inzake geschillenbeslechting opgenomen Overeenkomsten, behalve deze Overeenkomst, aanleiding tot de schorsing van concessies of andere verplichtingen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst; evenmin geeft een geschil dat voortvloeit uit deze Overeenkomst aanleiding tot de schorsing van concessies of andere verplichtingen ingevolge een van de andere in het genoemde Aanhangsel 1 opgenomen Overeenkomsten.   

### Artikel  XXIII  

####Uitzonderingen op de Overeenkomst

1.  Geen enkele bepaling van deze Overeenkomst mag zodanig worden uitgelegd dat zij een Partij belet maatregelen te nemen of verplicht gegevens te verstrekken die zij nodig acht ter bescherming van het wezenlijke belang van haar veiligheid met betrekking tot de aanschaf van wapens, munitie of oorlogstuig of aanschaffingen die onmisbaar zijn voor de nationale veiligheid of voor nationale verdedigingsdoeleinden.   
2.  Op voorwaarde dat de betrokken maatregelen niet zodanig worden toegepast, dat zij een middel vormen hetzij tot willekeurige of ongerechtvaardigde discriminatie tussen landen waar dezelfde omstandigheden heersen, hetzij tot een verkapte beperking van de internationale handel, wordt niets in deze Overeenkomst zodanig uitgelegd dat zij een Partij belet maatregelen te nemen of toe te passen die noodzakelijk zijn ter bescherming van de openbare zeden, orde of veiligheid, het leven of de gezondheid van mensen, dieren of planten, de intellectuele eigendom, of die betrekking hebben op artikelen gemaakt door gehandicapten, in liefdadigheidsinstellingen of in gevangenissen.   

### Artikel  XXIV  

####Slotbepalingen

1.  
### *Aanvaarding en inwerkingtreding* 

Deze Overeenkomst treedt op 1 januari 1996 in werking voor de regeringen wier onderling overeengekomen lijsten van alles waarop de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst van toepassing zijn in de Bijlagen 1 tot en met 5 van Aanhangsel I bij deze Overeenkomst zijn opgenomen en die, door ondertekening, de Overeenkomst van 15 april 1994 hebben aanvaard of die de Overeenkomst op die datum hebben ondertekend onder voorbehoud van ratificatie en de Overeenkomst vervolgens vóór 1 januari 1996 hebben geratificeerd. <sup> 1)  In de zin van deze Overeenkomst worden onder het begrip „regering” mede verstaan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Europese Gemeenschappen.  </sup>   
2.  
### *Toetreding* 

Iedere regering die Lid is van de WTO, of, vóór de inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst, die Verdragsluitende Partij is bij de GATT, en geen Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, kan hiertoe toetreden op tussen deze regering en de Partijen overeen te komen voorwaarden. De toetreding vindt plaats door nederlegging bij de Directeur-Generaal van de WTO van een toetredingsinstrument waarin de aldus overeengekomen voorwaarden zijn opgenomen. De Overeenkomst treedt voor een toetredende regering in werking op de 30e dag na haar toetreding tot de Overeenkomst.   
3.  
### *Overgangsregelingen* 

a. Hong Kong en Korea kunnen de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, met uitzondering van het bepaalde in de artikelen XXI en XXII, uitstellen tot uiterlijk 1 januari 1997. Indien de aanvangsdatum van de toepassing van de bepalingen door deze landen vóór 1 januari 1997 valt, wordt de Directeur-Generaal van de WTO hiervan 30 dagen van tevoren in kennis gesteld.  

b. Gedurende de periode tussen de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst en de datum van toepassing ervan door Hong Kong worden de wederzijdse rechten en verplichtingen van Hong Kong enerzijds en alle andere Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst die op 15 april 1994 Partij waren bij de Overeenkomst inzake overheidsopdrachten van Genève van 12 april 1979, gewijzigd op 2 februari 1987 (de „Overeenkomst van 1988”), anderzijds geregeld door de materiële bepalingen van de Overeenkomst van 1988, met inbegrip van de Bijlagen, zoals gewijzigd of gerectificeerd; deze bepalingen maken met het oog daarop door middel van verwijzing deel uit van deze Overeenkomst en blijven van kracht tot 31 december 1996. <sup> 2)  Alle bepalingen van de Overeenkomst van 1988 met uitzondering van de Preambule, artikel VII en artikel IX, dit laatste behoudens lid 5, onder a. en b., en lid 10.  </sup>  

c. In de betrekkingen tussen Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst die ook Partij waren bij de Overeenkomst van 1988 vervangen de rechten en verplichtingen die uit deze Overeenkomst voortvloeien die welke uit hoofde van de Overeenkomst van 1988 golden.  

d. Artikel XXII treedt pas in werking op het tijdstip van inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst. Tot dat tijdstip blijven de bepalingen van artikel VII van de Overeenkomst van 1988 van toepassing op overleg en beslechting van geschillen in het kader van deze Overeenkomst; deze bepalingen maken met het oog daarop door middel van verwijzing deel uit van deze Overeenkomst. Deze bepalingen worden toegepast onder de auspiciën van het Comité dat in het kader van deze Overeenkomst is opgericht.  

e. Vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst worden verwijzingen naar WTO-organen geacht te verwijzen naar de overeenkomstige GATT-organen en worden verwijzingen naar de Directeur-Generaal van de WTO en naar het WTO-Secretariaat geacht te verwijzen naar respectievelijk de Directeur-Generaal van de Verdragsluitende Partijen bij de GATT en het GATT-Secretariaat.     
4.  
### *Voorbehoud* 

Ten aanzien van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst mag geen voorbehoud worden gemaakt.   
5.  
### *Nationale wetgeving* 

a. Iedere regering die deze Overeenkomst aanvaardt of daartoe toetreedt, draagt er uiterlijk op de datum waarop deze Overeenkomst te haren aanzien in werking treedt, zorg voor dat haar wetten, verordeningen en administratieve procedures alsmede de regels, procedures en praktijken welke door de in de aan deze Overeenkomst gehechte lijst vermelde instanties worden toegepast, in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.  

b. Iedere Partij stelt het Comité in kennis van elke wijziging in haar wetten en verordeningen die voor deze Overeenkomst van belang zijn, en in de uitvoering van die wetten en verordeningen.     
6.  
### *Rectificaties of wijzigingen* 

a. Rectificaties, het overbrengen van een instantie van de ene Bijlage naar de andere en, in uitzonderlijke gevallen, andere wijzigingen met betrekking tot de Aanhangsels I tot en met IV bij deze Overeenkomst worden aan het Comité medegedeeld, tezamen met inlichtingen over de vermoedelijke gevolgen van de wijziging voor de onderling overeengekomen werkingssfeer van deze Overeenkomst. Indien de rectificaties, overbrenging of andere wijzigingen van zuiver formele aard of van gering belang zijn, worden zij van kracht wanneer daartegen niet binnen 30 dagen bezwaar is gemaakt. In andere gevallen roept de voorzitter van het Comité onverwijld een vergadering van het Comité bijeen. Het Comité neemt het voorstel en elke eventuele vordering tot compenserende aanpassingen in beraad met als oogmerk dat rechten en verplichtingen in evenwicht worden gehouden en de onderling overeengekomen werkingssfeer van deze Overeenkomst op een vergelijkbaar niveau blijft als vóór de wijziging. Indien geen overeenstemming wordt bereikt, kan de aangelegenheid worden behandeld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel XXII.  

b. Indien een Partij, gebruik makend van haar rechten, een instantie uit Aanhangsel I wil verwijderen omdat de zeggenschap of invloed van de overheid ten aanzien van die instantie daadwerkelijk is beëindigd, stelt die Partij het Comité daarvan in kennis. Een dergelijke wijziging wordt van kracht de dag na het einde van de volgende bijeenkomst van het Comité, voor zover die bijeenkomst niet minder dan 30 dagen na het tijdstip van de kennisgeving plaatsvindt en er geen bezwaar is gemaakt. Indien bezwaar is gemaakt, kan de zaak verder worden afgehandeld volgens de procedures op het gebied van overleg en geschillenbeslechting als bedoeld in artikel XXII. Bij de beoordeling van de voorgestelde wijziging in Aanhangsel I en de eventuele compenserende aanpassingen dient rekening te worden gehouden met de mate waarin het opheffen van zeggenschap of invloed van de overheid de markt openstelt.     
7.  
### *Toetsing, onderhandelingen en toekomstige ontwikkelingen* 

a. Het Comité toetst ieder jaar de tenuitvoerlegging en de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, zulks met inachtneming van de doelstellingen ervan. Het Comité stelt elk jaar de Algemene Raad van de WTO op de hoogte van de ontwikkelingen die zich gedurende de periode waarop die toetsing betrekking heeft, hebben voorgedaan.  

b. Uiterlijk na het verstrijken van het derde jaar te rekenen vanaf de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst en vervolgens op gezette tijden voeren de Partijen bij deze Overeenkomst verdere onderhandelingen ten einde deze Overeenkomst op basis van onderlinge wederkerigheid te verbeteren en voor alle Partijen de grootst mogelijke uitbreiding van de werkingssfeer te bewerkstelligen, een en ander met inachtneming van het bepaalde in artikel V met betrekking tot de ontwikkelingslanden.  

c. De Partijen trachten geen discriminerende maatregelen en praktijken in te voeren of in stand te houden die tot een verstoring van het open aanbestedingsklimaat leiden, en streven er in het kader van de onder b. bedoelde onderhandelingen naar die welke bij de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst nog bestaan uit de weg te ruimen.     
8.  
### *Informatietechnologie* 

Om te voorkomen dat de Overeenkomst de technische vooruitgang onnodig zou belemmeren plegen de Partijen in het Comité geregeld overleg over de ontwikkelingen in het gebruik van de informatietechnologie bij het plaatsen van overheidsopdrachten en besluiten zij, indien nodig, na onderhandelingen tot aanpassingen aan de Overeenkomst. Dit overleg heeft met name ten doel te garanderen dat het gebruik van de informatietechnologie de doelstellingen ter zake van een open, niet-discriminerende en doeltreffende aanbesteding van overheidsopdrachten door middel van doorzichtige procedures bevordert, dat duidelijk bepaald is welke opdrachten onder de Overeenkomst vallen en dat alle beschikbare informatie betreffende een bepaalde opdracht kan worden teruggevonden. Indien een Partij voornemens is een innovatie in te voeren, tracht zij daarbij rekening te houden met de standpunten die andere Partijen ten aanzien van eventuele moeilijkheden hebben ingenomen.   
9.  
### *Aanpassingen* 

De Partijen kunnen deze Overeenkomst onder meer aanpassen in het licht van de bij de tenuitvoerlegging ervan opgedane ervaring. Indien een aanpassing door de Partijen overeenkomstig de door het Comité vastgestelde procedures is overeengekomen, treedt deze aanpassing voor een Partij pas in werking wanneer deze door deze Partij is aanvaard.   
10.  
### *Opzegging* 

a. Iedere Partij kan deze Overeenkomst opzeggen. De opzegging wordt van kracht na het verstrijken van een termijn van 60 dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop de Directeur-generaal van de WTO hiervan schriftelijke kennisgeving heeft ontvangen. Na ontvangst van deze kennisgeving kan elke Partij om onmiddellijke bijeenroeping van het Comité verzoeken.  

b. Indien een Partij bij deze Overeenkomst geen Lid wordt van de WTO binnen een jaar te rekenen vanaf de inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst of ophoudt Lid te zijn van de WTO, houdt zij op dezelfde datum op Partij te zijn bij deze Overeenkomst.     
11.  
### *Niet-toepassing van deze Overeenkomst tussen bepaalde Partijen* 

Deze Overeenkomst is niet van toepassing tussen twee Partijen, indien een van deze Partijen, op het tijdstip dat zij deze Overeenkomst aanvaardt of hiertoe toetreedt, niet instemt met deze toepassing.   
12.  
### *Aantekeningen, Aanhangsels en Bijlagen* 

De Aantekeningen, Aanhangsels en Bijlagen maken integrerend deel uit van deze Overeenkomst.   
13.  
### *Secretariaat* 

Het Secretariaat van de WTO neemt het secretariaat van deze Overeenkomst waar.   
14.  
### *Nederlegging* 

Deze Overeenkomst wordt nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal van de WTO, die aan elke Partij onverwijld een voor eensluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift toezendt van deze Overeenkomst, alsmede van elke rectificatie of wijziging die hierin overeenkomstig lid 6 is aangebracht en van elke aanpassing die hierin overeenkomstig lid 9 is aangebracht, alsook een kennisgeving van elke aanvaarding of toetreding overeenkomstig de leden 1 en 2 en van elke opzegging overeenkomstig lid 10.   
15.

Deze Overeenkomst zal worden geregistreerd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 102 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties.   

GEDAAN te Marrakesh, vijftien april negentienhonderd vierennegentig, in één exemplaar in de Engelse, de Franse en de Spaanse taal, zijnde elke tekst authentiek, behalve indien met betrekking tot de Aanhangsels bij deze Overeenkomst anders is aangegeven.  

### AANTEKENINGEN  

De uitdrukkingen „land” of „landen” zoals gebruikt in deze Overeenkomst, met inbegrip van de Aanhangsels, worden geacht elk afzonderlijk douanegebied te omvatten dat Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst. Ingeval een afzonderlijk douanegebied Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, wordt een uitdrukking in deze Overeenkomst, wanneer deze nader wordt omschreven met het woord „nationaal”, geïnterpreteerd als betrekking hebbend op dat douanegebied, tenzij anders aangegeven. 
### *Artikel I, lid 1* 

Gezien de algemene beleidslijnen met betrekking tot gebonden hulp, met inbegrip van het streven van de ontwikkelingslanden met betrekking tot niet-gebonden hulp, is deze Overeenkomst niet van toepassing op opdrachten ter bevordering van gebonden hulp aan ontwikkelingslanden, zolang de Partijen deze hulp verstrekken.
