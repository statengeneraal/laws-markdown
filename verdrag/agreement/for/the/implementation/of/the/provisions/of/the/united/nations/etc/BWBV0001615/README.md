####CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

### Article  5  

####General principles

In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate in accordance with the Convention: 

a) adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and promote the objective of their optimum utilization;  

b) ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;  

c) apply the precautionary approach in accordance with article 6;  

d) assess the impacts of fishing, other human activities and environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks;  

e) adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks, with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened;  

f) minimize pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species (hereinafter referred to as non-target species) and impacts on associated or dependent species, in particular endangered species, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques;  

g) protect biodiversity in the marine environment;  

h) take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources;  

i) take into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers;  

j) collect and share, in a timely manner, complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities on, *inter alia,* vessel position, catch of target and non-target species and fishing effort, as set out in Annex I, as well as information from national and international research programmes;  

k) promote and conduct scientific research and develop appropriate technologies in support of fishery conservation and management; and  

l) implement and enforce conservation and management measures through effective monitoring, control and surveillance.    

### Article  6  

####Application of the precautionary approach

1.  States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.   
2.  States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.   
3.  In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall; 

a) improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty;  

b) apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;  

c) take into account, *inter alia,* uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and socio-economic conditions; and  

d) develop data collection and research programmes to assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species and their environment, and adopt plans which are necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to protect habitats of special concern.     
4.  States shall take measures to ensure that, when reference points are approached, they will not be exceeded. In the event that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the action determined under paragraph 3 (b) to restore the stocks.   
5.  Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review their status and the efficacy of conservation and management measures. They shall revise those measures regularly in the light of new information.   
6.  For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon as possible cautious conservation and management measures, including, *inter alia*, catch limits and effort limits. Such measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability of the stocks, whereupon conservation and management measures based on that assessment shall be implemented. The latter measures shall, if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.   
7.  If a natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States shall adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States shall also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where fishing activity presents a serious threat to the sustainability of such stocks. Measures taken on an emergency basis shall be temporary and shall be based on the best scientific evidence available.   

### Article  7  

####Compatibility of conservation and management measures

1.  Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention, and the right of all States for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas in accordance with the Convention: 

a) with respect to straddling fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and the States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the adjacent high seas area shall seek, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent high seas area;  

b) with respect to highly migratory fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and other States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the region shall cooperate, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilization of such stocks throughout the region, both within and beyond the areas under national jurisdiction.     
2.  Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their entirety. To this end, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate for the purpose of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks. In determining compatible conservation and management measures, States shall: 

a) take into account the conservation and management measures adopted and applied in accordance with article 61 of the Convention in respect of the same stocks by coastal States within areas under national jurisdiction and ensure that measures established in respect of such stocks for the high seas do not undermine the effectiveness of such measures;  

b) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied for the high seas in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas;  

c) take into account previously agreed measures established and applied in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;  

d) take into account the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the stocks and the relationships between the distribution of the stocks, the fisheries and the geographical particularities of the region concerned, including the extent to which the stocks occur and are fished in areas under national jurisdiction;  

e) take into account the respective dependence of the coastal States and the States fishing on the high seas on the stocks concerned; and  

f) ensure that such measures do not result in harmful impact on the living marine resources as a whole.     
3.  In giving effect to their duty to cooperate, States shall make every effort to agree on compatible conservation and management measures within a reasonable period of time.   
4.  If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, any of the States concerned may invoke the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.   
5.  Pending agreement on compatible conservation and management measures, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature. In the event that they are unable to agree on such arrangements, any of the States concerned may, for the purpose of obtaining provisional measures, submit the dispute to a court or tribunal in accordance with the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.   
6.  Provisional arrangements or measures entered into or prescribed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall take into account the provisions of this Part, shall have due regard to the rights and obligations of all States concerned, shall not jeopardize or hamper the reaching of final agreement on compatible conservation and management measures and shall be without prejudice to the final outcome of any dispute settlement procedure.   
7.  Coastal States shall regularly inform States fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within areas under their national jurisdiction.   
8.  States fishing on the high seas shall regularly inform other interested States, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for regulating the activities of vessels flying their flag which fish for such stocks on the high seas.

Information on the progress and outcome of the investigations shall be provided to all States having an interest in, or affected by, the alleged violation.   
4.  States shall assist each other in identifying vessels reported to have engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures.   
5.  States shall, to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, establish arrangements for making available to prosecuting authorities in other States evidence relating to alleged violations of such measures.   
6.  Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorized fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorize the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to article 111 of the Convention.   
7.  States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organization or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.   

### Article  21  

####Subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement

1.  In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organization or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorized inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organization or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organization or arrangement.   
2.  States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organization or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.   
3.  If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organization or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22.   
4.  Prior to taking action under this article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorized inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, a State shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.   
5.  Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.   
6.  The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either: 

a) fulfil, without delay, its obligations under article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting State of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or  

b) authorize the inspecting State to investigate.     
7.  Where the flag State authorizes the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorize the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.   
8.  Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.   
9.  The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organization or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.   
10.  The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimize interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.   
11.  For the purposes of this article, a serious violation means: 

a) fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3 (a);  

b) failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organization or arrangement;  

c) fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;  

d) directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;  

e) using prohibited fishing gear;  

f) falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;  

g) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;  

h) multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or  

i) such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.     
12.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.   
13.  This article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.   
14.  This article applies *mutatis mutandis* to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organization or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.   
15.  Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organization or arrangement, members of such organization or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.   
16.  Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.   
17.  Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.   
18.  States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this article.   

### Article  22  

####Basic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to article 21

1.  The inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors: 

a) present credentials to the master of the vessel and produce a copy of the text of the relevant conservation and management measures or rules and regulations in force in the high seas area in question pursuant to those measures;  

b) initiate notice to the flag State at the time of the boarding and inspection;  

c) do not interfere with the master's ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag State during the boarding and inspection;  

d) provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag State, noting therein any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;  

e) promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and  

f) avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.     
2.  The duly authorized inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.   
3.  The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters: 

a) accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;  

b) cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;  

c) do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;  

d) allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;  

e) provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors; and  

f) facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.     
4.  In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this article and article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel's authorization to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. The flag State shall advise the inspecting State of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise.   

### Article  23  

####Measures taken by a port State

1.  A port State has the right and the duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional and global conservation and management measures. When taking such measures a port State shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the vessels of any State.   
2.  A port State may, inter alia, inspect documents, fishing gear and catch on board fishing vessels, when such vessels are voluntarily in its ports or at its offshore terminals.   
3.  States may adopt regulations empowering the relevant national authorities to prohibit landings and transshipments where it has been established that the catch has been taken in a manner which undermines the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures on the high seas.   
4.  Nothing in this article affects the exercise by States of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law.

### ANNEX  I  

####Standard requirements for the collection and sharing of data

### Article  1  

####General principles

1.  The timely collection, compilation and analysis of data are fundamental to the effective conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, data from fisheries for these stocks on the high seas and those in areas under national jurisdiction are required and should be collected and compiled in such a way as to enable statistically meaningful analysis for the purposes of fishery resource conservation and management. These data include catch and fishing effort statistics and other fishery-related information, such as vessel-related and other data for standardizing fishing effort. Data collected should also include information on non-target and associated or dependent species. All data should be verified to ensure accuracy. Confidentiality of non-aggregated data shall be maintained. The dissemination of such data shall be subject to the terms on which they have been provided.   
2.  Assistance, including training as well as financial and technical assistance, shall be provided to developing States in order to build capacity in the field of conservation and management of living marine resources. Assistance should focus on enhancing capacity to implement data collection and verification, observer programmes, data analysis and research projects supporting stock assessments. The fullest possible involvement of developing State scientists and managers in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks should be promoted.   

### Article  2  

####Principles of data collection, compilation and exchange

The following general principles should be considered in defining the parameters for collection, compilation and exchange of data from fishing operations for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks: 

a) States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method (e.g., each individual tow for trawl, each set for long-line and purse-seine, each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment;  

b) States should ensure that fishery data are verified through an appropriate system;  

c) States should compile fishery-related and other supporting scientific data and provide them in an agreed format and in a timely manner to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement where one exists. Otherwise, States should cooperate to exchange data either directly or through such other cooperative mechanisms as may be agreed among them;  

d) States should agree, within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or otherwise, on the specification of data and the format in which they are to be provided, in accordance with this Annex and taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks in the region. Such organizations or arrangements should request non-members or non-participants to provide data concerning relevant fishing activities by vessels flying their flag;  

e) such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement; and  

f) scientists of the flag State and from the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement should analyse the data separately or jointly, as appropriate.    

### Article  3  

####Basic fishery data

1.  States shall collect and make available to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement the following types of data in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment in accordance with agreed procedures: 

a) time series of catch and effort statistics by fishery and fleet;  

b) total catch in number, nominal weight, or both, by species (both target and non-target) as is appropriate to each fishery. [Nominal weight is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the live-weight equivalent of the landings];  

c) discard statistics, including estimates where necessary, reported as number or nominal weight by species, as is appropriate to each fishery;  

d) effort statistics appropriate to each fishing method; and  

e) fishing location, date and time fished and other statistics on fishing operations as appropriate.     
2.  States shall also collect where appropriate and provide to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangeement information to support stock assessment, including: 

a) composition of the catch according to length, weight and sex;  

b) other biological information supporting stock assessments, such as information on age, growth, recruitment, distribution and stock identity; and  

c) other relevant research, including surveys of abundance, biomass surveys, hydro-acoustic surveys, research on environmental factors affecting stock abundance, and oceanographic and ecological studies.     

### Article  4  

####Vessel data and information

1.  States should collect the following types of vessel-related data for standardizing fleet composition and vessel fishing power and for converting between different measures of effort in the analysis of catch and effort data: 

a) vessel identification, flag and port of registry;  

b) vessel type;  

c) vessel specifications (e.g., material of construction, date built, registered length, gross registered tonnage, power of main engines, hold capacity and catch storage methods); and  

d) fishing gear description (e.g., types, gear specifications and quantity).     
2.  The flag State will collect the following information: 

a) navigation and position fixing aids;  

b) communication equipment and international radio call sign; and  

c) crew size.     

### Article  5  

####Reporting

A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, logbook data on catch and effort, including data on fishing operations on the high seas, at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations. Such data shall be transmitted, where necessary, by radio, telex, facsimile or satellite transmission or by other means.  

### Article  6  

####Data verification

States or, as appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as: 

a) position verification through vessel monitoring systems;  

b) scientific observer programmes to monitor catch, effort, catch composition (target and non-target) and other details of fishing operations;  

c) vessel trip, landing and transshipment reports; and  

d) port sampling.    

### Article  7  

####Data exchange

1.  Data collected by flag States must be shared with other flag States and relevant coastal States through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements. Such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement, while maintaining confidentiality of non-aggregated data, and should, to the extent feasible, develop database systems which provide efficient access to data.   
2.  At the global level, collection and dissemination of data should be effected through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement does not exist, that organization may also do the same at the subregional or regional level by arrangement with the States concerned.   

### ANNEX  II  

####Guidelines for the application of precautionary reference points in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks

### 1  

A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management.  

### 2  

Two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. Limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. Target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.  

### 3  

Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, inter alia, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.  

### 4  

Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. Such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. Management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.  

### 5  

Fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. If a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.  

### 6  

When information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. Provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and betterknown stocks. In such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.  

### 7  

The fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. For stocks which are not overfished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a predefined threshold. For overfished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.

### DEEL  II  

####INSTANDHOUDING EN BEHEER VAN DE GRENSOVERSCHRIJDENDE EN DE OVER GROTE AFSTANDEN TREKKENDE VISBESTANDEN

### Artikel  5  

####Algemene beginselen

Met het oog op de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden dienen de Kuststaten en de Staten die op de volle zee vissen, bij het uitvoeren van de in het Zeerechtverdrag neergelegde plicht tot samenwerking 

a. maatregelen te nemen voor de instandhouding op lange termijn van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden, en voor een optimaal gebruik daarvan;  

b. die maatregelen te baseren op de beste beschikbare wetenschappelijke gegevens en af te stemmen op behoud van de visbestanden of op herstel daarvan tot een niveau waarbij de maximale duurzame opbrengst wordt verkregen, daarbij rekening houdende met relevante milieutechnische en economische factoren, waaronder de bijzondere omstandigheden van ontwikkelingslanden, en met de visserijpatronen, de onderlinge afhankelijkheid van de visbestanden en algemeen aanbevolen internationale minimumnormen die in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband zijn vastgesteld;  

c. de preventieve aanpak toe te passen overeenkomstig artikel 6;  

d. te evalueren welke effecten de visserij, andere menselijke activiteiten en milieufactoren hebben op de bestanden die het doel zijn van de visserij en op de soorten die tot hetzelfde ecosysteem behoren of die verwant zijn met of afhankelijk zijn van genoemde doelbestanden;  

e. zo nodig instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen vast te stellen om de bestanden van soorten die tot hetzelfde ecosysteem behoren als of die verwant zijn met of afhankelijk zijn van de doelbestanden boven een niveau te houden of weer boven een niveau te brengen waarbeneden de reproduktie ernstig in gevaar kan komen;  

f. vervuiling, afval, teruggooi, vangsten door verloren gegaan of opgegeven vistuig, vangsten van niet-doelsoorten, zowel vis als andere soorten (hierna „niet-doelsoorten" genoemd), en de effecten van een en ander op verwante of afhankelijke soorten, in het bijzonder bedreigde soorten, tot een minimum te beperken via maatregelen die, in de mate van het mogelijke, ontwikkeling en gebruik omvatten van vistuig en vismethoden die selectief en milieuveilig zijn en waarvan de kosten/baten-verhouding gunstig is;  

g. de biodiversiteit in het mariene milieu te beschermen;  

h. maatregelen te nemen om overbevissing en overcapaciteit te voorkomen of daaraan een einde te maken en ervoor te zorgen dat de visserijinspanning niet groter is dan een niveau dat verenigbaar is met een duurzaam gebruik van de visbestanden;  

i. rekening te houden met de belangen van de zelfvoorzieningsvissers;  

j. overeenkomstig het bepaalde in bijlage I tijdig volledige en nauwkeurige gegevens over de visserijactiviteiten te verzamelen, waaronder gegevens met betrekking tot de positie van de vaartuigen, de vangsten van doelsoorten en niet-doelsoorten en de visserij-inspanning, en die gegevens, alsmede de informatie uit nationale en internationale onderzoekprogramma's met andere te delen;  

k. wetenschappelijk onderzoek te bevorderen en te verrichten, en technieken te ontwikkelen die kunnen bijdragen tot instandhouding en het beheer van de visbestanden, en  

l. de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen toe te passen en te doen naleven via doeltreffende monitoring-, controle- en toezichtregelingen.    

### Artikel  6  

####Preventieve aanpak

1.  Ter bescherming van de levende rijkdommen van de zee en voor het behoud van het mariene milieu volgen de Staten voor de instandhouding, het beheer en de exploitatie van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden op ruime schaal de preventieve aanpak.   
2.  De Staten zijn extra voorzichtig wanneer de informatie twijfelachtig, onbetrouwbaar of niet adequaat is. Het ontbreken van adequate informatie is geen reden om instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen uit te stellen of achterwege te laten.   
3.  Bij het uitvoeren van de preventieve aanpak dienen de Staten 

a. de besluitvorming voor maatregelen voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de visbestanden te verbeteren door zich de beste beschikbare wetenschappelijke informatie te verschaffen en die informatie met elkaar te delen, en door verbeterde technieken toe te passen om risico's en onzekerheden te ondervangen;  

b. de in bijlage II vastgestelde richtlijnen toe te passen en, aan de hand van de beste beschikbare wetenschappelijke informatie, bestandspecifieke referentiewaarden te bepalen en de maatregelen vast te stellen voor het geval die waarden worden overschreden;  

c. onder andere rekening te houden met onzekerheden over de grootte en de produktiviteit van de bestanden, de referentiewaarden, de situatie van een bestand ten opzichte van die referentiewaarden, het niveau en de spreiding van de visserijmortaliteit en het effect van de visserijactiviteit op niet-doelsoorten en verwante of afhankelijke soorten, en voorts met de toestand van de oceaan en het milieu, met de sociaal-economische situatie, alsmede met de voorspellingen dienaangaande;  

d. het verzamelen van gegevens te ontwikkelen en onderzoekprogramma's op te stellen om te evalueren welk effect de visserij heeft op niet-doelsoorten en verwante of afhankelijke soorten, alsmede op hun milieu, en plannen vast te stellen voor het behoud van dergelijke soorten en voor de bescherming van ernstig bedreigde habitats.     
4.  De Staten nemen maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat, wanneer de referentiewaarden bijna zijn bereikt, die waarden niet worden overschreden. Wanneer dat toch het geval is, nemen de Staten onverwijld de in lid 3, onder b, bedoelde maatregelen voor het herstel van de visbestanden.   
5.  Als de situatie van bestanden van doelsoorten of niet-doelsoorten of verwante of afhankelijke soorten reden geeft tot bezorgdheid, zorgen de Staten voor verscherpte monitoring op dergelijke bestanden en soorten met het oog op evaluatie van de situatie daarvan, alsmede van de doeltreffendheid van de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen. Laatstbedoelde maatregelen worden regelmatig aangepast in het licht van nieuwe informatie.   
6.  Voor nieuwe visserijtakken of voor verkennende visserij stellen de Staten zo spoedig mogelijk preventieve instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen vast, waaronder vangst- en visserij-inspanningsbeperkingen. Dergelijke maatregelen blijven van kracht tot er voldoende gegevens zijn voor evaluatie van het effect van de visserij op de duurzaamheid op lange termijn van de betrokken bestanden; vervolgens worden instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen toegepast die op grond van die evaluatie zijn vastgesteld. Deze maatregelen voorzien zo nodig in een geleidelijke ontwikkeling van de visserij.   
7.  Bij een natuurverschijnsel met aanzienlijke negatieve effecten op de situatie van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden nemen de Staten op korte termijn instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat die negatieve effecten niet door de visserij worden verergerd. Dergelijke spoedmaatregelen worden door de Staten ook vastgesteld wanneer de visserij een ernstige bedreiging vormt voor de duurzaamheid van genoemde visbestanden. Spoedmaatregelen zijn tijdelijk en worden gebaseerd op de beste beschikbare wetenschappelijke gegevens.   

### Artikel  7  

####Compatibiliteit van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen

1.  Onverminderd de in het Zeerechtverdrag vastgelegde soevereine rechten van de Kuststaten inzake exploratie, exploitatie, instandhouding en beheer van de levende rijkdommen van de zee in de gebieden onder hun nationale jurisdictie en het overeenkomstig het Zeerechtverdrag voor alle Staten geldende recht om hun onderdanen op de volle zee te laten vissen, 

a. dienen, voor de grensoverschrijdende visbestanden, de betrokken Kuststaten en de Staten waarvan de onderdanen op dergelijke bestanden in de aangrenzende wateren van de volle zee vissen ernaar te streven om rechtstreeks of via de geëigende samenwerkingsvormen als bedoeld in deel III tot overeenstemming te komen over de maatregelen die nodig zijn voor de instandhouding van de betrokken visbestanden in de aangrenzende wateren van de volle zee;  

b. dienen, voor de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden, de betrokken Kuststaten en de Staten waarvan de onderdanen in de regio op dergelijke bestanden vissen rechtstreeks of via de geëigende samenwerkingsvormen als bedoeld in deel III samen te werken om in de hele regio, zowel binnen als buiten de gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie, de betrokken bestanden te behouden en een optimaal gebruik daarvan te bevorderen.     
2.  Met het oog op de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden als totaliteit dienen de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die worden vastgesteld voor de volle zee en dergelijke maatregelen die worden aangenomen voor gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie, compatibel te zijn. Daarom hebben de Kuststaten en de Staten die op de volle zee vissen de plicht om samen te werken en ten aanzien van deze visbestanden compatibele maatregelen vast te stellen. Bij het vaststellen van compatibele maatregelen voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de visbestanden dienen de Staten 

a. rekening te houden met de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die door de Kuststaten overeenkomstig artikel 61 van het Zeerechtverdrag zijn vastgesteld en worden toegepast voor dezelfde visbestanden in de gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie en ervoor te zorgen dat maatregelen die voor die visbestanden in de volle zee worden vastgesteld de doeltreffendheid van de maatregelen van de Kuststaten niet aantasten;  

b. rekening te houden met maatregelen die eerder door de betrokken Kuststaten en op de volle zee vissende Staten overeenkomstig het Zeerechtverdrag voor dezelfde visbestanden zijn vastgesteld en worden toegepast;  

c. rekening te houden met maatregelen die eerder in het kader van organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband overeenkomstig het Zeerechtverdrag voor dezelfde visbestanden zijn vastgesteld en worden toegepast;  

d. rekening te houden met de biologische eenheid die de visbestanden vormen en met andere kenmerken ervan en met de verbanden tussen de verspreiding van de visbestanden in de regio, de daar beoefende takken van visserij en de geografische bijzonderheden van de betrokken regio, met inbegrip van de mate waarin de visbestanden voorkomen en worden bevist in gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie;  

e. rekening te houden met de mate waarin de Kuststaten, respectievelijk de Staten die op de volle zee vissen, afhankelijk zijn van de betrokken visbestanden, en  

f. ervoor te zorgen dat die maatregelen niet schadelijk zijn voor de levende rijkdommen van de zee als totaliteit.     
3.  Bij het uitvoeren van hun plicht tot samenwerking stellen de Staten alles in het werk om binnen een redelijke termijn overeenstemming te bereiken over compatibele instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen.   
4.  Als het niet mogelijk blijkt binnen een redelijke termijn tot overeenstemming te komen, mag elk van de betrokken Staten een beroep doen op de in deel VIII vastgestelde procedures voor de beslechting van geschillen.   
5.  In afwachting van overeenstemming over compatibele instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen stellen de Staten, in een geest van onderling begrip en samenwerking, alles in het werk om tot voorlopige, praktische regelingen te komen. Als overeenstemming over dergelijke regelingen niet mogelijk blijkt, mag elk van de betrokken Staten het geschil, met het oog op voorlopige maatregelen, aan een hof of scheidsgerecht voorleggen overeenkomstig de in deel VIII vastgestelde procedures voor de beslechting van geschillen.   
6.  Bij voorlopige regelingen of maatregelen die worden aanvaard of opgelegd op grond van lid 5 moet rekening worden gehouden met de bepalingen in dit Deel en moet passende aandacht worden gegeven aan de rechten en verplichtingen van alle betrokken Staten; voorts dienen die regelingen of maatregelen uiteindelijke overeenstemming over compatibele instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen niet in gevaar te brengen of te belemmeren en wordt daarmee niet vooruitgelopen op de uiteindelijke uitkomst van een geschillenprocedure.   
7.  De Kuststaten informeren de Staten die op de volle zee in de subregio of regio vissen, rechtstreeks of in het kader van geëigende subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, dan wel op een andere geschikte wijze, over de maatregelen die zij hebben vastgesteld met betrekking tot de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden in de wateren onder hun nationale jurisdictie.   
8.  De Staten die op de volle zee vissen, informeren de andere betrokken Staten, rechtstreeks of in het kader van geëigende subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, dan wel op een andere geschikte wijze, regelmatig over de door hen vastgestelde maatregelen voor regulering van de activiteit van vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren en die op de volle zee op de betrokken bestanden vissen.   

### DEEL  III  

####MECHANISMEN VOOR INTERNATIONALE SAMENWERKING MET BETREKKING TOT DE GRENSOVERSCHRIJDENDE EN DE OVER GROTE AFSTANDEN TREKKENDE VISBESTANDEN

### Artikel  8  

####Samenwerking voor instandhouding en beheer

1.  De Kuststaten en de Staten die op de volle zee vissen, streven, overeenkomstig het Zeerechtverdrag, rechtstreeks of in het kader van geëigende subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer en rekening houdende met de specifieke kenmerken van de subregio of regio, naar samenwerking met betrekking tot de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden met het oog op doeltreffende instandhouding en een doeltreffend beheer van die bestanden.   
2.  De Staten beginnen, met name bij aanwijzingen over mogelijke overbevissing van de betrokken grensoverschrijdende en over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden of bij ontwikkeling van een nieuwe visserij ten opzichte van die visbestanden, onverwijld te goeder trouw overleg. Daartoe kan op verzoek van iedere belanghebbende Staat overleg op gang worden gebracht met het oog op vaststelling van adequate regelingen voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de betrokken visbestanden. In afwachting van overeenstemming houden de Staten zich aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en handelen zij te goeder trouw met passende aandacht voor de rechten, belangen en verplichtingen van andere Staten.   
3.  Wanneer er een organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband bestaat met de bevoegdheid om de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor bepaalde grensoverschrijdende of over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden vast te stellen, komen de Staten die op de volle zee op de betrokken bestanden vissen, en de betrokken Kuststaten hun plicht tot samenwerking na door lid te worden van de betrokken organisatie of partij te worden bij het betrokken akkoord, of door te accepteren om de in het kader van de organisatie of het akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen toe te passen. De Staten met een reëel belang bij de betrokken visserij kunnen lid worden van een dergelijke organisatie of partij worden bij een dergelijk akkoord. De regels voor de deelneming aan een dergelijke organisatie of een dergelijk akkoord mogen de betrokken Staten niet verhinderen lid te worden van zo'n organisatie of partij te worden bij zo'n akkoord; ook mogen die regels niet zo worden toegepast dat wordt gediscrimineerd tegen een Staat of een groep Staten met een reëel belang bij de betrokken visserij.   
4.  Alleen Staten die lid zijn van een dergelijke organisatie of die partij zijn bij een dergelijk akkoord, of die accepteren om de in het kader van een dergelijke organisatie of een dergelijk akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen toe te passen, krijgen toegang tot de visbestanden waarvoor die maatregelen gelden.   
5.  Wanneer er geen organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband bestaat met de bevoegdheid om de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor een bepaald grensoverschrijdend of over grote afstanden trekkend visbestand vast te stellen, werken de betrokken Kuststaten en de Staten die in de betrokken subregio of regio op de volle zee op dat bestand vissen, samen voor de oprichting van een dergelijke organisatie of het aangaan van andere geëigende akkoorden voor de instandhouding en het beheer van een dergelijk visbestand en nemen zij deel aan de werkzaamheden in het kader van deze organisatie of dit akkoord voor visserijbeheer.   
6.  Iedere Staat die voornemens is voor te stellen dat maatregelen worden genomen door een intergouvernementele organisatie die bevoegd is voor de levende rijkdommen van de zee, zorgt, wanneer die maatregelen aanzienlijke effecten zouden hebben voor de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die reeds zijn vastgesteld in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties of akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, via hun instanties voor overleg met de leden van die organisatie of de partijen bij die akkoorden. Voor zover mogelijk gebeurt dat overleg voordat het voorstel bij de intergouvernementele organisatie wordt ingediend.   

### Artikel  9  

####Subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer

1.  Bij de oprichting van subregionale of regionale organisaties en bij het aangaan van subregionale of regionale akkoorden voor het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden dienen de Staten onder andere overeenstemming te bereiken over 

a. de visbestanden waarvoor de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen gelden, daarbij rekening houdende met de biologische kenmerken van de betrokken bestanden en de aard van de betrokken visserij;  

b. het toepassingsgebied, daarbij rekening houdende met artikel 7, lid 1, en de kenmerken van de subregio of regio, waaronder sociaal-economische, geografische en milieutechnische factoren;  

c. de verhouding tussen de werkzaamheden in het kader van de nieuwe organisatie of het nieuwe akkoord en de taak, de doelstellingen en activiteiten in het kader van bestaande organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, en  

d. de wijze waarop in het kader van de organisatie of het akkoord wetenschappelijk advies zal worden verkregen en de situatie van de visbestanden zal worden besproken, waaronder, zo nodig, de oprichting van een wetenschappelijke adviserende instantie.     
2.  De Staten die samenwerken voor de oprichting van een subregionale of regionale organisatie of de totstandbrenging van een subregionaal of regionaal akkoord voor visserijbeheer, geven daarvan kennis aan andere Staten waarvan hun bekend is dat zij een reëel belang hebben bij de werkzaamheden in het kader van de beoogde organisatie of het beoogde akkoord.   

### Artikel  10  

####Uit te voeren taken in het kader van subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer

In het kader van hun plicht tot samenwerking binnen subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer dienen de Staten 

a. tot overeenstemming te komen over en zich te houden aan instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de instandhouding op lange termijn en het duurzaam gebruik van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden;  

b. zo nodig, tot overeenstemming te komen over de rechten van de deelnemers zoals toewijzingen uit toegestane vangsten of niveaus van visserij-inspanning;  

c. algemeen aanbevolen internationale minimumnormen voor een verantwoorde visserij aan te nemen en toe te passen;

m. passende bekendheid te geven aan de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord zijn vastgesteld.    

### Artikel  11  

####Nieuwe leden of partijen

Bij het vaststellen van de aard en de omvang van de rechten van nieuwe leden van of nieuwe partijen bij een organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband dienen de Staten onder andere rekening te houden met 

a. de situatie van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden en het bestaande niveau van visserij-inspanning ten opzichte van die visbestanden;  

b. de belangen, het visserijpatroon en de vismethoden van de nieuwe leden of partijen enerzijds en de oude anderzijds;  

c. de bijdrage van respectievelijk nieuwe en oude leden of partijen aan de instandhouding en het beheer van de betrokken visbestanden, aan het verzamelen en het verstrekken van nauwkeurige gegevens, en aan het wetenschappelijk onderzoek met betrekking tot de visbestanden;  

d. de behoeften van de vissersgemeenschappen in het betrokken kustgebied die in hoofdzaak afhankelijk zijn van de visserij op de betrokken visbestanden;  

e. de behoeften van de Kuststaten waarvan de economie buitengewoon afhankelijk is van de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de zee, en  

f. de belangen van de Ontwikkelingslanden in de subregio of regio, als de betrokken visbestanden ook voorkomen in de gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie van die Staten.    

### Artikel  12  

####Doorzichtigheid van de werkzaamheden in het kader van subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer

1.  De Staten zorgen voor doorzichtigheid van het besluitvormingsproces en de andere werkzaamheden in het kader van subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer.   
2.  Vertegenwoordigers van andere intergouvernementele organisaties en vertegenwoordigers van niet-gouvernementele organisaties die zich bezighouden met de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden krijgen de gelegenheid om, naar gelang van het geval, als waarnemer of in een andere hoedanigheid, aan vergaderingen in het kader van de subregionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer deel te nemen overeenkomstig de voor de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord vastgestelde procedures. Deze procedures mogen op dit punt niet nodeloos restrictief zijn. Deze intergouvernementele organisaties en niet-gouvernementele organisaties krijgen tijdig toegang tot de verslagen en rapporten in verband met de werkzaamheden in het kader van deze organisaties en akkoorden, een en ander onverminderd de procedurebepalingen inzake de toegang tot die stukken.   

### Artikel  13  

####Versterking van bestaande organisaties en akkoorden

De Staten werken samen voor versterking van bestaande subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer om hun instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de grensoverschrijdende en over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden doeltreffender te kunnen vaststellen en uitvoeren.  

### Artikel  14  

####Verzamelen en verstrekken van gegevens en samenwerking bij wetenschappelijk onderzoek

1.  De Staten zorgen ervoor dat de vissersvaartuigen die hun vlag voeren hun de gegevens verstrekken die zij nodig hebben om de uit deze Overeenkomst voortvloeiende verplichtingen na te komen. Daartoe nemen de Staten overeenkomstig bijlage I de volgende maatregelen: 

a. zij verzamelen wetenschappelijke, technische en statistische gegevens over de visserij op de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden en wisselen die gegevens met elkaar uit;  

b. zij zorgen ervoor dat de gegevens gedetailleerd genoeg worden verzameld om doeltreffende evaluatie van de betrokken visbestanden te vergemakkelijken en dat ze tijdig genoeg worden verstrekt met het oog op de behoeften in het kader van de subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, en  

c. zij nemen de nodige maatregelen om de juistheid van die gegevens te verifiëren.     
2.  De Staten dienen, rechtstreeks of in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, 

a. tot overeenstemming te komen over de specifieke gegevens die voor de werkzaamheden in het kader van die organisaties en akkoorden moeten worden verstrekt en het formaat waarin dat moet gebeuren, daarbij rekening houdende met de aard van de betrokken visbestanden en van de visserij daarop;  

b. analysetechnieken en methoden voor bestandsevaluatie te ontwikkelen en met de andere partijen te delen, teneinde de maatregelen voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden te verbeteren.     
3.  In overeenstemming met Deel XIII van het Zeerechtverdrag werken de Staten, rechtstreeks of in het kader van bevoegde internationale organisaties, samen voor versterking van de mogelijkheden voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek op visserijgebied en voor bevordering van wetenschappelijk onderzoek met betrekking tot de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden dat wordt uitgevoerd in het algemeen belang. Daartoe bevorderen Staten of bevoegde internationale organisaties die dergelijk onderzoek uitvoeren buiten de gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie, actief dat de uitkomsten van dat onderzoek en de gegevens over de doelstellingen en methoden worden bekendgemaakt aan en verspreid in alle belanghebbende Staten en vergemakkelijken zij, in de mate van het mogelijke, deelneming van wetenschapsmensen uit de belanghebbende Staten aan dat onderzoek.   

### Artikel  15  

####Ingesloten of half-ingesloten zeeën

Bij toepassing van deze Overeenkomst in een ingesloten of half-ingesloten zee houden de Staten rekening met de natuurlijke kenmerken van die zee en handelen zij in overeenstemming met Deel IX van het Zeerechtverdrag en de andere relevante bepalingen daarvan.  

### Artikel  16  

####Gebieden van de volle zee die volledig omgeven zijn door een gebied onder de nationale jurisdictie van een enkele Staat

1.  De Staten die op grensoverschrijdende en over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden vissen in een gebied van de volle zee dat volledig omgeven is door een gebied onder de nationale jurisdictie van een enkele Staat, en laatstbedoelde Staat werken samen voor de vaststelling van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de betrokken visbestanden in de volle zee. Rekening houdende met de natuurlijke kenmerken van het gebied en in overeenstemming met artikel 7 geven de Staten bijzondere aandacht aan compatibele instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de betrokken visbestanden. Bij de vaststelling van de maatregelen voor de volle zee wordt rekening gehouden met de rechten, plichten en belangen van de kuststaat op grond van het Zeerechtverdrag, met de beste beschikbare wetenschappelijke gegevens, en met de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die de Kuststaat overeenkomstig artikel 61 van het Zeerechtverdrag heeft aangenomen en toepast voor dezelfde visbestanden in het gebied onder zijn nationale jurisdictie. De Staten komen ook maatregelen overeen inzake monitoring, controle, toezicht en rechtshandhaving om de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de volle zee te doen naleven.   
2.  Overeenkomstig artikel 8 handelen de Staten te goeder trouw en stellen zij alles in het werk om onverwijld tot overeenstemming te komen over de bij de visserij in het in lid 1 bedoelde gebied toe te passen instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen. Als de betrokken vissende Staten en de kuststaat niet binnen een redelijke termijn tot overeenstemming kunnen komen over die maatregelen, passen zij, rekening houdende met lid 1, bepaalde in artikel 7, leden 4, 5 en 6, inzake voorlopige regelingen of maatregelen toe. In afwachting van die voorlopige regelingen of maatregelen nemen de betrokken Staten ten aanzien van de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat ze geen visserijactiviteiten uitvoeren die schadelijk zijn voor de betrokken visbestanden.   

### DEEL  IV  

####STATEN DIE GEEN LID, NOCH PARTIJ ZIJN

### Artikel  17  

####Staten die geen lid van een organisatie, noch partij bij een akkoord voor visserijbeheer zijn

1.  Een Staat die geen lid is van of geen partij is bij een organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband of die niet op andere wijze accepteert om de in het kader van een dergelijke organisatie of een dergelijk akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen toe te passen, is daarmee niet ontslagen van de plicht om, in overeenstemming met het Zeerechtverdrag en deze Overeenkomst, mee te werken bij de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden.   
2.  Een dergelijke Staat geeft de vaartuigen die zijn vlag voeren geen toestemming om te vissen op grensoverschrijdende of over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden waarvoor in het kader van een dergelijke organisatie of een dergelijk akkoord instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen zijn vastgesteld.   
3.  De Staten die lid zijn van of partij zijn bij een organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband vragen, individueel of samen, de in artikel 1, lid 3, bedoelde lichamen waarvan vissersvaartuigen in het betrokken gebied vissen, om hun volledige medewerking in de vorm van toepassing van de in het kader van die organisatie of dat akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, teneinde te bereiken dat die maatregelen de facto op zo ruim mogelijke schaal in het betrokken gebied worden toegepast. Bedoelde lichamen delen in de visserij in verhouding tot hun inzet voor de naleving van de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de betrokken visbestanden.   
4.  De Staten die lid zijn van of partij zijn bij een dergelijke organisatie of een dergelijk akkoord wisselen gegevens uit over de visserijactiviteit van vissersvaartuigen die de vlag voeren van Staten die geen lid van de organisatie, noch partij bij het akkoord zijn, maar toch op de betrokken visbestanden vissen. Om dergelijke vissersvaartuigen te weerhouden van activiteiten die de efficiëntie aantasten van de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die in het kader van de organisatie of het akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband zijn vastgesteld, nemen zij maatregelen die in overeenstemming zijn met deze Overeenkomst en met het internationale recht.   

### DEEL  V  

####PLICHTEN VAN DE VLAGGESTAAT

### Artikel  18  

####Plichten van de Vlaggestaat

1.  De Staten waarvan de vaartuigen op de volle zee vissen, nemen de nodige maatregelen opdat de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren de in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen naleven en geen activiteiten uitvoeren die de efficiëntie van bedoelde maatregelen aantasten.   
2.  De Staten geven alleen toestemming om vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren, te gebruiken voor de visserij op de volle zee, als zij daadwerkelijk in staat zijn om hun op grond van het Zeerechtverdrag en van deze Overeenkomst geldende verantwoordelijkheden met betrekking tot die vaartuigen na te komen.   
3.  De Staten nemen met betrekking tot de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren onder andere de volgende maatregelen: 

a. zij controleren vaartuigen die op de volle zee vissen via vergunningen overeenkomstig de toepasselijke in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband vastgestelde procedures;  

b. zij stellen reglementen vast 

i. waarin voor de vergunning zodanige voorwaarden worden bepaald dat zij hun verplichtingen in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband kunnen nakomen,  

ii. waarin het vissen op de volle zee met vaartuigen zonder deugdelijke vergunning of op een wijze die niet in overeenstemming is met de voorwaarden voor de vergunning, wordt verboden,  

iii. waarin wordt bepaald dat de vergunning steeds aan boord dient te zijn van de vaartuigen die op de volle zee vissen en op verzoek voor inspectie moet worden getoond aan een naar behoren gemachtigde persoon, en  

iv. om ervoor te zorgen dat de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren niet zonder toestemming vissen in gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie van andere Staten;    

c. zij stellen een nationaal register op van vissersvaartuigen die op de volle zee mogen vissen en bepalen dat rechtstreeks belanghebbende Staten op verzoek toegang hebben tot de informatie in dat register, rekening houdende met de nationale wetgeving van de Vlaggestaat over het verstrekken van die informatie;  

d. zij stellen, met het oog op identificatie, voorschriften inzake de kentekens van vissersvaartuigen en vistuig vast die in overeenstemming zijn met uniforme en internationaal erkende systemen, zoals de „Standard Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels" van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties;  

e. zij stellen voorschriften vast inzake registratie en tijdige melding van de positie van de vissersvaartuigen, de vangst van doelsoorten en niet-doelsoorten, de visserij-inspanning en andere relevante gegevens over de visserij, een en ander in overeenstemming met subregionale, regionale of mondiale normen voor het verzamelen van dergelijke gegevens;  

f. zij stellen voorschriften vast voor de controle op de vangst van doelsoorten en niet-doelsoorten, via maatregelen zoals waarnemersprogramma's, inspectieregelingen, losbewijzen, toezicht op overlading, monitoring van de aanvoer, en statistieken over de markt;  

g. zij zorgen voor monitoring, controle en toezicht op de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren, op hun visserij-activiteit en op de daarmee verband houdende activiteiten, onder andere via 

i. de toepassing van nationale inspectieregelingen en van subregionale en regionale samenwerkingsvormen voor rechtshandhaving op grond van de artikelen 21 en 22, met onder andere bepalingen dat die vaartuigen naar behoren gemachtigde inspecteurs van andere Staten aan boord laten,  

ii. de toepassing van nationale waarnemersprogramma's en subregionale of regionale waarnemersprogramma's waaraan de Vlaggestaat deelneemt, met onder andere bepalingen dat die vaartuigen waarnemers van andere Staten aan boord laten om de in het kader van de programma's overeengekomen taken uit te voeren, en  

iii. de ontwikkeling en toepassing van systemen voor monitoring van vaartuigen, waaronder, zo nodig, satellietvolgsystemen, in het kader van nationale programma's en in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband tussen de betrokken Staten overeengekomen programma's;    

h. zij stellen voorschriften vast voor het overladen op volle zee, teneinde ervoor te zorgen dat de efficiëncy van de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen niet wordt aangetast, en  

i. zij stellen visserijvoorschriften vast teneinde ervoor te zorgen dat in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband vastgestelde maatregelen, waaronder die om de vangst van niet-doelsoorten zoveel mogelijk te beperken, worden nageleefd.     
4.  Wanneer een in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband overeengekomen regeling voor monitoring, controle en toezicht geldt, stellen de Staten voor de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren maatregelen vast die compatibel zijn met die regeling.   

### DEEL  VI  

####NALEVING VAN DE BEPALINGEN EN RECHTSHANDHAVING

### Artikel  19  

####Naleving van de bepalingen en rechtshandhaving door de Vlaggestaat

1.  De Staten zorgen ervoor dat de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren de in subregionaal of regionaal verband vastgestelde maatregelen voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden naleven. Daartoe nemen de Staten de volgende maatregelen: 

a. zij zorgen voor rechtshandhaving, ongeacht de plaats van de overtreding;  

b. zij zorgen voor een onmiddellijk en grondig onderzoek, dat fysieke inspectie van de betrokken vaartuigen kan omvatten, van beweerde overtredingen van in subregionaal of regionaal verband vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen en rapporteren de Staat die de beweerde overtreding meldt en de instanties van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord in subregionaal of regionaal verband onverwijld over de voortgang en de resultaten van het onderzoek;  

c. zij verplichten alle vissersvaartuigen die hun vlag voeren om de onderzoeksautoriteiten gegevens te verstrekken over de positie van het vaartuig, de vangsten, het vistuig, de visserij en de daarmee verband houdende activiteiten in het gebied waar er een overtreding zou zijn geweest;  

d. zij geven, wanneer zij ervan overtuigd zijn dat voldoende bewijsmateriaal beschikbaar is met betrekking tot een beweerde overtreding, de zaak door aan hun autoriteiten teneinde onverwijld te komen tot een gerechtelijke actie overeenkomstig hun wetten en leggen, zo nodig, het vaartuig aan de ketting, en  

e. zij zorgen ervoor dat, wanneer overeenkomstig hun wetten is vastgesteld dat een vaartuig betrokken is geweest bij een ernstige overtreding van deze maatregelen, het betrokken vaartuig de visserij op de volle zee niet hervat voordat alle door de Vlaggestaat voor die overtreding opgelegde sancties zijn uitgevoerd.     
2.  Alle onderzoeken en gerechtelijke acties moeten snel worden uitgevoerd. Sancties voor overtredingen moeten voldoende streng zijn om ervoor te zorgen dat de maatregelen worden nageleefd en om de betrokkenen te weerhouden van overtredingen, waar dan ook, en moeten voorts meebrengen dat de overtreders de winst uit hun onwettige activiteiten wordt ontnomen. De maatregelen ten aanzien van kapiteins en andere officieren van vissersvaartuigen dienen bepalingen te omvatten op grond waarvan onder andere vergunningen om op die vaartuigen in die functies te werken, kunnen worden geweigerd, ingetrokken of geschorst.   

### Artikel  20  

####Internationale samenwerking bij rechtshandhaving

1.  De Staten werken rechtstreeks of in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer samen om ervoor te zorgen dat in dat kader vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden worden nageleefd en in rechte worden gehandhaafd.   
2.  De Vlaggestaten die een onderzoek uitvoeren met betrekking tot een beweerde overtreding van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor grensoverschrijdende en over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden mogen assistentie vragen van andere Staten waarvan de medewerking dienstig kan zijn voor dat onderzoek. De Staten streven ernaar om aan redelijke verzoeken van de Vlaggestaten in verband met dergelijke onderzoeken te voldoen.   
3.  Zo'n onderzoek mag door de Vlaggestaten rechtstreeks, in samenwerking met andere belanghebbende Staten of in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband, worden uitgevoerd. Aan alle Staten die belang hebben bij of nadeel ondervinden van een beweerde overtreding, wordt informatie verstrekt over de voortgang en het resultaat van het onderzoek.   
4.  De Staten assisteren elkaar voor het identificeren van de vaartuigen waarvan activiteiten zijn gemeld die de efficiëntie aantasten van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband zijn vastgesteld.   
5.  De Staten treffen, voor zover volgens nationale wet- of regelgeving toegestaan, regelingen om bewijsmateriaal met betrekking tot beweerde overtredingen van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen beschikbaar te stellen aan de vervolgende autoriteiten van andere Staten.   
6.  Wanneer er acceptabele redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een vaartuig dat zich op de volle zee bevindt, zonder toestemming in een gebied onder jurisdictie van een Kuststaat heeft gevist, wordt, op verzoek van de betrokken kuststaat, zulks door de vlaggestaat van dat vaartuig onmiddellijk grondig onderzocht. De Vlaggestaat werkt in dergelijke gevallen met de Kuststaat samen om te komen tot adequate rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen en kan de betrokken autoriteiten van de Kuststaat toestaan het vaartuig op de volle zee aan te houden en te inspecteren. Het bepaalde in dit lid laat onverlet het bepaalde in artikel 111 van het Zeerechtverdrag.   
7.  De Staten die lid zijn van of partij zijn bij een organisatie of een akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband mogen, overeenkomstig het internationale recht, waaronder de daartoe in subregionaal of regionaal verband vastgestelde procedures, totdat de Vlaggestaat passende maatregelen treft, maatregelen nemen om vaartuigen waarvan de activiteiten de efficiëncy van de in het kader van die organisatie of dat akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen aantasten of op enige andere wijze een overtreding daarvan inhouden, ervan te weerhouden om in de volle zee in de subregio of regio te vissen.   

### Artikel  21  

####Subregionale en regionale samenwerking bij rechtshandhaving

1.  De Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst en tevens lid zijn van of partij zijn bij een organisatie of een akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal verband, mogen in alle gebieden van de volle zee die daaronder vallen hun naar behoren gemachtigde inspecteurs, overeenkomstig lid 2, vissersvaartuigen die de vlag voeren van een andere Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, laten aanhouden en laten inspecteren, ongeacht of zo'n Staat ook lid is van de betrokken organisatie of partij is bij het betrokken akkoord, teneinde ervoor te zorgen dat de in het kader van die organisatie of dat akkoord vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden worden nageleefd.   
2.  De Staten stellen in het kader van de subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer procedures vast voor het aanhouden en de inspectie op grond van lid 1, alsmede voor de toepassing van de andere bepalingen van dit artikel. Deze procedures dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met dit artikel en de basisprocedures van artikel 22 en mogen geen discriminatie inhouden ten opzichte van niet-leden van de organisatie of niet-partijen bij het akkoord voor het visserijbeheer. De aanhouding en de inspectie, alsmede eventuele volgende rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen worden uitgevoerd volgens die procedures. De Staten geven passende bekendheid aan de krachtens het bepaalde in dit lid vastgestelde procedures.   
3.  Als het niet mogelijk is om binnen twee jaar na aanvaarding van deze Overeenkomst bedoelde procedures in het kader van een organisatie of een akkoord vast te stellen, gelden voor de aanhouding en de inspectie op grond van lid 1, alsmede voor eventuele volgende rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen, in afwachting van de vaststelling van dergelijke procedures, de bepalingen van dit artikel en de in artikel 22 vastgestelde basisprocedures.   
4.  De inspecterende Staten stellen, voordat zij acties ondernemen op grond van dit artikel, alle Staten waarvan vaartuigen op de volle zee in de betrokken subregio of regio vissen, rechtstreeks of in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband op de hoogte van het identificatiedocument dat zij aan hun naar behoren gemachtigde inspecteurs verstrekken. De vaartuigen die worden gebruikt voor de aanhouding en de inspectie moeten voorzien zijn van duidelijke kentekens en herkend kunnen worden als vaartuigen in overheidsdienst. Bij toetreding tot deze Overeenkomst wijzen de Staten een adequate autoriteit aan voor melding van kennisgevingen op grond van dit artikel en geven zij daaraan passende bekendheid in het kader van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties of akkoorden voor visserijbeheer.   
5.  Wanneer er, na de aanhouding en de inspectie, gegronde redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een vaartuig in strijd heeft gehandeld met de in lid 1 bedoelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, dient de inspecterende Staat, zo nodig, het bewijsmateriaal veilig te stellen en de Vlaggestaat onverwijld in kennis te stellen van de beweerde overtreding.   
6.  Na ontvangst van een kennisgeving als bedoeld in lid 5 reageert de Vlaggestaat binnen drie dagen of binnen de reactietermijn die is bepaald in de overeenkomstig lid 2 vastgestelde procedures en 

a. komt hij, onverwijld, zijn verplichtingen op grond van artikel 19 na om een onderzoek uit te voeren en, als de bewijzen daar aanleiding toe geven, rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen ten aanzien van het vaartuig te nemen, in welk geval hij de inspecterende Staat onverwijld in kennis stelt van de resultaten van het onderzoek en van de rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen die zijn genomen, of  

b. geeft hij de inspecterende Staat toestemming om een onderzoek uit te voeren.     
7.  Wanneer de Vlaggestaat de inspecterende Staat toestemming geeft om onderzoek uit te voeren met betrekking tot een beweerde overtreding, deelt de inspecterende Staat de resultaten van dat onderzoek onverwijld aan de Vlaggestaat mee. De Vlaggestaat komt, als de bewijzen daar aanleiding toe geven, zijn verplichtingen na om rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen ten aanzien van het vaartuig te nemen. De Vlaggestaat mag echter ook de inspecterende Staat toestemming geven om ten aanzien van het vaartuig de rechtshandhavingsmaatregelen te treffen die de Vlaggestaat mag aangeven in overeenstemming met zijn rechten en verplichtingen op grond van deze Overeenkomst.   
8.  Wanneer er, na aanhouding en inspectie, gegronde redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een vaartuig een ernstige overtreding heeft begaan en de vlaggestaat niet heeft gereageerd of niet de op grond van lid 6 of lid 7 voorgeschreven maatregelen heeft genomen, mogen de inspecteurs aan boord blijven en het bewijsmateriaal veilig stellen en de kapitein om assistentie vragen voor verder onderzoek, wat, zo nodig, ook kan inhouden dat het vaartuig onverwijld naar de dichtstbijgelegen geschikte haven of een andere in de overeenkomstig lid 2 vastgestelde procedures bepaalde haven wordt gebracht. De inspecterende Staat stelt de Vlaggestaat onmiddellijk in kennis van de haven waarnaar het vaartuig zich dient te begeven. De inspecterende Staat en de Vlaggestaat en, zo nodig, de havenstaat nemen alle nodige maatregelen voor het welzijn van de leden van de bemanning, ongeacht hun nationaliteit.   
9.  De inspecterende Staat informeert de Vlaggestaat en de betrokken organisatie of de partijen bij het betrokken akkoord over de uitkomsten van eventueel verder onderzoek.   
10.  De inspecterende Staat geeft zijn inspecteurs opdracht om zich te houden aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels, procedures en praktijken voor de veiligheid van vaartuig en bemanning, om het vissen zo min mogelijk te verstoren en om, voor zover mogelijk, maatregelen die de kwaliteit van de vangst aan boord aantasten, te vermijden. De inspecterende Staat zorgt ervoor dat de aanhouding en de inspectie van vissersvaartuigen niet worden uitgevoerd op een wijze die als lastigvallen wordt ervaren.   
11.  In dit artikel wordt onder ernstige overtreding verstaan: 

a. het vissen zonder een geldige door de Vlaggestaat overeenkomstig artikel 18, lid 3, onder a, afgegeven vergunning;  

b. nalatigheid wat betreft nauwkeurige registratie van de vangsten en de daarmee verband houdende gegevens zoals voorgeschreven is in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband, of een aanzienlijk te lage registratie van de vangst in strijd met de vangstregistratiebepalingen in het kader van zo'n organisatie of zo'n akkoord;  

c. het vissen in een gesloten gebied, tijdens een gesloten seizoen of zonder een quotum, of nadat het quotum is bereikt dat in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband is vastgesteld;  

d. gerichte visserij op een visbestand waarvoor een moratorium op de visserij of een visserijverbod is vastgesteld;  

e. het gebruik van verboden vistuig;  

f. het vervalsen of aan het zicht onttrekken van kentekens, identificatietekens of registratieletters en -nummers van het vissersvaartuig;  

g. het verbergen, het beschadigen of het laden verdwijnen van bewijsmateriaal met betrekking tot een onderzoek;  

h. meerdere overtredingen die samen neerkomen op ernstige veronachtzaming van de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, en  

i. andere overtredingen die als zodanig zijn aangeduid in de procedures die zijn vastgesteld in het kader van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer.     
12.  Ongeacht de overige bepalingen van dit artikel mag de vlaggestaat op elk ogenblik maatregelen nemen om met betrekking tot een beweerde overtreding zijn verplichtingen op grond van artikel 19 na te komen. Wanneer het vaartuig zich onder het gezag van de inspecterende Staat bevindt, wordt, op verzoek van de vlaggestaat, dat vaartuig door de inspecterende Staat vrijgegeven aan de vlaggestaat met gelijktijdige verstrekking van volledige informatie over de stand en de uitkomsten van het uitgevoerde onderzoek.   
13.  Dit artikel laat onverlet het recht van de vlaggestaat om maatregelen te nemen overeenkomstig zijn wetten, inclusief vervolging met het oog op sancties.   
14.  Dit artikel is mutatis mutandis van toepassing op aanhouding en inspectie door een Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst en die tevens lid is van of partij is bij een organisatie of een akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband en die gegronde redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat een vissersvaartuig dat de vlag voert van een andere Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, in het gebied van de volle zee dat onder deze organisatie of dat akkoord valt in strijd heeft gehandeld met in lid 1 bedoelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, wanneer dat vaartuig vervolgens tijdens dezelfde visreis een gebied onder de nationale jurisdictie van de inspecterende Staat is binnengevaren.   
15.  Wanneer in het kader van een organisatie of een akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband een andere structuur is opgezet die namens de leden of partijen effectief uitvoering geeft aan hun op grond van deze Overeenkomst geldende verplichting om te zorgen voor naleving van de in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, kunnen leden van zo'n organisatie of partijen bij zo'n akkoord overeenkomen om, wat betreft de instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die zij hebben vastgesteld voor het relevante gebied van de volle zee, het bepaalde in artikel 1 slechts ten opzichte van elkaar toe te passen.   
16.  Het optreden van andere Staten dan de vlaggestaat ten opzichte van vaartuigen die in strijd hebben gehandeld met de in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer vastgestelde instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen, dient evenredig te zijn met de ernst van de overtreding.   
17.  Wanneer er acceptabele redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een vissersvaartuig op de volle zee statenloos is, mag een Staat dat vaartuig aanhouden en het inspecteren. Als de bewijzen daar aanleiding toe geven, mag die Staat overeenkomstig het internationale recht passende maatregelen nemen.   
18.  De Staten zijn aansprakelijk voor schade of verliezen als gevolg van optreden op grond van dit artikel, wanneer dat optreden onwettig is of verder gaat dan, gezien de beschikbare informatie, redelijkerwijs nodig is voor toepassing van de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  22  

####Basisprocedures voor aanhouding en inspectie op grond van artikel 21

1.  De inspecterende Staat zorgt ervoor dat zijn naar behoren gemachtigde inspecteurs 

a. de kapitein van het vaartuig hun identificatiedocument laten zien, alsmede een exemplaar van de tekst van de betrokken instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen of van de op grond van deze maatregelen voor het betrokken gebied van de volle zee geldende regels of reglementen;  

b. de vlaggestaat op het ogenblik van de aanhouding en inspectie een kennisgeving zenden;  

c. tijdens de aanhouding en inspectie de kapitein niet beletten contact te hebben met de autoriteiten van de Vlaggestaat;  

d. de kapitein en de autoriteiten van de Vlaggestaat een kopie van het rapport over de aanhouding en inspectie verstrekken en daarin alle bezwaren of verklaringen noteren die de kapitein wenst te maken;  

e. het vaartuig na afronding van de inspectie onverwijld verlaten, als zij geen bewijzen van ernstige overtredingen vinden;  

f. het gebruik van geweld vermijden, tenzij wanneer en in de mate waarin dat nodig is voor de veiligheid van de inspecteurs en wanneer deze worden gehinderd bij de uitoefening van hun taak. De mate van geweld dient niet groter te zijn dan redelijkerwijs nodig is in de gegeven situatie.     
2.  De naar behoren gemachtigde inspecteurs van een inspecterende Staat hebben de bevoegdheid om het vaartuig, de vergunning, het vistuig, de installaties, de administratie, de apparatuur, de vis en visserijprodukten te inspecteren, alsmede alle documenten die relevant zijn om na te gaan of de betrokken instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen zijn nageleefd.   
3.  De Vlaggestaat zorgt ervoor dat de kapiteins van de vaartuigen 

a. het snel en veilig aan boord gaan van de inspecteurs accepteren en vergemakkelijken;  

b. meewerken aan en assistentie verlenen voor inspectie van het vaartuig volgens deze procedures;  

c. de inspecteurs niet tegenwerken, intimideren of hinderen bij de uitoefening van hun taak;  

d. tijdens de aanhouding en inspectie de inspecteurs niet beletten contact te hebben met de autoriteiten van de Vlaggestaat;  

e. de inspecteurs redelijke faciliteiten verschaffen, waaronder, zo nodig, voedsel en een verblijfsruimte, en  

f. het van boord gaan van de inspecteurs vergemakkelijken.     
4.  Voor het geval de kapitein van een vaartuig aanhouding en inspectie overeenkomstig dit artikel en artikel 21 weigert, geeft de vlaggestaat, behalve in omstandigheden waarin het volgens algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels, procedures en praktijken voor de veiligheid op zee nodig is de aanhouding en inspectie uit te stellen, de kapitein van het vaartuig bevel om onmiddellijk aanhouding en inspectie te accepteren en schorst die Staat, als de kapitein dat bevel niet opvolgt, de visvergunning van het betrokken vaartuig en geeft hij dat vaartuig het bevel onmiddellijk naar de haven terug te keren. Wanneer de in dit lid bedoelde omstandigheden zich voordoen, deelt de vlaggestaat de inspecterende Staat mee welke maatregelen hij genomen heeft.   

### Artikel  23  

####Maatregelen van een Havenstaat

1.  Een Havenstaat heeft het recht en de plicht om, overeenkomstig het internationale recht, maatregelen te nemen om de efficiëncy te bevorderen van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen die in subregional, regionaal of mondiaal verband zijn vastgesteld. Daarbij maakt de Havenstaat noch naar de vorm, noch in feite onderscheid ten aanzien van de vaartuigen van welke Staat ook.   
2.  Een Havenstaat mag onder andere documenten, vistuig en vangst aan boord van vissersvaartuigen inspecteren, wanneer die vaartuigen zich vrijwillig in zijn havens of bij offshore terminals bevinden.   
3.  De Staten mogen reglementen vaststellen op grond waarvan de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten aanvoer en overlading mogen verbieden, wanneer vaststaat dat de vangst is behaald op een wijze die de efficiëncy aantast van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de volle zee die in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband zijn vastgesteld.   
4.  Dit artikel laat onverlet de overeenkomstig het internationale recht geldende soevereiniteit van de Staten over de havens op hun grondgebied.   

### DEEL  VII  

####BIJZONDERE OMSTANDIGHEDEN VAN ONTWIKKELINGSLANDEN

### Artikel  24  

####Erkenning van de bijzondere omstandigheden van ontwikkelingslanden

1.  De Staten houden ten volle rekening met de bijzondere omstandigheden van de Ontwikkelingslanden wat betreft de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden en de ontwikkeling van de visserij op die bestanden. Daartoe verlenen de Staten bijstand aan de Ontwikkelingslanden hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via het ontwikkelingsprogramma van de Verenigde Naties (UNDP), de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie (FAO) van de Verenigde Naties en andere speciale bureaus, de Mondiale Milieufaciliteit (GEF), de Commissie Duurzame Ontwikkeling, en andere internationale en regionale organisaties en lichamen.   
2.  Bij het nakomen van hun plicht tot samenwerking voor het vaststellen van instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen voor de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden houden de Staten rekening met de bijzondere omstandigheden van Ontwikkelingslanden, en met name met 

a. de kwetsbaarheid van de Ontwikkelingslanden die afhankelijk zijn van de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de zee, ook voor de voedselvoorziening van hun bevolking of een gedeelte daarvan,  

b. de noodzaak om negatieve effecten te voorkomen voor de visserij door zelfvoorzieningsvissers, kleinschalige en ambachtelijke vissers, vrouwen in de visserijsector en de inheemse bevolking in de Ontwikkelingslanden, en om al deze betrokkenen in die landen toegang tot de visserij te waarborgen, een en ander met name voor kleine eilanden die Ontwikkelingslanden zijn, en  

c. de noodzaak om ervoor te zorgen dat deze maatregelen er niet toe leiden dat, direct of indirect, de lasten van de instandhoudingsmaatregelen onevenredig voor rekening komen van de Ontwikkelingslanden.     

### Artikel  25  

####Vormen van samenwerking met ontwikkelingslanden

1.  De Staten werken rechtstreeks of in het kader van subregionale, regionale of mondiale organisaties samen om 

a. de mogelijkheden van de Ontwikkelingslanden, en met name de minst ontwikkelde en de Ontwikkelingslanden die kleine eilanden zijn, op het gebied van de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden te vergroten en hun eigen visserij op die bestanden te ontwikkelen;  

b. Ontwikkelingslanden, en met name de minst ontwikkelde en de Ontwikkelingslanden die kleine eilanden zijn, in staat te stellen deel te nemen aan de visserij op de betrokken bestanden op de volle zee, ook door hun de toegang tot die bestanden te vergemakkelijken, evenwel onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in de artikelen 5 en 11, en  

c. de deelneming van Ontwikkelingslanden aan subregionale en regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer te vergemakkelijken.     
2.  Samenwerking met de Ontwikkelingslanden voor de in dit artikel aangegeven doelstellingen omvat financiële bijstand, bijstand voor betere opleidingen, technische bijstand, overdracht van technologie, met inbegrip van joint ventures, en adviezen.   
3.  De bijstand wordt onder andere specifiek gericht op 

a. verbetering van de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden via het verzamelen, rapporteren, verifiëren, uitwisselen en analyseren van gegevens over de visserij en daarmee verband houdende gegevens;  

b. evaluatie van de visbestanden en wetenschappelijk onderzoek, en  

c. monitoring, controle, toezicht en rechtshandhaving, met inbegrip van opleiding en van vergroting van de eigen plaatselijke mogelijkheden, opstellen en ondersteuning van nationale en regionale waarnemersprogramma's, en toegang tot technologie en apparatuur.     

### Artikel  26  

####Speciale bijstand voor de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst

1.  De Staten werken samen voor de oprichting van speciale fondsen om de Ontwikkelingslanden bijstand te verlenen bij de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst en ook voor de kosten van procedures voor de beslechting van geschillen waarbij zij Partij zijn.   
2.  De Staten en de internationale organisaties helpen de Ontwikkelingslanden bij de totstandbrenging van nieuwe of de versterking van bestaande subregionale of regionale organisaties of akkoorden voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden.   

### DEEL  VIII  

####VREEDZAME BESLECHTING VAN GESCHILLEN

### Artikel  27  

####Verplichting geschillen langs vreedzame weg te beslechten

De Staten zijn verplicht hun geschillen te beslechten via onderhandelingen, feitenonderzoek, bemiddeling, conciliatie, arbitrage, een rechterlijke beslissing, een beroep op regionale organen of akkoorden, of andere vreedzame middelen naar hun eigen keuze.  

### Artikel  28  

####Voorkomen van geschillen

De Staten werken samen om geschillen te voorkomen. Daartoe komen de Staten in het kader van de organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband efficiënte en snelle besluitvormingsprocedures overeen en worden bestaande besluitvormingsprocedures zo nodig verbeterd.  

### Artikel  29  

####Technische geschillen

Bij geschillen over aangelegenheden van technische aard kunnen de Staten het geschil voorleggen aan een door hen ad hoc uit deskundigen samengesteld scheidsgerecht. Dit scheidsgerecht spreekt met de betrokken Staten en tracht het geschil snel op te lossen zonder bindende procedures voor geschillenbeslechting te volgen.  

### Artikel  30  

####Procedures voor geschillenbeslechting

1.  De in deel XV van het Zeerechtverdrag vastgestelde bepalingen voor geschillenbeslechting zijn mutatis mutandis van toepassing op geschillen over de interpretatie of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst tussen de Staten die daarbij partij zijn, ongeacht of die Staten ook Partij zijn bij het Zeerechtverdrag.   
2.  De in Deel XV van het Zeerechtverdrag vastgestelde bepalingen voor geschillenbeslechting zijn mutatis mutandis van toepassing op geschillen tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, welke betrekking hebben op de interpretatie of de toepassing van een visserijovereenkomst in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband over grensoverschrijdende of over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden waarbij zij Partij zijn, inclusief geschillen over de instandhouding en het beheer van dergelijke visbestanden, ongeacht of die Staten ook Partij zijn bij het Zeerechtverdrag.   
3.  De procedure voor geschillenbeslechting die een Staat die Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst en bij het Zeerechtverdrag, overeenkomstig artikel 287 van dat verdrag heeft aanvaard, is van toepassing voor de beslechting van geschillen krachtens het bepaalde in dit Deel, tenzij de betrokken Staat bij de ondertekening of bekrachtiging van of de toetreding tot deze Overeenkomst of op enig tijdstip daarna overeenkomstig genoemd artikel 287 een andere procedure heeft aanvaard.   
4.  Een Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, maar die geen Partij is bij het Zeerechtverdrag, is vrij om bij de ondertekening of bekrachtiging van of de toetreding tot deze Overeenkomst of op enig tijdstip daarna door middel van een schriftelijke verklaring voor de beslechting van de in dit deel bedoelde geschillen een of meer van de in artikel 287, lid 1, van het Zeerechtverdrag genoemde wijzen van regeling van geschillen te kiezen. Artikel 287 is van toepassing voor bedoelde verklaring en voor elk geschil waarbij een dergelijke Staat Partij is, maar dat niet onder een van kracht zijnde verklaring valt. Met het oog op conciliatie en arbitrage overeenkomstig de Bijlagen V, VII en VIII bij het Zeerechtverdrag heeft een dergelijke Staat het recht om voor de beslechting van geschillen krachtens het bepaalde in dit deel conciliatoren, scheidsmannen en deskundigen aan te wijzen voor opneming in de lijsten waarvan sprake is in Bijlage V, artikel 2, Bijlage VII, artikel 2, en Bijlage VIII, artikel 2, van laatstgenoemd verdrag.   
5.  Een hof- of scheidsgerecht waaraan krachtens het bepaalde in dit Deel een geschil is voorgelegd, past de betrokken bepalingen van het Zeerechtverdrag, van deze Overeenkomst, van relevante visserijovereenkomsten in subregionaal, regionaal of mondiaal verband, en de algemeen aanvaarde regels voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de levende rijkdommen van de zee, alsmede de andere regels van internationaal recht die niet in strijd zijn met het Zeerechtverdrag toe in het perspectief van de instandhouding van de betrokken grensoverschrijdende en over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden.   

### Artikel  31  

####Voorlopige maatregelen

1.  In afwachting van de beslechting van een geschil overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit Deel stellen de partijen bij het geschil alles in het werk om tot voorlopige praktische regelingen te komen.   
2.  Onverminderd artikel 290 van het Zeerechtverdrag mag een hof- of scheidsgerecht waaraan het geschil krachtens het bepaalde in dit Deel is voorgelegd alle voorlopige maatregelen voorschrijven die het onder de omstandigheden passend acht om de onderscheiden rechten van de partijen bij het geschil in stand te houden of schade aan de betrokken visbestanden te voorkomen, en die het passend oordeelt in de omstandigheden als bedoeld in artikel 7, lid 5, en artikel 16, lid 2.   
3.  Een Staat die Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst, maar geen Partij is bij het Zeerechtverdrag mag verklaren dat, ongeacht artikel 290, lid 5, van het Zeerechtverdrag, het Internationale Hof voor het Recht van de Zee niet het recht heeft om zonder instemming van die Staat voorlopige maatregelen voor te schrijven, te wijzigen of te herroepen.   

### Artikel  32  

####Beperkingen inzake de toepasselijkheid van de geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures

Artikel 297, lid 3, van het Zeerechtverdrag is ook van toepassing voor deze Overeenkomst.

### Artikel  36  

####Herzieningsconferentie

1.  Vier jaar na de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst roept de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties een conferentie bijeen om de efficiëncy van deze Overeenkomst op het punt van de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden te evalueren. De Secretaris-Generaal zendt voor deze conferentie een uitnodiging aan alle Staten die partij zijn en aan alle Staten en lichamen die partij mogen worden bij deze Overeenkomst, alsmede aan de intergouvernementele en niet-gouvernementele organisaties die als waarnemer aan de werkzaamheden in het kader van de Overeenkomst mogen deelnemen.

De Secretaris-Generaal brengt die kennisgeving over aan alle Staten die Partij zijn. Hij roept de conferentie bijeen als binnen zes maanden vanaf de datum van toezending van de kennisgeving ten minste de helft van de Staten die Partij zijn, positief antwoordt op het verzoek.   
2.  De besluitvormingsprocedure op de krachtens lid 1 bijeengeroepen wijzigingsconferentie is dezelfde als die welke is toegepast bij de Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties over de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden, tenzij de conferentie anders besluit. De conferentie stelt alles in het werk om een consensus te bereiken over de wijzigingen en er wordt niet over de wijzigingen gestemd voordat alle mogelijkheden om tot consensus te komen, zijn benut.   
3.  Vanaf de datum van aanneming staan de wijzigingen op deze Overeenkomst, tenzij daarin anders bepaald, op de zetel van de Verenigde Naties gedurende twaalf maanden open voor ondertekening door de Staten die Partij zijn.

Voor elke Staat die Partij is en die een wijziging bekrachtigt of ertoe toetreedt nadat het vereiste aantal akten van bekrachtiging of toetreding is nedergelegd, treedt de wijziging in werking op de dertigste dag na de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.   
6.  In een wijziging mag worden bepaald dat voor de inwerkingtreding daarvan een kleiner of groter aantal bekrachtigingen of toetredingen vereist is dan in dit artikel is bepaald.   
7.  Een Staat die Partij wordt bij deze Overeenkomst nadat overeenkomstig lid 5 wijzigingen in werking zijn getreden, wordt, tenzij hij anders te kennen heeft gegeven, beschouwd als: 

a. Partij bij deze Overeenkomst zoals die is gewijzigd, en  

b. Partij bij de ongewijzigde Overeenkomst ten opzichte van iedere Staat die Partij is, maar die niet gebonden is door de wijzigingen.     

### Artikel  46  

####Opzegging

1.  Een Staat die Partij is, kan door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties deze Overeenkomst opzeggen en daarbij de redenen aangeven. Als geen redenen worden aangegeven, verandert dat niets aan de geldigheid van de opzegging. De opzegging wordt een jaar na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving van kracht, tenzij een latere datum wordt aangegeven.   
2.  De opzegging verandert niets aan de plicht van een Staat die partij is, om elke in deze Overeenkomst neergelegde verplichting na te komen die, onafhankelijk van deze Overeenkomst, volgens het internationale recht voor hem zou gelden.   

### Artikel  47

a. bij de ondertekening van of de toetreding tot de Overeenkomst legt zo'n internationale organisatie een verklaring af 

i. dat zij bevoegd is voor alle onderwerpen die door deze Overeenkomst worden geregeld,  

ii. dat daarom haar Lid-Staten geen Staten die Partij zijn, zullen worden, tenzij voor hun grondgebied waarvoor de internationale organisatie geen verantwoordelijkheid heeft,  

iii. dat zij de krachtens deze Overeenkomst voor Staten geldende rechten en verplichtingen aanvaardt;    

b. deelneming door een internationale organisatie geeft in geen geval rechten krachtens deze Overeenkomst aan de Lid-Staten van die internationale organisatie;  

c. in het geval van strijdigheid tussen de verplichtingen van een internationale organisatie krachtens deze Overeenkomst en haar verplichtingen krachtens de overeenkomst tot oprichting van die organisatie of krachtens enige daarmee verband houdende akte, hebben de verplichtingen krachtens deze Overeenkomst voorrang.     

### Artikel  48  

####Bijlagen

1.  De Bijlagen vormen een integrerend deel van deze Overeenkomst en een verwijzing naar deze Overeenkomst of naar een van de Delen ervan houdt, tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald, tevens een verwijzing in naar de betrokken Bijlagen.   
2.  De Bijlagen kunnen van tijd tot tijd door de Staten die Partij zijn, worden herzien. Die herzieningen worden gebaseerd op wetenschappelijke en technische overwegingen. Ongeacht het bepaalde in artikel 45 wordt een herziening van een Bijlage die bij consensus is aangenomen in een vergadering van de Staten die Partij zijn, in de Overeenkomst opgenomen vanaf de datum van aanneming of de andere datum die in die herziening is bepaald, en geldt die herziening ook vanaf de betrokken datum. Als een herziening van een Bijlage niet bij consensus in een dergelijke vergadering wordt aangenomen, zijn de in artikel 45 vastgestelde wijzigingsprocedures van toepassing.

### Bijlage  I  

####Normen voor het verzamelen en uitwisselen van gegevens

### Artikel  1  

####Algemene beginselen

1.  Voor een doeltreffende instandhouding en een doeltreffend beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden is het van fundamenteel belang dat tijdig gegevens worden verzameld, gegroepeerd en geanalyseerd. Daartoe moeten gegevens over de visserij op deze bestanden in de volle zee en in de gebieden onder nationale jurisdictie zo worden verzameld en gegroepeerd dat relevante statistische analyses voor de instandhouding en het beheer van de betrokken bestanden kunnen worden gemaakt. Deze gegevens omvatten statistieken over vangsten en visserij-inspanning en andere met de visserij verband houdende gegevens, zoals gegevens met betrekking tot vaartuigen en andere gegevens voor normalisatie van de visserij-inspanning. De gegevens dienen ook informatie te verschaffen over niet-doelsoorten en verwante of afhankelijke soorten. Met het oog op de juistheid ervan worden alle gegevens geverifieerd. Niet-geaggregeerde gegevens blijven vertrouwelijk. Voor verspreiding van die gegevens blijven de voorwaarden gelden waarop zij zijn verstrekt.   
2.  Aan de Ontwikkelingslanden wordt bijstand gegeven, waaronder opleidingen, zowel financiële als technische bijstand, om hun eigen mogelijkheden op het vlak van de instandhouding en het beheer van de levende rijkdommen van de zee te vergroten. De bijstand wordt geconcentreerd op vergroting van de capaciteit wat betreft het verzamelen en de verificatie van gegevens, waarnemersprogramma's, analyse van gegevens, alsmede onderzoekprojecten voor ondersteuning van de evaluatie van visbestanden. Er worden zoveel mogelijk wetenschapsmensen en managers uit Ontwikkelingslanden bij de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden betrokken.   

### Artikel  2  

####Beginselen voor het verzamelen, de groepering en de uitwisseling van gegevens

Bij het bepalen van de parameters voor het verzamelen, de groepering en de uitwisseling van gegevens over de visserij op de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden wordt uitgegaan van de volgende algemene beginselen: 

a. de Staten zorgen ervoor dat over de visserij-activiteit van vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren, gegevens worden verzameld volgens de technische kenmerken van iedere vismethode (bijv. per trek voor de visserij met het sleepnet, per trek voor de visserij met beuglijnen en ringzegens, per beviste school voor de hengelvisserij, en per dag voor de sleeplijnenvisserij) en gedetailleerd genoeg voor een doeltreffende evaluatie van de bestanden;  

b. de Staten zorgen ervoor dat de visserijgegevens adequaat worden geverifieerd;  

c. de Staten groeperen de met de visserij verband houdende gegevens en de andere ondersteunende wetenschappelijke gegevens en doen ze in het overeengekomen formaat tijdig toekomen aan de instanties van een eventuele organisatie of een eventueel akkoord voor het beheer van de visserij in subregionaal of regionaal verband. Bij gebreke daarvan dienen de Staten samen te werken voor rechtstreekse gegevensuitwisseling of voor uitwisseling via door hen overeen te komen samenwerkingsvormen;  

d. de Staten dienen, in het kader van subregionale of regionale organisaties of akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, dan wel anderszins, overeenkomstig deze Bijlage en voorts rekening houdende met de aard van de visbestanden en van de visserij daarop in het betrokken gebied, tot overeenstemming te komen over de specifieke gegevens die en het formaat waarin ze moeten worden verstrekt. In het kader van die organisaties of akkoorden wordt aan niet-leden van de organisatie en niet-partijen bij het akkoord verzocht gegevens te verstrekken over de betrokken visserijactiviteit van de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren;  

e. in het kader van dergelijke organisaties of akkoorden worden de gegevens gegroepeerd en, onder de in genoemd kader vastgestelde voorwaarden, tijdig in een overeengekomen formaat beschikbaar gesteld aan alle belangstellende Staten;  

f. de wetenschapsmensen van de Vlaggestaat en de wetenschapsmensen die actief zijn in het kader van de betrokken organisatie of het betrokken akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband analyseren, naar gelang van het geval, de gegevens afzonderlijk of in samenwerking.    

### Artikel  3  

####Basisgegevens over de visserij

1.  De Staten verzamelen de volgende categorieën gegevens gedetailleerd genoeg en stellen ze beschikbaar aan de instanties van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer voor een doeltreffende evaluatie van de visbestanden volgens erkende procedures: 

a. tijdreeksen van vangststatistieken en visserij-inspanningsstatistieken per visserijtak en per vloot;  

b. gegevens over de totale vangst, in aantallen of nominaal gewicht of beide, per soort (zowel doelsoorten als niet-doelsoorten), naar gelang van de visserijtak; (Nominaal gewicht is door de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties gedefinieerd als het levend gewicht dat correspondeert met het gewicht van de aanvoer.)  

c. statistieken over de teruggooi, waaronder zo nodig ramingen, in aantallen of nominaal gewicht per soort, naar gelang van de visserijtak;  

d. visserij-inspanningsstatistieken per vangstmethode;  

e. visplaats, visdata en vistijd en andere eventueel benodigde statistieken over de visserij.     
2.  Zo nodig verzamelen de Staten ter ondersteuning van de evaluatie van de visbestanden ook de onderstaande gegevens en stellen ze die beschikbaar aan de instanties van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer: 

a. samenstelling van de vangst volgens lengte, gewicht en geslacht;  

b. andere biologische gegevens ter ondersteuning van evaluatie van de visbestanden, zoals gegevens over leeftijd, groei, recrutering, verspreiding en identiteit van het visbestand, en  

c. ander relevant onderzoek, waaronder bestandopnames ter bepaling van de getalssterkte, bestandopnames ter bepaling van de biomassa, hydro-akoestische bestandopnames, onderzoek met betrekking tot milieufactoren die van invloed zijn op de getalssterkte, en oceanografisch en ecologisch onderzoek.     

### Artikel  4  

####Gegevens en informatie over vissersvaartuigen

1.  De Staten verzamelen de volgende categorieën op de vaartuigen betrekking hebbende gegevens met het oog op gestandaardiseerde overzichten van de samenstelling van de vloot en het motorvermogen, en om bij de analyse van gegevens over vangsten en visserij-inspanning de ene meeteenheid in de andere te kunnen omrekenen: 

a. identiteit, Vlaggestaat en haven van registratie van het vissersvaartuig;  

b. vaartuigtype;  

c. kenmerken van het vaartuig (bijv. materiaal waarvan het gebouwd is, bouwdatum, geregistreerde lengte, GT, vermogen van de hoofdmotoren, inhoud van het ruim en methoden voor opslag van de vangst), en  

d. beschrijving van het vistuig (type, specificaties en aantal).     
2.  De Vlaggestaat verzamelt informatie over: 

a. apparatuur voor navigatie en positiebepaling;  

b. communicatie-apparatuur en internationale radioroepnaam, en  

c. grootte van de bemanning.     

### Artikel  5  

####Gegevensmelding

De Staten zorgen ervoor dat de vaartuigen die hun vlag voeren aan de bevoegde nationale instanties voor de visserij en, indien zulks is overeengekomen, de instanties van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, de logboekgegevens over de vangsten en de visserij-inspanning, met inbegrip van de gegevens over de visserij-activiteit op de volle zee, met een zodanige frequentie doen toekomen dat aan de nationale bepalingen en aan de regionale en internationale verplichtingen wordt voldaan. Deze gegevens worden, zo nodig, per radio, telex, fax, satelliet of via andere middelen doorgegeven.  

### Artikel  6  

####Verificatie van de gegevens

De Staten of, naar gelang van het geval, de instanties van de subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer treffen regelingen om de gegevens over de visserij te verifiëren, zoals bij voorbeeld 

a. systemen voor monitoring van de positie van de vaartuigen;  

b. programma's met wetenschappelijke waarnemers die toezicht houden op de vangsten, de visserij-inspanning, de samenstelling van de vangst (doelsoorten en niet-doelsoorten) en andere details met betrekking tot de visserij-activiteit;  

c. rapporten over visreizen, aanvoer en overlading, en  

d. bemonstering in de havens.    

### Artikel  7  

####Uitwisseling van gegevens

1.  De Vlaggestaten delen, via de instanties van de betrokken subregionale of regionale organisaties en akkoorden voor visserijbeheer, de gegevens die zij hebben verzameld, met andere Vlaggestaten en betrokken Kuststaten. De instanties van die organisaties en akkoorden groeperen de gegevens en stellen ze, onder de in dat kader vastgestelde voorwaarden, tijdig en in een overeengekomen formaat beschikbaar aan alle belangstellende Staten, er daarbij voor zorgend dat de vertrouwelijkheid van de niet-geaggregeerde gegevens behouden blijft; deze instanties ontwikkelen, in de mate van het mogelijke, gegevensbanken met efficiënte toegang tot die gegevens.   
2.  Op mondiaal niveau worden de betrokken gegevens verzameld en verspreid via de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties. Bij gebreke van een organisatie of akkoord voor visserijbeheer in subregionaal of regionaal verband mag de FAO, mits instemming van de betrokken Staten, die werkzaamheden voor de betrokken subregio of regio uitvoeren.   

### Bijlage  II  

####Richtlijnen voor de toepassing van preventieve referentiewaarden bij de instandhouding en het beheer van de grensoverschrijdende en de over grote afstanden trekkende visbestanden

### 1  

Een preventieve referentiewaarde is een via een erkende wetenschappelijke procedure geraamde waarde die overeenkomt met de situatie van het bestand en de betrokken visserij en die kan worden gebruikt als oriëntatiepunt voor het visserijbeheer.  

### 2  

Er worden twee soorten preventieve referentiewaarden gebruikt: instandhoudingslimieten en streefcijfers. Instandhoudingslimieten geven grenzen aan om de bevissing binnen veilige biologische grenzen te houden waarbij de visbestanden een maximale duurzame opbrengst geven. Streefcijfers worden gehanteerd met het oog op beheersdoelstellingen.  

### 3  

Preventieve referentiewaarden moeten per bestand worden vastgesteld, zodat onder andere rekening kan worden gehouden met het reproduktievermogen, het herstelvermogen en de kenmerken van de bevissing van het betrokken bestand, alsmede met andere oorzaken van mortaliteit en met de belangrijkste onzekerheidsfactoren.  

### 4  

De beheersstrategieën dienen erop gericht te zijn om de beviste bestanden, en zo nodig de verwante of afhankelijke soorten, te houden of terug te brengen op een niveau dat consistent is met vooraf overeengekomen preventieve referentiewaarden. Deze referentiewaarden dienen om bij het bereiken ervan te reageren met vooraf overeengekomen instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen. De beheersstrategieën omvatten maatregelen die kunnen worden toegepast wanneer de referentiewaarden bijna bereikt zijn.  

### 5  

De strategieën voor visserijbeheer worden zo opgezet dat het risico dat de instandhoudingslimieten overschreden worden zeer gering is. Als de grootte van een bestand daalt of dreigt te dalen tot onder een instandhoudingslimiet, moet worden begonnen met instandhoudings- en beheersmaatregelen om het herstel van dat bestand te bevorderen. De strategieën voor visserijbeheer worden zo opgezet dat de streefcijfers gemiddeld niet worden overschreden.  

### 6  

Wanneer over een visserijtak weinig of geen gegevens beschikbaar zijn om de referentiewaarden te bepalen, worden voorlopige referentiewaarden vastgesteld. Voorlopige referentiewaarden kunnen worden vastgesteld naar analogie van die voor soortgelijke visbestanden waarover meer gegevens bekend zijn. In die gevallen is verscherpte monitoring ten aanzien van de betrokken visserijtak geboden, zodat de voorlopige referentiewaarden kunnen worden herzien zodra betere gegevens beschikbaar komen.  

### 7  

De visserijmortaliteit waarbij de maximaal duurzame opbrengst wordt behaald, is de minimumnorm voor de instandhoudingslimieten. Voor bestanden die niet overbevist zijn, worden de strategieën voor visserijbeheer zo opgezet dat de visserijmortaliteit niet groter is dan die welke overeenkomt met de maximaal duurzame opbrengst en dat de biomassa niet onder een vooraf bepaald niveau daalt. Voor overbeviste bestanden kan de biomassa die de maximaal duurzame opbrengst zou geven, als doel voor het herstel van het bestand gelden.
