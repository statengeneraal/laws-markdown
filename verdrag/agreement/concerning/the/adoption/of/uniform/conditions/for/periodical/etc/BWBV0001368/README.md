##Verdrag betreffende het aannemen van eenvormige voorwaarden voor periodieke technische keuringen van motorvoertuigen en de wederzijdse erkenning van dergelijke keuringen

####Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform conditions for periodical technical inspections of wheeled vehicles and the reciprocal recognition of such inspections

Preamble The Contracting Parties, Recognizing the growth of road traffic and the resultant increase in danger and nuisance which presents all Contracting Parties with safety and environmental problems of a similar nature and seriousness; Desiring to achieve greater uniformity in the rules governing road traffic in Europe and to ensure a higher level of safety and protection of the environment; Desiring to define for this purpose uniform conditions on Periodical Technical Inspections of wheeled vehicles that it will suffice for these vehicles to fulfil in order to be certified in their countries; Whereas the time needed to carry out such Periodical Technical Inspections of certain wheeled vehicles and the expense thereby incurred are factors which can affect the competitive conditions between roadtransport operators in the territories of the Contracting Parties; whereas the present systems of testing vary from one territory to another; Whereas it is therefore necessary to harmonize as far as possible the frequency of tests and the compulsory items to be tested; Whereas the fixing of the date of application of the measure referred to in this Agreement should allow time for the administrative and technical arrangements required for carrying out the tests to be set up or extended in scope; Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

The Contracting Parties shall establish Rules for periodical technical inspections of wheeled vehicles registered in their territory and shall reciprocally recognize the inspections carried out in accordance with those Rules. The Rules shall be established through an Administrative Committee made up of all the Contracting Parties in conformity with the Rules of Procedure set out in Appendix 1 and on the basis of the following paragraphs and articles. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “wheeled vehicles" shall include any motor vehicles and their trailers; the term “technical inspection" shall include the inspection of any equipment and parts which are used on wheeled vehicles and whose characteristics have a bearing on road safety, protection of the environment and energy saving; the term “rules for periodical technical inspections of wheeled vehicles" shall include provisions for the proof of the periodical administrative uniform procedure by which the competent authorities of a Contracting Party declare, after the required verifications have been carried out, that the wheeled vehicle conforms to the requirements of the given Rules. As proof shall serve a technical inspection certificate the model of which is reproduced in Appendix 2 to this Agreement.  

### Article  2  

1.  A Rule, after having been established in accordance with the procedure indicated in Appendix 1, shall be communicated by the Administrative Committee to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, hereinafter called “Secretary-General". As soon as possible thereafter the Secretary-General shall give notification of this Rule to the Contracting Parties. The Rule will be considered as adopted unless, within a period of six months from its notification by the Secretary-General, more than one-third of the Contracting Parties at the time of notification have informed the Secretary-General of their disagreement with the Rule. The Rule shall cover the following: 

a) the categories of wheeled vehicles concerned and the frequency of its inspection;  

b) the equipment and/or parts to be inspected;  

c) Test methods by which any performance requirements are to be demonstrated;  

d) Conditions for granting inspection certificate;  

e) The date(s) on which the Rule enters into force.   The Rule may, if needed, include references to the test centres accredited by the competent authorities where the inspections of wheeled vehicles may be carried out.   
2.  When a Rule has been adopted the Secretary-General shall so notify as soon as possible all the Contracting Parties, specifying which Contracting Parties have objected and in respect of which the Rule shall not enter into force.   
3.  The adopted Rule shall enter into force on the date(s) specified therein as a Rule annexed to this Agreement for all Contracting Parties which did not notify their disagreement.   
4.  Any new Contracting Party may, when depositing its instrument of accession, declare that it is not bound by certain Rules then annexed to this Agreement or that it is not bound by any of them. If, at that time, the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article is in progress for a draft rule, the Secretary-General shall communicate such draft rule to the new Contracting Party and the draft shall enter into force as a Rule for the new Contracting Party only on the conditions specified in paragraph 3 of this Article, the time allowed being counted from the date of the communication of the draft to that Party. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of the date of such entry into force. He shall also communicate to them all declarations concerning the non-application of certain Rules that any Contracting Party may make in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.   
5.  Any Contracting Party applying a Rule may at any time notify the Secretary-General, subject to one year's notice, that its administration intends to cease applying it. Such notification shall be communicated by the Secretary-General to the other Contracting Parties.   
6.  Any Contracting Party not applying a Rule may at any time notify the Secretary-General that it intends henceforth to apply it, and the Rule will then enter into force for this Party on the sixtieth day after this notification. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of every entry into force of a Rule for a new Contracting Party effected in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.   
7.  The Contracting Parties for which a Rule is in force shall hereinafter be referred to as “the Contracting Parties applying a Rule."   
8.  The Rules annexed to this Agreement as Addenda to this Agreement shall form an integral part thereof.   

### Article  3  

The Rules annexed to this Agreement may be amended in accordance with the following procedure:  
1.  Amendments to Rules shall be established by the Administrative Committee as described in Articles 1 and 2 and in accordance with the procedure indicated in Appendix 1. An amendment to the Rule, after having been established, shall be communicated by the Administrative Committee to the Secretary-General. As soon as possible thereafter the Secretary-General shall give notification of this amendment to the Contracting Parties applying the Rule.   
2.  An amendment to a Rule will be considered to be adopted unless, within a period of six months from its notification by the Secretary-General, more than one-third of the Contracting Parties applying the Rule at the time of notification have informed the Secretary-General of their disagreement with the amendment. If, after this period, the Secretary-General has not received declarations of disagreement of more than one-third of the Contracting Parties applying the Rule, the Secretary-General shall as soon as possible declare the amendment as adopted and binding upon those Contracting Parties applying the Rule who did not declare themselves opposed to it. When a Rule is amended and at least one-fifth of the Contracting Parties applying the unamended Rule subsequently declare that they wish to continue to apply the unamended Rule, the unamended Rule will be regarded as an alternative to the amended Rule and will be incorporated formally as such into the Rule with effect from the date of adoption of the amendment or its entry into force. In this case the obligations of the Contracting Parties applying the Rule shall be the same as set out in paragraph 1.   
3.  Should a new Contracting Party accede to this Agreement between the time of the notification of the amendment to a Rule by the Secretary-General and its entry into force, the Rule in question shall not enter into force for that Contracting Party until two months after it has formally accepted the amendment or two months after the lapse of a period of six months since the communication to that Party by the Secretary-General of the proposed amendment.

####Verdrag betreffende het aannemen van eenvormige voorwaarden voor periodieke technische keuringen van motorvoertuigen en de wederzijdse erkenning van dergelijke keuringen

Preambule De Verdragsluitende Partijen, Erkennende de toename van het wegverkeer en de daaruit voortvloeiende gevaren en overlast, hetgeen alle Verdragsluitende Partijen op het gebied van veiligheid en milieu voor problemen van dezelfde aard en ernst stelt; Geleid door de wens een grotere eenvormigheid van de regelgeving inzake het wegverkeer in Europa tot stand te brengen en een hoger niveau van veiligheid en milieubescherming te verzekeren; Geleid door de wens hiertoe eenvormige voorwaarden terzake van periodieke technische keuringen van motorvoertuigen vast te stellen waaraan deze voertuigen ten minste moeten voldoen om in hun Staten te worden goedgekeurd; In aanmerking nemende dat de tijd die nodig is om deze periodieke technische keuringen van bepaalde motorvoertuigen uit te voeren en de hiermee verbonden uitgaven factoren zijn die van invloed kunnen zijn op de mededingingsomstandigheden tussen wegtransportondernemers op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partijen; in aanmerking nemende dat de huidige keuringssystemen per grondgebied verschillen; In aanmerking nemende dat het derhalve noodzakelijk is de keuringsfrequentie en de zaken die verplicht moeten worden gecontroleerd zoveel mogelijk op elkaar af te stemmen; In aanmerking nemende dat bij het vaststellen van een datum voor de toepassing van de in dit Verdrag bedoelde maatregelen rekening dient te worden gehouden met de tijd die nodig is voor het opstellen van de administratieve en technische regelingen die vereist zijn voor het verrichten van de controles of voor het uitbreiden van de werkingssfeer daarvan; Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

De Verdragsluitende Partijen stellen Voorschriften vast voor periodieke technische keuringen van motorvoertuigen die op hun grondgebied zijn geregistreerd en erkennen de overeenkomstig deze Voorschriften uitgevoerde keuringen wederzijds. De Voorschriften worden vastgesteld door tussenkomst van een Commissie van beheer bestaande uit alle Verdragsluitende Partijen in overeenstemming met het in Aanhangsel 1 opgenomen Voorschrift van orde en ingevolge de hiernavolgende leden en artikelen. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: wordt onder de term „motorvoertuigen" verstaan ieder motorvoertuig en de daarbij behorende aanhangwagen; wordt onder de term „technische keuring" verstaan de keuring van alle uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen die worden gebruikt op motorvoertuigen en waarvan de eigenschappen verband houden met verkeersveiligheid, milieubescherming en energiebesparing; onder de term „Voorschriften voor periodieke technische keuringen van motorvoertuigen" wordt verstaan bepalingen inzake het bewijs van de eenvormige periodieke administratieve procedure door middel waarvan de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Verdragsluitende Partij verklaren, nadat de vereiste toetsingen hebben plaatsgevonden, dat het motorvoertuig voldoet aan de eisen van de desbetreffende Voorschriften. Als bewijs kan dienen een technisch keuringsbewijs, waarvan het model is opgenomen in Aanhangsel 2 bij dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  2  

1.  Nadat een Voorschrift is opgesteld in overeenstemming met de in Aanhangsel 1 opgenomen procedure, wordt de tekst hiervan door de Commissie van beheer medegedeeld aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, hierna te noemen „Secretaris-Generaal".

Wanneer een Voorschrift is aangenomen, stelt de Secretaris-Generaal alle Verdragsluitende Partijen zo spoedig mogelijk hiervan in kennis, waarbij hij aangeeft welke Verdragsluitende Partijen bezwaar hebben gemaakt en ten aanzien van welke Verdragsluitende Partijen het Voorschrift niet in werking treedt.   
3.  Het aangenomen Voorschrift treedt op de daarin vermelde datum of data als Voorschrift behorend bij dit Verdrag in werking ten aanzien van alle Verdragsluitende Partijen die geen kennis hebben gedaan het hiermee niet eens te zijn.   
4.  Elke nieuwe Verdragsluitende Partij kan, wanneer zij haar akte van toetreding nederlegt, verklaren dat zij niet gebonden is door bepaalde Voorschriften, op dat tijdstip behorend bij dit Verdrag, of dat zij door geen enkele daarvan is gebonden. Indien op dat tijdstip de werkwijze geregeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid van dit artikel voor een ontwerp-voorschrift wordt gevolgd, deelt de Secretaris-Generaal dit ontwerp aan de nieuwe Verdragsluitende Partij mede en het ontwerp treedt ten aanzien van de nieuwe Verdragsluitende Partij slechts in werking als Voorschrift onder de voorwaarden genoemd in het derde lid van dit artikel, waarbij de termijnen worden gerekend vanaf de datum waarop aan die Partij het ontwerp is medegedeeld. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen de datum van deze inwerkingtreding mede. Hij deelt hun eveneens mede alle verklaringen die de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende het niet toepassen van bepaalde Voorschriften ingevolge dit lid hebben afgelegd.   
5.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij die een Voorschrift toepast, kan te allen tijde, met een termijn van een jaar, de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis stellen dat haar bevoegde autoriteiten dit Voorschrift niet langer zullen toepassen. De Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze kennisgeving aan de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen mede.   
6.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij die een Voorschrift niet toepast, kan te allen tijde de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis stellen dat zij dit Voorschrift voortaan wenst toe te passen; het Voorschrift treedt ten aanzien van deze Partij in werking op de zestigste dag na deze kennisgeving. De Secretaris-Generaal geeft aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen kennis van iedere inwerkingtreding van een Voorschrift ten aanzien van een nieuwe Verdragsluitende Partij, welke zich voordoet ingevolge dit lid.   
7.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen ten aanzien van wie een Voorschrift van kracht is, worden in dit Verdrag verder genoemd „Verdragsluitende Partijen die een Voorschrift toepassen".

Indien de Secretaris-Generaal na het verstrijken van deze periode geen verklaringen van bezwaar heeft ontvangen van meer dan een derde van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die het Voorschrift toepassen, verklaart de Secretaris-Generaal zo spoedig mogelijk dat de wijziging is aangenomen en bindend is ten aanzien van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die het Voorschrift toepassen en die tegen de wijziging geen bezwaar hebben gemaakt. Wanneer een Voorschrift wordt gewijzigd en ten minste een vijfde van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die het ongewijzigde Voorschrift toepassen vervolgens verklaren dat zij het ongewijzigde Voorschrift willen blijven toepassen, wordt het ongewijzigde Voorschrift beschouwd als een alternatieve versie van het gewijzigde Voorschrift en wordt het met ingang van het tijdstip van aanneming of inwerkingtreding van de wijziging als zodanig formeel opgenomen in het Voorschrift. In dit geval zijn de verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die het Voorschrift toepassen dezelfde als de verplichtingen bedoeld in het eerste lid.   
3.  In het geval dat een nieuwe Verdragsluitende Partij tot dit Verdrag toetreedt tussen de kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal van de wijziging van een Voorschrift en de inwerkingtreding van die wijziging, kan het desbetreffende Voorschrift ten aanzien van deze Verdragsluitende Partij niet eerder in werking treden dan twee maanden nadat deze Partij de wijziging formeel aanvaard heeft, dan wel twee maanden na het verstrijken van een termijn van zes maanden na de mededeling door de Secretaris-Generaal aan deze Partij van de voorgestelde wijziging.
