####TREATY OF PEACE WITH JAPAN

Whereas the Allied Powers and Japan are resolved that henceforth their relations shall be those of nations which, as sovereign equals, cooperate in friendly association to promote their common welfare and to maintain international peace and security, and are therefore desirous of concluding a Treaty of Peace which will settle questions still outstanding as a result of the existence of a state of war between them; Whereas Japan for its part declares its intention to apply for membership in the United Nations and in all circumstances to conform to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations; to strive to realize the objectives of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; to seek to create within Japan conditions of stability and well-being as defined in Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations and already initiated by post-surrender Japanese legislation; and in public and private trade and commerce to conform to internationally accepted fair practices; Whereas the Allied Powers welcome the intentions of Japan set out in the foregoing paragraph;   The Allied Powers and Japan have therefore determined to conclude the present Treaty of Peace, and have accordingly appointed the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, who, after presentation of their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following provisions:

### Article  12

The reciprocity envisaged in the foregoing sentence shall be determined, in the case of products, vessels and juridical entities of, and persons domiciled in, any non-metropolitan territory of an Allied Power, and in the case of juridical entities of, and persons domiciled in, any state or province of an Allied Power having a federal government, by reference to the treatment accorded to Japan in such territory, state or province.   
(d).  In the application of this Article, a discriminatory measure shall not be considered to derogate from the grant of national or most-favored-nation treatment, as the case may be, if such measure is based on an exception customarily provided for in the commercial treaties of the party applying it, or on the need to safeguard that party's external financial position or balance of payments (except in respect to shipping and navigation), or on the need to maintain its essential security interests, and provided such measure is proportionate to the circumstances and not applied in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.   
(e).  Japan's obligations under this Article shall not be affected by the exercise of any Allied rights under Article 14 of the present Treaty; nor shall the provisions of this Article be understood as limiting the undertakings assumed by Japan by virtue of Article 15 of the Treaty.

### CHAPTER  V  

####Claims and property

### Article  14  

(a).  It is recognized that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Nevertheless it is also recognized that the resources of Japan are not presently sufficient, if it is to maintain a viable economy, to make complete reparation for all such damage and suffering and at the same time meet its other obligations. Therefore, 

1. Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring, whose present territories were occupied by Japanese forces and damaged by Japan, with a view to assisting to compensate those countries for the cost of repairing the damage done, by making available the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for the Allied Powers in question. Such arrangements shall avoid the imposition of additional liabilities on other Allied Powers, and, where the manufacturing of raw materials is called for, they shall be supplied by the Allied Powers in question, so as not to throw any foreign exchange burden upon Japan.  

2. 
(I) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (II) below, each of the Allied Powers shall have the right to seize, retain, liquidate or otherwise dispose of all property, rights and interests of 

(a) Japan and Japanese nationals,  

(b) persons acting for or on behalf of Japan or Japanese nationals, and  

(c) entities owned or controlled by Japan or Japanese nationals, which on the first coming into force of the present Treaty were subject to its jurisdiction. The property, rights and interests specified in this sub-paragraph shall include those now blocked, vested or in the possession or under the control of enemy property authorities of Allied Powers, which belonged to, or were held or managed on behalf of, any of the persons or entities mentioned in *(a), (b)* or *(c)* above at the time such assets came under the controls of such authorities.    

(II) The following shall be excepted from the right specified in sub-paragraph (I) above: 

(i) property of Japanese natural persons who during the war resided with the permission of the Government concerned in the territory of one of the Allied Powers, other than territory occupied by Japan, except property subjected to restrictions during the war and not released from such restrictions as of the date of the first coming into force of the present Treaty;  

(ii) all real property, furniture and fixtures owned by the Government of Japan and used for diplomatic or consular purposes, and all personal furniture and furnishings and other private property not of an investment nature which was normally necessary for the carrying out of diplomatic and consular functions, owned by Japanese diplomatic and consular personnel;  

(iii) property belonging to religious bodies or private charitable institutions and used exclusively for religious or charitable purposes;  

(iv) property, rights and interests which have come within its jurisdiction in consequence of the resumption of trade and financial relations subsequent to September 2, 1945, between the country concerned and Japan, except such as have resulted from transactions contrary to the laws of the Allied Power concerned;  

(v) obligations of Japan or Japanese nationals, any rigth, title or interest in tangible property located in Japan, interests in enterprises organized under the laws of Japan, or any paper evidence thereof; provided that this exception shall only apply to obligations of Japan and its nationals expressed in Japanese currency.    

(III) Property referred to in exceptions (i) through (v) above shall be returned subject to reasonable expenses for its preservation and administration. If any such property has been liquidated the proceeds shall be returned instead.  

(IV) The right to seize, retain, liquidate or otherwise dispose of property as provided in sub-paragraph (I) above shall be exercised in accordance with the laws of the Allied Power concerned, and the owner shall have only such rights as may be given him by those laws.  

(V) The Allied Powers agree to deal with Japanese trademarks and literary and artistic property rights on a basis as favorable to Japan as circumstances ruling in each country will permit.       
(b).  Except as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the war, and claims of the Allied Powers for direct military costs of occupation.   

### Article  15  

(a).  Upon application made within nine months of the coming into force of the present Treaty between Japan and the Allied Power concerned, Japan will, within six months of the date of such application, return the property, tangible and intangible, and all rights or interests of any kind in Japan of each Allied Power and its nationals which was within Japan at any time between December 7, 1941, and September 2, 1945, unless the owner has freely disposed thereof without duress or fraud. Such property shall be returned free of all encumbrances and charges to which it may have become subject because of the war, and without any charges for its return. Property whose return is not applied for by or on behalf of the owner or by his Government within the prescribed period may be disposed of by the Japanese Government as it may determine. In cases where such property was within Japan on December 7, 1941, and cannot be returned or has suffered injury or damage as a result of the war, compensation will be made on terms not less favorable than the terms provided in the draft Allied Powers Property Compensation Law approved by the Japanese Cabinet on July 13, 1951.   
(b).  With respect to industrial property rights impaired during the war, Japan will continue to accord to the Allied Powers and their nationals benefits no less than those heretofore accorded by Cabinet Orders No. 309 effective September 1, 1949, No. 12 effective January 28, 1950, and No. 9 effective February 1, 1950, all as now amended, provided such nationals have applied for such benefits within the time limits prescribed therein.   
(c).  

(i) Japan acknowledges that the literary and artistic property rights which existed in Japan on December 6, 1941, in respect to the published and unpublished works of the Allied Powers and their nationals have continued in force since that date, and recognizes those rights which have arisen, or but for the war would have arisen, in Japan since that date, by the operation of any conventions and agreements to which Japan was a party on that date, irrespective of whether or not such conventions or agreements were abrogated or suspended upon or since the outbreak of war by the domestic law of Japan or of the Allied Power concerned.  

(ii) Without the need for application by the proprietor of the right and without the payment of any fee or compliance with any other formality, the period from December 7, 1941, until the coming into force of the present Treaty between Japan and the Allied Power concerned shall be excluded from the running of the normal term of such rights; and such period, with an additional period of six months, shall be excluded from the time within which a literary work must be translated into Japanese in order to obtain translating rights in Japan.     

### Article  16  

As an expression of its desire to indemnify those members of the armed forces of the Allied Powers who suffered undue hardships while prisoners of war of Japan, Japan will transfer its assets and those of its nationals in countries which were neutral during the war, or which were at war with any of the Allied Powers, or, at its option, the equivalent of such assets, to the International Committee of the Red Cross which shall liquidate such assets and distribute the resultant fund to appropriate national agencies, for the benefit of former prisoners of war and their families on such basis as it may determine to be equitable. The categories of assets described in Article 14 *(a)* 2 (II) (ii) through (v) of the present Treaty shall be excepted from transfer, as well as assets of Japanese natural persons not residents of Japan on the first coming into force of the Treaty. It is equally understood that the transfer provision of this Article has no application to the 19,770 shares in the Bank for International Settlements presently owned by Japanese financial institutions.  

### Article  17  

(a).  Upon the request of any of the Allied Powers, the Japanese Government shall review and revise in conformity with international law any decision or order of the Japanese Prize Courts in cases involving ownership rights of nationals of that Allied Power and shall supply copies of all documents comprising the records of these cases, including the decisions taken and orders issued. In any case in which such review or revision shows that restoration is due, the provisions of Article 15 shall apply to the property concerned.   
(b).  The Japanese Government shall take the necessary measures to enable nationals of any of the Allied Powers at any time within one year from the coming into force of the present Treaty between Japan and the Allied Power concerned to submit to the appropriate Japanese authorities for review any judgment given by a Japanese court between December 7, 1941, and such coming into force, in any proceedings in which any such national was unable to make adequate presentation of his case either as plaintiff or defendant. The Japanese Government shall provide that, where the national has suffered injury by reason of any such judgment, he shall be restored in the position in which he was before the judgment was given or shall be afforded such relief as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.   

### Article  18  

(a).  It is recognized that the intervention of the state of war has not affected the obligation to pay pecuniary debts arising out of obligations and contracts (including those in respect of bonds) which existed and rights which were acquired before the existence of a state of war, and which are due by the Government or nationals of Japan to the Government or nationals of one of the Allied Powers, or are due by the Government or nationals of one of the Allied Powers to the Government or nationals of Japan. The intervention of a state of war shall equally not be regarded as affecting the obligation to consider on their merits claims for loss or damage to property or for personal injury or death which arose before the existence of a state of war, and which may be presented or re-presented by the Government of one of the Allied Powers to the Government of Japan, or by the Government of Japan to any of the Governments of the Allied Powers. The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to the rights conferred by Article 14.   
(b).  Japan affirms its liability for the prewar external debt of the Japanese State and for debts of corporate bodies subsequently declared to be liabilities of the Japanese State, and expresses its intention to enter into negotiations at an early date with its creditors with respect to the resumption of payments on those debts; to encourage negotiations in respect to other prewar claims and obligations; and to facilitate the transfer of sums accordingly.   

### Article  19  

(a).  Japan waives all claims of Japan and its nationals against the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of the war or out of actions taken because of the existence of a state of war, and waives all claims arising from the presence, operations or actions of forces or authorities of any of the Allied Powers in Japanese territory prior to the coming into force of the present Treaty.   
(b).  The foregoing waiver includes any claims arising out of actions taken by any of the Allied Powers with respect to Japanese ships between September 1, 1939, and the coming into force of the present Treaty, as well as any claims and debts arising in respect to Japanese prisoners of war and civilian internees in the hands of the Allied Powers, but does not include Japanese claims specifically recognized in the laws of any Allied Power enacted since September 2, 1945.   
(c).  Subject to reciprocal renunciation, the Japanese Government also renounces all claims (including debts) against Germany and German nationals on behalf of the Japanese Government and Japanese nationals, including intergovernmental claims and claims for loss or damage sustained during the war, but excepting (*a*) claims in respect of contracts entered into and rights acquired before September 1, 1939, and (*b*) claims arising out of trade and financial relations between Japan and Germany after September 2, 1945. Such renunciation shall not prejudice actions taken in accordance with Articles 16 and 20 of the present Treaty.   
(d).  Japan recognizes the validity of all acts and omissions done during the period of occupation under or in consequence of directives of the occupation authorities or authorized by Japanese law at that time, and will take no action subjecting Allied nationals to civil or criminal liability arising out of such acts or omissions.   

### Article  20  

Japan will take all necessary measures to ensure such disposition of German assets in Japan as has been or may be determined by those powers entitled under the Protocol of the proceedings of the Berlin Conference of 1945 to dispose of those assets, and pending the final disposition of such assets will be responsible for the conservation and administration thereof.  

### Article  21  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 25 of the present Treaty, China shall be entitled to the benefits of Articles 10 and 14 (*a*) 2; and Korea to the benefits of Articles 2, 4, 9 and 12 of the present Treaty.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####Settlement of disputes

### Article  22  

If in the opinion of any Party to the present Treaty there has arisen a dispute concerning the interpretation or execution of the Treaty, which is not settled by reference to a special claims tribunal or by other agreed means, the dispute shall, at the request of any party thereto, be referred for decision to the International Court of Justice. Japan and those Allied Powers which are not already parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice will deposit with the Registrar of the Court, at the time of their respective ratifications of the present Treaty, and in conformity with the resolution of the United Nations Security Council, dated October 15, 1946, a general declaration accepting; the jurisdiction, without special agreement, of the Court generally in respect to all disputes of the character referred to in this Article.  

### CHAPTER  VII

####PROTOCOL

The Undersigned, duly authorized to that effect, have agreed on the following provisions for regulating the question of Contracts, Periods of Prescription and Negotiable Instruments, and the question of Contracts of Insurance, upon the restoration of peace with Japan: 
###Contracts, Prescription and Negotiable Instruments

A.  *Contracts*  

1. Any contract which required for its execution intercourse between any of the parties thereto having become enemies as defined in part F shall, subject to the exceptions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 below, be deemed to have been dissolved as from the time when any of the parties thereto became enemies. Such dissolution, however, is without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 15 and 18 of the Treaty of Peace signed this day, nor shall it relieve any party to the contract from the obligation to repay amounts received as advances or as payments on account and in respect of which such party has not rendered performance in return.  

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, there shall be excepted from dissolution and, without prejudice to the rigths contained in Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace signed this day, there shall remain in force such parts of any contract as are severable and did not require for their execution intercourse between any of the parties thereto, having become enemies as defined in part F. Where the provisions of any contract are not so severable, the contract shall be deemed to have been dissolved in its entirety. The foregoing shall be subject to the application of domestic laws, orders or regulations made by a signatory hereto which is an Allied Power under the said Treaty of Peace and having jurisdiction over the contract or over any of the parties thereto and shall be subject to the terms of the contract.  

3. Nothing in part A shall be deemed to invalidate transactions lawfully carried out in accordance with a contract between enemies if they have been carried out with the authorization of the Government concerned being the Government of a signatory hereto which is an Allied Power under the said Treaty of Peace.  

4. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, contracts of insurance and reinsurance shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of parts D and E of the present Protocol.    

B.  *Periods of Prescription*  

1. All periods of prescription or limitation of right of action or of the right to take conservatory measures in respect of relations affecting persons or property, involving nationals of the signatories hereto who, by reason of the state of war, were unable to take judicial action or to comply with the formalities necessary to safeguard their rights, irrespective of whether these periods commenced before or after the outbreak of war, shall be regarded as having been suspended, for the duration of the war in Japanese territory on the one hand, and on the other hand in the territory of those signatories which grant to Japan, on a reciprocal basis, the benefit of the provisions of this paragraph. These periods shall begin to run again on the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace signed this day. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable in regard to the periods fixed for the presentation of interest or dividend coupons or for the presentation for payment of securities drawn for repayment or repayable on any other ground, provided that in respect of such coupons or securities the period shall begin to run again on the date when money becomes available for payments to the holder of the coupon or security.  

2. Where, on account of failure to perform any act or to comply with any formality during the war, measures of execution have been taken in Japanese territory to the prejudice of a national of one of the signatories being an Allied Power under the said Treaty of Peace, the Japanese Government shall restore the rights which have been detrimentally effected. If such restoration is impossible or would be inequitable the Japanese Government shall provide that the national of the signatory concerned shall be afforded such relief as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.    

C.  *Negotiable Instruments*  

1. As between enemies, no negotiable instrument made before the war shall be deemed to have become invalid by reason only of failure within the required time to present the instrument for acceptance or payment, or to give notice of non-acceptance or non-payment to drawers or endorsers, or to protest the instrument, nor by reason of failure to complete any formality during the war.  

2. Where the period within which a negotiable instrument should have been presented for acceptance or for payment, or within which notice of non-acceptance or non-payment should have been given to the drawer or endorser, or within which the instrument should have been protested, has elapsed during the war, and the party who should have presented or protested the instrument or have given notice of non-acceptance or non-payment has failed to do so during the war, a period of not less than three months from the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace signed this day shall be allowed within which presentation, notice of non-acceptance or non-payment, or protest may be made.  

3. If a person has, either before or during the war, incurred obligations under a negotiable instrument in consequence of an undertaking given to him by a person who has subsequently become an enemy, the latter shall remain liable to indemnify the former in respect of these obligations, notwithstanding the outbreak of war.    

D.  *Insurance and reinsurance contracts (other than life) which had not terminated before the date at which the parties became enemies*  

1. Contracts of Insurance shall be deemed not to have been dissolved by the fact of the parties becoming enemies, provided that the risk had attached before the date at which the parties became enemies, and the Insured had paid, before that date, all moneys owed by way of premium or consideration for effecting or keeping effective the Insurance in accordance with the Contract.  

2. Contracts of Insurance other than those remaining in force under the preceding clause shall be deemed not to have come into existence, and any moneys paid thereunder shall be returnable.  

3. Treaties and other Contracts of Reinsurance, save as hereinafter expressly provided, shall be deemed to have been determined as at the date the parties became enemies, and all cessions thereunder shall be cancelled with effect from that date. Provided that cessions in respect of voyage policies which had attached under a Treaty of Marine Reinsurance shall be deemed to have remained in full effect until their natural expiry in accordance with the terms and conditions on which the risk had been ceded.  

4. Contracts of Facultative Reinsurance, where the risk had attached and all moneys owed by way of premium or consideration for effecting or keeping effective the Reinsurance had been paid or set off *in* the customary manner, shall, unless the Reinsurance Contract otherwise provides, be deemed to have remained in full effect until the date at which the parties became enemies and to have been determined on that date. Provided that such Facultative Reinsurances in respect of voyage policies shall be deemed to have remained in full effect until their natural expiry in accordance with the terms and conditions on which the risk had been ceded. Provided further that Facultative Reinsurances in respect of a Contract of Insurance remaining in force under clause 1 above shall be deemed to have remained in full effect until the expiry of the original Insurance.  

5. Contracts of Facultative Reinsurance other than those dealt with in the preceding clause, and all Contracts of Excess of Loss Reinsurance on an “Excess of Loss Ratio” basis and of Hail Reinsurance (whether facultative or not), shall be deemed not to have come into existence, and any moneys paid thereunder shall be returnable.  

6. Unless the Treaty or other Contract of Reinsurance otherwise provides, premiums shall be adjusted on a *pro rata temporis* basis.  

7. Contracts of Insurance or Reinsurance (including cessions under Treaties of Reinsurance) shall be deemed not to cover losses or claims caused by belligerent action by either Power of which any of the parties was a national or by the Allies or Associates of such Power.  

8. Where an insurance has been transferred during the war from the original to another Insurer, or has been wholly reinsured, the transfer or reinsurance shall, whether effected voluntarily or by administrative or legislative action, be recognized and the liability of the original Insurer shall be deemed to have ceased as from the date of the transfer or reinsurance.  

9. Where there was more than one Treaty or other Contract of Reinsurance between the same two parties, there shall be an adjustment of accounts between them, and in order to establish a resulting balance there shall be brought into the accounts all balances (which shall include an agreed reserve for losses still outstanding) and all moneys which may be due from one party to the other under all such contracts or which may be returnable by virtue of any of the foregoing provisions.  

10. No interest shall be payable by any of the parties for any delay which, owing to the parties having become enemies, has occurred or may occur in the settlement of premiums or claims or balances of account.  

11. Nothing in this part of the present Protocol shall in any way prejudice or affect the rights given by Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace signed this day.    

E.  *Life insurance contracts*  Where an insurance has been transferred during the war from the original to another insurer or has been wholly reinsured, the transfer of reinsurance shall, if effected at the instance of the Japanese administrative or legislative authorities, be recognized, and the liability of the original insurer shall be deemed to have ceased as from the date of the transfer of reinsurance.  

F.  *Special provision*  For the purposes of the present Protocol, natural or juridical persons shall be regarded as enemies from the date when trading between them shall have become unlawful under laws, orders, or regulations to which such persons or the contracts were subject.

(c).  Japan doet afstand van alle rechten, titels en belangen verworven krachtens, en wordt ontslagen van alle verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit, de Overeenkomst tussen Duitsland en de Crediteurstaten van 20 Januari 1930, en de daarbij behorende Bijlagen, met inbegrip van de Trust-Overeenkomst, gedateerd 17 Mei 1930; het Verdrag van 20 Januari 1930 betreffende de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen; en de Statuten van de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen.

Het recht om gratie te verlenen, vonnissen te verzachten en zulke gevangenen voorwaardelijk in vrijheid te stellen, mag niet worden uitgeoefend dan krachtens een beslissing van de Regering of Regeringen, door welke het vonnis in elk afzonderlijk geval werd opgelegd, en op aanbeveling van Japan. Voor zover het personen betreft, die veroordeeld zijn door de Internationale Militaire Rechtbank voor het Verre Oosten, mag dat recht niet worden uitgeoefend dan krachtens een beslissing van de meerderheid van de Regeringen, vertegenwoordigd in die Rechtbank, en op aanbeveling van Japan.

(b).  In afwachting van de sluiting van het betreffende verdrag of de betreffende overeenkomst zal Japan gedurende een periode van vier jaar vanaf de datum, waarop dit Verdrag voor het eerst in werking treedt 

(1) elk der Geallieerde Mogendheden, haar onderdanen, producten en schepen toestaan 

(i) de behandeling op voet van meestbegunstigde natie met betrekking tot douanerechten, kosten, beperkingen en andere regelingen van of in verband met de in- en uitvoer van goederen;  

(ii) nationale behandeling met betrekking tot schepen, navigatie en ingevoerde goederen, en met betrekking tot natuurlijke- en rechtspersonen en hun belangen - waarbij een dergelijke behandeling alle aangelegenheden zal omvatten, welke betrekking hebben op het heffen en het innen van belastingen, het adiëren van de rechter, het sluiten en uitvoeren van contracten, recht op eigendom (lichamelijk en onlichamelijk), deelneming in rechtspersonen ingesteld krachtens de Japanse wet, en, in het algemeen, het leiden respectievelijk verrichten van alle soorten zaken en beroepswerkzaamheden;    

(2) waarborgen, dat de buitenlandse aan- en verkopen van Japanse staatshandelsondernemingen uitsluitend gebaseerd zullen zijn op commerciële overwegingen.     
(c).  Met betrekking tot elke aangelegenheid zal Japan echter slechts verplicht zijn een Geallieerde Mogendheid in die mate nationale behandeling of een behandeling van meestbegunstigde natie te verlenen, als de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid nationale behandeling of behandeling van de meestbegunstigde natie, al naar het geval zich voordoet, met betrekking tot diezelfde aangelegenheid aan Japan verleent. De wederkerigheid bedoeld in de voorgaande zin zal worden bepaald, in het geval van goederen, schepen en rechtspersonen van, en personen woonachtig in, enig niet tot het moederland behorend grondgebied van een Geallieerde Mogendheid, en in het geval van rechtspersonen van, en personen woonachtig in, enige staat of provincie van een Geallieerde Mogendheid, welke een bondsregering heeft, door de behandeling, welke Japan ten deel valt in zulk een gebied, staat of provincie.   
(d).  Bij de toepassing van dit artikel zal een discriminerende maatregel niet beschouwd worden als een afwijking van het toekennen van nationale behandeling of behandeling van meestbegunstigde natie, al naar het geval zich voordoet, indien zulk een maatregel gebaseerd is op een uitzondering, welke gewoonlijk wordt opgenomen in de handelsverdragen van de partij, die een dergelijke maatregel toepast, of op de noodzakelijkheid om de buitenlandse financiële toestand of betalingsbalans (uitgezonderd wat betreft schepen en navigatie) van die partij te beschermen, of op de noodzakelijkheid om haar wezenlijke veiligheidsbelangen te handhaven, en onder voorbehoud, dat een dergelijke maatregel in overeenstemming is met de omstandigheden en niet wordt toegepast op een willekeurige of onredelijke wijze.   
(e).  Japans verplichtingen krachtens dit Artikel zullen niet worden aangetast door het uitoefenen van enig Geallieerd recht krachtens Artikel 14 van dit Verdrag; evenmin zullen de bepalingen van dit Artikel beschouwd worden als een beperking te vormen van de verplichtingen, welke Japan krachtens Artikel 15 van dit Verdrag op zich neemt.   

### Artikel  13  

(a).  Japan zal met elk der Geallieerde Mogendheden, zodra één of meer van deze Mogendheden daartoe een verzoek doen, onverwijld onderhandelingen openen tot het sluiten van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten betreffende het internationale burgerlijke luchtvervoer.   
(b).  In afwachting van het sluiten van een dergelijke overeenkomst of dergelijke overeenkomsten zal Japan, gedurende een periode van vier jaar te rekenen vanaf de datum, waarop dit Verdag voor het eerst in werking treedt, een zodanige Mogendheid geen ongunstiger behandeling ten deel doen vallen met betrekking tot luchtverkeersrechten en -voorrechten dan die, welke worden uitgeoefend door één van die Mogendheden op de datum van bedoelde inwerkingtreding, en met betrekking tot de exploitatie en ontwikkeling van luchtlijnen aan iedereen volkomen gelijke gelegenheid bieden.   
(c).  In afwachting van het ogenblik, waarop Japan partij wordt bij het Verdrag inzake de Internationale Burgerlijke Luchtvaart in overeenstemming met Artikel 93 van dat Verdrag, zal Japan de bepalingen van dat Verdrag uitvoeren voorzover zij betrekking hebben op de internationale navigatie van vliegtuigen, en de normen, practijken en procedures, aanvaard als bijlagen bij het Verdrag, ten uitvoer leggen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Verdrag.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Aanspraken en eigendom

### Artikel  14  

(a).  Erkend wordt, dat Japan herstelbetalingen behoort te verrichten aan de Geallieerde Mogendheden voor de schade en het leed, dat het gedurende de oorlog heeft veroorzaakt. Niettemin wordt eveneens erkend, dat de middelen van Japan momenteel niet toereikend zijn om, indien het een levensvatbare economie wil handhaven, volledige herstelbetaling te verrichten voor alle zodanige schade en leed, en tegelijkertijd zijn andere verplichtingen na te komen. Daarom 

1. zal Japan onverwijld onderhandelingen openen met die Geallieerde Mogendheden, die zulks wensen, wier huidig grondgebied door Japanse strijdkrachten werd bezet en beschadigd, ten einde door de beschikbaarstelling van de diensten van het Japanse volk voor de productie, berging en ander werk ten behoeve van de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheden bij te dragen die landen schadeloos te stellen voor de kosten van het herstel van de aangerichte schade. Zulke regelingen zullen vermijden dat andere Geallieerde Mogendheden verdere aansprakelijkheden worden opgelegd, en in gevallen waar de bewerking van grondstoffen vereist is, zullen deze door de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheden geleverd worden, zodat Japan geen lasten zullen worden opgelegd op het gebied van de buitenlandse valuta.  

2. 

(I) Behoudens de bepalingen van onderstaand lid (II) zal elk der Geallieerde Mogendheden het recht hebben in beslag te nemen, terug te houden, te liquideren of op andere wijze te beschikken over alle eigendommen, rechten en. belangen van 

(a) Japan en Japanse onderdanen,  

(b) personen, die optreden voor of namens Japan of Japanse onderdanen, en  

(c) lichamen in eigendom van of bestuurd door Japan of Japanse onderdanen,   die op het ogenblik, waarop dit Verdrag voor het eerst in werking trad, onderworpen waren aan haar rechtsmacht. De eigendom, de rechten en belangen vermeld in dit lid omvatten tevens die eigendommen, rechten en belangen, die nu geblokkeerd zijn, genaast of in het bezit of onder bestuur van autoriteiten in Geallieerde Landen belast met het beheer van vijandelijk vermogen en die behoorden aan of gehouden of bestuurd werden namens een van de personen of lichamen genoemd onder (*a*), (*b*) of (*c*) hierboven, ten tijde dat zodanige bezittingen onder het beheer van zodanige autoriteiten kwamen.  

(II) Het volgende zal worden uitgezonderd van het recht vermeld in lid (I) hierboven: 

(i) eigendommen van Japanse natuurlijke personen, die tijdens de oorlog met toestemming van de betrokken Regering woonden op het grondgebied van een der Geallieerde Mogendheden, anders dan door Japan bezet grondgebied, behalve eigendom, gedurende de oorlog onderworpen aan beperkingen en niet ontheven van zodanige beperkingen met ingang van de datum, waarop dit Verdrag voor het eerst in werking treedt;  

(ii) alle onroerende goederen, meubilair en vaste inventaris in Japanse eigendom en gebruikt voor diplomatieke of consulaire doeleinden, en al het privé-meubilair en woninginstallaties en ander privé-eigendom, welke niet het karakter hebben van geldbelegging en die normaal nodig waren voor het doen functioneren van diplomatieke en consulaire diensten, in eigendom van Japans diplomatiek en consulair personeel;  

(iii) eigendom, behorend aan godsdienstige lichamen of particuliere liefdadige instellingen en uitsluitend gebruikt voor godsdienstige of liefdadige doeleinden;  

(iv) eigendom, rechten en belangen, die onder zijn jurisdictie gekomen zijn tengevolge van de hervatting van de handels- en financiële betrekkingen na 2 September 1945, tussen het betrokken land in Japan, behalve die, welke het gevolg zijn van transacties strijdig met de wetten van de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid;  

(v) verplichtingen van Japan of Japanse onderdanen, ieder recht, titel of belang ten aanzien van lichamelijke goederen, welke zich in Japan bevinden, belangen in ondernemingen georganiseerd volgens de Japanse wetten of alle documenten ten bewijze daarvan; onder voorwaarde, dat deze uitzondering alleen zal gelden voor verplichtingen van Japan en zijn onderdanen, welke luiden in Japanse valuta.    

(III) Eigendom als bedoeld in de uitzonderingen (i) tot en met (v) hierboven zal worden teruggegeven tegen betaling van een redelijke vergoeding voor onkosten gemaakt voor het bewaren en beheren ervan. Indien zodanige eigendom geliquideerd mocht zijn dan zal in plaats daarvan de opbrengst worden gerestitueerd.  

(IV) Het recht eigendom in beslag te nemen, terug te houden, te liquideren of er op andere wijze over te beschikken als bepaald in lid (I) hierboven zal worden uitgeoefend in overeenstemming met de wetten van de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid, en de eigenaar zal alleen die rechten hebben, welke hem door die wetten worden toegekend.  

(V) de Geallieerde Mogendheden stemmen erin toe Japanse handelsmerken en literaire en artistieke eigendomsrechten te behandelen op een wijze, welke voor Japan zo gunstig is als onder de in elk land bestaande omstandigheden mogelijk is.       
(b).  Behalve wanneer in dit Verdrag anders is bepaald doen de Geallieerde Mogendheden afstand van alle eisen tot schadevergoeding van de Geallieerde Mogendheden, andere vorderingen van de Geallieerde Mogendheden en haar onderdanen voortspruitende uit handelingen, verricht door Japan en zijn onderdanen in de loop van de oorlogvoering, en vorderingen van de Geallieerde Mogendheden voor directe militaire bezettingskosten.   

### Artikel  15  

(a).  Op een aanvrage, ingediend binnen negen maanden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag tussen Japan en de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid, zal Japan binnen zes maanden na de datum van zodanige aanvrage, de eigendom, lichamelijke en onlichamelijke, en alle rechten en belangen, van elke aard, in Japan, van iedere Geallieerde Mogendheid en haar onderdanen, welke eigendom, rechten en belangen zich in Japan bevonden op enig ogenblik tussen 7 December 1941 en 2 September 1945, tenzij de eigenaar ze uit eigener beweging van de hand heeft gedaan zonder dwang of bedrog, teruggeven. Deze eigendom zal worden teruggegeven vrij van alle lasten en kosten, waaraan hij tengevolge van de oorlog onderworpen mocht zijn, en zonder enige kosten voor de teruggave. Over eigendom, waarvan de teruggave niet wordt gevraagd door of namens de eigenaar of door zijn Regering binnen de voorgeschreven periode, kan door de Japanse Regering worden beschikt naar zij verkiest. In gevallen, waarin zodanige eigendom zich binnen Japan bevond op 7 December 1941 en niet kan worden teruggegeven of schade heeft opgelopen tengevolge van de oorlog, zal schadevergoeding verleend worden op voorwaarden, welke niet minder gunstig zullen zijn dan die als bepaald in de ontwerp-wet op de Schadevergoeding voor Geallieerde Eigendommen, goedgekeurd door het Japanse Kabinet op 13 Juli 1951.   
(b).  Met betrekking tot industriële eigendomsrechten, welke gedurende de oorlog zijn aangetast, zal Japan aan de Geallieerde Mogendheden en haar onderdanen voordelen blijven toekennen, welke niet minder zullen zijn dan die, welke tot dusverre werden toegekend krachtens de „Cabinet Orders” No. 309, in werking getreden op 1 September 1949, No. 12, in werking getreden op 28 Januari 1950 en No. 9, in werking getreden op 1 Februari 1950, alle als gewijzigd, mits die onderdanen dergelijke voordelen hebben aangevraagd binnen de in deze „Cabinet Orders” bepaalde termijnen.   
(c).  

(i) Japan erkent, dat de literaire en artistieke eigendomsrechten, welke op 6 December 1941 in Japan bestonden met betrekking tot gepubliceerde en ongepubliceerde werken van Geallieerde Mogendheden en haar onderdanen, sinds die datum bestendigd zijn en erkent die rechten, welke sinds die datum in Japan zijn ontstaan of zouden zijn ontstaan, indien er geen oorlog was geweest, door de werking van enig verdrag of enige overeenkomst, waarbij Japan op die datum partij was, ongeacht de vraag of zulke verdragen of overeenkomsten bij of sinds het uitbreken van de oorlog door de binnenlandse wetgeving in Japan of in de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheden waren vervallen of geschorst.  

(ii) Zonder dat de eigenaar van het recht daartoe een aanvraag behoeft in te dienen en zonder dat de betaling van een heffing of het voldoen aan een andere formaliteit noodzakelijk is, zal de periode van 7 December 1941 tot de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag tussen Japan en de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid niet worden gerekend tot de normale looptijd van dergelijke rechten; en die periode, vermeerderd met een periode van nog eens zes maanden, zal evenmin worden gerekend tot de periode, waarbinnen een letterkundig werk in het Japans moet zijn vertaald, teneinde de vertaalrechten in Japan te verkrijgen.     

### Artikel  16  

Teneinde uitdrukking te geven aan zijn verlangen een schadeloosstelling te verlenen aan die leden van de strijdkrachten van de Geallieerde Mogendheden, die als krijgsgevangenen van Japan buitensporige ontberingen hebben geleden, zal Japan zijn activa en die van zijn onderdanen in landen, die tijdens de oorlog onzijdig waren, of die met een van de Geallieerde Mogendheden in oorlog waren, of, naar zijn keuze, de tegenwaarde van zulke activa overmaken aan het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, dat zodanige activa zal liquideren en de op die wijze verkregen fondsen zal verdelen over de daartoe aangewezen nationale organen, ten gunste van vroegere krijgsgevangenen en hun gezinnen op een zodanige basis als bovengenoemd comité billijk zal oordelen. De categorieën activa, omschreven in Artikel 14 (*a*) 2 (II) (ii) tot en met (v) van dit Verdrag, zullen van overdraging worden uitgezonderd, evenals de activa van Japanse natuurlijke personen die op het ogenblik, waarop dit Verdrag voor het eerst in werking treedt, geen ingezetenen van Japan zijn. Ook wordt overeengekomen, dat de overdrachtsbepaling van dit Artikel niet van toepassing zal zijn op de 19.770 aandelen in de Bank voor Internationale Betalingen, welke thans het eigendom zijn van Japanse financiële instellingen.  

### Artikel  17  

(a).  Op verzoek van elk der Geallieerde Mogendheden zal de Japanse Regering herzien en wijzigen in overeenstemming met het internationale recht iedere beslissing of elk bevel van de Japanse prijzenhoven in zaken, waarbij eigendomsrechten betrokken waren van onderdanen van die Geallieerde Mogendheden, en zal afschriften overleggen van alle documenten, die de dossiers van deze zaken vormen, met inbegrip van de genomen beslissingen en uitgevaardigde bevelen. In iedere zaak, waarin uit een dergelijke herziening en wijziging blijkt, dat Japan tot teruggave verplicht is, zullen de bepalingen van Artikel 15 van toepassing zijn op de betrokken eigendom.   
(b).  De Japanse Regering zal die maatregelen nemen, welke noodzakelijk zijn om onderdanen van enige Geallieerde Mogendheid in staat te stellen op enig tijdstip binnen een jaar na het tijdstip, waarop dit Verdrag tussen Japan en de betrokken Geallieerde Mogendheid in werking treedt, aan de daartoe aangewezen Japanse autoriteiten enig vonnis geveld door een Japans hof tussen 7 December 1941 en de bovenbedoelde inwerkingtreding, ter herziening voor te leggen. Dit geldt voor elk rechtsgeding, waarin een dergelijk onderdaan niet in staat was zijn zaak op behoorlijke wijze naar voren te brengen, hetzij als eiser, hetzij als gedaagde. De Japanse Regering zal erop toezien, dat, indien een dergelijk onderdaan schade heeft geleden tengevolge van een zodanig vonnis, hij zal worden hersteld in de staat, waarin hij zich bevond vóór het vonnis werd uitgesproken, of hij zal op zodanige wijze worden schadeloos gesteld als onder de gegeven omstandigheden rechtvaardig en billijk zal zijn.   

### Artikel  18  

(a).  Erkend wordt, dat het intreden van de staat van oorlog geen afbreuk heeft gedaan aan de verplichting om geldschulden te betalen, welke voortspruiten uit verbintenissen en contracten (met inbegrip van die met betrekking tot obligaties), welke bestonden, en rechten, welke werden verworven, vóór het intreden van de staat van oorlog en welke verschuldigd zijn door de Regering of onderdanen van Japan aan de Regering of onderdanen van een van de Geallieerde Mogendheden aan de Regering of onderdanen van Japan. Evenmin zal het intreden van de staat van oorlog worden beschouwd als afbreuk te doen aan de verplichting om op zichzelf te beschouwen eisen tot schadevergoeding voor verlies of beschadiging van eigendommen of voor persoonlijk letsel of dood, ontstaan vóór het intreden van de staat van oorlog, en welke kunnen worden ingediend of opnieuw worden ingediend door de Regering van een van de Geallieerde Mogendheden bij de Japanse Regering, of door de Japanse Regering bij een van de Regeringen van de Geallieerde Mogendheden. De bepalingen van dit lid zullen geen afbreuk doen aan de rechten toegekend krachtens Artikel 14.   
(b).  Japan bevestigt zijn aansprakelijkheid voor de vooroorlogse buitenlandse schuld van de Japanse Staat en voor schulden van zedelijke lichamen, waarvan op een later tijdstip verklaard is, dat zij schulden waren van de Japanse Staat, en geeft uitdrukking aan zijn voornemen om zeer spoedig onderhandelingen te openen met zijn crediteuren met betrekking tot de hervatting van de betalingen op deze schulden; de onderhandelingen met betrekking tot andere vooroorlogse aanspraken en verplichtingen aan te moedigen; en dienovereenkomstig het overmaken van geldbedragen te vergemakkelijken.   

### Artikel  19  

(a).  Japan doet afstand van alle aanspraken van Japan en zijn onderdanen tegenover de Geallieerde Mogendheden en haar onderdanen, voortvloeiende uit de oorlog of uit handelingen verricht tengevolge van het bestaan van de staat van oorlog, en doet afstand van alle aanspraken, voortvloeiende uit de aanwezigheid, krijgsverrichtingen of handelingen van strijdkrachten of autoriteiten van een van de Geallieerde Mogendheden op Japans gebied vóór de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag.   
(b).  Het afstand doen van aanspraken als hierboven bedoeld omvat ook de aanspraken, voortvloeiende uit stappen ondernomen door enige Gealieerde Mogendheid met betrekking tot Japanse schepen tussen 1 September 1939 en het inwerkingtreden van dit Verdrag, evenals alle aanspraken en schulden ontstaan met betrekking tot Japanse krijgsgevangenen en geïnterneerde burgers in handen van de Geallieerde Mogendheden, maar omvat niet de Japanse aanspraken, welke uitdrukkelijk erkend zijn in de wetten van enige Geallieerde Mogendheid, afgekondigd na 2 September 1945.   
(c).  Op voorwaarde van wederkerigheid doet de Japanse Regering eveneens afstand van alle aanspraken (met inbegrip van schulden) tegenover Duitsland en Duitse onderdanen namens de Japanse Regering en Japanse onderdanen, met inbegrip van tussen de regeringen bestaande aanspraken en aanspraken voor verlies of beschadiging ontstaan tijdens de oorlog, met uitzondering echter van (*a*) aanspraken met betrekking tot contracten en rechten, aangegaan resp. verworven vóór 1 September 1939, en (b) aanspraken, voortvloeiende uit financiële en handelsbetrekkingen tussen Japan en Duitsland na 2 September 1945. Dit afstand doen doet geen afbreuk aan stappen, ondernomen in overeenstemming met de Artikelen 16 en 20 van dit Verdrag.   
(d).  Japan erkent de geldigheid van alles wat is gedaan en nagelaten gedurende de bezettingstijd krachtens of tengevolge van richtlijnen van de bezettingsautoriteiten of toegestaan door de op dat ogenblik geldende Japanse wetten, en zal geen stappen ondernemen, waardoor Geallieerde onderdanen onderworpen zouden worden aan burgerlijke of strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid, voortvloeiende uit een dergelijk handelen of nalaten.   

### Artikel  20  

Japan zal alle maatregelen nemen noodzakelijk om de liquidatie te verzekeren van Duitse activa in Japan als is of zal worden besloten door die mogendheden, die krachtens het Protocol van de handelingen van de Berlijnse Conferentie van 1945 gerechtigd zijn over die activa te beschikken, en zal in afwachting van de uiteindelijke beschikking over zodanige activa verantwoordelijk zijn voor hun bewaring en beheer.  

### Artikel  21  

Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van Artikel 25 van dit Verdrag zal China gerechtigd zijn de voordelen te genieten van de Artikelen 10 en 14 (*a*) 2; en Korea de voordelen van de Artikelen 2, 4, 9 en 12 van dit Verdrag.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Beslechting van Geschillen

### Artikel  22  

Indien naar de mening van enige Partij bij dit Verdrag er een geschil is gerezen betreffende de interpretatie of uitvoering van het Verdrag, dat niet beslecht wordt door het te verwijzen naar een speciaal „claims tribunal” of door andere overeengekomen middelen, zal het geschil op verzoek van een der daarbij betrokken partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan het Internationale Gerechtshof. Japan en die Geallieerde Mogendheden, die nog geen partij zijn bij het Statuut van het Internationale Gerechtshof, zullen op het ogenblik, waarop zij onderscheidenlijk dit Verdrag bekrachtigen en in overeenstemming met de resolutie van de Veiligheidsraad van de Verenigde Naties van 15 October 1946 bij de Griffie van het Hof een algemene verklaring neerleggen, waarbij zij zonder bijzondere overeenkomst de rechtsmacht van het Hof aanvaarden in het algemeen met betrekking tot alle geschillen van de aard als bedoeld in dit Artikel.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  23  

(a).  Dit Verdrag zal bekrachtigd worden door de Staten, die het ondertekenen, met inbegrip van Japan, en zal voor alle Staten, die het dan bekrachtigd hebben, in werking treden, wanneer de bekrachtigingsoorkonden nedergelegd zijn door Japan en door een meerderheid, met inbegrip van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika als voornaamste bezettingsmogendheid, van de volgende Staten nl. Australië, Canada, Ceylon, Frankrijk, Indonesië, het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, Nieuw-Zeeland, Pakistan, de Philippijnse Republiek, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika. Dit Verdrag zal voor iedere Staat die het daarna bekrachtigt, in werking treden op de dag van nederlegging van zijn bekrachtigingsoorkonde.   
(b).  Indien het Verdrag niet in werking is getreden binnen negen maanden na de dag van nederlegging van de bekrachtigingsoorkonde van Japan, kan iedere Staat, die het bekrachtigd heeft, het Verdrag tussen hem en Japan in werking doen treden door in die zin mededeling te doen aan de Regeringen van Japan en van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, niet later dan drie jaar na de nederlegging van Japans bekrachtigingsoorkonde.   

### Artikel  24  

Alle bekrachtigingsoorkonden zullen worden nedergelegd bij de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, die alle Staten, welke dit Verdrag ondertekenen, mededeling zal doen van iedere zodanige nederlegging, van de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag krachtens lid (*a*) van Artikel 23 en van alle mededelingen gedaan krachtens lid (*b*) van Artikel 23.  

### Artikel  25  

Ter fine van dit Verdrag zal onder de geallieerde Mogendheden verstaan worden de Staten, die met Japan in oorlog zijn, of iedere Staat, die vroeger deel uitmaakte van het grondgebied van een Staat genoemd in Artikel 23, mits in ieder afzonderlijk geval de betrokken Staat het Verdrag heeft ondertekend en bekrachtigd. Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van Artikel 21 zal dit Verdrag geen rechten, titels of voordelen toekennen aan enige Staat, die geen Geallieerde Mogendheid is volgens de definitie van dit Artikel; evenmin zal enig recht, titel of belang van Japan geacht worden te zijn verminderd of benadeeld door enige bepaling van het Verdrag ten gunste van een Staat, die geen Geallieerde Mogendheid is volgens de aldus gegeven definitie.  

### Artikel  26  

Japan zal bereid zijn met elke Staat, die de Verklaring der Verenigde Volkeren van 1 Januari 1942 heeft ondertekend of zijn instemming daarmede heeft betuigd, en die met Japan in oorlog is, of met elke Staat, die vroeger deel uitmaakte van het grondgebied van een Staat genoemd in Artikel 23, die dit Verdrag niet heeft ondertekend, een bilateraal Vredesverdrag te sluiten op dezelfde of hoofdzakelijk dezelfde voorwaarden als bepaald in dit Verdrag, maar deze verplichting van de zijde van Japan zal ophouden te bestaan drie jaren na het ogenblik, waarop dit Verdrag voor het eerst in werking treedt. Indien Japan een vredesregeling of een oorlogsschaderegeling mocht treffen met een Staat, waarbij aan die Staat grotere voordelen worden verleend dan welke bij dit Verdrag zijn bepaald, dan zullen diezelfde voordelen eveneens verleend worden aan de Partijen bij dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  27  

Dit Verdrag zal worden nedergelegd in het archief van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, die aan iedere Staat, die dit Verdrag heeft ondertekend, een gewaarmerkt afschrift zal doen toekomen.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekende Gevolmachtigden dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te San Francisco op de achtste dag van September 1951, in de Engelse, Franse en Spaanse taal, zijnde al deze teksten gelijkelijk authentiek, en in de Japanse taal.  

####PROTOCOL

De Ondergetekenden, daartoe behoorlijk gevolmachtigd, hebben overeenstemming bereikt omtrent de volgende bepalingen ter regeling van het vraagstuk van Contracten, Verjaringstermijnen en Handelspapieren, en het vraagstuk van Verzekeringscontracten, bij het herstel van de vrede met Japan: 
###Contracten, Verjaring en Handelspapieren

A. *Contracten* 

1. Elk contract, voor welks uitvoering contact noodzakelijk was tussen partijen bij dat contract, welke vijanden zijn geworden in de zin van deel F, zal, met inachtneming van de uitzonderingen vermeld in de alinea's 2 en 3 hieronder, beschouwd worden te zijn ontbonden met ingang van het tijdstip, waarop enige van de partijen bij dat contract vijanden werden. Een zodanige ontbinding maakt evenwel geen inbreuk op de bepalingen van de Artikelen 15 en 18 van het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag, noch zal zij enige partij bij het contract ontheffen van de verplichting, bedragen ontvangen als voorschotten of als betalingen op rekening en met betrekking tot welke zodanige partij geen tegenprestatie heeft geleverd, terug te betalen.  

2. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van bovenstaande alinea 1, zullen van ontbinding worden uitgesloten en zullen, zonder afbreuk te doen aan de rechten vervat in Artikel 14 van het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag, van kracht blijven die delen van contracten, welke van die contracten kunnen worden afgescheiden en voor welker uitvoering geen contact noodzakelijk is tussen partijen bij het contract, welke vijanden geworden zijn in de zin van deel F. In gevallen waar geen bepalingen van een contract kunnen worden afgescheiden zal het contract beschouwd worden als in zijn geheel te zijn ontbonden. Het voorgaande zal zijn onderworpen aan de toepassing van nationale wetten, besluiten of voorschriften uitgevaardigd door een partij, welke dit Protocol ondertekent en die krachtens genoemd Vredesverdrag een Geallieerde Mogendheid is, en rechtsbevoegdheid heeft over het contract of over een van de partijen bij het contract, en zal onderworpen zijn aan de bepalingen van het contract.  

3. Niets in deel A zal beschouwd worden transacties, welke op wettige wijze zijn uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met een contract tussen vijanden, ongeldig te maken, indien ze uitgevoerd zijn met de machtiging van de betrokken Regering, welke de Regering is van een van de ondertekenende Mogendheden van dit Protocol en krachtens genoemd Vredesverdrag een Geallieerde Mogendheid is.  

4. Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen zullen verzekerings- en herverzekeringscontracten behandeld worden in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de delen D. en E. van dit Protocol.    

B. *Verjaringstermijnen* 

1. Alle termijnen van verjaring of beperking van het recht om in rechte te verschijnen of conservatoire maatregelen te nemen ten aanzien van betrekkingen betreffende personen of eigendom, waarbij onderdanen betrokken zijn van de ondertekenende partijen, die tengevolge van de oorlogstoestand niet in staat waren gerechtelijke stappen te doen of te voldoen aan de formaliteiten, welke noodzakelijk waren om hun rechten te waarborgen, ongeacht de vraag, of deze termijnen begonnen vóór of na het uitbreken van de oorlog, zullen worden beschouwd als te zijn geschorst, voor de duur van de oorlog op Japans grondgebied enerzijds en anderzijds op het grondgebied van die ondertekenende partijen, die aan Japan op basis van wederkerigheid de voordelen van de bepalingen van dit lid toekennen. Deze termijnen zullen wederom beginnen te lopen op het ogenblik, waarop het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag in werking treedt. De bepalingen van dit lid zullen van toepassing zijn met betrekking tot termijnen, welke vastgesteld zijn voor het aanbieden van coupons of dividendbewijzen of voor het ter betaling aanbieden van effecten, welke zijn uitgeloot of welke op enige andere grond betaalbaar zijn, mits met betrekking tot zodanige coupons, dividendbewijzen of effecten de termijn wederom begint te lopen op de datum, waarop het geld voor de betaling aan de houder van de coupon, het dividendbewijs of het effect beschikbaar wordt gesteld.  

2. In gevallen waar wegens het nalaten van enige handeling of het niet voldoen aan enige formaliteit gedurende de oorlog executieve maatregelen genomen zijn op Japans grondgebied ten nadele van een onderdaan van een van de ondertekenende Mogendheden, die krachtens genoemd Vredesverdrag een Geallieerde Mogendheid is, zal de Japanse Regering de rechten herstellen, welke nadelig zijn beïnvloed. Indien een dergelijk herstel onmogelijk is of onbillijk zou zijn, dan zal de Japanse Regering er op toezien, dat de onderdaan van de betrokken ondertekenende partij een zodanige schadeloosstelling zal krijgen als onder de geldende omstandigheden rechtvaardig en billijk zal zijn.    

C. *Handelspapier* 

1. In de betrekkingen tussen vijanden zal geen enkel handelspapier gecreëerd vóór de oorlog als niet meer geldig beschouwd worden, alleen op grond van het feit, dat het papier niet binnen de vereiste termijn ter acceptatie of betaling is aangeboden, mededeling is gedaan aan trekkers of endossanten van non-acceptering of non-betaling of het papier geprotesteerd is, noch tengevolge van het feit, dat niet is voldaan aan enige formaliteit gedurende de oorlog.  

2. In die gevallen, waarin de termijn, waarbinnen een handelspapier ter acceptatie of betaling aangeboden had moeten worden, of waarbinnen mededeling van non-acceptatie of non-betaling gedaan had moeten worden aan de trekker of endossant, of waarbinnen het papier geprotesteerd had moeten zijn, tijdens de oorlog is afgelopen, en de partij, die het papier had moeten aanbieden of protesteren of mededeling had moeten doen van non-acceptatie of nonbetaling, zulks tijdens de oorlog niet heeft gedaan, dan zal een termijn van niet minder dan drie maanden worden toegestaan, te rekenen vanaf het in werking treden van het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag, waarbinnen aanbieding, mededeling van non-acceptatie of non-betaling, of het protesteren alsnog kan geschieden.  

3. Indien een persoon, hetzij vóór of na de oorlog, verplichtingen op zich heeft genomen krachtens een handelspapier ten gevolge van een overeenkomst met hem aangegaan door een persoon, die vervolgens een vijand is geworden, zal deze laatste, ondanks de opening der vijandelijkheden, gehouden zijn de eerste schadeloos te stellen voor de gevolgen, voortvloeiende uit zijn verplichtingen.    

D. *Verzekerings- en herverzekeringscontracten (andere dan met betrekking tot het leven), die niet af gelopen waren voor de datum, waarop partijen vijanden werden* 

1. Verzekeringscontracten zullen beschouwd worden niet te zijn ontbonden door het feit, dat partijen vijanden geworden zijn, mits het risico is ingegaan vóór de datum, waarop partijen vijanden werden en mits de verzekerde vóór die datum alle bedragen betaald heeft, die hij verschuldigd was uit hoofde van premies of voor het tot stand brengen of in stand houden van de verzekering in overeenstemming met het contract.  

2. Verzekeringscontracten andere dan die, welke krachtens voorgaande clausule van kracht blijven, zullen beschouwd worden als niet te zijn ontstaan, en alle bedragen, welke krachtens zodanige contracten zijn betaald, zullen moeten worden gerestitueerd.  

3. Verdragen en andere contracten van herverzekering, behalve als hierna uitdrukkelijk bepaald, zullen beschouwd worden als te zijn beëindigd op de datum, waarop partijen vijanden werden, en alle herverzekeringsposten zullen met ingang van die datum geannuleerd worden. Mits herverzekeringsposten met betrekking tot polissen voor een bepaalde reis, die ingegaan waren krachtens een Verdrag betreffende Zee Verzekering, beschouwd zullen worden volledig van kracht te zijn gebleven tot hun normale afloopdatum in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden, waarop het risico was overgedragen.  

4. Contracten van facultatieve herverzekering, waarbij het risico was ingegaan en alle bedragen verschuldigd uit hoofde van premies of voor het tot stand brengen of in stand houden van de herverzekering waren betaald of gecompenseerd op de gebruikelijke wijze, zullen, tenzij het herverzekeringscontract anders bepaalt, beschouwd worden volledig van kracht te zijn gebleven tot aan de datum, waarop partijen vijanden zijn geworden, en op die datum te zijn beëindigd. Onder voorwaarde, dat zodanige facultatieve herverzekeringen met betrekking tot polissen voor verzekering van één reis, beschouwd zullen worden krachtens bovenstaande clausule 1 volledig van kracht te zijn gebleven tot hun normale afloopdatum in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden, waarop het risico was overgedragen. Eveneens onder voorwaarde, dat facultatieve herverzekeringen met betrekking tot een verzekeringscontract, dat van kracht blijft krachtens clausule 1 hierboven, beschouwd zal worden volledig van kracht te zijn gebleven tot aan de afloopdatum van de oorspronkelijke verzekering.  

5. Contracten van facultatieve herverzekering, andere dan die bedoeld in de voorgaande clausule, en alle contracten van herverzekering in de vorm van schade-excedent-herverzekering op „excess of loss ratio” basis of van hagelschadeverzekering (al of niet facultatief) zullen beschouwd worden als niet te zijn gesloten en alle bedragen betaald krachtens dergelijke contracten dienen te worden gerestitueerd.  

6. Tenzij het Verdrag of ander herverzekeringscontract anders bepaalt, zullen premies vereffend worden op een „pro rata temporis”-basis.  

7. Verzekerings- of herverzekeringscontracten( met inbegrip van herverzekeringsposten krachtens Herverzekeringsverdragen) zullen beschouwd worden niet de verliezen of eisen tot schadevergoeding te dekken veroorzaakt door oorlogshandelingen door elk der mogendheden, waarvan één der partijen een onderdaan was of door de Geallieerden of Geassocieerden van een dergelijke mogenheid.  

8. Indien gedurende de oorlog een verzekering is overgeboekt van de oorspronkelijke verzekeraar naar een andere verzekeraar of geheel herverzekerd is, dan zal deze overboeking of herverzekering, hetzij dat deze vrijwillig tot stand is gekomen of tengevolge van administratieve of wetgevende maatregelen, erkend worden en de aansprakelijkheid van de oorspronkelijke verzekeraar zal beschouwd worden te zijn opgehouden met ingang van de datum van de overboeking of herverzekering.  

9. Indien er tussen twee dezelfde partijen meer dan één verdrag of ander herverzekeringscontract bestond, dan zal er tussen hen een verrekening plaats vinden en, teneinde een eindsaldo vast te stellen, zal hierbij rekening worden, gehouden met alle saldi (met inbegrip van een overeengekomen reserve voor nog uitstaande verliezen) en alle gelden, welke de ene partij aan de andere verschuldigd is krachtens alle zodanige contracten of die, welke moeten worden terugbetaald krachtens enige van de voorgaande bepalingen.  

10. Er zal geen rente verschuldigd zijn door één van de partijen voor enige vertraging, welke ontstaan mocht zijn of nog ontstaan zal tengevolge van het feit, dat partijen vijanden geworden zijn, met betrekking tot de verrekening van premies of vorderingen of saldi van rekeningen.  

11. Niets in dit deel van dit Protocol zal op enige wijze afbreuk doen aan. of beïnvloeden, de rechten toegekend krachtens Artikel 14 van het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag.    

E. *Levensverzekeringscontracten* Indien gedurende de oorlog een verzekering is overgeboekt van de oorspronkelijke verzekeraar naar een andere verzekeraar of geheel herverzekerd is, dan zal deze overboeking of herverzekering, indien tot stand gekomen op verzoek van de Japanse administratieve of wetgevende autoriteiten, worden erkend en de aansprakelijkheid van de oorspronkelijke verzekeraar zal beschouwd worden te zijn opgehouden met ingang van de datum van de overboeking of herverzekering.  

F. *Bijzondere bepaling* Ter fine van dit Protocol zullen natuurlijke- of rechtspersonen als vijanden beschouwd worden met ingang van de datum, waarop de handel tussen hen onwettig geworden is krachtens wetten, besluiten of voorschriften, waaraan zodanige personen of de contracten onderworpen waren.   
###Slotbepaling

Dit Protocol staat open ter ondertekening door Japan en iedere Staat, die heden het Vredesverdrag met Japan heeft ondertekend en zal, met betrekking tot aangelegenheden, die het behandelt, de betrekkingen beheersen tussen Japan en elk van de andere Staten, die dit Protocol hebben ondertekend met ingang van de datum, waarop Japan en die Staat beide gebonden zijn door genoemd Vredesverdrag. Dit Protocol zal worden nedergelegd in het archief van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, die elke ondertekenende Staat een gewaarmerkt afschrift ervan zal doen toekomen. TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekende gevolmachtigden dit Protocol hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te San Francisco, de achtste dag van September 1951, in de Engelse, Franse en Spaanse taal, zijnde al deze talen gelijkelijk authentiek, en in de Japanse taal.   

####VERKLARING

Met betrekking tot het heden ondertekende Vredesverdrag legt de Japanse Regering de volgende verklaring af:
