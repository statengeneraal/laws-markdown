####Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal

Preamble The Parties to this Convention, Aware of the risk of damage to human health and the environment caused by hazardous wastes and other wastes and the transboundary movement thereof, Mindful of the growing threat to human health and the environment posed by the increased generation and complexity, and transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, Mindful also that the most effective way of protecting human health and the environment from the dangers posed by such wastes is the reduction of their generation to a minimum in terms of quantity and/or hazard potential, Convinced that States should take necessary measures to ensure that the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes including their transboundary movement and disposal is consistent with the protection of human health and the environment whatever the place of their disposal, Noting that States should ensure that the generator should carry out duties with regard to the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes in a manner that is consistent with the protection of the environment, whatever the place of disposal, Fully recognizing that any State has the sovereign right to ban the entry or disposal of foreign hazardous wastes and other wastes in its territory, Recognizing also the increasing desire for the prohibition of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in other States, especially developing countries, Convinced that hazardous wastes and other wastes should, as far as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient management, be disposed of in the State where they were generated, Aware also that transboundary movements of such wastes from the State of their generation to any other State should be permitted only when conducted under conditions which do not endanger human health and the environment, and under conditions in conformity with the provisions of this Convention, Considering that enhanced control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes will act as an incentive for their environmentally sound management and for the reduction of the volume of such transboundary movement, Convinced that States should take measures for the proper exchange of information on and control of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes from and to those States, Noting that a number of international and regional agreements have addressed the issue of protection and preservation of the environment with regard to the transit of dangerous goods. Taking into account the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo Guidelines and Principles for the Environmentally Sound Management of Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by decision 14/30 of 17 June 1987, the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (formulated in 1957 and updated biennially), relevant recommendations, declarations, instruments and regulations adopted within the United Nations system and the work and studies done within other international and regional organizations, Mindful of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the World Charter for Nature adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its thirty-seventh session (1982) as the rule of ethics in respect of the protection of the human environment and the conservation of natural resources, Affirming that States are responsible for the fulfilment of their international obligations concerning the protection of human health and protection and preservation of the environment, and are liable in accordance with international law, Recognizing that in the case of a material breach of the provisions of this Convention or any protocol thereto the relevant international law of treaties shall apply, Aware of the need to continue the development and implementation of environmentally sound low-waste technologies, recycling options, good house-keeping and management systems with a view to reducing to a minimum the generation of hazardous wastes and other wastes, Aware also of the growing international concern about the need for stringent control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, and of the need as far as possible to reduce such movement to a minimum, Concerned about the problem of illegal transboundary traffic in hazardous wastes and other wastes, Taking into account also the limited capabilities of the developing countries to manage hazardous wastes and other wastes, Recognizing the need to promote the transfer of technology for the sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes produced locally, particularly to the developing countries in accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Guidelines and decision 14/16 of the Governing Council of UNEP on Promotion of the transfer of environmental protection technology, Recognizing also that hazardous wastes and other wastes should be transported in accordance with relevant international conventions and recommendations, Convinced also that the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes should be permitted only when the transport and the ultimate disposal of such wastes is environmentally sound, and Determined to protect, by strict control, human health and the environment against the adverse effects which may result from the generation and management of hazardous wastes and other wastes, Have agreed as follows:

####Categories of wastes requiring Special Consideration

|
|
| Y46  | Wastes collected from households  |
| Y47  | Residues arising from the incineration of household wastes  |

### ANNEX  III  

####List of Hazardous Characteristics

|
|
|  *UW Class*   <sup> *   Corresponds to the hazard classification system included in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (ST/SG/ AC.10/l/Rev.5, United Nations, New York, 1988).    </sup> |  *Code*   |  *Characteristics*   |
| 1  | H1  | Explosive  An explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.  |
| 3  | H3  | Flammable liquids  The word "flammable" has the same meaning as "inflammable". Flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example, paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5°C, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6° C, open-cup test. (Since the results of open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such differences would be within the spirit of this definition.)  <sup> 1)   Redactie: Deze zin komt alleen in de Engelse tekst voor.    </sup> |
| 4.1  | H4.1  | Flammable solids  Solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.  |
| 4.2  | H4.2  | Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion  Substances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or to heating up on contact with air, and being then liable to catch fire.  |
| 4.3  | H4.3  | Substances or wastes which, in contact with water emit flammable gases  Substances or wastes which,by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.  |
| 5.1  | H5.1  | Oxidizing  Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding oxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other materials.  |
| 5.2  | H5.2  | Organic Peroxides  Organic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent -0-0-structure are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.  |
| 6.1  | H6.1  | Poisonous (Acute)  Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.  |
| 6.2  | H6.2  | Infectious substances  Substances or wastes containing viable micro organisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.  |
| 8  | H8  | Corrosives  Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or, in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.  |
| 9  | H10  | Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water  Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous quantities.  |
| 9  | H11  | Toxic (Delayed or chronic)  |
| --- | --- | Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.  |
| 9  | H12  | Ecotoxic  Substances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/or toxic effects upon biotic systems.  |
| 9  | H13  | Capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another material, e.g., leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.  |

### *Tests* 

The potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not exist. Further research is necessary in order to develop means to characterise potential hazards posed to man and/or the environment by these wastes. Standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. Many countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in Annex I, in order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex.

in het bijzonder in ontwikkelingslanden, worden verboden, Ervan overtuigd dat gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen moeten worden verwijderd in de Staat waar zij zijn geproduceerd, voor zover verenigbaar met een milieuhygiënisch verantwoord en doelmatig beheer, Zich er voorts van bewust dat grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van dergelijke afvalstoffen uit de Staat waar zij zijn geproduceerd naar een andere Staat slechts zou moeten worden toegestaan wanneer deze geschiedt onder omstandigheden die geen gevaar voor de gezondheid van de mens en voor het milieu opleveren, en onder voorwaarden die in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, Overwegend dat uitgebreidere maatregelen ter beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen bevorderlijk zullen zijn voor een milieuhygiënisch verantwoord beheer en voor een vermindering van de omvang van deze grensoverschrijdende overbrenging, Ervan overtuigd dat Staten maatregelen moeten nemen voor een behoorlijke uitwisseling van gegevens over en voor een behoorlijke beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen uit en naar die Staten, Erop wijzend dat in een aantal internationale en regionale overeenkomsten het onderwerp milieubescherming en -behoud in verband met het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen wordt behandeld, Rekening houdend met de Verklaring van de Conferentie der Verenigde Naties inzake het Leefmilieu (Stockholm, 1972), de Richtlijnen en Beginselen van Kairo voor Milieuhygiënisch Verantwoord Beheer van Gevaarlijke Afvalstoffen, aangenomen door de Beheersraad van het Milieuprogramma der Verenigde Naties (UNEP) bij besluit 14/30 van 17 juni 1987, de Aanbevelingen van de Commissie van Deskundigen der Verenigde Naties inzake het Vervoer van Gevaarlijke Stoffen (opgesteld in 1957 en iedere twee jaar bijgewerkt), ter zake dienende aanbevelingen, verklaringen, akten en regelingen, aangenomen in het kader van het stelsel der Verenigde Naties, en werk en studies verricht in het kader van andere internationale en regionale organisaties, Indachtig de geest, de beginselen, de doelstellingen en de functies van het Wereldnatuurhandvest, aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties tijdens haar zevenendertigste zitting (1982) als ethische code aangaande de bescherming van het leefmilieu en het behoud der natuurlijke hulpbronnen, Bevestigend dat Staten verantwoordelijk zijn voor het nakomen van hun internationale verplichtingen aangaande de bescherming van de gezondheid van de mens en de bescherming en het behoud van het milieu, en aansprakelijk zijn in overeenstemming met het internationale recht, Erkennende dat, in geval van een ernstige schending van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van een protocol bij dit Verdrag, het desbetreffende internationale verdragenrecht van toepassing is, Zich bewust van de noodzaak de ontwikkeling en toepassing van milieuhygiënisch verantwoorde technologieën waarbij weinig afval ontstaat, van mogelijkheden van hergebruik, van goede systemen voor de omvang met en het beheer van afvalstoffen, voort te zetten teneinde de produktie van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen tot een minimum terug te brengen, Zich tevens bewust van de groeiende internationale aandacht voor de noodzaak van een strengere beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen, en van de noodzaak deze overbrenging voor zover mogelijk tot een minimum terug te brengen, Bezorgd over het probleem van onrechtmatige grensoverschrijdende handel in gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen, Voorts het beperkte vermogen van ontwikkelingslanden tot het beheer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen in aanmerking nemend, De noodzaak erkennend van het bevorderen van de overdracht van technologie voor een verantwoord beheer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen die plaatselijk worden geproduceerd, met name aan de ontwikkelingslanden, in de geest van de Richtlijnen van Kairo en besluit 14/16 van de Beheersraad van het UNEP inzake de bevordering van de overdracht van technologie op het gebied van de milieubescherming, Tevens erkennend dat gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen moeten worden vervoerd in overeenstemming met ter zake dienende verdragen en aanbevelingen, Er voorts van overtuigd dat de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen alleen moet worden toegestaan wanneer het vervoer en de uiteindelijke verwijdering van die afvalstoffen milieuhygiënisch verantwoord zijn, en Vastbesloten door strenge beheersing de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu te beschermen tegen de mogelijke nadelige gevolgen van de produktie en het beheer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en andere afvalstoffen, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

1.  De Staat van uitvoer doet schriftelijk mededeling aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Staten van iedere voorgenomen grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen, door tussenkomst van de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat van uitvoer, of eist dat de producent of de exporteur hiervan op deze wijze mededeling doet. Deze mededeling bevat de in Bijlage V A genoemde verklaringen en gegevens, geschreven in een voor de Staat van invoer aanvaardbare taal. Per betrokken Staat hoeft slechts één mededeling te worden verzonden.   
2.  De Staat van invoer stuurt de mededeler een schriftelijk antwoord, waarin hij, al dan niet op bepaalde voorwaarden, met de overbrenging instemt, of toestemming voor de overbrenging weigert, dan wel om aanvullende gegevens verzoekt. Een afschrift van het definitieve antwoord van de Staat van invoer wordt gezonden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn.   
3.  De Staat van uitvoer staat de producent of de exporteur niet toe de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging aan te vangen totdat hij er een schriftelijke bevestiging van heeft ontvangen dat: 

a) de mededeler de schriftelijke instemming van de Staat van invoer heeft ontvangen; en  

b) de mededeler bevestiging van de Staat van invoer heeft ontvangen van het bestaan van een contract tussen de exporteur en de verwijderaar dat bepalingen bevat voor een milieuhygiënisch verantwoord beheer van de desbetreffende afvalstoffen.     
4.  Iedere Staat van doorvoer die Partij is stuurt de mededeler onmiddellijk bevestiging van ontvangst van de mededeling. Hij kan de mededeler vervolgens schriftelijk, binnen zestig dagen, zijn antwoord geven, waarin hij, al dan niet op bepaalde voorwaarden, met de overbrenging instemt, of toestemming voor de overbrenging weigert, dan wel om aanvullende gegevens verzoekt. De Staat van uitvoer staat niet toe dat een aanvang met de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging wordt gemaakt totdat hij de schriftelijke instemming van de Staat van doorvoer heeft ontvangen. Indien een Partij echter op enig tijdstip besluit geen schriftelijke instemming vooraf te eisen, hetzij in het algemeen hetzij op bepaalde voorwaarden, voor de doorvoer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen die het voorwerp van grensoverschrijdende overbrenging zijn, of zijn vereisten dienaangaande wijzigt, stelt hij de andere Partijen onmiddellijk van dit besluit in kennis ingevolge artikel 13. In dit laatste geval kan de Staat van uitvoer, indien deze geen antwoord heeft ontvangen binnen zestig dagen nadat de Staat van doorvoer een bepaalde mededeling heeft ontvangen, toestaan dat de uitvoer dóór de Staat van doorvoer geschiedt.   
5.  In het geval van een grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van afvalstoffen die wettelijk als gevaarlijke afvalstoffen zijn omschreven of worden beschouwd: 

a) door alleen de Staat van uitvoer, zijn de vereisten van het negende lid van dit artikel die van toepassing zijn op de importeur of de verwijderaar en op de Staat van invoer mutatis mutandis van toepassing op respectievelijk de exporteur en de Staat van uitvoer;  

b) door alleen de Staat van invoer, of door de Staten van in- en doorvoer die Partij zijn, zijn de vereisten van het eerste, derde, vierde en zesde lid van dit artikel die van toepassing zijn op de exporteur en de Staat van uitvoer mutatis mutandis van toepassing op respectievelijk de importeur of de verwijderaar en de Staat van invoer; of  

c) door alleen een Staat van doorvoer die Partij is, zijn de bepalingen van het vierde lid op deze Staat van toepassing.     
6.  De Staat van uitvoer kan, onder voorbehoud van de schriftelijke instemming van de betrokken Staten, de producent of de exporteur toestaan een algemene mededeling te gebruiken wanneer gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen die dezelfde fysische en chemische eigenschappen hebben regelmatig naar dezelfde verwijderaar worden vervoerd langs hetzelfde douanekantoor van uitgang van de Staat van uitvoer, langs hetzelfde douanekantoor van binnenkomst van de Staat van invoer en, in het geval van doorvoer, langs dezelfde douanekantoren van binnenkomst en uitgang van de Staat of Staten van doorvoer.   
7.  De betrokken Staten kunnen hun schriftelijke instemming met het gebruik van een algemene mededeling zoals bedoeld in het zesde lid afhankelijk stellen van de verstrekking van bepaalde gegevens, zoals de exacte hoeveelheden of periodieke lijsten van te vervoeren gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen.   
8.  De algemene mededeling en de schriftelijke instemming bedoeld in het zesde en zevende lid kunnen betrekking hebben op meerdere zendingen van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen gedurende een tijdvak van ten hoogste twaalf maanden.   
9.  De Partijen eisen dat iedere persoon die zich belast met een grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen het vervoersdocument ondertekent hetzij bij de aflevering, hetzij bij de ontvangst van de afvalstoffen in kwestie. Zij eisen tevens dat de verwijderaar zowel de exporteur als de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat van uitvoer op de hoogte stelt van de ontvangst door de verwijderaar van de afvalstoffen in kwestie en, te zijner tijd, van de voltooiing van de verwijdering zoals beschreven in de mededeling. Indien deze gegevens niet worden ontvangen in de Staat van uitvoer, doet de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat van uitvoer of de exporteur hiervan mededeling aan de Staat van invoer.   
10.  De mededeling en het antwoord die in dit artikel worden vereist, worden toegezonden aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Partijen of aan een daarvoor geschikte overheidsinstantie in het geval van Staten die geen Partij zijn.   
11.  Iedere grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen wordt gedekt door een verzekering, borg of een andere garantie, te bepalen door de Staat van invoer of een Staat van doorvoer die Partij is.   

### Artikel  7  

####Grensoverschrijdende overbrenging vanuit een Partij via Staten die geen Partij zijn

e) die leidt tot opzettelijke verwijdering (bijvoorbeeld storting) van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen in strijd met dit Verdrag en met de algemene beginselen van het internationale recht, als sluikhandel beschouwd.     
2.  In het geval van een grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen die als sluikhandel wordt beschouwd op grond van gedragingen van de exporteur of de producent, draagt de Staat van uitvoer er zorg voor dat de afvalstoffen in kwestie; 

a) door de exporteur of de producent of, indien noodzakelijk, door die Staat zelf, worden teruggebracht naar de Staat van uitvoer, dan wel, indien dit niet mogelijk is,  

b) op een andere wijze worden verwijderd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag,   binnen dertig dagen vanaf het tijdstip waarop de Staat van uitvoer op de hoogte is gesteld van de sluikhandel, of binnen een ander tijdvak overeengekomen door de betrokken Staten. Geen van de betrokken Partijen verzet zich tegen, belemmert of verhindert de terugkeer van die afvalstoffen naar de Staat van uitvoer.   
3.  In het geval van een grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen of andere afvalstoffen die als sluikhandel wordt beschouwd op grond van gedragingen van de importeur of de verwijderaar, draagt de Staat van invoer er zorg voor dat de afvalstoffen in kwestie door de importeur of de verwijderaar of, indien noodzakelijk, door die Staat zelf, op milieuhygiënisch verantwoorde wijze worden verwijderd binnen dertig dagen vanaf het tijdstip waarop de sluikhandel onder de aandacht van de Staat van invoer is gekomen of binnen een ander tijdvak overeengekomen door de betrokken Staten. De betrokken Partijen werken, voor zover noodzakelijk, samen om de afvalstoffen op milieuhygiënisch verantwoorde wijze te verwijderen.   
4.  In gevallen waarin het niet mogelijk is de exporteur of de producent dan wel de importeur of de verwijderaar voor de sluikhandel verantwoordelijk te stellen, dragen de betrokken Partijen of andere Partijen, naar gelang van de omstandigheden, er in samenwerking zorg voor dat de afvalstoffen in kwestie zo spoedig mogelijk op milieuhygiënisch verantwoorde wijze worden verwijderd, hetzij in de Staat van uitvoer, hetzij in de Staat van invoer, of elders, naar gelang van de omstandigheden.   
5.  Iedere Partij voert passende nationale/binnenlandse wetgeving in ter voorkoming en bestraffing van sluikhandel. De Partijen werken samen teneinde de doelstellingen van dit artikel te verwezenlijken.

### BIJLAGE  III  

####Lijst van gevaarlijke eigenschappen

|
|
|  *VN-klasse*   <sup> *   Correspondeert met het gevarenclassificatiesysteem dat is opgenomen in de Aanbevelingen van de Verenigde Naties inzake het Vervoer van Gevaarlijke Stoffen (ST/SG/AC.10/l/Rev.5, Verenigde Naties, New York, 1988).    </sup> | --- | --- |
| 1  | *Code* H1  |  *Eigenschappen*   Ontplofbaar  Een ontplofbare stof of afvalstof is een vaste of vloeibare stof of afvalstof (of een mengsel van stoffen of afvalstoffen) die op zichzelf in staat is door een chemische reactie gas te produceren bij een zodanige temperatuur, onder een zodanige druk en met een zodanige snelheid dat schade aan de omgeving wordt veroorzaakt.  |
| 3  | H3  | Brandbare vloeistoffen  Brandbare vloeistoffen zijn vloeistoffen, of mengsels van vloeistoffen, of vloeistoffen die vaste stoffen bevatten in opgeloste of zwevende toestand (bijvoorbeeld verven, vernissen, lakken enz., echter met uitzondering van stoffen of afvalstoffen die op andere wijze zijn geclassificeerd op grond van hun gevaarlijke eigenschappen), die een brandbare damp ontwikkelen bij temperaturen niet hoger dan 60,5° C bij een proef volgens de gesloten-cupmethode, of niet hoger dan 65,6° C bij een proef volgens de open-cupmethode. (Aangezien de resultaten van proeven volgens de open- en de gesloten-cupmethode niet strikt te vergelijken zijn, en zelfs individuele resultaten van dezelfde proef vaak verschillen, zouden regelingen waarin wordt afgeweken van bovengenoemde temperaturen teneinde rekening te houden met deze verschillen, passen in de geest van deze begripsomschrijving).  |
| 4.1  | H4.1  | Brandbare vaste stoffen  Vaste stoffen, of vaste afvalstoffen, niet zijnde die stoffen die als ontplofbaar zijn geklasseerd, die onder omstandigheden die zich tijdens het vervoer voordoen, gemakkelijk vlam kunnen vatten, of door wrijving brand kunnen veroorzaken of bevorderen.  |
| 4.2  | H4.2  | Voor zelfontbranding vatbare stoffen of afvalstoffen  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die vatbaar zijn voor spontane verhitting onder gewone omstandigheden die zich tijdens het vervoer voordoen, of voor verhitting bij aanraking met lucht, en die vervolgens vatbaar zijn voor ontbranding.  |
| 4.3  | H4.3  | Stoffen of afvalstoffen die bij aanraking met water brandbare gassen ontwikkelen  S toffen of afvalstoffen die, door interactie met water, spontaan brandbaar kunnen worden of brandbare gassen kunnen ontwikkelen in gevaarlijke hoeveelheden.  |
| 5.1  | H5.1  | Oxyderend werkend  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die van nature niet noodzakelijk brandbaar zijn, maar die, in het algemeen door afgifte van zuurstof, de ontbranding van andere materialen kunnen veroorzaken of bevorderen.  |
| 5.2  | H5.2  | Organische peroxyden  Organische stoffen of afvalstoffen die de tweewaardige -0-0-structuur bevatten, zijn thermisch onstabiele stoffen die exotherme, zichzelf versnellende ontleding kunnen ondergaan.  |
| 6.1  | H6.1  | Giftig (Acuut)  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die de dood of ernstig letsel kunnen veroorzaken of de gezondheid van de mens kunnen schaden, indien ze worden ingeslikt of ingeademd, of door aanraking met de huid.  |
| 6.2  | H6.2  | Gevaar voor besmetting opleverende stoffen  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die levensvatbare microorganismen of hun toxinen bevatten, waarvan bekend is of wordt vermoed dat zij ziekte veroorzaken in dieren of mensen.  |
| 8  | H8  | Bijtende stoffen  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die, door chemische werking, ernstige schade zullen veroorzaken wanneer zij in aanraking komen met levend weefsel, of die, in geval van lekkage, andere goederen of het vervoermiddel ernstig zullen beschadigen, of zelfs vernietigen; ze kunnen ook andere gevaren veroorzaken.  |
| 9  | H10  | Het vrijkomen van toxische gassen bij aanraking met lucht of water  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die, door interactie met lucht of water, toxische gassen kunnen ontwikkelen in gevaarlijke hoeveelheden.  |
| 9  | H11  | Toxisch (vertraagd of chronisch)  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die, indien zij worden ingeademd of ingeslikt of indien zij door de huid dringen, vertraagde of chronische gevolgen kunnen hebben, daaronder begrepen carcinogeniteit.  |
| 9  | H12  | Ecotoxisch  Stoffen of afvalstoffen die, indien zij vrijkomen, onmiddellijke of vertraagde schadelijke gevolgen hebben of kunnen hebben voor het milieu door middel van bioaccumulatie, en/of een toxische uitwerking op biotische systemen.  |
| 9  | H13  | In staat, op enigerlei wijze, na verwijdering een ander materiaal af te geven, bijvoorbeeld percolaat, dat één of meer van de hierboven opgesomde eigenschappen bezit.  |

### *Proeven* 

De mogelijke gevaren die bepaalde soorten afvalstoffen met zich meebrengen zijn nog niet volledig gedocumenteerd; er bestaan geen proeven om deze gevaren kwantitatief te omschrijven. Er is meer onderzoek nodig voor het ontwikkelen van middelen om mogelijke gevaren die deze afvalstoffen met zich meebrengen voor de mens en/of het milieu te karakteriseren. Er zijn gestandaardiseerde proeven ontwikkeld ten aanzien van onvermengde stoffen en materialen. Vele landen hebben nationale proeven ontwikkeld die kunnen worden toegepast op in Bijlage I opgesomde materialen, teneinde vast te stellen of deze materialen één of meer van de in deze Bijlage opgesomde eigenschappen vertonen.
