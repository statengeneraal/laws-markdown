### CHAPTER  I  

####International Application and International Search

### Article  3  

####The International Application

(1).  Applications for the protection of inventions in any of the Contracting States may be filed as international applications under this Treaty.   
(2).  An international application shall contain, as specified in this Treaty and the Regulations, a request, a description, one or more claims.   
(3).  The abstract merely serves the purpose of technical information and cannot be taken into account for any other purpose, particularly not for the purpose of interpreting the scope of the protection sought.   
(4).  The international application shall: 

(i) be in a prescribed language;  

(ii) comply with the prescribed physical requirements;  

(iii) comply with the prescribed requirement of unity of invention;  

(iv) be subject to the payment of the prescribed fees.     

### Article  4  

####The Request

(1).  The request shall contain: 

(i) a petition to the effect that the international application be processed according to this Treaty;  

(ii) the designation of the Contracting State or States in which protection for the invention is desired on the basis of the international application (“designated States”); if for any designated State a regional patent is available and the applicant wishes to obtain a regional patent rather than a national patent, the request shall so indicate; if, under a treaty concerning a regional patent, the applicant cannot limit his application to certain of the States party to that treaty, designation of one of those States and the indication of the wish to obtain the regional patent shall be treated as designation of all the States party to that treaty; if, under the national law of the designated State, the designation of that State has the effect of an application for a regional patent, the designation of the said State shall be treated as an indication of the wish to obtain the regional patent;  

(iii) the name of and other prescribed data concerning the applicant and the agent (if any);  

(iv) the title of the invention;  

(v) the name of and other prescribed data concerning the inventor where the national law of at least one of the designated States requires that these indications be furnished at the time of filing a national application. Otherwise, the said indications may be furnished either in the request or in separate notices addressed to each designated Office whose national law requires the furnishing of the said indications but allows that they be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of a national application.     
(2).  Every designation shall be subject to the payment of the prescribed fee within the prescribed time limit.   
(3).  Unless the applicant asks for any of the other kinds of protection referred to in Article 43, designation shall mean that the desired protection consists of the grant of a patent by or for the designated State. For the purposes of this paragraph, Article 2(ii) shall not apply.   
(4).  Failure to indicate in the request the name and other prescribed data concerning the inventor shall have no consequence in any designated State whose national law requires the furnishing of the said indications but allows that they be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of a national application. Failure to furnish the said indications in a separate notice shall have no consequence in any designated State whose national law does not require the furnishing of the said indications.   

### Article  5  

####The Description

The description shall disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.  

### Article  6  

####The Claims

The claim or claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought. Claims shall be clear and concise. They shall be fully supported by the description.  

### Article  7  

####The Drawings

(1).  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2)(ii), drawings shall be required when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention.   
(2).  Where, without being necessary for the understanding of the invention, the nature of the invention admits of illustration by drawings: 

(i) the applicant may include such drawings in the international application when filed,  

(ii) any designated Office may require that the applicant file such drawings with it within the prescribed time limit.     

### Article  8  

####Claiming Priority

(1).  The international application may contain a declaration, as prescribed in the Regulations, claiming the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in or for any country party to the [Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).   
(2).

(b) The international application for which the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in or for a Contracting State is claimed may contain the designation of that State. Where, in the international application, the priority of one or more national applications filed in or for a designated State is claimed, or where the priority of an international application having designated only one State is claimed, the conditions for, and the effect of, the priority claim in that State shall be governed by the national law of that State.     

### Article  9  

####The Applicant

(1).  Any resident or national of a Contracting State may file an international application.   
(2).  The Assembly may decide to allow the residents and the nationals of any country party to the [Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md) which is not party to this Treaty to file international applications.

(2).  If the international application refers to drawings which, in fact, are not included in that application, the receiving Office shall notify the applicant accordingly and he may furnish them within the prescribed time limit and, if he does, the international filing date shall be the date on which the drawings are received by the receiving Office. Otherwise, any reference to the said drawings shall be considered non-existent.   
(3).  

(a) If the receiving Office finds that, within the prescribed time limits, the fees prescribed under Article 3 (4) (iv) have not been paid, or no fee prescribed under Article 4 (2) has been paid in respect of any of the designated States, the international application shall be considered withdrawn and the receiving Office shall so declare.

### Article  15  

####The International Search

(1).  Each international application shall be the subject of international search.   
(2).  The objective of the international search is to discover relevant prior art.   
(3).  International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and the drawings (if any).   
(4).  The International Searching Authority referred to in Article 16 shall endeavor to discover as much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit, and shall, in any case, consult the documentation specified in the Regulations.   
(5).  

(a) If the national law of the Contracting State so permits, the applicant who files a national application with the national Office of or acting for such State may, subject to the conditions provided for in such law, request that a search similar to an international search (“international-type search”) be carried out on such application.  

(b) If the national law of the Contracting State so permits, the national Office of or acting for such State may subject any-national application filed with it to an international-type search.  

(c) The international-type search shall be carried out by the International Searching Authority referred to in Article 16 which would be competent for an international search if the national application were an international application and were filed with the Office referred to in subparagraphs *(a)* and *(b)*. If the national application is in a language which the International Searching Authority considers it is not equipped to handle, the international-type search shall be carried out on a translation prepared by the applicant in a language prescribed for international applications and which the International Searching Authority has undertaken to accept for international applications. The national application and the translation, when required, shall be presented in the form prescribed for international applications.     

### Article  16  

####The International Searching Authority

(1).  International search shall be carried out by an International Searching Authority, which may be either a national Office or an intergovernmental organization, such as the International Patent Institute, whose tasks include the establishing of documentary search reports on prior art with respect to inventions which are the subject of applications.   
(2).  If, pending the establishment of a single International Searching Authority, there are several International Searching Authorities, each receiving Office shall, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable agreement referred to in paragraph (3) *(b)*, specify the International Searching Authority or Authorities competent for the searching of international applications filed with such Office.   
(3).  

(a) International Searching Authorities shall be appointed by the Assembly. Any national Office and any intergovernmental organization satisfying the requirements referred to in subparagraph *(c)* may be appointed as International Searching Authority.  

(b) Appointment shall be conditional on the consent of the national Office or intergovernmental organization to be appointed and the conclusion of an agreement, subject to approval by the Assembly, between such Office or organization and the International Bureau. The agreement shall specify the rights and obligations of the parties, in particular, the formal undertaking by the said Office or organization to apply and observe all the common rules of international search.  

(c) The Regulations prescribe the minimum requirements, particularly as to manpower and documentation, which any Office or organization must satisfy before it can be appointed and must continue to satisfy while it remains appointed.  

(d) Appointment shall be for a fixed period of time and may be extended for further periods.  

(e) Before the Assembly makes a decision on the appointment of any national Office or intergovernmental organization, or on the extension of its appointment, or before it allows any such appointment to lapse, the Assembly shall hear the interested Office or organization and seek the advice of the Committee for Technical Cooperation referred to in Article 56 once that Committee has been established.     

### Article  17  

####Procedure Before the International Searching Authority

(1).  Procedure before the International Searching Authority shall be governed by the provisions of this Treaty, the Regulations, and the agreement which the International Bureau shall conclude, subject to this Treaty and the Regulations, with the said Authority.   
(2).  

(a) If the International Searching Authority considers 

(i) that the international application relates to a subject matter which the International Searching Authority is not required, under the Regulations, to search, and in the particular case decides not to search, or  

(ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, fail to comply with the prescribed requirements to such an extent that a meaningful search could not be carried out,   the said Authority shall so declare and shall notify the applicant and the International Bureau that no international search report will be established.  

(b) If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph *(a)* is found to exist in connection with certain claims only, the international search report shall so indicate in respect of such claims, whereas, for the other claims, the said report shall be established as provided in Article 18.     
(3).  

(a) If the International Searching Authority considers that the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention as set forth in the Regulations, it shall invite the applicant to pay additional fees. The International Searching Authority shall establish the international search report on those parts of the international application which relate to the invention first mentioned in the claims (“main invention”) and, provided the required additional fees have been paid within the prescribed time limit, on those parts of the international application which relate to inventions in respect of which the said fees were paid.  

(b) The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the national Office of that State finds the invitation, referred to in paragraph *(a)*, of the International Searching Authority justified and where the applicant has not paid all additional fees, those parts of the international application which consequently have not been searched shall, as far as effects in that State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to the national Office of that State.     

### Article  18  

####The International Search Report

(1).  The international search report shall be established within the prescribed time limit and in the prescribed form.

(3).  The international search report or the declaration referred to in Article 17 (2) *(a)* shall be translated as provided in the Regulations. The translations shall be prepared by or under the responsibility of the International Bureau.   

### Article  19  

####Amendment of the Claims Before the International Bureau

(1).  The applicant shall, after having received the international search report, be entitled to one opportunity to amend the claims of the international application by filing amendments with the International Bureau within the prescribed time limit. He may, at the same time, file a brief statement, as provided in the Regulations, explaining the amendments and indicating any impact that such amendments might have on the description and the drawings.   
(2).  The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.   
(3).  If the national law of any designated State permits amendments to go beyond the said disclosure, failure to comply with paragraph (2) shall have no consequence in that State.   

### Article  20  

####Communication to Designated Offices

(1).  

(a) The international application, together with the international search report (including any indication referred to in Article 17 (2) *(b))* or the declaration referred to in Article 17 (2) (a), shall be communicated to each designated Office, as provided in the Regulations, unless the designated Office waives such requirement in its entirety or in part.  

(b) The communication shall include the translation (as prescribed) of the said report or declaration.     
(2).  If the claims have been amended by virtue of Article 19 (1), the communication shall either contain the full text of the claims both as filed and as amended or shall contain the full text of the claims as filed and specify the amendments, and shall include the statement, if any, referred to in Article 19 (1).   
(3).  At the request of the designated Office or the applicant, the International Searching Authority shall send to the said Office or the applicant, respectively, copies of the documents cited in the international search report, as provided in the Regulations.

(6).  If the international application contains expressions or drawings which, in the opinion of the International Bureau, are contrary to morality or public order, or if, in its opinion, the international application contains disparaging statements as defined in the Regulations, it may omit such expressions, drawings, and statements, from its publications, indicating the place and number of words or drawings omitted, and furnishing, upon request, individual copies of the passages omitted.   

### Article  22  

####Copy, Translation, and Fee, to Designated Offices

1.  The applicant shall furnish a copy of the international application (unless the communication provided for in Article 20 has already taken place) and a translation thereof (as prescribed), and pay the national fee (if any), to each designated Office not later than at the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. Where the national law of the designated State requires the indication of the name of and other prescribed data concerning the inventor but allows that these indications be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of a national application, the applicant shall, unless they were contained in the request, furnish the said indications to the national Office of or acting for the State not later than at the expiration of 30 months from the priority date.   
2.  Where the International Searching Authority makes a declaration, under Article 17 (2)(a), that no international search report will be established, the time limit for performing the acts referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article shall be the same as that provided for in paragraph (1).   
3.  Any national law may, for performing the acts referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2), fix time limits which expire later than the time limit provided for in those paragraphs.   

### Article  23  

####Delaying of National Procedure

(1).  No designated Office shall process or examine the international application prior to the expiration of the applicable time limit under Article 22.   
(2).  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), any designated Office may, on the express request of the applicant, process or examine the international application at any time.   

### Article  24  

####Possible Loss of Effect in Designated States

(1).  Subject, in case (ii) below, to the provisions of Article 25, the effect of the international application provided for in Article 11 (3) shall cease in any designated State with the same consequences as the withdrawal of any national application in that State: 

(i) if the applicant withdraws his international application or the disgnation of that State;  

(ii) if the international application is considered withdrawn by virtue of Articles 12(3), 14 (1), *(v)*, 14(3) *(a)*, or 14 (4), or if the designation of that State is considered withdrawn by virtue of Article 14 (3) *(b)*;  

(iii) if the applicant fails to perform the acts referred to in Article 22 within the applicable time limit.     
(2).  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), any designated Office may maintain the effect provided for in Article 11 (3) even where such effect is not required to be maintained by virtue of Article 25 (2).   

### Article  25  

####Review By Designated Offices

(1).  

(a) Where the receiving Office has refused to accord an international filing date or has declared that the international application is considered withdrawn, or where the International Bureau has made a finding under Article 12 (3), the International Bureau shall promptly send, at the request of the applicant, copies of any document in the file to any of the designated Offices named by the applicant.  

(b) Where the receiving Office has declared that the designation of any given State is considered withdrawn, the International Bureau shall promptly send, at the request of the applicant, copies of any document in the file to the national Office of such State.  

(c) The request under subparagraphs *(a)* or *(b)* shall be presented within the prescribed time limit.     
(2).  

(a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph *(b)*, each designated Office shall, provided that the national fee (if any) has been paid and the appropriate translation (as prescribed) has been furnished within the prescribed time limit, decide whether the refusal, declaration, or finding, referred to in paragraph (1) was justified under the provisions of this Treaty and the Regulations, and, if it finds that the refusal or declaration was the result of an error or omission on the part of the receiving Office or that the finding was the result of an error or omission on the part of the International Bureau, it shall, as far as effects in the State of the designated Office are concerned, treat the international application as if such error or omission had not occurred.  

(b) Where the record copy has reached the International Bureau after the expiration of the time limit prescribed under Article 12 (3) on account of any error or omission on the part of the applicant, the provisions of subparagraph *(a)* shall apply only under the circumstances referred to in Article 48 (2).     

### Article  26  

####Opportunity to Correct Before Designated Offices

No designated Office shall reject an international application on the grounds of non-compliance with the requirements of this Treaty and the Regulations without first giving the applicant the opportunity to correct the said application to the extent and according to the procedure provided by the national law for the same or comparable situations in respect of national applications.  

### Article  27  

####National Requirements

(1).  No national law shall require compliance with requirements relating to the form or contents of the international application different from or additional to those which are provided for in this Treaty and the Regulations.   
(2).  The provisions of paragraph (1) neither affect the application of the provisions of Article 7 (2) nor preclude any national law from requiring, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, the furnishing: 

(i) when the applicant is a legal entity, of the name of an officer entitled to represent such legal entity,  

(ii) of documents not part of the international application but which constitute proof of allegations or statements made in that application, including the confirmation of the international application by the signature of the applicant when that application, as filed, was signed by his representative or agent.     
(3).  Where the applicant, for the purposes of any designated State, is not qualified according to the national law of that State to file a national application because he is not the inventor, the international application may be rejected by the designated Office.   
(4).  Where the national law provides, in respect of the form or contents of national applications, for requirements which, from the viewpoint of applicants, are more favorable than the requirements provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations in respect of international applications, the national Office, the courts and any other competent organs of or acting for the designated State may apply the former requirements, instead of the latter requirements, to international applications, except where the applicant insists that the requirements provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations be applied to his international application.   
(5).  Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as prescribing anything that would limit the freedom of each Contracting State to prescribe such substantive conditions of patentability as it desires. In particular, any provision in this Treaty and the Regulations concerning the definition of prior art is exclusively for the purposes of the international procedure and, consequently, any Contracting State is free to apply, when determining the patentability of an invention claimed in an international application, the criteria of its national law in respect of prior art and other conditions of patentability not constituting requirements as to the form and contents of applications.   
(6).  The national law may require that the applicant furnish evidence in respect of any substantive condition of patentability prescribed by such law.   
(7).  Any receiving Office or, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, that Office may apply the national law as far as it relates to any requirement that the applicant be represented by an agent having the right to represent applicants before the said Office and/or that the applicant have an address in the designated State for the purpose of receiving notifications.   
(8).  Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as limiting the freedom of any Contracting State to apply measures deemed necessary for the preservation of its national security or to limit, for the protection of the general economic interests of that State, the right of its own residents or nationals to file international applications.   

### Article  28  

####Amendment of the Claims, the Description, and the Drawings Before Designated Offices

(1).  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to amend the claims, the description, and the drawings, before each designated Office within the prescribed time limit. No designated Office shall grant a patent, or refuse the grant of a patent, before such time limit has expired except with the express consent of the applicant.   
(2).  The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed unless the national law of the designated State permits them to go beyond the said disclosure.   
(3).  The amendments shall be in accordance with the national law of the designated State in all respects not provided for in this Treaty and the Regulations.   
(4).  Where the designated Office requires a translation of the international application, the amendments shall be in the language of the translation.   

### Article  29  

####Effects of the International Publication

(1).  As far as the protection of any rights of the applicant in a designated State is concerned, the effects, in that State, of the international publication of an international application shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) to (4), be the same as those which the national law of the designated State provides for the compulsory national publication of unexamined national applications as such.   
(2).  If the language in which the international publication has been effected is different from the language in which publications under the national law are effected in the designated State, the said national law may provide that the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from such time as: 

(i) a translation into the latter language has been published as provided by the national law, or  

(ii) a translation into the latter language has been made available to the public, by laying open for public inspection as provided by the national law, or  

(iii) a translation into the latter language has been transmitted by the applicant to the actual or prospective unauthorized user of the invention claimed in the international application, or  

(iv) both the acts described in (i) and (iii), or both the acts described in (ii) and (iii), have taken place.     
(3).  The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the international publication has been effected, on the request of the applicant, before the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the expiration of 18 months from the priority date.   
(4).  The national law of any designated State may provide that the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the date on which a copy of the international application as published under Article 21 has been received in the national Office of or acting for such State. The said Office shall publish the date of receipt in its gazette as soon as possible.   

### Article  30  

####Confidential Nature of the International Application

(1).  

(a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph *(b)*, the International Bureau and the International Searching Authorities shall not allow access by any person or authority to the international application before the international publication of that application, unless requested or authorized by the applicant.  

(b) The provisions of subparagraph *(a)* shall not apply to any transmittal to the competent International Searching Authority, to transmittals provided for under Article 13, and to communications provided for under Article 20.     
(2).  

(a) No national Office shall allow access to the international application by third parties, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, before the earliest of the following dates: 

(i) date of the international publication of the international application,  

(ii) date of the receipt of the communication of the international application under Article 20,  

(iii) date of the receipt of a copy of the international application under Article 22.    

(b) The provisions of subparagraph *(a)* shall not prevent any national Office from informing third parties that it has been designated, or from publishing that fact. Such information or publication may, however, contain only the following data: identification of the receiving Office, name of the applicant, international filing date, international application number, and title of the invention.  

(c) The provisions of subparagraph *(a)* shall not prevent any designated Office from allowing access to the international application for the purposes of the judicial authorities.     
(3).  The provisions of paragraph (2) *(a)* shall apply to any receiving Office except as far as transmittals provided for under Article 12 (1) are concerned.   
(4).  For the purposes of this Article, the term “access” covers any means by which third parties may acquire cognizance, including individual communication and general publication, provided, however, that no national Office shall generally publish an international application or its translation before the international publication or, if international publication has not taken place by the expiration of 20 months from the priority date, before the expiration of 20 months from the said priority date.   

### CHAPTER  II  

####International Preliminary Examination

### Article  31

(2).  In the case of demands referred to in Article 31 (2) *(a)*, the receiving Office, and, in the case of demands referred to in Article 31 (2) *(b)*, the Assembly, shall, in accordance with the applicable agreement between the interested International Preliminary Examining Authority or Authorities and the International Bureau, specify the International Preliminary Examining Authority or Authorities competent for the preliminary examination.   
(3).  The provisions of Article 16(3) shall apply, *mutatis mutandis*, in respect of International Preliminary Examining Authorities.   

### Article  33  

####The International Preliminary Examination

(1).  The objective of the international preliminary examination is to formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable.   
(2).  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered novel if it is not anticipated by the prior art as defined in the Regulations.   
(3).  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered to involve an inventive step if, having regard to the prior art as defined in the Regulations, it is not, at the prescribed relevant date, obvious to a person skilled in the art.   
(4).  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed invention shall be considered industrially applicable if, according to its nature, it can be made or used (in the technological sense) in any kind of industry. “Industry” shall be understood in its broadest sense, as in the [Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).   
(5).  The criteria described above merely serve the purposes of international preliminary examination. Any Contracting State may apply additional or different criteria for the purposes of deciding whether, in that State, the claimed invention is patentable or not.   
(6).  The international preliminary examination shall take into consideration all the documents cited in the international search report. It may take into consideration any additional documents considered to be relevant in the particular case.   

### Article  34  

####Procedure Before the International Preliminary Examining Authority

(1).  Procedure before the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall be governed by the provisions of this Treaty, the Regulations, and the agreement which the International Bureau shall conclude, subject to this Treaty and the Regulations, with the said Authority.   
(2).  

(a) The applicant shall have a right to communicate orally and in writing with the International Preliminary Examining Authority.  

(b) The applicant shall have a right to amend the claims, the description, and the drawings, in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time limit, before the international preliminary examination report is established. The amendment shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.  

(c) The applicant shall receive at least one written opinion from the International Preliminary Examining Authority unless such Authority considers that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: 

(i) the invention satisfies the criteria set forth in Article 33(1),  

(ii) the international application complies with the requirements of this Treaty and the Regulations in so far as checked by that Authority,  

(iii) no observations are intended to be made under Article 34(2), last sentence.    

(d) The applicant may respond to the written opinion.     
(3).  

(a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention as set forth in the Regulations, it may invite the applicant, at his option, to restrict the claims so as to comply with the requirement or to pay additional fees.  

(b) The national law of any elected State may provide that, where the applicant chooses to restrict the claims under subparagraph *(a)*, those parts of the international application which, as a consequence of the restriction, are not to be the subject of international preliminary examination shall, as far as effects in that State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to the national Office of that State.  

(c) If the applicant does not comply with the invitation referred to in subparagraph *(a)* within the prescribed time limit, the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall establish an international preliminary examination report on those parts of the international application which relate to what appears to be the main invention and shall indicate the relevant facts in the said report. The national law of any elected State may provide that, where its national Office finds the invitation of the International Preliminary Examining Authority justified, those parts of the international application which do not relate to the main invention shall, as far as effects in that State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to that Office.     
(4).  

(a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers 

(i) that the international application relates to a subject matter on which the International Preliminary Examining Authority is not required, under the Regulations, to carry out an international preliminary examination, and in the particular case decides not to carry out such examination, or  

(ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), or industrial applicability, of the claimed invention,   the said Authority shall not go into the questions referred to in Article 33(1) and shall inform the applicant of this opinion and the reasons therefor.  

(b) If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph *(a)* is found to exist in, or in connection with, certain claims only, the provisions of that subparagraph shall apply only to the said claims.     

### Article  35  

####The International Preliminary Examination Report

(1).  The international preliminary examination report shall be established within the prescribed time limit and in the prescribed form.   
(2).  The international preliminary examination report shall not contain any statement on the question whether the claimed invention is or seems to be patentable or unpatentable according to any national law. It shall state, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), in relation to each claim, whether the claim appears to satisfy the criteria of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), and industrial applicability, as defined for the purposes of the international preliminary examination in Article 33(1) to (4). The statement shall be accompanied by the citation of the documents believed to support the stated conclusion with such explanations as the circumstances of the case may require. The statement shall also be accompanied by such other observations as the Regulations provide for.   
(3).  

(a) If, at the time of establishing the international preliminary examination report, the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(4) *(a)* exists, that report shall state this opinion and the reasons therefor. It shall not contain any statement as provided in paragraph (2).  

(b) If a situation under Article 34(4) is found to exist, the international preliminary examination report shall, in relation to the claims in question, contain the statement as provided in subparagraph *(a)*, whereas, in relation to the other claims, it shall contain the statement as provided in paragraph (2).     

### Article  36

(b) The elected Offices concerned and the International Preliminary Examining Authority concerned shall be notified accordingly by the International Bureau.     
(4).  

(a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (6), withdrawal of the demand or of the election of a Contracting State shall, unless the national law of that State provides otherwise, be considered to be withdrawal of the international application as far as that State is concerned.  

(b) Withdrawal of the demand or of the election shall not be considered to be withdrawal of the international application if such withdrawal is effected prior to the expiration of the applicable time limit under Article 22; however, any Contracting State may provide in its national law that the aforesaid shall apply only if its national Office has received, within the said time limit, a copy of the international application together with a translation (as prescribed), and the national fee.     

### Article  38  

####Confidential Nature of the International Preliminary Examination

(1).  Neither the International Bureau nor the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, allow access within the meaning, and with the proviso, of Article 30(4) to the file of the international preliminary examination by any person or authority at any time, except by the elected Offices once the international preliminary examination report has been established.   
(2).  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) and Articles 36(1) and (3) and 37(3) *(c)*, neither the International Bureau nor the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, give information on the issuance or non-issuance of an international preliminary examination report and on the withdrawal or non-withdrawal of the demand or of any election.   

### Article  39  

####Copy, Translation, and Fee, to Elected Offices

(1).  

(a) If the election of any Contracting State has been effected prior to the expiration of the 19th month from the priority date, the provisions of Article 22 shall not apply to such State and the applicant shall furnish a copy of the international application (unless the communication under Article 20 has already taken place) and a translation thereof (as prescribed), and pay the national fee (if any), to each elected Office not later than at the expiration of 30 months from the priority date.  

(b) Any national law may, for performing the acts referred to in paragraph *(a),* fix time limits which expire later than the time limit provided for in that subparagraph.     
(2).  The effect provided for in Article 11(3) shall cease in the elected State with the same consequences as the withdrawal of any national application in that State if the applicant fails to perform the acts referred to in paragraph (1) *(a)* within the time limit applicable under paragraph (1) *(a)* or *(b)*.   
(3).  Any elected Office may maintain the effect provided for in Article even where the applicant does not comply with the requirements provided for in paragraph (1) *(a)* or *(b)*.

(ii) indicate the background art which, as far as known to the applicant, can be regarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the invention, and, preferably, cite the documents reflecting such art;  

(iii) disclose the invention, as claimed, in such terms that the technical problem (even if not expressly stated as such) and its solution can be understood, and state the advantageous effects, if any, of the invention with reference to the background art;  

(iv) briefly describe the figures in the drawings, if any;  

(v) set forth at least the best mode contemplated by the applicant for carrying out the invention claimed; this shall be done in terms of examples, where appropriate, and with reference to the drawings, if any; where the national law of the designated State does not require the description of the best mode but is satisfied with the description of any mode (whether it is the best contemplated or not), failure to describe the best mode contemplated shall have no effect in that State;  

(vi) indicate explicitly, when it is not obvious from the description or nature of the invention, the way in which the invention is capable of exploitation in industry and the way in which it can be made and used, or, if it can only be used, the way in which it can be used; the term “industry” is to be understood in its broadest sense as in the [Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).    

(b) The manner and order specified in paragraph *(a)* shall be followed except when, beause of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a different order would result in a better understanding and a more economic presentation.  

(c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph *(b)*, each of the parts referred to in paragraph *(a)* shall preferably be preceded by an appropriate heading as suggested in the Administrative Instructions.     
5.2.   *Nucleotide and/or Amino Acid Sequence Disclosure*

(c) The method of numbering in the case of the amendment of claims shall be governed by the Administrative Instructions.     
6.2.   *References to Other Parts of the International Application*  

(a) Claims shall not, except where absolutely necessary, rely, in respect of the technical features of the invention, on references to the description or drawings. In particular, they shall not rely on such references as: “as described in part.. . of the description,” or “as illustrated in figure... of the drawings.”  

(b) Where the international application contains drawings, the technical features mentioned in the claims shall preferably be followed by the reference signs relating to such features. When used, the reference signs shall preferably be placed between parentheses, if inclusion of reference signs does not particularly facilitate quicker understanding of a claim, it should not be made. Reference signs may be removed by a designated Office for the purposes of publication by such Office.     
6.3.   *Manner of Claiming*  

(a) The definition of the matter for which protection is sought shall be in terms of the technical features of the invention.

(c) Where the national law of the designated State does not require the manner of claiming provided for in paragraph *(b)*, failure to use that manner of claiming shall have no effect in that State provided the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.     
6.4.   *Dependent Claims*  

(a) Any claim which includes all the features of one or more other claims (claim in dependent form, hereinafter referred to as “dependent claim”) shall do so by a reference, if possible at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and shall then state the additional features claimed. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other claim (“multiple dependent claim”) shall refer to such claims in the alternative only. Multiple dependent claims shall not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Searching Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the preceding two sentences, failure to use that manner of claiming may result in an indication under Article 17(2)(b) in the international search report. Failure to use the said manner of claiming shall have no effect in a designated State if the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.  

(b) Any dependent claim shall be construed as including all the limitations contained in the claim to which it refers or, if the dependent claim is a multiple dependent claim, all the limitations contained in the particular claim in relation to which it is considered.  

(c) All dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim, and all dependent claims referring back to several previous claims, shall be grouped together to the extent and in the most practical way possible.     
6.5.   *Utility Models*  Any designated State in which the grant of a utility model is sought on the basis of an international application may, instead of Rules 6.1 to 6.4, apply in respect of the matters regulated in those Rules the provisions of its national law concerning utility models once the processing of the international application has started in that State, provided that the applicant shall be allowed at least 2 months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under Article 22 to adapt his application to the requirements of the said provisions of the national law.

### Rule  26bis  

####Correction or Addition of Priority Claim

26bis.1.   *Correction or Addition of Priority Claim*  

a) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. The correction of a priority claim may include the addition of any indication referred to in Rule 4.10.  

b) Any notice referred to in paragraph a) received by the receiving Office or the International Bureau after the applicant has made a request for early publication under Article 21(2)b) shall be considered not to have been submitted, unless that request is withdrawn before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed.  

c) Where the correction or addition of a priority claim causes a change in the priority date, any time limit which is computed from the previously applicable priority date and which has not already expired shall be computed from the priority date as so changed.     
26bis.2.   *Defects in Priority Claims*  

a) Where the receiving Office or, if the receiving Office fails to do so, the International Bureau, finds in relation to a priority claim: 

(i) that the international application has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired and that a request for restoration of the right of priority under Rule 26 *bis*.3 has not been submitted;  

(ii) that the priority claim does not comply with the requirements of Rule 4.10; or  

(iii) that any indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the corresponding indication appearing in the priority document;   the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall invite the applicant to correct the priority claim. In the case referred to in item (i), where the international filing date is within two months from the date on which the priority period expired, the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall also notify the applicant of the possibility of submitting a request for the restoration of the right of priority in accordance with Rule 26 *bis*.3, unless the receiving Office has notified the International Bureau under Rule 26 *bis*.3j) of the incompatibility of Rule 26 *bis*.3a) to (i) with the national law applied by that Office.  

b) If the applicant does not, before the expiration of the time limit under Rule 26 *bis*.1a), submit a notice correcting the priority claim, that priority claim shall, subject to paragraph c), for the purposes of the procedure under the Treaty, be considered not to have been made (“considered void”) and the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall so declare and shall inform the applicant accordingly. Any notice correcting the priority claim which is received before the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, so declares and not later than one month after the expiration of that time limit shall be considered to have been received before the expiration of that time limit.  

c) A priority claim shall not be considered void only because: 

(i) the indication of the number of the earlier application referred to in Rule 4.10a)(ii) is missing;  

(ii) an indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the corresponding indication appearing in the priority document; or  

(iii) the international application has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the international filing date is within the period of two months from that date.    

d) Where the receiving Office or the International Bureau has made a declaration under paragraph b) or where the priority claim has not been considered void only because paragraph c) applies, the International Bureau shall publish, together with the international application, information concerning the priority claim as prescribed by the Administrative Instructions, as well as any information submitted by the applicant concerning such priority claim which is received by the International Bureau prior to the completion of the technical preparations for international publication. Such information shall be included in the communication under Article 20 where the international application is not published by virtue of Article 64(3).  

e) Where the applicant wishes to correct or add a priority claim but the time limit under Rule 26 *bis*.1 has expired, the applicant may, prior to the expiration of 30 months from the priority date and subject to the payment of a special fee whose amount shall be fixed in the Administrative Instructions, request the International Bureau to publish information concerning the matter, and the International Bureau shall promptly publish such information.     
26bis.3.   *Restoration of Right of Priority by Receiving Office*  

a) Where the international application has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired but within the period of two months from that date, the receiving Office shall, on the request of the applicant, and subject to paragraphs b) to g) of this Rule, restore the right of priority if the Office finds that a criterion applied by it (“criterion for restoration”) is satisfied, namely, that the failure to file the international application within the priority period: 

(i) occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken; or  

(ii) was unintentional.   Each receiving Office shall apply at least one of those criteria and may apply both of them.  

b) A request under paragraph a) shall: 

(i) be filed with the receiving Office within the time limit applicable under paragraph e);  

(ii) state the reasons for the failure to file the international application within the priority period; and  

(iii) preferably be accompanied by any declaration or other evidence required under paragraph f).    

c) Where a priority claim in respect of the earlier application is not contained in the international application, the applicant shall submit, within the time limit applicable under paragraph e), a notice under Rule 26 *bis*.1a) adding the priority claim.  

d) The submission of a request under paragraph (a) may be subjected by the receiving Office to the payment to it, for its own benefit, of a fee for requesting restoration, payable within the time limit applicable under paragraph (e). The amount of that fee, if any, shall be fixed by the receiving Office. The time limit for payment of the fee may be extended, at the option of the receiving Office, for a period of up to two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under paragraph (e).  

e) The time limit referred to in paragraphs b)(i), c) and d) shall be two months from the date on which the priority period expired, provided that, where the applicant makes a request for early publication under Article 21(2)b), any request under paragraph a) or any notice referred to in paragraph c) submitted, or any fee referred to in paragraph d) paid, after the technical preparations for international publication have been completed shall be considered as not having been submitted or paid in time.   

f) The receiving Office may require that a declaration or other evidence in support of the statement of reasons referred to in paragraph b)(iii) be filed with it within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. The applicant may furnish to the International Bureau a copy of any such declaration or other evidence filed with the receiving Office, in which case the International Bureau shall include such copy in its files.  

g) The receiving Office shall not refuse, totally or in part, a request under paragraph a) without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations on the intended refusal within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. Such notice of intended refusal by the receiving Office may be sent to the applicant together with any invitation to file a declaration or other evidence under paragraph f).  

h) The receiving Office shall promptly: 

(i) notify the International Bureau of the receipt of a request under paragraph a);  

(ii) make a decision upon the request;  

(iii) notify the applicant and the International Bureau of its decision and the criterion for restoration upon which the decision was based.    

i) Each receiving Office shall inform the International Bureau of which of the criteria for restoration it applies and of any subsequent changes in that respect. The International Bureau shall promptly publish such information in the Gazette.  

j) If, on October 5, 2005, paragraphs a) to (i) are not compatible with the national law applied by the receiving Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in respect of that Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible with that law, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau accordingly by April 5, 2006. The information received shall be promptly published by the International Bureau in the Gazette.

(b) When any written disclosure refers to an oral disclosure, use, exhibition, or other means whereby the contents of the written disclosure were made available to the public, and such making available to the public occurred on a date prior to the international filing date, the international search report shall separately mention that fact and the date on which it occurred if the making available to the public of the written disclosure occurred on a date which is the same as, of later than, the international filing date.  

(c) Any published application or any patent whose publication date is the same as, or later than, but whose filing date, or, where applicable, claimed priority date, is earlier than the international filing date of the international application searched, and which would constitute relevant prior art for the purposes of Article 15(2) had it been published prior to the international filing date, shall be specially mentioned in the international search report.     
33.2.   *Fields to be Covered by the International Search*  

(a) The international search shall cover all those technical fields, and shall be carried out on the basis of all those search files, which may contain material pertinent to the invention.  

(b) Consequently, not only shall the art in which the invention is classifiable be searched but also analogous arts regardless of where classified.  

(c) The question what arts are, in any given case, to be regarded as analogous shall be considered in the light of what appears to be the necessary essential function or use of the invention and not only the specific functions expressly indicated in the international application.  

(d) The international search shall embrace all subject matter that is generally recognized as equivalent to the subject matter of the claimed invention for all or certain of its features, even though, in its specifics, the invention as described in the international application is different.     
33.3.   *Orientation of the International Search*  

(a) International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and the drawings (if any) and with particular emphasis on the inventive concept towards which the claims are directed.  

(b) In so far as possible and reasonable, the international search shall cover the entire subject matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be expected to be directed after they have been amended.

(a-bis) Any Contracting State not requiring the furnishing, under Article 22, by the applicant of a copy of the international application (even though the communication of the copy of the international application by the International Bureau under Rule 47 has not taken place by the expiration of the time limit applicable under Article 22) shall notify the International Bureau accordingly.  

(a-ter) Any Contracting State which, pursuant to Article 24(2), maintains, if it is a designated State, the effect provided for in Article 11(3) even though a copy of the international application is not furnished by the applicant by the expiration of the time limit applicable under Article 22 shall notify the International Bureau accordingly.

Otherwise, the effective date of any change shall be determined by the Contracting State.     
49.2.   *Languages*  The language into which translation may be required must be an official language of the designated Office. If there are several of such languages, no translation may be required if the international application is in one of them.

(iii) be accompanied by a copy of the drawings.    

(a-bis) No designated Office shall require the applicant to furnish to it a translation of any text matter contained in the sequence listing part of the description if such sequence listing part complies with Rule 12.1d) and if the description complies with Rule 5.2b).

(f) The expression “Fig.” does not require translation into any language.  

(g) Where any copy of the drawings or any drawing executed anew which has been furnished under paragraph (d) or (e) does not comply with the physical requirements referred to in Rule 11, the designated Office may invite the applicant to correct the defect within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances and shall be fixed in the invitation.

b) The request under paragraph a) shall be submitted to the designated Office, and the acts referred to in Article 22 shall be performed, within whichever of the following periods expires first:

b) If the applicant wishes the international application to be treated, in a designated State in respect of which Article 44 applies, as an application for the grant of more than one kind of protection referred to in Article 43, the applicant, when performing the acts referred to in Article 22, shall so indicate to the designated Office and shall indicate, if applicable, which kind of protection is sought primarily and which kind is sought subsidiarily.

(i) occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken; or  

(ii) was unintentional.   Each designated Office shall apply at least one of those criteria and may apply both of them.

f) Where the national law applicable by the designated Office provides, in respect of the restoration of the right of priority, for requirements which, from the viewpoint of applicants, are more favorable than the requirements provided for under paragraphs a) and b), the designated Office may, when determining the right of priority, apply the requirements under the applicable national law instead of the requirements under those paragraphs.  

g) Each designated Office shall inform the International Bureau of which of the criteria for restoration it applies, of the requirements, where applicable, of the national law applicable in accordance with paragraph f), and of any subsequent changes in that respect. The International Bureau shall promptly publish such information in the Gazette.

### Rule  64  

####Prior Art for International Preliminary Examination

64.1.   *Prior Art*  

(a) For the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3), everything made available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations) shall be considered prior art provided that such making available occurred prior to the relevant date.  

(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a), the relevant date shall be: 

(i) subject to items (ii) and (iii), the international filing date of the international application under international preliminary examination;  

(ii) where the international application under international preliminary examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international filing date which is within the priority period, the filing date of such earlier application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the priority claim is not valid;  

(iii) where the international application under international preliminary examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired but within the period of two months from that date, the filing date of such earlier application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the priority claim is not valid for reasons other than the fact that the international application has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired.       
64.2.   *Non-Written Disclosures*  In cases where the making available to the public occurred by means of an oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other non-written means (“non-written disclosure”) before the relevant date as defined in Rule 64.1 (b) and the date of such non-written disclosure is indicated in a written disclosure which has been made available to the public on a date which is the same as, or later than, the relevant date, the non-written disclosure shall not be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3). Nevertheless, the international preliminary examination report shall call attention to such non-written disclosure in the manner provided for in Rule 70.9.   
64.3.   *Certain Published Documents*  In cases where any application or any patent which would constitute prior art for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3) had it been published prior to the relevant date referred to in Rule 64.1 was published on a date which is the same as, or later than, the relevant date but was filed earlier than the relevant date or claimed the priority of an earlier application which had been filed prior to the relevant date, such published application or patent shall not be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3). Nevertheless, the international preliminary examination report shall call attention to such application or patent in the manner provided for in Rule 70.10.   

### Rule  65  

####Inventive Step or Non-Obviousness

65.1.  For the purposes of Article 33(3), the international preliminary examination shall take into consideration the relation of any particular claim to the prior art as a whole. It shall take into consideration the claim's relation not only to individual documents or parts thereof taken separately but also its relation to combinations of such documents or parts of documents, where such combinations are obvious to a person skilled in the art.   
65.2.   *Relevant Date*  For the purposes of Article 33(3), the relevant date for the consideration of inventive step (non-obviousness) is the date prescribed in Rule 64.1.   

### Rule  66  

####Procedure before the International Preliminary Examining Authority

66.1.   *Basis of the International Preliminary Examination*  

a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (d), the international preliminary examination shall be based on the international application as filed.  

b) The applicant may submit amendments under Article 34 at the time of filing the demand or, subject to Rule 66.4 *bis*, until the international preliminary examination report is established.  

c) Any amendments under Article 19 made before the demand was filed shall be taken into account for the purposes of the international preliminary examination unless superseded, or considered as reversed, by an amendment under Article 34.  

d) Any amendments under Article 19 made after the demand was filed and any amendments under Article 34 submitted to the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall, subject to Rule 66.4 *bis*, be taken into account for the purposes of the international preliminary examination.  

d-bis) A rectification of an obvious mistake that is authorized under Rule 91.1 shall, subject to Rule 66.4 *bis*, be taken into account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of the international preliminary examination.  

e) Claims relating to inventions in respect of which no international search report has been established need not be the subject of international preliminary examination.     
66.1bis.   *Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority*  

a) Subject to paragraph b), the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority under Rule 43 *bis*.1 shall be considered to be a written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of Rule 66.2a).  

b) An International Preliminary Examining Authority may notify the International Bureau that paragraph a) shall not apply to the procedure before it in respect of written opinions established under Rule 43 *bis*.1 by the International Searching Authority or Authorities specified in the notification, provided that such a notification shall not apply to cases where the national Office or intergovernmental organization that acted as International Searching Authority is also acting as International Preliminary Examining Authority. The International Bureau shall promptly publish any such notification in the Gazette.  

c) Where the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority under Rule 43 *bis*.1 is not, by virtue of a notification under paragraph b), considered to be a written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of Rule 66.2a), the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing.  

d) A written opinion established by the International Searching Authority under Rule 43 *bis*.1 which is not, by virtue of a notification under paragraph b), considered to be a written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of Rule 66.2a) shall nevertheless be taken into account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority in proceeding under Rule 66.2a).     
66.2.   *Written Opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority*  

(a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority 

(i) considers that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(4) exists,  

(ii) considers that the international preliminary examination report should be negative in respect of any of the claims because the invention claimed therein does not appear to be novel, does not appear to involve an inventive step (does not appear to be non-obvious), or does not appear to be industrially applicable,  

(iii) notices that there is some defect in the form or contents of the international application under the Treaty or these Regulations.  

(iv) considers that any amendment goes beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed,  

(v) wishes to accompany the international preliminary examination report by observations on the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or the question whether the claims are fully supported by the description,  

(vi) considers that a claim relates to an invention in respect of which no international search report has been established and has decided not to carry out the international preliminary examination in respect of that claim, or  

(vii) considers that a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is not available to it in such a form that a meaningful international preliminary examination can be carried out,   the said Authority shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Preliminary Examining Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the second and third sentences of Rule 6.4(a), the International Preliminary Examining Authority may, in case of failure to use that manner of claiming, apply Article 34(4)(b). In such case, it shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing.  

(b) The notification shall fully state the reasons for the opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority.  

(c) The notification shall invite the applicant to submit a written reply together, where appropriate, with amendment.  

(d) The notification shall fix a time limit for the reply. The time limit shall be reasonable under the circumstances. It shall normally be two months after the date of notification. In no case shall it be shorter than one month after the said date. It shall be at least two months after the said date where the international search report is transmitted at the same time as the notification. It shall, subject to paragraph e), not be more than three months after the said date.  

e) The time limit for replying to the notification may be extended if the applicant so requests before its expiration.     
66.3.   *Formal Response to the International Preliminary Examining Authority*  

(a) The applicant may respond to the invitation referred to in Rule 66.2(c) of the International Preliminary Examining Authority by making amendments or - if he disagrees with the opinion of that Authority - by submitting arguments, as the case may be, or do both.  

(b) Any response shall be submitted directly to the International Preliminary Examining Authority.     
66.4.   *Additional Opportunity for Submitting Amendments or Arguments*  

(a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority wishes to issue one or more additional written opinions, it may do so, and Rules 66.2 and 66.3 shall apply.  

(b) On the request of the applicant, the International Preliminary Examining Authority may give him one or more additional opportunities to submit amendments or arguments.     
66.4bis.   *Consideration of Amendments, Arguments and Rectifications of Obvious Mistakes*  Amendments, arguments and rectifications of obvious mistakes need not be taken into account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of a written opinion or the international preliminary examination report if they are received by, authorized by or notified to that Authority, as applicable, after it has begun to draw up that opinion or report.   
66.5.   *Amendment*  Any change, other than the rectification of an obvious mistake, in the claims, the description, or the drawings, including cancellation of claims, omission of passages in the description, or omission of certain drawings, shall be considered an amendment.   
66.6.   *Informal Communications with the Applicant*  The International Preliminary Examining Authority may, at any time, communicate informally, over the telephone, in writing, or through personal interviews, with the applicant. The said Authority shall, at its discretion, decide whether it wishes to grant more than one personal interview if so requested by the applicant, or whether it wishes to reply to any informal written communication from the applicant.   
66.7.   *Copy and Translation of Earlier Application Whose Priority is Claimed*  

(a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority needs a copy of the earlier application whose priority is claimed in the international application, the International Bureau shall, on request, promptly furnish such copy. If that copy is not furnished to the International Preliminary Examining Authority because the applicant failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 17.1, and if that earlier application was not filed with that Authority in its capacity as a national Office or the priority document is not available to that Authority from a digital library in accordance with the Administrative Instructions, the international preliminary examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed.  

(b) If the application whose priority is claimed in the international application is in a language other than the language or one of the languages of the International Preliminary Examining Authority, that Authority may, where the validity of the priority claim is relevant for the formulation of the opinion referred to in Article 33(1), invite the applicant to furnish a translation in the said language or one of the said languages within two months from the date of the invitation. If the translation is not furnished within that time limit, the international preliminary examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed.     
66.8.   *Form of Amendments*  

a) Subject to paragraph (b), when amending the description or the drawings, the applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet for every sheet of the international application which, on account of an amendment, differs from the sheet previously filed. The replacement sheet or sheets shall be accompanied by a letter which shall draw attention to the differences between the replaced sheets and the replacement sheets, shall indicate the basis for the amendment in the application as filed and shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment.  

b) Where the amendment consists in the deletion of passages or in minor alterations or additions, the replacement sheet referred to in paragraph a) may be a copy of the relevant sheet of the international application containing the alterations or additions, provided that the clarity and direct reproducibility of that sheet are not adversely affected. To the extent that any amendment results in the cancellation of an entire sheet, that amendment shall be communicated in a letter which shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment.  

c) When amending the claims, Rule 46.5 shall apply *mutatis mutandis*. The set of claims submitted under Rule 46.5 as applicable by virtue of this paragraph shall replace all the claims originally filed or previously amended under Articles 19 or 34, as the case may be.     

### Rule  67  

####Subject Matter under Article 34(4) (a) (i)

67.1.   *Definition*  No International Preliminary Examining Authority shall be required to carry out an international preliminary examination on an international application if, and to the extent to which, its subject matter is any of the following:

### Rule  68  

####Lack of Unity of Invention (International Preliminary Examination)

68.1.   *No Invitation to Restrict or Pay*  Where the International Preliminary Examining Authority finds that the requirement of unity of invention is not complied with and chooses not to invite the applicant to restrict the claims or to pay additional fees, it shall proceed with the international preliminary examination, subject to Article 34(4)(b) and Rule 66.1(e), in respect of the entire international application, but shall indicate, in any written opinion and in the international preliminary examination report, that it considers that the requirement of unity of invention is not fulfilled and it shall specify the reasons therefor.   
68.2.   *Invitation to Restrict or Pay*  Where the International Preliminary Examining Authority finds that the requirement of unity of invention is not complied with and chooses to invite the applicant, at his option, to restrict the claims or to pay additional fees, the invitation shall: 

(i) specify at least one possibility of restriction which, in the opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority, would be in compliance with the applicable requirement;  

(ii) specify the reasons for which the International application is not considered as complying with the requirement of unity of invention;  

(iii) invite the applicant to comply with the invitation within one month from the date of the invitation;  

(iv) indicate the amount of the required additional fees to be paid in case the applicant so chooses; and  

(v) invite the applicant to pay, where applicable, the protest fee referred to in Rule 68.3(e) within one month from the date of the invitation, and indicate the amount to be paid.     
68.3.   *Additional Fees*  

a) The amount of the additional fees due for International preliminary examination under Article 34(3)(a) shall be determined by the competent International Preliminary Examining Authority.  

b) The additional fees due for International preliminary examination under Article 34(3)(a) shall be payable direct to the International Preliminary Examining Authority.  

c) Any applicant may pay the additional fees under protest, that is, accompanied by a reasoned statement to the effect that the International application complies with the requirement of unity of invention or that the amount of the required additional fees is excessive. Such protest shall be examined by a review body constituted in the framework of the International Preliminary Examining Authority which, to the extent that it finds the protest justified, shall order the total or partial reimbursement to the applicant of the additional fees. On the request of the applicant, the text of both the protest and the decision thereon shall be notified to the elected Offices as an annex to the International preliminary examination report.  

d) The membership of the review body referred to in paragraph (c) may include, but shall not be limited to, the person who made the decision which is the subject of the protest.  

e) The examination of a protest referred to in paragraph (c) may be subjected by the International Preliminary Examining Authority to the payment to it, for its own benefit, of a protest fee. Where the applicant has not, within the time limit under Rule 68.2(v), paid any required protest fee, the protest shall be considered not to have been made and the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall so declare. The protest fee shall be refunded to the applicant where the review body referred to in paragraph (c) finds that the protest was entirely justified.     
68.4.   *Procedure in the Case of Insufficient Restriction of the Claims*  If the applicant restricts the claims but not sufficiently to comply with the requirement of unity of invention, the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall proceed as provided in Article 34(3) *(c)*.   
68.5.   *Main Invention*  In case of doubt which invention is the main invention for the purposes of Article 34(3) *(c)*, the invention first mentioned in the claims shall be considered the main invention.

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Internationale aanvrage en internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek

### Artikel  3  

####De internationale aanvrage

(1).  Aanvragen voor de bescherming van uitvindingen in de Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen worden ingediend als internationale aanvragen ingevolge dit Verdrag.   
(2).  Een internationale aanvrage dient, zoals aangegeven in dit Verdrag en het Reglement, een verzoekschrift, een beschrijving, één of meer conclusies, één of meer tekeningen (indien nodig) en een uittreksel te bevatten.   
(3).  Het uittreksel is alleen bedoeld als technische informatie en kan niet in aanmerking komen voor enig ander doel, in het bijzonder niet voor de uitlegging van de omvang van de gevraagde bescherming.   
(4).  De internationale aanvrage dient: 

(i) gesteld te zijn in een voorgeschreven taal;  

(ii) te voldoen aan de vormvoorschriften;  

(iii) te voldoen aan het voorgeschreven vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding;  

(iv) onderworpen te zijn aan de betaling van de voorgeschreven taksen.     

### Artikel  4  

####Het verzoekschrift

(1).  Het verzoekschrift bevat: 

(i) een verzoek dat de internationale aanvrage overeenkomstig dit Verdrag wordt behandeld;  

(ii) de aanwijzing van de Verdragsluitende Staat of Staten waarin bescherming voor de uitvinding wordt verlangd op de grondslag van de internationale aanvrage („aangewezen Staten”); indien voor een aangewezen Staat een regionaal octrooi kan worden verkregen en de aanvrager liever een regionaal octrooi dan een nationaal octrooi wenst te verkrijgen, dient zulks in het verzoekschrift te worden vermeld; indien, ingevolge een verdrag betreffende een regionaal octrooi, de aanvrager zijn aanvrage niet kan beperken tot bepaalde Staten die partij zijn bij dat verdrag, worden de aanwijzing van één van deze Staten en de vermelding van de wens ter verkrijging van het regionale octrooi behandeld als een aanwijzing van alle Staten die partij zijn bij dat verdrag; indien, ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat, de aanwijzing van die Staat als een aanvrage om een regionaal octrooi geldt, wordt de aanwijzing van genoemde Staat behandeld als een vermelding van de wens ter verkrijging van het regionale octrooi;  

(iii) de naam van en andere voorgeschreven gegevens betreffende de aanvrager en de mogelijke gemachtigde;  

(iv) de titel van de uitvinding;  

(v) de naam van en andere voorgeschreven gegevens betreffende de uitvinder, indien de nationale wetgeving van ten minste één van de aangewezen Staten vereist dat deze gegevens worden verstrekt op het tijdstip van indiening van een nationale aanvrage. In andere gevallen kunnen de genoemde gegevens worden verstrekt hetzij in het verzoekschrift, hetzij in afzonderlijke kennisgevingen gericht tot elk aangewezen bureau welks nationale wetgeving het verstrekken van de genoemde gegevens vereist, doch toestaat dat zij worden verstrekt op een later tijdstip dan dat van de indiening van een nationale aanvrage.     
(2).  Iedere aanwijzing is onderworpen aan de betaling van de voorgeschreven taks binnen de voorgeschreven termijn.   
(3).  Tenzij de aanvrager om een van de andere soorten van bescherming als genoemd in artikel 43 verzoekt, betekent de aanwijzing dat de verlangde bescherming bestaat uit de verlening van een octrooi door of voor de aangewezen Staat. Voor de toepassing van dit lid is artikel 2, (ii) niet van toepassing.   
(4).  Het niet vermelden in het verzoekschrift van de naam van en de andere voorgeschreven gegevens betreffende de uitvinder heeft geen gevolgen in een aangewezen Staat welks nationale wetgeving het verstrekken van zodanige gegevens vereist, doch toestaat dat zij worden verstrekt op een later tijdstip dan dat van de indiening van een nationale aanvrage. Het niet verstrekken van de genoemde gegevens in een afzonderlijke kennisgeving heeft geen gevolgen in een aangewezen Staat welks nationale wetgeving het verstrekken van de genoemde gegevens niet vereist.   

### Artikel  5  

####De beschrijving

De beschrijving dient de uitvinding voldoende duidelijk en volledig weer te geven om door een deskundige te kunnen worden toegepast.  

### Artikel  6  

####De conclusies

De conclusie of conclusies omschrijven datgene waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd. De conclusies dienen duidelijk en beknopt te zijn. Zij dienen volledig steun te vinden in de beschrijving.  

### Artikel  7  

####De tekeningen

(1).  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het tweede lid, onder (ii), zijn tekeningen vereist indien zij nodig zijn voor het begrijpen van de uitvinding.   
(2).  Indien, zonder dat zulks nodig is voor het begrijpen van de uitvinding, de aard van de uitvinding door tekeningen kan worden toegelicht: 

(i) kan de aanvrager zodanige tekeningen bij de indiening in de internationale aanvrage opnemen,  

(ii) kan een aangewezen bureau verlangen dat de aanvrager binnen de voorgeschreven termijn zodanige tekeningen bij hem indient.     

### Artikel  8  

####Beroep op een recht van voorrang

(1).  De internationale aanvrage kan een verklaring bevatten, zoals voorgeschreven in het Reglement, waarin een beroep op een recht van voorrang wordt gedaan op grond van één of meer aanvragen, die eerder zijn ingediend in of voor een land dat partij is bij het [Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).   
(2).  

a) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder *b)* zijn de vereisten voor en de rechtsgevolgen van een ingevolge het eerste lid gedaan beroep op een recht van voorrang die, welke zijn voorzien in artikel 4 van de Akte van Stockholm van het [Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).  

b) De internationale aanvrage waarvoor een beroep wordt gedaan op het recht van voorrang op grond van een of meer aanvragen, die eerder in of voor een Verdragsluitende Staat zijn ingediend, kan de aanwijzing van die Staat bevatten. Indien in de internationale aanvrage een beroep wordt gedaan op het recht van voorrang op grond van een of meer nationale aanvragen, ingediend in of voor een aangewezen Staat of indien een beroep wordt gedaan op het recht van voorrang van een internationale aanvrage waarin slechts één Staat is aangewezen, worden de vereisten voor en de rechtsgevolgen van het beroep op het recht van voorrang in die Staat geregeld door de nationale wetgeving van die Staat.     

### Artikel  9  

####De aanvrager

(1).  Elke inwoner of onderdaan van een Verdragsluitende Staat kan een internationale aanvrage indienen.   
(2).  De Algemene Vergadering kan besluiten de inwoners en onderdanen van een land, dat partij is bij het [Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md), maar dat geen Partij is bij het onderhavige Verdrag, toe te staan internationale aanvragen in te dienen.   
(3).  De begrippen woonplaats en nationaliteit en de toepassing van deze begrippen ingeval er meer dan één aanvrager is of ingeval de aanvragers niet dezelfde zijn voor alle aangewezen Staten, worden omschreven in het Reglement.   

### Artikel  10  

####Het ontvangende bureau

De internationale aanvrage wordt ingediend bij het voorgeschreven ontvangende bureau, dat de aanvrage zal controleren en verder behandelen zoals bepaald in dit Verdrag en in het Reglement.  

### Artikel  11  

####Dagtekening van depot en rechtsgevolgen van de internationale aanvrage

(1).  Het ontvangende bureau kent als dagtekening van het internationale depot de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage toe, mits dat bureau heeft vastgesteld, dat op het tijdstip van ontvangst: 

(i) de aanvrager niet wegens zijn woonplaats of nationaliteit klaarblijkelijk onbevoegd is een internationale aanvrage bij het ontvangende bureau in te dienen;  

(ii) de internationale aanvrage in de voorgeschreven taal is gesteld;  

(iii) de internationale aanvrage ten minste de volgende elementen bevat:

b) Indien de aanvrager aan het verzoek voldoet, zoals bepaald in het Reglement, kent het ontvangende bureau als dagtekening van het internationale depot de datum van ontvangst van de vereiste verbetering toe.     
(3).  Onverminderd artikel 64, vierde lid, zijn aan internationale aanvragen die voldoen aan de vereisten, opgesomd in het eerste lid, onder (i) tot en met (iii) en waaraan een dagtekening van het internationale depot is toegekend de rechtsgevolgen verbonden van een regelmatige nationale aanvrage in elke aangewezen Staat met ingang van de dagtekening van het internationale depot die als de werkelijke dagtekening van het depot in elke aangewezen Staat geldt.   
(4).  Een internationale aanvrage die voldoet aan de vereisten, opgesomd in het eerste lid onder (i) tot en met (iii), is gelijkwaardig aan een regelmatig nationaal depot in de zin van het [Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).

(2).  Indien de internationale aanvrage verwijst naar tekeningen die in feite niet in die aanvrage zijn opgenomen, geeft het ontvangende bureau de aanvrager daarvan kennis en de aanvrager kan het bureau binnen de voorgeschreven termijn die tekeningen verstrekken en indien hij zulks doet is de dagtekening van het internationale depot de datum waarop de tekeningen door het ontvangende bureau worden ontvangen. In het andere geval wordt een verwijzing naar de genoemde tekeningen als ongedaan beschouwd.   
(3).  

a) Indien het ontvangende bureau vaststelt dat de taksen voorgeschreven ingevolge artikel 3, vierde lid, onder (iv), niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijnen zijn betaald of geen taks voorgeschreven ingevolge artikel 4, tweede lid, is betaald met betrekking tot welke aangewezen Staat ook, wordt de internationale aanvrage als ingetrokken beschouwd en verklaart het ontvangende bureau dit.

### Artikel  15  

####Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek

(1).  Elke internationale aanvrage wordt aan een internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek onderworpen.   
(2).  Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek heeft ten doel de van belang zijnde stand van de techniek na te gaan.   
(3).  Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek geschiedt op grond van de conclusies, met inachtneming van de beschrijving en de mogelijke tekeningen.   
(4).  De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek bedoeld in artikel 16 tracht zoveel van de van belang zijnde stand van de techniek te vinden als haar mogelijkheden toelaten en raadpleegt in elk geval de in het Reglement aangegeven documentatie.   
(5).  

a) Indien de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staat zulks toelaat, kan de aanvrager die een nationale aanvrage indient bij het nationale bureau van of optredend voor een zodanige Staat, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van deze wetgeving, verzoeken met betrekking tot een zodanige aanvrage een nieuwheidsonderzoek te verrichten dat gelijksoortig is met een internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek („nieuwheidsonderzoek van internationaal type”).  

b) Indien de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staat zulks toelaat kan het nationale bureau van of optredend voor een zodanige Staat een bij hem ingediende nationale aanvrage aan een nieuwheidsonderzoek van internationaal type onderwerpen.  

c) Het nieuwheidsonderzoek van internationaal type wordt verricht door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, bedoeld in artikel 16, die bevoegd zou zijn voor een internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek indien de nationale aanvrage een internationale aanvrage zou zijn en zou zijn ingediend bij het bureau bedoeld onder *a)* en *b)*. Indien de nationale aanvrage is gesteld in een taal, waarin de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek zich niet in staat acht die aanvrage te behandelen, wordt het nieuwheidsonderzoek van internationaal type verricht op basis van een vertaling die door de aanvrager is opgesteld in een voor internationale aanvragen voorgeschreven taal die de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek op zich heeft genomen voor internationale aanvragen te aanvaarden. De nationale aanvrage en de eventueel vereiste vertaling worden ingediend in de voor internationale aanvragen voorgeschreven vorm.     

### Artikel  16  

####De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek

(1).  Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt verricht door een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek die een nationaal bureau of een intergouvernementele organisatie kan zijn, zoals het Internationaal Octrooi Instituut, tot welks taken behoort het opstellen van verslagen omtrent nieuwheidsonderzoek in de literatuur naar de stand van de techniek met betrekking tot uitvindingen die het voorwerp van aanvragen zijn.   
(2).  Indien er, hangende de oprichting van één enkele Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, verscheidene instanties voor internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek zijn, wijst elk ontvangend bureau, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de van toepassing zijnde overeenkomst, bedoeld in het derde lid, onder *b)*, de Instantie of Instanties voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek aan die bevoegd zijn tot het nieuwheidsonderzoek van bij een zodanig bureau ingediende internationale aanvragen.   
(3).  

a) Instanties voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek worden aangewezen door de Algemene Vergadering. Nationale bureaus en intergouvernementele organisaties die voldoen aan de vereisten vermeld onder *c)* kunnen worden aangewezen tot Instantie voor internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

b) De aanwijzing is afhankelijk van de instemming van het nationale bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie dat (die) moet worden aangewezen en van de sluiting van een overeenkomst, onderworpen aan de goedkeuring van de Algemene Vergadering, tussen een zodanig bureau of een zodanige organisatie en het Internationale Bureau. De overeenkomst omschrijft de rechten en verplichtingen van de partijen, in het bijzonder de formele verbintenis van genoemd bureau of genoemde organisatie om alle gemeenschappelijke regels van het internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek toe te passen en in acht te nemen.  

c) Het Reglement bepaalt de minimumvereisten, in het bijzonder ten aanzien van de personeelssterkte en het documentatiemateriaal, waaraan een bureau of organisatie moet voldoen voordat het of zij kan worden aangewezen en waaraan het of zij moet blijven voldoen zolang de aanwijzing van kracht blijft.  

d) De aanwijzing geldt voor een vaste termijn en kan met nieuwe termijnen worden verlengd.  

e) Voordat de Algemene Vergadering een besluit neemt over de aanwijzing van een nationaal bureau of een intergouvernementele organisatie, of over de verlenging van een zodanige aanwijzing, of voordat een zodanige aanwijzing laat vervallen, hoort de Algemene Vergadering het betrokken bureau of de betrokken organisatie en wint zij het advies in van de Commissie voor technische samenwerking genoemd in artikel 56, zodra deze Commissie in het leven is geroepen.     

### Artikel  17  

####Procedure voor de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek

(1).  De procedure voor de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt geregeld door de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, het Reglement en de overeenkomst die het Internationale Bureau, met inachtneming van dit Verdrag en het Reglement, met de genoemde Instantie sluit.   
(2).  

a) Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek van oordeel is 

(i) dat de internationale aanvrage betrekking heeft op een onderwerp waarover de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek niet ingevolge het Reglement een nieuwheidsonderzoek behoeft te verrichten, of  

(ii) dat de beschrijving, de conclusies of de tekeningen niet voldoen aan de voorgeschreven vereisten en wel in die mate dat geen zinvol nieuwheidsonderzoek verricht zou kunnen worden,   verklaart genoemde Instantie dit en stelt zij de aanvrager en het Internationale Bureau ervan in kennis dat er geen verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek zal worden opgesteld.  

b) Indien een van de omstandigheden genoemd onder *a)* alleen in verband met bepaalde conclusies aanwezig wordt geacht, vermeldt het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek dit met betrekking tot zodanige conclusies, terwijl voor de andere conclusies genoemd verslag wordt opgesteld zoals bepaald in artikel 18.     
(3).  

a) Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek van oordeel is dat de internationale aanvrage niet voldoet aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding zoals neergelegd in het Reglement, verzoekt zij de aanvrager extra taksen te betalen. De Instantie voor internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek stelt het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek op voor die delen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op de uitvinding die als eerste in de conclusies is genoemd („hoofduitvinding”) en, mits de vereiste extra taksen binnen de voorgeschreven termijn zijn betaald, voor die delen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op uitvindingen waarvoor de genoemde taksen zijn betaald.  

b) De nationale wetgeving van een aangewezen Staat kan bepalen dat, indien het nationale bureau van die Staat het onder *a)* bedoelde verzoek van de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek gerechtvaardigd acht en indien de aanvrager niet alle extra taksen heeft betaald, die delen van de internationale aanvrage waarvoor bijgevolg geen nieuwheidsonderzoek is verricht, voor zover het de gevolgen in die Staat betreft, als ingetrokken worden beschouwd, tenzij door de aanvrager aan het nationale bureau van die Staat een speciale taks wordt betaald.     

### Artikel  18  

####Het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek

(1).  Het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt binnen de voorgeschreven termijn en in de voorgeschreven vorm opgesteld.   
(2).  Het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt, zodra het is opgesteld, door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek toegezonden aan de aanvrager en aan het Internationale Bureau.   
(3).  Het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek of de verklaring bedoeld in artikel 17, tweede lid, onder *a)*, wordt vertaald zoals bepaald in het Reglement. De vertalingen worden gemaakt door of onder verantwoordelijkheid van het Internationale Bureau.   

### Artikel  19  

####Wijziging van de conclusies die aan het Internationale Bureau zijn voorgelegd

(1).  De aanvrager is, na ontvangst van het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek, bevoegd éénmaal de conclusies van de internationale aanvrage te wijzigen door binnen de voorgeschreven termijn bij het Internationale Bureau wijzigingen in te dienen. Tegelijkertijd kan hij een korte verklaring indienen, zoals bepaald in het Reglement, waarin de wijzigingen worden toegelicht en de gevolgen worden aangegeven die zodanige wijzigingen zouden kunnen hebben voor de beschrijving en de tekeningen.   
(2).  De wijzigingen mogen niet buiten het kader van de uiteenzetting in de internationale aanvrage, zoals zij is ingediend, vallen.   
(3).  Indien de nationale wetgeving van een aangewezen Staat wijzigingen toestaat die buiten het kader van de genoemde uiteenzetting vallen heeft het niet voldoen aan het tweede lid geen gevolgen in die Staat.   

### Artikel  20  

####Toezending aan aangewezen bureaus

(1).  

a) De internationale aanvrage, vergezeld van het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek (met inbegrip van de aanduidingen bedoeld in artikel 17, tweede lid, onder *b)* of de verklaring bedoeld in artikel 17, tweede lid, onder *a)*, wordt toegezonden aan elk aangewezen bureau, zoals bepaald in het Reglement, tenzij het aangewezen bureau geheel of gedeeltelijk afstand doet van het voldoen aan een zodanig vereiste.  

b) Eveneens wordt toegezonden de vertaling (zoals voorgeschreven) van het genoemde verslag of de genoemde verklaring.     
(2).  Indien de conclusies zijn gewijzigd ingevolge artikel 19, eerste lid, wordt toegezonden hetzij de volledige tekst zowel van de ingediende als van de gewijzigde conclusies, hetzij de volledige tekst van de conclusies zoals die is ingediend met vermelding van de wijzigingen, en voorts de eventuele verklaring bedoeld in artikel 19, eerste lid.   
(3).  Op verzoek van het aangewezen bureau of van de aanvrager zendt de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek genoemd bureau, onderscheidenlijk de aanvrager, afschriften toe van de literatuurplaatsen, aangehaald in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek, zoals bepaald in het Reglement.

(5).  Er vindt geen internationale publikatie plaats, indien de internationale aanvrage is ingetrokken of als ingetrokken wordt beschouwd voordat de technische voorbereidingen voor publikatie zijn voltooid.   
(6).  Indien de internationale aanvrage uitdrukkingen of tekeningen bevat die naar het oordeel van het Internationale Bureau in strijd zijn met de goede zeden of de openbare orde of indien naar zijn oordeel de internationale aanvrage kleinerende opmerkingen bevat, zoals omschreven in het Reglement, kan het zodanige uitdrukkingen, tekeningen en opmerkingen uit haar publikaties weglaten, met vermelding van de plaats en het aantal woorden of tekeningen dat is weggelaten en kan het op verzoek afzonderlijke afschriften van de weggelaten passages verstrekken.   

### Artikel  22  

####Afschrift, vertaling en taks aan aangewezen bureaus

1.  Uiterlijk tot het tijdstip waarop 30 maanden vanaf de datum van voorrang zijn verstreken, verstrekt de aanvrager elk aangewezen bureau een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage (tenzij de toezending voorzien in artikel 20 reeds heeft plaatsgevonden) en een vertaling daarvan (zoals voorgeschreven) en betaalt hij de (eventuele) nationale taks. Wanneer de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat de vermelding van de naam van en andere voorgeschreven gegevens betreffende de uitvinder vereist, maar toelaat dat deze gegevens worden verstrekt op een later tijdstip dan dat van de indiening van een nationale aanvrage, verstrekt de aanvrager, tenzij de gegevens in het verzoekschrift waren vervat, deze uiterlijk tot het tijdstip waarop 30 maanden vanaf de datum van voorrang zijn verstreken, aan het nationale bureau van of optredend voor die Staat.   
2.  Wanneer de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek een verklaring ingevolge artikel 17, tweede lid, onderdeel a, aflegt, dat er geen verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek zal worden opgesteld, is de termijn voor het verrichten van de handelingen bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel gelijk aan die voorzien in het eerste lid.   
3.  In de nationale wetgevingen kunnen, voor het verrichten van de handelingen bedoeld in het eerste of het tweede lid, termijnen worden vastgesteld die later verstrijken dan de in deze leden bepaalde termijn.   

### Artikel  23  

####Uitstel van de nationale procedure

(1).  Een aangewezen bureau behandelt of beoordeelt de internationale aanvrage niet vóór het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 geldende termijn.   
(2).  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in het eerste lid kan een aangewezen bureau, op uitdrukkelijk verzoek van de aanvrager, de internationale aanvrage te allen tijde behandelen of beoordelen.   

### Artikel  24  

####Mogelijk te niet gaan van de rechtsgevolgen in aangewezen Staten

(1).  Onverminderd - in het onder (ii) genoemde geval - de bepalingen van artikel 25, gaan de rechtsgevolgen van de internationale aanvrage zoals bepaald in artikel 11, derde lid, in een aangewezen Staat te niet met dezelfde gevolgen als de intrekking van een nationale aanvrage in die Staat: 

(i) indien de aanvrager zijn internationale aanvrage of de aanwijzing van die Staat intrekt;  

(ii) indien de internationale aanvrage als ingetrokken wordt beschouwd krachtens artikel 12, derde lid, 14, eerste lid, onder *b)*, 14, derde lid, onder *d)* of 14, vierde lid, of indien de aanwijzing van die Staat als ingetrokken wordt beschouwd krachtens artikel 14, derde lid, onder *b)*;  

(iii) indien de aanvrager nalaat binnen de geldende termijn de handelingen te verrichten bedoeld in artikel 22.     
(2).  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het eerste lid kan elk aangewezen bureau de rechtsgevolgen bepaald in artikel 11, derde lid, handhaven zelfs indien zodanige rechtsgevolgen niet behoeven te worden gehandhaafd krachtens artikel 25, tweede lid.   

### Artikel  25  

####Beoordeling door aangewezen bureaus

(1).  

a) Indien het ontvangende bureau heeft geweigerd een dagtekening van internationaal depot toe te kennen of heeft verklaard dat de internationale aanvrage als ingetrokken wordt beschouwd, of indien het Internationale Bureau een gevolgtrekking ingevolge artikel 12, derde lid, heeft gemaakt, zendt het Internationale Bureau onverwijld, op verzoek van de aanvrager, afschriften van enig document dat zich in het dossier bevindt, aan een door de aanvrager genoemd aangewezen bureau.  

b) Indien het ontvangende bureau heeft verklaard, dat de aanwijzing van een bepaalde Staat als ingetrokken wordt beschouwd, zendt het Internationale Bureau onverwijld, op verzoek van de aanvrager, afschriften van enig document dat zich in het dossier bevindt, aan het nationale bureau van die Staat.  

c) Het verzoek op grond van het bepaalde onder *a)* of *b)* wordt voorgelegd binnen de voorgeschreven termijn.     
(2).  

a) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder *b)*, besluit elk aangewezen bureau, mits binnen de voorgeschreven termijn de (eventuele) nationale taks is betaald en de passende vertaling (zoals voorgeschreven) is verstrekt, of de weigering, verklaring of gevolgtrekking bedoeld in het eerste lid gerechtvaardigd was ingevolge de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en van het Reglement en, indien het tot de gevolgtrekking komt dat de weigering of verklaring voortvloeide uit een vergissing of een verzuim van het ontvangende bureau of dat de gevolgtrekking voortvloeide uit een vergissing of een verzuim van het Internationale Bureau, behandelt het de internationale aanvrage, voor zover het gevolgen in de Staat van het aangewezen bureau betreft, alsof een zodanige vergissing of een zodanig verzuim zich niet had voorgedaan.  

b) Indien het oorspronkelijke exemplaar het Internationale Bureau heeft bereikt na het verstrijken van de termijn, voorgeschreven ingevolge artikel 12, derde lid, wegens een vergissing of een verzuim van de aanvrager, is het bepaalde onder *a)* alleen van toepassing onder de omstandigheden bedoeld in artikel 48, tweede lid.     

### Artikel  26  

####Gelegenheid tot verbetering ten overstaan van de aangewezen bureaus

Een aangewezen bureau mag een internationale aanvrage niet afwijzen op de grond dat niet aan de vereisten van dit Verdrag en van het Reglement is voldaan zonder de aanvrager eerst in de gelegenheid te stellen genoemde aanvrage te verbeteren in de mate en overeenkomstig de procedure in de nationale wetgeving bepaald voor dezelfde of vergelijkbare omstandigheden ten aanzien van nationale aanvragen.  

### Artikel  27  

####Nationale vereisten

(1).  Geen nationale wetgeving mag de eis stellen dat wordt voldaan aan vereisten betreffende de vorm of de inhoud van de internationale aanvrage die afwijken van of toegevoegd worden aan de vereisten die in dit Verdrag en in het Reglement zijn gesteld.   
(2).  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van invloed op de toepassing van het bepaalde in artikel 7, tweede lid, en sluiten evenmin uit dat een nationale wetgeving, zodra de behandeling van de internationale aanvrage in het aangewezen bureau is begonnen, eist dat worden verstrekt: 

(i) indien de aanvrager een rechtspersoon is, de naam van een functionaris die bevoegd is die rechtspersoon te vertegenwoordigen,  

(ii) documenten die geen deel van de internationale aanvrage uitmaken, maar die het bewijs vormen van stellingen of verklaringen in die aanvrage gedaan, met inbegrip van de bevestiging van de internationale aanvrage door de handtekening van de aanvrager wanneer die aanvrage, zoals ingediend, was ondertekend door zijn vertegenwoordiger of gemachtigde.     
(3).  Indien ten opzichte van een aangewezen Staat de aanvrager overeenkomstig de nationale wetgeving van die Staat niet bevoegd is om een nationale aanvrage in te dienen omdat hij niet de uitvinder is, kan de internationale aanvrage door het aangewezen bureau worden afgewezen.   
(4).  Indien de nationale wetgeving ten aanzien van de vorm of de inhoud van nationale aanvragen eisen stelt, die, vanuit het standpunt van de aanvragers, gunstiger zijn dan de bij dit Verdrag en het Reglement ten aanzien van internationale aanvragen gestelde eisen, kunnen het nationale bureau, de rechterlijke colleges en andere bevoegde organen van of optredend voor de aangewezen Staat op internationale aanvragen de eerstgenoemde eisen toepassen in plaats van de laatstgenoemde, behalve indien de aanvrager aandringt op de toepassing op zijn internationale aanvrage van de bij dit Verdrag en het Reglement gestelde eisen.   
(5).  Niets in dit Verdrag en het Reglement mag zo worden uitgelegd, dat daardoor iets wordt voorgeschreven dat de vrijheid van elke Verdragsluitende Staat zou beperken om de materiële vereisten voor octrooieerbaarheid voor te schrijven die hij wenst. In het bijzonder dienen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en het Reglement betreffende de omschrijving van de stand van de techniek uitsluitend de internationale procedure en iedere Verdragsluitende Staat is derhalve vrij om, bij de bepaling van de octrooieerbaarheid van een uitvinding waarvoor in een internationale aanvrage uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, de maatstaven van zijn nationale wetgeving toe te passen ten aanzien van de stand van de techniek en andere vereisten voor de octrooieerbaarheid, voor zover die geen voorschrift inhouden ten aanzien van de vorm en de inhoud van aanvragen.   
(6).  De nationale wetgeving kan eisen dat de aanvrager bewijs levert ten aanzien van bij die wetgeving voorgeschreven materiële vereisten voor de octrooieerbaarheid.   
(7).  Elk ontvangend bureau of, wanneer de behandeling van de internationale aanvrage in het aangewezen bureau is begonnen, dat bureau, kan de nationale wetgeving toepassen voor zover deze betrekking heeft op de verplichte vertegenwoordiging van de aanvrager door een gemachtigde die gerechtigd is aanvragers voor het genoemde bureau te vertegenwoordigen en/of op de verplichte aanwijzing van een adres in de aangewezen Staat voor het ontvangen van kennisgevingen.   
(8).  Niets in dit Verdrag en het Reglement mag worden uitgelegd als een beperking van de vrijheid van een Verdragsluitende Staat om maatregelen toe te passen die noodzakelijk worden geacht voor het bewaren van zijn nationale veiligheid of om, ter bescherming van de algemene economische belangen van die Staat, het recht van zijn eigen inwoners of onderdanen internationale aanvragen in te dienen, te beperken.   

### Artikel  28  

####Wijzigingen van de conclusies, de beschrijving en de tekeningen ten overstaan van aangewezen bureaus

(1).  De aanvrager wordt in de gelegenheid gesteld de conclusies, de beschrijving en de tekeningen ten overstaan van elk aangewezen bureau binnen de voorgeschreven termijn te wijzigen. Een aangewezen bureau verleent geen octrooi of weigert niet een octrooi te verlenen, voordat een zodanige termijn is verstreken, behalve met de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de aanvrager.   
(2).  De wijzigingen mogen niet buiten het kader van de uiteenzetting in de ingediende internationale aanvrage vallen, tenzij de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat het toelaat.   
(3).  De wijzigingen dienen op alle punten waarin dit Verdrag en het Reglement niet voorzien, in overeenstemming te zijn met de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat.   
(4).  Indien een aangewezen bureau een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage verlangt, dienen de wijzigingen in de taal van de vertaling te zijn gesteld.   

### Artikel  29  

####Rechtsgevolgen van de internationale publikatie

(1).  Voor zover het de bescherming van enig recht van de aanvrager in een aangewezen Staat betreft, zijn de rechtsgevolgen in die Staat van de internationale publikatie van een internationale aanvrage, onverminderd het bepaalde in het tweede tot en met het vierde lid, dezelfde als die welke de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat verbindt aan de verplichte nationale publikatie van niet beoordeelde nationale aanvragen als zodanig.   
(2).  Indien de taal waarin de internationale publikatie is gesteld een andere is dan de taal waarin publikaties krachtens de nationale wetgeving in de aangewezen Staat worden gesteld, kan genoemde nationale wetgeving bepalen dat de rechtsgevolgen bedoeld in het eerste lid alleen intreden vanaf het tijdstip waarop: 

(i) een vertaling in laatstgenoemde taal is gepubliceerd zoals bepaald bij de nationale wetgeving, of  

(ii) een vertaling in laatstgenoemde taal ter inzage voor het publiek beschikbaar is gesteld, zoals bepaald in de nationale wetgeving, of  

(iii) een vertaling in de laatstgenoemde taal door de aanvrager is toegezonden aan de feitelijke of vermoedelijke onbevoegde gebruiker van de uitvinding waarvoor in de internationale aanvrage uitsluitende rechten zijn verlangd, of  

(iv) de beide handelingen genoemd onder (i) en (iii) of de beide handelingen genoemd onder (ii) en (iii) hebben plaatsgevonden.     
(3).  De nationale wetgeving van een aangewezen Staat kan bepalen dat, wanneer de internationale publikatie op verzoek van de aanvrager is verricht voordat 18 maanden zijn verstreken te rekenen van de datum van voorrang, de rechtsgevolgen bedoeld in het eerste lid slechts zullen intreden na het verstrijken van 18 maanden te rekenen van de datum van voorrang.   
(4).  De nationale wetgeving van een aangewezen Staat kan bepalen dat de rechtsgevolgen bedoeld in het eerste lid slechts zullen intreden vanaf de datum waarop een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage gepubliceerd ingevolge artikel 21 bij het nationale bureau van of optredend voor deze Staat is ontvangen. Het genoemde bureau maakt de datum van ontvangst zo spoedig mogelijk bekend in zijn mededelingenblad.   

### Artikel  30  

####Vertrouwelijke aard van de internationale aanvrage

(1).  

a) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder *b)* geven het Internationale Bureau en de Instanties voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek aan geen persoon of instantie toegang tot de internationale aanvrage voordat de internationale publikatie van die aanvrage is verricht, tenzij zulks is verzocht of daartoe machtiging is verleend door de aanvrager.  

b) Het bepaalde onder *a)* is niet van toepassing op toezendingen aan de bevoegde Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, op de toezendingen ingevolge artikel 13 en op mededelingen ingevolge artikel 20.     
(2).  

a) Een nationaal bureau geeft aan derden geen toegang tot de internationale aanvrage, tenzij zulks is verzocht of daartoe machtiging is verleend door de aanvrager, vóór de eerste van de onderstaande tijdstippen: 

(i) de datum van de internationale publikatie van de internationale aanvrage,  

(ii) de datum van ontvangst van de mededeling van de internationale aanvrage ingevolge artikel 20,  

(iii) de datum van ontvangst van een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage ingevolge artikel 22.    

b) Het bepaalde onder *a)* belet een nationaal bureau niet derden ervan in kennis te stellen dat het is aangewezen of dit feit bekend te maken. Een zodanige inlichting of bekendmaking mag evenwel slechts de volgende gegevens bevatten: identificatie van het ontvangende bureau, naam van de aanvrager, datum van de internationale indiening, nummer van de internationale aanvrage en titel van de uitvinding.  

c) Het bepaalde onder *a)* belet een aangewezen bureau niet de gerechtelijke autoriteiten toegang tot de internationale aanvrage te geven.     
(3).  Het bepaalde in het tweede lid, onder *a)*, is van toepassing op elk ontvangend bureau behalve voor zover het toezendingen ingevolge artikel 12, eerste lid, betreft.   
(4).  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvat de uitdrukking „toegang” alle middelen waardoor derden kennis kunnen verkrijgen, met inbegrip van individuele mededeling en algemene bekendmaking, met dien verstande evenwel dat een nationaal bureau een internationale aanvrage of de vertaling daarvan niet vóór de internationale publikatie algemeen openbaar maakt of, indien de internationale publikatie niet heeft plaats gevonden na het verstrijken van 20 maanden te rekenen van de datum van voorrang, vóór het verstrijken van 20 maanden vanaf genoemde datum van voorrang.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Internationale voorlopige beoordeling

### Artikel  31  

####Verzoek om internationale voorlopige beoordeling

(1).  Op verzoek van de aanvrager wordt zijn internationale aanvrage onderworpen aan een internationale voorlopige beoordeling zoals voorzien in de onderstaande bepalingen en in het Reglement.   
(2).  

a) Een aanvrager die, zoals omschreven in het Reglement, inwoner of onderdaan is van een Verdragsluitende Staat die gebonden is door Hoofdstuk II en wiens internationale aanvrage is ingediend bij het ontvangende bureau van of optredend voor die Staat kan een verzoek tot een internationale voorlopige beoordeling indienen.  

b) De Algemene Vergadering kan besluiten, dat personen bevoegd tot het indienen van internationale aanvragen wordt toegestaan een verzoek te doen tot een internationale voorlopige beoordeling, zelfs indien zij inwoners of onderdanen zijn van een Staat die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag of die niet is gebonden door Hoofdstuk II.     
(3).  Het verzoek tot een internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt gescheiden van de internationale aanvrage ingediend. Het verzoek dient de voorgeschreven gegevens te bevatten en in de voorgeschreven taal en vorm te zijn gesteld.   
(4).  

a) Het verzoek vermeldt de Verdragsluitende Staat of Staten waarin de aanvrager voornemens is de resultaten van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling te gebruiken („gekozen Staten”). Bijkomende Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen later worden gekozen. De keuze kan alleen betrekking hebben op reeds krachtens artikel 4 aangewezen Verdragsluitende Staten.  

b) Aanvragers bedoeld in het tweede lid, onder *a)*, kunnen elke Verdragsluitende Staat kiezen die gebonden is door Hoofdstuk II. Aanvragers bedoeld in het tweede lid onder *b)*, kunnen alleen die door Hoofdstuk II gebonden Verdragsluitende Staten kiezen, die hebben verklaard dat zij bereid zijn door zodanige aanvragers te worden gekozen.     
(5).  Het verzoek is onderworpen aan de betaling van de voorgeschreven taksen binnen de voorgeschreven termijn.   
(6).  

a) Het verzoek wordt ingediend bij de bevoegde Instantie voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling bedoeld in artikel 32.

### Artikel  32  

####De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling

(1).  De internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt verricht door de Instantie voor Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.   
(2).  In het geval van verzoeken zoals bedoeld in artikel 31, tweede lid, onder *a)*, wordt door het ontvangende bureau en, in het geval van verzoeken als bedoeld in artikel 31, tweede lid, onder *b)*, wordt (worden) door de Algemene Vergadering, overeenkomstig de van toepassing zijnde overeenkomst tussen de betrokken Instantie of Instanties voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling en het Internationale Bureau, de Instantie of Instanties voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling aangewezen die bevoegd zijn de voorlopige beoordeling te verrichten.   
(3).  Het bepaalde in artikel 1.6, derde lid, is van overeenkomstige toepassing op de Instanties voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.   

### Artikel  33  

####De internationale voorlopige beoordeling

(1).  Het doel van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling is een voorlopig oordeel zonder verplichting te formuleren over de vragen of de uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, nieuw lijkt, op uitvinderswerkzaamheid lijkt te berusten, (niet voor de hand lijkt te liggen) en vatbaar lijkt voor toepassing op het gebied van de nijverheid.   
(2).  Voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt een uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, als nieuw beschouwd indien zij niet bekend is uit de stand van de techniek zoals omschreven in het Reglement.   
(3).  Voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt een uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, beschouwd op uitvinderswerkzaamheid te berusten indien zij, met inachtneming van de stand van de techniek zoals omschreven in het Reglement niet, op het voorgeschreven toepasselijke tijdstip, voor een deskundige voor de hand ligt.   
(4).  Voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt aangenomen dat een uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, vatbaar is voor toepassing op het gebied van de nijverheid, indien zij, al naar haar aard, kan worden vervaardigd of toegepast (in technologische zin) op enig gebied van de nijverheid. „Nijverheid” wordt opgevat in de ruimste zin, zoals in het [Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).   
(5).  De hiervoor beschreven maatstaven gelden alleen voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling. Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan bijkomende of andere maatstaven toepassen voor de beslissing of de uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, in die Staat al dan niet octrooieerbaar is.   
(6).  Bij de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt rekening gehouden met alle in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek aangehaalde litteratuurplaatsen. Er kan rekening worden gehouden met alle andere litteratuurplaatsen die in het desbetreffende geval van belang worden geacht.   

### Artikel  34  

####Procedure voor de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling

(1).  De procedure voor de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling wordt geregeld door de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, van het Reglement en van de overeenkomst die het Internationale Bureau, met inachtneming van dit Verdrag en van het Reglement, met de genoemde Instantie sluit.   
(2).  

a) De aanvrager heeft het recht mondeling en schriftelijk in contact te treden met de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

b) De aanvrager heeft het recht de conclusies, de beschrijving en de tekeningen op de voorgeschreven wijze en binnen de voorgeschreven termijn te wijzigen, voordat het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt opgesteld. De wijziging mag niet buiten het kader van de uiteenzetting in de ingediende internationale aanvrage vallen.  

c) De aanvrager ontvangt ten minste één schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, tenzij deze Instantie van mening is dat aan alle onderstaande vereisten is voldaan: 

(i) de uitvinding voldoet aan de maatstaven vermeld in artikel 33, eerste lid,  

(ii) de internationale aanvrage voldoet aan de eisen van dit Verdrag en van het Reglement voor zover nagegaan door deze Instantie,  

(iii) er bestaat geen voornemen tot het maken van opmerkingen ingevolge artikel 35, tweede lid, laatste zin.    

d) De aanvrager kan reageren op het schriftelijke oordeel.     
(3).  

a) Indien de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling van oordeel is dat de internationale aanvrage niet voldoet aan de eis van eenheid van uitvinding zoals vermeld in het Reglement, kan zij de aanvrager verzoeken naar keuze de conclusies te beperken om zo te voldoen aan de eis, of aanvullende taksen te betalen.  

b) De nationale wetgeving van een gekozen Staat kan bepalen dat, indien de aanvrager verkiest de conclusies te beperken overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder *a)*, die delen van de internationale aanvrage die, tengevolge van de beperking, niet aan een internationale voorlopige beoordeling zullen worden onderworpen, voor zover het rechtsgevolgen in die Staat betreft, als ingetrokken worden beschouwd, tenzij de aanvrager een bijzondere taks betaalt aan het nationale bureau van die Staat.  

c) Indien de aanvrager niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn voldoet aan het verzoek bedoeld onder *a)*, stelt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling een verslag op van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling over die delen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op wat de hoofduitvinding lijkt te zijn en vermeldt zij de van belang zijnde feiten in het genoemde verslag. De nationale wetgeving van een gekozen Staat kan bepalen dat, wanneer zijn nationale bureau het verzoek van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling gerechtvaardigd acht, die delen van de internationale aanvrage die geen betrekking hebben op de hoofduitvinding, voor zover het rechtsgevolgen in die Staat betreft, als ingetrokken worden beschouwd, tenzij de aanvrager een bijzondere taks betaalt aan dat bureau.     
(4).  

a) Indien de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling van oordeel is dat 

(i) de internationale aanvrage betrekking heeft op een onderwerp waarover de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling niet krachtens het Reglement een internationale voorlopige beoordeling behoeft te geven en in dat bijzondere geval besluit een zodanige beoordeling niet te geven, of  

(ii) de beschrijving, de conclusies of de tekeningen zo onduidelijk zijn of de conclusies dusdanig onvoldoende ondersteund worden door de beschrijving dat geen zinvol oordeel kan worden gevormd over de nieuwheid, de uitvinderswerkzaamheid (het niet voor de hand liggen) of het vatbaar zijn voor toepassing op het gebied van de nijverheid van de uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd,   gaat de genoemde Instantie niet in op de vragen bedoeld in artikel 33, eerste lid, en stelt zij de aanvrager in kennis van haar oordeel en de daaraan ten grondslag liggende redenen.  

b) Indien een van de omstandigheden bedoeld onder *a)* slechts aanwezig wordt bevonden ten aanzien van, of in verband met bepaalde conclusies, is het bepaalde onder *a)* alleen op die conclusies van toepassing.     

### Artikel  35  

####Het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling

(1).  Het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt opgesteld binnen de voorgeschreven termijn en in de voorgeschreven vorm.   
(2).  Het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling bevat geen verklaring over de vraag of de uitvinding waarvoor uitsluitende rechten worden verlangd, al dan niet octrooieerbaar is of lijkt overeenkomstig de nationale wetgeving. Het verklaart, met inachtneming van het bepaalde in het derde lid, ten aanzien van elke conclusie, of zij lijkt te voldoen aan de maatstaven van nieuwheid, uitvinderswerkzaamheid (het niet voor de hand liggen) en het vatbaar zijn voor toepassing op het gebied van de nijverheid, zoals deze voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling zijn omschreven in artikel 33, eerste tot en met vierde lid. De verklaring gaat vergezeld van de aanhaling van de literatuurplaatsen waarvan wordt aangenomen dat zij de uiteengezette gevolgtrekking staven met de toelichtingen die de omstandigheden van de zaak mogelijk vereisen. De verklaring gaat tevens vergezeld van eventuele andere opmerkingen zoals bepaald in het Reglement.   
(3).  

a) Indien, op het tijdstip van opstelling van het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling de Instantie voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling van oordeel is dat een van de omstandigheden zoals bedoeld in artikel 34, vierde lid, onder *a)*, bestaat, dient dit verslag haar oordeel en de daaraan ten grondslag liggende redenen te vermelden. Het bevat geen verklaring zoals bepaald in het tweede lid.  

b) Indien een omstandigheid ingevolge artikel 34, vierde lid, onder *b)* wordt bevonden te bestaan, dient het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling ten aanzien van de betrokken conclusies de verklaring zoals voorzien onder *a)* te bevatten, terwijl het, ten aanzien van de andere conclusies, de verklaring zoals voorzien in het tweede lid dient te bevatten.     

### Artikel  36  

####Toezending, vertaling en mededeling van het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling

(2).  

a) Het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling en de bijlagen worden vertaald in de voorgeschreven talen.  

b) Elke vertaling van genoemd verslag wordt gemaakt door of onder de verantwoordelijkheid van het Internationale Bureau, terwijl elke vertaling van de genoemde bijlagen door de aanvrager wordt gemaakt.     
(3).  

a) Het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling, te zamen met de vertaling daarvan (zoals voorgeschreven) en de bijlagen (in de oorspronkelijke taal) worden door het Internationale Bureau toegezonden aan elk gekozen bureau.  

b) De voorgeschreven vertaling van de bijlagen wordt binnen de voorgeschreven termijn door de aanvrager toegezonden aan de gekozen bureaus.     
(4).  Het bepaalde in artikel 20, derde lid, is van overeenkomstige toepassing op afschriften van elke literatuurplaats die in het verslag van internationale voorlopige beoordeling en niet in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek is aangehaald.   

### Artikel  37  

####Intrekking van het verzoek of de keuze

(1).  De aanvrager kan alle of een gedeelte der keuzen intrekken.   
(2).  Indien de keuze van alle gekozen Staten is ingetrokken, wordt het verzoek als ingetrokken beschouwd.   
(3).  

a) Elke intrekking wordt ter kennis gebracht van het Internationale Bureau.  

b) Het Internationale Bureau brengt deze intrekkingen ter kennis van de betrokken gekozen bureaus en de betrokken Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.     
(4).  

a) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder *b)* wordt de intrekking van het verzoek of van de keuze van een Verdragsluitende Staat, tenzij de nationale wetgeving van die Staat anders bepaalt, beschouwd als intrekking van de internationale aanvrage voor zover het die Staat betreft.  

b) Intrekking van het verzoek of van de keuze wordt niet beschouwd als intrekking van de internationale aanvrage, indien deze intrekking geschiedt vóór het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 geldende termijn; elke Verdragsluitende Staat kan evenwel in zijn nationale wetgeving bepalen dat het voorgaande alleen geldt indien zijn nationale bureau binnen genoemde termijn een exemplaar van de internationale aanvrage, te zamen met een vertaling (zoals voorgeschreven) en de nationale taks heeft ontvangen.     

### Artikel  38  

####Vertrouwelijke aard van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling

(1).  Noch het Internationale Bureau noch de Instantie voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling geeft, tenzij daartoe verzocht of gemachtigd door de aanvrager, te eniger tijd toegang in de zin en met het voorbehoud van artikel 30, vierde lid, tot het dossier van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling aan personen of instanties, behalve aan de gekozen bureaus wanneer het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling eenmaal is opgesteld.   
(2).  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het eerste lid en in de artikelen 36, eerste en derde lid, en 37, derde lid, onder *b)* verstrekken noch het Internationale Bureau, noch de Instantie voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling, tenzij daartoe verzocht of gemachtigd door de aanvrager, inlichtingen over het al dan niet uitbrengen van een verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling of over het al dan niet intrekken van het verzoek of van een keuze.   

### Artikel  39  

####Afschrift, vertaling en taks voor de gekozen bureaus

(1).  

a) Indien de keuze van een Verdragsluitende Staat is gedaan vóór het verstrijken van de 19de maand, te rekenen van de datum van voorrang, is het bepaalde in artikel 22 niet van toepassing op deze Staat en verstrekt de aanvrager een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage (tenzij de mededeling krachtens artikel 20 reeds heeft plaatsgevonden en een vertaling daarvan (zoals voorgeschreven) en betaalt hij de (eventuele) nationale taks aan elk gekozen bureau vóór het verstrijken van dertig maanden, te rekenen van de datum van voorrang.  

b) Elke nationale wetgeving kan voor het verrichten van de handelingen bedoeld onder *a)* termijnen vaststellen die later verstrijken dan de onder *a)* bepaalde termijn.     
(2).  Het rechtsgevolg voorzien in artikel 11, derde lid, houdt in de gekozen Staat op te bestaan met dezelfde gevolgen als de intrekking van een nationale aanvrage in die Staat indien de aanvrager nalaat, binnen de termijn van toepassing krachtens het eerste lid, onder *a)* of *b)*, de handelingen te verrichten bedoeld in het eerste lid, onder *a)*.   
(3).  Een gekozen bureau kan het rechtsgevolg, voorzien in artikel 11, derde lid, handhaven, zelfs indien de aanvrager niet voldoet aan de eisen genoemd in het eerste lid, onder *a)* of *b)*.

### Artikel  46  

####Onjuiste vertaling van de internationale aanvrage

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Technische diensten

### Artikel  50  

####Diensten voor inlichtingen inzake octrooien

(1).  Het Internationale Bureau kan diensten verlenen door het verstrekken van technische en andere ter zake dienende inlichtingen waarover het beschikt op grond van gepubliceerde documenten, voornamelijk octrooien en gepubliceerde aanvragen (in dit artikel de „inlichtingendiensten” genoemd).   
(2).  Het Internationale Bureau kan deze inlichtingendiensten rechtstreeks verlenen dan wel door middel van een of meer instanties voor internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek of andere nationale of internationale gespecialiseerde instellingen waarmede het Internationale Bureau een overeenkomst kan sluiten.   
(3).  De inlichtingendiensten dienen op zodanige wijze te functioneren dat zij het met name voor Verdragsluitende Staten die ontwikkelingslanden zijn, gemakkelijk maken technische kennis en technologie, met inbegrip van de beschikbare gepubliceerde „know-how”, te verwerven.   
(4).  De inlichtingendiensten staan ter beschikking van de Regeringen van Verdragsluitende Staten en hun onderdanen en inwoners. De Algemene Vergadering kan besluiten deze diensten ook aan anderen ter beschikking te stellen.   
(5).  

a) Elke dienst aan Regeringen van Verdragsluitende Staten wordt verleend tegen kostprijs, met dien verstande dat indien het de Regering betreft van een Verdragsluitende Staat die een ontwikkelingsland is, de dienst wordt verleend tegen minder dan de kostprijs, indien het verschil kan worden gedekt uit winsten gemaakt op diensten, verleend aan anderen dan Regeringen van Verdragsluitende Staten of uit de middelen bedoeld in artikel 51, vierde lid.  

b) Onder de kostprijs bedoeld onder *a)* dient te worden verstaan de kosten die uitgaan boven die welke normaal verbonden zijn aan het verrichten van de diensten door een nationaal bureau of de vervulling van de verplichtingen door een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek.     
(6).  De bijzonderheden betreffende de uitvoering van het bepaalde in dit artikel worden geregeld door besluiten van de Algemene Vergadering en, binnen de door de Algemene Vergadering vast te stellen grenzen, van de werkgroepen die de Algemene Vergadering voor dit doel kan instellen.

Het aandeel van de Unie in deze gemeenschappelijke uitgaven is evenredig aan het belang dat deze uitgaven voor haar vertegenwoordigen.     
(2).  De begroting van de Unie wordt vastgesteld met inachtneming van de vereisten tot coördinatie met de begrotingen van de andere door de Organisatie beheerde Unies.

c) Indien andere middelen om een tekort of een gedeelte daarvan voorlopig te dekken worden verkregen, kan de Algemene Vergadering besluiten dat dit tekort wordt overgeboekt naar het volgende jaar en dat de Verdragsluitende Staten niet wordt gevraagd bijdragen te betalen.  

d) Indien de financiële situatie van de Unie zulks toelaat kan de Algemene Vergadering besluiten dat krachtens het bepaalde onder *a)* betaalde bijdragen worden terugbetaald aan de Verdragsluitende Staten die deze hebben betaald.  

e) Een Verdragsluitende Staat die niet binnen twee jaar na de door Algemene Vergadering vastgestelde vervaldatum zijn bijdrage krachtens het bepaalde onder *b)* heeft betaald kan in geen der organen Unie zijn stemrecht uitoefenen. Elk orgaan van de Unie kan evenwel zulk een Staat vergunnen zijn stemrecht in dat orgaan te blijven uitoefenen, zolang het ervan overtuigd is dat de achterstalligheid wordt veroorzaakt door uitzonderlijke en onvermijdelijke omstandigheden.

b) Het bedrag van de eerste storting door iedere Verdragsluitende Staat aan genoemd fonds of van zijn deelneming in de bijstorting wordt bepaald door de Algemene Vergadering op grond van overeenkomstige beginselen als die genoemd in het vijfde lid, onder *b)*.  

c) De betalingsvoorwaarden worden vastgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering op voorstel van de Directeur-Generaal en na ingewonnen advies van de Coördinatiecommissie van de Organisatie.  

d) Elke terugbetaling is evenredig aan de door elke Verdragsluitende Staat betaalde bedragen met inachtneming van de tijdstippen waarop zij zijn betaald.     
(8).  

a) In de overeenkomst betreffende de zetelvestiging, gesloten met de Staat op wiens grondgebied de Organisatie haar zetel heeft, wordt bepaald dat, telkens wanneer het operationele fonds niet toereikend is, die Staat voorschotten verstrekt. Het bedrag van deze voorschotten en de voorwaarden waarop zij worden verstrekt, vormen telkenmale het onderwerp van afzonderlijke overeenkomsten tussen deze Staat en de Organisatie. Zolang deze Staat gehouden is voorschotten te verstrekken, beschikt hij van rechtswege over een zetel in de Algemene Vergadering en in de Uitvoerende Commissie.  

b) De Staat bedoeld onder *a)* en de Organisatie hebben elk het recht de verplichting tot het verstrekken van voorschotten schriftelijk op te zeggen. De opzegging wordt van kracht drie jaar na afloop van het jaar waarin de kennisgeving is gedaan.     
(9).  Het nazien der rekeningen wordt verricht, op de wijze voorzien in het financieel reglement, door een of meer Verdragsluitende Staten of door onafhankelijke accountants. Zij worden, met hun instemming, aangewezen door de algemene Vergadering.

(i) hij niet is gebonden door de bepalingen van artikel 39, eerste lid ten aanzien van het verschaffen van een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage en een vertaling daarvan (zoals voorgeschreven),  

(ii) de verplichting de nationale behandeling uit te stellen, zoals voorzien in artikel 40, niet de openbaarmaking van de internationale aanvrage of een vertaling daarvan, door of via zijn nationale bureau belet, met dien verstande evenwel, dat hij niet is vrijgesteld van de verplichtingen, voorzien in de artikelen 30 en 38.    

b) Staten die een zodanige verklaring afleggen zijn dienovereenkomstig gebonden.     
(3).  

a) Een Staat kan verklaren dat, voor zover het hem betreft, internationale openbaarmaking van internationale aanvragen niet vereist is.  

b) Indien, na het verstrijken van 18 maanden van de datum van voorrang, de internationale aanvrage de aanwijzing bevat van alleen die Staten die verklaringen hebben afgelegd als bedoeld onder *a),* wordt de internationale aanvrage niet openbaar gemaakt krachtens artikel 21, tweede lid.  

c) Indien het bepaalde onder *b)* van toepassing is, wordt de internationale aanvrage niettemin door het Internationale Bureau openbaar gemaakt: 

(i) op verzoek van de aanvrager, zoals voorzien in het Reglement,  

(ii) indien een nationale aanvrage of een octrooi, gebaseerd op de internationale aanvrage, openbaar wordt gemaakt door of voor het nationale bureau van enige aangewezen Staat die een verklaring als bedoeld onder *a)* heeft afgelegd, onverwijld na een zodanige openbaarmaking maar niet vóór het verstrijken van 18 maanden te rekenen van de datum van voorrang.       
(4).  

a) Elke Staat waarvan de nationale wetgeving aan zijn octrooien gevolgen wat betreft de stand van de techniek verbindt vanaf de datum voor de openbaarmaking, maar niet voor de bepaling van de stand van de techniek, de datum van voorrang waarop men zich beroept ingevolge het [Verdrag van Parijs tot Bescherming van de Industriële Eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md), gelijkstelt met de werkelijke datum van indiening in die Staat, kan verklaren dat de indiening buiten die Staat van een internationale aanvrage, waarin die Staat is aangewezen, niet gelijk wordt gesteld aan een werkelijke indiening in die Staat voor de bepaling van de stand van de techniek.  

b) Een Staat die een verklaring als bedoeld onder *a)* aflegt, is in zoverre niet gebonden door het bepaalde in artikel 11, derde lid.  

c) Een Staat die een verklaring als bedoeld onder *a)* aflegt, geeft tegelijkertijd schriftelijk aan met ingang van welke datum en onder welke voorwaarden de gevolgen voor de stand van de techniek van internationale aanvragen, waarin die Staat wordt aangewezen, in die Staat van kracht worden. Deze verklaring kan te allen tijde worden gewijzigd door een kennisgeving gericht tot de Directeur-Generaal.

b) Een verklaring afgelegd volgens dit artikel kan te allen tijde worden ingetrokken door middel van een tot de Directeur-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving. Een zodanige intrekking wordt van kracht drie maanden na de dag waarop de Directeur-Generaal de kennisgeving heeft ontvangen en in het geval van de intrekking van een krachtens het derde lid afgelegde verklaring heeft zij geen invloed op internationale aanvragen die zijn ingediend voor het verstrijken van deze termijn van drie maanden.

### Regel  5  

####De beschrijving

5.1.   *Indeling van de beschrijving*  

a) De beschrijving dient eerst de titel van de uitvinding aan te geven zoals vermeld in het verzoekschrift en dient: 

(i) het technische gebied aan te geven waarop de uitvinding betrekking heeft;  

(ii) de technologische achtergrond aan te geven die, voor zover de aanvrager bekend, als nuttig kan worden beschouwd voor het begrip, het nieuwheidsonderzoek en de beoordeling van de uitvinding, en bij voorkeur de literatuurplaatsen waarin deze technologische kennis is vermeld, aan te halen;  

(iii) de uitvinding waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd, uiteen te zetten in zodanige bewoordingen dat het technische vraagstuk (zelfs indien het als zodanig niet uitdrukkelijk is uiteengezet) en de oplossing ervan kunnen worden begrepen, en de mogelijke voordelige gevolgen van de uitvinding tegen de technologische achtergrond aan te geven;  

(iv) een korte beschrijving van de figuren in de mogelijke tekeningen te geven;  

(v) tenminste een uiteenzetting te geven van de beste wijze die door de aanvrager wordt overwogen om de uitvinding waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd in praktijk te brengen; dit moet, waar dienstig, worden gedaan aan de hand van voorbeelden en met verwijzing naar de mogelijke tekeningen; wanneer de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat niet de beschrijving van de beste wijze vereist, maar genoegen neemt met de beschrijving van een wijze (ongeacht of het al of niet de beste is die wordt overwogen), heeft het nalaten van een beschrijving van de overwogen beste wijze in die Staat geen rechtsgevolgen;  

(vi) wanneer dit niet duidelijk uit de beschrijving of de aard van de uitvinding blijkt, uitdrukkelijk de manier aan te geven waarop de uitvinding in de nijverheid kan worden geëxploiteerd en de manier waarop zij kan worden vervaardigd en toegepast, of indien zij alleen kan worden toegepast, de manier waarop zij kan worden toegepast; de uitdrukking „nijverheid” dient te worden verstaan in de ruimste zin zoals in het [Verdrag van Parijs tot Bescherming van de Industriële Eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md).    

b) De indeling en volgorde aangegeven onder paragraaf *a)* dienen te worden aangehouden behalve wanneer, wegens de aard van de uitvinding, een andere indeling of volgorde zou leiden tot een beter begrip en een grotere beknoptheid.  

c) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder paragraaf *b)* dient elk van de delen bedoeld onder paragraaf *d)* bij voorkeur te worden voorafgegaan door een passend opschrift zoals voorgesteld in de Administratieve Instructies.     
5.2.   *Openbaarmaking van een nucleotide- of aminozuur-sequentie*  

a. Wanneer de internationale aanvrage een openbaarmaking van een of meer nucleotide- of aminozuur-sequenties bevat, dient de beschrijving een sequentie-opsomming te bevatten die aan de in de Administratieve Instructies bedoelde norm voldoet en conform die norm wordt gepresenteerd als een apart onderdeel van de beschrijving.  

b. Wanneer het sequentie-opsommingsdeel van de beschrijving vrije tekst bevat als gedefinieerd in de in de Administratieve Instructies bedoelde norm, dient die vrije tekst ook te verschijnen in het hoofddeel van de beschrijving en in de taal daarvan.     

### Regel  6  

####De conclusies

6.1.   *Aantal en nummering van de conclusies*  

a) Het aantal conclusies dient redelijk te zijn, gezien de aard van de uitvinding, waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd.  

b) Indien er meer dan één conclusie is, dienen zij doorlopend te worden genummerd in Arabische cijfers.  

c) De wijze van nummering in geval van wijziging van de conclusies wordt geregeld in de Administratieve Instructies.     
6.2.   *Verwijzingen naar andere delen van de internationale aanvrage*  

a) Behalve wanneer dit absoluut noodzakelijk is, dienen de conclusies ten aanzien van de technische kenmerken van de uitvinding niet te steunen op verwijzingen naar de beschrijving of de tekeningen. In het bijzonder dienen zij niet te steunen op verwijzingen zoals: „zoals beschreven in deel.... van de beschrijving” of „zoals geïllustreerd in figuur .... van de tekeningen.”  

b) Wanneer de internationale aanvrage tekeningen bevat dienen de in de conclusies genoemde technische kenmerken bij voorkeur te worden gevolgd door de op deze kenmerken betrekking hebbende verwijzingstekens. Wanneer zij gebruikt worden dienen de verwijzingstekens bij voorkeur tussen haakjes te worden geplaatst. Indien de opneming van verwijzingstekens een sneller begrip van een conclusie niet speciaal vergemakkelijkt, dient zij achterwege te worden gelaten. Een aangewezen bureau kan de verwijzingstekens verwijderen ten behoeve van publikatie door dit bureau.     
6.3.   *Wijze van opstellen van de conclusies*  

a) De omschrijving van het onderwerp waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd, dient te worden gegeven aan de hand van de technische kenmerken van de uitvinding.  

b) Wanneer het ter zake dienende is moeten de conclusies bevatten: 

(i) een uiteenzetting van die technische kenmerken van de uitvinding die nodig zijn voor de omschrijving van het onderwerp waarop de conclusies betrekking hebben maar die, te zamen, behoren tot de bekende stand van de techniek,  

(ii) een beschrijving van de kenmerken - voorafgegaan door de woorden „daardoor gekenmerkt dat”, „gekenmerkt door”, „waarin de verbetering omvat” of andere woorden met dezelfde strekking - waarin de technische kenmerken beknopt worden uiteengezet waarvoor, te zamen met de kenmerken uiteengezet onder (i), bescherming wordt gewenst.    

c) Wanneer de nationale wetgeving van de aangewezen Staat de wijze van opstellen van de conclusies, bepaald onder paragraaf *b)*, niet vereist, heeft het niet volgen van die wijze van opstellen geen rechtsgevolgen in die Staat, mits de feitelijk gevolgde wijze van opstellen van de conclusies voldoet aan de nationale wetgeving van die Staat.     
6.4.   *Afhankelijke conclusies*  

a) Een conclusie die alle kenmerken van een of meer andere conclusies omvat (conclusie in afhankelijke vorm, hierna te noemen „afhankelijke conclusie”) dient zulks te doen door een verwijzing, indien mogelijk aan het begin, naar de andere conclusie of conclusies en vervolgens de bijkomende kenmerken te vermelden waarop de conclusie betrekking heeft. Afhankelijke conclusies die verwijzen naar meer dan één andere conclusie („meervoudig afhankelijke conclusies”), dienen alleen in de vorm van een alternatief naar zodanige conclusies te verwijzen. Meervoudig afhankelijke conclusies mogen geen grondslag vormen voor een andere meervoudig afhankelijke conclusie. Wanneer de nationale wetgeving van het nationale bureau dat optreedt als Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, niet toestaat dat meervoudig afhankelijke conclusies worden opgesteld op een wijze die afwijkt van hetgeen is aangegeven in de voorafgaande twee zinnen, kan het niet-volgen van die wijze van opstellen uitlopen op een vermelding ingevolge artikel 17, tweede lid, onder b), in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek. Het niet-volgen van genoemde wijze van opstellen heeft geen rechtsgevolgen in een aangewezen Staat indien de feitelijk gevolgde wijze van opstellen van de conclusies voldoet aan de nationale wetgeving van die Staat.  

b) Onder een afhankelijke conclusie dient te worden verstaan een conclusie die alle beperkingen omvat welke zijn neergelegd in de conclusie waarnaar zij verwijst of, indien de afhankelijke conclusie een meervoudig afhankelijke conclusie is, alle beperkingen, opgenomen in de conclusie in samenhang waarmee zij wordt beschouwd.  

c) Alle afhankelijke conclusies die terugverwijzen naar een enkele voorgaande conclusie en alle afhankelijke conclusies die terugverwijzen naar meer dan één voorgaande conclusie, dienen voor zover mogelijk en op de meest praktische wijze te worden ondergebracht in één groep.     
6.5.   *Gebruiksmodellen*  Een aangewezen Staat waar de verlening van een gebruiksmodel wordt gevraagd op basis van een internationale aanvrage kan, in plaats van de Regels 6.1 tot en met 6.4, ten aanzien van de in die Regels geregelde aangelegenheden, de bepalingen van zijn nationale wetgeving betreffende gebruiksmodellen toepassen, wanneer de behandeling van de internationale aanvrage in die Staat eenmaal is begonnen, met dien verstande dat de aanvrager ten minste 2 maanden na het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 van toepassing zijnde termijn zal worden toegestaan om zijn aanvrage aan te passen aan de vereisten van genoemde bepalingen in de nationale wetgeving.   

### Regel  7  

####De tekeningen

7.1.   *Vloeischema's en diagrammen*  Vloeischema's en diagrammen worden als tekeningen beschouwd.   
7.2.   *Termijnen*  De termijn genoemd in artikel 7, tweede lid, onder (ii), dient in de gegeven omstandigheden redelijk te zijn en in elk geval niet korter te zijn dan 2 maanden vanaf de datum van het schriftelijke verzoek waarbij de indiening van tekeningen of bijkomende tekeningen ingevolge genoemde bepaling wordt verlangd.   

### Regel  8  

####Het uittreksel

8.1.   *Inhouden vorm van het uittreksel*  

a) Het uittreksel dient te bestaan uit: 

(i) een samenvatting van de uiteenzetting zoals neergelegd in de beschrijving, de conclusies en mogelijke tekeningen; de samenvatting dient het technische gebied aan te geven waarop de uitvinding ligt en te worden opgesteld op een wijze die een duidelijk begrip van het technische probleem, de kern van de oplossing van dat probleem door de uitvinding en de voornaamste toepassing(en) van de uitvinding mogelijk maakt;  

(ii) wanneer van toepassing, de chemische formule die, van alle in de internationale aanvrage opgenomen formules, de uitvinding het beste kenmerkt.    

b) Het uittreksel dient zo beknopt te zijn als de uiteenzetting toelaat (bij voorkeur 50 tot 150 woorden, indien zij in het Engels is gesteld of vertaald).  

c) Het uittreksel dient geen verklaringen te bevatten over de beweerde verdiensten of de waarde van de uitvinding waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd of over de vermoedelijke toepassing.  

d) Elk technisch hoofdkenmerk vermeld in het uittreksel en geïllustreerd door een tekening in de internationale aanvrage dient te worden gevolgd door een tussen haakjes geplaatst verwijzingsteken.     
8.2.   *Figuur*  

a) Indien de aanvrager niet de opgave genoemd in Regel 3.3 a) (iii) verstrekt of indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek vaststelt dat (een) andere figu(u)r(en) dan door de aanvrager voorgesteld uit alle figuren van alle tekeningen de uitvinding beter zou(den) kenschetsen, dient zij, onverminderd het bepaalde onder paragraaf b), de figu(u)r(en) aan te geven die het uittreksel moet(en) vergezellen wanneer dit wordt gepubliceerd door het Internationale Bureau. In zo'n geval gaat het uittreksel vergezeld van de aldus door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek aangegeven figu(u)r(en). Anders gaat het uittreksel, onverminderd het bepaalde onder paragraaf b), vergezeld van de door de aanvrager voorgestelde figu(u)r(en).  

b) Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek bemerkt dat geen van de figuren van de tekeningen nuttig is voor het begrijpen van het uittreksel, stelt zij het Internationale Bureau daarvan in kennis. In zo'n geval gaat het uittreksel, wanneer het wordt gepubliceerd door het Internationale Bureau, niet vergezeld van enige figuur van de tekeningen, zelfs wanneer de aanvrager een voorstel heeft gedaan ingevolge Regel 3.3 a) (iii).     
8.3.   *Leidende beginselen bij de opstelling*  Het uittreksel dient zo te zijn opgesteld dat het doeltreffend kan dienen als een uitgangspunt voor een nauwkeurig nieuwheidsonderzoek op het bepaalde technische gebied, vooral door de wetenschapsman, ingenieur of onderzoeker te helpen bij het vormen van een oordeel over de vraag of het nodig is de internationale aanvrage zelf te raadplegen.   

### Regel  9  

####Uitdrukkingen, enz. die niet moeten worden gebruikt

9.1.   *Begripsomschrijving*  De internationale aanvrage dient niet te bevatten: 

(i) uitdrukkingen of tekeningen die in strijd zijn met de goede zeden;  

(ii) uitdrukkingen of tekeningen die in strijd zijn met de openbare orde;  

(iii) kleinerende opmerkingen over de produkten of werkwijzen van een bepaalde andere persoon dan de aanvrager of de verdiensten of geldigheid van aanvragen of octrooien van zodanige personen (het louter vergelijken met de bestaande techniek wordt op zichzelf niet als kleinerend beschouwd);  

(iv) een verklaring of andere inhoud die onder de omstandigheden kennelijk niet ter zake of onnodig is.     
9.2.   *Vaststelling van niet-naleving*  Het ontvangende bureau en de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek kunnen niet-naleving van de voorschriften van Regel 9.1 vaststellen en de aanvrager voorstellen dat hij zijn internationale aanvrage dienovereenkomstig vrijwillig verbetert. Indien de niet-naleving is vastgesteld door het ontvangende bureau, stelt dit de bevoegde Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek en het Internationale Bureau daarvan in kennis; indien de niet-naleving is vastgesteld door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek stelt deze het ontvangende bureau en het Internationale Bureau daarvan in kennis.   
9.3.   *Verwijzing naar artikel 21, zesde lid*  De „kleinerende opmerkingen” genoemd in artikel 21, zesde lid, hebben de betekenis zoals omschreven in Regel 9.1 (iii).

d) De gehele tekst dient te zijn weergegeven in letters waarvan de hoofdletters ten minste 0,28 cm hoog zijn en een donkere, onuitwisbare kleur hebben, voldoend aan de vereisten neergelegd in Regel 11.2, met dien verstande dat de tekst in het verzoekschrift mag zijn weergegeven in letters waarvan de hoofdletters ten minste 0,21 cm hoog zijn.  

e) Wat de regelafstand in getypte teksten en het formaat van de letters betreft, is het in de paragrafen c en d bepaalde niet van toepassing op teksten in het Chinees of het Japans.     
11.10.   *In de tekst opgenomen tekeningen, formules en tabellen*  

a) De aanvrage, de beschrijving, de conclusies en het uittreksel dienen geen tekeningen te bevatten.  

b) De beschrijving, de conclusies en het uittreksel kunnen chemische of wiskundige formules bevatten.  

c) De beschrijving en het uittreksel kunnen tabellen bevatten; een conclusie kan alleen tabellen bevatten indien het onderwerp van de conclusie het gebruik van tabellen wenselijk maakt.  

d) Tabellen en chemische of wiskundige formules kunnen overdwars op het blad worden geplaatst indien zij niet op bevredigende wijze rechtopstaand kunnen worden weergegeven; bladen waarop tabellen of chemische of wiskundige formules overdwars worden weergegeven, dienen zo te zijn ingedeeld, dat de bovenkant van de tabellen of formules zich aan de linkerzijde van het blad bevindt.     
11.11.   *Woorden in tekeningen*  

a) De tekeningen dienen geen tekst te bevatten, behalve een enkel woord of woorden, wanneer volstrekt onmisbaar, zoals „water”, „stoom”, „open”, „dicht”, „doorsnede over AB” en, in het geval van elektrische schakelingen en blokschema's of vloeischemadiagrammen, enkele korte trefwoorden die onmisbaar zijn voor het begrijpen van de tekening.  

b) De gebruikte woorden dienen zo te worden geplaatst, dat zij bij vertaling kunnen worden overgeplakt zonder de lijnen van de tekeningen te raken.     
11.12.   *Veranderingen, enz.*  Elk blad dient redelijk vrij te zijn van doorhalingen en vrij van veranderingen en boven elkaar geschreven en tussengeschreven woorden. Niet-naleving van deze Regel kan worden toegestaan, indien er geen sprake is van twijfel aan de rechtsgeldigheid van de inhoud en kan worden voldaan aan de vereisten voor goede reproduktie.   
11.13.   *Bijzondere vereisten voor tekeningen*  

a) Tekeningen dienen te worden uitgevoerd in duurzame, zwarte of blauwe, voldoende dichte en donkere, gelijkmatig en duidelijk aangegeven lijnen en streepjes zonder kleur.  

b) Doorsneden dienen te worden aangegeven door schuine arceringen die de duidelijke leesbaarheid van verwijzingstekens en hoofdlijnen niet mogen belemmeren.  

c) De schaal van de tekeningen en de duidelijkheid van de grafische uitvoering ervan dient zodanig te zijn, dat bij een fotografische reproduktie op twee/derde van de ware grootte alle details zonder moeite kunnen worden onderscheiden.  

d) Wanneer, in uitzonderlijke gevallen, op een tekening de schaal wordt gegeven, dient deze grafisch te zijn aangegeven.  

e) Alle cijfers, letters en verwijzingslijnen op de tekeningen moeten eenvoudig en duidelijk zijn. Haakjes, cirkels of aanhalingstekens mogen niet te zamen met cijfers en letters worden gebruikt.  

f) Alle lijnen in de tekeningen dienen gewoonlijk te worden getrokken met behulp van tekeninstrumenten.

h) De hoogte van de cijfers en letters mag niet kleiner zijn dan 0,32 cm. Voor de letters in tekeningen dient het Latijnse en, waar gebruikelijk, het Griekse alfabet te worden gebruikt.  

i) Hetzelfde blad tekeningen kan meer dan één figuur bevatten. Wanneer figuren op twee of meer bladen in feite één enkele volledige figuur vormen, dienen de figuren op de verschillende bladen zo te zijn geplaatst, dat de volledige figuur kan worden gevormd zonder dat een deel van de op de verschillende bladen voorkomende figuren wordt bedekt.  

j) De verschillende figuren dienen op een blad of bladen te worden geplaatst zonder ruimteverspilling, bij voorkeur rechtopstaand en duidelijk gescheiden. Wanneer de figuren niet rechtopstaand zijn geplaatst, dienen zij overdwars te worden weergegeven, met het bovenste deel van de figuren gericht naar de linkerzijde van het blad.  

k) De verschillende figuren dienen doorlopend te worden genummerd in Arabische cijfers, onafhankelijk van de nummering van de bladen.  

l) In de beschrijving niet vermelde verwijzingstekens mogen niet in de tekeningen voorkomen en omgekeerd.  

m) Dezelfde kenmerken dienen, wanneer zij worden aangegeven door verwijzingstekens, in de gehele internationale aanvrage door dezelfde tekens te worden aangegeven.  

n) Indien de tekeningen een groot aantal verwijzingstekens bevatten, wordt sterk aanbevolen er een afzonderlijk blad aan te hechten waarin alle verwijzingstekens en de kenmerken waarop zij betrekking hebben worden opgesomd.     
11.14.   *Latere documenten*  De Regels 10 en 11.1 tot en met 11.13 zijn ook van toepassing op documenten – bijvoorbeeld vervangende bladen, gewijzigde conclusies, vertalingen – die worden overgelegd na de indiening van de internationale aanvrage.

### Regel  12bis  

####Afschrift van uitkomsten van eerder nieuwheidsonderzoek en van eerdere aanvrage; vertaling

12bis.1.   *Afschrift van uitkomsten van eerder nieuwheidsonderzoek en van eerdere aanvrage; vertaling*  

a. Indien de aanvrager de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge Regel 4.12 heeft verzocht de uitkomsten van een eerder nieuwheidsonderzoek verricht door dezelfde of een andere Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek of door een nationaal bureau in aanmerking te nemen, overlegt de aanvrager, onverminderd de paragrafen c tot en met f, aan het ontvangende bureau, tezamen met de internationale aanvrage, een afschrift van de uitkomsten van het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek, ongeacht in welke vorm (bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van een verslag van het nieuwheidsonderzoek, een overzicht van de aangehaalde stand van de techniek of een verslag van de beoordeling) zij door de betreffende Instantie of het betreffende bureau worden gepresenteerd.  

b. De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek kan, onverminderd de paragrafen c tot en met f, de aanvrager uitnodigen binnen een gelet op de omstandigheden redelijke termijn het volgende in te dienen: 

i. een afschrift van de desbetreffende eerdere aanvrage;  

ii. indien de eerdere aanvrage is gesteld in een taal die niet wordt aanvaard door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, een vertaling van de eerdere aanvrage in een taal die door die Instantie wordt aanvaard;  

iii. indien de uitkomsten van het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek zijn gesteld in een taal die niet wordt aanvaard door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, een vertaling van die uitkomsten in een taal die door die Instantie wordt aanvaard;  

iv. een afschrift van elk document aangehaald in de uitkomsten van het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek.    

c. Indien het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek door hetzelfde bureau is verricht als het bureau dat optreedt als het ontvangende bureau, kan de aanvrager in plaats van de in de paragrafen a en b i en iv bedoelde afschriften te overleggen, de wens kenbaar maken dat het ontvangende bureau deze verzorgt en doet toekomen aan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek. Een dergelijk verzoek wordt gedaan in het verzoekschrift en het ontvangende bureau kan als voorwaarde stellen dat ten gunste van hem een taks wordt betaald.  

d. Indien het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek werd verricht door dezelfde Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek of hetzelfde bureau als de instantie die of het bureau dat optreedt als de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, behoeft geen afschrift of vertaling bedoeld in de paragrafen a en b uit hoofde van die paragrafen te worden overgelegd.  

e. Indien het verzoekschrift een verklaring ingevolge Regel 4.12 ii bevat met de strekking dat de internationale aanvrage gelijk is aan, of in hoofdzaak gelijk is aan, de aanvrage ter zake waarvan het eerdere nieuwheidsonderzoek is verricht, of dat de internationale aanvrage gelijk is aan, of in hoofdzaak gelijk is aan, die eerdere aanvrage, met dien verstande dat zij wordt ingediend in een andere taal, behoeft geen afschrift of vertaling bedoeld in de paragrafen b i en ii uit hoofde van die paragrafen te worden overgelegd.  

f. Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek beschikt over een afschrift of vertaling zoals bedoeld in de paragrafen a en b in een vorm en op een wijze die voor haar aanvaardbaar is, bijvoorbeeld uit een digitaal archief of in de vorm van het voorrangsbewijs, en de aanvrager dat aangeeft in het verzoekschrift, behoeft uit hoofde van die paragrafen geen afschrift of vertaling te worden overgelegd.     

### Regel  13  

####Eenheid van uitvinding

13.1.   *Vereiste*  De internationale aanvrage dient betrekking te hebben op slechts één uitvinding of op een groep van uitvindingen die zodanig onderling verbonden zijn dat zij op één enkele algemene uitvindersgedachte berusten („vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding”).   
13.2.   *Omstandigheden waarin wordt geacht te zijn voldaan aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding*  Wanneer in een en dezelfde internationale aanvrage de conclusies zijn gericht op een groep van uitvindingen, wordt slechts aan het in Regel 13.1 bedoelde vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding voldaan wanneer er een technisch verband bestaat tussen die uitvindingen bestaande uit één of meer dezelfde of overeenkomstige bijzondere technische kenmerken. Onder de term „bijzondere technische kenmerken” wordt verstaan de technische kenmerken die bepalend zijn voor een bijdrage die elk van de uitvindingen waarop de conclusies zijn gericht, als een geheel beschouwd, vormt ten opzichte van de stand van de techniek.   
13.3.   *Wijze van concluderen niet bepalend voor de eenheid van uitvinding*  Om te bepalen of een groep van uitvindingen zodanig onderling zijn verbonden dat zij op één enkele algemene uitvindingsgedachte berusten, doet het niet ter zake of de uitvindingen zijn vervat in afzonderlijke conclusies dan wel als varianten zijn opgenomen in één enkele conclusie.   
13.4.   *Afhankelijke conclusies*  Onverminderd Regel 13.1 is het toegestaan in dezelfde internationale aanvrage een redelijk aantal afhankelijke conclusies op te nemen, gericht op bijzondere vormen van de uitvinding waarop een onafhankelijke conclusie is gericht, zelfs wanneer de kenmerken van een afhankelijke conclusie op zich zelf als een uitvinding zouden kunnen worden beschouwd.   
13.5.   *Gebruiksmodellen*  Een aangewezen Staat waarin de verlening van een gebruiksmodel wordt verzocht op basis van een internationale aanvrage kan, in plaats van de Regels 13.1 tot en met 13.4, ten aanzien van de in deze Regels geregelde aangelegenheden de bepalingen van zijn nationale wetgeving betreffende gebruiksmodellen toepassen, wanneer de behandeling van de internationale aanvrage in die Staat eenmaal is begonnen, met dien verstande dat de aanvrager ten minste 2 maanden vanaf het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 van toepassing zijnde termijn wordt toegestaan om zijn aanvrage aan te passen aan de vereisten van genoemde bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving.   

### Regel  13bis  

####Uitvindingen met betrekking tot biologisch materiaal

13bis.1.   *Begripsomschrijving*  Voor de toepassing van deze regel wordt onder „verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal” verstaan de gegevens die in een internationale aanvrage worden verstrekt met betrekking tot het depot van biologisch materiaal bij een instituut voor bewaarneming of met betrekking tot het aldus gedeponeerde biologisch materiaal.   
13bis.2.   *Verwijzingen (algemeen)*  Elke verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal geschiedt overeenkomstig deze regel en indien aldus geschied, wordt zij beschouwd te voldoen aan de vereisten van de nationale wetgeving van elke aangewezen Staat.   
13bis.3.   *Verwijzingen: inhoud; nalaten een verwijzing of vermelding op te nemen*  

a) Een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal dient te vermelden: 

(i) de naam en het adres van het instituut voor bewaarneming waarbij het depot heeft plaatsgevonden;  

(ii) de datum van het depot van het biologisch materiaal bij dat instituut;  

(iii) het inschrijvingsnummer dat door dat instituut aan het depot is toegekend; en  

(iv) eventuele bijkomende gegevens die het Internationale Bureau ter kennis zijn gebracht ingevolge Regel 13bis.7 a)(i), mits het vereiste deze gegevens te vermelden ten minste twee maanden voor de indiening van de internationale aanvrage in het mededelingenblad is bekendgemaakt overeenkomstig Regel 13bis.7 c).    

b) Het nalaten een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal op te nemen of het nalaten in een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal een vermelding overeenkomstig paragraaf a op te nemen, heeft geen gevolgen in een aangewezen Staat waarvan de nationale wetgeving een zodanige verwijzing of vermelding in een nationale aanvrage niet vereist.     
13bis.4.   *Verwijzingen: Tijdslimiet voor de verstrekking van vermeldingen*  

a. Met inachtneming van paragraaf b en c, indien een of meer van de in Regel 13bis 3 a genoemde vermeldingen niet zijn opgenomen in een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal in de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend, maar zijn verstrekt aan het Internationaal Bureau: 

i. binnen 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang wordt deze vermelding door een aangewezen bureau beschouwd als op tijd verstrekt;  

ii. na het verstrijken van 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang wordt deze vermelding door een aangewezen bureau beschouwd als verstrekt op de laatste dag van die termijn indien het Internationaal Bureau deze vermelding ontvangt voordat de technische voorbereidingen voor internationale publicatie zijn afgerond.    

b. Indien de nationale wetgeving die van toepassing is op een aangewezen bureau dat voor nationale aanvragen vereist, kan dat bureau eisen dat de in Regel 13bis 3 a genoemde vermeldingen eerder worden verstrekt dan binnen 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang, onder de voorwaarde dat het Internationaal Bureau van dat vereiste in kennis is gesteld ingevolge Regel 13bis 7 a ii en dat vereiste tenminste twee maanden voor de indiening van de internationale aanvrage in overeenstemming met Regel 13bis 7 c heeft gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.  

c. Wanneer de aanvrager ingevolge artikel 21, tweede lid, onder b verzoekt om eerdere publicatie, kan een aangewezen bureau een vermelding die niet is verstrekt voordat de technische voorbereidingen voor internationale publicatie zijn afgerond beschouwen als niet op tijd verstrekt.  

d. Het Internationale Bureau stelt de aanvrager in kennis van de datum waarop het een krachtens paragraaf a verstrekte vermelding heeft ontvangen, en zal 

i. indien de vermelding voordat de technische voorbereidingen voor internationale publicatie zijn afgerond is ontvangen, de krachtens paragraaf a ontvangen vermelding publiceren alsmede de datum van ontvangst tezamen met de internationale aanvrage;  

ii. indien de vermelding werd ontvangen nadat de technische voorbereidingen voor internationale publicatie zijn afgerond, de aangewezen bureaus in kennis stellen van die datum en de relevante gegevens uit de vermelding.       
13bis.5.   *Verwijzingen en vermeldingen met het oog op een of meer aangewezen Staten; verschillende depots voor verschillende aangewezen Staten; depots bij andere instituten voor bewaarneming dan ter kennis zijn gebracht*  

a. Een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal wordt geacht te zijn gedaan met het oog op alle aangewezen Staten, tenzij zij uitdrukkelijk wordt gedaan met het oog op slechts bepaalde aangewezen Staten; hetzelfde geldt voor de in de verwijzing opgenomen vermeldingen.  

b. Voor verschillende aangewezen Staten kunnen verwijzingen naar verschillende depots van het biologisch materiaal worden gedaan.  

c. Een aangewezen bureau kan een depot verricht bij een ander instituut voor bewaarneming dan een dat ingevolge Regel 13bis 7 b ter kennis van het bureau is gebracht buiten beschouwing laten.     
13bis.6.   *Verstrekking van monsters*  

a)  Vervallen.   

b) Ingevolge de artikelen 23 en 40 vindt, behalve met machtiging van de aanvrager, geen verstrekking plaats van monsters van het gedeponeerde biologisch materiaal waarnaar in een internationale aanvrage wordt verwezen, vóór het verstrijken van de toepasselijke termijnen na welke ingevolge bedoelde artikelen een nationale behandeling kan aanvangen. Wanneer de aanvrager evenwel de handelingen verricht, bedoeld in de artikelen 22 of 39 na de internationale publicatie doch vóór het verstrijken van bedoelde termijnen, kan het verstrekken van monsters van het gedeponeerde biologisch materiaal plaatsvinden, zodra genoemde handelingen zijn verricht. Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepaling kan het verstrekken van monsters van het gedeponeerde biologisch materiaal plaatsvinden ingevolge de door een aangewezen bureau toe te passen nationale wetgeving zodra ingevolge die wetgeving de internationale publicatie de werking heeft van de verplichte nationale publicatie van een niet-beoordeelde nationale aanvrage.     
13bis.7.   *Nationale vereisten: Kennisgeving en publicatie*  

a) Een nationaal bureau kan het Internationaal Bureau in kennis stellen van een vereiste in de nationale wetgeving: 

i. dat in de kennisgeving genoemde gegevens, naast die bedoeld in Regel 13bis 3 a i, ii en iii, dienen te worden opgenomen in een verwijzing naar gedeponeerd biologisch materiaal in een nationale aanvrage;  

ii. dat een of meer van de vermeldingen, bedoeld in Regel 13bis 3 a dienen te worden opgenomen in een nationale aanvrage zoals ingediend of dienen te worden verstrekt op een in de kennisgeving genoemd tijdstip dat eerder valt dan 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang.    

b) Elk nationaal bureau stelt het Internationaal Bureau in kennis van de instituten voor bewaarneming bij wie de nationale wetgeving het verrichten van depots van biologisch materiaal ten behoeve van de octrooiprocedure voor dat bureau toestaat, of, indien de nationale wetgeving niet in zodanige depots voorziet of deze niet toestaat, van dat feit.  

c) Het Internationale Bureau maakt onverwijld in het mededelingenblad bekend de vereisten waarvan het in kennis is gesteld ingevolge paragraaf a) en informatie waarvan het in kennis is gesteld ingevolge paragraaf b).     

### Regel  13ter  

####Sequentie-opsommingen van nucleotiden en/of aminozuren

13ter.1.   *Procedure bij de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek*  

a. Wanneer de internationale aanvrage de openbaarmaking van een of meer nucleotide- en/of aminozuursequenties bevat, kan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek de aanvrager uitnodigen haar ten behoeve van het nieuwheidsonderzoek een sequentie-opsomming in elektronische vorm te verstrekken die voldoet aan de in de Administratieve Instructies bedoelde norm, tenzij zij reeds over een dergelijke opsomming in elektronische vorm kan beschikken in een vorm en op een wijze die voor haar aanvaardbaar is, en haar, indien van toepassing, binnen een in de uitnodiging vastgestelde termijn de in paragraaf c bedoelde taks wegens te late verstrekking te betalen.  

b. Wanneer ten minste een deel van de internationale aanvrage is ingediend op papier en de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek van oordeel is dat de beschrijving niet voldoet aan Regel 5.2 a, kan zij de aanvrager uitnodigen ten behoeve van het internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek, een sequentie-opsomming in papiervorm te verstrekken die voldoet aan de in de Administratieve Instructies bedoelde norm, tenzij zij reeds over een sequentie-opsomming in papiervorm kan beschikken in een vorm en op een wijze die voor haar aanvaardbaar is, ongeacht of de aanvrager uit hoofde van paragraaf a al dan niet is uitgenodigd een sequentie-opsomming in elektronische vorm te verstrekken en, indien van toepassing, binnen een in de uitnodiging vastgestelde termijn de in paragraaf c bedoelde taks wegens te late verstrekking te betalen.  

c. De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek kan de verstrekking van een sequentie-opsomming naar aanleiding van een uitnodiging uit hoofde van paragraaf a of b afhankelijk stellen van betaling ten gunste van de Instantie van een taks wegens te late verstrekking waarvan het bedrag wordt vastgesteld door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, hetgeen evenwel niet meer zal bedragen dan 25% van het in punt 1 van de Taksenschaal bedoelde bedrag van de internationale indieningstaks, waarbij de taks voor elk blad van de internationale aanvrage boven de 30 bladen buiten beschouwing blijft, mits een taks wegens te late verstrekking verlangd kan worden hetzij ingevolge paragraaf a, hetzij ingevolge paragraaf b, maar niet beide.  

d. Wanneer de aanvrager verzuimt binnen de in de uitnodiging overeenkomstig paragraaf a of b vastgestelde termijn de verlangde sequentie-opsomming te verstrekken en een eventueel verlangde taks wegens te late verstrekking te betalen, is de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek uitsluitend verplicht een nieuwheidsonderzoek te verrichten met betrekking tot de internationale aanvrage voor zover een zinvol onderzoek mogelijk is zonder de sequentie-opsomming.  

e. Een sequentie-opsomming die niet is opgenomen in de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend, ongeacht of deze is verstrekt naar aanleiding van een uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf a of b of anderszins, maakt geen deel uit van de internationale aanvrage, maar deze paragraaf belet de aanvrager niet de beschrijving met betrekking tot de sequentie-opsomming met inachtneming van artikel 34, tweede lid, onder b, te wijzigen.  

f. Wanneer de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek van oordeel is dat de beschrijving niet voldoet aan Regel 5.2 b, nodigt zij de aanvrager uit de vereiste verbetering in te dienen. Regel 26.4 is van overeenkomstige toepassing op een door de aanvrager aangeboden verbetering. De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek zendt de verbetering toe aan het ontvangende bureau en aan het Internationale Bureau.     
13ter.2.   *Procedure bij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling*  Regel 13 *ter* 1 is van overeenkomstige toepassing op de procedure bij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.   
13ter.3.   *Sequentie-opsomming voor het aangewezen bureau*  Een aangewezen bureau mag niet van de aanvrager verlangen hem een sequentie-opsomming te verstrekken anders dan een sequentie-opsomming die voldoet aan de in de Administratieve Instructies bedoelde norm.   

### Regel  14  

####De toezendingstaks

14.1.   *De toezendingstaks*  

a) Een ontvangend bureau kan verlangen, dat de aanvrager aan en ten behoeve van dat bureau een taks betaalt voor de inontvangstneming van de internationale aanvrage, de toezending van exemplaren aan het Internationale Bureau en de bevoegde Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek en het verrichten van alle andere taken die het, in zijn hoedanigheid van ontvangend bureau, moet verrichten in verband met de internationale aanvrage („toezendingstaks”).  

b) Het bedrag van de eventuele toezendingstaks wordt vastgesteld door het ontvangende bureau.  

c) De toezendingstaks dient binnen een maand na de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage te worden betaald. Het te betalen bedrag is het bedrag dat van toepassing is op die datum van ontvangst.     

### Regel  15  

####De internationale indieningstaks

15.1.   *De internationale indieningstaks*  Elke internationale aanvrage is onderworpen aan de betaling van een taks ten gunste van het Internationaal Bureau (“internationale indieningstaks”), te innen door het ontvangende bureau.   
15.2.   *Bedrag*  

a. Het bedrag van de internationale indieningstaks is vermeld in de Taksenschaal.  

b. De internationale indieningstaks dient te worden betaald in de valuta of een van de valuta’s die door het ontvangende bureau zijn voorgeschreven („voorgeschreven valuta”).  

c. Indien de Zwitserse frank de voorgeschreven valuta is, maakt het ontvangende bureau de bedoelde taks onverwijld in Zwitserse frank over naar het Internationale Bureau.  

d. Indien een andere dan de Zwitserse frank de voorgeschreven valuta is en die valuta: 

i. vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in Zwitserse frank, stelt de Directeur-Generaal voor elk ontvangend bureau dat een dergelijke valuta voorschrijft voor de betaling van de internationale indieningstaks een equivalent bedrag van die taks in de voorgeschreven valuta vast overeenkomstig de door de Algemene Vergadering gegeven richtlijnen en wordt het bedrag in die valuta onverwijld door het ontvangende bureau naar het Internationale Bureau overgemaakt;  

ii. niet vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in Zwitserse frank, is het ontvangende bureau verantwoordelijk voor het omwisselen van de internationale indieningstaks van de voorgeschreven valuta in Zwitserse frank en maakt het die taks in het bedrag als vermeld in de Taksenschaal in Zwitserse frank onverwijld over naar het Internationale Bureau.   Als alternatief kan het ontvangende bureau desgewenst de internationale indieningstaks van de voorgeschreven valuta omwisselen in euro of Amerikaanse dollar en het equivalente bedrag van die taks zoals vastgesteld door de Directeur-Generaal overeenkomstig door de Algemene Vergadering gegeven richtlijnen, als bedoeld onder i., onverwijld in euro of Amerikaanse dollar overmaken naar het Internationale Bureau.     
15.3.   *Termijn voor betaling; te betalen bedrag*  De internationale indieningstaks dient binnen een maand na de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage aan het ontvangende bureau te worden betaald. Het te betalen bedrag is het bedrag dat van toepassing is op die datum van ontvangst.   
15.4.   *Terugbetaling*  Het ontvangende bureau betaalt de internationale indieningstaks aan de aanvrager terug: 

i. indien de vaststelling ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid, negatief uitvalt,  

ii. indien de internationale aanvrage wordt ingetrokken of wordt geacht te zijn ingetrokken vóór de toezending van het oorspronkelijke exemplaar aan het Internationale Bureau, of  

iii. indien vanwege voorschriften met betrekking tot de nationale veiligheid de internationale aanvrage niet als zodanig wordt behandeld.     

### Regel  16  

####De taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek

16.1.   *Het recht een taks te vragen*  

a) Elke Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek kan verlangen, dat de aanvrager te haren gunste een taks („taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek”) betaalt voor het verrichten van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek en voor het vervullen van alle andere taken die door het Verdrag en dit Reglement aan Instanties voor Nieuwheidsonderzoek zijn opgedragen.  

b) De taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt geïnd door het ontvangende bureau. De bedoelde taks wordt betaald in de door dat bureau voorgeschreven valuta („voorgeschreven valuta”).  

c) Indien de voorgeschreven valuta de valuta is waarin de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek de bedoelde taks heeft vastgesteld („vastgestelde valuta”), maakt het ontvangende bureau bedoelde taks onverwijld in die valuta over naar die Instantie.  

d) Indien de voorgeschreven valuta niet de vastgestelde valuta is en die valuta: 

i. vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in de vastgestelde valuta, stelt de Directeur-Generaal voor elk ontvangend bureau dat een dergelijke valuta voorschrijft voor de betaling van de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek, een equivalent bedrag van die taks in de voorgeschreven valuta vast overeenkomstig de door de Algemene Vergadering gegeven richtlijnen en wordt het bedrag in die valuta onverwijld door het ontvangende bureau naar de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek overgemaakt;  

ii. niet vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in de vastgestelde valuta, is het ontvangende bureau verantwoordelijk voor het omwisselen van de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek van de voorgeschreven valuta in de vastgestelde valuta en maakt het die taks in het door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek vastgestelde bedrag in de vastgestelde valuta onverwijld over naar de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek.    

e) Indien ter zake van de betaling van de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek in een voorgeschreven valuta niet zijnde de vastgestelde valuta, het feitelijk door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge paragraaf d. i van deze Regel ontvangen bedrag in de voorgeschreven valuta bij de omwisseling ervan in de vastgestelde valuta lager is dan het door de Instantie vastgestelde bedrag, betaalt het Internationale Bureau het verschil aan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek; indien het feitelijk ontvangen bedrag hoger is, komt het verschil toe aan het Internationale Bureau.  

f) Met betrekking tot de termijn voor betaling van de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek en het te betalen bedrag zijn de bepalingen van Regel 15.3 inzake de internationale indieningstaks van overeenkomstige toepassing.     
16.2.   *Terugbetaling*  Het ontvangende bureau betaalt de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek aan de aanvrager terug: 

i. indien de vaststelling ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid, negatief uitvalt,  

ii. indien de internationale aanvrage wordt ingetrokken of wordt geacht te zijn ingetrokken vóór de toezending van het exemplaar voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek aan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, of  

iii. indien vanwege voorschriften met betrekking tot nationale veiligheid de internationale aanvrage niet als zodanig wordt behandeld.     
16.3.   *Gedeeltelijke terugbetaling*  Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge Regel 41.1 de uitkomsten van een eerder nieuwheidsonderzoek in aanmerking neemt bij het verrichten van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek, betaalt die Instantie de in verband met de internationale aanvrage betaalde taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek terug voor zover en onder de voorwaarden voorzien in de overeenkomst uit hoofde van artikel 16, derde lid, onder b.   

### Regel  16bis  

####Verlenging van de termijnen voor de betaling van taksen

16bis.1.   *Uitnodiging door het ontvangende bureau*  

a. Wanneer het ontvangende bureau op het tijdstip waarop taksen verschuldigd zijn ingevolge de Regels 14.1 c, 15.3 en 16.1 f, vaststelt dat geen enkele taks is betaald, of dat het betaalde bedrag niet voldoende is voor de toezendingstaks, de internationale indieningstaks en de taks voor het nieuwheidsonderzoek, nodigt het ontvangende bureau met inachtneming van paragraaf d de aanvrager uit het bedrag dat voor deze taksen nodig is alsnog te voldoen, indien van toepassing tezamen met de taks wegens te late betaling ingevolge Regel 16 *bis*.2, zulks binnen de termijn van een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging.  

b.  Vervallen.   

c. Wanneer het ontvangende bureau een uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf a tot de aanvrager heeft gericht, en de aanvrager niet binnen de in die paragraaf genoemde termijn het verschuldigde bedrag volledig heeft voldaan, indien van toepassing met inbegrip van de taks wegens te late betaling ingevolge Regel 16 *bis* 2, zal het ontvangende bureau, met inachtneming van paragraaf e: 

i. de verklaring daaromtrent ingevolge artikel 14, derde lid, opstellen en  

ii. handelen zoals voorzien in Regel 29.    

d. Een betaling die het ontvangende bureau ontvangt voordat het de uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf a. verzendt, wordt geacht te zijn ontvangen voor het verstrijken van de in Regel 14.1 c, 15.3 of 16.1 f genoemde termijn, naar gelang van het geval.  

e. Een betaling die het ontvangende bureau ontvangt voordat dat bureau de toepasselijke verklaring ingevolge artikel 14, derde lid, afgeeft, wordt geacht te zijn ontvangen voor het verstrijken van de in paragraaf a. genoemde termijn.     
16bis.2.   *Taks wegens te late betaling*  

a. De betaling van taksen naar aanleiding van een uitnodiging ingevolge Regel 16 *bis*. 1 a. kan door het ontvangende bureau worden onderworpen aan de betaling van een taks wegens te late betaling ten gunste van dat bureau. Deze taks bedraagt: 

i. 50% van het bedrag van de onbetaalde taksen dat in de uitnodiging is genoemd, of,  

ii. indien het ingevolge i. berekende bedrag lager is dan de toezendingstaks, een bedrag gelijk aan de toezendingstaks.    

b. Het bedrag van de taks wegens te late betaling mag evenwel niet hoger zijn dan 50% van de internationale indieningstaks bedoeld in punt 1 van de Taksenschaal, waarbij de taks voor elk blad boven de dertig bladzijden van de internationale aanvrage buiten beschouwing blijft.     

### Regel  17  

####Het voorrangsbewijs

17.1.   *Verplichting een afschrift van een eerdere nationale of internationale aanvrage over te leggen*  

a. Wanneer ingevolge artikel 8 de voorrang op grond van een eerdere nationale of internationale aanvrage wordt ingeroepen, dient een afschrift van die eerdere aanvrage, gewaarmerkt door de instantie waarbij zij was ingediend (“het voorrangsbewijs”), tenzij reeds bij het ontvangende bureau ingediend, tezamen met de internationale aanvrage waarin de voorrang wordt ingeroepen, en met inachtneming van de paragrafen b. en b- *bis*., uiterlijk 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang door de aanvrager aan het Internationaal Bureau of aan het ontvangende bureau te worden overgelegd, met dien verstande dat een afschrift van genoemde eerdere aanvrage dat het Internationaal Bureau ontvangt na het verstrijken van die termijn wordt geacht door dat bureau te zijn ontvangen op de laatste dag van die termijn indien het bureau het ontvangt vóór de datum van internationale publicatie van de internationale aanvrage.  

b. Wanneer het voorrangsbewijs door het ontvangende bureau wordt afgegeven, kan de aanvrager, in plaats van het voorrangsbewijs over te leggen, het ontvangende bureau verzoeken het voorrangsbewijs op te stellen en toe te zenden aan het Internationaal Bureau. Een dergelijk verzoek dient niet later te worden gedaan dan 16 maanden na de datum van voorrang en kan door het ontvangende bureau worden onderworpen aan de betaling van een taks.  

b-bis. Indien het Internationaal Bureau in overeenstemming met de Administratieve Instructies voor de datum van internationale publicatie van de internationale aanvrage via een digitale bibliotheek kan beschikken over het voorrangsbewijs, kan de aanvrager voor de datum van internationale publicatie van de internationale aanvrage in plaats van het voorrangsbewijs over te leggen het Internationaal Bureau verzoeken het voorrangsbewijs via deze digitale bibliotheek op te vragen.  

c. Indien aan geen van de vereisten van de drie voorgaande paragrafen is voldaan, kan een aangewezen bureau met inachtneming van paragraaf d, het beroep op het recht van voorrang buiten beschouwing laten, mits een aangewezen bureau het beroep op het recht van voorrang niet buiten beschouwing laat voordat de aanvrager in de gelegenheid is gesteld het voorrangsbewijs binnen een onder de omstandigheden redelijke termijn te verstrekken.  

d. Een aangewezen bureau mag een beroep op het recht van voorrang ingevolge paragraaf c. niet buiten beschouwing laten, indien de eerdere aanvrage bedoeld in paragraaf a. bij dat bureau in de hoedanigheid van nationaal bureau is ingediend of indien het, in overeenstemming met de Administratieve Instructies, via een digitale bibliotheek over het voorrangsbewijs kan beschikken.     
17.2.   *Beschikbaarheid van afschriften*  

a) Wanneer de aanvrager heeft voldaan aan Regel 17.1 a, b of b- *bis* verstrekt het Internationale Bureau, op het daartoe strekkende verzoek van het aangewezen bureau, onverwijld maar niet voor de internationale publicatie van de internationale aanvrage, een afschrift van het voorrangsbewijs aan dat bureau. Dat bureau mag de aanvrager niet zelf om een afschrift vragen. De aanvrager is niet verplicht vóór het verstrijken van de desbetreffende termijn krachtens artikel 22 een vertaling te verstrekken aan het aangewezen bureau. Indien de aanvrager voorafgaand aan de internationale publicatie van de internationale aanvrage een uitdrukkelijk verzoek krachtens artikel 23, tweede lid, doet aan het aangewezen bureau, verstrekt het Internationale Bureau na ontvangst van het daartoe strekkende verzoek van het aangewezen bureau onverwijld een afschrift van het voorrangsbewijs aan dat bureau.  

b) Het Internationale Bureau stelt geen afschriften van het voorrangsbewijs ter beschikking van het publiek voor de internationale publikatie van de internationale aanvrage.  

c) Wanneer de internationale aanvrage is gepubliceerd ingevolge artikel 21, verstrekt het Internationaal Bureau een ieder, op diens verzoek, een afschrift van het voorrangsbewijs tegen vergoeding van de kosten, tenzij, vóór die publicatie: 

i. de internationale aanvrage werd ingetrokken,  

ii. het desbetreffende beroep op een recht van voorrang werd ingetrokken of, ingevolge Regel 26bis 2 b, als niet gedaan werd beschouwd.       

### Regel  18  

####De aanvrager

18.1.   *Woonplaats en nationaliteit*  

a. Onverminderd het in de paragrafen b en c bepaalde, is de vraag of een aanvrager inwoner of onderdaan is van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij beweert inwoner of onderdaan te zijn, afhankelijk van de nationale wetgeving van die Staat en wordt hierover beslist door het ontvangende bureau.  

b. In elk geval, 

i. wordt het hebben van een daadwerkelijke en wezenlijke inrichting van nijverheid of handel in een Verdragsluitende Staat als bewijs van woonplaats in die Staat beschouwd, en  

ii. wordt een rechtspersoon, opgericht volgens de nationale wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat, als onderdaan van die Staat beschouwd.    

c. Wanneer de internationale aanvrage wordt ingediend bij het Internationale Bureau dat als ontvangend bureau fungeert, verzoekt het Internationale Bureau, in de in de Administratieve Instructies genoemde omstandigheden, het nationale bureau van, of dat optreedt voor, de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staat te beslissen over de in paragraaf a bedoelde vraag. Het Internationale Bureau stelt de aanvrager van een eventueel verzoek hiertoe in kennis. De aanvrager dient de mogelijkheid te hebben rechtstreeks aan het nationale bureau argumenten voor te leggen. Het nationale bureau beslist onverwijld over deze vraag.     
18.2.   Vervallen.    
18.3.   *Meer dan één aanvrager*  Indien er meer dan één aanvrager is, bestaat het recht tot het indienen van een internationale aanvrage indien ten minste één van hen ingevolge artikel 9 bevoegd is een internationale aanvrage in te dienen.   
18.4.   *Gegevens over voorwaarden met betrekking tot aanvragers op grond van nationale wetgeving*  

a) De internationale aanvrage kan verschillende aanvragers vermelden voor verschillende aangewezen Staten mits ten aanzien van elke aangewezen Staat ten minste één van de voor die Staat vermelde aanvragers ingevolge artikel 9 bevoegd is een internationale aanvrage in te dienen.  

b) Indien aan het vereiste van paragraaf *a)* niet is voldaan ten aanzien van een aangewezen Staat, wordt de aanwijzing van die Staat als niet gedaan beschouwd.  

c) Het internationale Bureau publiceert van tijd tot tijd gegevens over de verschillende nationale wetgevingen met betrekking tot de vraag wie bevoegd is (uitvinder, rechtsopvolger van de uitvinder, rechthebbende op de uitvinding of anderen) een nationale aanvrage in te dienen en voegt aan deze gegevens een waarschuwing toe dat de rechtsgevolgen van de internationale aanvrage in een aangewezen Staat kunnen afhangen van het feit of de in de internationale aanvrage voor die Staat als aanvrager vermelde persoon een persoon is die, ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van die Staat, bevoegd is een nationale aanvrage in te dienen.     

### Regel  19  

####Het bevoegde ontvangende bureau

19.1.   *Waar in te dienen*  

a) Behoudens het in paragraaf b bepaalde, wordt de internationale aanvrage, naar keuze van de aanvrager, ingediend, 

i. bij het nationale bureau van, of dat optreedt voor, de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de aanvrager inwoner is,  

ii. bij het nationale bureau van, of dat optreedt voor, de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de aanvrager onderdaan is, of  

iii. ongeacht de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de aanvrager inwoner of onderdaan is, bij het Internationale Bureau.    

b) Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan met een andere Verdragsluitende Staat of een intergouvernementele organisatie overeenkomen, dat het nationale bureau van laatstgenoemde Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie voor alle of enkele aangelegenheden in plaats van het nationale bureau van de eerstgenoemde Staat optreedt als ontvangend bureau voor aanvragers die inwoner of onderdaan van die eerstgenoemde Staat zijn. Niettegenstaande een zodanige overeenkomst wordt het nationale bureau van de eerstgenoemde Staat beschouwd als het bevoegde ontvangende bureau voor de toepassing van artikel 15, vijfde lid.  

c) In verband met besluiten genomen ingevolge artikel 9, tweede lid, wijst de Algemene Vergadering aan het nationale bureau dat, of de intergouvernementele organisatie die zal optreden als ontvangend bureau voor aanvragen van inwoners of onderdanen van door de Algemene Vergadering aangegeven Staten. Voor een zodanige aanwijzing is de voorafgaande toestemming van het genoemde nationaal bureau of de genoemde intergoevernementele organisatie vereist.     
19.2.   *Meer dan één aanvrager*  Indien er meer dan één aanvrager is: 

i. wordt aan de vereisten van Regel 19.1 geacht te zijn voldaan indien het nationale bureau waarbij de internationale aanvrage is ingediend, het nationale bureau is van, of dat optreedt voor, een Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan ten minste één van de aanvragers inwoner of onderdaan is;  

ii. kan de internationale aanvrage worden ingediend bij het Internationale Bureau ingevolge Regel 19.1 a iii, indien ten minste één van de aanvragers inwoner of onderdaan is van een Verdragsluitende Staat.     
19.3.   *Bekendmaking van delegatie van de taken van het ontvangende bureau*  

a) Van een overeenkomst zoals bedoeld in Regel 19.1 *b)* wordt door de Verdragsluitende Staat die de taken van het ontvangende bureau delegeert aan het nationale bureau van of optredend voor een andere Verdragsluitende Staat of een intergouvernementele organisatie, onverwijld kennis gegeven aan het Internationale Bureau.  

b) Het Internationale Bureau maakt de kennisgeving onverwijld na ontvangst bekend in het mededelingenblad.     
19.4.   *Toezending aan het Internationale Bureau als ontvangend bureau*  

a. Wanneer een internationale aanvrage wordt ingediend bij een nationaal bureau dat ingevolge het Verdrag optreedt als ontvangend bureau, maar 

i. dat nationale bureau ingevolge Regel 19.1 of 19.2 niet bevoegd is om die internationale aanvrage te ontvangen, of  

ii. die internationale aanvrage niet in een taal is gesteld die ingevolge Regel 12.1 a door dat nationale bureau wordt geaccepteerd, maar in een taal die ingevolge die Regel door het Internationaal Bureau als ontvangende bureau wordt geaccepteerd, of  

iii. dat nationale bureau en het Internationaal Bureau, om redenen anders dan die welke in i en ii zijn genoemd en met toestemming van de aanvrager, overeenkomen dat de procedure ingevolge deze Regel van toepassing is, dan wordt die internationale aanvrage, met inachtneming van paragraaf b, geacht te zijn ontvangen door dat bureau namens het Internationaal Bureau als ontvangend bureau ingevolge Regel 19.1 a iii.    

b. Wanneer ingevolge paragraaf a een internationale aanvrage door een nationaal bureau wordt ontvangen namens het Internationale Bureau dat fungeert als ontvangend bureau ingevolge Regel 19.1 a iii, zendt dat nationale bureau de internationale aanvrage onverwijld toe aan het Internationale Bureau, tenzij voorschriften inzake de nationale veiligheid zulks beletten. Deze toezending kan door het nationale bureau afhankelijk worden gesteld van de betaling van een taks, ten gunste van dat bureau, die gelijk is aan de toezendingstaks die dat bureau int ingevolge Regel 14. De aldus toegezonden internationale aanvrage wordt geacht te zijn ontvangen door het Internationale Bureau dat fungeert als ontvangend bureau ingevolge Regel 19.1 a iii, op de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage door dat nationale bureau.  

c. Voor de toepassing van de Regels 14.1 c, 15.3 en 16.1 f wordt, wanneer de internationale aanvrage ingevolge paragraaf b is verzonden aan het Internationale Bureau, de datum waarop de internationale aanvrage daadwerkelijk door het Internationale Bureau werd ontvangen beschouwd als de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage. Voor de toepassing van deze paragraaf is de laatste zin van paragraaf b niet van toepassing.     

### Regel  20  

####Datum van internationale indiening

20.1.   *Vaststelling ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid*  

a. Onverwijld na de ontvangst van de bescheiden die bedoeld zijn als een internationale aanvrage, stelt het ontvangende bureau vast of deze voldoen aan de vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid.  

b. Voor de toepassing van artikel 11, eerste lid, iii, onder c, kan volstaan worden met het vermelden van de naam van de aanvrager op een wijze die het mogelijk maakt de identiteit van de aanvrager vast te stellen, zelfs wanneer de naam verkeerd is gespeld, de voornamen niet volledig zijn vermeld, of, in het geval van rechtspersonen, de naamsaanduiding afgekort of onvolledig is.  

c. Voor de toepassing van artikel 11, eerste lid, onder ii, is het voldoende dat het deel dat een beschrijving lijkt te zijn (niet zijnde een sequentie-opsommingsdeel daarvan) en het deel dat een conclusie of conclusies lijkt te zijn, zijn gesteld in een door het ontvangende bureau ingevolge Regel 12.1 a geaccepteerde taal.  

d. Indien paragraaf c op 1 oktober 1997 niet verenigbaar is met de door het ontvangende bureau toegepaste nationale wetgeving, is paragraaf c niet van toepassing op dat ontvangende bureau zolang deze bepaling niet verenigbaar is met die wetgeving, mits genoemd bureau het Internationale Bureau hiervan in kennis stelt voor 31 december 1997. De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.     
20.2.   *Positieve vaststelling ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid*  

a. Indien het ontvangende bureau op het tijdstip van de ontvangst van de bescheiden die bedoeld zijn als een internationale aanvrage vaststelt dat aan de vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, is voldaan, kent het ontvangende bureau de datum van ontvangst van de internationale aanvrage toe als de datum van internationale indiening.  

b. Het ontvangende bureau stempelt het verzoekschrift van de internationale aanvrage waaraan het een datum van internationale indiening heeft toegekend zoals voorgeschreven in de Administratieve Instructies. Het aldus gestempelde exemplaar van het verzoekschrift is het oorspronkelijke exemplaar van de internationale aanvrage.  

c. Het ontvangende bureau stelt de aanvrager onverwijld in kennis van het nummer van de internationale aanvrage en datum van internationale indiening. Op hetzelfde tijdstip zendt het het Internationale Bureau een afschrift van de kennisgeving toe die aan de aanvrager is gezonden, tenzij het het oorspronkelijke exemplaar ingevolge Regel 22.1 a reeds aan het Internationale Bureau heeft gezonden of dat op hetzelfde tijdstip verzendt.     
20.3.   *Gebreken ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid*  

a. Indien bij het bepalen of de bescheiden die bedoeld zijn als een internationale aanvrage voldoen aan de vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, het ontvangende bureau vaststelt dat niet aan alle vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, is of lijkt te zijn voldaan, nodigt het de aanvrager uit om, naar keuze van de aanvrager: 

i. de benodigde verbetering ingevolge artikel 11, tweede lid, te verstrekken; of  

ii. indien de desbetreffende vereisten een element als bedoeld in artikel 11, eerste lid, iii, onder d of e, betreffen, in overeenstemming met Regel 20.6 a te bevestigen dat het element is opgenomen door middel van verwijzing ingevolge Regel 4.18; en eventueel bezwaar te maken binnen de van toepassing zijnde termijn ingevolge Regel 20.7. Indien deze termijn verstrijkt na afloop van 12 maanden na de datum van indiening van een aanvrage waarvoor een beroep op een recht van voorrang wordt gedaan, brengt het ontvangende bureau dit onder de aandacht van de aanvrager.    

b. Indien naar aanleiding van een uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf a of anderszins: 

i. de aanvrager het ontvangende bureau de vereiste verbetering verstrekt overeenkomstig artikel 11, tweede lid, na de datum van ontvangst van de beoogde internationale aanvrage maar op een latere datum binnen de van toepassing zijnde termijn overeenkomstig Regel 20.7, kent het ontvangende bureau die latere datum toe als de datum van internationale indiening en handelt het zoals voorzien in Regel 20.2, b en c;  

ii. een element bedoeld in artikel 11, eerste lid, iii, onder d of e, ingevolge Regel 20.6 b wordt beschouwd als zijnde vervat in de internationale aanvrage vanaf de datum waarop een of meer elementen als bedoeld in artikel 11, eerste lid, onder iii, voor het eerst werden ontvangen door het ontvangende bureau, kent het ontvangende bureau de datum waarop aan alle vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, is voldaan toe als datum van internationale indiening en handelt het zoals voorzien in Regel 20.2 b en c.    

c. Indien het ontvangende bureau later ontdekt of op grond van het antwoord van de aanvrager vaststelt dat het ten onrechte een uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf a heeft gedaan, aangezien voldaan was aan de vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, toen de bescheiden werden ontvangen, dient het te handelen zoals voorzien in Regel 20.2.     
20.4.   *Negatieve vaststelling ingevolge artikel 11, eerste lid*  Indien het ontvangende bureau niet binnen de van toepassing zijnde termijn ingevolge Regel 20.7, een verbetering of bevestiging heeft ontvangen zoals bedoeld in Regel 20.3 a of indien een verbetering of bevestiging ontvangen is, maar de aanvrage nog niet voldoet aan de vereisten van artikel 11, eerste lid, dient het ontvangende bureau: 

i. de aanvrager er onverwijld van in kennis te stellen dat de aanvrage niet wordt en niet zal worden behandeld als een internationale aanvrage en de redenen daarvoor te vermelden;  

ii. het Internationale Bureau ervan in kennis te stellen dat het nummer dat het op de bescheiden heeft aangetekend niet als een nummer van een internationale aanvrage zal worden gebruikt;  

iii. de bescheiden die de als internationaal bedoelde aanvrage vormen en daarop betrekking hebbende correspondentie te bewaren zoals voorzien in Regel 93.1; en  

iv. een afschrift van de genoemde bescheiden te zenden aan het Internationale Bureau, naar aanleiding van een verzoek door de aanvrager ingevolge artikel 25, eerste lid, wanneer het Internationale Bureau een dergelijk afschrift nodig heeft en daar speciaal om verzoekt.

d) Na het verstrijken van 14 maanden, te rekenen van de datum van voorrang, kan de aanvrager het ontvangende bureau verzoeken een afschrift van zijn internationale aanvrage te waarmerken als zijnde gelijkluidend aan de ingediende internationale aanvrage en kan hij een dergelijk gewaarmerkt afschrift toezenden aan het Internationale Bureau.  

e) Een waarmerking ingevolge paragraaf d) is kosteloos en kan slechts op een van de volgende gronden worden geweigerd: 

(i) het afschrift welke het ontvangende bureau is verzocht te waarmerken, is niet gelijkluidend aan de ingediende internationale aanvrage;  

(ii) voorschriften betreffende de nationale veiligheid beletten, dat de internationale aanvrage als zodanig wordt behandeld;

De verbetering van een beroep op een recht van voorrang kan het toevoegen van een in Regel 4.10 genoemde vermelding inhouden.  

b.

c. Wanneer de verbetering of aanvulling van een beroep op een recht van voorrang een wijziging in de datum van voorrang met zich meebrengt, wordt een termijn die wordt berekend vanaf de eerder geldende datum van voorrang en die nog niet is verstreken, berekend vanaf de gewijzigde datum van voorrang.     
26bis 2.   *Gebreken in beroepen op een recht van voorrang*  

a. Indien het ontvangende bureau, of het Internationale Bureau indien het ontvangende bureau dit nalaat, met betrekking tot een beroep op een recht van voorrang vaststelt dat: 

i. de internationale aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die na de datum valt waarop de termijn van voorrang verstreken is en dat geen verzoek om herstel van een recht van voorrang ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 is ingediend;  

ii. het beroep op een recht van voorrang niet voldoet aan de vereisten van Regel 4.10; of  

iii. een vermelding in het beroep op een recht van voorrang onverenigbaar is met de overeenkomstige vermelding in het voorrangsbewijs;   nodigt het ontvangende bureau of het Internationale Bureau, naargelang van het geval, de aanvrager uit het beroep op een recht van voorrang te verbeteren.

b. Indien de aanvrager voor het verstrijken van de termijn ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 1 a geen kennisgeving doet ter verbetering van het beroep op een recht van voorrang, wordt dat beroep op een recht van voorrang, met inachtneming van paragraaf c, ten behoeve van de procedure uit hoofde van het Verdrag aangemerkt als zijnde niet gedaan („aangemerkt als nietig”) en het ontvangende bureau of het Internationale Bureau, naargelang van het geval, verklaart aldus en stelt de aanvrager daarvan in kennis.

c. Een beroep op een recht van voorrang wordt niet aangemerkt als nietig uitsluitend omdat: 

i. een vermelding van het nummer van de eerdere aanvrage bedoeld in Regel 4.10 a ii ontbreekt;  

ii. een vermelding in het beroep op een recht van voorrang onverenigbaar is met de overeenkomstige vermelding in het voorrangsbewijs; of  

iii. de internationale aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die later valt dan de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang is verstreken, mits de datum van internationale indiening binnen de termijn van twee maanden na die datum valt.    

d. Indien het ontvangende bureau of het Internationale Bureau een verklaring heeft afgelegd ingevolge paragraaf b of indien het beroep op een recht van voorrang niet als nietig is aangemerkt uitsluitend omdat paragraaf c van toepassing is, publiceert het Internationale Bureau, tezamen met de internationale aanvrage, de informatie betreffende het beroep op een recht van voorrang als voorgeschreven door de Administratieve Instructies, alsmede informatie die de aanvrager heeft overgelegd met betrekking tot een dergelijk beroep op een recht van voorrang die het Internationale Bureau voorafgaand aan de voltooiing van de technische voorbereiding voor internationale publicatie heeft ontvangen. Deze informatie wordt overeenkomstig artikel 20 meegezonden wanneer de internationale aanvrage ingevolge artikel 64, derde lid, niet gepubliceerd wordt.  

e. Indien de aanvrager een beroep op een recht van voorrang wenst te verbeteren of toe te voegen, maar de termijn ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 1 verstreken is, kan de aanvrager voor het verstrijken van 30 maanden na de datum van voorrang en op voorwaarde van de betaling van een bijzondere taks waarvan het bedrag is vastgesteld in de Administratieve Instructies, het Internationale Bureau verzoeken informatie over de aangelegenheid te publiceren en het Internationale Bureau publiceert deze informatie onverwijld.

Indien de internationale aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die later valt dan de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang is verstreken, maar binnen een tijdvak van twee maanden na die datum, herstelt het ontvangende bureau op verzoek van de aanvrager en met inachtneming van de paragrafen b tot en met g van deze Regel, het recht van voorrang indien het bureau vaststelt dat aan een door hem gehanteerd criterium voor herstel is voldaan, namelijk dat het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen: 

i. was ontstaan ondanks het feit dat de in de gegeven omstandigheden nodige zorg was betracht; of  

ii. onopzettelijk was ontstaan.   Elk ontvangend bureau hanteert ten minste een van die criteria en kan ook beide hanteren.  

b. Een verzoekschrift op grond van paragraaf a: 

i. wordt binnen de ingevolge paragraaf e van toepassing zijnde termijn ingediend bij het ontvangende bureau;  

ii. bevat de redenen voor het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen; en  

iii. gaat bij voorkeur vergezeld van een verklaring of andere bewijzen die uit hoofde van paragraaf f vereist zijn.    

c. Indien een beroep op een recht van voorrang ter zake van de eerdere aanvrage niet in de internationale aanvrage opgenomen is, dient de aanvrager binnen de ingevolge paragraaf e van toepassing zijnde termijn een kennisgeving overeenkomstig Regel 26 *bis* 1 a in te dienen waarbij het beroep op een recht van voorrang wordt toegevoegd.  

d. Het ontvangende bureau kan voor de indiening van een verzoek om herstel uit hoofde van paragraaf a als voorwaarde stellen dat ten gunste van hem binnen de uit hoofde van paragraaf e van toepassing zijnde termijn een taks wordt betaald. Het bedrag van deze eventuele taks wordt vastgesteld door het ontvangende bureau. De termijn voor de betaling van de taks kan naar keuze van het ontvangende bureau worden verlengd tot een termijn van ten hoogste twee maanden na het verstrijken van de termijn die ingevolge paragraaf e van toepassing is.  

e. De in de paragrafen b onder i, c en d bedoelde termijn is twee maanden vanaf de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang is verstreken, met dien verstande dat, indien de aanvrager verzoekt om vroegtijdige publicatie ingevolge artikel 21, tweede lid, onder b, een verzoekschrift ingevolge paragraaf a, een kennisgeving zoals bedoeld in paragraaf c of een taks bedoeld in paragraaf d, ingediend of betaald nadat de technische voorbereidingen voor internationale publicatie zijn voltooid, niet geacht wordt tijdig te zijn ingediend of betaald.  

f. Het ontvangende bureau kan vereisen dat een verklaring of andere bewijzen ter staving van de redenen bedoeld in paragraaf b iii bij hem worden ingediend binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn. De aanvrager kan het Internationale Bureau een afschrift van een dergelijke verklaring of van andere bij het ontvangende bureau ingediende bewijzen verstrekken, in welk geval het Internationale Bureau het afschrift in zijn dossiers opneemt.  

g. Het ontvangende bureau wijst geen verzoek ingevolge paragraaf a geheel of gedeeltelijk af zonder de aanvrager in de gelegenheid te stellen binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn bezwaar te maken tegen de beoogde afwijzing. Het ontvangende bureau kan de aanvrager een dergelijke kennisgeving inzake de beoogde afwijzing toezenden tezamen met een uitnodiging om een verklaring of andere bewijzen ingevolge paragraaf f in te dienen.  

h. Onverwijld zal het ontvangende bureau: 

i. het Internationale Bureau in kennis stellen van de ontvangst van een verzoek ingevolge paragraaf a;  

ii. beslissen over het verzoek;  

iii. de aanvrager en het Internationale Bureau in kennis stellen van zijn beslissing en het criterium voor herstel waarop de beslissing gebaseerd was.    

i. Elk ontvangend bureau stelt het Internationale Bureau in kennis van welk van de criteria voor herstel het hanteert en van eventuele latere wijzigingen in dat opzicht. Het Internationale Bureau publiceert dergelijke informatie onverwijld in het mededelingenblad.  

j. Indien de paragrafen a tot en met i op 5 oktober 2005 niet verenigbaar zijn met de door het ontvangende bureau toegepaste nationale wetgeving, zijn die paragrafen niet van toepassing op dat bureau zolang zij niet verenigbaar zijn met die wetgeving, mits genoemd bureau het Internationale Bureau hiervan in kennis stelt voor 5 april 2006. De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.

a. De rechtsgevolgen van een internationale aanvrage waarvan de datum van internationale indiening valt in de in paragraaf b omschreven periode, kunnen worden uitgebreid tot een Staat („de opvolgerstaat”) waarvan het grondgebied vóór de onafhankelijkheid van die Staat deel uitmaakte van het grondgebied van een in de internationale aanvrage aangewezen Verdragsluitende Staat die vervolgens is opgehouden te bestaan (de „voorgangerstaat”), op voorwaarde dat de opvolgerstaat Verdragsluitende Staat is geworden door middel van de nederlegging bij de Directeur-Generaal van een verklaring van voortgezette gebondenheid, ertoe strekkende dat het Verdrag wordt toegepast door de opvolgerstaat.  

b. Het in paragraaf a bedoelde tijdvak begint op de dag volgend op de laatste dag van het bestaan van de voorgangerstaat en eindigt twee maanden na de datum waarop de in paragraaf a bedoelde verklaring door de Directeur-Generaal ter kennis is gebracht van de Regeringen van de Staten die partij zijn bij het [Verdrag van Parijs tot Bescherming van de Industriële Eigendom](../../../../../verdrag/verdrag/van/parijs/tot/bescherming/van/de/industriële/eigendom/van/20/etc/BWBV0004120/README.md). Wanneer de onafhankelijkheidsdatum van de opvolgerstaat echter eerder valt dan de datum van de dag volgend op de laatste dag van het bestaan van de voorgangerstaat, kan de opvolgerstaat verklaren dat bedoeld tijdvak begint op de datum van haar onafhankelijkheid; deze verklaring dient te worden afgegeven te zamen met de in paragraaf a bedoelde verklaring en de onafhankelijkheidsdatum dient daarin te zijn genoemd.  

c. Gegevens over internationale aanvragen waarvan de indieningsdatum valt binnen de ingevolge paragraaf b. van toepassing zijnde periode en waarvan de rechtsgevolgen worden uitgebreid tot de opvolgerstaat, worden door het Internationaal Bureau gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.

b. De opvolgerstaat kan een termijn vaststellen die later verstrijkt dan de in paragraaf a ii voorziene termijn. Het Internationaal Bureau publiceert de informatie inzake dergelijke termijnen in het mededelingenblad.     

### Regel  33  

####Stand van de techniek die voor het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek van belang is

33.1.   *Stand van de techniek die voor het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek van belang is*  

a) Voor de toepassing van artikel 15, tweede lid, bestaat de van belang zijnde stand van de techniek uit alles wat waar ook ter wereld ter beschikking van het publiek is gesteld door middel van schriftelijke publikatie (met inbegrip van tekeningen en andere illustraties) en dat van belang kan zijn bij de beslissing of de uitvinding waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd, al dan niet nieuw is en of zij al dan niet op uitvinderswerkzaamheid berust (d.w.z. al dan niet voor de hand ligt) mits het ter beschikking stellen aan het publiek heeft plaatsgevonden vóór de datum van de internationale indiening.  

b) Wanneer enige schriftelijke publikatie verwijst naar een mondelinge uiteenzetting, een gebruik, een tentoonstelling of een ander middel waardoor de inhoud van de schriftelijke publikatie ter beschikking van het publiek is gesteld en dit ter beschikking van het publiek stellen heeft plaatsgevonden op een datum voorafgaande aan de internationale indiening, dient het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek dit feit en de datum waarop het heeft plaatsgevonden afzonderlijk te vermelden indien de terbeschikkingstelling van de schriftelijke publikatie aan het publiek heeft plaatsgevonden op een datum die dezelfde is als, of later valt dan, de datum van de internationale indiening.  

c) Een bekendgemaakte aanvrage of een octrooi waarvan de datum van bekendmaking dezelfde is als, of later valt dan, maar waarvan de datum van indiening of, indien van toepassing, de datum van de voorrang waarop men zich beroept, voorafgaat aan de datum van internationale indiening van de aan een nieuwheidsonderzoek onderworpen internationale aanvrage, en die een voor de toepassing van artikel 15, tweede lid, van belang zijnde stand van de techniek zou vormen indien zij was gepubliceerd vóór de datum van internationale indiening, dient speciaal te worden vermeld in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek.     
33.2.   *Gebieden die het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek moet bestrijken*  

a) Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek bestrijkt al die technische gebieden en dient te worden verricht op de grondslag van al die systematische zoeksystemen die materiaal kunnen bevatten dat voor de uitvinding van belang is.  

b) Derhalve dient niet alleen de techniek waarbij de uitvinding kan worden ingedeeld te worden bezien, maar ook overeenkomstige technieken, ongeacht waarbij zij zijn ingedeeld.  

c) De vraag welke technieken in een bepaald geval als overeenkomstig moeten worden beschouwd, dient te worden bezien in het licht van wat de onontbeerlijk wezenlijke functie of het wezenlijke gebruik van de uitvinding lijkt te zijn en niet alleen de specifieke functies die uitdrukkelijk in de internationale aanvrage zijn vermeld.  

d) Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek dient alle onderwerpen te omvatten die algemeen worden erkend als gelijkwaardig te zijn aan het onderwerp van de uitvinding waarvoor bescherming wordt gevraagd, voor alle of bepaalde kenmerken daarvan, zelfs indien het onderwerp van de in de internationale aanvrage beschreven uitvinding in haar bijzonderheden daarvan verschilt.     
33.3.   *Gerichtheid van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek*  

a) Het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek dient te worden verricht op basis van de conclusies, met inachtneming van de beschrijving en de (eventuele) tekeningen en met bijzondere nadruk op de inventieve idee waarop de conclusies zijn gericht.  

b) Voor zover mogelijk en redelijk dient het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek het gehele onderwerp te bestrijken waarop de conclusies zijn gericht of waarop zij naar redelijke verwachting zullen zijn gericht, nadat zij zijn gewijzigd.     

### Regel  34  

####Minimumdocumentatie

34.1.   *Begripsomschrijving*  

a) De begripsomschrijvingen vervat in artikel 2, sub (i) en (ii), zijn voor deze Regel niet van toepassing.  

b) De documentatie bedoeld in artikel 15, vierde lid („minimumdocumentatie”) dient te bestaan uit: 

(i) de „nationale octrooibescheiden” zoals nader aangegeven in paragraaf *c)*,  

(ii) de gepubliceerde internationale (PCT) aanvragen, de gepubliceerde regionale aanvragen om octrooien en om uitvinderscertificaten en de gepubliceerde regionale octrooien en uitvinderscertificaten,  

(iii) ander niet tot de octrooilitteratuur behorend gepubliceerd materiaal waarover de Instanties voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek overeenstemming bereiken en dat door het Internationale Bureau dient te worden bekendgemaakt in een lijst wanneer die overeenstemming voor de eerste maal is bereikt en na elke wijziging.    

c) Onverminderd het bepaalde onder de paragrafen (d) en (e) zijn de “nationale octrooibescheiden” de volgende: 

(i) de octrooien verleend in en na 1920 door Frankrijk, het vroegere Reichspatentamt van Duitsland, Japan, de voormalige Sovjet-Unie, Zwitserland (alleen in de Franse en de Duitse taal), het Verenigd Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika,  

(ii) De octrooien verleend door de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, de Volksrepubliek China, de Republiek Korea en de Russische Federatie,  

(iii) de mogelijke octrooiaanvragen gepubliceerd in en na 1920 in de landen genoemd sub (i) en (ii),  

(iv) de door de voormalige Sovjet-Unie afgegeven uitvinderscertificaten,  

(v) de door Frankrijk afgegeven gebruikscertificaten en de in Frankrijk gepubliceerde aanvragen voor gebruikscertificaten,  

(vi) de octrooien die na 1920 zijn verleend door en de octrooiaanvragen die zijn gepubliceerd in enig ander land en zijn gesteld in de Engelse, de Franse of de Duitse taal en waarin geen voorrang wordt ingeroepen, met dien verstande dat het nationale bureau van het betrokken land deze documenten ordent en ter beschikking stelt van elke Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek.    

d) Wanneer een aanvrage eens of meer dan eens opnieuw wordt gepubliceerd (bijvoorbeeld een „Offenlegungsschrift” als „Auslegeschrift”), is een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek niet verplicht alle versies in haar documentatie te bewaren; elke Instantie is derhalve bevoegd niet meer dan één versie te bewaren. Wanneer bovendien een aanvrage is toegestaan en verleend in de vorm van een octrooi of een gebruikscertificaat (Frankrijk), is een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek niet verplicht zowel de aanvrage als het octrooi of het gebruikscertificaat (Frankrijk) in haar documentatie te bewaren; derhalve is elke zodanige Instantie bevoegd alleen de aanvrage dan wel het octrooi of het gebruikscertificaat (Frankrijk) te bewaren.  

e) Een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek waarvan de officiële taal of waarvan een van de officiële talen niet het Chinees, het Japans, het Koreaans, het Russisch of het Spaans is, is bevoegd in haar documentatie niet de octrooibescheiden van respectievelijk de Volksrepubliek China, Japan, de Republiek Korea, de Russische Federatie en de voormalige Sovjet-Unie alsmede de octrooibescheiden in de Spaanse taal, op te nemen, waarvan geen uittreksels in de Engelse taal algemeen beschikbaar zijn. Met betrekking tot Engelse uittreksels die algemeen beschikbaar komen na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Reglement is de opneming van de octrooibescheiden waarop de uittreksels betrekking hebben vereist uiterlijk zes maanden nadat deze uittreksels algemeen beschikbaar zijn geworden. In het geval van een onderbreking van het maken van uittreksels in het Engels op technische gebieden waar de Engelse uittreksels voordien algemeen beschikbaar waren, neemt de Algemene Vergadering passende maatregelen om te voorzien in het onverwijlde herstel van deze diensten op de genoemde gebieden.  

f) Voor de toepassing van deze Regel worden aanvragen die alleen ter inzage van het publiek zijn gelegd, niet als gepubliceerde aanvragen beschouwd.

####Gebrek aan eenheid van uitvinding (internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek)

40.1.   *Uitnodiging tot betaling van bijkomende taksen; termijn*  In de uitnodiging om bijkomende taksen te betalen zoals voorzien in artikel 17, derde lid, onder a, dient 

i. aangegeven te worden op welke gronden de internationale aanvrage geacht wordt niet te voldoen aan de vereiste eenheid van uitvinding;  

ii. de aanvrager uitgenodigd te worden de bijkomende taksen te voldoen binnen een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging, en dient het te betalen bedrag van die taksen vermeld te worden; en  

iii. de aanvrager, indien van toepassing, te worden uitgenodigd binnen een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging de in Regel 40.2 e bedoelde protesttaks te betalen en dient het te betalen bedrag te worden vermeld.     
40.2.   *Bijkomende taksen*  

a. Het bedrag voor de bijkomende taksen verschuldigd voor een nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge artikel 17, derde lid, onder a, wordt bepaald door de bevoegde Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

b. De ingevolge artikel 17, derde lid, onder a, verschuldigde bijkomende taksen dienen rechtstreeks te worden betaald aan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

c. Een aanvrager kan de bijkomende taksen onder protest betalen, dat wil zeggen, vergezeld van een met redenen omklede uiteenzetting dat de internationale aanvrage voldoet aan de vereiste eenheid van uitvinding of dat het bedrag van de vereiste bijkomende taksen buitensporig hoog is. Een zodanig protest dient te worden onderzocht door een in het kader van de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek ingesteld toetsingsorgaan, dat, voor zover het het protest gerechtvaardigd acht, beveelt dat de bijkomende taksen geheel of gedeeltelijk aan de aanvrager dienen te worden terugbetaald. Op verzoek van de aanvrager worden de tekst van het protest en van de beslissing dienaangaande tezamen met het verslag omtrent het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek ter kennis van de aangewezen bureaus gebracht. De aanvrager dient een vertaling daarvan over te leggen tezamen met de vertaling van de internationale aanvrage, vereist ingevolge artikel 22.  

d. In het in paragraaf c bedoelde toetsingsorgaan kan de persoon zitting hebben die de beslissing nam waarop het protest betrekking heeft, met dien verstande dat deze niet het enige lid van het orgaan mag zijn.  

e. De Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek kan het onderzoek naar aanleiding van een protest zoals bedoeld in paragraaf c afhankelijk stellen van de betaling ten gunste van de Instantie van een protesttaks. Indien de aanvrager verzuimt binnen de termijn ingevolge Regel 40.1 iii de vereiste protesttaks te betalen, wordt het protest geacht niet te zijn aangetekend en de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek zal dienaangaande een verklaring doen uitgaan. De protesttaks wordt aan de aanvrager terugbetaald indien het in paragraaf c bedoelde toetsingsorgaan van oordeel is dat het protest volledig gerechtvaardigd was.

Het Internationale Bureau zendt binnen twee maanden na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek om een vertaling een afschrift van de vertaling toe aan die Instantie en zendt tegelijkertijd een afschrift toe aan de aanvrager.     
45bis.5.   *Aanvang, grondslag en reikwijdte van aanvullend internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek*  

a. De voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie vangt onverwijld na de ontvangst van de in Regel 45 *bis*.4 e i tot en met iv omschreven documenten aan met het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek, met dien verstande dat de Instantie kan besluiten de aanvang van het onderzoek uit te stellen totdat zij tevens de documenten omschreven in Regel 45 *bis*.4 *e* v heeft ontvangen of totdat 22 maanden na de datum van voorrang zijn verstreken, al naargelang van hetgeen zich het eerst voordoet.  

b. Het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek wordt verricht op basis van de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend of van een vertaling bedoeld in Regel 45 *bis*.1 b iii of 45 *bis*.1 c i, waarbij het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek en het ingevolge Regel 43 *bis*.1 opgestelde schriftelijke oordeel naar behoren in aanmerking worden genomen indien de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie erover beschikt voordat zij aanvangt met het onderzoek. Indien het verzoek om aanvullend nieuwheidsonderzoek een vermelding overeenkomstig Regel 45 *bis*.1 d bevat, kan het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek worden beperkt tot de door de aanvrager ingevolge Regel 45 *bis*.1 d omschreven uitvinding en die onderdelen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op die uitvinding.  

c. Ten behoeve van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek zijn artikel 17, tweede lid, en de Regels 13 *ter*.1, 33 en 39 van dienovereenkomstige toepassing.  

d. Indien de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie beschikt over het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek voordat zij aanvangt met het nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge paragraaf a, kan zij conclusies waarop het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek geen betrekking had uitsluiten van het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

e. Indien de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek de verklaring bedoeld in artikel 17, tweede lid, onder a, heeft afgelegd en de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie over die verklaring beschikt voordat zij met het nieuwheidsonderzoek ingevolge paragraaf a aanvangt, kan die Instantie besluiten geen verslag van het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek op te stellen, in welk geval zij een dienovereenkomstige verklaring aflegt en de aanvrager en het Internationale Bureau daarvan onverwijld in kennis stelt.  

f. Het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek bestrijkt ten minste de daartoe in de ingevolge artikel 16, derde lid, onder b, van toepassing zijnde overeenkomst vermelde documentatie.  

g. Indien de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie van oordeel is dat het verrichten van het nieuwheidsonderzoek volledig uitgesloten is op grond van een beperking of voorwaarde bedoeld in Regel 45 *bis*.9 a, anders dan op grond van een beperking ingevolge artikel 17, tweede lid, zoals van toepassing uit hoofde van Regel 45 *bis*.5 c, wordt het verzoek om aanvullend nieuwheidsonderzoek geacht niet te zijn gedaan, in welk geval de Instantie een dienovereenkomstige verklaring aflegt en de aanvrager en het Internationale Bureau daarvan onverwijld in kennis stelt.  

h. De voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie kan in overeenstemming met een beperking of voorwaarde bedoeld in Regel 45 *bis*.9 a besluiten het onderzoek te beperken tot bepaalde conclusies, hetgeen het verslag van aanvullend internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek in dat geval vermeldt.     
45bis.6.   *Eenheid van uitvinding*  

a. Indien de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie van oordeel is dat de internationale aanvrage niet voldoet aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding: 

i. stelt zij het verslag van het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek op met betrekking tot de onderdelen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op de uitvinding die het eerst genoemd wordt in de conclusies („hoofduitvinding”);  

ii. stelt zij de aanvrager in kennis van haar oordeel dat de internationale aanvrage niet voldoet aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding, onder vermelding van de redenen voor dat oordeel; en  

iii. stelt zij de aanvrager in kennis van de mogelijkheid binnen de in paragraaf c bedoelde termijn te verzoeken om herziening van het oordeel.    

b. Bij de beoordeling of de internationale aanvrage voldoet aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding geeft de Instantie zich naar behoren rekenschap van elk document dat zij heeft ontvangen ingevolge Regel 45 *bis*.4 e vi en vii voordat zij aanvangt met het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

c. De aanvrager kan de Instantie binnen een maand na de datum van de kennisgeving ingevolge paragraaf a ii verzoeken het oordeel bedoeld in paragraaf a te herzien. De Instantie kan het verzoek om herziening onderwerpen aan de betaling ten gunste van haar van een herzieningstaks waarvan het bedrag door haar wordt vastgesteld.  

d. Indien de aanvrager binnen de termijn ingevolge paragraaf c verzoekt om herziening van het oordeel door de Instantie en de vereiste herzieningstaks betaalt, wordt het oordeel door de Instantie heroverwogen. De heroverweging mag niet uitsluitend geschieden door de persoon die de beslissing nam die aan een heroverweging onderworpen wordt. Indien de Instantie: 

i. vaststelt dat het oordeel volledig gegrond is, stelt zij de aanvrager dienovereenkomstig in kennis;  

ii. vaststelt dat het oordeel gedeeltelijk ongegrond is, maar nog altijd van mening is dat de internationale aanvrage niet voldoet aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding, stelt zij de aanvrager dienovereenkomstig in kennis, en handelt waar nodig zoals voorzien in paragraaf a i;  

iii. vaststelt dat het oordeel volledig ongegrond is, stelt zij de aanvrager dienovereenkomstig in kennis, stelt zij het verslag van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek op over alle onderdelen van de internationale aanvrage en betaalt zij de herzieningstaks terug aan de aanvrager.    

e. Op verzoek van de aanvrager worden de tekst van het verzoek om herziening en van de beslissing dienaangaande tezamen met het verslag van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek ter kennis van de aangewezen bureaus gebracht. De aanvrager dient een vertaling daarvan over te leggen tezamen met de vertaling van de internationale aanvrage vereist ingevolge artikel 22.  

f. De paragrafen a tot en met e zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing indien de voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie besluit het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek te beperken in overeenstemming met Regel 45 *bis*.5 b, tweede volzin, of Regel 45 *bis*.5 h, op voorwaarde dat elke verwijzing in deze paragrafen naar de „internationale aanvrage” dient te worden uitgelegd als een verwijzing naar die onderdelen van de internationale aanvrage die betrekking hebben op de door de aanvrager ingevolge Regel 45 *bis*.1 d omschreven uitvinding of die betrekking hebben op de conclusies respectievelijk die onderdelen van de internationale aanvrage waarvoor de Instantie een aanvullend nieuwheidsonderzoek zal verrichten.     
45bis.7.   *Verslag van aanvullend internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek*  

a. De voor het aanvullende nieuwheidsonderzoek aangezochte Instantie stelt binnen 28 maanden na de datum van voorrang het verslag van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek op of geeft de verklaring af bedoeld in artikel 17, tweede lid, onder a, zoals van toepassing uit hoofde van Regel 45 *bis*.5 c dat geen verslag van aanvullend internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek zal worden opgesteld.

Regel 43.9 is van overeenkomstig toepassing, met dien verstande dat de verwijzingen daarin naar de Regels 43.3, 43.7 en 44.2 dienen te worden genegeerd. Artikel 20, derde lid, en Regel 44.3 zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

d. Het verslag van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek behoeft geen aanhaling van een in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek aangehaald document te bevatten, tenzij het document dient te worden aangehaald in verband met andere documenten die niet in het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek zijn aangehaald.  

e. Het verslag van het aanvullende internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek kan toelichtingen bevatten:

a) Een Verdragsluitende Staat die verlangt dat ingevolge artikel 22 een vertaling wordt verstrekt of een nationale taks wordt betaald, of beide, geeft het Internationale Bureau kennis van: 

(i) de talen waaruit en de taal waarin hij vertaling verlangt,  

(ii) het bedrag van de nationale taks.    

a-bis) Een Verdragsluitende Staat die niet verlangt dat ingevolge artikel 22 door de aanvrager een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage wordt verstrekt (zelfs indien de toezending van het afschrift van de internationale aanvrage door het Internationale Bureau ingevolge Regel 47 niet heeft plaatsgevonden voor het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 van toepassing zijnde termijn) stelt het Internationale Bureau daarvan in kennis.  

a-ter) Een Verdragsluitende Staat die, indien hij een aangewezen Staat is, ingevolge artikel 24, tweede lid, de rechtsgevolgen bepaald in artikel 11, derde lid, handhaaft, zelfs indien een afschrift van de internationale aanvrage niet is verstrekt door de aanvrager voor het verstrijken van de ingevolge artikel 22 van toepassing zijnde termijn, stelt het Internationale Bureau daarvan in kennis.  

b) Een kennisgeving ontvangen door het Internationale Bureau ingevolge het bepaalde onder de paragrafen a), a-bis) of a-ter) wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld bekendgemaakt in het mededelingenblad.  

c) Indien de onder paragraaf *a)* gestelde vereisten later veranderen, dienen deze veranderingen door de Verdragsluitende Staat ter kennis te worden gebracht van het Internationale Bureau en dit Bureau maakt de kennisgeving onverwijld bekend in het mededelingenblad. Indien de verandering inhoudt dat vertaling is vereist in een taal die vóór de verandering niet was vereist, geldt deze verandering slechts ten aanzien van internationale aanvragen die meer dan 2 maanden na de bekendmaking van de kennisgeving in het mededelingenblad worden ingediend. In de andere gevallen wordt de datum waarop een verandering ingaat, bepaald door de Verdragsluitende Staat.     
49.2.   *Talen*  De taal waarin een vertaling kan worden verlangd, moet een officiële taal van het aangewezen bureau zijn. Indien er meer dan één officiële taal is, kan geen vertaling worden geëist, indien de internationale aanvrage in een van deze talen is gesteld. Indien er meer dan één officiële taal is en een vertaling moet worden verstrekt, kan de aanvrager een van deze talen kiezen. Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van deze paragraaf kan, indien er meer dan één officiële taal is, maar de nationale wetgeving het gebruik van een dezer talen voorschrijft voor vreemdelingen, een vertaling in die taal worden geëist.   
49.3.   *Verklaringen ingevolge artikel 19; vermeldingen ingevolge Regel 13bis.4*  Voor de toepassing van artikel 22 en van de onderhavige Regel worden een ingevolge artikel 19, eerste lid, afgelegde verklaring en een vermelding verstrekt ingevolge Regel 13bis.4, onverminderd het bepaalde in Regel 49.5 c) en h), als een deel van de internationale aanvrage beschouwd.   
49.4.   *Gebruik van een nationaal formulier*  Geen aanvrager behoeft een nationaal formulier te gebruiken voor het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen.   
49.5.   *Inhoud van en vormvoorschriften voor de vertaling*  

a) Voor de toepassing van artikel 22 dient de vertaling van de internationale aanvrage de beschrijving (onverminderd paragraaf a- *bis*)), de conclusies, de tekst bij de tekeningen en het uittreksel te bevatten. Indien het aangewezen bureau daarom verzoekt, dient de vertaling, onverminderd het bepaalde in de paragrafen (b), (c- *bis*) en (e), tevens 

(i) het verzoekschrift te bevatten,  

(ii) indien de conclusies ingevolge artikel 19 zijn gewijzigd, zowel de ingediende conclusies als de gewijzigde conclusies te bevatten (de gewijzigde conclusies dienen te worden verstrekt in de vorm van een vertaling van de complete reeks conclusies verstrekt ingevolge Regel 46.5 (a) ter vervanging van alle oorspronkelijk ingediende conclusies), en  

(iii) vergezeld te gaan van een afschrift van de tekeningen.    

a-bis) Een aangewezen bureau mag de aanvrager niet vragen om een vertaling van tekst in het sequentie-opsommingsdeel van de beschrijving indien dit sequentie-opsommingsdeel voldoet aan Regel 12.1 d en indien de beschrijving voldoet aan Regel 5.2 b.  

b) Een aangewezen bureau dat het verstrekken van een vertaling van het verzoekschrift verlangt, dient afschriften van het formulier van het verzoekschrift in de taal van de vertaling kosteloos aan de aanvragers te verschaffen. Vorm en inhoud van het formulier van het verzoekschrift in de taal van de vertaling dienen niet af te wijken van die van het verzoekschrift ingevolge de Regels 3 en 4; het formulier in de taal van de vertaling dient in het bijzonder geen gegevens te vragen die niet in het oorspronkelijke verzoekschrift zijn opgenomen. Het gebruik van het formulier van het verzoekschrift in de taal van de vertaling dient vrij te zijn.  

c) Wanneer de aanvrager geen vertaling verstrekt van een ingevolge artikel 19, eerste lid, afgelegde verklaring, kan het aangewezen bureau een dergelijke verklaring buiten beschouwing laten.  

c-bis) Wanneer de aanvrager aan een aangewezen bureau dat ingevolge paragraaf a ii een vertaling verlangt van zowel de conclusies zoals ingediend als de conclusies zoals gewijzigd, slechts één van de twee verlangde vertalingen verstrekt, kan het aangewezen bureau de conclusies waarvan geen vertaling is verstrekt buiten beschouwing laten of de aanvrager uitnodigen de ontbrekende vertaling te verstrekken binnen een termijn die gezien de omstandigheden redelijk is en in de uitnodiging is vastgesteld. Wanneer het aangewezen bureau verkiest de aanvrager uit te nodigen de ontbrekende vertaling te verstrekken en deze niet is verstrekt binnen de in de uitnodiging vastgestelde termijn, kan het aangewezen bureau de conclusies waarvan geen vertaling is verstrekt buiten beschouwing laten of de internationale aanvrage als ingetrokken beschouwen.  

d) Indien een tekening tekst bevat, dient de vertaling van die tekst verstrekt te worden, hetzij in de vorm van een afschrift van de oorspronkelijke tekening met de vertaling geplakt op de originele tekst, hetzij in de vorm van een opnieuw uitgevoerde tekening.  

e) Een aangewezen bureau dat ingevolge paragraaf a het verstrekken van een afschrift van de tekeningen verlangt, dient, wanneer de aanvrager niet binnen de termijn bepaald in artikel 22 dit afschrift heeft verstrekt, de aanvrager uit te nodigen dit afschrift te verstrekken binnen een termijn die gezien de omstandigheden redelijk is en in de uitnodiging is vastgesteld.  

f) De uitdrukking „Fig.” behoeft in geen enkele taal vertaald te worden.  

g) Wanneer een afschrift van de tekeningen of een opnieuw uitgevoerde tekening die is verstrekt ingevolge paragraaf d) of e), onverenigbaar is met de in Regel 11 genoemde vormvoorschriften, kan het aangewezen bureau de aanvrager verzoeken het gebrek binnen een termijn die naar de omstandigheden redelijk is en opgenomen is in het verzoek, te verbeteren.  

h) Wanneer de aanvrager geen vertaling heeft verstrekt van het uittreksel of een ingevolge Regel 13 *bis*.4 verstrekte vermelding, nodigt het aangewezen bureau de aanvrager uit de vertaling alsnog te verstrekken, indien het zulks noodzakelijk acht, binnen een termijn die gezien de omstandigheden redelijk is en in de uitnodiging is vastgesteld.  

i) Gegevens inzake een vereiste en de handelwijze van aangewezen bureaus, met betrekking tot de tweede zin van paragraaf a), worden door het Internationale Bureau in het mededelingenblad bekendgemaakt.  

j) Een aangewezen bureau mag niet verlangen dat de vertaling van de internationale aanvrage voldoet aan andere vormvoorschriften dan die welke voorgeschreven zijn voor de oorspronkelijke internationale aanvrage.  

k) Wanneer een titel door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek is vastgesteld ingevolge Regel 37.2, dient de vertaling de titel te bevatten zoals vastgesteld door die Instantie.  

l) Indien paragraaf c *-bis* of paragraaf k op 12 juli 1991 niet verenigbaar is met de door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale wetgeving, is de desbetreffende bepaling niet van toepassing op dat aangewezen bureau zolang deze niet verenigbaar is met die wetgeving, mits genoemd bureau het Internationale Bureau hiervan in kennis stelt voor 31 december 1991. De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.     
49.6.   *Herstel van rechten indien verzuimd is de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen te verrichten*  

a. Indien de rechtsgevolgen van de internationale aanvrage voorzien in artikel 11, derde lid, zijn vervallen, omdat de aanvrager verzuimd heeft binnen de desbetreffende termijn de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen te verrichten, herstelt het aangewezen bureau de aanvrager op diens verzoek en met inachtneming van het gestelde in de paragrafen b tot en met e van deze regel, in zijn rechten met betrekking tot die internationale aanvrage, indien het oordeelt dat de vertraging bij de inachtneming van die termijn onopzettelijk is ontstaan, of, naar keuze van het aangewezen bureau, dat die termijn niet in acht is genomen ondanks het betrachten van in de gegeven omstandigheden geboden zorgvuldigheid.  

b. Het verzoek krachtens paragraaf a wordt ingediend bij het aangewezen bureau en de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen dienen te worden verricht binnen de termijn die het eerst verstrijkt: 

i. twee maanden na de datum waarop de oorzaak van de niet-inachtneming van de desbetreffende termijn krachtens artikel 22 is weggenomen; of  

ii. twaalf maanden na de datum waarop de desbetreffende termijn krachtens artikel 22 verstrijkt; mits de aanvrager het verzoek op een later tijdstip mag indienen indien zulks wordt toegestaan door het van toepassing zijnde en door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale recht.    

c. In het verzoek krachtens paragraaf a worden de redenen vermeld voor het niet in acht nemen van de desbetreffende termijn krachtens artikel 22.  

d. Het van toepassing zijnde, door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale recht kan voorschrijven dat: 

i. een taks wordt betaald ter zake van een verzoek krachtens paragraaf a;  

ii. een verklaring of andere bewijzen worden ingediend ter staving van de in paragraaf c bedoelde redenen.    

e. Het aangewezen bureau wijst geen verzoeken krachtens paragraaf a af zonder de aanvrager in de gelegenheid te stellen binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn bezwaar te maken tegen de beoogde afwijzing.

De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationaal Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.     

### Regel  49bis  

####Vermeldingen ten aanzien van de beoogde bescherming ten behoeve van nationale behandeling

49bis.1.   *Keuze van bepaalde soorten bescherming*  

a. Indien de aanvrager verlangt dat de internationale aanvrage in een aangewezen Staat waarop artikel 43 van toepassing is, niet wordt behandeld als een aanvrage om de verlening van een octrooi, maar om de verlening van een ander soort bescherming bedoeld in dat artikel, meldt de aanvrager bij het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen dit aan het aangewezen bureau.  

b. Indien de aanvrager verlangt dat de internationale aanvrage in een aangewezen Staat waarop artikel 44 van toepassing is, wordt behandeld als een aanvrage om verlening van meer dan een soort bescherming bedoeld in artikel 43, meldt de aanvrager, bij het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen, dit aan het aangewezen bureau en geeft, indien van toepassing, aan welke soort bescherming primair wordt verlangd en welke subsidiair.  

c. In de in paragrafen a en b bedoelde gevallen, indien de aanvrager verlangt dat de internationale aanvrage in een aangewezen Staat wordt behandeld als een aanvrage om een aanvullingsoctrooi, een aanvullingscertificaat, een aanvulling van een uitvinderscertificaat of een aanvulling van een gebruikscertificaat, vermeldt de aanvrager bij het verrichten van de handelingen bedoeld in artikel 22, de desbetreffende hoofdaanvrage, het hoofdoctrooi of een ander verleend hoofdrecht.  

d. Indien de aanvrager verlangt dat de internationale aanvrage in een aangewezen Staat wordt behandeld als een aanvrage om voortzetting of gedeeltelijke voortzetting van een eerdere aanvrage, meldt de aanvrager bij het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen, dit aan het aangewezen bureau en vermeldt daarbij de desbetreffende hoofdaanvrage.  

e. Wanneer de aanvrager bij het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen geen uitdrukkelijke melding ingevolge paragraaf a heeft gedaan, maar de door hem betaalde nationale taks bedoeld in artikel 22 overeenkomt met de nationale taks voor een specifiek soort bescherming, wordt de betaling van die taks beschouwd als melding van de wens van de aanvrager dat de internationale aanvrage dient te worden behandeld als een aanvrage om dat soort bescherming en stelt het aangewezen bureau de aanvrager daarvan in kennis.     
49bis.2.   *Tijdstip voor meldingen*  

a. Aangewezen bureaus mogen niet verlangen dat de aanvrager, vóór het verrichten van de in artikel 22 bedoelde handelingen, meldingen doet als bedoeld in Regel 49 *bis*.1, of, indien van toepassing, meldt of hij verlening van een nationaal octrooi of een regionaal octrooi verlangt.  

b. De aanvrager kan, indien zulks is toegestaan krachtens de nationale wetgeving die moet worden toegepast door het betrokken aangewezen bureau, op een later tijdstip een dergelijke melding doen of, indien van toepassing, van de ene soort bescherming overstappen op de andere.     

### Regel  49ter  

####Rechtsgevolgen van het herstel van een recht van voorrang door het ontvangende bureau; Herstel van een recht van voorrang door het aangewezen bureau

49ter 1.   *Rechtsgevolgen van het herstel van een recht van voorrang door het ontvangende bureau*  

a. Indien het ontvangende bureau een recht van voorrang heeft hersteld ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 op grond van het feit dat het heeft vastgesteld dat het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen is ontstaan ondanks het feit dat de in de gegeven omstandigheden nodige zorg was betracht, heeft dat herstel, met inachtneming van paragraaf c, rechtsgevolgen in elke aangewezen Staat.  

b. Indien het ontvangende bureau een recht van voorrang ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 heeft hersteld op grond van het feit dat het heeft vastgesteld dat het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen onopzettelijk is ontstaan, heeft dat herstel, met inachtneming van paragraaf c, rechtsgevolgen in elke aangewezen Staat waarvan het van toepassing zijnde nationale recht voorziet in herstel van het recht van voorrang op grond van dat criterium of op grond van een criterium dat vanuit het oogpunt van de aanvragers gunstiger is dan dat criterium.  

c. Een beslissing van het ontvangende bureau een recht van voorrang te herstellen ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 heeft geen rechtsgevolgen in een aangewezen Staat indien het aangewezen bureau, een gerechtelijke instantie of een ander bevoegd orgaan van of optredend voor die aangewezen Staat vaststelt dat niet voldaan is aan een vereiste ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 a, b i of c, waarbij de in het bij het ontvangende bureau ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 a ingediende verzoek en andere ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 b iii bij het ontvangende bureau ingediende verklaringen of bewijs vermelde redenen in aanmerking worden genomen.  

d. Een aangewezen bureau gaat uitsluitend over tot herziening van de beslissing van het ontvangende bureau indien het redelijkerwijs betwijfelt of aan een in paragraaf c genoemd vereiste is voldaan, in welk geval het aangewezen bureau de aanvrager dienovereenkomstig in kennis stelt, waarbij de redenen voor de twijfel worden vermeld en de aanvrager in de gelegenheid wordt gesteld binnen een redelijke termijn bezwaar te maken.  

e. Een aangewezen Staat is niet gebonden door een beslissing van het ontvangende bureau een verzoek ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 3 om herstel van een recht van voorrang af te wijzen.  

f. Indien het ontvangende bureau een verzoek om herstel van een recht van voorrang heeft afgewezen, kan een aangewezen bureau dat verzoek aanmerken als een verzoek om herstel dat ingevolge Regel 49 *ter* 2 a bij dat aangewezen bureau binnen de termijn ingevolge die Regel is ingediend.  

g. Indien de paragrafen a tot en met d op 5 oktober 2005 niet verenigbaar zijn met de door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale wetgeving, zijn die paragrafen niet van toepassing op dat bureau zolang zij niet verenigbaar zijn met die wetgeving, mits genoemd bureau het Internationale Bureau hiervan in kennis stelt voor 5 april 2006. De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.     
49ter 2.   *Herstel van een recht van voorrang door het aangewezen bureau*  

a. Indien in de internationale aanvrage een beroep wordt gedaan op de voorrang van een eerdere aanvrage en deze internationale aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die later valt dan de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang is verstreken, maar binnen een tijdvak van twee maanden na die datum, herstelt het aangewezen bureau op verzoek van de aanvrager en met inachtneming van paragraaf b, het recht van voorrang indien het bureau vaststelt dat aan een door hem gehanteerd criterium (criterium voor herstel) is voldaan, namelijk dat het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen: 

i. was ontstaan ondanks het feit dat de in de gegeven omstandigheden nodige zorg was betracht; of  

ii. onopzettelijk was ontstaan. Elk aangewezen bureau hanteert ten minste een van die criteria en kan ook beide hanteren.    

b. Een verzoek op grond van paragraaf a: 

i. wordt binnen een maand na de ingevolge artikel 22 van toepassing zijnde termijn ingediend bij het aangewezen bureau;  

ii. bevat de redenen voor het verzuim de internationale aanvrage binnen de termijn van voorrang in te dienen en gaat bij voorkeur vergezeld van een verklaring of andere ingevolge paragraaf c vereiste bewijzen; en  

iii. gaat vergezeld van een taks voor een verzoek om herstel zoals vereist ingevolge paragraaf d.    

c. Het aangewezen bureau kan vereisen dat een verklaring of andere bewijzen ter staving van de redenen bedoeld in paragraaf b ii bij hem worden ingediend binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn.  

d. Het aangewezen bureau kan voor de indiening van een verzoek ingevolge paragraaf a als voorwaarde stellen dat ten gunste van hem een taks voor een verzoek om herstel wordt betaald.  

e. Het aangewezen bureau wijst geen verzoek ingevolge paragraaf a geheel of gedeeltelijk af zonder de aanvrager in de gelegenheid te stellen binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn bezwaar te maken tegen de beoogde afwijzing. Het aangewezen bureau kan de aanvrager een dergelijke kennisgeving inzake de beoogde afwijzing toezenden tezamen met een uitnodiging een verklaring of ander bewijs ingevolge paragraaf c in te dienen.  

f. Indien het door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale recht ter zake van het herstel van een recht van voorrang voorziet in vereisten die, vanuit het oogpunt van de aanvragers gunstiger zijn dan de vereisten voorzien in de paragrafen a en b, kan het aangewezen bureau, bij het vaststellen van het recht van voorrang de vereisten uit hoofde van het van toepassing zijnde nationale recht toepassen in plaats van de vereisten uit hoofde van die paragrafen.  

g. Elk aangewezen bureau stelt het Internationale Bureau in kennis van welk van de criteria voor herstel het toepast, van de vereisten, indien van toepassing, van het van toepassing zijnde nationale recht in overeenstemming met paragraaf f en van eventuele latere wijzigingen in dat opzicht. Het Internationale Bureau publiceert dergelijke informatie onverwijld in het mededelingenblad.  

h. Indien de paragrafen a tot en met g op 5 oktober 2005 niet verenigbaar zijn met de door het aangewezen bureau toegepaste nationale wetgeving, zijn die paragrafen niet van toepassing op dat bureau zolang zij niet verenigbaar zijn met die wetgeving, mits genoemd bureau het Internationale Bureau hiervan in kennis stelt voor 5 april 2006. De ontvangen informatie wordt door het Internationale Bureau onverwijld gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.

### Regel  54bis  

####Termijn voor het indienen van een verzoek

### Regel  55  

####Talen (internationale voorlopige beoordeling)

55.1.   *Taal van het verzoek*  Het verzoek dient te zijn gesteld in de taal van de internationale aanvrage of, indien de internationale aanvrage is ingediend in een andere taal dan die waarin zij wordt gepubliceerd, in de taal van de publikatie. Indien er echter een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage vereist is ingevolge Regel 55.2, dient het verzoek te zijn gesteld in de taal van die vertaling.   
55.2.   *Vertaling van de internationale aanvrage*  

a. Wanneer noch de taal waarin de internationale aanvrage wordt ingediend, noch de taal waarin de internationale aanvrage wordt gepubliceerd, door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling die de internationale voorlopige beoordeling moet uitvoeren wordt geaccepteerd, dient de aanvrager, onverminderd paragraaf b, tezamen met het verzoek een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage te verstrekken in een taal die zowel: 

i. door die Instantie wordt geaccepteerd, als  

ii. een taal van publicatie is.    

a-bis. Een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage in een taal bedoeld in paragraaf a dient een element te bevatten zoals bedoeld in artikel 11, eerste lid, onder iii d of e, verstrekt door de aanvrager ingevolge Regel 20.3 b of 20.6 a en elk deel van de beschrijving, conclusies of tekeningen verstrekt door de aanvrager ingevolge Regel 20.5 b of 20.6 a. dat geacht wordt te zijn begrepen in de internationale aanvrage ingevolge Regel 20.6 b.  

a-ter. De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling controleert of elke ingevolge paragraaf a verstrekte vertaling aan de in Regel 11 genoemde vormvoorschriften voldoet voor zover dat noodzakelijk is voor een internationale voorlopige beoordeling.  

b. Wanneer een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage in een in paragraaf a bedoelde taal ingevolge Regel 23.1 b aan de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek is toegezonden en de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling deel uitmaakt van hetzelfde nationale bureau of dezelfde intergouvernementele organisatie als de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, behoeft de aanvrager geen vertaling ingevolge paragraaf a te verstrekken. In dat geval wordt, tenzij de aanvrager een vertaling verstrekt ingevolge paragraaf a, de internationale voorlopige beoordeling verricht op basis van de ingevolge Regel 23.1 b toegezonden vertaling.  

c. Indien niet voldaan wordt aan een in de paragrafen a, a- *bis* en a- *ter* genoemde eis en paragraaf b niet van toepassing is, nodigt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de aanvrager uit de vereiste vertaling of de vereiste verbetering, al naargelang van het geval, te verstrekken binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn. Die termijn mag niet korter zijn dan een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging. De termijn kan te allen tijde voordat een beslissing is genomen worden verlengd door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

d. Indien de aanvrager binnen de in paragraaf c genoemde termijn aan de uitnodiging gevolg geeft, wordt de genoemde eis als verwezenlijkt beschouwd. Indien de aanvrager dat verzuimt, wordt het verzoek geacht niet te zijn ingediend en zal de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling dit bekendmaken.     
55.3.   *Taal en vertaling van wijzigingen en brieven*  

(a) Indien de internationale aanvrage is ingediend in een andere taal dan de taal waarin zij gepubliceerd wordt, dient, onverminderd paragraaf (b), elke wijziging ingevolge artikel 34, alsmede elke brief bedoeld in Regel 66.8(a), Regel 66.8(b) en Regel 46.5(b) zoals van toepassing ingevolge Regel 66.8(c), te worden ingediend in de taal van publicatie.  

(b) Wanneer een vertaling van de internationale aanvrage vereist is ingevolge Regel 55.2, dient: 

(i) elke wijziging en elke brief bedoeld in onderdeel (a); en  

(ii) elke wijziging ingevolge artikel 19 die in aanmerking dient te worden genomen ingevolge Regel 66.1(c) of (d) en elke brief bedoeld in Regel 46.5(b);   te zijn gesteld in de taal van die vertaling. Wanneer dergelijke wijzigingen of brieven zijn of worden ingediend in een andere taal, dient ook een vertaling te worden ingediend.  

(c) Indien een wijziging of brief niet wordt ingediend in een ingevolge paragraaf (a) of (b) vereiste taal, nodigt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de aanvrager uit de wijziging of brief in de vereiste taal in te dienen binnen een termijn die gezien de omstandigheden redelijk is. Die termijn mag niet korter zijn dan een maand te rekenen vanaf de datum van de uitnodiging. De termijn kan te allen tijde voordat een beslissing is genomen worden verlengd door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

(d) Indien de aanvrager binnen de termijn ingevolge paragraaf (c) verzuimt gevolg te geven aan de uitnodiging een wijziging in de vereiste taal te verstrekken, wordt de wijziging niet in aanmerking genomen ten behoeve van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling. Indien de aanvrager binnen de termijn ingevolge paragraaf (c) verzuimt gevolg te geven aan de uitnodiging een brief bedoeld in paragraaf (a) in de vereiste taal te verstrekken, hoeft de desbetreffende wijziging niet in aanmerking te worden genomen ten behoeve van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling.     

### Regel  57  

####De behandelingstaks

57.1.   *Vereiste van betaling*  Voor elk verzoek om een internationale voorlopige beoordeling is een taks ten gunste van het Internationale Bureau („behandelingstaks”) verschuldigd.

b) De behandelingstaks dient te worden betaald in de valuta of een van de valuta’s die door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling zijn voorgeschreven („voorgeschreven valuta”).  

c) Indien de Zwitserse frank de voorgeschreven valuta is, maakt de Instantie de bedoelde taks onverwijld in Zwitserse frank over naar het Internationale Bureau.  

d) Indien een andere dan de Zwitserse frank de voorgeschreven valuta is en die valuta: 

i. vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in Zwitserse frank, stelt de Directeur-Generaal voor elke Instantie die een dergelijke valuta voorschrijft voor de betaling van de behandelingstaks, een equivalent bedrag van die taks in de voorgeschreven valuta vast overeenkomstig de door de Algemene Vergadering gegeven richtlijnen en wordt het bedrag in die valuta onverwijld door de Instantie naar het Internationale Bureau overgemaakt;  

ii. niet vrijelijk kan worden omgewisseld in Zwitserse frank, is de Instantie verantwoordelijk voor het omwisselen van de behandelingstaks van de voorgeschreven valuta in Zwitserse frank en maakt zij die taks in het bedrag als vermeld in de Taksenschaal in Zwitserse frank onverwijld over naar het Internationale Bureau.   Als alternatief kan de Instantie desgewenst de behandelingstaks van de voorgeschreven valuta omwisselen in euro of Amerikaanse dollar en het equivalente bedrag van die taks zoals vastgesteld door de Directeur-Generaal overeenkomstig door de Algemene Vergadering gegeven richtlijnen, als bedoeld onder i, onverwijld in euro of Amerikaanse dollar overmaken naar het Internationale Bureau.     
57.3.   *Termijn voor betaling; te betalen bedrag*  

a. Onverminderd het bepaalde onder de paragrafen b en c dient de behandelingstaks te worden betaald binnen een maand na de datum waarop het verzoek is ingediend of 22 maanden na de datum van voorrang, naar gelang van welke termijn het laatst verstrijkt.  

b.

c. Wanneer, in overeenstemming met Regel 69.1 b de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de internationale voorlopige beoordeling gelijktijdig met het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek wenst te starten, nodigt deze Instantie de aanvrager uit de behandelingstaks binnen 1 maand na de datum van de uitnodiging te betalen.  

d. Het bedrag van de behandelingstaks is het bedrag dat van toepassing is op de datum van betaling.     
57.4.   *Terugbetaling*  De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling betaalt de behandelingstaks aan de aanvrager terug: 

i. indien het verzoek wordt ingetrokken voordat het door die Instantie is toegezonden aan het Internationale Bureau, of  

ii. indien het verzoek ingevolge Regel 54.4 of 54 *bis*.l b als niet ingediend wordt beschouwd.     

### Regel  58  

####De taks voor voorlopige beoordeling

58.1.   *Het recht een taks te vragen*  

a) Elke Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling kan verlangen dat de aanvrager te haren gunste een taks betaalt („taks voor voorlopige beoordeling”) voor het verrichten van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling en voor het vervullen van alle andere taken die ingevolge het Verdrag en dit Reglement aan Instanties voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling zijn opgedragen.  

b) Het bedrag van de taks voor voorlopige beoordeling, indien verschuldigd, wordt vastgesteld door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling. Met betrekking tot de termijn voor betaling van de taks voor voorlopige beoordeling en het te betalen bedrag zijn de bepalingen van Regel 57.3 inzake de behandelingstaks van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

c) De taks voor voorlopige beoordeling dient rechtstreeks aan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling te worden betaald. Wanneer deze Instantie een nationaal bureau is, dient de taks te worden betaald in de door dat bureau voorgeschreven valuta en wanneer de Instantie een intergouvernementele organisatie is, dient de taks te worden betaald in de valuta van de Staat waarin de intergouvernementele organisatie is gevestigd of in een andere valuta die vrij inwisselbaar is in de valuta van de genoemde Staat.     
58.2.   Vervallen.    
58.3.   *Terugbetaling*  De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling deelt het Internationale Bureau mede of zij, en zo ja, in welke mate en onder welke voorwaarden, een bedrag dat als taks voor voorlopige beoordeling is betaald zal terugbetalen, indien het verzoek als niet ingediend wordt beschouwd, en het Internationale Bureau zal zodanige mededeling onverwijld publiceren.

59.3.   *Toezending van een verzoek aan de bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling*  

a. Indien het verzoek wordt ingediend bij een ontvangend bureau, een Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, of een Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling die niet bevoegd is voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling van de desbetreffende internationale aanvrage, zal dat bureau of die Instantie de datum van ontvangst op het verzoek vermelden en het, tenzij het besluit over te gaan tot de handelingen ingevolge paragraaf f, zo spoedig mogelijk aan het Internationaal Bureau toezenden.  

b. Indien het verzoek wordt ingediend bij het Internationaal Bureau, vermeldt het Internationaal Bureau de datum van ontvangst op het verzoek.  

c. Wanneer het verzoek aan het Internationaal Bureau wordt toegezonden ingevolge paragraaf a of bij dit Bureau wordt ingediend ingevolge paragraaf b, zal het Internationaal Bureau onverwijld: 

i. indien er slechts één bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling is, het verzoek aan die Instantie toezenden en de aanvrager daarvan op de hoogte brengen, of  

ii. indien twee of meer Instanties voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling bevoegd zijn, de aanvrager uitnodigen binnen de ingevolge Regel 54 *bis*. 1 a toepasselijke termijn of 15 dagen na de datum van de uitnodiging, naargelang van welke datum het laatst is, aan te geven aan welke bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling het verzoek moet worden toegezonden.    

d. Wanneer een vermelding als vereist ingevolge paragraaf c ii wordt verstrekt, zendt het Internationaal Bureau het verzoek zo spoedig mogelijk aan de door de aanvrager aangewezen bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.

e. Wanneer het verzoek ingevolge paragraaf c wordt toegezonden aan een bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, wordt het beschouwd als ontvangen namens die Instantie op de ingevolge paragraaf a dan wel b erop vermelde datum, en wordt het aldus toegezonden verzoek beschouwd als op die datum door die Instantie ontvangen.  

f. Wanneer een bureau of Instantie waarbij het verzoek ingevolge paragraaf a is ingediend besluit dat verzoek rechtstreeks aan de bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling toe te zenden, zijn de paragrafen c tot en met e van overeenkomstige toepassing.

Onverminderd het bepaalde onder de paragrafen a- *bis* en a- *ter* nodigt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, indien het verzoek niet voldoet aan de vereisten neergelegd in de Regels 53.1, 53.2 a i tot en met iii, 53.2 b, 53.3 tot en met 53.8 en 55.1, de aanvrager uit de gebreken te verbeteren binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn. Die termijn mag niet korter zijn dan een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging. De termijn kan te allen tijde voordat een besluit is genomen worden verlengd door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

a-bis. Voor de toepassing van Regel 53.4 volstaat het, wanneer er meer dan een aanvrager is, dat de gegevens bedoeld in Regel 4.5 a ii. en iii. ten aanzien van een van hen worden verstrekt die ingevolge Regel 54.2 het recht heeft een verzoek in te dienen.  

a-ter. Voor de toepassing van Regel 53.8 volstaat het, indien er meer dan een aanvrager is, dat het verzoek door een van hen wordt ondertekend.  

b. Indien de aanvrager binnen de in paragraaf a genoemde termijn gevolg geeft aan het verzoek, wordt het verzoek beschouwd als ontvangen op de feitelijke datum van indiening, mits de internationale aanvrage aan de hand van het ingediende verzoek kan worden achterhaald; in het andere geval wordt het verzoek beschouwd als ontvangen op de datum waarop de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de verbetering ontvangt.  

c. Indien de aanvrager niet binnen de in paragraaf a bedoelde termijn gevolg geeft aan de uitnodiging, wordt het verzoek als niet ingediend beschouwd en wordt dit bekendgemaakt door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

d.  Vervallen.   

e. Indien het gebrek wordt ontdekt door het Internationale Bureau, brengt het het gebrek ter kennis van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, die vervolgens handelt zoals voorzien in de paragrafen a tot en met c.  

f. Indien het verzoek geen verklaring betreffende wijzigingen bevat, handelt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling als bepaald in de Regels 66.1 en 69.1 a of b.  

g. Wanneer de verklaring betreffende wijzigingen een vermelding bevat dat er wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 34 worden ingediend met het verzoek (Regel 53.9 c), maar er in feite geen wijzigingen zijn ingediend ingevolge artikel 34, nodigt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de aanvrager uit de wijzigingen in te dienen binnen een in de uitnodiging vastgestelde termijn en handelt zij als bepaald in Regel 69.1 e.

### Regel  64  

####Stand van de techniek voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling

64.1.   *Stand van de techniek*  

a) Voor de toepassing van artikel 33, tweede en derde lid, wordt alles wat, waar ook ter wereld, ter beschikking van het publiek is gesteld door middel van schriftelijke publikatie (met inbegrip van tekeningen en andere illustraties) als stand van de techniek beschouwd, mits dit ter beschikking stellen van het publiek plaatsvond voor de van belang zijnde datum.  

b) Voor de toepassing van paragraaf a is de van belang zijnde datum: 

i. onverminderd ii en iii, de datum van internationale indiening van de internationale aanvrage die het voorwerp is van een internationale voorlopige beoordeling;  

ii. indien in de internationale aanvrage die het voorwerp is van een internationale voorlopige beoordeling een beroep wordt gedaan op een recht van voorrang van een eerdere aanvrage en die aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die valt binnen de termijn van voorrang, de datum van indiening van de eerdere aanvrage, tenzij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling oordeelt dat het beroep op een recht van voorrang niet rechtsgeldig is;  

iii. indien in de internationale aanvrage die het voorwerp is van een internationale voorlopige beoordeling een beroep wordt gedaan op een recht van voorrang van een eerdere aanvrage en die aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die later valt dan de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang verstreek maar minder dan twee maanden na die datum, de datum van indiening van die eerdere aanvrage, tenzij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling oordeelt dat het beroep op een recht van voorrang niet rechtsgeldig is om andere redenen dan het feit dat de internationale aanvrage een datum van internationale indiening heeft die later valt dan de datum waarop de termijn van voorrang verstreek.       
64.2.   *Niet-schriftelijke openbaarmakingen*  In gevallen waarin het ter beschikking stellen van het publiek plaatsvond door middel van een mondelinge uiteenzetting, een gebruik, een tentoonstelling of op andere niet-schriftelijke wijze („niet-schriftelijke openbaarmaking”) voor de van belang zijnde datum als omschreven in Regel 64.1 b en de datum van deze niet-schriftelijke openbaarmaking is aangegeven in een schriftelijke publikatie die ter beschikking van het publiek is gesteld op een datum die dezelfde is als, of later valt dan, de van belang zijnde datum, wordt de niet-schriftelijke openbaarmaking voor de toepassing van artikel 33, tweede en derde lid, niet tot de stand van de techniek gerekend. Niettemin dient het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling de aandacht op deze niet-schriftelijke openbaarmaking te vestigen op de in Regel 70.9 voorgeschreven wijze.   
64.3.   *Bepaalde gepubliceerde literatuurplaatsen*  In gevallen waarin een aanvrage die, of een octrooi dat voor de toepassing van artikel 33, tweede en derde lid, zou behoren tot de stand van de techniek, indien zij of het zou zijn gepubliceerd voor de in Regel 64.1 bedoelde van belang zijnde datum, werd gepubliceerd op een datum die dezelfde is als, of later valt dan, de van belang zijnde datum, doch werd ingediend voor de van belang zijnde datum of daarbij een beroep werd gedaan op een recht van voorrang ten aanzien van een eerdere aanvrage die was ingediend voor de van belang zijnde datum, wordt deze gepubliceerde aanvrage of dit gepubliceerde octrooi voor de toepassing van artikel 33, tweede en derde lid, niet tot de stand van de techniek gerekend. Niettemin dient het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling de aandacht op deze aanvrage of dit octrooi te vestigen op de in Regel 70.10 voorgeschreven wijze.   

### Regel  65  

####Uitvinderswerkzaamheid of niet voor de hand liggen

65.1.   *Samenhang met de stand van de techniek*  Voor de toepassing van artikel 33, derde lid, wordt bij de internationale voorlopige beoordeling rekening gehouden met de samenhang tussen een bepaalde conclusie en de stand van de techniek in zijn geheel. Er dient rekening te worden gehouden met de samenhang van de conclusie niet alleen met afzonderlijke literatuurplaatsen of afzonderlijk daarvan beschouwde delen, maar ook met haar samenhang met combinaties van deze literatuurplaatsen of delen van literatuurplaatsen, wanneer deze combinaties voor een deskundige voor de hand liggen.   
65.2.   *Van belang zijnde datum*  Voor de toepassing van artikel 33, derde lid, is de van belang zijnde datum voor de beoordeling van uitvinderswerkzaamheid (het niet voor de hand liggen) de in Regel 64.1 voorgeschreven datum.   

### Regel  66  

####Procedure voor de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling

66.1.   *Grondslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling*  

a. Behoudens het in de paragrafen b tot en met d bepaalde, wordt de internationale voorlopige beoordeling gebaseerd op de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend.  

b. De aanvrager kan wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 34 indienen bij de indiening van het verzoek of, onverminderd Regel 66.4 *bis*, totdat het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling wordt opgesteld.  

c. Wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 19 die zijn aangebracht voordat het verzoek werd ingediend, worden in aanmerking genomen voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling, tenzij deze worden vervangen, of worden geacht te zijn achterhaald, door een wijziging ingevolge artikel 34.  

d. Wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 19 die zijn aangebracht nadat het verzoek werd ingediend en wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 34 die zijn ingediend bij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, worden, onverminderd Regel 66.4 *bis*, in aanmerking genomen voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling.  

d-bis. Een ingevolge Regel 91.1 toegestane verbetering van een kennelijke fout wordt ten behoeve van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling met inachtneming van Regel 66.4 *bis* in aanmerking genomen door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

e. Conclusies met betrekking tot uitvindingen ten aanzien waarvan geen verslag van een internationaal nieuwheidsonderzoek is opgesteld, behoeven niet het voorwerp te vormen van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling.     
66.1bis.   *Schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek*  

a. Onverminderd paragraaf b., wordt het ingevolge Regel 43 *bis*. 1 door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek opgestelde schriftelijke oordeel beschouwd als een schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling voor de toepassing van Regel 66.2 a.  

b. Een Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling kan het Internationaal Bureau ervan in kennis stellen dat op de voor haar te voeren procedure paragraaf a. niet van toepassing is ter zake van schriftelijke oordelen ingevolge Regel 43 *bis.* 1, opgesteld door de in de kennisgeving vermelde Instantie of Instanties voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, met dien verstande dat deze kennisgeving niet van toepassing is op gevallen waarin het nationaal bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie die is opgetreden als Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek tevens optreedt als Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling. Het Internationaal Bureau publiceert een dergelijke kennisgeving onverwijld in het mededelingenblad.  

c. Wanneer het ingevolge Regel 43 *bis*. 1 door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek opgestelde schriftelijk oordeel, uit hoofde van een kennisgeving ingevolge paragraaf b., niet wordt aangemerkt als een schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling voor de toepassing van Regel 66.2 a., stelt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling de aanvrager dienovereenkomstig schriftelijk daarvan in kennis.  

d. Een ingevolge Regel 43 *bis*. 1 door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek opgesteld schriftelijk oordeel, dat uit hoofde van een kennisgeving ingevolge paragraaf b., niet wordt aangemerkt als een schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige beoordeling voor de toepassing van Regel 66.2 a., wordt desalniettemin door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige beoordeling in aanmerking genomen in de procedure ingevolge Regel 66.2 a.     
66.2.   *Schriftelijk oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling*  

a) Indien de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling 

(i) van oordeel is dat er sprake is van een van de in artikel 34, vierde lid, bedoelde omstandigheden,  

(ii) van oordeel is dat het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling negatief dient te zijn ten aanzien van enige conclusie omdat de uitvinding waarvoor daarin bescherming wordt gevraagd niet nieuw lijkt te zijn, niet op uitvinderswerkzaamheid lijkt te berusten (niet voor de hand lijkt te liggen) of niet vatbaar lijkt voor toepassing op het gebied van de nijverheid,  

(iii) opmerkt dat er een gebrek is in de vorm of de inhoud van de internationale aanvrage ingevolge het Verdrag of dit Reglement,  

(iv) van oordeel is dat een wijziging verder gaat dan de openbaarmaking in de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend,  

(v) het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling vergezeld wenst te doen gaan van opmerkingen over de duidelijkheid van de conclusies, de beschrijving en de tekeningen of de vraag of de conclusies ten volle door de beschrijving worden ondersteund, dient genoemde Instantie de aanvrager daarvan schriftelijk in kennis te stellen. Wanneer de nationale wetgeving van het nationale bureau dat optreedt als Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling niet toestaat dat meervoudig afhankelijke conclusies worden opgesteld op een wijze die afwijkt van hetgeen is aangegeven in de tweede en derde zin van Regel 6.4 a), kan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, ingeval van niet-volgen van die wijze van opstellen, artikel 34, vierde lid, onder b) toepassen. In zo'n geval stelt het de aanvrager hiervan schriftelijk in kennis,  

(vi) van oordeel is dat een conclusie betrekking heeft op een uitvinding ten aanzien waarvan geen verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek is opgesteld en heeft besloten geen internationale voorlopige beoordeling te verrichten ten aanzien van die conclusie, of  

(vii) van oordeel is dat er geen sequentie-opsomming van nucleotiden en/of aminozuren beschikbaar is in zodanige vorm dat er een zinvolle internationale voorlopige beoordeling kan worden verricht,   dient genoemde Instantie de aanvrager daarvan schriftelijk in kennis te stellen. Wanneer de nationale wetgeving van het nationale bureau dat als Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling optreedt, niet toestaat dat er meervoudig afhankelijke conclusies worden opgesteld op een andere wijze dan voorgeschreven in de tweede en derde volzin van Regel 6.4 a, kan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, ingeval de conclusies niet op die wijze worden ingediend, artikel 34, vierde lid, b, toepassen. In dat geval dient zij de aanvrager daarvan schriftelijk in kennis te stellen.  

b) De kennisgeving dient een volledige uiteenzetting te geven van de redenen voor het oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

c) In de kennisgeving wordt de aanvrager uitgenodigd een schriftelijk antwoord in te dienen, waar passend vergezeld van wijzigingen.  

d) In de kennisgeving wordt een termijn vastgesteld voor het antwoord. De termijn dient redelijk te zijn gegeven de omstandigheden. De termijn bedraagt gewoonlijk twee maanden vanaf de datum van de kennisgeving. In geen geval mag de termijn korter zijn dan een maand na de bedoelde datum. De termijn dient ten minste twee maanden na de bedoelde datum te zijn wanneer het verslag van het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek tegelijkertijd met de kennisgeving wordt verzonden. De termijn mag, onverminderd paragraaf e. niet langer zijn dan drie maanden na de bedoelde datum.  

e) De termijn voor het beantwoorden van de kennisgeving kan worden verlengd indien de aanvrager voor het verstrijken ervan daarom verzoekt.     
66.3.   *Formeel antwoord aan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling*  

a) De aanvrager kan aan de in Regel 66.2 c) bedoelde uitnodiging van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling gehoor geven door wijzigingen aan te brengen, of - indien hij het niet eens is met het oordeel van die Instantie - door argumenten aan te voeren, al naar het geval, dan wel beide doen.  

b) Een antwoord dient rechtstreeks bij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling te worden ingediend.     
66.4.   *Bijkomende gelegenheid voor het indienen van wijzigingen of het aanvoeren van argumenten*  

a) Indien de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling een of meer bijkomende schriftelijke oordelen wenst te geven, kan zij zulks doen; in dit geval zijn de Regels 66.2 en 66.3 van toepassing.  

b) Op verzoek van de aanvrager kan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling hem één of meer bijkomende gelegenheden bieden om wijzigingen in te dienen of argumenten aan te voeren.     
66.4bis.   *In aanmerking nemen van wijzigingen, argumenten en verbeteringen van kennelijke fouten*  De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling behoeft geen wijzigingen, argumenten en verbeteringen van kennelijke fouten in aanmerking te nemen ten behoeve van een schriftelijk oordeel of het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling indien deze worden ontvangen of toegestaan door of ter kennis gebracht van die Instantie, naargelang hetgeen van toepassing is, nadat deze begonnen is met het opstellen van dat oordeel of verslag.   
66.5.   *Wijziging*  Een verandering, niet zijnde een verbetering van een kennelijke fout, in de conclusies, de beschrijving of de tekeningen, met inbegrip van de intrekking van conclusies, het schrappen van passages in de beschrijving of het schrappen van bepaalde tekeningen wordt aangemerkt als een wijziging.   
66.6.   *Informele contacten met de aanvrager*  De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling kan te allen tijde informeel, telefonisch, schriftelijk of door middel van persoonlijke gesprekken contact met de aanvrager onderhouden. De genoemde Instantie beslist naar eigen goeddunken, of zij meer dan één persoonlijk onderhoud wenst toe te staan, indien de aanvrager daarom verzoekt, dan wel of zij wenst te antwoorden op een informele schriftelijke mededeling van de aanvrager.   
66.7.   *Afschrift en vertaling van een eerdere aanvrage op grond waarvan de voorrang wordt ingeroepen*  

a) Indien de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling een afschrift nodig heeft van de eerdere aanvrage op grond waarvan de voorrang wordt ingeroepen in de internationale aanvrage, dient het Internationaal Bureau dat desgevraagd onverwijld te verstrekken. Indien dat afschrift niet wordt verstrekt aan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, omdat de aanvrager verzuimd heeft te voldoen aan de vereisten van Regel 17.1 en indien de eerdere aanvrage niet was ingediend bij die Instantie in haar hoedanigheid van nationaal bureau of indien het voorrangsbewijs voor die Instantie niet beschikbaar is via een digitale bibliotheek in overeenstemming met de Administratieve Instructies, kan het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling worden opgesteld als zou geen voorrang zijn ingeroepen.  

b) Indien de aanvrage op grond waarvan in de internationale aanvrage een recht van voorrang is ingeroepen in een andere taal is gesteld dan de taal of een van de talen van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling kan die Instantie, wanneer de geldigheid van het beroep op een recht van voorrang van betekenis is voor het formuleren van het in artikel 33, eerste lid, bedoelde oordeel, de aanvrager uitnodigen een vertaling in die taal of een van die talen te verstrekken binnen 2 maanden te rekenen vanaf de datum van de uitnodiging. Indien de vertaling niet wordt verstrekt binnen die termijn, kan het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling worden opgesteld alsof het recht van voorrang niet was ingeroepen.     
66.8.   *Vorm van de wijzigingen*  

a. Onverminderd paragraaf b wordt van de aanvrager verlangd dat hij bij wijziging van de beschrijving of de tekeningen een vervangend blad indient voor elk blad van de internationale aanvrage dat wegens wijziging verschilt van het eerder ingediende blad. Het vervangende blad of de vervangende bladen gaat of gaan vergezeld van een brief, waarin de aandacht wordt gevestigd op de verschillen tussen de vervangen en de vervangende bladen, de grond voor de wijziging van de aanvrage zoals ingediend wordt aangeduid en bij voorkeur ook de redenen voor de wijziging worden verklaard.  

b. Wanneer de wijziging bestaat in het schrappen van passages of in kleine veranderingen of toevoegingen, kan het in paragraaf a genoemde vervangende blad een afschrift van het desbetreffende blad van de internationale aanvrage met de veranderingen of toevoegingen zijn, mits de duidelijkheid en de mogelijkheid tot directe verveelvoudiging van dat blad niet nadelig worden beïnvloed. Voor zover een wijziging leidt tot het vervallen van een geheel blad, wordt deze wijziging medegedeeld in een brief die bij voorkeur ook de redenen voor de wijziging verklaart.  

c. Bij wijziging van de conclusies is Regel 46.5 van overeenkomstige toepassing. Het stel conclusies, ingediend ingevolge Regel 46.5 zoals van toepassing uit hoofde van deze paragraaf, vervangt alle oorspronkelijk ingediende of ingevolge de artikelen 19 of 34 eerder gewijzigde conclusies, al naar gelang van het geval.     

### Regel  67  

####Onderwerpen ingevolge artikel 34, vierde lid, onder a) sub (i)

67.1.   *Begripsomschrijving*  Van een Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling mag niet worden verlangd, dat zij een internationale voorlopige beoordeling verricht van een internationale aanvrage, indien en voor zover het onderwerp op een van de onderstaande gebieden ligt: 

(i) natuurwetenschappelijke en wiskundige theorieën,  

(ii) planten- of dierenrassen of werkwijzen van wezenlijk biologische aard voor de voortbrenging van planten en dieren, die geen microbiologische werkwijzen en hierdoor verkregen voortbrengselen zijn,  

(iii) stelsels, regels of methoden voor de bedrijfsvoering, voor het verrichten van uitsluitend geestelijke handelingen of voor het spelen,  

(iv) methoden voor de behandeling van het menselijke of het dierlijke lichaam door chirurgische ingrepen of geneeskundige behandeling, alsmede methoden voor het stellen van een diagnose,  

(v) enkele presentatie van gegevens,  

(vi) programma's voor rekenautomaten voor zover de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling niet is uitgerust voor het verrichten van een internationale voorlopige beoordeling van zodanige programma's.     

### Regel  68  

####Gebrek aan eenheid van uitvinding (internationale voorlopige beoordeling)

68.1.   *Geen uitnodiging tot beperking of betaling*  Wanneer de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling vaststelt dat niet is voldaan aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding en verkiest de aanvrager niet uit te nodigen de conclusies te beperken of bijkomende taksen te betalen, zet zij de internationale voorlopige beoordeling voort, behoudens artikel 34, vierde lid, b, en Regel 66.1 e, ten aanzien van de gehele internationale aanvrage, maar vermeldt zij in elk schriftelijk oordeel en het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling dat zij van oordeel is dat niet is voldaan aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding en geeft zij de redenen daarvoor aan.   
68.2.   *Uitnodiging tot beperking of betaling*  Wanneer de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling vaststelt dat niet is voldaan aan de vereiste eenheid van uitvinding en verkiest de aanvrager uit te nodigen, naar zijn keuze, de conclusies te beperken of aanvullende taksen te betalen, dient in de uitnodiging: 

i. ten minste een mogelijkheid tot beperking te worden aangegeven die naar het oordeel van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling in overeenstemming zou zijn met het van toepassing zijnde vereiste;  

ii. aangegeven te worden op welke gronden de internationale aanvrage geacht wordt niet te voldoen aan de vereiste eenheid van uitvinding;  

iii. de aanvrager te worden uitgenodigd binnen een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging te voldoen aan de uitnodiging;  

iv. het bedrag van de te betalen vereiste bijkomende taksen te worden aangegeven, mocht de aanvrager daartoe besluiten; en  

v. dient de aanvrager, indien van toepassing, te worden uitgenodigd binnen een maand na de datum van de uitnodiging de in Regel 68.3 e bedoelde protesttaks te betalen en dient het te betalen bedrag te worden vermeld.     
68.3.   *Bijkomende taksen*  

a. Het bedrag voor de bijkomende taksen verschuldigd voor een internationale voorlopige beoordeling ingevolge artikel 34, derde lid, onder a, wordt bepaald door de bevoegde Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

b. De ingevolge artikel 34, derde lid, onder a, verschuldigde bijkomende taksen voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling dienen rechtstreeks te worden betaald aan de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling.  

c. Een aanvrager kan de bijkomende taksen onder protest betalen, dat wil zeggen, vergezeld van een met redenen omklede uiteenzetting dat de internationale aanvrage voldoet aan de vereiste eenheid van uitvinding of dat het bedrag van de vereiste bijkomende taksen buitensporig hoog is. Een zodanig protest dient te worden onderzocht door een in het kader van de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling ingesteld toetsingsorgaan, dat, voorzover het het protest gerechtvaardigd acht, beveelt dat de bijkomende taksen geheel of gedeeltelijk aan de aanvrager dienen te worden terugbetaald. Op verzoek van de aanvrager worden de tekst van het protest en van de beslissing dienaangaande als bijlage bij het verslag omtrent de internationale voorlopige beoordeling ter kennis van de gekozen bureaus gebracht.  

d. In het in paragraaf c bedoelde toetsingsorgaan kan de persoon zitting hebben die de beslissing nam waarop het protest betrekking heeft, met dien verstande dat deze niet het enige lid van het orgaan mag zijn.  

e. De Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling kan het onderzoek naar aanleiding van een protest zoals bedoeld in paragraaf c afhankelijk stellen van de betaling ten gunste van de Instantie van een protesttaks. Indien de aanvrager verzuimt binnen de termijn ingevolge Regel 68.2 v de vereiste protesttaks te betalen, wordt het protest geacht niet te zijn aangetekend en de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling zal dienaangaande een verklaring doen uitgaan. De protesttaks wordt aan de aanvrager terugbetaald indien het in paragraaf c bedoelde toetsingsorgaan van oordeel is dat het protest volledig gerechtvaardigd was.     
68.4.   *Procedure in geval van onvoldoende beperking van de conclusies*  Indien de aanvrager de conclusies beperkt, doch niet voldoende om te voldoen aan het vereiste van eenheid van uitvinding, handelt de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling zoals bepaald in artikel 34, derde lid, onder *c)*.   
68.5.   *Hoofduitvinding*  In geval van twijfel welke uitvinding de hoofduitvinding is voor de toepassing van artikel 34, derde lid, onder *c)*, wordt de als eerste in de conclusies genoemde uitvinding als de hoofduitvinding beschouwd.

b. Indien het nationaal bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie die optreedt als Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek tevens optreedt als Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling, kan de internationale voorlopige beoordeling, indien het nationaal bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie zulks wenst en met inachtneming van de paragrafen d. en e., op hetzelfde tijdstip aanvangen als het internationale nieuwheidsonderzoek.  

c. Wanneer de verklaring betreffende wijzigingen een vermelding bevat dat wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 19 in aanmerking moeten worden genomen (Regel 53.9 a i), begint de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling niet met de internationale voorlopige beoordeling voordat zij een afschrift van de desbetreffende wijzigingen heeft ontvangen.

e. Wanneer de verklaring betreffende wijzigingen een vermelding bevat dat er wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 34 worden ingediend met het verzoek (Regel 53.9 c), maar er in feite geen wijzigingen ingevolge artikel 34 zijn ingediend, begint de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling niet met de internationale voorlopige beoordeling voordat zij de wijzigingen heeft ontvangen of voordat de termijn vastgesteld in de in Regel 60.1 g bedoelde uitnodiging is verstreken, naar gelang van welke datum het eerst valt.     
69.2.   *Termijn voor de internationale voorlopige beoordeling*  De termijn voor het opstellen van het verslag van de internationale voorlopige beoordeling is van een van de volgende tijdvakken degene die het laatst verstrijkt:

91.1.   *Verbetering van kennelijke fouten*  

a. Een kennelijke fout in de internationale aanvrage of in een ander door de aanvrager ingediend document kan in overeenstemming met deze Regel worden verbeterd indien de aanvrager daarom verzoekt.  

b. Verbetering van een fout geschiedt op voorwaarde van machtiging door de „bevoegde autoriteit”, dat wil zeggen: 

i. in het geval van een fout in het deel van de internationale aanvrage dat het verzoekschrift bevat of in een verbetering daarvan – door het ontvangende bureau;  

ii. in het geval van een fout in de beschrijving, conclusies of tekeningen of in een verbetering daarvan, tenzij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling bevoegd is ingevolge iii – door de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek;  

iii. in het geval van een fout in de beschrijving, conclusies of tekeningen of in een verbetering daarvan, of in een wijziging ingevolge artikel 19 of 34, indien een verzoek om internationale voorlopige beoordeling is gedaan en niet is ingetrokken en de datum waarop de internationale voorlopige beoordeling aanvangt in overeenstemming met Regel 69.1 verstreken is – door de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling;  

iv. in het geval van een fout in een document dat niet genoemd wordt onder i tot iii en ingediend is bij het ontvangende bureau, de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling of het Internationale Bureau, niet zijnde een fout in het uittreksel of in een wijziging ingevolge artikel 19 – door dat bureau of die instantie, naargelang van het geval.    

c. De bevoegde autoriteit geeft uitsluitend een machtiging voor de verbetering van een fout ingevolge deze Regel indien het de bevoegde autoriteit duidelijk is dat op de van toepassing zijnde datum ingevolge paragraaf f iets anders beoogd was dan hetgeen in het desbetreffende document voorkomt en dat niets anders beoogd had kunnen zijn dan de voorgestelde verbetering.  

d. In het geval van een fout in de beschrijving, conclusies of tekeningen of in een verbetering of wijziging daarvan, neemt de bevoegde autoriteit voor de toepassing van paragraaf c uitsluitend de inhoud van de beschrijving, conclusies en tekeningen in aanmerking en, indien van toepassing, de desbetreffende verbetering of wijziging.  

e. In het geval van een fout in het deel van de internationale aanvrage die het verzoekschrift bevat of een verbetering daarvan, of in een document bedoeld in paragraaf b iv, neemt de bevoegde autoriteit voor de toepassing van paragraaf c uitsluitend de inhoud van de internationale aanvrage zelf en, indien van toepassing, de desbetreffende verbetering of het document bedoeld in paragraaf b iv in aanmerking, tezamen met eventuele andere met het verzoekschrift, de verbetering of document ingediende documenten, naargelang van het geval, een voorrangsbewijs ter zake van de internationale aanvrage dat de autoriteit in overeenstemming met de Administratieve Instructies ter beschikking staat, en eventuele andere documenten in het dossier van de autoriteit van de internationale aanvrage op de van toepassing zijnde datum ingevolge paragraaf f.  

f. De toepasselijke datum voor de toepassing van de paragrafen c en e is: 

i. in het geval van een fout in een onderdeel van de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend – de datum van internationale indiening;  

ii. in het geval van een fout in een document niet zijnde de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend, met inbegrip van fouten in een verbetering of wijziging van de internationale aanvrage – de datum waarop het document was ingediend.    

g. Een fout kan ingevolge deze Regel niet verbeterd worden indien: 

i. de fout gelegen is het ontbreken van een of meer volledige elementen van de internationale aanvrage bedoeld in artikel 3, tweede lid, of van een of meer volledige bladen van de internationale aanvrage;  

ii. de fout zich in het uittreksel bevindt;  

iii. de fout zich in een wijziging ingevolge artikel 19 bevindt, tenzij de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling bevoegd is een machtiging af te geven voor de verbetering van een dergelijke fout ingevolge paragraaf b iii; of  

iv. de fout zich in een beroep op een recht van voorrang of in een kennisgeving ten behoeve van verbetering of toevoeging van een beroep op een recht van voorrang ingevolge Regel 26 *bis* 1 a bevindt, indien de verbetering van de fout tot wijziging van de datum van voorrang zou leiden;   met dien verstande dat deze paragraaf de werking van de Regels 20.4, 20.5, 26 *bis* en 38.3 onverlet laat.  

h. Indien het ontvangende bureau, de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling of het Internationale Bureau een voor verbetering vatbare kennelijke fout ontdekt in de internationale aanvrage of in een ander document, kan dat bureau of die instantie de aanvrager uitnodigen te verzoeken om verbetering ingevolge deze Regel.     
91.2.   *Verzoeken om verbetering*  Een verzoek om verbetering ingevolge Regel 91.1 wordt binnen 26 maanden na de datum van voorrang ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit. In het verzoek dient de te verbeteren fout te worden aangeduid alsmede de voorgestelde verbetering, en kan, naar keuze van de aanvrager, een korte toelichting zijn opgenomen. Regel 26.4 is van overeenkomstige toepassing op de wijze waarop de voorgestelde verbetering wordt aangegeven.   
91.3.   *Machtiging en rechtsgevolgen van verbeteringen*  

a. De bevoegde autoriteit beslist onverwijld of zij een machtiging geeft voor een verbetering ingevolge Regel 91.1 of zulks weigert en stelt de aanvrager en het Internationale Bureau daarvan onverwijld in kennis, en bij weigering tevens van de redenen daarvoor. Het Internationale Bureau handelt zoals voorzien in de Administratieve Instructies, en stelt, zoals vereist, het ontvangende bureau, de Instantie voor Internationaal Nieuwheidsonderzoek, de Instantie voor de Internationale Voorlopige Beoordeling en de aangewezen en gekozen bureaus in kennis van de machtiging of weigering.  

b. Indien ingevolge Regel 91.1 een machtiging is verleend voor de verbetering van een kennelijke fout, dient het desbetreffende document in overeenstemming met de Administratieve Instructies te worden verbeterd.  

c. Indien machtiging is verleend voor de verbetering van een kennelijke fout is deze van kracht: 

i. in het geval van een fout in de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend – vanaf de datum van internationale indiening;  

ii. in het geval van een fout in een document niet zijnde de internationale aanvrage zoals ingediend, met inbegrip van fouten in een verbetering of wijziging van de internationale aanvrage – vanaf de datum waarop dat document was ingediend.    

d. Indien de bevoegde autoriteit een machtiging ingevolge Regel 91.1 weigert, publiceert het Internationale Bureau op een door de aanvrager bij het bureau ingediend verzoek binnen twee maanden na de datum van de weigering en op voorwaarde van de betaling van een bijzondere taks waarvan het bedrag is vastgesteld in de Administratieve Instructies, het verzoek om verbetering, de redenen voor de weigering door de autoriteit en eventueel nader kort commentaar dat door de aanvrager kan zijn ingediend, zo mogelijk tezamen met de internationale aanvrage. Een afschrift van het verzoek, de redenen en het eventuele commentaar worden overeenkomstig artikel 20 meegezonden wanneer de internationale aanvrage uit hoofde van artikel 64, derde lid, niet gepubliceerd wordt.  

e. De verbetering van een kennelijke fout behoeft door een aangewezen bureau niet in aanmerking te worden genomen waar de behandeling of de beoordeling van de internationale aanvrage reeds is aangevangen voor de datum waarop dat bureau ingevolge Regel 91.3 a in kennis is gesteld van de machtiging voor de verbetering door de bevoegde autoriteit.  

f. Een aangewezen bureau kan een verbetering waarvoor ingevolge Regel 91.1 een machtiging was afgegeven uitsluitend buiten beschouwing laten indien het vaststelt dat het geen machtiging voor de verbetering ingevolge Regel 91.1 zou hebben afgegeven indien het de bevoegde autoriteit zou zijn geweest, met dien verstande dat geen aangewezen bureau een verbetering waarvoor ingevolge Regel 91.1 een machtiging was afgegeven buiten beschouwing zal laten zonder de aanvrager in de gelegenheid te stellen binnen een gegeven de omstandigheden redelijke termijn bezwaar te maken tegen het voornemen van het bureau de verbetering buiten beschouwing te laten.

92.4.   *Gebruik van telegraaf, telex, fax, enz.*  

a. Een document dat de internationale aanvrage vormt en elk later document dat, of elke latere briefwisseling die daarop betrekking heeft, kan, niettegenstaande de Regels 11.14 en 92.1 a, maar onverminderd het in paragraaf h bepaalde, worden toegezonden, voor zover mogelijk, per telegraaf, telex, fax of ander soortgelijk communicatiemiddel dat resulteert in het indienen van een gedrukt of geschreven document.  

b. Een handtekening op een document dat per fax is toegezonden, wordt voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag en dit Reglement erkend als geldige handtekening.  

c. Wanneer de aanvrager heeft getracht een document toe te zenden via één van de in paragraaf a bedoelde communicatiemiddelen, maar het ontvangen document geheel of ten dele onleesbaar is of een gedeelte van het document niet is ontvangen, wordt het document als niet ontvangen beschouwd in zoverre het ontvangen document onleesbaar is of de poging tot toezending is mislukt. Het nationale bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie stelt de aanvrager hiervan onverwijld in kennis.  

d. Een nationaal bureau of intergouvernementele organisatie kan verlangen dat van een document dat is toegezonden via één van de in paragraaf a bedoelde communicatiemiddelen het origineel en een begeleidend schrijven waarin deze eerdere toezending wordt vermeld, worden verstrekt binnen 14 dagen te rekenen van de datum van toezending, mits het Internationale Bureau van dit vereiste in kennis is gesteld en het Internationale Bureau informatie hierover heeft gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad. In de kennisgeving dient te worden aangegeven of dit vereiste alle of slechts bepaalde soorten documenten betreft.  

e. Wanneer de aanvrager verzuimt het origineel van een document te verstrekken zoals vereist ingevolge paragraaf d, kan het betrokken nationale bureau of de betrokken intergouvernementele organisatie, afhankelijk van het soort document dat is toegezonden en met inachtneming van de Regels 11 en 26.3, 

i. afzien van het in paragraaf d bedoelde vereiste, of  

ii. de aanvrager uitnodigen, binnen een termijn die gezien de omstandigheden redelijk is en die in de uitnodiging is vastgesteld, het origineel van het toegezonden document alsnog te verstrekken,   met dien verstande dat, indien het toegezonden document gebreken bevat of laat zien dat het origineel gebreken bevat, ten aanzien waarvan het nationale bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie een uitnodiging tot herstel kan doen uitgaan, het bureau of de organisatie een dergelijke uitnodiging kan doen uitgaan naast, of in plaats van, het onder i of ii bedoelde.  

f. Wanneer het verstrekken van een origineel van een document niet vereist is ingevolge paragraaf d, maar het nationale bureau of de intergouvernementele organisatie het noodzakelijk acht het origineel van genoemd document te ontvangen, kan het of zij een uitnodiging doen uitgaan als bedoeld in paragraaf e ii.  

g. Indien de aanvrager geen gevolg geeft aan een uitnodiging ingevolge paragraaf e ii of paragraaf f: 

i. wordt, wanneer het desbetreffende document de internationale aanvrage is, de internationale aanvrage als ingetrokken beschouwd en geeft het ontvangende bureau een hiertoe strekkende verklaring af;  

ii. wordt, wanneer het desbetreffende document volgt op de internationale aanvrage, het document als niet ingediend beschouwd.    

h. Een nationaal bureau of intergouvernementele organisatie is niet verplicht een document dat wordt toegezonden via een in paragraaf a bedoeld communicatiemiddel in ontvangst te nemen, tenzij het of zij het Internationale Bureau te kennen heeft gegeven dat het of zij bereid is een dergelijk document in ontvangst te nemen via dat communicatiemiddel en het Internationale Bureau informatie hierover heeft gepubliceerd in het mededelingenblad.
