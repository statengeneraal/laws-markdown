#### *Special Missions* 

Resolution adopted at the 4th plenary meeting on April 10, 1961  *The United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities,*  *Recalling* that the General Assembly of the United Nations, by its resolution 1504 (XV) of 12 December 1960, referred to the Conference the draft articles on special missions contained in chapter III of the Report of the International Law Commission covering the Work of its Twelfth Session, *Recognizing* the importance of the subject of special missions, *Taking note* of the comments of the International Law Commission that the draft articles on special missions constituted only a preliminary survey and that the time at its disposal had not permitted the Commission to undertake a thorough study of the matter, *Considering* the limited time available to the Conference to study the subject in full, *Recommends* to the General Assembly of the United Nations that it refer to the International Law Commission further study of the subject of special missions in the light of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations adopted at the present Conference.  

### II  

#### *Consideration of Civil Claims* 

Resolution adopted at the 12th plenary meeting on April 14, 1961  *The United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities,*  *Taking note* that the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations adopted by the Conference provides for immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving State of members of the diplomatic mission of the sending State, *Recalling* that such immunity may be waived by the sending State, *Recalling further* the statement made in the Preamble to the Convention that the purpose of such immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions, *Mindful* of the deep concern expressed during the deliberations of the Conference that claims of diplomatic immunity might, in certain cases, deprive persons in the receiving State of remedies to which they are entitled by law, *Recommends* that the sending State should waive the immunity of members of its diplomatic mission in respect of civil claims of persons in the receiving State when this can be done without impeding the performance of the functions of the mission, and that, when immunity is not waived, the sending State should use its best endeavours to bring about a just settlement of the claims.

4.  De immuniteit van een diplomatieke ambtenaar ten aanzien van de rechtsmacht van de ontvangende staat verleent hem geen immuniteit ten aanzien van die rechtsmacht van de zendstaat.

4.  Het afstand doen van immuniteit van rechtsmacht ten aanzien van burger- of administratiefrechtelijke procedures wordt niet geacht in te houden het afstand doen van immuniteit ten aanzien van de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis; hiervoor is een afzonderlijk afstand doen van immuniteit noodzakelijk.   

### Artikel  33  

1.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van lid 3 van dit artikel is een diplomatieke ambtenaar ten aanzien van voor de zendstaat verrichte diensten vrijgesteld van de eventueel in de ontvangende staat van kracht zijnde voorschriften op het terrein van de sociale verzekering.

3.  Een diplomatieke ambtenaar die personen in dienst heeft waarop de in lid 2 van dit artikel bedoelde vrijstelling niet van toepassing is, dient de verplichtingen in acht te nemen, die de voorschriften op het terrein van de sociale verzekering van de ontvangende staat aan werkgevers opleggen.   
4.  De in de leden 1 en 2 van dit artikel bedoelde vrijstelling sluit vrijwillige deelneming aan het stelsel van sociale verzekering van de ontvangende staat niet uit, mits deze staat deze deelneming toestaat.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel hebben geen invloed op reeds eerder gesloten bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten inzake sociale verzekering en staan het sluiten van dergelijke overeenkomsten in de toekomst niet in de weg.

De persoonlijke bagage van een diplomatieke ambtenaar is vrijgesteld van onderzoek, tenzij er ernstige redenen zijn om te veronderstellen dat zij goederen bevat, die niet vallen onder de in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde vrijstellingen of goederen waarvan de in- of uitvoer verboden is door de wet of onderworpen is aan quarantainebepalingen van de ontvangende staat. Onderzoek mag slechts plaats vinden in aanwezigheid van de diplomatieke ambtenaar of van een persoon die gemachtigd is hem te vertegenwoordigen.   

### Artikel  37

2.  Leden van het administratieve en technische personeel van de zending, alsmede inwonende gezinsleden, genieten, indien zij geen onderdaan zijn van, of niet duurzaam verblijf houden in, de ontvangende staat, de in de artikelen 29 t/m 35 omschreven voorrechten en immuniteiten, met dien verstande dat de immuniteit van de burger- en administratiefrechtelijke bevoegdheid van de ontvangende staat omschreven in lid 1 van artikel 31 zich niet uitstrekt tot handelingen die geen ambtshandelingen zijn. Zij genieten voorts de in artikel 36, lid 1, omschreven voorrechten met betrekking tot goederen die worden ingevoerd ten tijde dat zij zich voor het eerst inrichten.

In andere opzichten genieten zij slechts voorrechten en immuniteiten voorzover de ontvangende staat dit toestaat. De ontvangende staat moet zijn rechtsmacht over deze personen evenwel uitoefenen op een wijze die de uitoefening van de functies van de zending niet onnodig bemoeilijkt.   

### Artikel  38  

1.  Behalve voorzover een ontvangende staat aanvullende voorrechten en immuniteiten verleent, geniet een diplomatieke ambtenaar die onderdaan is van, of duurzaam verblijf houdt in, die staat slechts immuniteit van rechtsmacht en onschendbaarheid ten aanzien van officiële handelingen verricht in de uitoefening van zijn functie.   
2.  Andere personeelsleden van de zending en particuliere bedienden die onderdaan zijn van, of duurzaam verblijf houden in, de ontvangende staat genieten slechts voorrechten en immuniteiten voorzover deze door de ontvangende staat zijn toegestaan. De ontvangende staat moet zijn rechtsmacht over deze personen evenwel uitoefenen op een wijze die de uitoefening van de functies van de zending niet onnodig bemoeilijkt.   

### Artikel  39  

1.  Een ieder die recht heeft op voorrechten en immuniteiten geniet deze vanaf het ogenblik waarop hij het grondgebied van de ontvangende staat betreedt om zijn functie te aanvaarden, of, indien hij zich reeds op het grondgebied van die staat bevindt, vanaf het ogenblik waarop kennisgeving van zijn aanstelling wordt gedaan aan het ministerie van buitenlandse zaken of aan een ander overeengekomen ministerie.   
2.  Wanneer de taak van een persoon die voorrechten en immuniteiten geniet is beëindigd, houden deze voorrechten en immuniteiten als regel op te bestaan op het ogenblik waarop hij het land verlaat, of na het verstrijken van een redelijke termijn om het land te verlaten, doch zij blijven tot aan dat tijdstip van kracht, zelfs in geval van een gewapend conflict. Met betrekking tot door zulk een persoon in de uitoefening van zijn functie als lid van de zending verrichte handelingen blijft de immuniteit evenwel van kracht.

Successierechten worden niet geheven op roerende goederen waarvan de aanwezigheid in de ontvangende staat uitsluitend het gevolg was van de aanwezigheid aldaar van de overledene als lid van de zending of als gezinslid van een lid van de zending.

Hetzelfde geldt voor leden van zijn gezin die voorrechten en immuniteiten genieten en die de (diplomatieke ambtenaar vergezellen of afzonderlijk reizen om zich bij hem te voegen of naar hun land terug te keren.   
2.  In omstandigheden die van dezelfde aard zijn als die omschreven in lid 1 van dit artikel, belemmeren derde staten niet de doorreis door hun grondgebied van leden van het administratieve en technische of het bedienende personeel van een zending, en van hun gezinsleden.

### Artikel  41  

1.  Ongeacht hun voorrechten en immuniteiten is het die plicht van alle personen die deze voorrechten en immuniteiten genieten de wetten en regelingen van de ontvangende staat te eerbiedigen. Zij hebben ook de plicht zich niet in te laten met de binnenlandse aangelegenheden van die staat.

### Artikel  45  

Indien de diplomatieke betrekkingen tussen twee staten worden verbroken of indien een zending voorgoed of tijdelijk wordt teruggeroepen:

### Artikel  47  

1.  Bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag maakt de ontvangende staat geen onderscheid tussen de staten.   
2.  Onderscheid wordt evenwel niet geacht te zijn gemaakt: 

(a) indien de ontvangende staat enigerlei bepaling van dit Verdrag op beperkte wijze toepast omdat die bepaling op zijn zending in de zendstaat beperkt wordt toegepast;
