(b) it has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the entry into force of the treaty and provided that such entry into force is not unduly delayed.    

### SECTION  2  

####RESERVATIONS

### Article  19  

####Formulation of reservations

A State may, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, formulate a reservation unless: 

(a) the reservation is prohibited by the treaty;  

(b) the treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservation in question, may be made; or  

(c) in cases not falling under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.    

### Article  20  

####Acceptance of and objection to reservations

1.  A reservation expressly authorized by a treaty does not require any subsequent acceptance by the other contracting States unless the treaty so provides.   
2.  When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating States and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.   
3.  When a treaty is a constituent instrument of an international organization and unless it otherwise provides, a reservation requires the acceptance of the competent organ of that organization.   
4.  In cases not falling under the preceding paragraphs and unless the treaty otherwise provides: 

(a) acceptance by another contracting State of a reservation constitutes the reserving State a party to the treaty in relation to that other State if or when the treaty is in force for those States;  

(b) an objection by another contracting State to a reservation does not preclude the entry into force of the treaty as between the objecting and reserving States unless a contrary intention is definitely expressed by the objecting State;  

(c) an act expressing a State's consent to be bound by the treaty and containing a reservation is effective as soon as at least one other contracting State has accepted the reservation.     
5.  For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 4 and unless the treaty otherwise provides, a reservation is considered to have been accepted by a State if it shall have raised no objection to the reservation by the end of a period of twelve months after it was notified of the reservation or by the date on which it expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, whichever is later.   

### Article  21  

####Legal effects of reservations and of objections to reservations

1.  A reservation established with regard to another party in accordance with articles 19, 20 and 23: 

(a) modifies for the reserving State in its relations with that other party the provisions of the treaty to which the reservation relates to the extent of the reservation; and  

(b) modifies those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the reserving State.     
2.  The reservation does not modify the provisions of the treaty for the other parties to the treaty *inter se.*   
3.  When a State objecting to a reservation has not opposed the entry into force of the treaty between itself and the reserving State, the provisions to which the reservation relates do not apply as between the two States to the extent of the reservation.   

### Article  22  

####Withdrawal of reservations and of objections to reservations

1.  Unless the treaty otherwise provides, a reservation may be withdrawn at any time and the consent of a State which has accepted the reservation is not required for its withdrawal.   
2.  Unless the treaty otherwise provides, an objection to a reservation may be withdrawn at any time.   
3.  Unless the treaty otherwise provides, or it is otherwise agreed: 

(a) the withdrawal of a reservation becomes operative in relation to another contracting State only when notice of it has been received by that State;  

(b) the withdrawal of an objection to a reservation becomes operative only when notice of it has been received by the State which formulated the reservation.     

### Article  23  

####Procedure regarding reservations

1.  A reservation, an express acceptance of a reservation and an objection to a reservation must be formulated in writing and communicated to the contracting States and other States entitled to become parties to the treaty.   
2.  If formulated when signing the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, a reservation must be formally confirmed by the reserving State when expressing its consent to be bound by the treaty. In such a case the reservation shall be considered as having been made on the date of its confirmation.   
3.  An express acceptance of, or an objection to, a reservation made previously to confirmation of the reservation does not itself require confirmation.   
4.  The withdrawal of a reservation or of an objection to a reservation must be formulated in writing.   

### SECTION  3  

####ENTRY INTO FORCE AND PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF TREATIES

### Article  24  

####Entry into force

1.  A treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide or as the negotiating States may agree.   
2.  Failing any such provision or agreement, a treaty enters into force as soon as consent to be bound by the treaty has been established for all the negotiating States.   
3.  When the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is established on a date after the treaty has come into force, the treaty enters into force for that State on that date, unless the treaty otherwise provides.   
4.  The provisions of a treaty regulating the authentication of its text, the establishment of the consent of States to be bound by the treaty, the manner or date of its entry into force, reservations, the functions of the depositary and other matters arising necessarily before the entry into force of the treaty apply from the time of the adoption of its text.   

### Article  25  

####Provisional application

1.  A treaty or a part of a treaty is applied provisionally pending its entry into force if: 

(a) the treaty itself so provides; or  

(b) the negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.     
2.  Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise agreed, the provisional application of a treaty or a part of a treaty with respect to a State shall be terminated if that State notifies the other States between which the treaty is being applied provisionally of its intention not to become a party to the treaty.   

### PART  III  

####Observance, application and interpretation of treaties

### SECTION  1  

####OBSERVANCE OF TREATIES

### Article  26  

####Pacta sunt servanda

Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.  

### Article  27  

####Internal law and observance of treaties

A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.  

### SECTION  2  

####APPLICATION OF TREATIES

### Article  28  

####Non-retroactivity of treaties

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.  

### Article  29  

####Territorial scope of treaties

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.  

### Article  30  

####Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter

1.  Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.   
2.  When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.   
3.  When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.   
4.  When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one: 

(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;  

(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.     
5.  Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 or to any question of responsibility which may arise for a State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the provisions of which are incompatible with its obligations towards another State under another treaty.   

### SECTION  3  

####INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES

### Article  31  

####General rule of interpretation

1.  A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.   
2.  The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: 

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;  

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.     
3.  There shall be taken into account, together with the context: 

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;  

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;  

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.     
4.  A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.   

### Article  32  

####Supplementary means of interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: 

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or  

(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.    

### Article  33  

####Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages

1.  When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.   
2.  A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.   
3.  The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.   
4.  Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.   

### SECTION  4  

####TREATIES AND THIRD STATES

### Article  34  

####General rule regarding third States

A treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.  

### Article  35  

####Treaties providing for obligations for third States

An obligation arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to be the means of establishing the obligation and the third State expressly accepts that obligation in writing.  

### Article  36  

####Treaties providing for rights for third States

1.  A right arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to accord that right either to the third State, or to a group of States to which it belongs, or to all States, and the third State assents thereto. Its assent shall be presumed so long as the contrary is not indicated, unless the treaty otherwise provides.   
2.  A State exercising a right in accordance with paragraph 1 shall comply with the conditions for its exercise provided for in the treaty or established in conformity with the treaty.   

### Article  37  

####Revocation or modification of obligations or rights of third States

1.  When an obligation has arisen for a third State in conformity with article 35, the obligation may be revoked or modified only with the consent of the parties to the treaty and of the third State, unless it is established that they had otherwise agreed.   
2.  When a right has arisen for a third State in conformity with article 36, the right may not be revoked or modified by the parties if it is established that the right was intended not to be revocable or subject to modification without the consent of the third State.   

### Article  38  

####Rules in a treaty becoming binding on third States through international custom

Nothing in articles 34 to 37 precludes a rule set forth in a treaty from becoming binding upon a third State as a customary rule of international law, recognized as such.  

### PART  IV  

####Amendment and modification of treaties

### Article  39  

####General rule regarding the amendment of treaties

A treaty may be amended by agreement between the parties. The rules laid down in Part II apply to such an agreement except in so far as the treaty may otherwise provide.  

### Article  40  

####Amendment of multilateral treaties

1.  Unless the treaty otherwise provides, the amendment of multilateral treaties shall be governed by the following paragraphs.   
2.  Any proposal to amend a multilateral treaty as between all the parties must be notified to all the contracting States, each one of which shall have the right to take part in: 

(a) the decision as to the action to be taken in regard to such proposal;  

(b) the negotiation and conclusion of any agreement for the amendment of the treaty.     
3.  Every State entitled to become a party to the treaty shall also be entitled to become a party to the treaty as amended.   
4.  The amending agreement does not bind any State already a party to the treaty which does not become a party to the amending agreement; article 30, paragraph 4(b), applies in relation to such State.   
5.  Any State which becomes a party to the treaty after the entry into force of the amending agreement shall, failing an expression of a different intention by that State: 

(a) be considered as a party to the treaty as amended; and  

(b) be considered as a party to the unamended treaty in relation to any party to the treaty not bound by the amending agreement.     

### Article  41  

####Agreements to modify multilateral treaties between certain of the parties only

1.  Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if: 

(a) the possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or  

(b) the modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and: 

(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;  

(ii) does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.       
2.  Unless in a case falling under paragraph l(a) the treaty otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it provides.   

### PART  V  

####Invalidity, termination and suspension of the operation of treaties

### SECTION  1  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  42  

####Validity and continuance in force of treaties

1.  The validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention.   
2.  The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of a party, may take place only as a result of the application of the provisions of the treaty or of the present Convention. The same rule applies to suspension of the operation of a treaty.   

### Article  43  

####Obligations imposed by international law independently of a treaty

The invalidity, termination or denunciation of a treaty, the withdrawal of a party from it, or the suspension of its operation, as a result of the application of the present Convention or of the provisions of the treaty, shall not in any way impair the duty of any State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would be subject under international law independently of the treaty.  

### Article  44  

####Separability of treaty provisions

1.  A right of a party, provided for in a treaty or arising under article 56, to denounce, withdraw from or suspend the operation of the treaty may be exercised only with respect to the whole treaty unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree,   
2.  A ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty recognized in the present Convention may be invoked only with respect to the whole treaty except as provided in the following paragraphs or in article 60.   
3.  If the ground relates solely to particular clauses, it may be invoked only with respect to those clauses where: 

(a) the said clauses are separable from the remainder of the treaty with regard to their application;  

(b) it appears from the treaty or is otherwise established that acceptance of those clauses was not an essential basis of the consent of the other party or parties to be bound by the treaty as a whole; and  

(c) continued performance of the remainder of the treaty would not be unjust.     
4.  In cases falling under articles 49 and 50 the State entitled to invoke the fraud or corruption may do so with respect either to the whole treaty or, subject to paragraph 3, to the particular clauses alone.   
5.  In cases falling under articles 51, 52 and 53, no separation of the provisions of the treaty is permitted.   

### Article  45  

####Loss of a right to invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty

A State may no longer invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty under articles 46 to 50 or articles 60 and 62 if, after becoming aware of the facts: 

(a) it shall have expressly agreed that the treaty is valid or remains in force or continues in operation, as the case may be; or  

(b) it must by reason of its conduct be considered as having acquiesced in the validity of the treaty or in its maintenance in force or in operation, as the case may be.    

### SECTION  2  

####INVALIDITY OF TREATIES

### Article  46  

####Provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties

1.  A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.   
2.  A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.   

### Article  47  

####Specific restrictions on authority to express the consent of a State

If the authority of a representative to express the consent of a State to be bound by a particular treaty has been made subject to a specific restriction, his omission to observe that restriction may not be invoked as invalidating the consent expressed by him unless the restriction was notified to the other negotiating States prior to his expressing such consent.  

### Article  48  

####Error

1.  A State may invoke an error in a treaty as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty if the error relates to a fact or situation which was assumed by that State to exist at the time when the treaty was concluded and formed an essential basis of its consent to be bound by the treaty.   
2.  Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the State in question contributed by its own conduct to the error or if the circumstances were such as to put that State on notice of a possible error.   
3.  An error relating only to the wording of the text of a treaty does not affect its validity; article 79 then applies.   

### Article  49  

####Fraud

If a State has been induced to conclude a treaty by the fraudulent conduct of another negotiating State, the State may invoke the fraud as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty.  

### Article  50  

####Corruption of a representative of a State

If the expression of a State's consent to be bound by a treaty has been procured through the corruption of its representative directly or indirectly by another negotiating State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty.  

### Article  51  

####Coercion of a representative of a State

The expression of a State's consent to be bound by a treaty which has been procured by the coercion of its representative through acts or threats directed against him shall be without any legal effect.  

### Article  52  

####Coercion of a State by the threat or use of force

A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.  

### Article  53  

####Treaties conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law (jus cogens)

A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.

(b) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting States.    

### Article  55  

####Reduction of the parties to a multilateral treaty below the number necessary for its entry into force

### Article  56  

####Denunciation of or withdrawal from a treaty containing no provision regarding termination, denunciation or withdrawal

1.  A treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which does not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless: 

(a) it is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal; or  

(b) a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty.     
2.  A party shall give not less than twelve months' notice of its intention to denounce or withdraw from a treaty under paragraph 1.

### Article  58  

####Suspension of the operation of a multilateral treaty by agreement between certain of the parties only

1.  Two or more parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to suspend the operation of provisions of the treaty, temporarily and as between themselves alone, if: 

(a) the possibility of such a suspension is provided for by the treaty; or  

(b) the suspension in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

2.  Unless in a case falling under paragraph l(a) the treaty otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of those provisions of the treaty the operation of which they intend to suspend.   

### Article  59  

####Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty

1.  A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject-matter and: 

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or  

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.     
2.  The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of the parties.   

### Article  60  

####Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty as a consequence of its breach

1.  A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.   
2.  A material breach of a multilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles: 

(a) the other parties by unanimous agreement to suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part or to terminate it either: 

(i) in the relations between themselves and the defaulting State, or  

(ii) as between all the parties;    

(b) a party specially affected by the breach to invoke it as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part in the relations between itself and the defaulting State;  

(c) any party other than the defaulting State to invoke the breach as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part with respect to itself if the treaty is of such a character that a material breach of its provisions by one party radically changes the position of every party with respect to the further performance of its obligations under the treaty.     
3.  A material breach of a treaty, for the purposes of this article, consists in: 

(a) a repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the present Convention; or

### Article  61  

####Supervening impossibility of performance

1.  A party may invoke the impossibility of performing a treaty as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from it if the impossibility results from the permanent disappearance or destruction of an object indispensable for the execution of the treaty. If the impossibility is temporary, it may be invoked only as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty.   
2.  Impossiblity of performance may not be invoked by a party as a ground for terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty if the impossibility is the result of a breach by that party either of an obligation under the treaty or of any other international obligation owed to any other party to the treaty.   

### Article  62  

####Fundamental change of circumstances

1.  A fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty unless: 

(a) the existence of those circumstances constituted an essential basis of the consent of the parties to be bound by the treaty; and  

(b) the effect of the change is radically to transform the extent of obligations still to be performed under the treaty.     
2.  A fundamental change of circumstances may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from a treaty: 

(a) if the treaty establishes a boundary; or  

(b) if the fundamental change is the result of a breach by the party invoking it either of an obligation under the treaty or of any other international obligation owed to any other party to the treaty.     
3.  If, under the foregoing paragraphs, a party may invoke a fundamental change of circumstances as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from a treaty it may also invoke the change as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty.   

### Article  63  

####Severance of diplomatic or consular relations

4.  In the case of the invalidity of a particular State's consent to be bound by a multilateral treaty, the foregoing rules apply in the relations between that State and the parties to the treaty.

####Consequences of the invalidity of a treaty which conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law

2.  In the case of a treaty which becomes void and terminates under article 64, the termination of the treaty: 

(a) releases the parties from any obligation further to perform the treaty;  

(b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination; provided that those rights, obligations or situations may thereafter be maintained only to the extent that their maintenance is not in itself in conflict with the new peremptory norm of general international law.

### Article  74  

####Diplomatic and consular relations and the conclusion of treaties

### Article  75  

####Case of an aggressor State

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, In overweging nemend de fundamentele rol van verdragen in de geschiedenis van de internationale betrekkingen, Zich bewust van het steeds toenemend belang van verdragen als bron van volkenrecht en als middel ter ontwikkeling van de vreedzame samenwerking tussen de naties, ongeacht hun constitutionele en sociale stelsels, Vaststellend dat de beginselen van vrijwillige instemming en van goede trouw en de regel *pacta sunt servanda* algemeen erkend worden, Bevestigend dat geschillen betreffende verdragen, evenals andere internationale geschillen, dienen te worden geregeld langs vreedzame weg en overeenkomstig de beginselen van gerechtigheid en het volkenrecht, Herinnerend aan de vastbeslotenheid van de volken van de Verenigde Naties tot het scheppen van de voorwaarden die noodzakelijk zijn voor het handhaven van de gerechtigheid en de eerbiediging van de uit verdragen voortvloeiende verplichtingen, Indachtig de beginselen van het volkenrecht, neergelegd in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties, als daar zijn de beginselen van de gelijkgerechtigdheid der volken en hun recht op zelfbeschikking, de soevereine gelijkheid en de onafhankelijkheid van alle Staten, het zich niet mengen in binnenlandse aangelegenheden van Staten, het verbod van het dreigen met of het gebruikmaken van geweld en de universele en daadwerkelijke eerbied voor de rechten van de mens en fundamentele vrijheden voor allen, Van oordeel zijnde dat de codificatie en de geleidelijke ontwikkeling van het in dit Verdrag neergelegde verdragenrecht de in het Handvest omschreven doelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties zullen bevorderen, te weten: het handhaven van de internationale vrede en veiligheid, het ontwikkelen van vriendschappelijke betrekkingen tussen de naties en de verwezenlijking van de internationale samenwerking, Bevestigend dat de vraagstukken die niet door de bepalingen van dit Verdrag worden geregeld, zullen worden beheerst door de regels van het internationale gewoonterecht,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:

####VOORBEHOUDEN

### Artikel  19  

####Het maken van voorbehouden

Een Staat kan op het ogenblik van ondertekening, bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van een verdrag of toetreding tot een verdrag een voorbehoud maken, tenzij: 

a) dit voorbehoud is verboden door het verdrag;  

b) het verdrag bepaalt dat slechts bepaalde voorbehouden, waaronder niet het voorbehoud in kwestie, kunnen worden gemaakt; of  

c) voor zover het andere gevallen dan omschreven onder a) en b) betreft, het voorbehoud niet verenigbaar is met voorwerp en doel van het verdrag.    

### Artikel  20  

####Aanvaarding van en bezwaar tegen voorbehouden

1.  Een door een verdrag uitdrukkelijk toegestaan voorbehoud behoeft niet nadien door de andere verdragsluitende partijen te worden aanvaard, tenzij het verdrag dat voorschrijft.   
2.  Indien uit het beperkte aantal Staten dat aan de onderhandelingen heeft deelgenomen en uit het voorwerp en doel van het verdrag blijkt, dat de toepassing van het verdrag in zijn geheel tussen alle partijen een wezenlijke voorwaarde is voor de instemming van elk hunner door het verdrag gebonden te worden, dient een voorbehoud door alle partijen te worden aanvaard.   
3.  Indien een verdrag een oprichtingsakte van een internationale organisatie is en indien het niet anders bepaalt, dient een voorbehoud door het bevoegde orgaan van deze organisatie te worden aanvaard.   
4.  In andere gevallen dan die waarin de voorgaande leden voorzien en indien het verdrag niet anders bepaalt: 

a) maakt de aanvaarding van een voorbehoud door een andere verdragsluitende Staat de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt partij bij het verdrag met betrekking tot deze andere Staat, indien het verdrag in werking is of wanneer het in werking treedt voor deze Staten;  

b) verhindert het bezwaar van een andere verdragsluitende Staat tegen een voorbehoud niet de inwerkingtreding van het verdrag tussen de Staat die het bezwaar heeft aangetekend en de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt, tenzij de tegengestelde bedoeling duidelijk is uitgedrukt door de Staat die het bezwaar heeft aangetekend;  

c) wordt een akte, waarin de instemming van een Staat door het verdrag gebonden te worden tot uitdrukking wordt gebracht en die een voorbehoud bevat, van kracht zodra ten minste één andere verdragsluitende Staat het voorbehoud heeft aanvaard.     
5.  Voor de toepassing van het tweede en vierde lid en indien het verdrag niet anders bepaalt, wordt een voorbehoud geacht te zijn aanvaard door een Staat, indien deze geen bezwaar heeft gemaakt tegen het voorbehoud binnen twaalf maanden na de datum waarop hij de kennisgeving daarvan ontvangen heeft, of op de dag, waarop hij zijn instemming door het verdrag gebonden te worden tot uitdrukking heeft gebracht indien deze dag op een latere datum valt.   

### Artikel  21  

####Rechtsgevolgen van voorbehouden en bezwaren tegen voorbehouden

1.  Een voorbehoud, gemaakt ten aanzien van een andere partij overeenkomstig de artikelen 19, 20 en 23: 

a) wijzigt voor de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt in zijn betrekkingen met deze andere partij de bepalingen van het verdrag waarop het voorbehoud betrekking heeft, in de mate voorzien in dit voorbehoud; en  

b) wijzigt deze bepalingen in dezelfde mate voor deze andere partij in haar betrekkingen met de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt.     
2.  Het voorbehoud wijzigt niet de bepalingen van het verdrag voor de andere partijen bij het verdrag *inter se.*   
3.  Indien een Staat die bezwaar heeft gemaakt tegen een voorbehoud zich niet heeft verzet tegen de inwerkingtreding van het verdrag tussen hem en de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt, zijn de bepalingen waarop het voorbehoud betrekking heeft niet van toepassing tussen de beide Staten in de mate voorzien in het voorbehoud.   

### Artikel  22  

####Het intrekken van voorbehouden en bezwaren tegen voorbehouden

1.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt, kan een voorbehoud elk ogenblik worden ingetrokken zonder dat daarvoor de instemming nodig is van de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft aanvaard.   
2.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt, kan een bezwaar tegen een voorbehoud te allen tijde worden ingetrokken.   
3.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt of indien anders is overeengekomen: 

a) wordt het intrekken van een voorbehoud eerst ten aanzien van een andere verdragsluitende Staat van kracht wanneer die Staat een kennisgeving dienaangaande heeft ontvangen;  

b) wordt het intrekken van een bezwaar tegen een voorbehoud pas van kracht wanneer de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt een kennisgeving van de intrekking heeft ontvangen.     

### Artikel  23  

####Procedure betreffende voorbehouden

1.  Een voorbehoud, een uitdrukkelijke aanvaarding van een voorbehoud en een bezwaar tegen een voorbehoud moeten schriftelijk worden vastgelegd en aan de verdragsluitende Staten en aan andere Staten die gerechtigd zijn partij bij het verdrag te worden, worden medegedeeld.   
2.  Indien een voorbehoud wordt gemaakt bij de ondertekening van het verdrag onder voorbehoud van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring, moet het formeel bevestigd worden door de Staat die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt op het ogenblik dat hij zijn instemming door het verdrag gebonden te worden, tot uitdrukking brengt. In een dergelijk geval zal het voorbehoud worden beschouwd als te zijn gemaakt op de dag van bevestiging.   
3.  Een uitdrukkelijke aanvaarding van een voorbehoud of een bezwaar tegen een voorbehoud behoeft, indien voorafgegaan aan een bevestiging van dat voorbehoud, zelf niet te worden bevestigd.   
4.  Het intrekken van een voorbehoud of een bezwaar tegen een voorbehoud dient schriftelijk te geschieden.   

### AFDELING  3  

####INWERKINGTREDING VAN VERDRAGEN EN VOORLOPIGE TOEPASSING

### Artikel  24  

####Inwerkingtreding

1.  Een verdrag treedt in werking op de wijze en op de dag zoals voorzien in zijn bepalingen, of krachtens overeenstemming tussen de Staten die hebben deelgenomen aan de onderhandelingen.   
2.  Indien dergelijke bepalingen of een dergelijke overeenstemming ontbreken, treedt een verdrag in werking zodra de instemming door het verdrag gebonden te worden, vaststaat voor alle Staten die hebben deelgenomen aan de onderhandelingen.   
3.  Indien de instemming van een Staat door een verdrag gebonden te worden tot uitdrukking wordt gebracht op een datum na de inwerkingtreding van dit verdrag treedt het in werking voor deze Staat op deze datum, tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt.   
4.  De bepalingen van een verdrag, die de authentificatie van de tekst, het tot uitdrukking brengen van de instemming van de Staten door het verdrag gebonden te worden, de wijze of de datum van inwerkingtreding, de voorbehouden, de werkzaamheden van de depositaris, alsmede de andere vraagstukken die zich noodzakelijkerwijze voordoen voor de inwerkingtreding van het verdrag regelen, zijn van toepassing vanaf het tijdstip van de aanneming van de tekst.   

### Artikel  25  

####Voorlopige toepassing

1.  Een verdrag of een deel van een verdrag wordt voorlopig toegepast in afwachting van zijn inwerkingtreding, indien 

a) het verdrag zulks bepaalt; of  

b) indien de Staten die hebben deelgenomen aan de onderhandelingen op een andere wijze aldus zijn overeengekomen.     
2.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt of de Staten die aan de onderhandelingen hebben deelgenomen anders zijn overeengekomen, houdt de voorlopige toepassing van een verdrag of een deel van een verdrag voor een Staat op, als deze Staat de andere Staten waartussen het verdrag voorlopig wordt toegepast, in kennis stelt van zijn voornemen geen partij te worden bij het verdrag.

Een partij mag zich niet beroepen op de bepalingen van zijn nationale recht om het niet ten uitvoer leggen van een verdrag te rechtvaardigen. Deze regel geldt onverminderd artikel 46.  

### AFDELING  2  

####TOEPASSING VAN VERDRAGEN

### Artikel  28  

####Niet-terugwerkende kracht van verdragen

Tenzij uit het verdrag of op andere wijze een andere bedoeling blijkt, binden de bepalingen van een verdrag een partij niet met betrekking tot een handeling of feit, voorafgaand aan de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit verdrag voor deze partij, of enige situatie die op die datum niet meer bestond.  

### Artikel  29  

####Territoriale gelding van verdragen

Tenzij een andere bedoeling uit het verdrag blijkt of op een andere wijze is komen vast te staan, bindt een verdrag elke partij ten opzichte van haar gehele grondgebied.  

### Artikel  30  

####Toepassing van achtereenvolgende verdragen die betrekking hebben op eenzelfde onderwerp

1.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van artikel 103 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties worden de rechten en verplichtingen van Staten die partij zijn bij achtereenvolgende verdragen die betrekking hebben op eenzelfde onderwerp bepaald overeenkomstig de volgende leden.   
2.  Indien een verdrag uitdrukkelijk vermeldt dat het ondergeschikt is aan een eerder of later verdrag of dat het niet als onverenigbaar met dit andere verdrag moet worden beschouwd, hebben de bepalingen van dat andere verdrag voorrang.   
3.  Indien alle partijen bij het eerdere verdrag eveneens partij zijn bij het latere verdrag, zonder dat het eerdere verdrag beëindigd is of zijn werking is opgeschort krachtens artikel 59, is het eerdere verdrag slechts van toepassing in de mate waarin zijn bepalingen verenigbaar zijn met die van het latere verdrag.   
4.  Indien de partijen bij het eerdere verdrag niet alle partij zijn bij het latere verdrag: 

a) is in de betrekkingen tussen Staten die partij zijn bij beide verdragen de regel van toepassing die in het derde lid is vastgelegd;  

b) regelt in de betrekkingen tussen een Staat die partij is bij beide verdragen en een Staat die slechts partij is bij een van deze verdragen het verdrag waarbij beide Staten partij zijn hun wederzijdse rechten en verplichtingen.     
5.  Het vierde lid is van toepassing onverminderd artikel 41 of enig vraagstuk aangaande de beëindiging of de opschorting van de werking van een verdrag op grond van artikel 60 of enig vraagstuk aangaande verantwoordelijkheid die voor een Staat kan ontstaan uit het sluiten of de toepassing van een verdrag waarvan de bepalingen onverenigbaar zijn met de verplichtingen die op hem rusten ten aanzien van een andere Staat krachtens een ander verdrag.   

### AFDELING  3  

####UITLEGGING VAN VERDRAGEN

### Artikel  31  

####Algemene regel van uitlegging

1.  Een verdrag moet te goeder trouw worden uitgelegd overeenkomstig de gewone betekenis van de termen van het Verdrag in hun context en in het licht van voorwerp en doel van het Verdrag.   
2.  Voor de uitlegging van een verdrag omvat de context, behalve de tekst, met inbegrip van preambule en bijlagen: 

a) iedere overeenstemming die betrekking heeft op het verdrag en die bij het sluiten van het verdrag tussen alle partijen is bereikt;  

b) iedere akte opgesteld door een of meer partijen bij het sluiten van het verdrag en door de andere partijen erkend als betrekking hebbende op het verdrag.     
3.  Behalve met de context dient ook rekening te worden gehouden met: 

a) iedere later tot stand gekomen overeenstemming tussen de partijen met betrekking tot de uitlegging van het verdrag of de toepassing van zijn bepalingen;  

b) ieder later gebruik in de toepassing van het verdrag waardoor overeenstemming van de partijen inzake de uitlegging van het verdrag is ontstaan;  

c) iedere ter zake dienende regel van het volkenrecht die op de betrekkingen tussen de partijen kan worden toegepast.     
4.  Een term dient in een bijzondere betekenis verstaan te worden als vaststaat, dat dit de bedoeling van de partijen is geweest.   

### Artikel  32  

####Aanvullende middelen van uitlegging

Er kan een beroep worden gedaan op aanvullende middelen van uitlegging en in het bijzonder op de voorbereidende werkzaamheden en de omstandigheden waaronder het verdrag is gesloten, om de betekenis die voortvloeit uit de toepassing van artikel 31 te bevestigen of de betekenis te bepalen indien de uitlegging, geschied overeenkomstig artikel 31: 

a) de betekenis dubbelzinnig of duister laat; of  

b) leidt tot een resultaat dat duidelijk ongerijmd of onredelijk is.    

### Artikel  33  

####Uitlegging van in twee of meer talen geauthentiseerde verdragen

1.  Indien een verdrag geauthentiseerd is in twee of meer talen, heeft de tekst in elk der talen rechtskracht, tenzij het verdrag bepaalt of de partijen overeenkomen dat in geval van verschil een bepaalde tekst moet prevaleren.   
2.  Een versie van het verdrag in een andere taal dan een van de talen waarin de tekst geauthentiseerd is, wordt slechts beschouwd als een authentieke tekst, indien het verdrag daarin voorziet of als de partijen het daarover eens zijn geworden.   
3.  De termen van een verdrag worden geacht dezelfde betekenis te hebben in de onderscheidene authentieke teksten.   
4.  Behalve in het geval dat een bepaalde tekst overeenkomstig het eerste lid prevaleert, dient men, wanneer de vergelijking van de authentieke teksten een verschil in betekenis oplevert dat niet door toepassing van de artikelen 31 en 32 wordt weggenomen, de betekenis aan te nemen die, rekening houdend met het voorwerp en doel van het verdrag deze teksten het best met elkaar verzoent.   

### AFDELING  4  

####VERDRAGEN EN DERDE STATEN

### Artikel  34  

####Algemene regel betreffende derde Staten

Een verdrag schept geen verplichtingen of rechten voor een derde Staat zonder diens instemming.  

### Artikel  35  

####Verdragen die voorzien in verplichtingen voor derde Staten

Voor een derde Staat ontstaat ten gevolge van een bepaling van een verdrag een verplichting, indien de partijen bij het verdrag door middel van deze bepaling de verplichting beogen te scheppen en indien de derde Staat deze verplichting uitdrukkelijk schriftelijk aanvaardt.  

### Artikel  36  

####Verdragen die voorzien in rechten voor derde Staten

1.  Voor een derde Staat ontstaat ten gevolge van een bepaling van een verdrag een recht, indien de partijen bij het verdrag door deze bepaling dit recht willen verlenen aan de derde Staat of aan een groep Staten waartoe hij behoort, of aan alle Staten, en indien de derde Staat daarmede instemt. De instemming wordt geacht te zijn gegeven zolang er geen aanwijzing van het tegendeel bestaat, tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt.   
2.  Een Staat die van een recht, overeenkomstig het eerste lid, gebruik maakt, is voor de uitoefening van dat recht gehouden, de voorwaarden, voorzien in het verdrag of overeenkomstig zijn bepalingen vastgesteld, te eerbiedigen.   

### Artikel  37  

####Herroeping of wijziging van verplichtingen of rechten van derde Staten

1.  Wanneer overeenkomstig artikel 35 een verplichting voor een derde Staat is ontstaan, kan deze verplichting slechts worden herroepen of gewijzigd met instemming van de partijen bij het verdrag en van de derde Staat, tenzij vaststaat dat zij anders zijn overeengekomen.   
2.  Wanneer overeenkomstig artikel 36 een recht voor een derde Staat is ontstaan, kan dit recht niet door de partijen worden herroepen of gewijzigd indien vaststaat, dat het de bedoeling was het recht niet te herroepen of te wijzigen zonder instemming van de derde Staat.   

### Artikel  38  

####Verdragsregels die door internationale gewoonte voor derde Staten bindend worden

Niets in de artikelen 34 tot 37 belet, dat een in een verdrag neergelegde regel bindend wordt voor een derde Staat als een regel van internationaal gewoonterecht, die als zodanig wordt erkend.  

### DEEL  IV  

####Amendering en wijziging van verdragen

### Artikel  39  

####Algemene regel met betrekking tot het amenderen van verdragen

Een verdrag kan bij overeenkomst tussen de partijen worden geamendeerd. Op een dergelijke overeenkomst vinden de regels neergelegd in deel II toepassing behalve in zoverre het verdrag anders bepaalt.  

### Artikel  40  

####Het amenderen van multilaterale verdragen

1.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt, wordt het amenderen van multilaterale verdragen beheerst door de volgende leden:   
2.  Elk voorstel tot amendering van een multilateraal verdrag in de verhoudingen tussen alle partijen moet worden medegedeeld aan alle verdragsluitende Staten, en ieder van hen heeft het recht deel te nemen aan: 

a) de beslissing over hetgeen ten aanzien van dit voorstel moet worden verricht;  

b) de onderhandelingen en het sluiten van elke overeenkomst ter amendering van het verdrag.     
3.  Iedere Staat die gerechtigd is partij te worden bij het verdrag is evenzeer gerechtigd partij te worden bij het aldus geamendeerde verdrag.   
4.  De overeenkomst tot amendering bindt niet de Staten die reeds partij zijn bij het verdrag en die geen partij worden bij deze overeenkomst; artikel 30, vierde lid, letter b) is op deze Staten van toepassing.   
5.  Elke Staat die partij wordt bij een verdrag na de inwerkingtreding van de overeenkomst tot amendering wordt, indien hij geen andere bedoeling heeft kenbaar gemaakt, beschouwd als: 

a) partij bij het verdrag zoals het geamendeerd is; en  

b) partij bij het niet-geamendeerde verdrag met betrekking tot iedere partij bij het verdrag die niet is gebonden door de overeenkomst tot amendering.     

### Artikel  41  

####Overeenkomsten tot wijziging van multilaterale verdragen tussen slechts bepaalde partijen

1.  Twee of meer partijen bij een multilateraal verdrag kunnen een overeenkomst tot wijziging van het verdrag tussen hen onderling slechts sluiten, indien: 

a) het verdrag voorziet in de mogelijkheid van een zodanige wijziging; of  

b) de wijziging in kwestie niet verboden is door het verdrag, en zij 

i) noch het genot der aan de andere partijen op grond van het verdrag toekomende rechten, noch het nakomen van hun verplichtingen aantast; en  

ii) zich niet uitstrekt tot een bepaling, waarvan niet mag worden afgeweken als dit onverenigbaar is met de doeltreffende verwezenlijking van voorwerp en doel van het verdrag in zijn geheel.       
2.  Tenzij in een geval als voorzien in het eerste lid, letter a, het verdrag anders bepaalt, dienen de partijen in kwestie de andere partijen in kennis te stellen van hun voornemen de overeenkomst te sluiten en van de wijzigingen die deze ten gevolge heeft voor het verdrag.   

### DEEL  V  

####Ongeldigheid, beëindiging en opschorting van de werking van verdragen

### AFDELING  1  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  42  

####Geldigheid en het in werking blijven van verdragen

1.  De geldigheid van een verdrag of van de instemming van een Staat door een verdrag gebonden te worden, mag slechts worden betwist door toepassing van dit Verdrag.   
2.  De beëindiging van een verdrag, de opzegging ervan of de terugtrekking van een partij kan slechts plaatsvinden door toepassing van de bepalingen van het verdrag of van dit Verdrag. Dezelfde regel geldt voor de opschorting van de werking van een verdrag.   

### Artikel  43  

####Verplichtingen opgelegd door het internationale recht onafhankelijk van een verdrag

De ongeldigheid, beëindiging of opzegging van een verdrag, de terugtrekking van een partij of de opschorting van de werking van het verdrag ten gevolge van de toepassing van dit Verdrag of van de bepalingen van het verdrag, tast op geen enkele wijze de plicht van een Staat aan tot het nakomen van de verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit het verdrag en waaraan hij krachtens het volkenrecht onafhankelijk van het genoemde verdrag, is onderworpen.  

### Artikel  44  

####Splitsbaarheid van de verdragsbepalingen

1.  Het recht van een partij, voorzien in een verdrag of voortvloeiend uit artikel 56, het verdrag op te zeggen, zich terug te trekken of de werking van het verdrag op te schorten, mag slechts worden uitgeoefend met betrekking tot het verdrag als geheel, tenzij het verdrag anders voorziet of de partijen anders overeenkomen.   
2.  Een grond voor ongeldigheid of beëindiging van een verdrag, voor de terugtrekking van een der partijen of voor opschorting van de werking van het verdrag, die wordt erkend door dit Verdrag, mag slechts worden aangevoerd ten aanzien van het verdrag als geheel, behalve in het geval als voorzien in de volgende leden of in artikel 60.   
3.  Indien de grond slechts op bepaalde clausules betrekking heeft, mag hij slechts worden aangevoerd ten aanzien van die clausules wanneer: 

a) deze clausules scheidbaar zijn van de rest van het verdrag wat hun uitvoering betreft;  

b) uit het verdrag blijkt of op andere wijze vaststaat dat de aanvaarding van deze clausules voor de andere partij of partijen bij het verdrag geen wezenlijke voorwaarde voor de instemming was door het verdrag als geheel gebonden te worden; en  

c) het niet onrechtvaardig zou zijn de uitvoering van de rest van het verdrag voort te zetten.     
4.  In de gevallen vallende onder de artikelen 49 en 50 mag de Staat die het recht heeft zich te beroepen op bedrog of corruptie dit doen ten aanzien van het gehele verdrag of, in het geval bedoeld in het derde lid, slechts ten aanzien van enige bepaalde clausules.   
5.  In de gevallen als voorzien in de artikelen 51, 52 en 53 is geen scheiding tussen de bepalingen van een verdrag toegestaan.   

### Artikel  45  

####Verlies van het recht tot het aanvoeren van gronden voor ongeldigheid of beëindiging van een verdrag of tot terugtrekking uit een verdrag of voor de opschorting van zijn werking

Een Staat mag niet langer gronden aanvoeren tot ongeldigheid of beëindiging van een verdrag of tot terugtrekking uit een verdrag of tot opschorting van de werking ervan krachtens de artikelen 46 tot 50 of de artikelen 60 en 62, als deze Staat, na kennis te hebben genomen van de feiten: 

a) uitdrukkelijk heeft aanvaard dat het verdrag, al naargelang het geval, geldig is, in werking blijft of van toepassing blijft; of  

b) op grond van zijn gedrag moet worden beschouwd als te hebben berust in, al naargelang het geval, de geldigheid van het verdrag of zijn in werking of van toepassing blijven.    

### AFDELING  2  

####ONGELDIGHEID VAN VERDRAGEN

### Artikel  46  

####Bepalingen van het nationale recht met betrekking tot de bevoegdheid tot het sluiten van verdragen

1.  Het feit dat de instemming van een Staat door een verdrag gebonden te worden, is gegeven in strijd met een bepaling van zijn nationale recht betreffende de bevoegdheid tot het sluiten van verdragen, mag door die Staat niet worden aangevoerd ter ongeldigverklaring van die instemming, tenzij die strijdigheid onmiskenbaar was en een regel van fundamenteel belang van het nationale recht van die Staat betrof.   
2.  Een strijdigheid is onmiskenbaar indien zij bij objectieve beschouwing duidelijk is voor iedere Staat die zich ten dezen overeenkomstig het gangbaar gebruik en te goeder trouw gedraagt.   

### Artikel  47  

####Bijzondere beperkingen ten aanzien van de volmacht om de instemming van een Staat tot uitdrukking te brengen

Indien de volmacht van een vertegenwoordiger om de instemming van een Staat door een bepaald verdrag gebonden te worden tot uitdrukking te brengen aan een bijzondere beperking is onderworpen, mag het feit dat deze vertegenwoordiger daarmede geen rekening heeft gehouden niet worden aangevoerd ter ongeldigverklaring van de door hem tot uitdrukking gebrachte instemming, tenzij de beperking aan de andere Staten die hebben deelgenomen aan de onderhandelingen ter kennis was gebracht alvorens de instemming tot uitdrukking werd gebracht.  

### Artikel  48  

####Dwaling

1.  Een Staat mag zich ten einde zijn instemming door een verdrag gebonden te worden ongeldig te verklaren beroepen op een dwaling in het verdrag, indien de dwaling betrekking heeft op een feit of een situatie, door deze Staat beschouwd als te bestaan op het tijdstip van de sluiting van het verdrag en indien dit feit of deze situatie een wezenlijke grond vormde voor de instemming van deze Staat door het verdrag gebonden te worden.   
2.  Het eerste lid is niet van toepassing wanneer bedoelde Staat door zijn gedrag tot deze dwaling heeft bijgedragen of wanneer de omstandigheden van dien aard waren dat hij bedacht had moeten zijn op de mogelijkheid van een dwaling.   
3.  Een dwaling die slechts betrekking heeft op de redactie van de tekst van een verdrag tast de geldigheid ervan niet aan; artikel 79 is in dat geval van toepassing.   

### Artikel  49  

####Bedrog

Indien een Staat er door het bedrieglijke gedrag van een andere Staat die aan de onderhandelingen heeft deelgenomen toe is gebracht een verdrag te sluiten, mag hij het bedrog aanvoeren om zijn instemming door het verdrag gebonden te worden ongeldig te verklaren.  

### Artikel  50  

####Corruptie van een vertegenwoordiger van een Staat

Indien het tot uitdrukking brengen van de instemming van een Staat door een verdrag gebonden te worden, is verkregen door directe of indirecte corruptie van zijn vertegenwoordiger door een andere Staat die aan de onderhandelingen heeft deelgenomen, mag de Staat deze corruptie aanvoeren om zijn instemming door het verdrag gebonden te worden, ongeldig te verklaren.  

### Artikel  51  

####Dwang op de vertegenwoordiger van een Staat uitgeoefend

De instemming van een Staat door een verdrag gebonden te worden, die is verkregen door dwang, uitgeoefend op zijn vertegenwoordiger door middel van tegen hem gerichte handelingen of bedreigingen, heeft geen enkel rechtsgevolg.  

### Artikel  52  

####Dwang, uitgeoefend op een Staat door bedreiging met of gebruik van geweld

Elk verdrag is nietig, waarvan de totstandkoming is bereikt door bedreiging met of gebruik van geweld in strijd met de beginselen van het volkenrecht, neergelegd in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  53  

####Verdragen strijdig met een dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht (jus cogens)

Elk verdrag dat op het tijdstip van zijn totstandkoming in strijd is met een dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht, is nietig. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag is een dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht een norm die aanvaard en erkend is door de internationale gemeenschap van Staten in haar geheel als een norm, waarvan geen afwijking is toegestaan en die slechts kan worden gewijzigd door een latere norm van algemeen volkenrecht van dezelfde aard.  

### AFDELING  3  

####BEËINDIGING VAN VERDRAGEN EN OPSCHORTING VAN DE WERKING VAN VERDRAGEN

### Artikel  54  

####Beëindiging van een verdrag of de terugtrekking uit een verdrag krachtens de bepalingen van het verdrag of door overeenstemming tussen de partijen

Beëindiging van een verdrag of de terugtrekking kan plaatsvinden: 

a) overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het verdrag; of  

b) te allen tijde door overeenstemming tussen alle partijen na raadpleging van de andere verdragsluitende Staten.    

### Artikel  55  

####Vermindering van het aantal partijen bij een multilateraal verdrag tot beneden het voor de inwerkingtreding verplichte aantal

Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt, eindigt een multilateraal verdrag niet uitsluitend doordat het aantal partijen is gedaald tot onder het voor zijn inwerkingtreding vereiste aantal.  

### Artikel  56  

####Opzegging of de terugtrekking uit een verdrag dat geen bepalingen bevat aangaande beëindiging, opzegging of terugtrekking

1.  Bij een verdrag dat geen bepalingen bevat aangaande zijn beëindiging en niet voorziet in opzegging of terugtrekking is opzegging of terugtrekking niet mogelijk, tenzij: 

a) vaststaat, dat de partijen de bedoeling hadden de mogelijkheid van opzegging of terugtrekking toe te laten; of  

b) het recht op opzegging of terugtrekking uit de aard van het verdrag kan worden afgeleid.     
2.  Een partij dient ten minste twaalf maanden tevoren haar voornemen een verdrag op te zeggen of zich uit het verdrag terug te trekken overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het eerste lid kenbaar te maken.   

### Artikel  57  

####Opschorting van de werking van een verdrag krachtens zijn bepalingen of door overeenstemming tussen de partijen

De werking van een verdrag kan ten aanzien van alle partijen of van een bepaalde partij worden opgeschort 

a) overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het verdrag; of  

b) te allen tijde door overeenstemming tussen alle partijen, na raadpleging van de andere verdragsluitende Staten.    

### Artikel  58  

####Opschorting van de werking van een multilateraal verdrag bij overeenkomst tussen slechts bepaalde partijen

1.  Twee of meer partijen bij een multilateraal verdrag kunnen een overeenkomst sluiten om, tijdelijk en uitsluitend tussen hen, de werking van bepalingen van het verdrag op te schorten, indien: 

a) in de mogelijkheid tot een zodanige opschorting in het verdrag is voorzien; of  

b) indien deze opschorting niet is verboden door het verdrag en 

i) noch het genot der aan de andere partijen op grond van het verdrag toekomende rechten, noch het nakomen van hun verplichtingen aantast; en  

ii) niet onverenigbaar is met het voorwerp en doel van het verdrag.       
2.  Tenzij in een geval als bedoeld in het eerste lid, letter a, het verdrag anders bepaalt, dienen de partijen in kwestie de andere partijen in kennis te stellen van hun voornemen de overeenkomst te sluiten en van de bepalingen in het verdrag waarvan zij voornemens zijn de werking op te schorten.   

### Artikel  59  

####Beëindiging van een verdrag of opschorting van de werking van een verdrag ten gevolge van het sluiten van een later verdrag

1.  Een verdrag wordt als beëindigd beschouwd wanneer alle partijen bij dit verdrag een later verdrag sluiten betreffende hetzelfde onderwerp en: 

a) uit het latere verdrag blijkt of anderszins vaststaat dat het de bedoeling van de partijen is de materie door dit verdrag te regelen; of  

b) de bepalingen van het latere verdrag dermate onverenigbaar zijn met die van het eerdere verdrag, dat het onmogelijk is de beide verdragen tegelijkertijd toe te passen.     
2.  Het eerdere verdrag zal geacht worden als alleen maar in zijn werking te zijn opgeschort als uit het latere verdrag blijkt, of op andere wijze vaststaat, dat dit de bedoeling van de partijen was.   

### Artikel  60  

####Beëindiging van een verdrag of opschorting van zijn werking ten gevolge van schending van het verdrag

1.  Een materiële schending van een bilateraal verdrag door een van de partijen geeft de andere partij het recht de schending aan te voeren als grond voor het beëindigen van het verdrag of het geheel of gedeeltelijk opschorten van de werking van het verdrag.   
2.  Een materiële schending van een multilateraal verdrag door een der partijen geeft het recht: 

a) aan de andere partijen bij unanieme overeenstemming de werking van het verdrag in zijn geheel of gedeeltelijk op te schorten of het verdrag te beëindigen: 

i) hetzij in de betrekkingen tussen henzelf en de Staat die het verdrag heeft geschonden,  

ii) hetzij tussen alle partijen;    

b) aan een in het bijzonder door de schending getroffen partij de schending aan te voeren als grond voor het geheel of gedeeltelijk opschorten van de werking van het verdrag in de betrekkingen tussen hemzelf en de Staat die het verdrag heeft geschonden;  

c) aan elke partij, behalve de Staat die het verdrag schendt, deze schending aan te voeren als grond voor het geheel of gedeeltelijk opschorten van de werking van het verdrag, wat haarzelf betreft als dit verdrag van zodanige aard is, dat een materiële schending van zijn bepalingen door een partij de positie van elke partij wat betreft de verdere uitvoering van haar verplichtingen krachtens het verdrag geheel en al wijzigt.     
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel bestaat een materiële schending van een verdrag uit: 

a) een verwerping van het verdrag die niet toegestaan is door dit Verdrag; of  

b) de schending van een bepaling die van wezenlijk belang is voor de uitvoering van het verdrag wat zijn voorwerp of doel betreft.     
4.  De voorgaande leden tasten geen enkele bepaling in het verdrag aan die van toepassing is in geval van schending.   
5.  De leden 1 tot en met 3 zijn niet van toepassing op bepalingen betreffende bescherming van de menselijke persoon, opgenomen in verdragen van humanitaire aard, in het bijzonder bepalingen die elke vorm van represailles verbieden tegen door genoemde verdragen beschermde personen.   

### Artikel  61  

####Intreden van een situatie die de uitvoering onmogelijk maakt

1.  Een partij mag de onmogelijkheid tot uitvoering van een verdrag als grond aanvoeren om het te beëindigen of zich daaruit terug te trekken indien deze onmogelijkheid een gevolg is van de definitieve verdwijning of vernietiging van een voorwerp, onmisbaar voor de uitvoering van het verdrag. Indien de onmogelijkheid tijdelijk is, kan zij slechts worden aangevoerd als grond voor opschorting van de werking van het verdrag.   
2.  Een partij mag niet de onmogelijkheid van uitvoering aanvoeren als grond voor de beëindiging van het verdrag, voor de terugtrekking daaruit of voor het opschorten van de werking ervan, als deze onmogelijkheid het gevolg is van een schending door die partij hetzij van een verplichting voortvloeiend uit het verdrag, hetzij van iedere andere internationale verplichting met betrekking tot iedere andere partij bij het verdrag.   

### Artikel  62  

####Wezenlijke verandering der omstandigheden

1.  Een wezenlijke verandering der omstandigheden, ingetreden ten aanzien van die welke op het tijdstip van de totstandkoming van een verdrag bestonden en die niet door de partijen was voorzien, kan niet als grond voor de beëindiging van het verdrag of voor de terugtrekking daaruit worden aangevoerd, tenzij: 

a) het bestaan van deze omstandigheden een wezenlijke grond vormde voor de instemming van de partijen om door het verdrag gebonden te worden; en  

b) het gevolg van de wijziging is, dat de strekking van de krachtens het verdrag nog na te komen verplichtingen geheel en al wordt gewijzigd.     
2.  Een wezenlijke verandering der omstandigheden kan niet worden aangevoerd als grond voor de beëindiging van een verdrag of voor de terugtrekking daaruit: 

a) indien het verdrag een grens vaststelt; of  

b) indien de wezenlijke verandering een gevolg is van schending door de partij die de grond aanvoert, hetzij van een verplichting voortvloeiend uit het verdrag, hetzij van iedere andere internationale verplichting met etrekking tot iedere andere partij bij het verdrag.     
3.  Als een partij overeenkomstig de voorgaande leden als grond voor het beëindigen van een verdrag of het zich daaruit terugtrekken een wezenlijke verandering van omstandigheden kan aanvoeren, mag zij eveneens de wijziging aanvoeren als grond voor de opschorting van de werking van het verdrag.   

### Artikel  63  

####Het verbreken van diplomatieke of consulaire betrekkingen

Het verbreken van de diplomatieke of de consulaire betrekkingen tussen partijen bij een verdrag heeft geen gevolgen voor de rechtsbetrekkingen, door het verdrag tussen hen geschapen, behalve in zoverre het bestaan van diplomatieke of consulaire betrekkingen onontbeerlijk is voor de toepassing van het verdrag.  

### Artikel  64  

####Een nieuwe dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht (jus cogens)

Ingeval van een nieuwe dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht, wordt elk bestaand verdrag dat in strijd is met deze norm nietig en eindigt het.  

### AFDELING  4  

####PROCEDURE

### Artikel  65  

####Procedure te volgen bij ongeldigheid, beëindiging van een verdrag, terugtrekking uit een verdrag of opschorting van de werking van het verdrag

1.  De partij die op grond van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag zich beroept op hetzij een gebrek in zijn instemming door een verdrag gebonden te worden, hetzij een motief om de geldigheid van een verdrag te betwisten, het te beëindigen, zich daaruit terug te trekken of de werking ervan op te schorten, moet de andere partijen van zijn eis in kennis stellen. De kennisgeving dient aan te geven welke maatregel tegen het verdrag wordt beoogd alsmede de redenen daarvoor.   
2.  Als, na afloop van een periode die, behalve in geval van bijzondere noodzaak, niet korter mag zijn dan drie maanden te rekenen vanaf de ontvangst van de kennisgeving, geen partij bezwaar heeft gemaakt, kan de partij, die de kennisgeving heeft gedaan op de wijze als beschreven in artikel 67, de door haar beoogde maatregel nemen.   
3.  Als echter bezwaar wordt gemaakt door een andere partij, dienen de partijen een oplossing te zoeken met behulp van de middelen, aangegeven in artikel 33 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties.   
4.  Niets in de voorgaande leden tast de rechten of de verplichtingen van partijen aan voortvloeiende uit de tussen hen van kracht zijnde bepalingen betreffende de regeling van geschillen.   
5.  Onverminderd artikel 45 verhindert het feit dat een Staat niet de in het eerste lid voorgeschreven kennisgeving heeft gedaan hem niet alsnog een dergelijke kennisgeving te doen ten antwoord aan een andere partij die de uitvoering van een verdrag eist of de schending ervan aanvoert.   

### Artikel  66  

####Procedures voor rechtspraak, arbitrage en conciliatie

Als binnen een periode van twaalf maanden volgend op de datum waarop bezwaar is gemaakt het niet mogelijk is gebleken een oplossing te bereiken overeenkomstig artikel 65, derde lid, worden de volgende procedures toegepast: 

a) elke partij bij een geschil betreffende de toepassing of uitlegging van de artikelen 53 of 64 kan door middel van een verzoekschrift dit geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof tenzij de partijen in gezamenlijke overeenstemming besluiten het geschil aan arbitrage te onderwerpen;

### Artikel  69  

####Gevolgen van de ongeldigheid van een verdrag

1.  Een verdrag waarvan de ongeldigheid krachtens dit Verdrag wordt vastgesteld, is nietig. De bepalingen van een nietig verdrag hebben geen rechtskracht.   
2.  Als niettemin handelingen zijn verricht op grond van een zodanig verdrag: 

a) kan elke partij van elke andere partij eisen, dat zij, voor zover zulks in hun wederzijdse betrekkingen mogelijk is, de situatie tot stand brengt die zou hebben bestaan indien deze handelingen niet zouden zijn verricht;  

b) zijn handelingen, te goeder trouw verricht voordat de ongeldigheid was aangevoerd, niet onrechtmatig geworden uitsluitend doordat het verdrag ongeldig is geworden.     
3.  In gevallen, waarop de artikelen 49, 50, 51 of 52 betrekking hebben, is het tweede lid niet van toepassing op de partij waaraan het bedrog, de corruptiehandeling of de dwang is toe te rekenen.   
4.  Ingeval van ongeldigheid van de instemming van een Staat door een multilateraal verdrag gebonden te worden, zijn de voorgaande regels van toepassing op de betrekkingen tussen de genoemde Staat en de partijen bij het verdrag.   

### Artikel  70  

####Gevolgen van de beëindiging van een verdrag

1.  De beëindiging van een verdrag krachtens zijn bepalingen of overeenkomstig dit Verdrag 

a) ontslaat de partijen van de verplichting de uitvoering van het verdrag voort te zetten;  

b) tast geen enkel recht, geen enkele verplichting of geen enkele rechtspositie van partijen aan, die door de uitvoering van het verdrag vóór zijn beëindiging is ontstaan;   tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt of de partijen anders overeenkomen.   
2.  Indien een Staat een multilateraal verdrag opzegt of zich daaruit terugtrekt, is met ingang van de datum waarop deze opzegging of terugtrekking effect krijgt het eerste lid van toepassing op de betrekkingen tussen deze Staat en ieder der andere partijen bij het verdrag.   

### Artikel  71  

####Gevolgen van de nietigheid van een verdrag dat strijdig is met een dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht

1.  Ingeval een verdrag nietig is krachtens artikel 53, zijn de partijen gehouden: 

a) zoveel als mogelijk is de gevolgen weg te nemen van iedere handeling verricht op grond van een bepaling die strijdig is met de dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht; en  

b) hun wederzijdse betrekkingen in overeenstemming te brengen met de dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht.     
2.  Ingeval een verdrag nietig wordt en eindigt krachtens artikel 64: 

a) ontslaat de beëindiging van het verdrag de partijen van de verplichting de uitvoering van het verdrag voort te zetten;  

b) tast de beëindiging van het verdrag geen enkel recht, geen enkele verplichting of geen enkele rechtspositie van partijen aan, die door de uitvoering van het verdrag vóór zijn beëindiging is ontstaan; deze rechten, verplichtingen en rechtspositie kunnen daarna echter slechts worden gehandhaafd in zoverre deze handhaving op zich niet strijdig is met de nieuwe dwingende norm van algemeen volkenrecht.     

### Artikel  72  

####Gevolgen van de opschorting van de werking van een verdrag

1.  De opschorting van de werking van een verdrag op grond van zijn bepalingen of overeenkomstig dit Verdrag - tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt of de partijen anders overeenkomen -: 

a) ontslaat de partijen tussen welke de werking van het verdrag is opgeschort van de verplichting het verdrag uit te voeren in hun onderlinge betrekkingen gedurende de tijd van opschorting;  

b) tast voor het overige de door het verdrag geschapen rechtsbetrekkingen tussen de partijen niet aan.     
2.  Gedurende de tijd van opschorting moeten de partijen zich onthouden van alle handelingen die een belemmering voor een hervatte werking van het verdrag kunnen vormen.

####Onderscheidene bepalingen

### Artikel  73  

####Gevallen van Statenopvolging, van Staatsaansprakelijkheid of van het uitbreken van vijandelijkheden

### Artikel  74  

####Diplomatieke of consulaire betrekkingen en het sluiten van verdragen

Het verbreken of de afwezigheid van diplomatieke of consulaire betrekkingen tussen twee of meer Staten is geen belemmering voor het sluiten van verdragen tussen deze Staten. Het sluiten van een verdrag heeft op zichzelf geen gevolg voor de diplomatieke of consulaire betrekkingen.  

### Artikel  75  

####Geval van een aanvallende Staat

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag laten onverlet de verplichtingen die met betrekking tot een verdrag voor een aanvallende Staat kunnen voortvloeien uit maatregelen, genomen overeenkomstig het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties ter zake van door deze Staat gepleegde agressie.

De depositaris kan zijn: een of meer Staten, een internationale organisatie of de voornaamste administratieve functionaris van een zodanige organisatie.   
2.  De functies van de depositaris zijn internationaal van aard en de depositaris is gehouden onpartijdig te handelen bij het vervullen van zijn functies. Met name het feit dat een verdrag niet in werking is getreden tussen bepaalde partijen of dat er een verschil van mening is ontstaan tussen een Staat en een depositaris met betrekking tot de uitvoering van de functies van deze laatste mag geen invloed hebben op deze verplichting.   

### Artikel  77  

####Functies van de depositarissen

1.  Tenzij het verdrag anders bepaalt of de verdragsluitende partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, zijn de functies van de depositaris in het bijzonder de volgende: 

a) het onder zijn berusting houden van de originele tekst van het verdrag en de volmachten die aan de depositaris zijn overgelegd;  

b) voor gelijkluidend gewaarmerkte afschriften te doen vervaardigen van de originele tekst en alle andere teksten van het verdrag in andere talen die door het verdrag kunnen zijn voorgeschreven en die te doen toekomen aan de partijen bij het verdrag en de Staten die gerechtigd zijn het te worden;  

c) alle ondertekeningen van het verdrag in ontvangst te nemen, alle akten, kennisgevingen en mededelingen met betrekking tot het verdrag in ontvangst te nemen en te bewaren;  

d) te onderzoeken of een ondertekening, een akte, een kennisgeving of een mededeling betrekking hebbend op het verdrag, in goede en behoorlijke vorm is en, indien nodig, de zaak onder de aandacht van de betrokken Staat te brengen;  

e) de partijen bij het verdrag en de Staten die gerechtigd zijn het te worden in te lichten over akten, kennisgevingen en mededelingen betreffende het verdrag;  

f) de Staten die gerechtigd zijn partij te worden bij het verdrag in te lichten over de datum waarop het voor de inwerkingtreding van het verdrag vereiste aantal ondertekeningen of akten van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding is ontvangen of nedergelegd;  

g) zorg te dragen voor de registratie van het verdrag bij het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties;  

h) de functies te vervullen die nader zijn omschreven in de andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag.     
2.  Indien zich een verschil van mening voordoet tussen een Staat en de depositaris met betrekking tot de vervulling van de functies van laatstgenoemde, moet de depositaris deze kwestie onder de aandacht brengen van de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten of, indien nodig, van het bevoegde orgaan van de betreffende internationale organisatie.   

### Artikel  78  

####Kennisgevingen en mededelingen

Behalve in het geval waarin het verdrag of dit Verdrag anders bepaalt, moet een kennisgeving of mededeling die door een Staat moet worden gedaan krachtens dit Verdrag: 

a) indien er geen depositaris is, rechtstreeks gericht worden aan de Staten waarvoor zij is bestemd, of indien er een depositaris is, aan deze;  

b) worden beschouwd als gedaan door de betrokken Staat eerst vanaf de ontvangst door de Staat waaraan zij is gericht of, al naar gelang het geval, vanaf de ontvangst door de depositaris;  

c) indien zij is gericht aan de depositaris worden beschouwd als ontvangen door de Staat waarvoor zij is bestemd, eerst wanneer deze Staat door de depositaris in overeenstemming met artikel 77, eerste lid, letter e, daarover is ingelicht.    

### Artikel  79  

####Verbetering van fouten in de teksten of in de voor gelijkluidend gewaarmerkte afschriften van verdragen

1.  Als, na de authentificatie van de tekst van een verdrag de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten het er over eens zijn, dat deze tekst een fout bevat, moet de fout worden hersteld op een van de hierna genoemde wijzen, tenzij de genoemde Staten tot een andere wijze van verbetering besluiten: 

a) verbetering van de tekst in de juiste zin en parafering van de verbetering door behoorlijk gevolmachtigde vertegenwoordigers;  

b) opstelling van een akte of uitwisseling van akten waarin de verbetering is vastgesteld die men is overeengekomen aan te brengen in de tekst; of  

c) opstelling van een verbeterde tekst van het gehele verdrag, daarbij dezelfde procedure volgend als voor de originele tekst.     
2.  Wanneer het een verdrag betreft waarvoor een depositaris bestaat, brengt deze aan de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten de fout ter kennis alsmede het voorstel tot verbetering en stelt een redelijke termijn vast waarbinnen bezwaar kan worden gemaakt tegen de voorgestelde verbetering. Als na afloop van deze termijn: 

a) geen bezwaar is gemaakt, brengt de depositaris de verbetering in de tekst aan en parafeert haar, maakt een proces-verbaal op van de verbetering van de tekst en stuurt een kopie daarvan aan de partijen bij het verdrag en aan de partijen die gerechtigd zijn dit te worden;  

b) een bezwaar is gemaakt, deelt de depositaris het bezwaar mede aan de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten.     
3.  De regels, neergelegd in het eerste en tweede lid, zijn eveneens van toepassing indien de tekst was geauthentiseerd in twee of meer talen en zich ten aanzien van de eensluidendheid een gebrek voordoet dat, op grond van overeenstemming tussen de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten, moet worden hersteld.   
4.  De verbeterde tekst vervangt *ab initio* de gebrekkige tekst tenzij de ondertekenende Staten en de verdragsluitende Staten daarover anders beslissen.   
5.  De verbetering van een geregistreerde verdragstekst wordt ter kennis gebracht van het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties.   
6.  Wanneer een fout is ontdekt in een voor gelijkluidend gewaarmerkt afschrift van een verdrag moet de depositaris een proces-verbaal van de verbetering opstellen en er een kopie van sturen aan de ondertekenende Staten en aan de verdragsluitende Staten.   

### Artikel  80  

####Registratie en publikatie van verdragen

1.  Na hun inwerkingtreding moeten de verdragen gezonden worden aan het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties ter fine van, al naar gelang het geval, registratie of inschrijving in het register, alsmede voor publikatie.   
2.  De aanwijzing van een depositaris vormt diens machtiging om de in het voorgaande lid omschreven handelingen uit te voeren.

### Bijlage  

1. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties maakt een lijst van bemiddelaars op, samengesteld uit bekwame juristen, en houdt deze lijst bij. Te dien einde wordt iedere Lid-Staat van de Verenigde Naties of Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag uitgenodigd twee bemiddelaars aan te wijzen en de namen van de op deze wijze aangewezen personen vormen de lijst. De aanwijzing van de bemiddelaars, daarbij inbegrepen degenen die aangewezen worden om een voorkomende vacature te vervullen, wordt gedaan vooreen verlengbare periode van vijf jaar. Bij het einde van de periode waarvoor de bemiddelaars zijn aangewezen, gaan zij voort met het uitoefenen van de functies waarvoor zij zijn gekozen overeenkomstig het volgende lid.  

2. Wanneer overeenkomstig artikel 66 een verzoek is gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal legt hij het geschil voor aan een Bemiddelingscommissie die als volgt is samengesteld: De Staat of de Staten, welke een der partijen bij het geschil vormen, benoemen: 

a) een bemiddelaar met de nationaliteit van deze Staat of een van deze Staten, al dan niet gekozen uit de in het eerste lid bedoelde lijst; en  

b) een bemiddelaar die niet de nationaliteit bezit van deze Staat of een van deze Staten, gekozen uit de lijst.   De Staat of de Staten die de andere partij in het geschil vormen, benoemen op dezelfde wijze twee bemiddelaars. De vier bemiddelaars, gekozen door de partijen, moeten worden benoemd binnen zestig dagen te rekenen vanaf de dag waarop de Secretaris-Generaal het verzoek heeft ontvangen. Binnen zestig dagen volgende op de datum van de benoeming van de laatste van hen, benoemen de vier bemiddelaars een vijfde bemiddelaar, gekozen uit de lijst, die voorzitter zal zijn. Als de benoeming van de voorzitter of van een van de andere bemiddelaars niet binnen de voor deze benoeming hierboven voorgeschreven termijn geschiedt, wordt zij verricht door de Secretaris-Generaal binnen zestig dagen na het verstrijken van deze termijn. De Secretaris-Generaal kan als voorzitter aanwijzen, hetzij een van de in de lijst opgenomen personen, hetzij een van de leden van de Commissie voor het internationale recht. Elke periode waarbinnen een benoeming dient te geschieden, mag worden verlengd als de partijen bij het geschil het daarover eens zijn. Iedere vacature moet worden vervuld op de wijze die omschreven is voor de eerste benoeming.  

3. De Bemiddelingscommissie stelt zelf haar werkwijze vast. De Commissie kan, met instemming van de partijen bij het geschil, iedere partij bij het verdrag uitnodigen aan haar haar zienswijze mondeling of schriftelijk kenbaar te maken. De beslissingen en aanbevelingen van de Commissie worden genomen bij meerderheid van stemmen van haar vijf leden.  

4. De Commissie mag iedere maatregel welke een minnelijke schikking zou kunnen vergemakkelijken onder de aandacht brengen van de partijen bij het geschil.  

5. De Commissie hoort de partijen, onderzoekt de aanspraken en bezwaren en doet voorstellen aan de partijen om hen bij te staan in het bereiken van een minnelijke schikking van het geschil.  

6. De Commissie brengt binnen twaalf maanden na haar instelling verslag uit. Dit verslag wordt nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal en toegezonden aan de partijen bij het geschil. Het verslag van de Commissie, met inbegrip van alle daarin vermelde gevolgtrekkingen ten aahzieif van feiten of rechtskwesties, is niet bindend voor de partijen en zal geen andere betekenis hebben dan die van aanbevelingen, die ter overweging aan de partijen worden voorgelegd ten einde een minnelijke schikking van het geschil te vergemakkelijken.  

7. De Secretaris-Generaal verschaft de Commissie de hulp en de faciliteiten die zij behoeft. De uitgaven van de Commissie worden gedragen door de Verenigde Naties.
