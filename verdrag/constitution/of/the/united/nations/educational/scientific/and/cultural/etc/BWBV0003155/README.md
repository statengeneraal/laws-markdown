##Statuut van de Organisatie der Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur

####Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

Adopted in London on 16 November 1945 and amended by the General Conference at its 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th and 31st sessions. The Governments of the States Parties to this Constitution on behalf of their peoples declare: That since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed; That ignorance of each other’s ways and lives has been a common cause, throughout the history of mankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war; That the great and terrible war which has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races; That the wide diffusion of culture, and the education of humanity for justice and liberty and peace are indispensable to the dignity of man and constitute a sacred duty which all the nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual assistance and concern; That a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind. For these reasons, the States Parties to this Constitution, believing in full and equal opportunities for education for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of objective truth, and in the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, are agreed and determined to develop and to increase the means of communication between their peoples and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a truer and more perfect knowledge of each other’s lives; In consequence whereof they do hereby create the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the purpose of advancing, through the educational and scientific and cultural relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of international peace and of the common welfare of mankind for which the United Nations Organization was established and which its Charter proclaims.

####Statuut van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur

Aangenomen te Londen op 16 november 1945 en gewijzigd door de Algemene Conferentie tijdens haar tweede, derde, vierde, vijfde, zesde, zevende, achtste, negende, tiende, twaalfde, vijftiende, zeventiende, negentiende, twintigste, eenentwintigste, vierentwintigste, vijfentwintigste, zesentwintigste, zevenentwintigste, achtentwintigste, negenentwintigste en eenendertigste zitting. De Regeringen van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Statuut verklaren uit naam van hun volken: Dat aangezien oorlogen hun oorsprong vinden in de menselijke geest, ook de verdedigingswerken van de vrede in de menselijke geest moeten worden opgebouwd; Dat in de geschiedenis van de mensheid de onbekendheid met elkaars levensgewoonten een voortdurende bron is geweest van achterdocht en wantrouwen tussen de volken, waardoor hun geschillen al te vaak tot oorlog hebben geleid; Dat de grote en verschrikkelijke oorlog die nu ten einde is mogelijk werd gemaakt door de ontkenning van de democratische beginselen van waardigheid, gelijkheid en wederzijds respect van mensen en door de verspreiding, in de plaats daarvan en met uitbuiting van onwetendheid en vooroordeel, van de leer van de ongelijkheid van mensen en rassen; Dat de ruime verspreiding van cultuur en de opvoeding van de mensheid tot gerechtigheid, vrijheid en vrede onontbeerlijk zijn voor de menselijke waardigheid en een heilige plicht zijn, die alle volken moeten vervullen in een geest van onderlinge hulp en zorg; Dat een vrede die uitsluitend berust op de politieke en economische afspraken tussen regeringen niet de eenstemmige, duurzame en waarachtige steun van de volken voor zich zou kunnen winnen en dat de vrede derhalve, wil zij behouden blijven, gegrondvest moet worden op het intellectuele en morele saamhorigheidsgevoel van de mensheid. Om deze redenen zijn de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Statuut, gelovend in volledige en gelijke kansen op onderwijs voor iedereen, in het onbelemmerd nastreven van de objectieve waarheid en in de vrije uitwisseling van gedachten en kennis, overeengekomen en vastbesloten, de middelen van contact tussen hun volken te ontwikkelen en te vermeerderen en deze middelen te laten dienen tot wederzijds begrip en tot een waarachtiger en vollediger kennis van elkaars leven. In overeenstemming hiermee richten zij bij dezen de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur op, teneinde door middel van contact tussen de volken op het gebied van onderwijs, wetenschap en cultuur het streven naar internationale vrede en het algemeen welzijn van de mensheid, waarvoor de Verenigde Naties werd opgericht en dat haar Handvest verkondigt, te bevorderen.    

### Artikel  I  

####Doelstellingen en taak

1.  De Organisatie heeft ten doel bij te dragen aan de vrede en veiligheid door de samenwerking van de volken door middel van onderwijs, wetenschap en cultuur te bevorderen, teneinde overal ter wereld de eerbied te bevorderen voor de rechtvaardigheid, de rechtsstaat en de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden, die door het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties worden bevestigd voor alle volken, zonder onderscheid naar ras, geslacht, taal of godsdienst.   
2.  Daartoe zal de Organisatie: 

a. meewerken aan de bevordering van wederzijdse kennis en wederzijds begrip tussen de volken met gebruikmaking van alle media voor massacommunicatie, en met het oog daarop aanbevelingen doen voor overeenkomsten die noodzakelijk zijn om het vrije verkeer van gedachten door woord en beeld te vergemakkelijken;  

b. het volksonderwijs en de verbreiding van de cultuur stimuleren: 

door samenwerking met de leden, op hun verzoek, bij de ontwikkeling van het onderwijs;  

door het tot stand brengen van samenwerking tussen de volken teneinde het ideaal van gelijke kansen op onderwijs voor iedereen, ongeacht ras, geslacht of enig sociaal of economisch onderscheid, te bevorderen;  

door het voorstellen van methoden van onderwijs die het meest geschikt zijn om de kinderen van de gehele wereld voor te bereiden op hun verantwoordelijkheden als vrije mensen;    

c. kennis behouden, vermeerderen en verspreiden: 

door het behoud en de bescherming te verzekeren van het werelderfgoed aan boeken, kunstwerken en monumenten van historisch of wetenschappelijk belang en door de betrokken volken aanbevelingen te doen voor de daartoe nodige internationale overeenkomsten;  

door de samenwerking tussen de volken op alle gebieden van intellectuele activiteit te bevorderen, waaronder begrepen de internationale uitwisseling van personen die werkzaam zijn op het gebied van onderwijs, wetenschap en cultuur, alsmede de uitwisseling van publicaties, voorwerpen van artistiek of wetenschappelijk belang en andere informatie;  

door het invoeren van methoden van internationale samenwerking, waardoor de volken van alle landen toegang krijgen tot datgene wat door elk van hen wordt gedrukt of gepubliceerd.       
3.  Teneinde de onafhankelijkheid, integriteit en vruchtbare diversiteit van beschavingen en onderwijsstelsels van de Lidstaten van de Organisatie te handhaven, is het de Organisatie verboden tussenbeide te komen in aangelegenheden die wezenlijk onder de nationale rechtsmacht van een staat vallen.

De Algemene Conferentie zal, wanneer zij dit wenselijk en in overeenstemming met de door haar te geven richtlijnen acht, internationale conferenties van Staten bijeenroepen inzake onderwijs, de exacte wetenschappen, de geesteswetenschappen en de verspreiding van kennis.

4.  Bij het aanvaarden van voorstellen die aan de Lidstaten worden voorgelegd, maakt de Algemene Conferentie onderscheid tussen aan de Lidstaten gedane aanbevelingen en hun ter bekrachtiging voorgelegde internationale overeenkomsten. In het eerste geval is een eenvoudige meerderheid van stemmen voldoende; in het laatste geval is een meerderheid van twee derden vereist.
