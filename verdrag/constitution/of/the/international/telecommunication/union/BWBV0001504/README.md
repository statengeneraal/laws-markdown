####Verkiezingen en aanverwante aangelegenheden

###De Raad

*7 PP-98* 1. Behoudens in geval van vacatures die zich voordoen in de in de nummers 10 tot en met 12 bedoelde omstandigheden, vervullen de in de Raad gekozen Lidstaten hun functie tot de datum waarop een nieuwe Raad wordt gekozen. Zij zijn herverkiesbaar. *8 PP-98* 2. 1) Wanneer, tussen twee Plenipotentiaire Conferenties, een zetel in de Raad vacant wordt, gaat deze van rechtswege over op de Lidstaat uit dezelfde regio als de Lidstaat wiens zetel vacant is geworden, die tijdens de voorgaande verkiezing het grootste aantal stemmen heeft gekregen van de niet gekozen Lidstaten. *9 PP-98* 2) Wanneer om welke reden dan ook een vacante zetel niet kan worden bezet overeenkomstig de in nummer 8 bedoelde procedure, verzoekt de voorzitter van de Raad de andere Lidstaten van de regio een kandidaat voor te stellen binnen een termijn van een maand, te rekenen vanaf de datum van het verzoek. Aan het einde van dit tijdvak verzoekt de voorzitter van de Raad de Lidstaten een nieuwe Lidstaat van de Raad te kiezen. De verkiezing vindt plaats door middel van geheime schriftelijke stemming. Dezelfde meerderheid als hierboven vermeld is vereist. De nieuwe Lidstaat van de Raad vervult zijn functie tot de verkiezing van de nieuwe Raad door de volgende bevoegde Plenipotentiaire Conferentie. *10* 3. Een zetel in de Raad wordt als vacant beschouwd: *11**a.* wanneer een Lidstaat van de Raad zich niet heeft laten vertegenwoordigen bij twee opeenvolgende gewone zittingen van de Raad; *12 PP-98* b) wanneer een Lidstaat afziet van zijn lidmaatschap van de Raad neerlegt. 
###Gekozen functionarissen

*13* 1 De Secretaris-Generaal, de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal en de directeuren van de Bureaus aanvaarden hun taken op de tijdens hun verkiezing door de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum. Zij blijven normaliter in functie tot de door de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum en zijn slechts eenmaal voor dezelfde functie herverkiesbaar. Onder herverkiezing wordt uitsluitend de mogelijkheid van een tweede termijn verstaan, ongeacht of deze al dan niet aansluit op de eerste termijn. *14* 2. Indien de functie van de Secretaris-Generaal vacant wordt, neemt de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal deze over en blijft hij in functie tot een door de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum. Wanneer de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal de Secretaris-Generaal op deze wijze opvolgt, wordt de functie van de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal geacht vacant te worden op diezelfde datum en worden de bepalingen van nummer 15 toegepast. *15* 3. Indien de functie van plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal meer dan 180 dagen voorafgaand aan de vastgestelde datum voor de bijeenroeping van de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vacant wordt, benoemt de Raad een opvolger voor het resterende deel van de termijn. *16* 4. Indien de functies van de Secretaris-Generaal en van de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal gelijktijdig vacant worden, verricht de directeur met de hoogste anciënniteit de taak van Secretaris-Generaal voor een tijdvak van ten hoogste 90 dagen. De Raad benoemt een Secretaris-Generaal en, indien de vacatures meer dan 180 dagen voorafgaand aan de vastgestelde datum voor de bijeenroeping van de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie ontstaan, een plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal. Een op deze wijze door de Raad benoemde functionaris blijft in dienst voor het resterende deel van de ambtstermijn van zijn voorganger. *17* 5. Indien de functie van een directeur onverwacht vacant wordt, neemt de Secretaris-Generaal de nodige maatregelen om te waarborgen dat de taken van die directeur worden verricht totdat de Raad tijdens de volgende gewone zitting na de datum waarop de vacature is ontstaan, een nieuwe directeur benoemt. Een op deze wijze benoemde directeur blijft in dienst tot de door de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum. *18* 6. Onverminderd de desbetreffende bepalingen van artikel 27 van het Statuut, voorziet de Raad in de vervulling van elke vacature van de functie van Secretaris-Generaal of plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal in de situatie omschreven in de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit artikel tijdens zijn gewone zitting, indien deze wordt gehouden binnen 90 dagen nadat een vacature ontstaat of tijdens een door de Voorzitter binnen de in die bepalingen vermelde tijdvakken bijeengeroepen zitting. *19* 7. De ambtstermijn van een functionaris die op grond van een benoeming ingevolge de nummers 14 tot en met 18 op de functie van een gekozen functionaris is benoemd, laat de mogelijkheid tot verkiezing of herverkiezing voor een dergelijke functie onverlet. 
###Leden van de Radioreguleringsraad

*20* 1 De leden van de Radioreguleringsraad aanvaarden hun taken op de tijdens hun verkiezing door de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum. Zij blijven in functie tot de door de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vastgestelde datum en zijn slechts eenmaal herverkiesbaar. Onder herverkiezing wordt uitsluitend de mogelijkheid van een tweede termijn verstaan, ongeacht of deze al dan niet aansluit op de eerste termijn. *21* 2. Indien een lid van de Reguleringsraad, in het tijdvak tussen twee Plenipotentiaire Conferenties, aftreedt of niet langer in staat is zijn taak te verrichten, verzoekt de Secretaris-Generaal, in overleg met de Directeur van het Radiocommunicatiebureau, de Lidstaten van de betrokken regio tijdens de volgende zitting van de Raad kandidaten voor te dragen voor de verkiezing van een vervanger. Indien de vacature evenwel meer dan 90 dagen voor een zitting van de Raad of na een zitting van de Raad voorafgaand aan de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie ontstaat, benoemt de betrokken Lidstaat zo snel mogelijk en binnen 90 dagen, een andere ingezetene als vervanger, die in functie blijft totdat het nieuwe door de Raad benoemde lid zijn functie aanvaardt of totdat de door de volgende Plenipotentiaire Conferentie gekozen nieuwe leden van de Raad hun functie aanvaarden, naar gelang van het geval. De vervanger kan worden voorgedragen voor verkiezing door de Raad of door de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie, naar gelang van het geval. *22* 3. Een lid van de Radioreguleringsraad wordt geacht niet langer in staat te zijn zijn taken te verrichten na drie opeenvolgende absenties bij vergaderingen van de Reguleringsraad. De Secretaris-Generaal kondigt, na overleg met de voorzitter van de Reguleringsraad alsmede met het lid van de Reguleringsraad en de betrokken Lidstaat het bestaan van een vacature in de Reguleringsraad aan en neemt de in nummer 21 bedoelde maatregelen.

Bij afwezigheid van de voorzitter en vice-voorzitter, kiest de Raad – ad hoc – een tijdelijke voorzitter uit zijn leden. *145* 2) De Reguleringsraad houdt normaliter ten hoogste vier vergaderingen per jaar, met een duur van ten hoogste vijf dagen, in het algemeen op de zetel van de Unie, waarbij ten minste twee derde van zijn leden aanwezig zijn, en kan zijn taken verrichten met gebruikmaking van moderne communicatiemiddelen. Indien de Reguleringsraad zulks noodzakelijk acht kan hij, afhankelijk van de te behandelen aangelegenheden, het aantal vergaderingen evenwel vermeerderen. In uitzonderlijke gevallen kunnen de vergaderingen ten hoogste twee weken duren. *146* 3) De Raad streeft ernaar zijn besluiten op basis van unanimiteit te nemen. Indien dit niet kan worden gerealiseerd, is een besluit alleen geldig indien ten minste tweederde van de leden van de Raad voor stemmen. Elk lid van de Raad heeft een stem; stemming bij volmacht is niet toegestaan. *147* 4) De Raad kan de door hem nodige geachte interne regelingen treffen, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Statuut, van dit Verdrag en van het Radioreglement. Deze regelingen worden gepubliceerd als onderdeel van het reglement van orde van de Raad.

####GEMEENSCHAPPELIJKE BEPALINGEN VOOR DE DRIE SECTOREN

### Artikel  19  

####Participatie in de activiteiten van de Unie door entiteiten en organisaties anders dan administraties

*228* 1. De Secretaris-Generaal en de directeuren van de bureaus bevorderen een grotere participatie in de activiteiten van de Unie door de volgende entiteiten en organisaties: *229 PP-98* a. erkende exploitatiemaatschappijen, wetenschappelijke of industriële organisaties en financiële instellingen of ontwikkelingsorganisaties die door de betrokken Lidstaat zijn goedgekeurd; *230 PP-98* b. andere entiteiten die zich bezighouden met telecommunicatie-aangelegenheden die door de betrokken Lidstaat zijn goedgekeurd; *231 PP-98* c. regionale en andere internationale telecommunicatie-, standaardisatie-, financiële of ontwikkelingsorganisaties. *232* 2. De directeuren van de Bureaus onderhouden nauwe werkrelaties met deze entiteiten en organisaties die bevoegd zijn deel te nemen aan de activiteiten van een of meerdere Sectoren van de Unie. *233 PP-98* 3. Elk verzoek van een in nummer 229 genoemde entiteit om deelname aan de werkzaamheden van een Sector, gedaan in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende bepalingen van het Statuut en dit Verdrag, dat door de desbetreffende Lidstaat wordt goedgekeurd, wordt door deze laatste aan de Secretaris-Generaal doorgezonden. *234 PP-98* 4. Elk verzoek van een in nummer 230 bedoelde entiteit dat door de desbetreffende Lidstaat wordt ingediend, wordt behandeld in overeenstemming met een door de Raad ingestelde procedure. Een dergelijk verzoek wordt door de Raad beoordeeld op conformiteit met de bovengenoemde procedure. *234A PP-98* 4bis Als alternatief kan een verzoek van een in nummer 229 of 230 genoemde entiteit om Sectorlid te worden, rechtstreeks aan de Secretaris-Generaal worden gericht. De Lidstaten die dergelijke entiteiten toestaan rechtstreeks een verzoek aan de Secretaris-Generaal te richten, brengen deze laatste hiervan op de hoogte. De entiteiten wier Lidstaat deze mededeling niet aan de Secretaris-Generaal heeft verstrekt, kunnen geen rechtstreeks verzoek indienen. De Secretaris-Generaal zorgt voor een regelmatige actualisering en publicatie van een lijst van de Lidstaten die entiteiten onder hun rechtsmacht of soevereiniteit hebben toegestaan rechtstreeks verzoeken in te dienen. *234B PP-98* 4ter Bij de rechtstreekse ontvangst van een verzoek van een entiteit ingevolge nummer 234A, ziet de Secretaris-Generaal op basis van door de Raad vastgestelde criteria op toe dat de functie en het doel van de kandidaat in overeenstemming zijn met het doel van de Unie. Vervolgens brengt de Secretaris-Generaal de Lidstaat van de aanvrager onverwijld op de hoogte en verzoekt deze om goedkeuring van het verzoek. Indien de Secretaris-Generaal binnen vier maanden geen bezwaar van de Lidstaat ontvangt, wordt een herinneringstelegram verzonden. Indien de Secretaris-Generaal binnen vier maanden na de datum van verzending van een herinneringstelegram geen bezwaar ontvangt, wordt de aanvraag geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. Indien door de Secretaris-Generaal een bezwaar van de Lidstaat wordt ontvangen, wordt de aanvrager door de Secretaris-Generaal verzocht contact op te nemen met de betrokken Lidstaat. *234C PP-98* 4quater Bij het toestaan van rechtstreekse verzoeken kan een Lidstaat de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis stellen dat hij de Secretaris-Generaal bevoegd verklaart elke aanvraag door een entiteit onder zijn rechtsbevoegdheid of soevereiniteit goed te keuren. *235* 5 Elk verzoek van een in nummer 231 hierboven bedoelde entiteit of organisatie (anders dan die welke worden bedoeld in de nummers 269B en 269C van dit Verdrag) om deelname aan de werkzaamheden van een Sector wordt aan de Secretaris-Generaal gezonden en behandeld in overeenstemming met door de Raad opgestelde procedures. *236* 6 Elk verzoek van een in de nummers 269B tot en met 269D van dit Verdrag bedoelde organisatie om deelname aan de werkzaamheden van een Sector wordt aan de Secretaris-Generaal gezonden en de betrokken organisatie wordt in de in nummer 237 hieronder bedoelde lijsten opgenomen. *237 PP-98* 7 De Secretaris-Generaal stelt lijsten op, en actualiseert deze, van alle in de nummers 229 tot en met 231 en de nummers 269B tot en met 269D van dit Verdrag bedoelde entiteiten en organisaties die bevoegd zijn deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden van elke Sector, en publiceert en verzendt deze lijsten met een passende frequentie aan alle betrokken Lidstaten en Sectorleden alsmede aan de directeur van het betrokken Bureau. Die directeur brengt deze entiteiten en organisaties op de hoogte van de maatregelen die naar aanleiding van hun verzoeken zijn genomen, en brengt de desbetreffende Lidstaten op de hoogte. *238 PP-98* 8. De voorwaarden voor deelname in de Sectoren door de op de in nummer 237 bedoelde lijsten vermelde entiteiten en organisaties worden genoemd in dit artikel, in artikel 33 en in andere relevante bepalingen van dit Verdrag. De bepalingen van de nummers 25 tot en met 28 van het Statuut zijn niet op hen van toepassing. *239 PP-94 PP-98* 9. Een Sectorlid kan optreden namens de Lidstaat die het heeft goedgekeurd, mits de Lidstaat de directeur van het desbetreffende Bureau ervan op de hoogte brengt dat het daartoe bevoegd is. *240 PP-98* 10 Elk Sectorlid heeft het recht een dergelijke deelname op te zeggen door middel van een kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal. Een dergelijke deelname kan, in voorkomend geval, eveneens worden opgezegd door de betrokken Lidstaat of, in geval van een ingevolge nummer 234C hierboven goedgekeurde Lidstaat, in overeenstemming met de door de Raad vastgestelde criteria en procedures. Een dergelijke opzegging wordt van kracht na afloop van zes maanden, te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop de kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal is ontvangen. *241* 11. De Secretaris-Generaal verwijdert entiteiten of organisaties die niet langer bevoegd zijn aan de werkzaamheden van een Sector deel te nemen, van de lijst van entiteiten en organisaties, in overeenstemming met de door de Raad vastgestelde criteria en procedures. *241A PP-98* 12. De assemblee of conferentie van een Sector kan besluiten entiteiten of organisaties toe te staan als geassocieerd lid deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden van een bepaalde studiegroep of van subgroepen daarvan, op basis van de hieronder vermelde beginselen: *241B PP-98* 1) Een in de nummers 229 tot en met 231 bedoelde entiteit of organisatie kan een aanvraag indienen tot deelname als geassocieerd lid aan de werkzaamheden van een bepaalde studiegroep. *241C PP-98* 2) In geval een Sector heeft besloten geassocieerde leden toe te laten, past de Secretaris-Generaal de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit artikel toe op de aanvragers, met inachtneming van de omvang van de entiteit of organisatie en alle overige relevante criteria. *241D PP-98* 3) Geassocieerde leden die zijn toegelaten voor deelname in een bepaalde studiegroep worden niet op de in nummer 237 genoemde lijst vermeld. *241E PP-98* 4) De voorwaarden die van toepassing zijn op deelname aan de werkzaamheden van een studiegroep zijn vermeld in de nummers 248B en 483A van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  20  

####Werkwijze van studiegroepen

*242 PP-98* 1. De radiocommunicatie-assemblee, de mondiale telecommunicatiestandaardisatie-assemblee en de mondiale telecommunicatie-ontwikkelingsconferentie benoemen de voorzitter en een of meer vice-voorzitters voor elke studiegroep. Bij de benoeming van voorzitters en vice-voorzitters wordt bijzondere aandacht geschonken aan de eisen van competentie en billijke geografische spreiding, en de noodzaak van de bevordering van doeltreffender deelname door ontwikkelingslanden. *243 PP-98* 2. Indien de werklast van een studiegroep zulks vereist, benoemt de assemblee of conferentie zoveel extra vice-voorzitters als zij nodig acht. *244* 3. Indien, in het tijdvak tussen twee assemblees of conferenties van de desbetreffende Sector, een voorzitter van een studiegroep niet in staat is zijn taken te verrichten en slechts een vice-voorzitter is benoemd, neemt die vice-voorzitter de plaats van de voorzitter in. Wanneer voor een studiegroep meer dan een vice-voorzitter is benoemd, kiest de studiegroep tijdens de volgende vergadering een nieuwe voorzitter uit die vice-voorzitters en, indien nodig, een nieuwe vice-voorzitter uit de leden van de studiegroep. Op dezelfde wijze wordt een nieuwe vice-voorzitter gekozen indien een van de vice-voorzitters niet in staat is zijn taken gedurende dat tijdvak uit te oefenen. *245* 4. De studiegroepen verrichten hun werkzaamheden zoveel mogelijk door middel van correspondentie, met gebruikmaking van moderne communicatiemiddelen. *246* 5. De directeur van het Bureau van elke Sector stelt, op basis van beslissingen van de bevoegde conferentie of assemblee, na overleg met de Secretaris-Generaal en de ingevolge het Statuut en het Verdrag vereiste coördinatie, het algemene plan van werkgroepvergaderingen op. *246A PP-98* 5bis 1) Lidstaten en Sectorleden nemen vraagstukken ter bestudering aan in overeenstemming met de door de desbetreffende conferentie of assemblee, naargelang van toepassing, opgestelde procedures met de vermelding of een daaruit voortvloeiende aanbeveling al dan niet aanleiding is voor formeel overleg tussen de Lidstaten. *246B PP-98* 2) De uit de bestudering van bovengenoemde vraagstukken voortvloeiende aanbevelingen worden door een studiegroep aangenomen in overeenstemming met de door de desbetreffende conferentie of assemblee, naargelang het geval is, vastgestelde procedures. Aanbevelingen waarvoor geen formeel overleg met de Lidstaten vereist is ten behoeve van goedkeuring, worden geacht te zijn goedgekeurd. *246C PP-98* 3) Een aanbeveling waarvoor formeel overleg tussen de Lidstaten vereist is, wordt, afhankelijk van het geval, hetzij behandeld in overeenstemming met nummer 247, hetzij doorgestuurd aan de desbetreffende conferentie of assemblee. *246D PP-98* 4) De nummers 246A en 246B worden niet gebruikt voor vraagstukken en aanbevelingen die gevolgen hebben voor het beleid of de regelgeving, zoals: *246E PP-98* a) door de Radiocommunicatiesector goedgekeurde vraagstukken en aanbevelingen die betrekking hebben op de werkzaamheden van radiocommunicatieconferenties en andere door de radiocommunicatie-assemblee te bepalen categorieën van vraagstukken en aanbevelingen; *246F PP-98* b) door de Telecommunicatiestandaardisatiesector goedgekeurde vraagstukken en aanbevelingen die betrekking hebben op tarifaire en boekhoudkundige onderwerpen, en relevante nummer- en adresseringsplannen; *246G PP-98* c) door de Telecommunicatie-ontwikkelingssector goedgekeurde vraagstukken en aanbevelingen die betrekking hebben op onderwerpen van regelgevende, beleidsmatige en financiële aard; *246H PP-98* d) vraagstukken en aanbevelingen waarvan de reikwijdte onduidelijk is. *247 PP-98* 6. Studiegroepen kunnen actie ondernemen voor het verkrijgen van goedkeuring van Lidstaten voor aanbevelingen die zijn opgesteld tussen twee assemblees of conferenties. De procedures die moeten worden toegepast voor de verkrijging van een dergelijke goedkeuring zijn die welke door de bevoegde assemblee of conferentie, naargelang van het geval, zijn goedgekeurd. *247A PP-98* 6bis Aanbevelingen goedgekeurd bij toepassing van nummer 246B of 247 hebben dezelfde status als die welke door de conferentie of assemblee zelf worden goedgekeurd. *248* 7. Indien nodig kunnen gemeenschappelijke werkgroepen worden ingesteld voor de bestudering van vraagstukken waarvoor de deelname van deskundigen van meerdere studiegroepen vereist is. *248A PP-98* 7bis Op basis van een door de desbetreffende Sector opgestelde procedure, kan de directeur van een Bureau, in overleg met de voorzitter van de desbetreffende studiegroep, een organisatie die niet in de Sector deelneemt, uitnodigen vertegenwoordigers te sturen teneinde deel te nemen aan de bestudering van een specifieke aangelegenheid binnen de desbetreffende studiegroep of subgroepen hiervan. *248B PP-98* 7ter Het is een Partner, zoals bedoeld in nummer 241A van dit Verdrag, toegestaan deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden van de gekozen studiegroep zonder betrokken te zijn bij de besluitvormingsprocedure of liaison-activiteiten van die studiegroep. *249* 8. De directeur van het desbetreffende Bureau stuurt de uiteindelijke rapporten van de studiegroepen naar de administraties, organisaties en entiteiten die in de Sector deelnemen. Deze rapporten omvatten een lijst van de in overeenstemming met nummer 247 goedgekeurde aanbevelingen. Deze rapporten worden zo snel mogelijk verzonden en, in elk geval, tijdig genoeg om ten minste een maand voor de datum van de volgende zitting van de desbetreffende conferentie te kunnen worden ontvangen.  

### Artikel  21  

####Aanbevelingen van de ene conferentie aan de andere

*250* 1. Elke conferentie kan aan een andere conferentie van de Unie aanbevelingen voorleggen die onder haar competentie vallen. *251* 2 Deze aanbevelingen worden tijdig aan de Secretaris-Generaal verzonden ten behoeve van verzameling, coördinatie en mededeling, zoals bepaald in nummer 44 van de Algemene Regels voor conferenties, assemblees en vergaderingen van de Unie.  

### Artikel  22  

####Betrekkingen tussen de Sectoren onderling en met internationale organisaties

*252* 1. De directeuren van de Bureaus kunnen, na voldoende overleg en coördinatie zoals vereist door het Statuut, het Verdrag en de besluiten van de bevoegde conferenties of assemblees, overeenkomen gezamenlijke vergaderingen van studiegroepen van twee of drie Sectoren te organiseren voor bestudering en opstelling van ontwerpaanbevelingen inzake vraagstukken van gemeenschappelijk belang. Deze ontwerpaanbevelingen worden aan de bevoegde conferenties of assemblees van de desbetreffende Sectoren voorgelegd. *253* 2. De Secretaris-Generaal, de plaatsvervangend Secretaris-Generaal, de directeuren van de Bureaus van de andere Sectoren of hun vertegenwoordigers alsmede leden van de Radioreguleringsraad kunnen Conferenties of vergaderingen van een Sector in de hoedanigheid van adviseur bijwonen. Indien nodig kunnen zij vertegenwoordigers van het Algemeen Secretariaat of van elke andere Sector die het niet nodig heeft geacht te worden vertegenwoordigd, uitnodigen in de hoedanigheid van adviseur. *254* 3. Wanneer een Sector wordt uitgenodigd deel te nemen aan een vergadering van een internationale organisatie, is de directeur van deze Sector bevoegd, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van nummer 107 van dit Verdrag, regelingen te treffen voor zijn vertegenwoordiging in de hoedanigheid van adviseur.

### Artikel  31  

####Geloofsbrieven voor conferenties

*324 PP-98* 1. De door een Lidstaat naar een Plenipotentiaire Conferentie, een radiocommunicatieconferentie of een wereldconferentie voor internationale telecommunicatie gezonden delegatie moet naar behoren geaccrediteerd zijn, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de nummers 325 tot en met 331. *325* 2. 1) De accreditatie van delegaties voor Plenipotentiaire Conferenties geschiedt door middel van akten ondertekend door het staatshoofd, de regeringsleider of door de minister van buitenlandse zaken. *326* 2) De accreditatie van delegaties voor de overige in nummer 324 bedoelde conferenties geschiedt door middel van akten ondertekend door het staatshoofd, de regeringsleider, de minister van buitenlandse zaken of door de minister die verantwoordelijk is voor vraagstukken die tijdens de conferentie worden behandeld. *327 PP-98* 3) Onder voorbehoud van bevestiging, vóór de ondertekening van de Slotakten, door een van de in de nummers 325 of 326 bedoelde autoriteiten, kan een delegatie voorlopig worden geaccrediteerd door het hoofd van de diplomatieke missie van de betrokken Lidstaat bij de ontvangende regering. Ingeval een conferentie wordt gehouden in de Zwitserse Bondsstaat, kan een delegatie eveneens voorlopig worden geaccrediteerd door het hoofd van de permanente delegatie van de betrokken Lidstaat bij het kantoor van de Verenigde Naties te Genève. *328* 3. De geloofsbrieven worden aanvaard indien deze zijn ondertekend door een van de in de nummers 325 tot en met 327 bedoelde bevoegde autoriteiten en aan een van de volgende criteria beantwoorden: *329* – zij geven de delegatie volledige bevoegdheid; *330* – zij machtigen de delegatie haar regering zonder beperkingen te vertegenwoordigen; *331* – zij geven de delegatie, of bepaalde leden daarvan, het recht de Slotakten te ondertekenen. *332 PP-98* 4. 1) Een delegatie waarvan de geloofsbrieven door de plenaire vergadering in orde worden bevonden, is bevoegd het stemrecht van de desbetreffende Lidstaat uit te oefenen, onverminderd de bepalingen van de nummers 169 en 210 van het Statuut, en de Slotakten te ondertekenen. *333* 2) Een delegatie waarvan de geloofsbrieven door de plenaire vergadering niet in orde worden bevonden, is, zolang de situatie niet is hersteld, niet bevoegd het stemrecht uit te oefenen of de Slotakten te ondertekenen. *334 PP-98* 5. De geloofsbrieven moeten zo vroeg mogelijk bij het secretariaat van de conferentie worden nedergelegd; hiertoe behoren de Lidstaten hun geloofsbrieven, voorafgaand aan de openingsdatum van de conferentie, naar de Secretaris- Generaal te verzenden, die deze doorzendt naar het secretariaat van de conferentie, zodra dit is ingesteld. Het in nummer 68 van de Algemene Regels voor conferenties, assemblees en vergaderingen van de Unie bedoelde comité wordt belast met de verificatie daarvan en brengt van zijn conclusies verslag uit aan de plenaire vergadering, binnen de door deze laatste aangegeven tijdslimiet. Hangende het besluit van de plenaire vergadering terzake, is elke delegatie bevoegd aan de conferentie deel te nemen en het kiesrecht van de betrokken Lidstaat uit te oefenen. *335 PP-98* 6. Als algemene regel moeten de Lidstaten ernaar streven hun eigen delegaties naar conferenties van de Unie te zenden. Indien een Lidstaat evenwel op grond van uitzonderlijke redenen niet in staat is zijn eigen delegatie te zenden, kan hij de delegatie van een andere Lidstaat machtigen namens hem te stemmen en te ondertekenen. Een dergelijke machtiging moet worden gegeven door middel van een door een van de in de nummers 325 of 326 bedoelde autoriteiten ondertekende akte. *336* 7. Een delegatie met stemrecht kan een andere delegatie met stemrecht een machtiging geven voor het uitbrengen van haar stem tijdens een of meerdere vergaderingen waaraan zij niet kan deelnemen. In een dergelijk geval stelt zij de voorzitter van de conferentie hiervan tijdig schriftelijk in kennis. *337* 8. Een delegatie kan ten hoogste één stem bij volmacht uitbrengen. *338* 9. Door middel van een telegram verzonden geloofsbrieven of de overdracht van bevoegdheden worden niet geaccepteerd. Telegrafische antwoorden op verzoeken van de voorzitter of van het secretariaat van de conferentie om opheldering betreffende de geloofsbrieven worden daarentegen wel geaccepteerd. *339 PP-98* 10. Een Lidstaat of een bevoegde entiteit of organisatie die van plan is een delegatie of vertegenwoordigers naar een telecommunicatiestandaardisatie-assemblee, een telecommunicatie-ontwikkelingsconferentie of een radiocommunicatie-assemblee te zenden, brengt de directeur van het Bureau van de betrokken Sector hiervan op de hoogte, onder vermelding van de naam en functie van de delegatieleden of van de vertegenwoordigers.

Niettemin wordt de Sectorleden geen aparte bijdrage in rekening gebracht voor hun aanwezigheid bij een conferentie, assemblee of vergadering van hun respectieve Sectoren, behoudens in het geval van regionale radiocommunicatieconferenties. *477 PP-98* 2) Elk Sectorlid dat vermeld staat op de in nummer 237 van dit Verdrag bedoelde lijsten, draagt bij aan de dekking van de kosten van de Sector in overeenstemming met de nummers 480 en 480A. *478 en 479* (SUP) PP-98 *480 PP-94 PP-98* 5) Het bedrag van de bijdrage per eenheid voor de kosten van elke betrokken Sector, wordt vastgesteld op 1/5 van de contributie-eenheid van de Lidstaten. Deze bijdragen worden aangemerkt als inkomsten van de Unie. Zij dragen rente overeenkomstig de bepalingen van nummer 474. *480A PP-98* 5 *bis)* Wanneer een Sectorlid uit hoofde van nummer 159A van het Statuut bijdraagt aan het dekken van de kosten van de Unie, dient de Sector ten behoeve waarvan de bijdrage is gedaan te worden geïdentificeerd. *480B* 5 *ter*) In uitzonderlijke omstandigheden kan de Raad een vermindering van het aantal contributie-eenheden toestaan wanneer daartoe een verzoek wordt ingediend door een Sectorlid dat heeft aangetoond dat het niet langer de contributie in de door hem oorspronkelijk gekozen klasse kan bijdragen. *481 tot en met 483* (SUP) PP-98 *483A PP-98* 4bis Geassocieerde leden zoals omschreven in nummer 241A van dit Verdrag dragen bij aan de dekking van de kosten van de Sector en de studiegroep en subgroepen waaraan zij deelnemen, zoals vastgesteld door Raad. *484 PP-94 PP-98* 5.

Het bedrag van de reserverekening wordt jaarlijks door de Raad vastgesteld op basis van de verwachte behoefte. Aan het einde van elke tweejaarlijkse begrotingsperiode worden alle begrotingsoverschotten die niet zijn uitgegeven of gereserveerd, in het reservefonds gestort. De overige details van deze rekening worden omschreven in het Financieel Reglement. *486 PP-94* 7. 1) De Secretaris-Generaal kan, in overeenstemming met het Coördinatiecomité, vrijwillige contributies in contanten of in natura accepteren, mits de voorwaarden die aan dergelijke vrijwillige contributies zijn verbonden, in voorkomend geval, stroken met de doelstellingen en programma' s van de Unie en met de door een conferentie aangenomen programma's, en in overeenstemming zijn met het Financieel Reglement, dat bijzondere bepalingen bevat voor de acceptatie en het gebruik van dergelijke vrijwillige contributies. *487 PP-94* 2) Van deze vrijwillige contributies wordt door de Secretaris-Generaal in het financieel rapport verslag uitgebracht aan de Raad, alsmede in een beknopt overzicht waarin van elke vrijwillige contributie de herkomst, het beoogde gebruik en het gevolg dat hieraan is gegeven, worden vermeld.  

### Artikel  34  

####Financiële verantwoordelijkheden van de conferenties

Aan een besluit van een conferentie wordt geen gevolg gegeven indien een besluit rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks leidt tot een verhoging van de uitgaven boven de creditsaldi tot het toestaan waarvan de Raad bevoegd is.  

### Artikel  35  

####Talen

*490 PP-98* 1. 1) Andere talen dan die welke zijn genoemd in de desbetreffende bepalingen van artikel 29 van het Statuut kunnen worden gebruikt: *491 PP-98* a) indien een aanvraag is gedaan bij de Secretaris-Generaal strekkende tot het permanent of ad-hoc, mondeling of schriftelijk, gebruik van een aanvullende taal of aanvullende talen, mits de extra kosten die hiermee gemoeid zijn, worden gedragen door de Lidstaten die de aanvraag hebben gedaan of ondersteund; *492 PP-98* b) indien een delegatie bij conferenties en vergaderingen van de Unie, na de Secretaris-Generaal of de directeur van het betrokken Bureau hiervan op de hoogte te hebben gebracht, zelf op eigen kosten regelingen treft voor mondelinge vertaling uit haar eigen taal in een van de talen bedoeld in de desbetreffende bepalingen van artikel 29 van het Statuut. *493 PP-98* 2) In het in nummer 491 bedoelde geval, geeft de Secretaris-Generaal voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar gehoor aan de aanvraag, nadat de betrokken Lidstaten zich ertoe hebben verplicht de gemaakte kosten naar behoren aan de Unie terug te betalen. *494* 3) In het in nummer 492 bedoelde geval kan de delegatie bovendien, indien zij dit wenst, op eigen kosten zorgdragen voor mondelinge vertaling in haar eigen taal uit een van de talen bedoeld in de desbetreffende bepalingen van artikel 29 van het Statuut. *495 PP-98* 2. Alle documenten waarvan sprake is in de desbetreffende bepalingen van artikel 29 van het Statuut, kunnen worden gepubliceerd in andere talen dan die welke daarin zijn vermeld, mits de Lidstaten die om een dergelijke publicatie verzoeken, zich ertoe verplichten de volledige kosten van de vertaling en publicatie die hiermee gemoeid zijn, te dragen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####DIVERSE BEPALINGEN MET BETREKKING TOT DE EXPLOITATIE VAN TELECOMMUNICATIEDIENSTEN

### Artikel  36  

####Heffingen en gratis diensten

*496* De bepalingen inzake heffingen voor telecommunicatie en de diverse gevallen waarin gratis diensten worden verleend, zijn vervat in de Administratieve Reglementen.  

### Artikel  37  

####Opstelling en vereffening van rekeningen

*497 PP-98* 1. Het vereffenen van internationale rekeningen wordt beschouwd als een lopende transactie en wordt uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met de lopende internationale verplichtingen van de betrokken Lidstaten en Sectorleden, wanneer hun regeringen hieromtrent regelingen hebben getroffen. Wanneer dergelijke regelingen niet zijn getroffen, en bij gebreke van bijzondere regelingen ingevolge artikel 42 van het Statuut, vindt vereffening plaats overeenkomstig de Administratieve Reglementen. *498 PP-98* 2. Administraties van Lidstaten en Sectorleden die internationale telecommunicatiediensten exploiteren, dienen overeenstemming te bereiken over het bedrag van hun debet- en creditsaldi. *499* 3. Het rekeningoverzicht inzake de in nummer 498 bedoelde debet- en creditsaldi wordt opgemaakt in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de Administratieve Reglementen, tenzij tussen de betrokken partijen bijzondere regelingen zijn getroffen.  

### Artikel  38  

####Monetaire eenheid

*500 PP-98* Bij gebreke van bijzondere regelingen tussen Lidstaten worden voor de samenstelling van de verrekentarieven voor internationale telecommunicatiediensten en voor de opstelling van internationale rekeningen, de volgende monetaire eenheden gehanteerd:

– of de goudfrank,   beide zoals omschreven in de Administratieve Reglementen. De bepalingen inzake toepassing zijn vervat in Aanhangsel 1 bij het Internationale Telecommunicatiereglement.  

### Artikel  39  

####Onderlinge communicatie

*501* 1. Stations die radiocommunicatie verzorgen ten behoeve van mobiele communicatiediensten zijn verplicht, binnen de grenzen van hun normale gebruik, wederzijds radiocommunicatie uit te wisselen zonder onderscheid naar het door hen gebruikte radiosysteem. *502* 2. Niettemin, teneinde de vooruitgang van de wetenschap niet in de weg staan, verhinderen de bepalingen van nummer 501 niet het gebruik van een radiosysteem dat niet in staat is met andere systemen te communiceren, mits dit onvermogen wordt veroorzaakt door de specifieke aard van een dergelijk systeem en niet het gevolg is van apparatuur die uitsluitend wordt gebruikt met het oogmerk onderlinge communicatie te verhinderen. *503* 3. Onverminderd de bepalingen van nummer 501 kan een station worden ingezet voor een beperkte internationale telecommunicatiedienst, bepaald door het doel van deze dienst of door andere omstandigheden die geen verband houden met het gebruikte systeem.  

### Artikel  40  

####Geheimtaal

*504* 1. Regeringstelegrammen en diensttelegrammen kunnen in alle betrekkingen in geheimtaal worden opgesteld. *505 PP-98* 2. Privételegrammen in geheimtaal kunnen worden toegelaten tussen alle Lidstaten, met uitzondering van die welke, door tussenkomst van de Secretaris-Generaal van tevoren kennis hebben gegeven dat zij deze taal niet voor die categorie van correspondentie toestaan. *506 PP-98* 3. De Lidstaten die geen privételegrammen in geheimtaal afkomstig van of bestemd voor hun eigen grondgebied toestaan, moeten deze ter doorverzending aanvaarden, behoudens in geval van opschorting van de dienst zoals bedoeld in artikel 35 van het Statuut.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####ARBITRAGE EN WIJZIGING

### Artikel  41  

####Arbitrage: procedure (zie artikel 56 van het Statuut)

*507* 1. De partij die een beroep doet op arbitrage, initieert de arbitrageprocedure door middel van verzending aan de andere partij bij het geschil van de kennisgeving van de voorlegging van het geschil voor arbitrage. *508* 2. De partijen besluiten in onderling overleg of de arbitrage moet worden toevertrouwd aan individuele personen, administraties of regeringen. Indien, binnen een maand na de kennisgeving van voorlegging van het geschil voor arbitrage, de partijen hieromtrent geen overeenstemming hebben bereikt, wordt de arbitrage toevertrouwd aan regeringen. *509* 3. Indien de arbitrage wordt toevertrouwd aan individuele personen, mogen de arbiters noch ingezetenen zijn van een Staat die partij is bij het geschil, noch hun woonplaats hebben in de Staten die partij zijn bij het geschil, noch bij hen in dienst zijn. *510 PP-98* 4. Indien de arbitrage wordt toevertrouwd aan regeringen of aan administraties daarvan, moeten deze worden gekozen uit de Lidstaten die niet bij het geschil betrokken zijn, maar die partij zijn bij de overeenkomst waarvan de toepassing aanleiding tot het geschil heeft gegeven. *511* 5. Binnen drie maanden na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving van de voorlegging van het geschil ter arbitrage, benoemt elk van beide partijen bij het geschil een arbiter. *512* 6. Indien meer dan twee partijen bij het geschil betrokken zijn, wordt door elk van beide groepen van partijen met gemeenschappelijke belangen in het geschil een arbiter benoemd in overeenstemming met de in de nummers 510 en 511 genoemde procedure. *513* 7. De twee aldus benoemde arbiters kiezen een derde arbiter die, indien de eerste twee arbiters individuele personen zijn en niet regeringen of administraties, moet voldoen aan de in nummer 509 bedoelde voorwaarden en daarnaast niet dezelfde nationaliteit mag hebben als de twee andere arbiters. Bij gebreke van overeenstemming tussen de twee arbiters ten aanzien van de keuze van een derde arbiter, draagt elk van deze twee arbiters een derde arbiter voor die op geen enkele wijze bij het geschil betrokken is. De Secretaris-Generaal gaat vervolgens over tot loting om de derde arbiter aan te wijzen. *514* 8. De partijen bij het geschil kunnen overeenkomen dat hun geschil wordt geregeld door een enkele in onderlinge overeenstemming benoemde arbiter; ook kunnen zij beide een arbiter benoemen en de Secretaris-Generaal verzoeken tot loting over te gaan om te bepalen welke van de aldus voorgedragen personen als enkele arbiter optreedt. *515* 9. Het staat de arbiter of arbiters vrij een keuze te maken met betrekking tot de plaats van de arbitrage en de hierbij toe te passen procedureregels. *516* 10. De beslissing van de enkele arbiter is definitief en bindend voor de partijen bij het geschil. Indien de arbitrage wordt toevertrouwd aan meer dan een arbiter, is het besluit dat met de meerderheid van de stemmen van de arbiters is genomen, definitief en bindend voor de partijen. *517* 11. Elke partij draagt de kosten die zij heeft gemaakt ten behoeve van de arbitrage. De arbitragekosten die niet door de partijen zelf worden gedragen, worden gelijkelijk door de partijen bij het geschil gedeeld. *518* 12. De Unie verstrekt alle informatie met betrekking tot het geschil die de arbiter of arbiters nodig zouden kunnen hebben. Indien de partijen bij het geschil dit overeenkomen, wordt de beslissing van de arbiter of arbiters aan de Secretaris-Generaal medegedeeld voor toekomstig gebruik.  

### Artikel  42  

####Bepalingen voor de wijziging van dit Verdrag

*519 PP-98* 1. Elke Lidstaat kan wijzigingen van dit Verdrag voorstellen. Teneinde de tijdige verzending aan en bestudering door alle Lidstaten van een voorstel te waarborgen, moet dit door de Secretaris-Generaal uiterlijk acht maanden voor de vastgestelde openingsdatum van de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie zijn ontvangen. De Secretaris-Generaal zendt alle voorstellen zo snel mogelijk, doch uiterlijk zes maanden voor laatstgenoemde datum, door aan alle Lidstaten. *520 PP-98* 2. Elke voorgestelde aanpassing van een in overeenstemming met nummer 519 ingediende wijziging kan evenwel te allen tijde door een Lidstaat of door zijn delegatie aan de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie worden voorgelegd. *521* 3. Het tijdens een plenaire vergadering van de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie vereiste quorum voor de behandeling van een voorstel tot wijziging van dit Verdrag of de aanpassing van een dergelijk voorstel, bestaat uit meer dan de helft van de bij de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie geaccrediteerde delegaties. *522* 4. Om te worden aangenomen, moet een voorstel tot aanpassing van een voorgestelde wijziging alsmede het voorstel in zijn geheel, al dan niet aangepast, tijdens een plenaire vergadering worden goedgekeurd door meer dan de helft van de bij de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie geaccrediteerde delegaties die stemrecht hebben. *523 PP-98* 5. Tenzij in de voorgaande leden van dit artikel, die doorslaggevend zijn, anders is vermeld, zijn de Algemene Regels voor conferenties, assemblees en vergaderingen van de Unie van toepassing. *524 PP-98* 6. De door een Plenipotentiaire Conferentie aangenomen wijzigingen van dit Verdrag worden, in hun geheel en in de vorm van een enkele akte van wijziging, op een door de conferentie vastgestelde datum van kracht tussen de Lidstaten die voor die datum hun akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van, of toetreding tot zowel dit Verdrag als de akte van wijziging hebben nedergelegd. De bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van, of toetreding tot slechts een gedeelte van deze akte van wijziging is uitgesloten. *525* 7. Onverminderd nummer 524 kan de Plenipotentiaire Conferentie beslissen dat een wijziging van dit Verdrag noodzakelijk is voor de juiste uitvoering van een wijziging van het Statuut. In dat geval wordt de wijziging van dit Verdrag niet van kracht vóór het van kracht worden van de wijziging van het Statuut. *526 PP-98* 8. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt alle Lidstaten in kennis van de nederlegging van elke akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding. *527* 9. Na het van kracht worden van een akte van wijziging is de bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding in overeenstemming met de artikelen 52 en 53 van het Statuut, van toepassing op dit Verdrag zoals gewijzigd. *528* 10. Na het van kracht worden van een akte van wijziging registreert de Secretaris-Generaal deze bij het Secretariaat van de Verenigde Naties, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 102 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties. Nummer 241 van het Statuut is eveneens op de akten van wijziging van toepassing.
