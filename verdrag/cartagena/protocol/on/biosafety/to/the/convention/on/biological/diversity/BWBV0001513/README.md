### Annex  III  

####Risk assessment

###Objective

1. The objective of risk assessment, under this Protocol, is to identify and evaluate the potential adverse effects of living modified organisms on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the likely potential receiving environment, taking also into account risks to human health.   
###Use of risk assessment

2. Risk assessment is, inter alia, used by competent authorities to make informed decisions regarding living modified organisms.   
###General principles

3. Risk assessment should be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner, and can take into account expert advice of, and guidelines developed by, relevant international organizations.  

4. Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating a particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an acceptable risk.  

5. Risks associated with living modified organisms or products thereof, namely, processed materials that are of living modified organism origin, containing detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology, should be considered in the context of the risks posed by the non-modified recipients or parental organisms in the likely potential receiving environment.  

6. Risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis. The required information may vary in nature and level of detail from case to case, depending on the living modified organism concerned, its intended use and the likely potential receiving environment.   
###Methodology

7. The process of risk assessment may on the one hand give rise to a need for further information about specific subjects, which may be identified and requested during the assessment process, while on the other hand information on other subjects may not be relevant in some instances.  

8. To fulfil its objective, risk assessment entails, as appropriate, the following steps: 

a) An identification of any novel genotypic and phenotypic characteristics associated with the living modified organism that may have adverse effects on biological diversity in the likely potential receiving environment, taking also into account risks to human health;  

b) An evaluation of the likelihood of these adverse effects being realized, taking into account the level and kind of exposure of the likely potential receiving environment to the living modified organism;  

c) An evaluation of the consequences should these adverse effects be realized;  

d) An estimation of the overall risk posed by the living modified organism based on the evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of the identified adverse effects being realized;  

e) A recommendation as to whether or not the risks are acceptable or manageable, including, where necessary, identification of strategies to manage these risks; and  

f) Where there is uncertainty regarding the level of risk, it may be addressed by requesting further information on the specific issues of concern or by implementing appropriate risk management strategies and/or monitoring the living modified organism in the receiving environment.     
###Points to consider

9. Depending on the case, risk assessment takes into account the relevant technical and scientific details regarding the characteristics of the following subjects: 

a) Recipient organism or parental organisms. The biological characteristics of the recipient organism or parental organisms, including information on taxonomic status, common name, origin, centres of origin and centres of genetic diversity, if known, and a description of the habitat where the organisms may persist or proliferate;  

b) Donor organism or organisms. Taxonomic status and common name, source, and the relevant biological characteristics of the donor organisms;  

c) Vector. Characteristics of the vector, including its identity, if any, and its source or origin, and its host range;  

d) Insert or inserts and/or characteristics of modification. Genetic characteristics of the inserted nucleic acid and the function it specifies, and/or characteristics of the modification introduced;  

e) Living modified organism. Identity of the living modified organism, and the differences between the biological characteristics of the living modified organism and those of the recipient organism or parental organisms;  

f) Detection and identification of the living modified organism. Suggested detection and identification methods and their specificity, sensitivity and reliability;  

g) Information relating to the intended use. Information relating to the intended use of the living modified organism, including new or changed use compared to the recipient organism or parental organisms; and  

h) Receiving environment. Information on the location, geographical, climatic and ecological characteristics, including relevant information on biological diversity and centres of origin of the likely potential receiving environment.

### Bijlage  III  

####Risicobeoordeling

###Doel

1. Het doel van risicobeoordeling krachtens dit Protocol is de mogelijke nadelige gevolgen van gemodificeerde levende organismen voor het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van de biologische diversiteit in het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu vast te stellen en te beoordelen, waarbij ook rekening wordt gehouden met de risico's voor de gezondheid van de mens.   
###Gebruik van risicobeoordeling

2. Risicobeoordeling wordt onder andere door de bevoegde instanties gebruikt om met kennis van zaken een besluit over gemodificeerde levende organismen te kunnen nemen.   
###Algemene beginselen

3. Risicobeoordeling moet op een wetenschappelijk verantwoorde en transparante manier worden uitgevoerd en daarbij kan rekening worden gehouden met deskundige adviezen van relevante internationale organisaties en door hen ontwikkelde richtsnoeren.  

4. Het ontbreken van wetenschappelijke kennis of wetenschappelijke consensus mag niet noodzakelijkerwijs worden uitgelegd als een aanwijzing voor een bepaald risiconiveau, het ontbreken van risico's of een aanvaardbaar risico.  

5. Risico's die verbonden zijn aan gemodificeerde levende organismen of producten daarvan, te weten be- of verwerkte materialen die van een veranderd levend organisme afkomstig zijn en die detecteerbare nieuwe combinaties van repliceerbaar genetisch materiaal bevatten, verkregen door het gebruik van moderne biotechnologie, dienen te worden beschouwd in het kader van de risico's die verbonden zijn aan de onveranderde recipiënte of ouderorganismen in het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu.  

6. Risicobeoordeling dient per geval te worden uitgevoerd. De aard en de mate van detail van de vereiste informatie kunnen afhankelijk van het betrokken gemodificeerde levende organisme, het beoogde gebruik daarvan en het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu van geval tot geval verschillen.   
###Methodologie

7. De uitvoering van de risicobeoordeling kan enerzijds leiden tot een behoefte aan nadere informatie over specifieke onderwerpen, die tijdens het beoordelingsproces naar voren kan komen en kan worden geformuleerd, terwijl anderzijds informatie over andere onderwerpen in sommige gevallen niet relevant kan zijn.  

8. Om de doelstelling te verwezenlijken omvat risicobeoordeling indien van toepassing de volgende stappen: 

a. de identificatie van eventuele nieuwe genotypische en fenotypische kenmerken die verbonden zijn aan het gemodificeerde levende organisme en nadelige gevolgen kunnen hebben voor de biologische diversiteit in het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu, waarbij ook rekening wordt gehouden met de risico's voor de gezondheid van de mens;  

b. een beoordeling van de kans dat deze nadelige gevolgen zich voordoen, rekening houdend met de mate en de aard van de blootstelling van het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu aan het gemodificeerde levende organisme;  

c. een beoordeling van de consequenties van deze nadelige gevolgen, mochten zij zich voordoen;  

d. een raming van het algehele risico dat het gemodificeerde levende organisme vormt, gebaseerd op de beoordeling van de kans dat de omschreven nadelige gevolgen zich voordoen en de consequenties daarvan;  

e. een aanbeveling ten aanzien van de vraag of de risico's al dan niet aanvaardbaar of beheersbaar zijn, eventueel met inbegrip van de formulering van strategieën voor het beheer van deze risico's; en  

f. wanneer er onzekerheid bestaat over de grootte van het risico, is het mogelijk nadere informatie te vragen over de specifieke onderwerpen die zorg baren, passende strategieën voor risicobeheer uit te voeren en/of het gemodificeerde levend organisme in het ontvangende milieu te controleren.     
###Aandachtspunten

9. Afhankelijk van het geval wordt bij risicobeoordeling rekening gehouden met de relevante wetenschappelijke en technische details over de volgende onderwerpen: 

a. het recipiënte organisme of de ouderorganismen. De biologische kenmerken van het recipiënte organisme of de ouderorganismen, met inbegrip van informatie over de taxonomische status, de gangbare naam, de oorsprong, centra van oorsprong en centra van genetische diversiteit, indien bekend, en een beschrijving van de habitats waar de organismen zich kunnen handhaven of zich kunnen vermenigvuldigen;  

b. het donororganisme of de donororganismen. Taxonomische status, gangbare naam, oorsprong en de relevante biologische kenmerken van de donororganismen;  

c. vector. Kenmerken van de vector, met inbegrip van zijn eventuele identiteit, zijn bron of oorsprong en het gastheerbereik;  

d. insert of inserts en/of kenmerken van de verandering. De genetische kenmerken van het ingebrachte nucleïnezuur en de functie die het specificeert en/of de kenmerken van de geïntroduceerde verandering;  

e. veranderd levend organisme. Identiteit van het gemodificeerde levende organisme en de verschillen tussen de biologische kenmerken van het gemodificeerde levende organisme en die van het recipiënte organisme of de ouderorganismen;  

f. detectie en identificatie van het gemodificeerde levende organisme. Voorgestelde methoden voor detectie en identificatie en hun specificiteit, gevoeligheid en betrouwbaarheid;  

g. informatie over het beoogde gebruik. Informatie over het beoogde gebruik van het veranderd levend organisme, met inbegrip van nieuwe of veranderde toepassingen in vergelijking met het recipiënte organisme of de ouderorganismen; en  

h. ontvangend milieu. Informatie over de locatie en de geografische, klimatologische en ecologische kenmerken, met inbegrip van relevante informatie over de biologische diversiteit en centra van oorsprong van het vermoedelijke potentiële ontvangende milieu.
