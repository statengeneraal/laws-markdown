####Criminal Law Convention on Corruption

Preamble The member States of the Council of Europe and the other States signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members; Recognising the value of fostering co-operation with the other States signatories to this Convention; Convinced of the need to pursue, as a matter of priority, a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against corruption, including the adoption of appropriate legislation and preventive measures; Emphasising that corruption threatens the rule of law, democracy and human rights, undermines good governance, fairness and social justice, distorts competition, hinders economic development and endangers the stability of democratic institutions and the moral foundations of society; Believing that an effective fight against corruption requires increased, rapid and well-functioning international co-operation in criminal matters; Welcoming recent developments which further advance international understanding and co-operation in combating corruption, including actions of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the Organisation of American States, the OECD and the European Union; Having regard to the Programme of Action against Corruption adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in November 1996 following the recommendations of the 19th Conference of European Ministers of Justice (Valletta, 1994); Recalling in this respect the importance of the participation of non-member States in the Council of Europe's activities against corruption and welcoming their valuable contribution to the implementation of the Programme of Action against Corruption; Further recalling that Resolution No. 1 adopted by the European Ministers of Justice at their 21st Conference (Prague, 1997) recommended the speedy implementation of the Programme of Action against Corruption, and called, in particular, for the early adoption of a criminal law convention providing for the co-ordinated incrimination of corruption offences, enhanced co-operation for the prosecution of such offences as well as an effective follow-up mechanism open to member States and non-member States on an equal footing; Bearing in mind that the Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe decided, on the occasion of their Second Summit held in Strasbourg on 10 and 11 October 1997, to seek common responses to the challenges posed by the growth in corruption and adopted an Action Plan which, in order to promote co-operation in the fight against corruption, including its links with organised crime and money laundering, instructed the Committee of Ministers, *inter alia,* to secure the rapid completion of international legal instruments pursuant to the Programme of Action against Corruption; Considering moreover that Resolution (97) 24 on the 20 Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption, adopted on 6 November 1997 by the Committee of Ministers at its 101st Session, stresses the need rapidly to complete the elaboration of international legal instruments pursuant to the Programme of Action against Corruption; In view of the adoption by the Committee of Ministers, at its 102nd Session on 4 May 1998, of Resolution (98) 7 authorising the partial and enlarged agreement establishing the “Group of States against Corruption – GRECO", which aims at improving the capacity of its members to fight corruption by following up compliance with their undertakings in this field, Have agreed as follows:

De Groep van Staten tegen Corruptie (GRECO) draagt zorg voor het toezicht op de implementatie van dit Verdrag door de lidstaten.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####INTERNATIONALE SAMENWERKING

### Artikel  25  

####Algemene beginselen en maatregelen die van toepassing zijn op de internationale samenwerking

1.  De Partijen werken, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de toepasselijke internationale instrumenten inzake de internationale strafrechtelijke samenwerking of de afspraken die zijn overeengekomen op basis van uniforme of wederkerige wetgeving, en overeenkomstig hun nationaal recht, in zo ruim mogelijke mate met elkaar samen ten behoeve van onderzoeken en procedures met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten die vallen binnen de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Wanneer tussen Partijen geen internationaal instrument of onderlinge afspraak als bedoeld in het eerste lid van kracht is, zijn de artikelen 26 tot en met 31 van dit hoofdstuk van toepassing.   
3.  De artikelen 26 tot en met 31 van dit hoofdstuk zijn ook van toepassing wanneer zij gunstiger zijn dan de bepalingen die zijn opgenomen in de internationale instrumenten of in de afspraken als bedoeld in het eerste lid.   

### Artikel  26  

####Wederzijdse rechtshulp

1.  De Partijen verlenen elkaar in zo ruim mogelijke mate rechtshulp door verzoeken afkomstig van autoriteiten die krachtens hun nationale wetgeving bevoegd zijn tot het opsporen of vervolgen van de strafbare feiten die vallen binnen de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag onverwijld te behandelen.   
2.  Rechtshulp in de zin van het eerste lid van dit artikel kan worden geweigerd indien de aangezochte Partij van mening is dat het voldoen aan het verzoek mee zou kunnen leiden tot aantasting van haar fundamentele belangen, de nationale soevereiniteit, aan de nationale veiligheid of de openbare orde.   
3.  De Partijen kunnen niet met een beroep op het bankgeheim weigeren om krachtens dit hoofdstuk samen te werken. Wanneer haar interne recht het vereist, kan een Partij eisen dat een verzoek om samenwerking dat de opheffing van het bankgeheim zou inhouden, aan de goedkeuring wordt onderworpen van ofwel een rechter, ofwel een andere rechterlijke autoriteit, met inbegrip van het openbaar ministerie, welke autoriteit optreedt inzake strafbare feiten.   

### Artikel  27  

####Uitlevering

1.  De strafbare feiten die vallen onder de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag worden geacht in elk tussen de Partijen bestaand uitleveringsverdrag te zijn begrepen als uitleveringsdelicten. De Partijen verplichten zich ertoe deze strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.  Indien een Partij die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Partij waarmee zij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan zij dit Verdrag beschouwen als wettelijke basis voor uitlevering wegens ieder overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit.   
3.  De Partijen die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten als uitleveringsdelicten.   
4.  Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de voorwaarden, bepaald in de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij of in de toepasselijke uitleveringsverdragen, met inbegrip van de gronden waarop de aangezochte Partij de uitlevering kan weigeren.   
5.  Indien de uitlevering voor een overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit wordt geweigerd uitsluitend op grond van de nationaliteit van de persoon, of omdat de aangezochte Partij van oordeel is dat zij in het onderhavige geval tot kennisneming bevoegd is, legt de aangezochte Partij de zaak met het oog op vervolging voor aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten, tenzij met de verzoekende Partij anders is overeengekomen, en deelt zij de definitieve uitkomst daarvan te gelegener tijd mee aan de verzoekende Partij.   

### Artikel  28  

####Informatie uit eigen beweging

Onverminderd haar eigen onderzoeken en procedures, kan een Partij zonder voorafgaand verzoek aan een andere Partij feitelijke gegevens verstrekken wanneer zij van oordeel is dat het vrijgeven van bedoelde gegevens de ontvangende Partij kan helpen bij het instellen of uitvoeren van onderzoeken of strafvervolgingen ter zake van de krachtens dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten of kan leiden tot een verzoek van die Partij in de zin van dit hoofdstuk.  

### Artikel  29  

####Centrale autoriteit

1.  De Partijen wijzen een centrale autoriteit of, waar nodig, verscheidene centrale autoriteiten aan, belast met het verzenden en het beantwoorden van de krachtens dit hoofdstuk opgestelde verzoeken en met de uitvoering daarvan of de doorzending aan de autoriteiten die bevoegd zijn deze uit te voeren.   
2.  Iedere Partij deelt, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij het nederleggen van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa de naam en het adres van de ingevolge het eerste lid aangewezen autoriteiten mee.   

### Artikel  30  

####Rechtstreekse contacten

1.  De centrale autoriteiten onderhouden rechtstreeks contact met elkaar.   
2.  In spoedeisende gevallen kunnen de verzoeken om rechtshulp of daarop betrekking hebbende mededelingen rechtstreeks verzonden worden door de rechterlijke autoriteiten, met inbegrip van het openbaar ministerie, van de verzoekende Partij aan zodanige autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij. In dergelijke gevallen dient tegelijkertijd door tussenkomst van de centrale autoriteit van de verzoekende Partij een afschrift te worden gezonden aan de centrale autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij.   
3.  Elk verzoek of mededeling overeenkomstig het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel, kan worden gedaan door tussenkomst van Interpol.   
4.  Wanneer een verzoek overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel is gedaan en de benaderde autoriteit niet bevoegd is om daaraan gevolg te geven, zendt deze het verzoek door naar de bevoegde autoriteit en stelt deze de verzoekende Partij daarvan rechtstreeks op de hoogte.   
5.  De verzoeken of mededelingen, gedaan overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, die geen toepassing van dwangmiddelen vergen, kunnen door de bevoegde autoriteit van de verzoekende Partij rechtstreeks worden toegezonden aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij.   
6.  Iedere Staat kan, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij het nederleggen van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa meedelen dat, om redenen van doelmatigheid, de met inachtneming van dit hoofdstuk opgestelde verzoeken gezonden moeten worden aan zijn centrale autoriteit.   

### Artikel  31  

####Inlichtingen

De aangezochte Partij licht de verzoekende Partij onverwijld in over het onmiddellijk gevolg dat aan een krachtens dit hoofdstuk opgesteld verzoek is gegeven alsmede over het resultaat daarvan.

### Artikel  38  

####Geldigheid en herziening van verklaringen en voorbehouden

1.  De verklaringen, bedoeld in artikel 36, en de voorbehouden, bedoeld in artikel 37, zijn drie jaar geldig, gerekend vanaf de eerste dag van de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag ten aanzien van de betrokken Staat. Dergelijke verklaringen en voorbehouden kunnen evenwel worden verlengd met tijdvakken van dezelfde duur.   
2.  Twaalf maanden voor de datum van het verstrijken van de geldigheidsduur van de verklaring of het voorbehoud geeft de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa van dat verstrijken kennis aan de betrokken Staat. Drie maanden voor de datum van het verstrijken geeft de Staat de Secretaris-Generaal kennis van zijn voornemen om de verklaring of het voorbehoud te handhaven, te wijzigen of in te trekken. Bij gebreke van een kennisgeving van de betrokken Staat deelt de Secretaris-Generaal die Staat mee dat zijn verklaring of voorbehoud automatisch is verlengd voor een tijdvak van zes maanden. Indien de betrokken Staat voor het verstrijken van dat tijdvak geen kennis geeft van zijn besluit tot het handhaven of het wijzigen van de verklaring, vervalt de verklaring of het voorbehoud.   
3.  Indien een Partij overeenkomstig de artikelen 36 en 37 een verklaring aflegt of een voorbehoud maakt, geeft zij voor de verlenging of op verzoek uitleg aan de GRECO over de gronden die de handhaving rechtvaardigen.
