####Vereenvoudiging van formaliteiten

### Artikel  8  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij brengt de douaneformaliteiten vereist in verband met de faciliteiten van deze Overeenkomst tot een minimum terug. Alle voorschriften dienaangaande worden zo spoedig mogelijk bekendgemaakt.  

### Artikel  9  

1.  Indien een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tot nakoming van de voorwaarden verbonden aan de toekenning van de faciliteiten van deze Overeenkomst zekerheidstelling eist, mag deze zekerheid het bedrag van de te heffen rechten bij invoer met niet meer dan 10% te boven gaan.   
2.  Deze Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal evenwel ernstig overwegen, om in alle gevallen waar dit mogelijk is, een algemene zekerheidstelling door de organisatoren van de manifestatie of door een andere door de douaneautoriteiten erkende persoon te aanvaarden in plaats van de individuele zekerheidstelling die volgens het eerste lid van dit artikel kan worden geëist.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  Verificatie en vrijmaking bij invoer of bij wederuitvoer van goederen die zullen worden of zijn tentoongesteld of gebruikt op een manifestatie, worden waar mogelijk en wenselijk, verricht ter plaatse van die manifestatie.   
2.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij zal in de gevallen waarin zij zulks wenselijk acht in verband met de belangrijkheid en de omvang van de manifestatie, ernstig overwegen om voor een redelijke tijdsduur een douanekantoor te vestigen ter plaatse waar de manifestatie in haar gebied wordt gehouden.   
3.  Goederen waarvoor tijdelijke invoer is toegestaan mogen in één of meer zendingen weder worden uitgevoerd langs ieder douanekantoor dat daartoe is opengesteld, ook als dit kantoor een ander is dan het kantoor van invoer, tenzij de invoerder zich, teneinde van een vereenvoudigde procedure gebruik te kunnen maken, verplicht heeft de goederen weder uit te voeren langs het kantoor van invoer.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Algemene bepalingen

Produkten die tijdens de manifestatie uit tijdelijk ingevoerde goederen verkregen worden uitsluitend als gevolg van de demonstratie van tentoongestelde machines en apparaten, zijn onderworpen aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  12  

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst bevatten minimumfaciliteiten en beletten niet de toepassing van ruimere faciliteiten die bepaalde Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen toestaan of in de toekomst eventueel zullen toestaan, hetzij unilateraal, hetzij krachtens bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  13  

Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst kunnen de gebieden van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die een douane-unie of een economische unie vormen worden beschouwd als één gebied.  

### Artikel  14  

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst beletten niet de toepassing van: 

a. nationale of op overeenkomst berustende bepalingen, andere dan douanebepalingen, betreffende de organisatie van manifestaties;  

b. verboden en beperkingen opgelegd in nationale regelingen op grond van overwegingen van openbare zedelijkheid of orde, openbare veiligheid, hygiëne of volksgezondheid, diergeneeskundige of planteziektekundige overwegingen of wel om redenen van bescherming van octrooien, fabrieks- en handelsmerken, auteursrechten en kopijrechten.    

### Artikel  15  

Elke inbreuk op de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, elke verwisseling, valse verklaring of handeling, die tot gevolg heeft dat een persoon of een voorwerp ten onrechte de voordelen geniet van de in deze Overeenkomst neergelegde regelen stelt de overtreder in het land waar het strafbare feit is begaan bloot aan de straffen voorzien in de wetgeving van dat land en aan de betaling van de verschuldigde rechten bij invoer.
