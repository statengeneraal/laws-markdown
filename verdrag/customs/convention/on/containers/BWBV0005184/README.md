### Article  5  

1.  Component parts imported for the repair of a particular container already temporarily imported shall be admitted temporarily free of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions.   
2.

### Annex  1  

####REGULATIONS ON TECHNICAL CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO CONTAINERS WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED FOR TRANSPORT UNDER CUSTOMS SEAL

The conditions on which containers may be approved for the purpose of transport under Customs seal shall be as follows:    

### Article  1  

####General

1.  The container shall be durably marked with the name and address of its owner, with particulars of its tare and with identification marks and numbers. It shall be constructed and equipped in such a manner that: <sup> 1)  It is not necessary to show the full name and address of well-known railway administrations.  </sup> 

(a) Customs seals can be simple and effectively affixed thereto;  

(b) No goods can be removed from or introduced into the sealed part of the container without obvious damage to it or without breaking the seals;  

(c) It contains no spaces where goods may be hidden.     
2.  The container shall be so constructed that all spaces in the form of compartments, receptacles or other recesses which are capable of holding goods are readily accessible for Customs inspection.   
3.  Should any empty spaces be formed by the different layers of the sides, floor and roof of the container, the inside surface shall be firmly fixed, solid and unbroken and incapable of being dismantled without leaving obvious traces.   
4.  Containers to be approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Annex 2, paragraph 1, shall have on one of their outside walls a frame to hold the certificate of approval, which shall be covered on both sides by transparent plastic sheets hermetically sealed together. This frame shall be so designed as to protect the certificate of approval and to make it impossible to extract the certificate without breaking the seal that will be affixed in order to prevent the removal of the certificate; it shall also adequately protect the seal.   

### Article  2  

####Structure of container

1.  The sides, floor and roof of the container shall be constructed of plates, boards or panels of sufficient strength, of adequate thickness, and welded, riveted, grooved or jointed in such a way as not to leave any gaps in the structure through which access to the contents can be obtained. The various parts shall fit each other exactly and be so arranged that it is impossible either to move or remove them without leaving visible traces or damaging the Customs seals.   
2.  Essential joints, such as bolts, rivets, etc., shall be seated on the outside, protrude on the inside and be bolted, riveted or welded in a satisfactory manner. If the bolts holding the essential parts of the sides, floor and roof are seated on the outside, the other bolts may be seated on the inside, provided that the nut is properly welded on the outside and is not covered with non-transparent paint. However, by analogy with provisions regarding railway wagons, the following conditions shall apply to containers conveyed exclusively by rail under Customs seal: essential joints, such as bolts, rivets, etc., shall, where practicable, be seated on the outside, and shall be bolted, riveted or welded in a satisfactory manner. Where it is necessary for bolts to be seated on the inside with securing nuts on the outside, the bolt ends shall be riveted or welded over the nuts.   
3.  Apertures for ventilation shall be allowed provided their longest side does not exceed 400 mm. If they permit direct access to the interior of the container, they shall be covered with metal gauze or perforated metal screens (maximum dimension of holes: 3 mm. in both cases) and protected by welded metal lattice-work (maximum dimension of holes: 10 mm.). If they do not permit direct access to the interior of the container (for example, by means of multiple-bend air ducts), they shall be provided with the same protective devices but the dimensions of the holes may be increased to 10 mm. and 20 mm. respectively (instead of 3 mm. and 10 mm.). It shall not be possible to remove these devices from outside the container without leaving visible traces. Metal gauze shall be of wire at least 1 mm. in diameter and so made that single strands cannot be pushed together and that the size of individual holes cannot be increased without leaving visible traces.   
4.  Apertures for drainage shall be allowed provided their longest side does not exceed 35 mm. They shall be covered with metal gauze or perforated metal screens (maximum dimension of holes: 3 mm. in both cases) protected by welded metal lattice-work (maximum dimension of holes: 10 mm.). It shall not be possible to remove these devices from outside the container without leaving visible traces.   

### Article  3  

####Closing systems

1.  Doors and all other closing systems of containers shall be fitted with a device which shall permit simple and effective Customs sealing. This device shall either be welded to the sides of doors where these are of metal, or secured by at least two bolts, riveted or welded to the nuts on the inside.   
2.  Hinges shall be so made and fitted that doors and other closing systems cannot be lifted off the hinge-pins, once shut; the screws, bolts, hinge-pins and other fasteners shall be welded to the outer parts of the hinges. These requirements shall be waived, however, where the doors and other closing systems have a locking device inaccessible from the outside which, once it is applied, prevents the doors from being lifted off the hinge-pins.   
3.  Doors shall be so constructed as to cover all interstices and ensure complete and effective closure.   
4.  Containers shall be provided with a satisfactory device for protecting the Customs seal, or shall be so constructed that the Customs seal is adequately protected.   

### Article  4  

####Containers for special use

1.  The foregoing conditions shall apply to insulated and refrigerator containers, tank containers, furniture containers and to containers specially built for air transport in so far as they are not incompatible with the technical requirements which such containers must fulfil in accordance with their use.   
2.  The flanges (filler caps), drain cocks and manholes of tank containers shall be so constructed as to allow simple and effective Customs sealing.   

### Article  5  

####Folding or collapsible containers

Folding or collapsible containers are subject to the same conditions as non-folding or non-collapsible containers, provided that the locking devices enabling them to be folded or collapsed allow of Customs sealing and that no part of such containers can be moved without breaking the seals.  

### Article  6  

####Transitional provisions

The following dispensations shall be allowed until 31 December 1960: 

(a) The protection of apertures for ventilation and of apertures for drainage, by welded metal lattice-work (article 2, paragraphs 3 and 4) shall not be obligatory, except in the case of ventilation apertures fitted with multiple-bend air ducts;  

(b) The device for protecting the Customs seal (article 3, paragraph 4) shall not be obligatory.    

### Annex  2  

####PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROVAL AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONTAINERS COMPLYING WITH THE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE REGULATIONS CONTAINED IN ANNEX 1

### 1  

The procedure for the approval of containers shall be as follows: 

(a) Containers may be approved by the competent authorities of the country in which the owner is resident or established or by those of the country where the container is used for the first time for transport under Customs seal.  

(b) The date and serial number of the approval decision must be specified.  

(c) A certificate of approval conforming to the attached standard form shall be issued for approved containers. This certificate shall be printed in the language of the country of issue and in French; and the various headings shall be numbered, so that the text may be more readily understood in the other languages. The certificate shall be covered on both sides by hermetically sealed transparent plastic sheets.  

(d) The certificate shall accompany the container; it shall be inserted in the protective frame mentioned in article 1, paragraph 4, of Annex 1 and so sealed that it cannot be extracted from the protective frame without breaking the seal.  

(e) Containers shall be produced every two years to the competent authorities for purposes of inspection and renewal of approval where appropriate.  

(f) Approval shall lapse if the essential features of the container are altered or on change of ownership.    

### 2  

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, containers conveyed only by rail which are owned or registered by a railway administration which is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC), may, unless the competent authorities of the country of that railway administration require otherwise, be approved and periodically inspected by the said administration, and the fact that such containers comply with the technical conditions prescribed in the regulations shall be indicated by the sign   ![10000054641](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054641)
on the outside of containers. No certificate of approval shall be required for containers bearing this sign.

### Protocol  

####of signature

At the time of signing the Convention of this day's date the undersigned, being duly authorized, make the following declarations: 

1. That the inclusion, for the purpose of calculating duties and taxes, of the weight or value of temporarily imported containers in the weight or value of the goods they contain conflicts with the principle of the temporary admission of containers free of import duties and import taxes. The addition of a legally determined tare weight factor to the weight of goods conveyed in containers is permissible if it is made in virtue of the absence of packing or of the nature of the packing, and not in virtue of the fact that the goods are conveyed by container.  

2. The terms of this Convention shall not preclude the application of national or conventional provisions, not of a Customs nature, regulating the use of containers.  

3. The terms of this Convention set out minimum facilities. It is not the intention of the Contracting Parties to restrict wider facilities which are granted or may be granted by certain of them in respect of containers. On the contrary, the Contracting Parties will endeavour to grant the maximum possible facilities.     
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto, have signed this Protocol. DONE at Geneva, this eighteenth day of May one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six, in a single copy in the English and French languages, each text being equally authentic.

2.  De vervangen onderdelen welke niet weder worden uitgevoerd zijn onderworpen aan de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer, tenzij zij overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het betrokken land vrij van alle kosten ten gunste van de Schatkist worden afgestaan of wel onder ambtelijk toezicht op kosten van belanghebbenden worden vernietigd.   

### Artikel  6  

De uitvoeringsvoorschriften betreffende de tijdelijke invoer van containers en losse onderdelen met vrijstelling van rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer worden vastgesteld door de in het gebied van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van kracht zijnde bepalingen.

### Artikel  8  

De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen ernaar streven geen douaneformaliteiten in te stellen, die de ontwikkeling van het internationale vervoer met containers zouden kunnen belemmeren.

Elke inbreuk op de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, elke verwisseling, valse verklaring of handeling, die tot gevolg heeft dat ten aanzien van een persoon of een voorwerp de in deze Overeenkomst neergelegde regelingen ten onrechte worden toegepast, stelt de overtreder in het land waar het strafbare feit is begaan bloot aan de straffen voorzien in de wetgeving van dat land.  

### Artikel  10  

Geen enkele bepaling van deze Overeenkomst zal de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen welke een douane-unie of een economische unie vormen kunnen beletten, bijzondere bepalingen vast te stellen, welke van toepassing zijn op personen die wonen of gevestigd zijn in de landen die deel uitmaken van die unie.  

### Artikel  11  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is bevoegd het voorrecht van tijdelijke invoer met vrijstelling van rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer en zonder toepassing van invoerverboden en invoerbeperkingen te weigeren of in te trekken ten aanzien van containers welke worden gebruikt om goederen te laden in het land waar de container is ingevoerd ten einde deze goederen elders in dat land uit te laden, ook indien zulks slechts af en toe zou plaatsvinden.

### Bijlage  1  

####REGLEMENT BETREFFENDE DE TECHNISCHE VOORWAARDEN, VAN TOEPASSING OP CONTAINERS WELKE KUNNEN WORDEN TOEGELATEN TOT VERVOER ONDER DOUANEVERZEGELING

Om te kunnen worden goedgekeurd met het oog op vervoer onder douaneverzegeling, moeten de containers aan de volgende voorwaarden voldoen:    

### Artikel  1  

####Algemeen

1.  Op de container moeten de naam en het adres van de eigenaar, alsmede het gewicht en de herkenningstekens en herkenningsnummers op duurzame wijze zijn aangeduid . De container moet zodanig zijn gebouwd en ingericht, dat: <sup> 1)  Het is niet noodzakelijk de volledige naam en het adres van algemeen bekende spoorwegadministraties te vermelden.  </sup> 

a) hij op eenvoudige en doeltreffende wijze door de douane kan worden verzegeld;  

b) geen goederen aan het verzegelde gedeelte van de container kunnen worden onttrokken of er worden ingebracht zonder braak welke zichtbare sporen nalaat, of zonder verbreking van de verzegeling;  

c) geen ruimte aanwezig is waarin goederen kunnen worden verborgen.     
2.  De container moet zodanig zijn gebouwd, dat alle ruimten welke goederen kunnen bevatten gemakkelijk door de douane kunnen worden gevisiteerd.   
3.  Indien ledige ruimten zouden bestaan tussen de verschillende schotten welke de wanden, de vloer en het dak van de container vormen, moet de binnenbekleding vast bevestigd, volledig en aaneengesloten zijn en bovendien zo zijn aangebracht dat zij niet kan worden verwijderd zonder zichtbare sporen na te laten.   
4.  Van de containers, goed te keuren volgens de in paragraaf 1 van Bijlage 2 vermelde procedure, moet één van de buitenwanden zijn voorzien van een raam ter omlijsting van het certificaat van goedkeuring. Dit certificaat moet geheel omgeven zijn door een hermetisch gesloten omhulsel van doorzichtige, plastische stof. Het raam moet zodanig zijn ontworpen, dat het certificaat beschermd wordt en onmogelijk kan worden verwijderd zonder verbreking van de verzegeling welke is aangebracht om te verhinderen dat bedoeld certificaat wordt weggenomen. Dit raam dient eveneens deze verzegeling op doeltreffende wijze te beschermen.   

### Artikel  2  

####Bouw van de container

1.  De wanden, de vloer en het dak van de container moeten vervaardigd zijn van platen, planken of panelen, welke voldoende stevig en van passende dikte zijn en op zodanige wijze zijn gelast, geklonken, verbonden door messing en groef of samengevoegd, dat er geen spleet overblijft waardoor toegang tot de laadruimte kan worden verkregen. Deze samenstellende delen moeten nauwkeurig in elkaar passen en zodanig zijn verbonden dat geen enkel ervan kan worden verplaatst of weggenomen zonder zichtbare sporen van braak achter te laten of zonder de douaneverzegeling te beschadigen.   
2.  De bevestigingsmiddelen van wezenlijk belang zoals bouten, klinknagels, enz., moeten van buitenaf zijn aangebracht, aan de binnenkant uitsteken en op deugdelijke wijze zijn vastgeschroefd, geklonken of gelast. Onder voorbehoud dat de bouten welke de van wezenlijk belang zijnde delen van de wanden, de vloer en het dak verbinden van buitenaf zijn aangebracht, kunnen de overige bouten van binnenaf zijn aangebracht, mits de moer aan de buitenkant deugdelijk is gelast en niet met een ondoorzichtige verflaag is bedekt. Naar analogie van de voorschriften betreffende spoorwegwagons zijn evenwel de volgende bepalingen van toepassing op containers welke uitsluitend per spoor onder douaneverzegeling worden vervoerd: de bevestigingsmiddelen van wezenlijk belang zoals bouten, klinknagels enz., zullen waar dit doenlijk is van buitenaf worden aangebracht en op deugdelijke wijze zijn vastgeschroefd, geklonken of gelast. Indien het noodzakelijk is dat de bouten van binnenaf zijn aangebracht met de moeren aan de buitenkant, zullen de uiteinden van de bouten op de moer worden geklonken of gelast.   
3.  Ventilatieopeningen zijn toegelaten onder voorwaarde, dat de grootste afmeting 400 mm niet te boven gaat. Indien zij rechtstreeks toegang verschaffen tot de laadruimte van de container, moeten zij voorzien zijn van metaalgaas of van een doorboorde metalen plaat (maximum afmeting van de gaten in beide gevallen: 3 mm), beschermd door een gelast metalen traliewerk (maximum afmeting van de openingen: 10 mm). Indien zij niet rechtstreeks toegang verschaffen tot de laadruimte van de container (bijvoorbeeld omdat een systeem van meermalen gebogen buizen is gebezigd), moeten zij op dezelfde wijze zijn beschermd, maar de afmetingen van de gaten en openingen mogen onderscheidenlijk 10 mm en 20 mm bedragen (in plaats van 3 mm en 10 mm). Het moet niet mogelijk zijn het gaas, de plaat of het traliewerk van buitenaf te verwijderen zonder zichtbare sporen na te laten. Het metaalgaas moet uit draden van ten minste 1 mm doorsnede zijn samengesteld en zodanig zijn vervaardigd dat de draden niet naar elkaar toe kunnen worden gebracht en het onmogelijk is de gaten te vergroten zonder zichtbare sporen na te laten.   
4.  Afvloeiingsopeningen zijn toegestaan onder voorwaarde dat de grootste afmeting 35 mm niet te boven gaat. Zij moeten voorzien zijn van metaalgaas of van een doorboorde metalen plaat (maximum afmeting van de gaten in beide gevallen: 3 mm), beschermd door een gelast metalen traliewerk (maximum afmeting van de openingen: 10 mm). Het moet niet mogelijk zijn het gaas, de plaat of het traliewerk van buitenaf te verwijderen zonder zichtbare sporen na te laten.   

### Artikel  3  

####Systemen van sluiting

1.  De deuren en alle andere afsluitingen van de container moeten zodanig zijn ingericht, dat een douaneverzegeling op eenvoudige en doeltreffende wijze kan worden aangebracht. De inrichting daartoe zal ofwel aan de deuren gelast moeten zijn indien deze van metaal zijn, ofwel bevestigd moeten zijn met ten minste twee bouten, die aan de binnenkant aan de moeren moeten zijn vastgeklonken of gelast.   
2.  De scharnieren dienen zodanig te zijn vervaardigd en bevestigd, dat de deuren en andere afsluitingen, nadat zij gesloten zijn, niet uit de hengsels kunnen worden gelicht; schroeven, bouten, pinnen en andere bevestigingsmiddelen moeten aan de buitenkant aan de scharnieren zijn gelast. Deze vereisten gelden evenwel niet, indien de deuren en andere afsluitingen zijn voorzien van een niet van buitenaf toegankelijke sluitinrichting waardoor de deuren, nadat die inrichting is gesloten, niet meer uit de hengsels kunnen worden gelicht.   
3.  De deuren moeten zodanig zijn geconstrueerd, dat zij alle reten afdekken en een volledige en doeltreffende sluiting verzekeren.   
4.  De container moet zijn voorzien van een inrichting ter bescherming van de douaneverzegeling of moet zodanig zijn gebouwd, dat de douaneverzegeling voldoende is beschermd.   

### Artikel  4  

####Containers voor speciale doeleinden

1.  Bovenstaande voorschriften zijn van toepassing op warmteisolerende containers, op koel-, vries-, tank- en verhuiscontainers en op containers, welke speciaal gebouwd zijn voor het luchtvervoer, voor zover deze voorschriften verenigbaar zijn met de technische eisen, waaraan deze containers in verband met hun bestemming moeten voldoen.   
2.  Sluitdeksels, kranen en mangaten van tankcontainers moeten zodanig zijn ingericht, dat een eenvoudige en doeltreffende verzegeling door de douane mogelijk is.   

### Artikel  5  

####Opvouwbare containers en containers welke uit elkaar kunnen worden genomen

Opvouwbare containers en containers welke uit elkaar kunnen worden genomen zijn onderworpen aan dezelfde voorwaarden als andere containers, mits de sluitinrichting, die het opvouwen of het demonteren van de containers mogelijk maakt, door de douane kan worden verzegeld en geen enkel onderdeel van deze containers kan worden verplaatst of verschoven zonder dat de verzegeling wordt verbroken.  

### Artikel  6  

####Overgangsbepalingen

De volgende afwijkingen zullen worden toegestaan tot en met 31 december 1960: 

a) het metalen traliewerk tot bescherming van de ventilatieopeningen, tenzij voor de ventilatie een systeem van meermalen gebogen buizen is gebezigd, en van de afvloeiingsopeningen (artikel 2, leden 3 en 4) is niet vereist;  

b) de inrichting tot bescherming van de douaneverzegeling (artikel 3, lid 4) is niet vereist.    

### Bijlage  2  

####BEPALINGEN BETREFFENDE DE GOEDKEURING EN DE VASTSTELLING VAN DE IDENTITEIT VAN CONTAINERS WELKE VOLDOEN AAN DE TECHNISCHE VOORWAARDEN, VERMELD IN HET IN BIJLAGE 1 OPGENOMEN REGLEMENT

### 1  

De goedkeuringsprocedure is de volgende: 

a) De containers kunnen worden goedgekeurd door de bevoegde autoriteiten van het land waar de eigenaar woont of gevestigd is, of door die van het land waar de container voor de eerste maal tot vervoer onder douaneverzegeling wordt aangewend.  

b) De beslissing tot goedkeuring moet gedateerd zijn en een volgnummer dragen.  

c) Voor goedgekeurde containers wordt een certificaat van goedkeuring afgegeven volgens het hierbij gevoegde model. Dit certificaat moet worden gedrukt in de taal van het land waar het wordt verstrekt en in het Frans; de verschillende rubrieken moeten genummerd zijn, zodat de tekst gemakkelijker in de andere talen kan worden begrepen. Het certificaat moet geheel omgeven zijn door een hermetisch gesloten omhulsel van doorzichtige plastische stof.  

d) Het certificaat moet bij de container aanwezig zijn; het moet geplaatst zijn achter het beschermende raam, bedoeld in artikel 1, lid 4, van Bijlage 1, hetwelk zodanig verzegeld moet zijn, dat het certificaat onmogelijk kan worden verwijderd zonder verbreking van de verzegeling.  

e) De containers moeten elke twee jaar aan de bevoegde autoriteiten worden aangeboden voor onderzoek en voor eventuele vernieuwing van de goedkeuring.  

f) De goedkeuring vervalt, indien de essentiële kenmerken van de container wijziging ondergaan, of bij verandering van eigenaar.    

### 2  

Onverminderd het bepaalde in lid 1 hierboven mogen de goedkeuring en het periodieke onderzoek van containers welke uitsluitend per spoor worden vervoerd en toebehoren aan of ingeschreven zijn bij een spoorwegadministratie die lid is van de Internationale Spoorwegunie (U.I.C.) door deze administratie zelf plaatsvinden, tenzij de bevoegde autoriteiten van het land van genoemde administratie anders beslissen. Ten blijke dat dergelijke containers voldoen aan de   ![10000054986](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054986)
voor op een van de buitenwanden van de container. Voor aldus gemerkte containers zullen geen certificaten van goedkeuring worden verstrekt.

### Protocol  

####van ondertekening

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst van deze datum leggen de ondergetekenden, daartoe behoorlijk gevolmachtigd, de volgende verklaringen af:    

### 1  

Het beginsel van de tijdelijke invoer van containers met vrijstelling van rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer verzet zich ertegen, dat voor de berekening van de rechten en heffingen op de goederen het gewicht of de waarde van deze goederen wordt vermeerderd met het gewicht of de waarde van de tijdelijk ingevoerde container. De vermeerdering van het gewicht van de in containers vervoerde goederen met een wettelijk vastgesteld percentage van het gewicht is geoorloofd, indien dit geschiedt wegens de afwezigheid van verpakking of in verband met de aard van de verpakking en niet wegens het feit dat de goederen worden vervoerd met containers.  

### 2  

De Overeenkomst doet geen afbreuk aan de toepassing van nationale of in overeenkomsten neergelegde bepalingen, andere dan douanebepalingen, welke het gebruik van containers regelen.  

### 3  

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst behelzen minimumfaciliteiten. Het ligt niet in de bedoeling van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen beperkingen aan te brengen in verdergaande faciliteiten welke enkele hunner met betrekking tot containers toestaan of zouden kunnen toestaan. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zullen integendeel streven naar het verlenen van de ruimst mogelijke faciliteiten.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekenden, daartoe behoorlijk gevolmachtigd, dit Protocol hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te Genève, de achttiende mei negentienhonderd zesenvijftig, in één exemplaar, in de Engelse en de Franse taal, zijnde beide teksten gelijkelijk authentiek.
