### CHAPTER  V  

####Conditions of temporary importation

### Article  12  

Without prejudice to the application of the provisions of national legislations enabling the Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties to refuse to allow vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation papers to be driven by persons who have been guilty of serious offences against the Customs or fiscal laws or regulations of the country of temporary importation, vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation papers may be driven by persons duly authorized by the holders of the papers. The Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to require evidence that such persons have been duly authorized by the holders of the papers; if this evidence does not appear sufficient, the Customs authorities may refuse use of these vehicles in their country under cover of the papers.  

### Article  13  

1.  Vehicles mentioned in temporary importation papers shall be re-exported in the same general state, except for wear and tear, within the period of validity of such papers.   
2.  Evidence of re-exportation shall be provided by the exit visa properly appended to the temporary importation papers by the Customs authorities of the country into which the vehicle was temporarily imported.   
3.  Each Contracting Party shall have the right to deny the benefit of temporary importation without payment of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions to, or to withdraw that benefit from, vehicles which are used, even occasionally, for the purpose of picking up passengers or goods within the frontiers of the country into which the vehicle is imported, for deposit within those frontiers.   
4.  A hired vehicle temporarily imported under the terms of this Convention shall not be re-hired in the country of temporary importation to any persons other than the persons who hired it originally, and the Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to require that such a vehicle shall be re-exported when the transport operations for which it has been temporarily imported have been completed.   

### Article  14  

1.  Notwithstanding the requirement of re-exportation laid down in article 13, the re-exportation of badly damaged vehicles shall not be required, in the case of duly authenticated accidents, provided that the vehicles: 

(a) Are subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable; or  

(b) are abandoned free of all expenses to the Exchequer of the country into which they were imported temporarily, in which case the holder of the temporary importation papers shall be exempt from import duties and import taxes; or  

(c) Are destroyed, under official supervision, at the expense of the parties concerned, any salvaged parts and materials being subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable, as the Customs authorities may require.     
2.  When a vehicle temporarily imported cannot be re-exported as a result of a seizure, other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, the requirement of re-exportation within the period of validity of the temporary importation papers shall be suspended for the duration of the seizure.   
3.  The Customs authorities shall notify, so far as possible, to the guaranteeing association, seizures made by or on behalf of those Customs authorities of vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation papers guaranteed by that association and shall advise it of the measures they intend to take.   
4.  When the vehicle or the object listed in the papers are either lost or stolen during the course of the seizure other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, no import duties or import taxes can be levied against the holder of the temporary importation papers, who should submit evidence of seizure to the Customs authorities.   

### Article  15  

Persons entitled to temporary importation facilities may, during the period of validity of temporary importation papers, import the vehicles covered by those papers as often as necessary, on condition that they have each passage (entry and exit) established by a visa of the Customs officers concerned if the Customs authorities so require. Temporary importation papers may however be made valid for a single journey only.  

### Article  16  

When temporary importation papers without detachable vouchers for each passage are used, the visas given by the Customs officers between the first entry and the final exit are provisional. Nevertheless, when the last visa is a provisional exit visa, it will be admitted as proof of the reexportation of the vehicle or component parts temporarily imported.  

### Article  17  

When temporary importation papers with a detachable voucher for each passage are used, each entry visa implies the passing of the document by the Customs authorities and each subsequent exit visa constitutes its final discharge, except as provided in article 18.  

### Article  18  

When the Customs authorities of a country have finally and unconditionally discharged temporary importation papers they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of import duties and import taxes, unless the certificate of discharge was obtained improperly or fraudulently.  

### Article  19  

Visas on temporary importation papers used under the conditions laid down in this Convention shall not be subject to the payment of charges for Customs attendance provided such visas are issued at a Custom office or post during authorized hours.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####Extension of validity and renewal of temporary importation papers

### Article  20  

The lack of proof of re-exportation within the time allowed of vehicles temporarily imported shall be disregarded when the vehicles are presented to the Customs authorities for re-exportation within fourteen days from the expiry of the temporary entry deadline for the vehicles and satisfactory explanations of the delay are given.  

### Article  21  

Each of the Contracting Parties shall recognize as valid extensions of validity of *carnets de passages en douane* granted by another Contracting Party in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex 3 to this Convention.  

### Article  22  

1.  Requests for extension of validity of temporary importation papers shall be presented to the competent Customs authorities before the expiry of the period of validity of these papers, unless this is rendered impossible by *force majeure.* If the temporary importation papers have been issued by an authorized association, the request for extension shall be made by the association which guarantees the papers.   
2.  Extensions of time necessary for the re-exportation of vehicles or component parts imported temporarily shall be granted when the persons concerned can establish to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that they are prevented by *force majeure* from re-exporting the said vehicles or component parts within the time allowed.   
3.  The validity of temporary importation papers can only be extended once for not more than one year. After this period, a new carnet must be issued and delivered in replacement of the former carnet.   

### Article  23  

Each of the Contracting Parties shall, unless the conditions of temporary admission are no longer satisfied, authorize, subject to whatever measures of control it may consider necessary, the renewal of temporary importation papers issued by the authorized associations and relating to vehicles or component parts temporarily imported into its territory. Requests for renewal shall be presented by the guaranteeing association.  

### CHAPTER  VII  

####Regularization of temporary importation papers

### Article  24  

1.  If temporary importation papers have not been regularly discharged, the Customs authorities of the country of importation shall (whether the papers have expired or not) accept as evidence of re-exportation of the vehicle or component parts the presentation of a certificate based on the standard form shown in Annex 4 to this Convention, issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer, etc.), attesting the facts that the vehicle or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside the country of importation. As an alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the vehicle or component parts are outside the country of temporary importation. In the case of papers, other than the *carnets de passages en douane*, which have not expired, the papers shall be produced at the same time as the evidence referred to above. In the case of *carnets* the Customs authorities shall accept, as evidence of re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts, the visas entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries subsequently visited.   
2.  In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of temporary importation papers not regularly discharged but relating to vehicles or component parts which have been re-exported, the Customs authorities of the country of importation shall accept as proof of re-exportation the presentation of certificates based on the standard form shown in Annex 4 to this Convention issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer, etc.), attesting the facts that the vehicles or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside the country of importation after the date of expiry of the papers. As an alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the vehicle or component parts are outside the country of temporary importation.   
3.  In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of *carnets de passages en douane* while vehicles or component parts to which they refer are in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, the Customs authorities of that Party shall, at the request of the association concerned, accept replacement documents, the validity of which shall expire on the date of expiry of the validity of the *carnets* which they replace. This acceptance will annul the previous acceptance of the *carnets* destroyed, lost or stolen. In case of the misuse of a *carnet* after cancellation by the Customs authorities and the issuing association, the latter cannot be held responsible for import duties and import taxes payable. If, instead of replacement documents, export licences or similar documents are issued for the re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts, the exit visas on these licences or documents shall be considered as sufficient proof of re-exportation.   
4.  If vehicles are stolen after having been re-exported from the country of temporary importation, without the exit having been regularly endorsed on the temporary importation papers and in the absence of entry visas on the papers entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries subsequently visited, the papers may nevertheless be regularized provided that the guaranteeing association furnishes the papers together with such evidence of theft as may be considered sufficient. If the temporary importation papers have not expired, the Customs authorities may require their surrender.   

### Article  25  

In the cases referred to in article 24, the Customs authorities shall have the right to charge a regularization fee.  

### Article  25 bis  

The competent customs authorities shall not require payment of import duties and taxes where it is proved to their satisfaction that a vehicle imported under cover of temporary importation papers can no longer be re-exported because it has been destroyed or irrecoverably lost for reasons of force majeure, in particular on account of acts of war, riots or natural disasters.  

### Article  26  

Customs authorities shall not have the right to require from the guaranteeing association payment of import duties and import taxes on vehicles or component parts temporarily imported when the nondischarge of the temporary importation papers has not been notified to the guaranteeing association within one year of the date of expiry of the validity of those papers. The Customs authorities shall provide the guaranteeing associations details of the amount of import duties and import taxes within one year of the notification of the non-discharge. The guaranteeing associations’ liability for these sums shall cease if such information is not furnished within this one-year period.  

### Article  27  

1.  The guaranteeing associations shall have a period of one year from the date of notification of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers in which to furnish proof of the re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts in question under the conditions laid down in this Convention. Nevertheless, this period can come into force only as of the date of expiry of the temporary importation papers. If the Customs authorites contest the validity of the proof provided they must so inform the guarantees within a period not exceeding one year.   
2.  If such proof is not furnished within the time limit allowed, the guaranteeing association shall deposit or pay provisionally within a maximum period of three months the import duties and import taxes payable. This deposit or payment shall become final after a period of one year from the date of the deposit or provisional payment. During the latter period, the guaranteeing association may still avail itself of the facilities provided by the preceding paragraph with a view to repayment of the sums deposited or paid.   
3.  For countries whose regulations do not provide for the deposit or provisional payment of import duties and import taxes, payments made in conformity with the provisions of the preceding paragraph will be regarded as final, it being understood that the sums paid may be refunded when the conditions laid down in this article are fulfilled.   
4.  In the case of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers, the guaranteeing association shall not be required to pay a sum greater than the total of the import duties and import taxes applicable to the vehicles or component parts not re-exported, together with interest if applicable.   

### Article  28  

The provisions of this Convention do not affect the right of the Contracting Parties, in the event of fraud, contravention or abuse, to take proceedings against holders of, or the persons using, temporary importation papers, for the recovery of the import duties and import taxes and also to impose any penalties to which such persons have rendered themselves liable. In such cases, the guaranteeing associations shall lend their assistance to the Customs authorities.  

### CHAPTER  VIII  

####Miscellaneous provisions

### Article  29  

The Contracting Parties shall endeavour not to introduce Customs procedures which might have the effect of impeding the development of international commercial road traffic.  

### Article  30  

In order to expedite Customs procedures contiguous Contracting Parties shall endeavour to place their respective Customs offices and posts close together and to keep them open during the same hours.  

### Article  31

### Article  32  

Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Contracting Parties which form a Customs or economic union from enacting special provisions applicable to undertakings operating from the countries forming that union.  

### Article  32 bis  

This Convention shall not prevent the application of greater facilities which Contracting Parties grant or may wish to grant, either by unilateral provisions or in virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreements, provided such facilities do not impede the application of the provisions of this Convention.

### Annex  3  

####EXTENSION OF VALIDITY OF THE “CARNET DE PASSAGES EN DOUANE”

### 1  

The stamp for extension of validity shall conform to the model contained in this annex. The stamp shall be drawn up in English or French. The inscribed wording may be repeated in another language.  

### 2  

The following procedure shall be observen by the person requesting the extension and by the guaranteeing association dealing with the reques: 

(a) As soon as the holder of a *carnet de passages en douane* realizes that he is obliged to request an extension of the period of validity of the document, he sends to the quaranteeing association the *carnet* and a request for extension, indicating the circumstances which oblige him to make the request. He will submit with his request, as supporting evidence, such papers as a medical certificate, a statement from the garage repairing his vehicle, or any other authentic document showing that the delay in question is caused by *force majeure*.  

(b) If the guaranteeing association considers that the request for extension might be passed on to the Customs authorities, it stamps the cover of the *carnet de passages en douane* in the space specially reserved for this purpose.  

(c) In the left-hand side of the stamp the guaranteeing association fills in the date, in figures and words, until which the extension is requested. The President or representative of the association signs and the stamp of the association is affixed.  

(d) The length of the extension must not exceed a reasonable period necessary to complete the journey, and should not normally exceed three months from the previous date of expiry of the *carnet.*  

(e) The guaranteeing association then sends the *carnet* to the competent Customs authority of its country. The request made by the holder of the *carnet* and the supporting evidence are attached to the *carnet.*  

(f) The Customs authority decides whether the extension shall be granted. It may reduce the period of extension requested, or refuse to grant any extension. If it is granted, the competent Customs officer completes the stamp placed on the cover of the *carnet* by the guaranteeing association, by adding a serial or registry number, the place and date and his own official position. He then signs and adds the Customs stamp.  

(g) The *carnet* is then returned to the guaranteeing association, which in turn returns it to the person concerned.     ![10000054664](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054664)

Zonder toestemming van de douaneautoriteiten van het land van invoer is geen enkele wijziging toegestaan, nadat de documenten door die autoriteiten voor invoer zijn afgetekend.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Voorwaarden voor de tijdelijke invoer

### Artikel  12  

Onverminderd de toepassing van de bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving, krachtens welke de douaneautoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kunnen weigeren dat voertuigen waarvoor een document van tijdelijke invoer is afgegeven, worden bestuurd door personen die zich schuldig hebben gemaakt aan ernstige inbreuken op de douane- en fiscale wetten of reglementen van het land van tijdelijke invoer, mogen voertuigen welke onder dekking van documenten van tijdelijke invoer zijn toegelaten, worden bestuurd door personen die daartoe door de houders van deze documenten behoorlijk zijn gemachtigd. De douaneautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen hebben het recht bewijzen te vorderen, dat deze personen behoorlijk zijn gemachtigd door degene op wiens naam het document is gesteld; indien de verstrekte bewijzen hun niet voldoende voorkomen, kunnen de douaneautoriteiten weigeren dat de voertuigen in hun land worden gebruikt onder dekking van bedoelde documenten.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  De voertuigen vermeld in de documenten van tijdelijke invoer moeten, afgezien van de normale slijtage, in dezelfde staat weder worden uitgevoerd binnen de geldigheidsduur van die documenten.   
2.  Dat de wederuitvoer heeft plaatsgehad, blijkt uit de omstandigheid dat het document van tijdelijke invoer op regelmatige wijze voor uitvoer is afgetekend door de douaneautoriteiten van het land waar de voertuigen tijdelijk werden ingevoerd.   
3.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij is bevoegd het voorrecht van tijdelijke invoer met vrijstelling van rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer en zonder toepassing van invoerverboden en invoerbeperkingen te weigeren of in te trekken ten aanzien van vervoermiddelen welke worden gebruikt om reizigers op te nemen of goederen te laden in het land waar het voertuig is ingevoerd, ten einde die reizigers elders in dat land af te zetten of die goederen aldaar te lossen, ook indien zulks slechts af en toe zou plaats vinden.   
4.  Een gehuurd voertuig dat onder de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tijdelijk is ingevoerd, mag in het land van tijdelijke invoer niet opnieuw worden verhuurd aan een andere persoon dan de oorspronkelijke huurder, noch worden onderverhuurd en de douaneautoriteiten van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen hebben het recht te vorderen dat een dergelijk voertuig weder wordt uitgevoerd na beëindiging van de transportverrichtingen waarvoor het tijdelijk werd ingevoerd.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  De in artikel 13 neergelegde verplichting tot wederuitvoer geldt niet ten aanzien van voertuigen welke ernstig beschadigd zijn ten gevolge van een ongeval waarvan op afdoende wijze wordt aangetoond dat het heeft plaatsgehad, mits, al naar gelang de douaneautoriteiten zulks vorderen, de voertuigen: 

a) of wel worden onderworpen aan de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer verschuldigd;  

b)  de tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar;   

c) of wel op kosten van belanghebbenden onder ambtelijk toezicht worden vernietigd, in welk geval het afval en de overgebleven delen zijn onderworpen aan de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer verschuldigd.     
2.  Indien een voertuig dat tijdelijk is ingevoerd, niet weder kan worden uitgevoerd als gevolg van inbeslagneming of beslaglegging, anders dan op vordering van particulieren, wordt de verplichting tot wederuitvoer binnen de geldigheidsduur van het document van tijdelijke invoer opgeschort voor de duur van het beslag.   
3.  Van de gevallen waarin de douaneautoriteiten voertuigen waarvoor de aansprakelijke organisaties documenten van tijdelijke invoer hebben afgegeven, in beslag hebben genomen of hebben doen nemen, dan wel daarop beslag hebben gelegd of doen leggen, geven zij voor zover mogelijk kennis aan die organisaties. Zij doen voorts mededeling aan bedoelde organisaties van de maatregelen welke zij voornemens zijn te treffen.   
4.   De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.    

### Artikel  15  

Zij die aanspraak kunnen maken op de tijdelijke invoer, mogen binnen de geldigheidsduur van de documenten van tijdelijke invoer de daarin vermelde voertuigen invoeren zo vaak als nodig is, mits zij bij elke grensoverschrijding (binnenkomen en uitgaan) de documenten door de betrokken douaneambtenaren doen aftekenen voor zover de douaneautoriteiten zulks vorderen. Er kunnen echter documenten worden afgegeven voor één enkele reis.  

### Artikel  16  

Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van een document van tijdelijke invoer, dat niet is voorzien van stroken welke bij elke grensoverschrijding kunnen worden uitgescheurd, hebben de aftekening door de douane tussen de eerste binnenkomst en het laatste uitgaan een voorlopig karakter. Indien de laatste aftekening een voorlopige aftekening voor uitgaan is, wordt die aftekening niettemin aanvaard als bewijs van de wederuitvoer van het tijdelijk ingevoerde voertuig of de tijdelijk ingevoerde losse onderdelen.  

### Artikel  17  

Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van een document van tijdelijke invoer, dat voorzien is van stroken welke bij elke grensoverschrijding kunnen worden uitgescheurd, brengt elke bevinding van binnenkomst met zich mede dat het document door de douane voor invoer wordt afgetekend en wordt het document door iedere vaststelling van latere uitvoer definitief gezuiverd, onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 18.  

### Artikel  18  

Indien het document van tijdelijke invoer blijkens de daarop voorkomende aantekeningen van de douaneautoriteiten van een land definitief en zonder voorbehoud is gezuiverd, kunnen die autoriteiten de betaling van de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer niet meer vorderen van de aansprakelijke organisatie, tenzij de zuivering ten onrechte of op frauduleuze wijze werd verkregen.  

### Artikel  19  

Het aftekenen van documenten van tijdelijke invoer welke op de voet van deze Overeenkomst worden gebruikt, geeft geen aanleiding tot betaling van een vergoeding voor de verrichtingen van de douane, indien het aftekenen plaatsvindt op een douanekantoor of op een douanepost gedurende de uren van openstelling van dat kantoor of die post.

Indien het document van tijdelijke invoer is afgegeven door een gemachtigde organisatie, moet het verzoek om verlenging door de aansprakelijke organisatie worden ingediend.   
2.  Verlenging van de geldigheidsduur voor de tijd welke nodig is voor de wederuitvoer van de tijdelijk ingevoerde voertuigen of losse onderdelen, wordt toegestaan, indien de belanghebbenden ten genoegen van de douaneautoriteiten kunnen aantonen dat zij door overmacht verhinderd zijn bedoelde voertuigen of losse onderdelen binnen de gestelde termijn weder uit te voeren.   
3.   De tekst van de vertaling is niet beschikbaar.    

### Artikel  23  

Tenzij aan de voorwaarden voor tijdelijke invoer niet langer wordt voldaan, verleent elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, onverminderd zodanige controlemaatregelen als zij nodig oordeelt, machtiging tot vernieuwing van documenten van tijdelijke invoer welke zijn afgegeven door gemachtigde organisaties en betrekking hebben op tijdelijk in haar gebied ingevoerde voertuigen of losse onderdelen. De aanvraag om vernieuwing moet door de aansprakelijke organisatie worden ingediend.

Indien een voertuig is gestolen nadat het weder uit het land van invoer is uitgevoerd zonder dat van het uitgaan op regelmatige wijze aantekening is gesteld op het document van tijdelijke invoer en zonder dat het document door de douaneautoriteiten van de landen waar het voertuig vervolgens heeft gereden, voor invoer is afgetekend, kan het document niettemin worden geregulariseerd, mits het wordt overgelegd door de aansprakelijke organisatie en deze de diefstal voldoende aannemelijk maakt. Indien de geldigheidsduur van het document niet is verstreken, kunnen de douaneautoriteiten vorderen dat het wordt overgelegd.   

### Artikel  25  

De douaneautoriteiten behouden zich het recht voor in de gevallen bedoeld in artikel 24 kosten voor regularisatie te heffen.  

### Artikel  25 bis  

De bevoegde douaneautoriteiten vorderen geen betaling van invoerrechten en -heffingen, indien ten hunne genoege is aangetoond dat een voertuig, ingevoerd onder dekking van documenten van tijdelijke invoer, niet weder kan worden uitgevoerd omdat het vernietigd of onherstelbaar verloren is om redenen van overmacht, in het bijzonder door toedoen van oorlogsgeweld, oproer of natuurrampen.

4.  Indien het document van tijdelijke invoer niet is gezuiverd kan de aansprakelijke organisatie niet worden verplicht meer te betalen dan het bedrag van de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer, welke verschuldigd zijn voor het voertuig of voor de losse onderdelen welke niet weder werden uitgevoerd, eventueel vermeerderd met de rente wegens achterstallige betaling.   

### Artikel  28  

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst doen geen afbreuk aan het recht van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen om in geval van fraude, overtreding of misbruik zowel tegen degene, te wiens name het document van tijdelijke invoer is gesteld als tegen de personen die van deze documenten gebruik maken, vervolging in te stellen tot invordering van de rechten en heffingen ter zake van de invoer, alsmede voor het opleggen van de straffen waaraan deze personen zich hebben blootgesteld.

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII
