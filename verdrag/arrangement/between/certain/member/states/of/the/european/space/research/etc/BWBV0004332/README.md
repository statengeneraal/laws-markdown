1. EXPERIMENTS TO BE FLOWN The TD-1 satellite is intended to enable the operation in space of a group of seven scientific experiments. Two of these experiments shall study the high energy X-ray spectrum of the sun and require one axis of the satellite to be permanently pointed at the sun. Four experiments shall scan the sky in several regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (UV and infrared), to study the emission from stars and other galactic or possible extragalactic sources, with different degrees of spectral and directional precision. These experiments shall take advantage of a slow continuous rotation of the satellite around the axis pointing at the sun. One experiment shall measure the composition of primary cosmic particles of cosmic and solar origin as well as the fluxes of protons coming from the sun and those trapped in the Van Allen belts. The list of the actual experiments to be flown is given below.  *Solar gamma and X-ray experiments:*  

S.88 : Solar gamma-ray detection in the energy range 50-300 MeV 

- Scintillator/photomultiplier arrangement

- X-ray collimator and proportional counters arrangement  

- Experiment sponsored by the Saclay Nuclear Research Institute.      *Cosmic ray charge distribution experiment:*  

S.67 A : Spectrometry of primary charged particles.  

- Solid state detectors and Cerenkov counter.  

- Experiment sponsored by the Saclay Nuclear Research Institute. The TD-1 satellite shall be designed in order to accommodate the seven above-mentioned experiments. If, in the development of the project, serious difficulties make it necessary to consider a change in the composition of the payload, this would be treated in accordance with the existing ESRO procedure for the modification of satellite payloads resulting from development difficulties.    

2. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE SPACECRAFT The satellite shall consist essentially of two boxes, one containing the experiments and the other, mounted beneath it, containing the functional spacecraft equipment. The experiment compartment shall be built around the two large telescopes S.I/2/68 and S.59 and the spark chamber S.I33. The equipment compartment shall house the equipment necessary for the functioning of the satellites, e.g. the attitude control subsystem, the command receiver and decoders, the housekeeping subsystem, the data storage and transmission subsystem, the power conditioning, storage and distribution units. The satellite shall be powered by solar cells, mounted on solar paddles, hinged from opposite edges of the same face of the satellite body. This face of the satellite shall be controlled to face the sun during the sun-lit phase of the orbit with an accuracy of the order of 1 minute of arc. Telecommand and telemetry transmissions shall take place in the V.H.F. band, through an antenna located at the tip of a deployable boom. The satellite dimensions shall be about 1 x 0,9 x 2 m. Its weight shall be approximately 460 kg. The satellite shall be launched into a quasi circular orbit at about 550 km altitude by a Thor Delta vehicle. The inclination of the orbit and time of launch shall be selected so that a sun-synchronous orbit is achieved. The satellite shall be designed to operate during the sun-lit phase of such an orbit only and for a maximum life time of 6 months. Three satellite units shall be produced: 

- a first prototype model P 1  

- a qualification model P 2  

- the flight model.    

3. USE OF KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION, AND EQUIPMENT RESULTING FROM THE WORK ALREADY DONE UNDER THE PRELIMINARY CONTRACT FOR THE TD 1/TD 2 SATELLITES All information and knowledge already accumulated under the preliminary contract for the TD 1/TD 2 satellites, at the contractor and in the Organisation, shall be made available to the TD project, wherever this is of use for the implementation of that project. Equipment already developed or under construction in the framework of the preliminary contract for the TD1/TD2 satellites shall be used, wherever possible, for the benefit of the TD project. The TD project shall be conducted in such a way that the fullest use shall be made of the knowledge accumulated and of the equipment developed under the preliminary contract for the TD1/TD2 satellites.  

4. TIME-SCALE TO COMPLETION The TD project shall be conducted so as to lead to the earliest possible launch date compatible with a high probability of success in orbit. The overall time-scale for the project shall take into account the necessity of ensuring a reasonable separation between the end of the tests on the first satellite prototype PI and the delivery of experiments and equipment for integration into the qualification satellite model P2. Recognizing that the mission requirements can only be met if launch takes place during short windows in Spring and Autumn each year, a launch in Spring 1972 shall be set as a target for the TD satellite. The Organization shall endeavour to assist the scientific groups involved in meeting the most economical time-scale leading to a launch in Spring 1972.  

5. METHODS AND MEANS OF CONTROL BY THE ORGANISATION The Organisation shall aim at ensuring the best possible control of the TD project, as regards technical performances, time-scale and costs. To achieve this goal, the Organisation shall set up a project group, containing an adequate number of suitably qualified specialists. This project group shall constitute an integral part of ESTEC. Its function shall be to monitor the works for which the prime contractor is responsible, to monitor the works which are undertaken within the Organisation and directly concerned with the execution of the project and to ensure the compatibility of interfaces throughout the project. The project group shall comprise only persons working exclusively for the TD project. The size of this group shall be approximately 50 persons. The TD project group shall receive as need be, the assistance of functional support divisions of the Organisation. Adequate modern control techniques shall be used in the conduct of the project. These methods shall enable the project managers in industry and in ESRO to know at regular intervals the overall situation of the project as regards technical progress, time-scale and cost and to compare it with reference plans forming part of the development contract. The corresponding control procedures shall be made parts of the contractual obligations imposed on the prime contractor and his co- and sub-contractors. The control methods to be applied shall provide the information to be presented in the reports mentioned in paragraph 4 of Annex B to the Arrangement for the execution of the special TD project.  

6. REVISION CLAUSE FOR THIS ANNEX Should for any reason the application of any provision of this Annex reveal impractibility, then the Governments and the Organisation shall enter into negotiations with a view to amending these provisions in order to achieve the earliest possible launch date, with a high chance of success, at minimum cost, without substantially affecting the scientific objectives of the mission as planned.

1. AAN BOORD TE NEMEN EXPERIMENTEN De satelliet TD-1 is bestemd voor het in de ruimte uitvoeren van een zevental wetenschappelijke experimenten. Twee van deze experimenten zullen dienen voor de bestudering van het spectrum van harde solaire roentgenstralen. Hiertoe is het noodzakelijk dat een der assen van de satelliet voortdurend op de zon gericht blijft. Vier experimenten moeten binnen verschillende gedeelten van het electro-magnetische spectrum (ultraviolet en infrarood) de hemel aftasten ter bestudering van de uitstraling van sterren en andere galactische en wellicht extra-galactische krachtbronnen in verschillende gradaties van spectrale duidelijkheid en nauwkeurigheid van richting. Bij deze experimenten dient gebruik te worden gemaakt van de langzame en voortdurende roterende beweging van de naar de zon gerichte as van de satelliet. Eén experiment ten slotte dient voor het meten van de samenstelling van primaire kosmische deeltjes, afkomstig vanuit het heelal en de zon, van de van de zon afkomstige protongolven en van de protonen, vastgehouden binnen de Van Allengordels. Een opsomming van de aan boord van de satelliet te nemen experimenten luidt als volgt:  *Experimenten met solaire gamma- en roentgenstralen:*  

S.88 : Het aantonen van solaire gammastralen in de energie-zone van 50-300 mega-electronvolt 

- Scintillator/fotomultiplicatorbuis  

- Experiment te leveren door het Natuurkundig Instituut van de Universiteit van Milaan.    

S.100 : Bestudering van solaire roentgenstralen in de energie-zone van 20-300 kilo-electronvolt 

- Scintillator/ fotomultiplicatorbuis  

- Experiment te leveren door het Laboratorium voor Ruimte-onderzoek van de Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht.      *Experimenten met de ultraviolette straling van sterren:*

- Experiment te leveren door het Natuurkundig Instituut van de Universiteit van Milaan tezamen met het Instituut voor natuurkunde der hemellichamen te München en het Nucleaire Studiecentrum te Saclay.    

S.77 : Spectrometrie van de vanuit de kosmische ruimte afkomstige roentgenstralen in de energie-zone van 3-30 kilo-electronvolt 

- Collimator voor roentgenstralen en proportionele tellers  

- Experiment te leveren door het Nucleaire Studiecentrum te Saclay.      *Experiment met de verdeling van kosmische stralingsladingen:*  

S.67 A : Spectrometrie van primair geladen deeltjes: 

- Semi-automatische verklikkers en Cerenkov-teller  

- Experiment te leveren door het Nucleaire Studiecentrum te Saclay.     De TD-1 satelliet dient zodanig te worden ontworpen, dat de uitvoering van de hierboven genoemde zeven experimenten mogelijk is. Indien tijdens de ontwikkeling van het project ernstige moeilijkheden het noodzakelijk maken de samenstelling van de nuttige lading te herzien, moet gehandeld worden volgens de normale procedure van de Organisatie betreffende wijzigingen van de nuttige lading, veroorzaakt door moeilijkheden gerezen tijdens de ontwikkeling van het project.  

2. KORTE BESCHRIJVING VAN HET RUIMTEVOERTUIG De satelliet bestaat in feite uit twee afdelingen, waarvan de eerste de experimenten bevat en het daaronder gemonteerde tweede compartiment de functionele uitrusting van de satelliet. De experimentenafdeling wordt opgebouwd rond de beide grote telescopen (S.l/2/68 en S.59) en de vonkenkamer (S.133). De uitrustingsafdeling bevat de uitrustingsstukken, nodig voor het functioneren van de satelliet, zoals bijvoorbeeld de secundaire hoogtemeter, het ontvangst- en decoderingstoestel voor afstandsbesturing, het secundaire systeem voor technische controle, het secundaire apparaat voor het opslaan en overbrengen van gegevens, de eenheden voor de transformatie, het opslaan en de distribuering van energie. De brandstof van de satelliet wordt geleverd door zonnecellen, gemonteerd op zonnepanelen, opgehangen aan de uiteinden van een der wanden van de satelliet. Deze wand wordt naar de zon gericht tijdens de omloopfase, waarin de satelliet door de zon wordt beschenen met een nauwkeurigheid van 1 boogminuut. Overbrenging van afstandsbesturing en afstandsmeting dienen plaats te vinden binnen de VHF-band door middel van een antenne, bevestigd aan het einde van een uitschuifbare arm. De afmetingen van de satelliet liggen in de orde van grootte van 1 x 0,9 x 2 meter. Zijn gewicht is *±* 460 kg. De satelliet moet door een Thor Delta-raket in een vrijwel cirkelvormige baan op ongeveer 550 kilometer hoogte worden gebracht. De helling van de baan en het tijdstip der lancering worden zodanig gekozen, dat de omloopbaan van de satelliet evenwijdig is aan de schijnbare omloopbaan van de zon. De satelliet wordt zodanig ontworpen, dat zij alleen in bedrijf komt tijdens de periode, waarin zij door de zon wordt beschenen en een maximale levensduur heeft van zes maanden. Er dienen drie satellieten te worden vervaardigd: 

- een eerste model (P1)  

- een model ter goedkeuring (P2)  

- het vliegmodel.    

3. GEBRUIK VAN KENNIS, GEGEVENS EN MATERIAAL, VERKREGEN UIT DE REEDS VERRICHTE WERKZAAMHEDEN IN HET KADER VAN HET VOORLOPIGE CONTRACT INZAKE DE SATELLIETEN TD-1 en TD Alle reeds in het kader van het voorlopige contract voor de satellieten TD-1 en TD-2 verzamelde kennis en gegevens, die zich hetzij bij de Organisatie, hetzij bij de contractant bevinden, worden, al naar mate zij van nut kunnen zijn voor de verwezenlijking van het onderhavige project, medegedeeld aan degenen, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het TD-project. De reeds op basis van het voorlopige contract ontwikkelde apparatuur voor de satellieten TD-1 en TD-2 dient zoveel mogelijk te worden benut voor de verwezenlijking van het TD-project. Het TD-project wordt zodanig uitgevoerd, dat ten volle gebruik wordt gemaakt van de in het kader van het voorlopige contract voor de TD-1 en TD-2 satellieten verkregen kennis en ontwikkelde apparatuur.  

4. TIJDSCHEMA VOOR DE VOLTOOIING De uitvoering van het TD-project geschiedt zodanig, dat de vroegst mogelijke lanceringsdatum wordt aangehouden die een goede kans biedt op een zo succesvol mogelijk functioneren van de satelliet in zijn omloopbaan. In het globale tijdschema dient rekening te worden gehouden met een redelijk tijdsverloop tussen de beëindiging van de proeven met het eerste model (P1) van de satelliet en de datum van aflevering van experimenten en uitrusting, die in het goedgekeurde model (P2) worden geplaatst. In aanmerking genomen dat de satelliet zijn opdracht slechts kan vervullen indien de lancering plaatsvindt gedurende korte tijdvensters in de lente en de herfst van ieder jaar, moet worden gestreefd naar een lancering van de TD-satelliet in het voorjaar van 1972. De Organisatie tracht de betrokken wetenschappelijke groepen bij te staan bij het volgen van een zo scherp mogelijk gesteld tijdschema, gericht op een lancering in het voorjaar van 1972.  

5. METHODEN EN MIDDELEN VAN CONTROLE DOOR DE ORGANISATIE De Organisatie stelt zich ten doel een zo goed mogelijke controle uit te oefenen op het TD-project, zowel wat betreft de technische werkzaamheden als het tijdschema en de kosten. Te dien einde wordt door de Organisatie een projectgroep opgericht, samengesteld uit een voldoende aantal deskundigen op de betrokken gebieden. Deze groep maakt een integrerend deel uit van de ESTEC. Haar taak bestaat uit het toezicht op de onder verantwoordelijkheid van de hoofduitvoerder vallende werkzaamheden, het toezicht op de in het kader van de Organisatie ondernomen en rechtstreeks met de uitvoering van het project verband houdende werkzaamheden en het zorgen voor een goede aansluiting van de raakvlakken tijdens alle stadia van het project. De groep bestaat uit een vijftigtal personen die uitsluitend werkzaam moeten zijn bij het TD-project. De projectgroep geniet, waar nodig, operationele steun van de desbetreffende afdelingen van de Organisatie. Bij de uitvoering van het project dienen moderne en doeltreffende controlemethoden te worden toegepast. Deze methoden moeten de voor het project verantwoordelijke personen, zowel in de betrokken industrieën als in de Organisatie, in staat stellen op geregelde tijden een inzicht te verkrijgen in de voortgang van het totale project, wat betreft de technische vorderingen, het tijdschema en de kosten, ter vergelijking met het programma, voorzien in het contract van uitvoering. De toepassing van deze controlemethoden moet deel uitmaken van de contractuele verplichtingen, opgelegd aan de hoofduitvoerder, zijn medecontractanten en de directies van de toeleveringsbedrijven. De toe te passen controlemethoden dienen de gegevens te verschaffen, die vermeld moeten worden in de rapporten, bedoeld in paragraaf 4 van Bijlage B van deze Overeenkomst.  

6. CLAUSULE TER HERZIENING VAN DEZE BIJLAGE Indien om wat voor reden ook de toepassing van een of meer in deze Bijlage vervatte bepalingen onmogelijk zou blijken te zijn, dienen de Regeringen en de Organisatie onderling overleg te plegen over zodanige wijzigingen van deze bepalingen, dat de datum van lancering van de satelliet zo vroeg mogelijk wordt gesteld met een zo groot mogelijke kans op succes, tegen de laagst mogelijke kosten en zonder wezenlijke aantasting van de wetenschappelijke doelen van de opdracht.
