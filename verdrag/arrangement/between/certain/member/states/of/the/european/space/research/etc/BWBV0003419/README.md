####Arrangement between certain Member States of the European Space Research Organisation and the European Space Research Organisation concerning the execution of the Spacelab programme

Preamble The Governments signatories of this Arrangement, (hereinafter referred to as “the Participants”) being Governments of States parties to the Convention for the establishment of a European Space Research Organisation opened for signature on 14 June 1962 (hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”), and the European Space Research Organisation (hereinafter referred to as “the Organisation”), Having regard to the United States Authorities’ offer to Europe to take part in the post-Apollo programme by developing one or more research and application modules and by making use of the shuttle and orbital system, Recalling Resolution No. 3 of 24 July 1970 of the European Space Conference on cooperation in the post-Apollo programme, and the agreement reached by the European Space Conference at its meeting in Brussels on 20 December 1972, concerning the execution of the Spacelab programme, which has been notified to the United States Authorities, and under which this programme shall be executed in the first instance by the Organisation and be pursued later on by the future European Space Agency, Considering the advantage to international cooperation from an active contribution from Europe towards the execution of the most important space programme currently developed and the advantage to Europe from developing its space technology through participation in this programme, Recalling the authority already granted by the Council of the Organisation at its 50th Session (ESRO/C/MIN/50), on the basis of which the Director General has initiated the project definition phase of the Spacelab programme, Considering the draft Memorandum of Understanding (ESRO/ C(73)2, rev. 1 - Annex III) between the Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States Government (hereinafter referred to as the “Memorandum of Unterstanding”), Having regard to the Resolution adopted by the Council of the Organisation at its 53rd Session, concerning the approval to execute the vSpacelab programme within the framework of the Organisation (ESRO/C/LIII/Res. 1 (Final)),   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

1.  The Participants shall, under the provisions of the present Arrangement and in particular of Article 5 thereof, undertake in close cooperation with the United States Authorities a programme having as its objective the definition, design, development and construction of the Spacelab as a technically integrated part of the United States' shuttle and orbital system and Europe's contribution to the post-Apollo programme with which it is to be used.   
2.  The objectives and elements of the Spacelab programme are described in Annex A to the present Arrangement.   

### Article  2  

The programme referred to in Article 1 above shall be broken down into two phases, a definition phase which has already been started and a design, development and construction phase. 

1. The purpose of the definition phase (sub-phases B1-B3) of the Spacelab programme is to establish the configuration of the Spacelab in the light of the requirements of the users and to define the corresponding sub-systems. The results available at the end of sub-phase B2 will serve as a basis for the preparation of a technical proposal and a development plan, together with a detailed cost analysis and an estimate of the cost of the design, development and construction phase.  

2. The elements for the detailed analysis referred to in paragraph 1 of the present Article shall be available to the Participants by 1 August 1973 and will also be notified to the other Member States of the Organisation.  

3. The decision to proceed to the design, development and construction phase shall be taken in conformity with the provisions of Article 5 below.    

### Article  3  

1.  The Organisation shall, under Article VIII of the Convention, execute the Spacelab programme in conformity with the timetable and other provisions set out in Annex A to this Arrangement.   
2.  Except where otherwise provided in this Arrangement, the Organisation shall execute the programme in conformity with the Rules and Procedures in force in the Organisation.   
3.  For the purpose of the cooperation with NASA referred to in Article 1 above, and in order to ensure close integration of the Spacelab with the other elements of the shuttle and orbital system, particularly with the development of the space shuttle, the Organisation shall set up, on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding, a structure for cooperation and coordination with NASA. The European scientific and technical users shall be associated with the work of the Organisation and NASA.   

### Article  4  

1.  A Programme Board, composed of representatives of the Participants, shall be responsible for the programme and shall take all decisions relating to it in conformity with the provisions of this Arrangement.   
2.  For matters affecting more than one programme of the Organisation, the Programme Board shall be advisory to the Council of the Organisation, to which it will on such matters make all necessary recommendations.   
3.  The Programme Board shall in particular: 

(a) provide the Director General of the Organisation with all necessary instructions concerning the execution of the programme, in particular regarding the interfaces of the programme with the other elements of the shuttle and orbital system of the United-States,  

(b) ensure that close links are established by the Organisation with the future European users of the Spacelab system,  

(c) ensure implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding and any other relevant legal documents as far as the rights and obligations of the Participants are concerned,  

(d) study, if possible at least three years before the end of the development of Spacelab, the rules for implementing the principles referred to in Article 10 of this Arrangement.     
4.  The Programme Board may establish such advisory bodies as it may deem necessary for the proper execution of the programme.   
5.  Except where otherwise provided in this Arrangement, the decisions of the Programme Board shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for the Organisation's Council which shall apply mutatis mutandis.   

### Article  5  

1.  The financial envelope of the programme on the date of opening the present Arrangement for signature is estimated at 308 millions of accounting units at mid-1973 prices, on the basis of the elements described in Annex B to the present Arrangement. This amount will be reviewed at the end of sub-phase B2 of the definition phase. The Participants agree that, should this review confirm the overall financial assumptions, they will continue the programme and initiate sub-phase B3 of the definition phase, as well as the design, development and construction phase. Should it appear that the estimates will be significantly exceeded, the Participants who so wish may withdraw from the programme; however, those Participants that wish to continue with the programme shall consult among themselves and determine arrangements for such continuation.   
2.  The Participants fix a financial envelope of 10 millions of accounting units for the definition phase studies due to be completed by the end of 1973. The Participants agree to contribute to the financing of these studies in accordance with the scale set out in Annex B of the present Arrangement, but only up to the amounts required for the execution of sub-phases B1 and B2 due to be completed by the end of July 1973. When the review referred to in paragraph 1 of the present Article is carried out, the Participants will decide whether to unblock the amount of the envelope that relates to sub-phase B3.   
3.  When fixing the overall financial envelope of this programme in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of the present Article, the Participants shall determine, by unanimous agreement, their individual percentage contributions.   
4.  The relevant annual budgets shall be subject to the approval of the Programme Board by a two-thirds majority within the relevant financial envelope.   

### Article  6  

1.  The Participants agree, in order that the overall financial envelope of the programme referred to in Article 5, paragraph 3 of the present Arrangement may be revised in the event of changes in price levels, to apply the procedure in force in the Organisation at that time.   
2.  If the overall financial envelope needs to be revised for reasons other than changes in price levels, the following provisions shall apply: 

(a) if the cumulative overruns of estimated costs to completion do not exceed 20% of the amount of the overall financial envelope of the programme, no Participant shall be entitled to withdraw from the programme and the Programme Board shall decide on the additional expenditure by a two-thirds majority;  

(b) if the cumulative overruns of estimated costs to completion exceed 20% of the amount of the overall financial envelope, the Participants who so wish may withdraw from the programme subject to the provisions of Article 17. Those Participants that wish to continue the programme shall consult among themselves and determine the arrangements for such continuation. They shall report accordingly to the Council of the Organisation which will take any necessary decision.     

### Article  7  

Intellectual property rights arising from the execution of the programme, as well as access to and use of technical information so arising, shall be reserved to the Participants insofar as this is consistent with the relevant terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, but the Organisation shall have the right to make use of them free of charge for its activities as a whole.  

### Article  8  

1.  The Participants authorise the Organisation to conclude the necessary contracts for the execution of the programme in conformity with the Organisation's rules and procedures. However, in placing contracts and sub-contracts for the execution of the programme, first preference shall be given, wherever possible, to having the work executed in the territories of the Participants and second preference to having it done in the territories of other Member States of the Organisation, taking into consideration the decisions of the Council of the Organisation in the matter of contractual policy and distribution of work.   
2.  For this purpose the geographical distribution of contracts among the Participants concerning the Spacelab programme shall correspond to the percentage contributions of the Participants. Since the percentage of work to be performed in non-Member States either by direct contracts from the Organisation or by sub-contracts issued by the industrial prime contractor, will probably in this programme be unusually high, the Organisation shall keep the amount of such contracts and sub-contracts under review and ensure that they are excluded from the preparation of statistics on the geographical distribution of contracts amongst Participants.   

### Article  9  

1.  The Organisation, acting on behalf of the Participants, shall be the owner of the Spacelab elements developed under the programme, as well as of the facilities and equipment acquired for its execution.   
2.  The terms and conditions for making available to NASA the elements developed under this Arrangement, as defined in Annex A, shall be fixed by the Memorandum of Understanding between the Organisation and NASA and, as appropriate, by the intergovernmental Agreement between the Participants and the Government of the United States, referred to in Article 10 below. Any transfer of facilities and equipment acquired shall be decided on by the Programme Board, in consultation with the Council of the Organisation.   

### Article  10  

The Participants intend to define, in consultation with the Council of the Organisation, in an Agreement with the Government of the United States, the principles relating to the use of the Spacelab and the other parts of the shuttle and orbital system, in particular the space shuttle, access to United States technology, and all other questions appropriate to such an Agreement.  

### Article  11  

1.  The Participants shall indemnify the Organisation in respect of any obligation it may incur should its international liability be involved as a result of the execution of the programme.   
2.  Any compensation for damage received by the Organisation with respect to the programme shall be credited to the annual programme budgets referred to in Article 5, paragraph 4.   

### Article  12  

The Participants have noted the provisions of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding with NASA and their rights and obligations arising therefrom, and they agree to the Council of the Organisation authorising the Director General to sign the text as approved by the Programme Board and the Council. Should this Memorandum not enter into force, or should it be modified substantially, the Participants will consult among themselves with a view to determine the appropriate measures to be taken.  

### Article  13  

1.  Any dispute which arises between two or more of the Participants, or between any of them and the Organisation, concerning the interpretation or application of this Arrangement, and which cannot be settled by mutual consent, shall be submitted at the request of any party to the dispute to a single arbitrator to be appointed by the President of the International Court of Justice. The arbitrator may not be a national of a State which is party to the dispute, nor be permanently resident in that State.   
2.  Those parties to the Arrangement which are not parties to the dispute shall have the right to join in the proceedings and the arbitrator's decision shall be binding on all the Participants and the Organisation, whether or not they have joined in the proceedings.   

### Article  14  

1.  This Arrangement shall be open for signature by the Member States of the Organisation from 1 March 1973 to 10 August 1973.

2.  The States shall become parties to this Arrangement: 

– either by signature not subject to ratification or approval,  

– or by depositing an instrument of ratification or approval with the Government of the French Republic if the Arrangement has been signed subject to ratification or approval.     
3.  This Arrangement shall come into force when it has been signed by the Organisation and when the aggregate contributions payable, on the basis of the scale set out in Annex B, by the States that have become parties to this Arrangement, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, amount to two-thirds of the total contributions payable, for the sub-phase B2.   
4.  For the purpose of paragraph 3 of this Article, the deposit, with the depositary Government, of a declaration of intent to apply the Arrangement provisionally and to seek ratification or approval as soon as possible shall be considered as the deposit of an instrument of ratification or approval.   
5.  The Government of any Member State of the Organisation which has not signed the Arrangement by 10 August 1973 may become party to it after that date, provided the other Governments parties to the Arrangement agree. In such case, the Government in question must deposit an instrument of accession with the Government of the French Republic; it may also apply the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article in order to become a party to this Arrangement.   
6.  Unless the Programme Board unanimously decides otherwise, a Government that becomes a party to this Arrangement under the terms of paragraph 5 of the present Article, shall pay a contribution equal to that which it would have paid if it had been a party to the Arrangement at the moment of its entry into force, which shall also cover a contribution to the expenses for the definition phase, and this contribution shall be credited to the other Participants pro rata to their contributions to the programme budget.   

### Article  15  

The Government of a State that is not a Member of the Organisation may present a request to the Council of the Organisation to accede to the programme; a Council decision to grant such a request shall require unanimity and must be taken in agreement with the Programme Board, which shall unanimously determine the detailed terms of accession.

### Annex  A  

####to the Arrangement between certain Member States of the European Space Research Organisation and the European Space Research Organisation concerning the execution of the Spacelab programme

### 1  

####Objectives of the Spacelab programme

The Spacelab programme includes the definition, design, development and construction of mannable pressurised laboratory modules and unpressurised instrument platforms (pallets) suitable for conducting research and application activities on shuttle sortie missions. The laboratory module and the pallet, either separately or together, will be transported to and from earth orbit in the shuttle payload bay and will be attached to and supported by the shuttle orbiter stage throughout the mission. The laboratory module will be characterised by a pressurised (shirt-sleeve) environment, a versatile capability for accommodating laboratory and observatory equipment at minimum cost to users, rapid access for users, and minimum interference with shuttle orbiter ground turnaround operations. The pallet, supporting telescopes, antennas and other instruments and equipment requiring direct space exposure, will normally be attached to the laboratory module with its experiments remotely operated from the laboratory module, but can also be attached directly to the shuttle orbiter and operated from the orbiter cabin. Additional descriptive material of the concept will be included in the Preliminary Project Plan drawn up jointly with NASA.

a) het verstrekken aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van alle vereiste instructies betreffende de uitvoering van het programma, in het bijzonder aangaande de raakpunten van het programma met de andere onderdelen van het ruimteveerboot-transportsysteem van de Verenigde Staten,  

b) er zorg voor dragen dat door de Organisatie nauwe banden worden aangeknoopt met de toekomstige Europese gebruikers van het Ruimtelaboratoriumsysteem,  

c) het verzekeren van de uitvoering van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming en van andere desbetreffende rechtsdocumenten voor zover het de rechten en de plichten van de Deelnemers betreft,  

d) het bestuderen, indien mogelijk ten minste drie jaar voor de voltooiing van de ontwikkeling van het Ruimtelaboratorium, van de regels voor de toepassing van de beginselen bedoeld in artikel 10 van deze Overeenkomst.     
4.  De Programmaraad kan de adviesorganen instellen die hij nodig acht voor de goede uitvoering van het programma.   
5.  Behalve waar in deze Overeenkomst anders is bepaald worden de besluiten van de Programmaraad genomen overeenkomstig het reglement van orde van de Raad van de Organisatie dat mutatis mutandis wordt toegepast.   

### Artikel  5  

1.  Het financiële plafond voor het programma op de datum waarop deze Overeenkomst voor ondertekening wordt opengesteld, wordt geraamd op 308 miljoen rekeneenheden tegen de medio 1973 geldende prijzen, op basis van de gegevens beschreven in Bijlage B bij deze Overeenkomst. Aan het einde van sub-fase B2 van de definitiefase zal dit bedrag nader worden bezien. De Deelnemers komen overeen dat, indien dit nader onderzoek de algemene financiële veronderstellingen bevestigt, zij het programma zullen voortzetten en een aanvang maken met sub-fase B3 van de definitiefase, alsmede met de ontwerp-, ontwikkelings- en constructiefase. Indien mocht blijken dat de ramingen aanmerkelijk zullen worden overschreden, kunnen de Deelnemers die zulks wensen zich uit het programma terugtrekken; de Deelnemers die het programma wensen voort te zetten plegen evenwel onderling overleg ter vaststelling van de regelingen voor een zodanige voortzetting.   
2.  De Deelnemers stellen een financieel plafond van 10 miljoen rekeneenheden vast voor de studies van de omschrijvingsfase die aan het einde van 1973 moeten zijn voltooid. De Deelnemers komen overeen aan de financiering van deze studies bij te dragen overeenkomstig de verdeelsleutel vervat in Bijlage B bij deze Overeenkomst, doch slechts tot de bedragen vereist voor de uitvoering van de subfasen B1 en B2 die einde juli 1973 voltooid moeten zijn. Wanneer het nader onderzoek bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel is verricht., zullen de Deelnemers besluiten het bedrag te deblokkeren dat bij de bepaling van het financieel plafond is vastgesteld voor subfase B3.   
3.  Bij de vaststelling van het totale financiële plafond voor dit programma overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel bepalen de Deelnemers met eenparigheid van stemmen hun individuele procentuele bijdragen.   
4.  De desbetreffende jaarlijkse begrotingen worden met een tweederde meerderheid van stemmen door de Programmaraad goedgekeurd binnen de desbetreffende grenzen van het financiële plafond.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  De Deelnemers komen overeen dat, ten einde het totale financiële plafond voor het programma bedoeld in het derde lid van artikel 5 van deze Overeenkomst, te kunnen herzien in geval van veranderingen in het prijspeil, de op dat tijdstip binnen de Organisatie geldende procedures zullen worden toegepast.   
2.  Indien het totale financiële plafond om andere redenen dan veranderingen in het prijspeil moet worden herzien zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

a) indien de cumulatieve overschrijdingen van de geraamde kosten voor de voltooiing niet meer belopen dan 20% van het bedrag van de totale raming voor het programma is een Deelnemer niet gerechtigd zich uit het programma terug te trekken en besluit de Programmaraad met een twee derde meerderheid van stemmen over de bijkomende uitgaven;  

b) indien de cumulatieve overschrijdingen van de geraamde kosten voor de voltooiing meer belopen dan 20% van de totale raming, kunnen de Deelnemers die zulks wensen zich terugtrekken uit het programma, onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in artikel 17. De Deelnemers die het programma wensen voort te zetten, plegen onderling overleg en stellen de regelingen voor een zodanige voortzetting vast. Zij brengen dienovereenkomstig verslag uit aan de Raad van de Organisatie die de vereiste besluiten neemt.     

### Artikel  7  

Intellectuele eigendomsrechten voortvloeiend uit de uitvoering van het programma, evenals toegang tot en gebruik van technische gegevens die aldus worden verkregen, zijn voorbehouden aan de Deelnemers voor zover dit verenigbaar is met de desbetreffende voorwaarden van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming, maar de Organisatie heeft het recht daar kosteloos gebruik van te maken voor al haar eigen werkzaamheden.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  De Deelnemers machtigen de Organisatie de nodige contracten te sluiten voor de uitvoering van het programma overeenkomstig de regels en procedures van de Organisatie. Bij het plaatsen van contracten en sub-contracten voor de uitvoering van het programma wordt evenwel waar mogelijk in eerste instantie de voorkeur gegeven aan het laten verrichten van de werkzaamheden op het grondgebied van de Deelnemers en daarna aan de uitvoering ervan op het grondgebied van andere Lid-Staten van de Organisatie, met inachtneming van de besluiten van de Raad van de Organisatie ter zake van het beleid omtrent het plaatsen van contracten en de werkverdeling.   
2.  Hiertoe dient de geografische verdeling van contracten tussen de Deelnemers betreffende het Ruimtelaboratorium-programma overeen te komen met de procentuele bijdragen van de Deelnemers. Aangezien het percentage van de werkzaamheden dat op grond van rechtstreekse contracten geplaatst door de Organisatie of van subcontracten geplaatst door de industriële hoofdcontractant in niet-Lid-Staten moet worden verricht in dit programma waarschijnlijk ongewoon hoog zal zijn, houdt de Organisatie het bedrag van zodanige contracten en sub-contracten bij en draagt zij er zorg voor dat deze niet in aanmerking worden genomen bij de opstelling van statistieken omtrent de geografische verdeling van contracten tussen de Deelnemers.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De Organisatie, optredend namens de Deelnemers, is eigenares van de in het kader van dit programma ontwikkelde Ruimtelaboratorium-bestanddelen, alsmede van de installatie en uitrusting die voor de uitvoering van het programma zijn verworven.   
2.  De voorwaarden en bedingen voor het aan de NASA ter beschikking stellen van de krachtens deze Overeenkomst ontwikkelde bestanddelen, zoals omschreven in Bijlage A, worden vastgesteld in het Memorandum van Overeenstemming tussen de Organisatie en de NASA en, waar dienstig, bij de intergouvernementele overeenkomst tussen de Deelnemers en de Regering van de Verenigde Staten bedoeld in artikel 10. Over elke overdracht van verworven installaties en uitrusting wordt beslist door de Programmaraad, in overleg met de Raad van de Organisatie.   

### Artikel  10  

De Deelnemers zijn voornemens, in overleg met de Raad van de Organisatie, in een Overeenkomst met de Regering van de Verenigde Staten de beginselen te omschrijven betreffende het gebruik van het Ruimtelaboratorium en van de andere delen van het ruimteveerboot-transportsysteem, inzonderheid van de ruimteveerboot, de toegang tot technologie van de Verenigde Staten en alle andere vraagstukken die in een zodanige Overeenkomst moeten worden geregeld.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  De Deelnemers stellen de Organisatie schadeloos voor elke verplichting die deze aangaat, indien haar internationale aansprakelijkheid in het geding komt ten gevolge van de uitvoering van het programma.   
2.  Elke door de Organisatie ten aanzien van het programma ontvangen schadeloosstelling wordt gecrediteerd op de jaarlijkse programmabegrotingen bedoeld in het vierde lid van artikel .5.   

### Artikel  12  

De Deelnemers hebben kennis genomen van de bepalingen van het voorgestelde Memorandum van Overeenstemming met de NASA en van daaruit voortvloeiende rechten en verplichtingen en stemmen ermede in dat de Raad van de Organisatie de Directeur-Generaal machtigt de tekst, zoals goedgekeurd door de Programmaraad en de Raad, te ondertekenen. Indien dit Memorandum niet van kracht zou worden of ingrijpend zou worden gewijzigd, plegen de Deelnemers onderling overleg omtrent de te nemen passende maatregelen.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  Elk geschil dat zich voordoet tussen twee of meer Deelnemers of tussen een van hen en de Organisatie betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Overeenkomst en dat niet in onderling overleg kan worden geregeld, wordt op verzoek van een der partijen bij het geschil voorgelegd aan een scheidsman die moet worden benoemd door de President van het Internationaal Gerechtshof. De scheidsman mag geen onderdaan zijn van een Staat die partij is bij het geschil en evenmin permanent in die Staat zijn gevestigd.   
2.  De partijen bij de Overeenkomst die geen partij zijn bij het geschil hebben het recht deel te nemen aan de procedure en de beslissing van de scheidsman is bindend voor alle Deelnemers en de Organisatie, ongeacht of zij aan de procedure hebben deelgenomen.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Deze Overeenkomst staat van 1 maart 1973 tot en met 10 augustus 1973 open voor ondertekening door Lid-Staten van de Organisatie. Indien op deze datum de Overeenkomst van kracht is geworden in overeenstemming met het derde lid van dit artikel, zal zij voor ondertekening open blijven tot 23 september 1973.   
2.  Staten worden partij bij deze Overeenkomst door: 

- ondertekening zonder voorbehoud van bekrachtiging of goedkeuring,  

- nederlegging van een akte van bekrachtiging of goedkeuring bij de Regering van de Franse Republiek, indien de Overeenkomst werd ondertekend onder voorbehoud van bekrachtiging of goedkeuring.     
3.  Deze Overeenkomst wordt van kracht wanneer zij is ondertekend door de Organisatie en wanneer het totaal van de bijdragen, op basis van de verdeelsleutel vervat in Bijlage B te betalen door de Staten die partij bij deze Overeenkomst zijn geworden overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, twee derde beloopt van de totale te betalen bijdragen voor sub-fase B2.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van het derde lid van dit artikel wordt de nederlegging bij de depot-Regering van een verklaring van intentie tot voorlopige toepassing van de Overeenkomst en tot het zo spoedig mogelijk verkrijgen van bekrachtiging of goedkeuring, beschouwd als de nederlegging van een akte van bekrachtiging of goedkeuring.   
5.  De Regering van een Lid-Staat van de Organisatie die de Overeenkomst op 10 augustus 1973 nog niet heeft ondertekend kan daarna partij worden, mits de andere Regeringen die partij bij de Overeenkomst zijn daarmede instemmen. In zulk een geval moet de betrokken Regering een akte van toetreding nederleggen bij de Regering van de Franse Republiek; zij kan ook het bepaalde in het vierde lid van dit artikel toepassen ten einde partij bij deze Overeenkomst te worden.   
6.  Tenzij de Programmaraad met eenparigheid van stemmen anders besluit, betaalt een Regering die krachtens het vijfde lid van dit artikel partij bij deze Overeenkomst wordt een bijdrage gelijk aan die welke zij zou hebben betaald indien zij partij bij de Overeenkomst zou zijn geweest op het tijdstip van de inwerkingtreding daarvan, welke bijdrage ook een aandeel omvat in de kosten van de definitiefase, en voor deze bijdrage worden de andere Deelnemers gecrediteerd naar verhouding van hun bijdragen aan de programmabegroting.   

### Artikel  15  

De Regering van een Staat die geen lid van de Organisatie is, kan bij de Raad van de Organisatie een verzoek indienen om toetreding tot het programma; voor een besluit van de Raad tot instemming met een zodanig verzoek is eenparigheid van stemmen vereist en het moet worden genomen in overleg met de Programmaraad die met eenparigheid van stemmen en tot in bijzonderheden de toetredingsvoorwaarden bepaalt.  

### Artikel  16

### Bijlage  A  

####bij de Overeenkomst tussen bepaalde Lid-Staten van de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek en de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek betreffende de uitvoering van het Ruimtelaboratorium-programma

### 1  

####Doeleinden van het Ruimtelaboratorium-programma

Het Ruimtelaboratorium-programma omvat de definitie, het ontwerp, de ontwikkeling en de constructie van bemanbare onder druk staande laboratoriummodules en van niet onder druk staande instrumentenplatforms, geschikt voor het verrichten van onderzoek- en applicatiewerkzaamheden tijdens missies van de ruimteveerboot. De laboratoriummodule en het platform zullen, afzonderlijk of te zamen, naar en van de baan van de aarde worden vervoerd in de vrachtruimte van de ruimteveerboot en zullen gedurende de missie zijn verbonden met de ruimteveerboot en gebruik maken van de faciliteiten van de veerboot. De laboratoriummodule wordt gekenmerkt door een onder druk staande atmosfeer (zodat het dragen van speciale kleding overbodig is), een veelzijdig vermogen voor het huisvesten van laboratorium- en waarnemingsinstrumenten tegen de laagste kosten voor de gebruikers, snelle toegang voor de gebruikers en minimale verstoring van de werkzaamheden aan de ruimteveerboot op de grond tussen de missies. Het platform, dat telescopen, antennes en andere instrumenten en uitrusting draagt die rechtstreeks aan de ruimte moeten worden blootgesteld, zal gewoonlijk met de laboratoriummodule zijn verbonden, waarbij de proefnemingen op afstand worden verricht vanuit de laboratoriummodule, maar kan ook rechtstreeks met de ruimteveerboot worden verbonden en vanuit de veerbootcabine worden bediend. Verdere beschrijvingen van deze opzet zullen worden opgenomen in het Voorlopige Projectplan dat te zamen met de NASA wordt opgesteld.
