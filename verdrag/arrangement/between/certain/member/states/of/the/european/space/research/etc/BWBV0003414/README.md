Its design life shall not be less than 3 years. The communication package shall permit communication between the satellite and ships using frequencies at L-band (15351542.5 MHz for satellite to ship liaisons and 1636.5 - 1644 MHz for ship to satellite liaisons). Links from the satellite to the shore will make use of the frequency allocations for satellite services [at 11 and 14 GHz or alternatively at 4 and 6 GHz]. The communications transponder will be capable of providing the following 4 types of channel: 

(a) communications channels for shore-to-ship (forward channels) voice and data messages;  

(b) communications channels for ship-to-shore (return channels) voice and data messages;  

(c) access channel for shore-to-ship (forward) access messages;  

(d) shore-to-shore communications channels to relay voice and data messages for network coordination purposes.   Some of the (a) and (b) channels shall be sufficiently linear to carry frequency multiplexed teleprinter and telex signals, ranging signals and distress signals. The coverage will include the whole segment of the earth visible from the satellite's position in the geostationary orbit.  

### 4  

####Ground Facilities included in the MAROTS Space Segment

The MAROTS space segment includes the following ground elements: 

(a)  *Satellite Control Facilities (SCF)*  One set of Satellite Control Facilities (SCF) consisting of a Satellite Control Centre (SCC) connected to a Satellite Control Earth Terminal (SCET) which will perform telemetry, tracking and all command services and link calibration functions.  

(b)  *Electronic Test Sets (ETS)*  A few Electronic Test Sets (ETS) which will support system performance evaluation and calibration and will be capable of transmitting and receiving all L-band signals to and from the satellites.

### Bijlage  A  

####bij de Overeenkomst tussen bepaalde Lid-Staten van de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek en de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek betreffende de uitvoering van een programma voor een maritieme satelliet

### 1  

####Doelstellingen van het Programma voor Proefnemingen met een maritieme satelliet in een haan om de aarde

Het „MAROTS”-Programma voorziet in een ruimtesegment voor de verkrijging van zowel experimentele gegevens als preoperationele ervaring op het gebied van de toepassingen van de ruimtevaart voor maritieme doeleinden.  

### 2  

####Beschrijving van het Programma

Het „MAROTS”-Programma voorziet in de plaatsing in een geostationaire baan boven de Atlantische Oceaan in 1977, alsook in de daarop volgende evaluatie in de baan, van een satelliet die voldoende communicatiecapaciteit en kwaliteit bezit om te zorgen voor een bevredigende preoperationele werking tussen scheeps- en walstations in overeenstemming met de volgende eisen: 

(a)  *Algemene Communicatie*  De satelliet dient de mogelijkheid te bieden tot: 

- evaluatie van verscheidene types stations aan boord van schepen;  

- evaluatie van verbindingen tussen het schip en de wal voor telefonie, telegrafie, overbrenging van gegevens en documenten met gebruikmaking van L-band frequenties tussen satelliet en schip, van verscheidene technieken voor modulatie en signaalverwerking en een serie van signaal-ruisverhoudingen;  

- het aantonen van de mogelijkheid tot aansluiting op openbare telefoon- en telegraaf netten;  

- het aantonen van de mogelijkheid tot de communicatie per satelliet door vele scheeps- en walstations gelijktijdig.    

(b)  *Noodtoestand, Opsporing en Redding en Veiligheid*  De satelliet dient de mogelijkheid te bieden tot: 

- evaluatie van technieken voor het bewerkstelligen van onmiddellijke toegang met prioriteit ten behoeve van communicatie in geval van nood;  

- evaluatie van speciale noodinstallaties met inbegrip van plaatsaanduidingsbakens;  

- demonstratie van „all ships”-informatie-uitzendingen en het geven van routevoorschriften afhankelijk van weersomstandigheden via de satelliet aan individuele vaartuigen.    

(c)  *Radioplaatsbepaling*  De satelliet dient de mogelijkheid te bieden tot evaluatie van peiltechnieken voor positiebepaling.    

### 3  

####Globale omschrijving van de Satelliet

De satelliet is gebaseerd op de Satelliet voor Proefnemingen in een baan om de aarde (OTS) die is ontwikkeld in het kader van het ESRO-Communicatiesatellietenprogramma, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van de modulaire aard van dit ruimtevoertuig om een maritieme communicatiemodule in te bouwen in het OTS-platform. Het MAROTS-ruimtevaartuig is daarom een 3-assig gestabiliseerd voertuig van modulair ontwerp, waarop naar de zon gerichte zonnepanelen bevestigd zijn en dat door een raket van de Delta-klasse kan worden gelanceerd. De te verwachten levensduur van de satelliet moet ten minste drie jaar zijn. De communicatie-apparatuur biedt de mogelijkheid tot communicatie tussen de satelliet en schepen gebruik makende van frequenties in de L-band (1535 - 1542,5 MHz voor verbindingen van satelliet naar schip en 1636,5 - 1644 MHz voor verbindingen van schip naar satelliet). Verbindingen van de satelliet niet de wal maken gebruik van de voor deze diensten toegewezen frequenties (11 en 14 GHz of 4 en 6 GHz). De communicatiezender-ontvanger is in staat de 4 volgende types kanalen beschikbaar te maken: 

(a) communicatiekanalen voor gesproken berichten en overseining van gegevens van de wal naar een schip (uitgaande kanalen);  

(b) communicatiekanalen voor gesproken berichten en overseining van gegevens van een schip naar de wal (inkomende kanalen);  

(c) toegangskanaal voor toegangsberichten van wal naar schip (uitgaand);  

(d) communicatiekanalen van wal tot wal om gesproken berichten en overgeseinde gegevens door te geven in verband met de coördinatie binnen het net.   Sommige van de kanalen zoals genoemd onder letter (a) en (b) dienen voldoende lineair te zijn om telexberichten, telex seinen, peilseinen en noodseinen met frequentie-multiplex techniek over te brengen. Het bereik hiervan omvat het gehele segment van de aarde dat zichtbaar is vanuit de positie van de satelliet in de geostationaire baan om de aarde.  

### 4  

####Voorzieningen op aarde die bij het MAROTS-ruimtesegment zijn inbegrepen

Het MAROTS-ruimtesegment omvat de volgende aardse elementen: 

(a)  *Satelliet controle faciliteiten (SCF)*  Een serie voorzieningen voor de controle over de satelliet bestaande uit een Satelliet Controle Centrum (SCC) verbonden met een grondstation voor de controle van satellieten (Satellite Control Earth Terminal (SCET)) dat voorziet in verremeting, baanbepaling en besturing van de satelliet en in de calibratie van de verbindingen.  

(b)  *Electronische Testapparatuur combinaties (Electronic Test Sets (ETS))*  Enkele Elektronische Testapparatuurcombinaties (ETS) die dienen ter ondersteuning van de evaluatie en calibratie van de werking van het systeem en die in staat zijn alle signalen op de L-band over te brengen naar en te ontvangen van de satellieten.    

### 5  

####Tijdschema

Het voorlopige tijdschema voor de ontwikkeling van het MAROTS-voertuig luidt als volgt: 

- fase A: oktober 1973 - december 1973;  

- fase B: januari 1974 - medio 1974;  

- fase C/D: medio 1974 - medio 1977.   De lancering van de satelliet is gepland voor medio 1977.
