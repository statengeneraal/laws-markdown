### Annex  A  

####to the Arrangement between certain Member States of the European Space Research Organisation and the European Space Research Organisation concerning the execution of a Communication Satellite Programme

### 1  

####Objectives of the European Communication Satellite Programme

The programme shall prepare for the setting up in Europe of an operational space communication system. This system is intended to provide satellite links for a substantial part of the predicted telecommunications traffic in the 1980s to satisfy the expected requirements of the users. The design of the satellite shall be such as to meet its objectives at the lowest possible cost, allowance for other objectives only being permitted where no extra cost would be involved.  

### 2  

####Description of the programme

The programme is divided into two Phases as follows: 

(a) A technological and experimental Phase, during which the communication techniques and the spacecraft technologies required for the programme will be developed on the ground and tested aboard experimental and pre-operational satellites (Phase 2).  

(b) A Phase devoted to the development of two operational flight units together, if necessary, with the launching, and evaluation in orbit, of a prototype model, and on its completion to making these operational flight units available to the potential users, one of them in orbit and the other on the ground, on terms to be agreed between the Participants and the users (Phase 3).   It was preceded by a preparatory programme definition Phase (Phase 1), which was completed in 1971. 

2.1.  *Phase 2 of the programme*  The developmental and technological Phase (Phase 2), is intended to run from 1972 to 1978, culminating essentially in the orbiting at the end of 1976 of an experimental and pre-operational spacecraft and its subsequent in-orbit evaluation. The work to be carried out in this Phase is divided under the following headings: 

(a) Communication system,  

(b) Supporting technology,  

(c) Experimental satellites,  

(d) Studies of operational configuration. 

2.1.1.  *Communication system*  The work in Phase 2 of the communication system will comprise: 

(a) overall system studies, covering inter alia, analysis of communication techniques such as PCM/PSK/TDMA (pulse code modulation/phase shift keying/time division multiple access), frequency re-use by polarisation diversification, space division multiple access, adaptive satellite radiated power, and on-board switching;  

(b) studies of transmission problems, such as impairment phenomena in the satellite repeater, interface problems at the earth stations;  

(c) propagation experiments, involving radiometric measurements for the provision of statistics on atmospheric attenuation, propagation measurements on terrestrial links for the study of depolarisation effects and measurements using satellites beacons to provide direct analysis of the anticipated phenomena;  

(d) earth segment studies, to be pursued in close collaboration with the users, to ensure that the overall satellite/earth segment system chosen is optimal.    

2.1.2.  *Supporting technology*  This area of Phase 2 covers the development and qualification of critical items in the following areas: 

- Communication technology;  

- Structures and mechanisms;  

- Thermal control;  

- Attitude and orbit control;  

- Energy conversion. These critical items are those which are necessary for the development of the experimental and pre-operational satellites (CTS and OTS) of Phase 2, as well as those which, because of their long period of development, are necessary for the final execution of Phase 3.    

2.1.3.  *Experimental and pre-operational satellites*  Phase 2 is to be completed by the in-orbit test of the components developed under the supporting technology phase, these in-orbit tests allowing: 

- the qualification in orbit of the 11/14 GHz communication equipment;  

- the qualification in orbit of the concept of a three-axis stabilised vehicle with orientable solar panels, and the equipment developed within the framework of the supporting technology programme and considered as critical;  

- the evaluation of communication techniques proposed for the operational system in collaboration with the users. Two satellites will be used for this experimental and pre-operational phase:  

- Under the Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Communications of Canada, ESRO-developed equipment will be incorporated in the Canadian Communications Technology Satellite, to be launched during 1975. The equipment to be flown is in the areas of communication technology (travelling wave tube amplifiers and parametric amplifiers) and of energy conversion (flexible solar array).  

- The second and more important part of the experimental and pre-operational programme will be the orbiting, at the end of 1976, of an experimental and pre-operational Orbital Test Satellite (OTS).   This satellite is to be launched by a vehicle of the Delta 2914 class. In summary, the OTS will be a three-axis stabilised, threeyear lifetime vehicle of modular conception, carrying sunorientated solar panels; the communications capability will include 40 and 120-MHz bandwidth 20-W repeaters, with spotbeam and Eurobeam antenna coverage.  

2.1.4  *Studies of operational configuration*  Within Phase 2 of the programme, studies of potential operational configurations will continue to be made, in liaison with the prospective users, to enable the optimum choice to be made in 1975-1976.  

2.1.5.  *Sub-Phase (2bis)*  Should the review of Phase 2 referred to in Article 2, paragraph 1 (a) of the Arrangement lead to the inclusion of a sub-Phase 2bis, this sub-Phase shall have as its aim to further advanced techniques and specialised studies in respect of possible operational satellite configurations.      

2.2.  *Phase 3 of the programme*  Shortly before the completion of Phase 2 of the programme, the subsequent Phase of the programme, involving the development and construction of two flight units of the operational vehicle, is commenced. The decision to commence Phase 3 is foreseen for 1975; taken in conjunction with the results of the experimentation in orbit, it is foreseen that 18 months of orbital data will be available at the time of the critical design reviews of the operational vehicle. Completion of Phase 3 is foreseen for 1980.    

### 3  

####Timetable

The tentative timetable is as follows: 

- Phase 1 - completed in 1971;  

- Phase 2 - technological development and subsequent in-orbit evaluation: 1972-1978. The development of the experimental and pre-operational vehicle is: 

Phase A: September 1972 - December 1972;  

Phase B: April 1973 - December 1973;  

Phase C: January 1974 - Early 1975;  

Phase D: Early 1975 - December 1976.   The launch of this vehicle is foreseen for end-December 1976.  

- Phase 3 - operational satellite development: 1975-1980 leading to operational configuration orbital operations outside Phase 3, from 1980 onwards.

### Bijlage  A  

####bij de Overeenkomst tussen bepaalde Lid-Staten van de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek en de Europese Organisatie voor Ruimteonderzoek betreffende de uitvoering van een telecommunicatiesatellieten-programma

### 1  

####Doeleinden van het Europese Communicatiesatellietenprogramma

Het programma richt zich op de stichting van een operationeel stelsel van ruimtecommunicatie in Europa. Dit stelsel is bedoeld satellietverbindingen te verschaffen ten behoeve van een belangrijk deel van het voorspelde telecommunicatieverkeer in de tachtiger jaren van deze eeuw, ten einde te voldoen aan de te verwachten behoeften van de gebruikers. De satelliet dient zodanig te zijn ontworpen, dat zij voldoet aan de gestelde doelen tegen de laagst mogelijke kosten, waarbij andere doelen slechts in aanmerking komen indien daarvoor geen extra kosten behoeven te worden gemaakt.  

### 2  

####Beschrijving van het programma

Het programma is verdeeld in twee Fasen en wel als volgt: 

a) Een technologische en experimentele Fase, gedurende welke de voor het programma benodigde communicatietechnieken en de technologie voor de ruimtevoertuigen op de grond worden ontwikkeld en aan boord van experimentele en pre-operationele satellieten worden beproefd (Fase 2);  

b) Een Fase, gewijd aan de ontwikkeling van twee operationele vluchteenheden tezamen, indien nodig, met het lanceren en het in de baan om de aarde evalueren van een prototype en, na voltooiing van deze ontwikkeling, aan het beschikbaar stellen van deze operationele vluchteenheden aan de potentiële gebruikers, namelijk een van hen in de baan om de aarde en de andere op de grond, op tussen de Deelnemers en de gebruikers overeen te komen voorwaarden (Fase 3).   Het programma werd voorafgegaan door een voorbereidende Fase van programmabeschrijving (Fase 1), die in 1971 werd voltooid. 

2.1  *Fase 2 van het programma*  Het ligt in de bedoeling dat de Fase, gewijd aan ontwikkeling en technologie (Fase 2) een tijdsduur in beslag zal nemen van 1972 tot 1978 en dat zij haar hoogtepunt zal vinden in het tegen einde 1976 in een baan om de aarde brengen van een experimenteel en pre-operationeel ruimtevoertuig en de daarop aansluitende evaluatie in de baan om de aarde. De in deze Fase uit te voeren werkzaamheden vallen uiteen in de volgende categorieën: 

a) communicatiesysteem,  

b) ondersteunende technologie,  

c) experimentele satellieten,  

d) studies betreffende operationele configuratie. 

2.1.1.  *Communicatiesysteem*  De werkzaamheden tijdens Fase 2 betreffende het communicatiesysteem omvatten: 

a) studies betreffende het gehele systeem, hetgeen onder meer inhoudt: analyse van bepaalde communicatietechnieken, zoals PCM/ PSK/TDMA (pulse code modulation (puls code modulatie), phase shift keying (fase-sprong modulatie), time division multiple access (meervoudige toegang door tijdverdeling)), frequency re-use by polarization diversification (meervoudig frequentiegebruik door polarisatie-diversificatie), space division multiple access (meervoudige toegang gebaseerd op ruimtelijke verdeling), adaptive satellite radiated power (aanpasbaar uitgezonden satellietvermogen) en on-board switching (het routeren van verbindingen door omschakeling in de satelliet),  

b) studies betreffende transmissieproblemen, zoals vervormingsverschijnselen in de satelliet-versterker, aanpassingsproblemen van de grondstations,  

c) voortplantingsproeven, waaronder radiometrische metingen voor het verkrijgen van statistische gegevens inzake demping door de atmosfeer, voortplantingsmetingen op aardse verbindingen voor de bestudering van de depolarisatie-effecten en metingen met gebruikmaking van satellietbakens ter verkrijging van een rechtstreekse analyse van de verwachte verschijnselen,  

d) studies van de grondstations-apparatuur, te verrichten in nauwe samenwerking met de gebruikers, ten einde te waarborgen dat het gekozen satelliet/grondsectorsysteem optimaal is.    

2.1.2.  *Ondersteunende technologie*  Dit onderdeel van Fase 2 omvat de ontwikkeling en de beproeving en goedkeuring van kritische onderdelen op de volgende gebieden: 

- Technologie der communicatie;  

- Mechanische constructies;  

- Thermische controle;  

- Controle op stand en omloopbaan;  

- Omzetting van energie.   Deze kritische onderdelen zijn die welke nodig zijn voor de ontwikkeling van de experimentele en pre-operationele satellieten (CTS en OTS) van Fase 2, alsmede - wegens hun lange ontwikkelingsduur - die welke nodig zijn voor de uiteindelijke uitvoering van Fase 3.    

2.1.3.  *Experimentele en pre-operationele satellieten*  Fase 2 dient te worden afgesloten met het beproeven van de tijdens de fase van de ondersteunende technologie ontwikkelde componenten in een baan om de aarde; deze proeven in een baan om.de aarde bieden de mogelijkheid tot: 

- de beproeving en goedkeuring in een baan om de aarde van de 11/14 GHz-communicatie-apparatuur;  

- de beproeving en goedkeuring in een baan om de aarde van het ontwerp van een drie-assig gestabiliseerd voertuig met richtbare zonnepanelen, alsook van apparatuur die is ontwikkeld in het kader van het programma voor ondersteunende technologie en als kritisch wordt beschouwd;  

- de evaluatie, in samenwerking met de gebruikers, van voor het operationeel systeem voorgestelde communicatietechnieken. Voor deze experimentele, pre-operationele fase zullen twee satellieten worden gebruikt:  

- Krachtens het Memorandum van Overeenstemming met het Ministerie van Verbindingen van Canada zal door de ESRO ontwikkelde apparatuur worden ingebouwd in de in 1975 te lanceren Canadese Technologische Communicatiesatelliet. De in te bouwen apparatuur heeft betrekking op de technologie der communicatie (lopende golfbuisversterkers en parametrische versterkers) en op omzetting van energie (flexibele bundels zonnecellen).  

- Het tweede, belangrijker deel van het experimentele en pre-operationele programma zal bestaan in het in een baan om de aarde brengen, eind 1976, van een experimentele en pre-operationele „Orbital Test Satellite” (OTS) (Satelliet voor proefnemingen in een baan om de aarde). Deze satelliet zal worden gelanceerd door middel van een drager van de Delta 2914klasse.   Samenvattend is de OTS een drie-assig, gestabiliseerd voertuig van het modulaire type met een levensduur van drie jaar, voorzien van naar de zon gerichte zonnepanelen; het communicatiepotentieel omvat 20 Watt-versterkers met bandbreedten van 40 en 120 MHz en met antennes voor het bestrijken van zeer kleine oppervlakten (spotbeam), alswel voor het bestrijken van geheel Europa (Eurobeam).  

2.1.4.  *Studies betreffende operationele configuraties*  Tijdens Fase 2 van het programma wordt de bestudering van potentiële operationele configuraties voortgezet in samenwerking met de toekomstige gebruikers, opdat in 1975-1976 een optimale keuze kan worden gemaakt.  

2.1.5.  *Sub-fase (2bis)*  Indien de herziening van de in artikel 2, eerste lid, letter *a,* van de Overeenkomst vermelde Fase 2 zou leiden tot opneming van een Sub-fase 2bis, zal deze Sub-fase zijn gericht op het bevorderen van geavanceerde technieken en gespecialiseerde studies met betrekking tot mogelijke configuraties van de operationele satelliet.    

2.2.  *Fase 3 van het programma*  Kort voor de voltooiing van Fase 2 van het programma wordt begonnen met de daarop volgende Fase van het programma, inhoudende de ontwikkeling en vervaardiging van twee vluchtexemplaren van het operationele voertuig.     De beslissing ten aanzien van de aanvang van Fase 3 wordt in 1975 verwacht; rekening houdend met de resultaten van de proefnemingen in een baan om de aarde wordt verwacht dat er op het ogenblik dat het ontwerp van het operationele voertuig aan een kritisch onderzoek wordt onderworpen gegevens betreffende de baan om de aarde beschikbaar zullen zijn over een periode van 18 maanden. Naar verwachting zal Fase 3 in 1980 worden afgesloten.  

### 3  

####Tijdschema

Het voorlopig tijdschema ziet er als volgt uit: 

- Fase 1 - afgesloten in 1971.  

- Fase 2 - technologische ontwikkeling en daarop volgende evaluatie in een baan om de aarde: 1972-1978. De ontwikkeling van het experimentele en pre-operationele voertuig wordt als volgt ingedeeld:
