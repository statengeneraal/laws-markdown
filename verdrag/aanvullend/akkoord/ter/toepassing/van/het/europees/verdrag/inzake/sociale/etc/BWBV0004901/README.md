Where, having regard to Article 10 of the Convention, the person concerned satisfies the conditions for admission to optional continued insurance in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) under more than one scheme, by virtue of the legislation of a Contracting Party, and has not been compulsorily insured under any of those schemes by virtue of his most recent employment, he shall qualify for admission to optional continued insurance only under the scheme which would have applied if he had followed, under the legislation of that Party, the employment subject to compulsory insurance for pension purposes which he last followed under the legislation of another Contracting Party. However, where the said employment was not subject to compulsory insurance under the legislation of the first Party, or where the nature of that employment cannot be determined, then the competent authority of that Party or such institution as it may designate shall decide the scheme under which the optional insurance may be continued.   
2.

### Article  8  

Where a person in receipt of benefit under the legislation of one Contracting Party is also entitled to benefits under the legislation of one or more of the other Contracting Parties, the following rules shall apply: 

(a) where the application of the provisions of Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Convention would entail the reduction, suspension or suppression of such benefits, none of them may be reduced, suspended or suppressed to an extent greater than the amount which would be obtained by dividing the sum affected by the reduction, suspension or suppression in accordance with the legislation under which benefit is due by the number of benefits subject to reduction, suspension or suppression to which the beneficiary is entitled;  

(b) nevertheless, where the benefits concerned are invalidity, old age, or death (pensions) benefits paid out in conformity with the provisions of Article 29 of the Convention by the institution of a Contracting Party, that institution shall take account of the benefits, income or remuneration entailing the reduction, suspension or suppression of the benefits due from it solely for the purposes of the reduction, suspension or suppression of the amount referred to in Article 29, paragraphs 4 or 5, but not for the calculation of the theoretical amount referred to in Article 29, paragraphs 2 and 3; however, account shall be taken of such benefits, income or remuneration only to the extent of that fraction of their amount corresponding to the ratio of the periods completed, as prescribed in Article 29, paragraph 4, of the Convention;  

(c) for the application of the provisions of Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Convention, the competent institutions concerned shall communicate all relevant information to one another on request;  

(d) for the application of the provisions of Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Convention, the official rate of exchange shall be the rate prevailing on the first day of the month in which the final payment is made or, if the pension is recalculated, at the rate then prevailing.    

### Article  9

1.  Where death occurs in the territory of a Contracting Party, only entitlement to a death grant acquired under the legislation of that Party shall be recognised, to the exclusion of any right acquired under the legislation of another Contracting Party.   
2.  When death occurs in the territory of a Contracting Party and entitlement to death grant has been acquired solely under the legislation of two or more other Contracting Parties, or where death occurs outside the territory of either of the Contracting Parties, and entitlement to death grant has been acquired under the legislation of any Contracting Party, only the entitlement acquired under the legislation of the Contracting Party to which the person in respect of whom the death grant is payable was last subject shall be recognised, to the exclusion of any entitlement acquired under the legislation of any other Contracting Party.   

### Article  11  

Where, over the same period, two or more persons are entitled to family allowances under the legislation of two or more Contracting Parties with respect to the same members of the family, the Contracting Party to whose legislation the family's main breadwinner is subject shall be deemed to be the only competent State. However, where family allowances are payable under the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory the children reside or are brought up, by virtue of a person's employment or occupational activity, that Party shall be deemed to be the only competent State.

####The adding together of periods of insurance and of residence

####Application of Articles 10, 19, 28, 49 and 51 of the Convention

In the cases referred to in Article 10, Article 19, Article 28, paragraphs 1 to 4, Article 49, and Article 51, paragraphs 1 to 3, of the Convention, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 28, paragraph 4, or Article 51, paragraph 3, of the Convention, as the case may be, periods of insurance and periods of residence shall be added together in accordance with the following rules: 

(a) to the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of one Contracting Party shall be added the periods of insurance completed under the legislation of any other Contracting Party and also any periods of residence completed after the age of sixteen under the non-contributory scheme of any other Contracting Party, to the extent necessary to make up the total period of insurance or residence required under the legislation of the first Contracting Party for the acquisition, maintenance or recovery of entitlement to benefit provided always these periods do not overlap. In the case of invalidity, old age, or death (pensions) benefits to be paid by the institutions of two or more Contracting Parties in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Convention, each of the institutions concerned shall separately add together all the periods of insurance or residence completed by the person concerned under the legislation of all the Contracting Parties to which he has been subject;  

(b) where a period of compulsory insurance completed in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party coincides with a period of voluntary or optional continued insurance completed under the legislation of another Contracting Party, the first only shall be taken into account, without prejudice to the provisions of the second sentence of Article 16, paragraph 2, of the Convention;  

(c) where an actual period of insurance completed under the legislation of one Contracting Party coincides with a period assimilated to an actual period of insurance under the legislation of another Contracting Party, the first only shall be taken into account;  

(d) any period assimilated to an actual period of insurance under the legislation of two or more Contracting Parties shall be taken into account only by the institution of that Contracting Party to whose legislation the person insured was last compulsorily subject prior to the said period; where the insured person has not been compulsorily subject to the legislation of one of those Parties prior to the said period, that period shall be taken into account by the institution of that Contracting Party to whose legislation he was first compulsorily subject after the period in question;  

(e) where the time at which certain periods of insurance were completed under the legislation of a Contracting Party cannot be accurately determined, such periods shall be presumed not to overlap with periods completed under the legislation of another Contracting Party and shall be taken into account as may be necessary;  

(f) where, according to the legislation of one Contracting Party, certain periods of insurance are taken into account only if they have been completed within a specified time, the institution which applies this legislation shall take into account only periods completed under the legislation of another Contracting Party as have been completed within the same specified time.     
2.  Periods of insurance completed under a scheme of a Contracting Party to which the Convention does not apply, but which are taken into account by a scheme of that Party to which the Convention does apply, shall be considered as insurance periods to be taken into account for the purpose of adding together.   
3.  Where the periods of insurance completed under the legislation of one Contracting Party are expressed in units other than those used in the legislation of another Contracting Party, the conversion necessary for the purpose of adding them together shall be governed by the following rules: 

(a) where the person concerned has been working a six-day week: 

(i) one day shall be equivalent to eight hours, and vice versa;  

(ii) six days shall be equivalent to one week, and vice versa;  

(iii) twenty-six days shall be equivalent to one month, and vice versa;  

(iv) three months, or thirteen weeks, or seventy-eight days shall be equivalent to one quarter and vice versa;  

(v) for the conversion of weeks into months, and vice versa, the weeks and months shall be converted into days;  

(vi) the application of the rules set out above shall not result in a total, for periods completed during one calendar year, of more than three hundred and twelve days, or fifty-two weeks, or twelve months, or four quarters;    

(b) where the person concerned has been working a five-day week: 

(i) one day shall be equivalent to nine hours, and vice versa;  

(ii) five days shall be equivalent to one week, and vice versa;  

(iii) twenty-two days shall be equivalent to one month, and vice versa;  

(iv) three months, or thirteen weeks, or sixty-six days, shall be equivalent to one quarter, and vice versa;  

(v) for the conversion of weeks into months, and vice versa, the weeks and months shall be converted into days;  

(vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not result in a total, for periods completed during one calendar year, of more than two hundred and sixty-four days, or fifty-two weeks, or twelve months, or four quarters.       
4.  Where, in accordance with paragraph 1, sub-paragraph *(b)*, of this Article, periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) completed under the legislation of a Contracting Party are not taken into account when adding periods together, the contributions relating to such periods shall be considered as conferring entitlement to increased benefits under the said legislation. Where such legislation provides to supplementary insurance, the said contributions shall be taken into account for the calculation of the benefits due under such supplementary insurance.

Wanneer de rechthebbende op een krachtens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij verschuldigde uitkering eveneens recht heeft op uitkeringen krachtens de wetgevingen van één of meer andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, zijn de volgende voorschriften van toepassing: 

a) ingeval de toepassing van artikel 13, tweede lid van het Verdrag tot gevolg zou hebben dat deze uitkeringen gelijktijdig worden verminderd, geschorst of ingetrokken, mag geen van deze uitkeringen worden verminderd, geschorst of ingetrokken voor een bedrag dat hoger is dan het bedrag dat wordt verkregen door het bedrag waarop de vermindering, schorsing of intrekking krachtens de wetgeving op grond waarvan deze uitkering verschuldigd is, betrekking heeft, te delen door het aantal de rechthebbende toekomende uitkeringen, welke verminderd, geschorst of ingetrokken moeten worden;  

b) indien het echter uitkeringen bij invaliditeit, ouderdom of overlijden (pensioenen) betreft, welke overeenkomstig artikel 29 van het Verdrag door het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij zijn vastgesteld, houdt dit orgaan rekening met die uitkeringen, inkomsten of beloningen welke vermindering, schorsing of intrekking van de door dit orgaan verschuldigde uitkering tot gevolg hebben; dit geldt niet voor de berekening van het in artikel 29, tweede en derde lid van het Verdrag bedoelde theoretische bedrag, doch uitsluitend voor de vermindering, schorsing of intrekking van het in genoemd artikel 29, vierde of vijfde lid bedoelde bedrag; van het bedrag van deze uitkeringen, inkomsten of beloningen wordt echter slechts een gedeelte in aanmerking genomen, dat overeenkomstig artikel 29, vierde lid van het Verdrag naar verhouding van de duur van de vervulde tijdvakken wordt vastgesteld;

### Artikel  9  

Indien een persoon of een lid van zijn gezin aanspraak kan maken op prestaties bij moederschap krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen, worden deze prestaties uitsluitend verleend krachtens de wettelijke regeling van die van deze Partijen op het grondgebied waarvan de bevalling heeft plaatsgehad, of indien de bevalling niet op het grondgebied van één van deze Partijen heeft plaatsgevonden, uitsluitend krachtens de wettelijke regeling waaraan deze persoon laatstelijk onderworpen is geweest.

e) ingeval de periode waarin bepaalde tijdvakken van verzekering krachtens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij vervuld zijn, niet nauwkeurig kan worden vastgesteld, wordt ervan uitgegaan dat deze tijdvakken niet overlapt worden door krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij vervulde tijdvakken en wordt hiermede rekening gehouden, voor zover de tijdvakken hiervoor in aanmerking kunnen worden genomen;  

f) ingeval volgens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij bepaalde tijdvakken van verzekering slechts in aanmerking worden genomen indien zij binnen een bepaalde termijn zijn vervuld, houdt het orgaan dat deze wetgeving toepast slechts rekening met krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij vervulde tijdvakken indien deze binnen dezelfde termijn zijn vervuld.     
2.  De tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens een stelsel van een Verdragsluitende Partij waarop het Verdrag niet van toepassing is, maar die in aanmerking worden genomen door een stelsel van dezelfde Partij waarop het Verdrag wel van toepassing is, worden beschouwd als tijdvakken van verzekering welke voor de samentelling in aanmerking dienen te worden genomen.   
3.  Wanneer de tijdvakken van verzekering, vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij, worden uitgedrukt in andere eenheden dan in de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij worden gebezigd, geschiedt de omrekening welke voor de samentelling nodig is volgens onderstaande regels: 

a) indien voor de belanghebbende de zesdaagse werkweek gold: 

i) geldt een dag als acht uren en omgekeerd;  

ii) gelden zes dagen als een week en omgekeerd;  

iii) gelden zesentwintig dagen als een maand en omgekeerd;  

iv) gelden drie maanden of dertien weken of achtenzeventig dagen als een kwartaal en omgekeerd;  

v) worden voor de omrekening van weken tot maanden en omgekeerd, de weken en maanden in dagen omgerekend;  

vi) mag toepassing van bovenstaande regels er niet toe leiden dat voor alle in de loop van een kalenderjaar vervulde tijdvakken een totaal van meer dan driehonderd en twaalf dagen of tweeënvijftig weken of twaalf maanden of vier kwartalen wordt verkregen;    

b) indien voor de belanghebbende de vijfdaagse werkweek gold: 

i) geldt een dag als negen uur en omgekeerd;  

ii) gelden vijf dagen als een week en omgekeerd;  

iii) gelden tweeëntwintig dagen als een maand en omgekeerd;  

iv) gelden drie maanden of dertien weken of zesenzestig dagen als een kwartaal en omgekeerd;  

v) worden voor de omrekening van weken tot maanden en omgekeerd, de weken en maanden in dagen omgerekend;  

vi) mag toepassing van bovenstaande regels er niet toe leiden dat voor alle in de loop van een kalenderjaar vervulde tijdvakken een totaal van meer dan tweehonderdvierenzestig dagen of tweeënvijftig weken of twaalf maanden of vier kwartalen wordt verkregen.       
4.  Wanneer krachtens het eerste lid, sub b) van dit artikel ingevolge de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij vervulde tijdvakken van verzekering op grond van een vrijwillige of vrijwillig voortgezette verzekering bij invaliditeit, ouderdom of overlijden (pensioenen) voor de samentelling niet in aanmerking worden genomen, worden de op deze tijdvakken betrekking hebbende premies of bijdragen geacht bestemd te zijn tot verhoging van de krachtens deze wetgeving verschuldigde uitkeringen. Indien deze wetgeving een aanvullende verzekering kent, worden bedoelde premies of bijdragen in aanmerking genomen voor de berekening van op grond van een dergelijke verzekering verschuldigde uitkeringen.

Om in aanmerking te komen voor verstrekkingen krachtens artikel 20 van het Verdrag, laat de belanghebbende zich en zijn gezinsleden inschrijven bij het orgaan van de woonplaats, onder overlegging van een bewijs waarin wordt verklaard dat hij voor zichzelf en zijn gezinsleden recht op deze verstrekkingen heeft. Dit bewijs wordt afgegeven door het bevoegde orgaan, in voorkomend geval na kennisneming van de door de werkgever verstrekte inlichtingen. Indien dit bewijs door de belanghebbende of zijn gezinsleden wordt overgelegd, verzoekt het orgaan van de woonplaats het bevoegde orgaan daarom.   
2.  Het in het vorige lid bedoelde bewijs blijft geldig zolang het orgaan van de woonplaats ter zake geen kennisgeving van intrekking heeft ontvangen.   
3.  Indien de belanghebbende de hoedanigheid van seizoenarbeider bezit, is het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde bewijs geldig gedurende de gehele voor de seizoenarbeid voorziene tijdsduur, tenzij het bevoegde orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats tussentijds van de intrekking in kennis stelt.   
4.  Het orgaan van de woonplaats stelt het bevoegde orgaan in kennis van iedere inschrijving welke het overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel heeft verricht.   
5.  Bij iedere aanvraag om verstrekkingen legt de aanvrager de bewijsstukken over welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, gewoonlijk voor de toekenning van verstrekkingen vereist worden.   
6.  Bij opneming in een ziekenhuis geeft het orgaan van de woonplaats, zodra het zulks heeft vernomen, aan het bevoegde orgaan kennis van de datum van opneming in de ziekeninrichting, van de vermoedelijke verblijfsduur en van de datum van ontslag.   
7.  De belanghebbende of zijn gezinsleden zijn verplicht het orgaan van de woonplaats in kennis te stellen van iedere verandering in hun omstandigheden waardoor het recht op verstrekkingen kan worden gewijzigd, in het bijzonder van iedere beëindiging of verandering van dienstbetrekking of beroepswerkzaamheden van de belanghebbende of iedere overbrenging van de woon- of verblijfplaats van de belanghebbende of van een gezinslid. Het bevoegde orgaan stelt het orgaan van de woonplaats eveneens in kennis van het beëindigen van de aansluiting van de belanghebbende of van diens rechten op verstrekkingen. Het orgaan van de woonplaats kan het bevoegde orgaan te allen tijde verzoeken alle inlichtingen te verschaffen omtrent de aansluiting van de belanghebbende of diens rechten op verstrekkingen.   

### Artikel  18  

Indien het grensarbeiders of hun gezinsleden betreft, mogen genees- en verbandmiddelen, brillen, kunstmiddelen van kleine omvang, laboratoriumanalyses en -proeven slechts worden afgegeven of verricht op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij werden voorgeschreven, overeenkomstig de wettelijke regeling van deze Partij.  

### Artikel  19  

1.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor uitkeringen krachtens artikel 20, eerste lid, sub b) van het Verdrag, wendt de belanghebbende zich binnen drie dagen na het begin van de arbeidsongeschiktheid tot het orgaan van de woonplaats onder overlegging van een kennisgeving van arbeidsonderbreking of, indien de wettelijke regeling welke door het bevoegde orgaan of het orgaan van de woonplaats wordt toegepast, hierin voorziet, een door de behandelende geneesheer afgegeven bewijs van arbeidsongeschiktheid. Bovendien is hij verplicht alle andere krachtens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat vereiste documenten over te leggen, naar gelang van de aard van de aangevraagde uitkeringen.   
2.  Wanneer de behandelende geneesheren van het land van de woonplaats geen bewijzen van arbeidsongeschiktheid afgeven, wendt de belanghebbende zich rechtstreeks tot het orgaan van de woonplaats, binnen de termijn welke is vastgesteld in de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling. Dit orgaan laat onmiddellijk de arbeidsongeschiktheid medisch vaststellen en het in het vorige lid bedoelde bewijs uitschrijven.   
3.  Het orgaan van de woonplaats zendt de in de vorige leden van dit artikel bedoelde documenten onverwijld door aan het bevoegde orgaan, onder vermelding van de vermoedelijke duur van de arbeidsongeschiktheid.   
4.  Zo spoedig mogelijk oefent het orgaan van de woonplaats de geneeskundige en administratieve controle op de belanghebbende uit en deelt het resultaat daarvan onverwijld mede aan het bevoegde orgaan, dat de bevoegdheid houdt de belanghebbende voor eigen rekening te doen onderzoeken door een arts van eigen keuze. Indien laatstbedoeld orgaan besluit de uitkeringen te weigeren, omdat de belanghebbende de controlevoorschriften niet heeft nageleefd, stelt dit orgaan hem in kennis van deze beslissing en zendt het gelijktijdig een afschrift daarvan aan het orgaan van de woonplaats.   
5.  Onverwijld wordt de belanghebbende van het einde van de arbeidsongeschiktheid in kennis gesteld door het orgaan van de woonplaats, dat daaromtrent het bevoegde orgaan onmiddellijk inlicht. Wanneer laatstbedoeld orgaan zelf beslist dat de belanghebbende weer arbeidsgeschikt is geworden, stelt het hem in kennis van deze beslissing en zendt het gelijktijdig een afschrift daarvan aan het orgaan van de woonplaats.   
6.  Indien, in hetzelfde geval, voor het einde van de arbeidsongeschiktheid twee verschillende data zijn vastgesteld onderscheidenlijk door het orgaan van de woonplaats en door het bevoegde orgaan, wordt de door het bevoegde orgaan vastgestelde datum aangehouden.   
7.  Wanneer de belanghebbende het werk hervat, geeft hij hiervan bericht aan het bevoegde orgaan, indien de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling hierin voorziet.   
8.  Het bevoegde orgaan betaalt de uitkeringen met behulp van alle daartoe aangewezen middelen, bij voorbeeld per internationale postwissel, en geeft het orgaan van de woonplaats hiervan kennis. Indien de uitkeringen door het orgaan van de woonplaats voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend, stelt het bevoegde orgaan de belanghebbende van zijn rechten in kennis op de wijze als voorzien bij de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling en geeft gelijktijdig het orgaan aan dat deze uitkeringen zal uitbetalen. Tegelijkertijd doet het bevoegde orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats mededeling van het bedrag van de uitkeringen, de data waarop zij moeten worden betaald en de maximumduur waarover zij ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat worden toegekend. Het bedrag van de door laatstbedoeld orgaan te betalen uitkeringen wordt omgerekend tegen de officiële wisselkoers welke geldig is op de eerste dag van de maand waarin deze uitkeringen worden betaald.

In plaats van het bewijs of de verklaring, bedoeld in het eerste, onderscheidenlijk het tweede lid van dit artikel, kan de loontrekkende aan het orgaan van de verblijfplaats het in artikel 21, eerste lid van het Akkoord bedoelde bewijs overleggen. In dit geval zijn de voorgaande leden van dit artikel niet van toepassing.

Het bewijs kan op verzoek van de belanghebbende na diens vertrek worden afgegeven, wanneer het wegens overmacht niet voordien kon worden opgemaakt.   
2.  Artikel 17, zesde lid van het Akkoord is van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
3.  In het in artikel 21, eerste lid, sub c)i) van het Verdrag bedoelde geval zijn de voorgaande leden van dit artikel van overeenkomstige toepassing.

ii) hetzij in de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij waaraan de aanvrager of de overledene laatstelijk onderworpen is geweest, in het geval bedoeld in artikel 32, tweede lid;    

b) de juistheid van de door de aanvrager verstrekte gegevens moet worden aangetoond door bij het aanvraagformulier gevoegde officiële stukken, of worden bevestigd door de bevoegde instanties van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont;  

c) voor zover mogelijk moet de aanvrager vermelden, ofwel het orgaan of de organen van de invaliditeits- of ouderdomsverzekering of van de verzekering bij overlijden (pensioenen) van elke Verdragsluitende Partij aan de wettelijke regeling waarvan hijzelf of de overledene is onderworpen geweest, ofwel de werkgever of werkgevers bij wie hijzelf of de overledene op het grondgebied van elke Verdragsluitende Partij is werkzaam geweest, zulks onder overlegging van de bewijzen van verrichte arbeid waarover hij mocht beschikken.    

### Artikel  34  

Om in aanmerking te komen voor toepassing van artikel 30, derde lid van het Verdrag, legt de aanvrager een bewijs over betreffende zijn gezinsleden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen dan die waar het orgaan dat de uitkeringen moet vaststellen gevestigd is. Dit bewijs wordt afgegeven door het orgaan van de ziekteverzekering van de woonplaats van deze gezinsleden of door een ander orgaan dat is aangewezen door de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan deze gezinsleden wonen. Artikel 25, tweede en derde lid van het Akkoord is van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

### Artikel  35  

Het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij houdt voor het bepalen van de mate van invaliditeit rekening met alle inlichtingen van medische en administratieve aard welke door het orgaan van enige andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn ingewonnen. Elk orgaan behoudt echter de bevoegdheid de aanvrager voor eigen rekening door een arts van eigen keuze te laten onderzoeken.  

### Artikel  36  

1.  De aanvragen om uitkering worden behandeld door het betrokken orgaan waaraan zij, overeenkomstig artikel 32 van het Akkoord, naargelang de omstandigheden, zijn gericht of doorgezonden. Dit orgaan wordt „het behandelende orgaan” genoemd.   
2.  Het behandelende orgaan geeft alle betrokken organen onmiddellijk kennis van de aanvragen om uitkeringen, opdat deze aanvragen gelijktijdig en onverwijld door deze organen kunnen worden behandeld.   

### Artikel  37  

1.  Voor de behandeling van de aanvragen om uitkeringen maakt het behandelende orgaan gebruik van een formulier waarin met name een opsomming en een samenvatting voorkomen van de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke door de belanghebbende zelf of de overledene krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van alle betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn vervuld.   
2.  De toezending van dit formulier aan het orgaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij geldt als toezending van bewijsstukken.   

### Artikel  38  

1.  Het behandelende orgaan vermeldt op het in artikel 37, eerste lid van het Akkoord bedoelde formulier de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld en zendt een exemplaar van dit formulier aan het orgaan van de invaliditeits- of ouderdomsverzekering of van de verzekering bij overlijden (pensioenen) van iedere Verdragsluitende Partij aan de wettelijke regeling waarvan de belanghebbende of de overledene is onderworpen geweest, in voorkomend geval onder bijvoeging van de bewijzen van verrichte arbeid welke de aanvrager heeft overgelegd.   
2.  Indien er slechts één ander orgaan bij betrokken is, vult dit orgaan het hem overeenkomstig het vorige lid toegezonden formulier aan met de vermelding van de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld. Vervolgens stelt dit orgaan, rekening houdende met artikel 28 van het Verdrag, vast welke rechten op grond van deze wettelijke regeling bestaan en vermeldt op dit formulier het theoretische bedrag en het werkelijke bedrag van de uitkering, berekend overeenkomstig artikel 29, tweede, derde, vierde of vijfde lid van het Verdrag, alsmede eventueel het bedrag van de uitkering waarop de aanvrager aanspraak zou kunnen maken uitsluitend op grond van de krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken, zonder dat de artikelen 28 tot en met 33 van het Verdrag worden toegepast. Nadat op genoemd formulier nog de rechtsmiddelen en de beroepstermijnen zijn vermeld, wordt het aan het behandelende orgaan teruggezonden.   
3.  Indien er twee of meer andere organen bij betrokken zijn, vult elk van deze organen het hem overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel toegezonden formulier aan met de vermelding van de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling zijn vervuld en zendt het aan het behandelende orgaan terug. Dit orgaan zendt het aldus aangevulde formulier aan alle betrokken organen; elk van deze organen stelt, rekening houdende met artikel 28 van het Verdrag, vast welke rechten op grond van de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling bestaan en vermeldt op dit formulier het theoretische bedrag en het werkelijke bedrag van de uitkering, berekend overeenkomstig artikel 29, tweede, derde, vierde of vijfde lid van het Verdrag, alsmede eventueel het bedrag van de uitkering waarop de aanvrager aanspraak zou kunnen maken uitsluitend op grond van de krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken, zonder dat de artikelen 28 tot en met 33 van het Verdrag worden toegepast. Nadat op genoemd formulier nog de rechtsmiddelen en de beroepstermijnen zijn vermeld, wordt het aan het behandelende orgaan teruggezonden.   
4.  Wanneer het behandelende orgaan in het bezit is van alle in het tweede of het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gegevens, stelt dit orgaan, rekening houdende met artikel 28 van het Verdrag, op zijn beurt vast welke rechten op grond van de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling bestaan en berekent, overeenkomstig artikel 29, tweede, derde, vierde of vijfde lid van het Verdrag, het theoretische bedrag en het werkelijke bedrag van de uitkering dat dit orgaan verschuldigd is, alsmede eventueel het bedrag van de uitkering waarop de aanvrager aanspraak zou kunnen maken uitsluitend op grond van de krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling vervulde tijdvakken, zonder dat de artikelen 28 tot en met 33 van het Verdrag worden toegepast.   
5.  Zodra het behandelende orgaan bij ontvangst van de in het tweede of derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gegevens vaststelt dat artikel 31, tweede of derde lid, artikel 32, tweede, vierde of vijfde lid of artikel 34, eerste lid van het Verdrag moet worden toegepast, stelt het de overige betrokken organen hiervan in kennis.   

### Artikel  39  

1.  Indien het behandelende orgaan vaststelt dat de aanvrager krachtens de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling recht heeft op uitkeringen zonder dat een beroep behoeft te worden gedaan op de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke zijn vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen waaraan de belanghebbende of de overledene onderworpen is geweest, betaalt dit orgaan hem deze onmiddellijk als voorlopige uitkering.   
2.  Elk orgaan dat overeenkomstig artikel 29, vijfde lid van het Verdrag gerechtigd is de uitkeringen of bestanddelen van uitkeringen welke het de rechthebbende verschuldigd is, rechtstreeks te berekenen, betaalt hem deze uitkeringen onmiddellijk. Indien een ander orgaan dan het behandelende orgaan deze uitkeringen rechtstreeks aan de rechthebbende betaalt, stelt het het behandelende orgaan hiervan onmiddellijk in kennis en reserveert het, met het oog op de toepassing van het zevende lid van dit artikel, het bedrag van de eventuele achterstallige termijnen ten behoeve van elk orgaan dat teveel mocht hebben uitbetaald.   
3.  Ingeval het behandelende orgaan uitkeringen betaalt krachtens het eerste lid van dit artikel, vermindert het deze uitkeringen in voorkomend geval met het bedrag van de uitkeringen welke krachtens het vorige lid door ieder ander orgaan werden betaald, zodra het hiervan op de hoogte is.   
4.  Indien een van de betrokken organen, het behandelende orgaan uitgezonderd, tijdens de behandeling van de aanvraag vaststelt dat de aanvrager recht heeft op uitkeringen krachtens de door eerstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling, zonder dat een beroep behoeft te worden gedaan op de tijdvakken van verzekering of van wonen welke zijn vervuld krachtens de wettelijke regelingen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen waaraan de belanghebbende of de overledene onderworpen is geweest, doet dit orgaan hiervan onverwijld mededeling aan het behandelende orgaan, dat het bedrag van deze uitkeringen onmiddellijk voor rekening van eerstbedoeld orgaan als voorlopige uitkering aan de rechthebbende uitbetaalt, in voorkomend geval onverminderd het bepaalde in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel.   
5.  Ingeval het behandelende orgaan uitkeringen zou moeten betalen krachtens het eerste en het vierde lid van dit artikel, betaalt het alleen de hoogste uitkering, in voorkomend geval onverminderd het bepaalde in het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel.   
6.  Ingeval het behandelende orgaan geen uitkeringen krachtens het eerste, tweede of vierde lid van dit artikel betaalt en in gevallen waarin vertraging kan optreden, betaalt dit orgaan de belanghebbende een terugvorderbaar voorschot, waarvan de hoogte wordt vastgesteld overeenkomstig artikel 29, eerste tot en met vierde lid van het Verdrag.   
7.  Bij de definitieve afdoening van de aanvraag om uitkeringen vereffenen het behandelende orgaan en de andere betrokken organen hun rekeningen betreffende de voorlopige uitkeringen en voorschotten, verleend overeenkomstig het eerste, derde, vierde, vijfde en zesde lid van dit artikel. De door deze organen ter zake teveel betaalde bedragen kunnen worden ingehouden op de termijnbetalingen welke zij aan de belanghebbende moeten verlenen.   

### Artikel  40  

1.  In het in artikel 34, tweede lid van het Verdrag bedoelde geval berekent het behandelende orgaan het definitieve bedrag van de aanvulling dat elk van de betrokken organen moet toekennen en geeft hen daarvan bericht.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van artikel 34 van het Verdrag vindt de omrekening van de in verschillende nationale muntsoorten luidende bedragen plaats tegen de officiële wisselkoers welke geldig is op de eerste dag van de maand waarin de laatste vaststellingshandeling plaatsvond.   

### Artikel  41  

Voor de toepassing van artikel 33, tweede en derde lid van het Verdrag zijn de artikelen 38 en 40 van het Akkoord van overeenkomstige toepassing.  

### Artikel  42  

1.  Elk der betrokken organen geeft de aanvrager kennis van de genomen beslissing op zijn aanvraag om uitkeringen, zodra deze beslissing, na overleg met het behandelende orgaan, als definitief kan worden beschouwd en licht hierover tegelijkertijd laatstbedoeld orgaan in. Elke beslissing moet er melding van maken dat het gaat om een gedeeltelijke vaststelling van de uitkering en bovendien aangeven de in de betrokken wettelijke regeling voorziene rechtsmiddelen en beroepstermijnen.   
2.  Na de definitieve afdoening van de aanvraag om uitkeringen zendt het behandelende orgaan de aanvrager alle door de betrokken organen genomen beslissingen toe, vergezeld van een samenvatting.   

### Artikel  43  

Ter bespoediging van de vaststelling van de uitkeringen zijn de volgende voorschriften van toepassing: 

a) wanneer een persoon die voordien aan de wettelijke regeling van één of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen onderworpen was, onderworpen is aan de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, verzoekt het bevoegde orgaan van laatstbedoelde Partij aan het verbindingsorgaan van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij of Partijen om alle gegevens, betreffende de organen waarbij de belanghebbende is aangesloten geweest en, eventueel, de inschrijvingsnummers welke hem zijn toegekend;  

b) op verzoek van de belanghebbende of van het orgaan, waarbij hij is aangesloten beginnen de betrokken organen op zijn vroegst één jaar voor de datum waarop de belanghebbende de pensioengerechtigde leeftijd bereikt, aan het opstellen, voor zover mogelijk, van een overzicht van zijn loopbaan.    

####Administratieve en medische controle

### Artikel  44  

1.  Wanneer een rechthebbende op: 

a) invaliditeitsuitkeringen;  

b) ouderdomsuitkeringen toegekend in geval van arbeidsongeschiktheid;  

c) ouderdomsuitkeringen toegekend aan bejaarde werklozen;  

d) ouderdomsuitkeringen toegekend in geval van beëindiging van de beroepswerkzaamheden;  

e) uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen toegekend in geval van invaliditeit of van arbeidsongeschiktheid;  

f) uitkeringen welke worden toegekend op voorwaarde dat de inkomsten van de rechthebbende een bepaalde grens niet overschrijden;   op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat woont of verblijft, wordt de administratieve en medische controle op verzoek van het bevoegde orgaan uitgeoefend door het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats, op de wijze als bepaald in de door laatstbedoeld orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling. Het bevoegde orgaan blijft evenwel bevoegd de rechthebbende voor eigen rekening te doen onderzoeken door een arts van eigen keuze.   
2.  Indien uit de in het vorige lid bedoelde controle blijkt dat de rechthebbende werkzaamheden verricht of dat hij inkomsten geniet welke de voorgeschreven grens overschrijden, is het orgaan van de woon- of verblijfplaats verplicht het bevoegde orgaan dat om controle heeft verzocht, een rapport toe te zenden. Dit rapport maakt melding van de door het bevoegde orgaan gevraagde inlichtingen en vermeldt in het bijzonder de aard van de verrichte werkzaamheden, het bedrag van de verdiensten of inkomsten, welke de belanghebbende gedurende het laatstelijk verstreken kwartaal genoot, de normale beloning welke tijdens een door het bevoegde orgaan te bepalen referentieperiode in hetzelfde gebied werd genoten door een werknemer van de beroepsgroep waartoe de belanghebbende behoorde in het beroep dat hij uitoefende voor hij invalide werd, alsmede in voorkomend geval het advies van een medisch deskundige omtrent de gezondheidstoestand van de belanghebbende.   

### Artikel  45  

Wanneer de belanghebbende na schorsing van de uitkeringen welke hij genoot, opnieuw recht op uitkeringen verkrijgt, terwijl hij op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat woont, verstrekken de betrokken organen elkaar alle nodige inlichtingen met het oog op de hervatting van bedoelde uitkeringen.  

####Betaling van de uitkeringen

### Artikel  46  

1.  Indien het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij dat uitkeringen verschuldigd is, de verschuldigde uitkeringen niet rechtstreeks betaalt aan de rechthebbenden die op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij wonen, wordt de betaling van deze uitkeringen op verzoek van het orgaan dat deze verschuldigd is, verricht door het verbindingsorgaan van laatstbedoelde Partij of door het orgaan van de woonplaats, zulks op de in de artikelen 47 tot en met 51 van het Akkoord bepaalde wijze; indien het orgaan dat uitkeringen verschuldigd is, deze rechtstreeks aan die rechthebbenden betaalt, geeft het van de betaling van de uitkeringen kennis aan het orgaan van de woonplaats.   
2.  De bepalingen van vroegere overeenkomsten, welke betrekking hebben op de betaling van uitkeringen en welke van toepassing zijn op de dag vóór de inwerkingtreding van het Akkoord, blijven van toepassing voor zover zij in bijlage 5 zijn vermeld.   

### Artikel  47  

Het orgaan dat uitkeringen verschuldigd is, zendt aan het verbindingsorgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de rechthebbende woont of aan het orgaan van de woonplaats, welke hierna „uitbetalend orgaan” worden genoemd, een borderel in tweevoud van de verschuldigde bedragen, dat uiterlijk twintig dagen voor de vervaldatum van de uitkeringen in het bezit van dit orgaan moet zijn.  

### Artikel  48  

1.  Tien dagen vóór de vervaldatum van de uitkeringen, stort het orgaan dat de uitkeringen verschuldigd is, in de valuta van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan het gevestigd is, het bedrag dat nodig is voor de betaling der verschuldigde bedragen welke vermeld staan op het in artikel 47 van het Akkoord bedoelde borderel. Deze storting geschiedt bij de nationale bank of bij een andere bank van deze Partij, op een rekening ten name van de nationale bank of een andere bank van de Verdragsluitende Partij, op het grondgebied waarvan het uitbetalende orgaan is gevestigd, aan order van dit orgaan. Deze storting geldt als kwijting van het verschuldigde bedrag. Het orgaan dat de uitkeringen verschuldigd is, zendt tegelijkertijd een bericht van storting aan het uitbetalende orgaan.   
2.  De bank op welker rekening de storting heeft plaatsgehad, crediteert het uitbetalende orgaan voor de tegenwaarde van het gestorte bedrag in de valuta van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan bedoeld orgaan is gevestigd.   
3.  Naam en plaats van vestiging van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde banken zijn in bijlage 6 vermeld.   

### Artikel  49  

1.  De verschuldigde bedragen welke op het in artikel 47 van het Akkoord bedoelde borderel zijn vermeld, worden door het uitbetalende orgaan voor rekening van het orgaan dat uitkeringen verschuldigd is, aan de rechthebbende betaald. Deze betalingen geschieden op de wijze als bepaald in de door het uitbetalende orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling.   
2.  Het aan de rechthebbende toekomende bedrag wordt omgerekend in de valuta van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, tegen de koers waartegen het uitbetalende orgaan voor het overeenkomstig artikel 48 van het Akkoord gestorte bedrag werd gecrediteerd.   
3.  Zodra het uitbetalend orgaan of enig ander door dit orgaan aangewezen orgaan kennis krijgt van een omstandigheid welke schorsing of intrekking van de uitkeringen rechtvaardigt, staakt het de betalingen. Dit geldt ook wanneer de rechthebbende zijn woonplaats overbrengt naar het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan die waarop het uitbetalende orgaan is gevestigd.   
4.  Het uitbetalende orgaan stelt het orgaan dat uitkeringen verschuldigd is, in kennis van elke beweegreden voor het staken van de betaling en doet dit orgaan in voorkomend geval mededeling van de datum waarop een gebeurtenis welke zulks rechtvaardigt, heeft plaatsgevonden.   

### Artikel  50  

1.  Aan het einde van elk betalingstijdvak worden de in artikel 49, eerste lid van het Akkoord bedoelde betalingen afgesloten, ten einde vast te stellen welke bedragen in feite aan de rechthebbenden of aan hun wettelijke vertegenwoordigers of gemachtigden zijn uitbetaald, alsmede welke bedragen niet zijn uitbetaald.   
2.  Het totale bedrag in cijfers en letters geschreven, uitgedrukt in de valuta van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan het orgaan dat de uitkeringen verschuldigd is, is gevestigd, wordt gewaarmerkt als zijnde in overeenstemming met de door het uitbetalende orgaan verrichte betalingen en wordt voorzien van de handtekening van de vertegenwoordiger van dit orgaan.   
3.  Het uitbetalende orgaan staat borg voor de regelmatigheid van de vastgestelde betalingen.   
4.  Het verschil tussen de door het orgaan dat de uitkeringen verschuldigd is gestorte bedragen, uitgedrukt in de valuta van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan dit orgaan is gevestigd en de in dezelfde valuta uitgedrukte waarde van de door het uitbetalende orgaan verantwoorde betalingen, wordt verrekend met op dezelfde grond later door het orgaan dat de uitkeringen verschuldigd is, te storten bedragen.   

### Artikel  51  

De kosten verbonden aan de uitbetaling van de uitkeringen, zoals porto- en bankkosten, kunnen door het uitbetalende orgaan aan de rechthebbenden in rekening worden gebracht, op de wijze, vastgesteld in de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling.  

### Artikel  52  

Wanneer de rechthebbende op uitkeringen welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen verschuldigd zijn, zijn woonplaats overbrengt van het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij naar dat van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, is hij verplicht hiervan kennis te geven aan het orgaan of de organen welke deze uitkeringen verschuldigd zijn en, in voorkomend geval, aan het uitbetalende orgaan.  

### Hoofdstuk  3  

####: Arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten

Algemene bepalingen  

####Toepassing van artikel 38 van het Verdrag

### Artikel  53  

1.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor verstrekkingen krachtens artikel 38, eerste lid, sub a) van het Verdrag, legt de werknemer aan het orgaan van de woonplaats een bewijs over waarin wordt verklaard dat hij recht op deze verstrekkingen heeft. Dit bewijs wordt afgegeven door het bevoegde orgaan, in voorkomend geval na kennisneming van de door de werkgever verstrekte inlichtingen. Indien de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat daarin voorziet, legt de werknemer bovendien aan het orgaan van de woonplaats een bericht van ontvangst van de aangifte van een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte over. Indien hij deze stukken niet overlegt, verzoekt het orgaan van de woonplaats het bevoegde orgaan daarom en verleent hem in afwachting daarvan verstrekkingen wegens ziekte, voorzover hij recht heeft op dergelijke verstrekkingen.   
2.  Het in het vorige lid bedoelde bewijs blijft geldig zolang het orgaan van de woonplaats ter zake geen kennisgeving van intrekking heeft ontvangen.   
3.  Indien de werknemer de hoedanigheid van seizoenarbeider bezit, is het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde bewijs geldig gedurende de gehele voor de seizoenarbeid voorziene tijdsduur, tenzij het bevoegde orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats tussentijds van de intrekking in kennis stelt.   
4.  Bij iedere aanvraag om verstrekkingen legt de werknemer de bewijsstukken over welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij woont, gewoonlijk voor de toekenning van verstrekkingen vereist worden.   
5.  Bij opneming in een ziekenhuis geeft het orgaan van de woonplaats, zodra het zulks heeft vernomen, aan het bevoegde orgaan kennis van de datum van opneming in de ziekeninrichting, van de vermoedelijke verblijfsduur en van de datum van ontslag.   
6.  De werknemer is verplicht het orgaan van de woonplaats in kennis te stellen van iedere verandering in zijn omstandigheden waardoor het recht op verstrekkingen kan worden gewijzigd, in het bijzonder van iedere beëindiging of verandering van dienstbetrekking of beroepswerkzaamheden of iedere overbrenging van de woon- of verblijfplaats. Het bevoegde orgaan stelt het orgaan van de woonplaats eveneens in kennis van het beëindigen van de rechten op verstrekkingen van de werknemer. Het orgaan van de woonplaats kan het bevoegde orgaan te allen tijde verzoeken alle inlichtingen te verschaffen omtrent de rechten op verstrekkingen van de werknemer.   
7.  Indien het grensarbeiders betreft, mogen genees- en verbandmiddelen, brillen, kunstmiddelen van kleine omvang, laboratoriumanalyses en -proeven slechts worden afgegeven of verricht op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar zij werden voorgeschreven en overeenkomstig de wettelijke regeling van deze Partij.   

### Artikel  54  

1.  Om krachtens artikel 38, eerste lid, sub b) van het Verdrag in aanmerking te komen voor andere uitkeringen dan renten, wendt de werknemer zich binnen drie dagen na het begin van de arbeidsongeschiktheid tot het orgaan van de woonplaats onder overlegging van een kennisgeving van arbeidsonderbreking of indien de wettelijke regeling welke door het bevoegde orgaan of het orgaan van de woonplaats wordt toegepast, hierin voorziet, een door de behandelende geneesheer afgegeven bewijs van arbeidsongeschiktheid. Bovendien is hij verplicht alle andere krachtens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat vereiste documenten over te leggen, naar gelang van de aard van de aangevraagde uitkeringen.   
2.  Wanneer de behandelende geneesheren van het land van de woonplaats geen bewijzen van arbeidsongeschiktheid afgeven, wendt de werknemer zich rechtstreeks tot het orgaan van de woonplaats, binnen de termijn welke is vastgesteld in de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling. Dit orgaan laat onmiddellijk de arbeidsongeschiktheid medisch vaststellen en het in het vorige lid bedoelde bewijs uitschrijven.   
3.  Het orgaan van de woonplaats zendt de in de vorige leden van dit artikel bedoelde documenten onverwijld door aan het bevoegde orgaan, onder vermelding van de vermoedelijke duur van de arbeidsongeschiktheid.   
4.  Zo spoedig mogelijk oefent het orgaan van de woonplaats de geneeskundige en administratieve controle op de werknemer uit, alsof het een eigen verzekerde betrof, en deelt het resultaat daarvan onverwijld mede aan het bevoegde orgaan, dat de bevoegdheid houdt de belanghebbende voor eigen rekening te doen onderzoeken door een arts van eigen keuze. Indien laatstbedoeld orgaan besluit de uitkeringen te weigeren omdat de werknemer de controlevoorschriften niet heeft nageleefd, stelt dit orgaan hem in kennis van deze beslissing en zendt het gelijktijdig een afschrift daarvan aan het orgaan van de woonplaats.   
5.  Onverwijld wordt de werknemer van het einde van de arbeidsongeschiktheid in kennis gesteld door het orgaan van de woonplaats, dat daaromtrent het bevoegde orgaan onmiddellijk inlicht. Wanneer laatstbedoeld orgaan zelf beslist dat de werknemer weer arbeidsgeschikt is geworden, stelt het hem in kennis van deze beslissing en zendt het gelijktijdig een afschrift daarvan aan het orgaan van de woonplaats.   
6.  Indien, in hetzelfde geval, voor het einde van de arbeidsongeschiktheid twee verschillende data zijn vastgesteld onderscheidenlijk door het orgaan van de woonplaats en door het bevoegde orgaan, wordt de door het bevoegde orgaan vastgestelde datum aangehouden.   
7.  Wanneer de werknemer het werk hervat, geeft hij hiervan bericht aan het bevoegde orgaan, indien de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling hierin voorziet.   
8.  Het bevoegde orgaan betaalt de uitkeringen met behulp van alle daartoe aangewezen middelen, bij voorbeeld per internationale postwissel, en geeft het orgaan van de woonplaats hiervan kennis. Indien de uitkeringen door het orgaan van de woonplaats voor rekening van het bevoegde orgaan worden verleend, stelt het bevoegde orgaan de werknemer van zijn rechten in kennis op de wijze als voorzien bij de door dit orgaan toegepaste wettelijke regeling en stelt hem gelijktijdig op de hoogte van het orgaan dat deze uitkeringen zal uitbetalen. Tegelijkertijd doet het bevoegde orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats mededeling van het bedrag van de uitkeringen, de data waarop zij moeten worden betaald en de maximumduur waarover zij ingevolge de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat worden toegekend. Het bedrag van de door laatstbedoeld orgaan te betalen uitkeringen wordt omgerekend tegen de officiële wisselkoers welke geldig is op de eerste dag van de maand waarin deze uitkeringen worden betaald.   

####Toepassing van artikel 40 van het Verdrag

### Artikel  55  

1.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor verstrekkingen, legt de in artikel 15, eerste lid, sub a) i) of tweede lid, sub a) van het Verdrag bedoelde loontrekkende aan het orgaan van de verblijfplaats het in artikel 12, eerste lid van het Akkoord bedoelde bewijs over. Wanneer bedoelde loontrekkende dit bewijs heeft overgelegd, wordt hij geacht te voldoen aan de voorwaarden voor het ingaan van het recht op verstrekkingen.   
2.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor verstrekkingen, legt de in artikel 15, eerste lid, sub b)i) van het Verdrag bedoelde loontrekkende, die zich voor de uitoefening van zijn beroep op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij dan de bevoegde Staat bevindt, aan het orgaan van de verblijfplaats zo spoedig mogelijk een verklaring over welke door de werkgever of diens vertegenwoordiger in de loop van de twee voorafgaande kalendermaanden is afgegeven. In deze verklaring wordt met name de datum vermeld sedert welke de belanghebbende voor rekening van bedoelde werkgever werkt, alsmede de naam en de plaats van vestiging van het bevoegde orgaan. Wanneer de loontrekkende deze verklaring heeft overgelegd, wordt hij geacht te voldoen aan de voorwaarden voor het ingaan van het recht op verstrekkingen. Indien hij niet in staat is zich vóór de medische behandeling tot het orgaan van de verblijfplaats te wenden, ontvangt hij deze behandeling desniettegenstaande op vertoon van bedoelde verklaring, alsof hij bij dat orgaan verzekerd was.   
3.  Het orgaan van de verblijfplaats richt zich onverwijld tot het bevoegde orgaan, teneinde te vernemen of de in het eerste, onderscheidenlijk het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde loontrekkende aan de voorwaarden voor het ingaan van het recht op verstrekkingen voldoet. Het is verplicht verstrekkingen te verlenen totdat antwoord van het bevoegde orgaan is ontvangen en ten hoogste gedurende dertig dagen.   
4.  Het bevoegde orgaan zendt het orgaan van de verblijfplaats antwoord binnen tien dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek van dit orgaan.

Deze aangifte wordt aan het bevoegde orgaan gericht en aan het orgaan van de woonplaats wordt, zo nodig, een afschrift gezonden.   
2.  Het orgaan van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan zich het arbeidsongeval of de beroepsziekte heeft voorgedaan, zendt het bevoegde orgaan de op dit grondgebied opgestelde geneeskundige verklaringen in tweevoud toe en verstrekt op verzoek van laatstbedoeld orgaan alle ter zake dienende inlichtingen.

1.  Wanneer het betrokken orgaan betwist dat in het in artikel 38, eerste lid of artikel 40, eerste lid van het Verdrag bedoelde geval, de wettelijke regeling inzake arbeidsongevallen of beroepsziekten van toepassing is, stelt het het orgaan van de woonplaats of het orgaan van de verblijfplaats dat de verstrekkingen heeft verleend, hiervan onmiddellijk in kennis; de verstrekkingen worden dan als verstrekkingen van de ziekteverzekering beschouwd en worden verder uit dien hoofde verleend, voorzover de belanghebbende recht heeft op dergelijke verstrekkingen.   
2.  Wanneer naar aanleiding van dit geschil een definitieve beslissing is genomen, stelt het betrokken orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats of het orgaan van de verblijfplaats dat de verstrekkingen heeft verleend, hiervan onmiddellijk in kennis. Indien het geen arbeidsongeval of beroepsziekte betreft, gaat dit orgaan voort met het verlenen van de verstrekkingen wegens ziekte, voorzover de belanghebbende recht heeft op deze verstrekkingen. In het tegenovergestelde geval, indien het wel een arbeidsongeval of beroepsziekte betreft, worden de door de werknemer genoten verstrekkingen van de ziekteverzekering beschouwd als verstrekkingen wegens arbeidsongeval of beroepsziekte.

a) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat het recht op uitkeringen niet afhankelijk is van voorwaarden inzake het vervullen van een dienstbetrekking of het verrichten van beroepswerkzaamheden, vermeldt het bewijs uitsluitend dat op de belanghebbende de wettelijke regeling van deze Staat van toepassing is;  

b) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat het recht op uitkeringen afhankelijk is van het gedurende een bepaalde tijd vervullen van een dienstbetrekking of verrichten van beroepswerkzaamheden, vermeldt het bewijs dat aan deze voorwaarde is voldaan;  

c) indien volgens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat de duur waarover recht op uitkeringen bestaat overeenkomt met de duur van de tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking of beroepswerkzaamheden, vermeldt het bewijs de duur van de gedurende het betreffende tijdvak vervulde dienstbetrekking of verrichte beroepswerkzaamheden.   Dit bewijs wordt op verzoek van de belanghebbende door het bevoegde orgaan verstrekt zodra hij aan de gestelde voorwaarden voldoet. Indien de gezinsleden genoemd bewijs niet overleggen, verzoekt het orgaan van hun woonplaats daarom aan het bevoegde orgaan.   
2.  Het in het vorige lid bedoelde bewijs blijft, in de sub a) en b) bedoelde gevallen, geldig zolang het orgaan van de woonplaats ter zake geen kennisgeving van intrekking heeft ontvangen. In het sub c) genoemde geval is dit bewijs echter slechts geldig gedurende drie maanden na de datum van afgifte en moet het door het bevoegde orgaan om de drie maanden ambtshalve worden vernieuwd.   
3.  Indien de belanghebbende de hoedanigheid van seizoenarbeider bezit, is het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde bewijs geldig gedurende de gehele voor de seizoenarbeid voorziene tijdsduur, tenzij het bevoegde orgaan het orgaan van de woonplaats tussentijds van de intrekking in kennis stelt.   
4.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de gezinsleden wonen bepaalt dat maandelijks of driemaandelijks uitkeringen worden toegekend, terwijl de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat bepaalt dat de duur waarover recht op uitkeringen bestaat overeenkomt met de tijdsduur waarover een dienstbetrekking werd vervuld of beroepswerkzaamheden werden verricht, worden de uitkeringen toegekend naar de verhouding van deze tijdsduur ten opzichte van de bij de wettelijke regeling van het land van de woonplaats van de gezinsleden bepaalde duur.   
5.  Indien de wettelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de gezinsleden wonen bepaalt dat de uitkeringen worden toegekend voor een aantal dagen dat overeenkomt met de dagen waarover een dienstbetrekking werd vervuld of beroepswerkzaamheden werden verricht, terwijl de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat bepaalt dat recht op uitkeringen bestaat voor een gehele maand of een geheel kwartaal, worden de uitkeringen voor een maand of een kwartaal toegekend.   
6.  Wanneer de tijdvakken van dienstbetrekking of beroepswerkzaamheden welke krachtens de wettelijke regeling van de bevoegde Staat zijn vervuld, in andere eenheden worden uitgedrukt dan die welke dienen voor de berekening van de uitkeringen krachtens de wetttelijke regeling van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de gezinsleden wonen, vindt in de in het vierde en vijfde lid van dit artikel bedoelde gevallen de omrekening plaats overeenkomstig artikel 15, derde lid van het Akkoord.   
7.  Het bevoegde orgaan stelt het orgaan van de woonplaats van de gezinsleden onmiddellijk in kennis van de datum met ingang waarvan de belanghebbende niet langer recht op uitkeringen heeft of zijn woonplaats van het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij naar dat van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij overbrengt. Het orgaan van de woonplaats van de gezinsleden kan te allen tijde aan het bevoegde orgaan verzoeken alle inlichtingen te verstrekken omtrent de rechten van de belanghebbende op uitkeringen.   
8.  De gezinsleden zijn verplicht bet orgaan van hun woonplaats in kennis te stellen van elke verandering in hun omstandigheden waardoor het recht op uitkeringen kan worden gewijzigd, in het bijzonder van elke overbrenging van hun woonplaats.   

### Artikel  82  

Indien gezinsleden in de loop van een kalendermaand of kalenderkwartaal hun woonplaats van het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij naar dat van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij overbrengen, komen de gezinsuitkeringen welke hun krachtens de wettelijke regeling van elk van deze Partijen worden toegekend overeen met het aantal dagelijkse uitkeringen welke krachtens de betreffende wettelijke regeling verschuldigd zijn. Indien volgens een van beide wettelijke regelingen de uitkeringen maandelijks of per kwartaal worden toegekend, worden deze uitkeringen toegekend naar evenredigheid van de tijdsduur waarover de belanghebbenden gedurende de betreffende maand of het betreffende kwartaal op het grondgebied van de betrokken Partij hebben gewoond.  

####Toepassing van artikel 62 van het Verdrag

### Artikel  83  

1.  Om in aanmerking te komen voor gezinsuitkeringen op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarop zij wonen, leggen de in artikel 62 van het Verdrag bedoelde gezinsleden aan het orgaan van hun woonplaats een bewijs over waarin wordt verklaard dat de belanghebbende in het genot is van werkloosheidsuitkeringen krachtens de wettelijke regeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij en dat hij recht zou hebben op gezinsuitkeringen indien hij met zijn gezinsleden op het grondgebied van de bevoegde Staat woonde. Dit bewijs wordt afgegeven hetzij door het voor werkloosheid bevoegde orgaan van laatstbedoelde Staat, hetzij door een ander door de bevoegde autoriteit van deze Staat aangewezen orgaan. Indien de gezinsleden dit bewijs niet overleggen, verzoekt het orgaan van de woonplaats daarom aan het bevoegde orgaan.   
2.  De artikelen 81 en 82 van het Akkoord zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing.   

### TITEL  VI  

####Diverse bepalingen

### Artikel  84  

Het orgaan van de woonplaats van een persoon die ten onrechte prestaties heeft genoten of het orgaan dat is aangewezen door de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan deze persoon woont, verleent zijn goede diensten aan het orgaan van elke andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat deze prestaties heeft verstrekt, indien laatstbedoeld orgaan verhaal op de betrokken persoon wil nemen.  

### Artikel  85  

1.  Indien bij de vaststelling of de herziening van uitkeringen bij invaliditeit, ouderdom of overlijden (pensioenen) krachtens Titel III, hoofdstuk 2 van het Verdrag, het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij aan een rechthebbende op uitkeringen een hoger bedrag heeft uitbetaald dan waarop deze recht heeft, kan dit orgaan aan het orgaan van enige andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat overeenkomstige uitkeringen aan deze rechthebbende verschuldigd is, verzoeken het teveel betaalde bedrag in te houden op de aan bedoelde rechthebbende verschuldigde achterstallige termijnen. Laatstbedoeld orgaan maakt het aldus ingehouden bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft. Indien de terugvordering niet met de achterstallige termijnen kan worden verrekend, is het volgende lid van toepassing.   
2.  Wanneer het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij aan een rechthebbende op uitkeringen een hoger bedrag heeft uitbetaald dan waarop hij recht heeft, kan dit orgaan, op de wijze en binnen de grenzen als bepaald in de door dit orgaan toegepaste wetgeving, aan het orgaan van enige andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat uitkeringen aan deze rechthebbende verschuldigd is, verzoeken het teveel betaalde bedrag in te houden op de bedragen welke het aan bedoelde rechthebbende betaalt. Laatstbedoeld orgaan houdt het bedrag in op de wijze en binnen de grenzen als voor een dergelijke verrekening is toegestaan bij de door dit orgaan toegepaste wetgeving, alsof het door dit orgaan zelf teveel betaalde bedragen betrof en maakt het aldus ingehouden bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft.   
3.  Wanneer het orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij voorschotten op uitkeringen heeft verleend voor een tijdvak waarover de rechthebbende recht had op overeenkomstige uitkeringen krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, kan dit orgaan aan het orgaan van de andere Partij verzoeken het bedrag van deze voorschotten in te houden op de bedragen welke het voor hetzelfde tijdvak aan bedoelde rechthebbende verschuldigd is. Laatstbedoeld orgaan gaat tot deze inhouding over en maakt het aldus ingehouden bedrag over aan het orgaan dat de vordering heeft.   

### Artikel  86  

Wanneer een persoon op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij sociale bijstand heeft genoten gedurende een tijdvak waarover hij krachtens de wetgeving van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij recht op uitkeringen had, kan de instelling welke de sociale bijstand heeft verleend, indien deze een wettelijk verhaalsrecht heeft op uitkeringen welke verschuldigd zijn aan personen die sociale bijstand genieten, aan het orgaan van enige andere Verdragsluitende Partij dat uitkeringen aan de betrokken persoon verschuldigd is, verzoeken het bedrag van de over genoemd tijdvak verleende sociale bijstand in te houden op de bedragen welke het aan bedoelde persoon betaalt. Laatstbedoeld orgaan gaat tot deze inhouding over en maakt het aldus ingehouden bedrag over aan de instelling welke de vordering heeft.  

### Artikel  87  

1.  Ingeval het recht op verstrekkingen niet door het als bevoegd aangeduide orgaan wordt erkend, worden de verstrekkingen welke door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats werden verleend op grond van de in artikel 20, tweede lid of artikel 55, tweede lid van het Akkoord geopperde veronderstelling, door eerstbedoeld orgaan vergoed.   
2.  De door het orgaan van de woonplaats of door het orgaan van de verblijfplaats verrichte uitgaven voor krachtens artikel 60, eerste lid van het Akkoord verleende verstrekkingen, terwijl de belanghebbende geen recht op verstrekkingen heeft, worden vergoed door het orgaan dat door de bevoegde autoriteit van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij is aangewezen.   
3.  Het orgaan dat onverschuldigd verleende verstrekkingen heeft vergoed krachtens het eerste of tweede lid van dit artikel, behoudt op de persoon die verstrekkingen heeft genoten een schuldvordering welke gelijk is aan de waarde van de onverschuldigd verleende verstrekkingen.   

### Artikel  88  

Ingeval tussen de organen of de bevoegde autoriteiten van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen een geschil bestaat hetzij over de wetgeving welke krachtens Titel II van het Verdrag moet worden toegepast, hetzij over de vaststelling van het orgaan dat prestaties moet verlenen, ontvangt de belanghebbende die aanspraak op prestaties zou kunnen maken indien dit geschil niet bestond, voorlopig de prestaties welke in de door het orgaan van de woonplaats toegepaste wetgeving zijn voorzien of, indien de belanghebbende niet op het grondgebied van een der betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen woont, de prestaties welke zijn voorzien in de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij waaraan hij tevoren en laatstelijk onderworpen is geweest. Nadat het geschil is beslecht komen de prestaties welke voorlopig zijn verleend, voor rekening van het orgaan dat bevoegd is verklaard voor het verlenen van de prestaties.  

### Artikel  89  

Indien het bevoegde orgaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij het, met het oog op de toepassing van zijn wetgeving of van het Verdrag, in bepaalde gevallen noodzakelijk acht dat een onderzoek wordt ingesteld op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, kan het daartoe een met het onderzoek belaste persoon aanwijzen, nadat de bevoegde autoriteiten van de beide betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen hierover overeenstemming hebben bereikt. De bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan het onderzoek plaatsvindt, verleent zijn medewerking aan de met het onderzoek belaste persoon, in het bijzonder door iemand aan te wijzen die hem terzijde moet staan bij de raadpleging van de processenverbaal en van alle andere stukken welke op het betreffende geval betrekking hebben.  

### Artikel  90  

Indien de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Partij uitsluitend als gezinsleden of huisgenoten beschouwt de personen die bij de belanghebbende inwonen, kan het orgaan dat deze wetgeving toepast, verlangen dat de omstandigheid dat deze gezinsleden of huisgenoten, wanneer zij niet aan deze voorwaarde voldoen, in hoofdzaak op kosten van de belanghebbende worden onderhouden, wordt bewezen door middel van stukken waaruit blijkt dat de belanghebbende in belangrijke mate in hun onderhoud voorziet.  

### Artikel  91  

Van overeenkomsten welke worden gesloten krachtens artikel 26, eerste lid, artikel 32, derde of zesde lid, artikel 41, artikel 42, derde lid, artikel 46, vijfde lid, artikel 56, eerste lid, artikel 58, eerste lid, artikel 67, tweede lid, artikel 69, derde lid, artikel 70, tweede of derde lid van het Verdrag, alsmede krachtens artikel 5 van het Akkoord, wordt binnen drie maanden nadat ze in werking zijn getreden mededeling gedaan aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa.  

### Artikel  92
