##Verdrag inzake de voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee ten gevolge van het storten van afval en andere stoffen

####Convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter

The Contracting Parties to this Convention, Recognizing that the marine environment and the living organisms which it supports are of vital importance to humanity, and all people have an interest in assuring that it is so managed that its quality and resources are not impaired; Recognizing that the capacity of the sea to assimilate wastes and render them harmless, and its ability to regenerate natural resources, is not unlimited; Recognizing that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction; Recalling Resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the principles governing the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction; Noting that marine pollution originates in many sources, such as dumping and discharges through the atmosphere, rivers, estuaries, outfalls and pipelines, and that it is important that States use the best practicable means to prevent such pollution and develop products and processes which will reduce the amount of harmful wastes to be disposed of; Being convinced that international action to control the pollution of the sea by dumping can and must be taken without delay but that this action should not preclude discussion of measures to control other sources of marine pollution as soon as possible; and Wishing to improve protection of the marine environment by encouraging States with a common interest in particular geographical areas to enter into appropriate agreements supplementary to this Convention; Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

Contracting Parties shall individually and collectively promote the effective control of all sources of pollution of the marine environment, and pledge themselves especially to take all practicable steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by the dumping of waste and other matter that is liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.  

### Article  II  

Contracting Parties shall, as provided for in the following Articles, take effective measures individually, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, and collectively, to prevent marine pollution caused by dumping and shall harmonize their policies in this regard.  

### Article  III  

For the purposes of this Convention: 

1. 
(a) "Dumping" means: 

(i) any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;  

(ii) any deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea.    

(b) "Dumping" does not include: 

(i) the disposal at sea of wastes or other matter incidental to, or derived from the normal operations of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea and their equipment, other than wastes or other matter transported by or to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, operating for the purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from the treatment of such wastes or other matter on such vessels, aircraft, platforms or structures;  

(ii) placement of matter for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not contrary to the aims of this Convention.    

(c) The disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from, or related to the exploration, exploitation and associated offshore processing of sea-bed mineral resources will not be overed by the provisions of this Convention.    

2. "Vessels and aircraft" means waterborne or airborne craft of any type whatsoever. This expression includes air cushioned craft and floating craft, whether self-propelled or not.  

3. "Sea" means all marine waters other than the internal waters of States.

6. "General permit" means permission granted in advance and in accordance with Annex III.  

7. "The Organisation" means the Organisation designated by the Contracting Parties in accordance with Article XIV (2).    

### Article  IV  

1.  In accordance with the provisions of this Convention Contracting Parties shall prohibit the dumping of any wastes or other matter in whatever form or condition except as otherwise specified below: 

(a) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in Annex I is prohibited;  

(b) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in Annex II requires a prior special permit;  

(c) the dumping of all other wastes or matter requires a prior general permit.     
2.  Any permit shall be issued only after careful consideration of all the factors set forth in Annex III, including prior studies of the characteristics of the dumping site as set forth in Sections B and C of that Annex.   
3.  No provision of this Convention is to be interpreted as preventing a Contracting Party from prohibiting, insofar as that Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not mentioned in Annex I. That Party shall notify such measures to the Organisation.   

### Article  V  

1.  The provisions of Article IV shall not apply when it is necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of *force majeure* caused by stress of weather, or in any case which constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping will be less than would otherwise occur. Such dumping shall be so conducted as to minimise the likelihood of damage to human or marine life and shall be reported forthwith to the Organisation.   
2.  A Contracting Party may issue a special permit as an exception to Article IV (1) (a), in emergencies, posing unacceptable risk relating to human health and admitting no other feasible solution. Before doing so the Party shall consult any other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the Organisation which, after consulting other Parties, and international organisations as appropriate, shall in accordance with Article XIV promptly recommend to the Party the most appropriate procedures to adopt. The Party shall follow these recommendations to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the time within which action must be taken and with the general obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and shall inform the Organisation of the action it takes. The Parties pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.

####Verdrag inzake de voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee ten gevolge van het storten van afval en andere stoffen

De Verdragsluitende Partijen bij dit Verdrag, Erkennende dat het mariene milieu en de daarvan levende organismen van uitzonderlijk gewicht zijn voor de mensheid en dat de gehele mensheid er belang bij heeft dat dit milieu zodanig wordt beheerd dat zijn eigenschappen en zijn bronnen niet worden aangetast; Erkennende dat het vermogen van de zee afval op te nemen en onschadelijk te maken en haar mogelijkheden om het leven van de natuurlijke bronnen te hernieuwen niet onbegrensd zijn; Erkennende dat de Staten, krachtens het Handvest der Verenigde Naties en de beginselen van het volkenrecht, het soevereine recht hebben hun eigen bronnen te exploiteren volgens hun eigen milieubeleid en dat het hun plicht is er op toe te zien dat de binnen hun rechtsmacht of onder hun controle uitgeoefende werkzaamheden geen schade berokkenen aan het milieu van andere Staten of van buiten hun nationale rechtsgebied gelegen gebieden; Herinnerend aan Resolutie 2749 (XXV) van de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties inzake de beginselen die van toepassing zijn op de buiten de nationale rechtsmacht gelegen zee- en oceaanbodem en de ondergrond daarvan; Vaststellende dat de verontreiniging van de zee talrijke oorzaken heeft, zoals het storten en het lozen via dampkring, rivieren, estuaria, open afvoeren en pijpleidingen, en dat het van belang is dat de Staten de daarvoor het meest in aanmerking komende middelen aanwenden ter voorkoming van zodanige verontreiniging en produkten en methoden ontwikkelen die de hoeveelheid te vernietigen schadelijk afval beperken; Ervan overtuigd dat internationale maatregelen onverwijld kunnen en moeten worden genomen ten einde de verontreiniging van de zee ten gevolge van het storten te bestrijden, maar dat dit een onderzoek van maatregelen ter bestrijding van andere bronnen van verontreiniging zodra dit mogelijk is niet moet verhinderen; en Vervuld van de wens de bescherming van het mariene milieu te verbeteren, door de Staten die in bepaalde geografische gebieden een gemeenschappelijk belang hebben, aan te moedigen daartoe geëigende overeenkomsten te sluiten ter aanvulling van dit Verdrag; Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

De Verdragsluitende Partijen dienen afzonderlijk en gezamenlijk te bevorderen dat alle bronnen van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu onder controle blijven en zij verbinden zich in het bijzonder te streven naar het nemen van alle mogelijke maatregelen ter voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee door het storten van afval en andere stoffen die de gezondheid van de mens in gevaar kunnen brengen, schade kunnen berokkenen aan de in de zee voorkomende fauna en flora, een aantasting kunnen vormen van de mogelijkheden tot recreatie of een ander rechtmatig gebruik van de zee kunnen verhinderen.  

### Artikel  II  

De Verdragsluitende Partijen nemen, overeenkomstig de hierna volgende artikelen, zowel afzonderlijk, al naar gelang van hun wetenschappelijke, technische en economische mogelijkheden, als gezamenlijk alle passende maatregelen ter voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee ten gevolge van het storten en zij harmoniseren hun beleid in dit opzicht.  

### Artikel  III  

In dit Verdrag: 

1. 

(a) betekent „storten": 

(i) het zich op zee opzettelijk ontdoen van afval en andere stoffen vanuit schepen of luchtvaartuigen, of vanaf platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee;  

(ii) het in zee tot zinken brengen van schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee;    

(b) wordt onder „storten" niet begrepen: 

(i) het zich op zee ontdoen van afval of andere stoffen behorende bij of afkomstig van de normale exploitatie van schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee en van hun uitrusting, waaronder niet begrepen zijn afval en andere stoffen die worden vervoerd door of overgeladen op schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee, gebruikt om zich van deze stoffen te ontdoen, of stoffen die afkomstig zijn van de verwerking van dergelijk afval of andere stoffen aan boord van deze schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken;  

(ii) het deponeren van stoffen met een ander oogmerk dan er zich enkel en alleen van te ontdoen mits zulks niet strijdig is met het doel van dit Verdrag;    

(c) valt het zich ontdoen van afval of andere stoffen, onmiddellijk of middellijk afkomstig van de exploratie, de ontginning en de verwerking op zee van mineralen die zich in de zeebodem bevinden, niet onder de bepalingen van dit Verdrag;    

2. betekent „schepen en luchtvaartuigen" vaartuigen die zich op het water, in het water of in de lucht voortbewegen, onverschillig van welk type zij zijn. Hieronder zijn mede begrepen luchtkussenvaartuigen, drijvende voorwerpen, al dan niet met eigen voortstuwingsvermogen;  

3. betekent „zee" alle mariene wateren met uitzondering van de binnenwateren van de Staten;  

4. betekent „afval en andere stoffen" materialen en substanties, onverschillig hun aard, vorm of beschrijving;  

5. betekent „bijzondere vergunning" de toestemming die voor ieder afzonderlijk geval wordt verleend op een van tevoren ingediend verzoek, zulks overeenkomstig het bepaalde in de Bijlagen II en III;  

6. betekent „algemene vergunning" de toestemming die van tevoren wordt verleend overeenkomstig het bepaalde in Bijlage III;  

7. betekent „Organisatie" de instelling die door de Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt aangewezen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in Artikel XIV, tweede lid.    

### Artikel  IV  

1.  Overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit Verdrag verbiedt elke Verdragsluitende Partij het storten van alle afval of andere stoffen in welke vorm en onder welke omstandigheden dan ook, met inachtneming van de hierna volgende bepalingen: 

(a) het storten van alle afval of stoffen genoemd in Bijlage I is verboden;  

(b) voor het storten van afval of andere stoffen genoemd in Bijlage II is een van tevoren verleende bijzondere vergunning vereist;  

(c) voor het storten van alle andere afval en stoffen is een van tevoren verleende algemene vergunning vereist.     
2.  Een vergunning wordt slechts verleend, nadat een nauwkerig onderzoek is ingesteld naar alle factoren genoemd in Bijlage III, met inbegrip van een voorafgaand onderzoek van de kenmerken van de stortplaats overeenkomstig het bepaalde in de paragrafen B en C van die Bijlage.   
3.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag mag worden uitgelegd als beletsel voor een Verdragsluitende Partij om, wat haar betreft, het storten van afval en stoffen welke niet in Bijlage I zijn genoemd te verbieden. Die Partij geeft de Organisatie kennis van de te dien aanzien genomen maatregelen.   

### Artikel  V  

1.  Het bepaalde in Artikel IV is niet van toepassing wanneer het noodzakelijk is voor de bescherming van mensenlevens of voor de veiligheid van schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee in geval van overmacht ten gevolge van noodweer of in alle andere gevallen waarin mensenlevens in gevaar zijn of een ernstige bedreiging bestaat voor schepen, luchtvaartuigen, platforms of andere bouwwerken in zee, mits het ernaar uitziet dat het storten de enige oplossing is om de dreiging af te wenden en hierdoor naar alle waarschijnlijkheid de minste schade wordt veroorzaakt. Het storten moet dan dusdanig geschieden dat de gevaren voor het menselijk leven en voor de in zee voorkomende flora en fauna tot een minimum beperkt blijven. De Organisatie dient onverwijld van het storten in kennis te worden gesteld.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij mag, in afwijking van Artikel IV, eerste lid, letter a, een bijzondere vergunning verlenen in noodgevallen die voor de menselijke gezondheid onaanvaardbare risico's met zich brengen en waarvoor geen andere oplossing mogelijk is. Alvorens hiertoe over te gaan, raadpleegt de Partij ieder ander land of landen die erbij betrokken zouden kunnen zijn, alsmede de Organisatie die, na de andere Partijen en de daarvoor in aanmerking komende internationale organisaties te hebben geraadpleegd, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel XIV, de Partij zo spoedig mogelijk aanbevelingen doet omtrent de te volgen werkwijzen die het meest geschikt zijn. De Partij volgt deze aanbevelingen zoveel mogelijk op, binnen de tijd waarin de nodige maatregelen moeten worden genomen, en rekening houdend met de algemene verplichting het veroorzaken van schade aan het mariene milieu te vermijden; zij geeft de Organisatie kennis van de door haar genomen maatregelen. De Partijen verbinden zich elkaar in zodanige situatie onderling bijstand te verlenen.   
3.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan bij de bekrachtiging van of bij de toetreding tot dit Verdrag van haar in het tweede lid bedoelde rechten afzien.   

### Artikel  VI  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij wijst één of meer autoriteiten aan die bevoegd zijn tot: 

(a) het verlenen van bijzondere vergunningen die voorafgaande aan de storting vereist zijn voor het storten van de in Bijlage II genoemde stoffen en in de in Artikel V, tweede lid, omschreven omstandigheden;  

(b) het verlenen van algemene vergunningen die voorafgaande aan de storting vereist zijn voor het storten van alle andere stoffen;  

(c) het bijhouden van lijsten, waarop de aard en de hoeveelheden van alle stoffen die gestort mogen worden, alsmede de plaats, de datum en de wijze van storten worden vermeld;  

(d) het afzonderlijk of in samenwerking met andere Partijen en de bevoegde international organisaties verrichten van controlemetingen betreffende de toestand van de zeeën ten behoeve van de uitvoering van dit Verdrag.     
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit of autoriteiten van een Verdragsluitende Partij zullen voorafgaand aan de storting de algemene of bijzondere vergunningen verlenen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste lid hierboven voor de te storten stoffen: 

(a) die geladen worden op haar grondgebied;  

(b) die geladen worden door een schip of een luchtvaartuig dat op haar grondgebied staat ingeschreven of dat haar vlag voert, wanneer het laden plaatsvindt op het grondgebied van een Staat die geen Partij is bij dit Verdrag.     
3.  Bij het verlenen van de hierboven onder het eerste lid, letters (a) en (b), bedoelde vergunningen handelt de bevoegde autoriteit of handelen de bevoegde autoriteiten overeenkomstig het bepaalde in Bijlage III en overeenkomstig de aanvullende criteria, maatregelen en voorwaarden die zij ter zake dienende acht, respectievelijk achten.

### DEEL  I  

### Voorschrift  1  

####Begripsomschrijvingen

Voor de toepassing van dit Addendum: 

(1) wordt onder „verbrandingsinrichting op zee" verstaan een schip, een platform of een ander bouwwerk dat wordt gebruikt voor verbranding op zee;  

(2) wordt onder „verbranding op zee" verstaan het opzettelijk verbranden van afval of andere stoffen in verbrandingsinrichtingen op zee met het doel deze stoffen door middel van hitte te vernietigen. Werkzaamheden die behoren bij de normale exploitatie van schepen, platforms of andere bouwwerken vallen niet onder deze begripsomschrijving.    

### Voorschrift  2  

####Toepassing

1.  Deel II van deze Voorschriften is van toepassing op afval of andere stoffen zoals hieronder bedoeld: 

(a) afval of andere stoffen bedoeld in paragraaf 1 van Bijlage I;  

(b) pesticiden en bijprodukten daarvan die niet vallen onder Bijlage I.     
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen moeten eerst nagaan of er uitvoerbare andere methoden beschikbaar zijn om het afval of de andere stoffen op het land te verwerken, te storten of te vernietigen dan wel of er uitvoerbare andere methoden beschikbaar zijn om deze minder schadelijk te maken, alvorens een vergunning af te geven voor verbranding op zee overeenkomstig deze Voorschriften.

4.  Voor verbranding op zee van afval of andere stoffen waarnaar niet wordt verwezen in het eerste en het derde lid van dit Voorschrift, is een algemene vergunning vereist.   
5.  Voor de afgifte van vergunningen bedoeld in het derde en vierde lid van dit Voorschrift, houden de Verdragsluitende Partijen, ten aanzien van het te verbranden afval, ten volle rekening met alle van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van deze Voorschriften en de technische richtlijnen ter regulering van verbranding van afval en andere stoffen op zee.   

### DEEL  II  

### Voorschrift  3  

####Goedkeuring en inspecties van het verbrandingssysteem

1.  Het verbrandingssysteem voor iedere voorgestelde verbrandingsinrichting op zee wordt onderworpen aan de hieronder omschreven inspecties. Overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel VII, eerste lid, van het Verdrag, verzekert de Verdragsluitende Partij die voornemens is een verbrandingsvergunning af te geven dat de inspecties van de te gebruiken verbrandingsinrichting op zee zijn uitgevoerd en dat het verbrandingssysteem voldoet aan het bepaalde in deze Voorschriften. Indien de eerste inspectie is uitgevoerd onder leiding van een Verdragsluitende Partij, dan wordt door deze Partij een bijzondere vergunning afgegeven waarin staan vermeld de vereisten waaraan de inrichting bij het onderzoek moest voldoen. De resultaten van iedere inspectie worden neergelegd in een inspectierapport. 

(a) Een eerste inspectie wordt uitgevoerd ten einde te verzekeren dat bij de verbranding van afval of andere stoffen het verbrandingsen vernietigingsrendement meer dan 99,9 procent bedraagt.  

(b) Als onderdeel van de eerste inspectie moet de Staat onder leiding waarvan de inspectie wordt uitgevoerd: 

(i) de plaats van opstelling, het type en de wijze van gebruik van apparatuur voor het meten van de temperatuur goedkeuren;  

(ii) het systeem waarmee gasmonsters worden genomen, met inbegrip van plaatsen van monstername, analyse-apparatuur en de wijze van registratie, goedkeuren;  

(iii) verzekeren dat goedgekeurde apparatuur is opgesteld die de toevoer van afval naar de verbrandingsinrichting automatisch afsluit indien de temperatuur beneden goedgekeurde minimumwaarden daalt;  

(iv) verzekeren dat het niet mogelijk is zich te ontdoen van afval of andere stoffen uit de verbrandingsinrichting op zee behalve door middel van de verbrandingsinrichting bij normaal gebruik;  

(v) de apparatuur waarmee de toevoersnelheid van afval en brandstof wordt gecontroleerd en geregistreerd, goedkeuren;  

(vi) de werking van het verbrandingssysteem verifiëren door intensieve controlemetingen boven in de schoorsteen uit te voeren, waarbij onder meer metingen worden verricht naar O <sub>2</sub>, CO, CO <sub>2</sub>, gehalogeneerde organische stoffen en totale koolwaterstoffen, bij welke proeven afval wordt gebruikt dat typerend is voor het afval dat zal worden verbrand.    

(c) Het verbrandingssysteem wordt ten minste om de twee jaar geïnspecteerd om te verzekeren dat de verbrandingsinrichting blijft voldoen aan deze Voorschriften. Bij de tweejaarlijkse inspectie zal worden uitgegaan van een evaluatie van de exploitatiegegevens en de onderhoudsregistratie over de voorgaande twee jaren.     
2.  Na de bevredigende uitvoering van een inspectie wordt door een Verdragsluitende Partij een bewijs van goedkeuring afgegeven indien is vastgesteld dat het verbrandingssysteem voldoet aan deze Voorschriften. Een afschrift van het inspectierapport wordt aan het bewijs van goedkeuring gehecht. Een bewijs van goedkeuring dat is afgegeven door een Verdragsluitende Partij wordt door de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen erkend, tenzij er duidelijke redenen bestaan om aan te nemen dat het verbrandingssysteem niet voldoet aan deze Voorschriften. Een afschrift van ieder bewijs van goedkeuring en van ieder inspectierapport wordt ingediend bij de Organisatie.   
3.  Nadat een inspectie is uitgevoerd, mogen zonder goedkeuring van de Verdragsluitende Partij die het bewijs van goedkeuring heeft afgegeven, geen veranderingen van betekenis worden aangebracht waardoor de werking van het verbrandingssysteem zou kunnen worden aangetast.   

### Voorschrift  4  

####Afval waarvoor nader onderzoek is vereist

1.  Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij eraan twijfelt of het te verbranden afval of de te verbranden andere stoffen door middel van hitte kunnen worden vernietigd, worden eerst op kleine schaal proeven uitgevoerd.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij voornemens is een vergunning te verlenen voor het verbranden van afval of andere stoffen ten aanzien waarvan twijfels bestaan omtrent de volledigheid van de verbranding, wordt het verbrandingssysteem onderworpen aan dezelfde intensieve controlemetingen boven in de schoorsteen van het verbrandingssysteem als zijn vereist voor de eerste inspectie van het verbrandingssysteem. Aandacht moet worden besteed aan de bemonstering van deeltjes, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de vaste bestanddelen van het afval.   
3.  Als goedgekeurde minimum vlamtemperatuur geldt de temperatuur die is aangegeven in Voorschrift 5, tenzij bij de proeven met de verbrandingsinrichting op zee is gebleken dat het vereiste verbrandings- en vernietigingsrendement kan worden bereikt bij een lagere temperatuur.   
4.  De resultaten van bijzondere onderzoeken bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid van dit Voorschrift worden vastgelegd en als bijlage aan het inspectierapport gehecht. Een afschrift hiervan wordt aan de Organisatie toegezonden.   

### Voorschrift  5  

####Eisen ten aanzien van de exploitatie

1.  De bedrijfsvoering van het verbrandingssysteem moet zodanig geschieden dat verzekerd is dat de verbranding van afval of andere stoffen geschiedt bij een vlamtemperatuur van minstens 1250° C, behalve in het geval bedoeld in Voorschrift 4.   
2.  Het verbrandingsrendement moet ten minste 99,95 *±* 0,05% bedragen, uitgaande van:   ![10000049057](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000049057)

(e) de concentratie van CO en CO <sub>2</sub> in verbrandingsgassen;  

(f) de koers en de snelheid van het schip.     
2.  De bewijzen van goedkeuring en de afschriften van de inspectierapporten, die overeenkomstig Voorschrift 3 zijn afgegeven c.q. opgesteld, alsmede de afschriften van de verbrandingsvergunningen die zijn afgegeven door een Verdragsluitende Partij voor in een verbrandingsinrichting te verbranden afval of andere stoffen worden bewaard op de verbrandingsinrichting op zee.   

### Voorschrift  7  

####Controle op de aard van het te verbranden afval

De aanvrage voor een vergunning voor het verbranden van afval of andere stoffen op zee moet zoveel informatie over de eigenschappen van het afval of de andere stoffen omvatten dat wordt voldaan aan de vereisten van Voorschrift 9.  

### Voorschrift  8  

####Verbrandingsgebieden

1.  Bij het vaststellen van de criteria voor het kiezen van verbrandingsgebieden wordt, behalve met de bepalingen genoemd in Bijlage III bij het Verdrag, rekening gehouden met het volgende: 

(a) de voor de verspreidingsmogelijkheden bepalende atmosferische kenmerken van het gebied, zoals windsnelheid en -richting, stabiliteit van de atmosfeer, de veelvuldigheid waarmee zich inversie-verschijnselen en mist voordoen, soort en hoeveelheid neerslag, luchtvochtigheid, ten einde te kunnen vaststellen welke invloed de uit de verbrandingsinrichting op zee vrijkomende verontreinigingen zouden kunnen hebben op het omringende milieu, waarbij bijzondere aandacht wordt besteed aan de mogelijkheid dat verontreinigingen door de atmosfeer naar kustgebieden worden gevoerd;  

(b) de voor de verspreidingsmogelijkheden bepalende kenmerken van het zeegebied ten einde vast te stellen wat de mogelijke invloed van interactie tussen de rookpluim en het wateroppervlak is;  

(c) de aanwezigheid van hulpmiddelen voor de navigatie.     
2.  Aan de coördinaten van de blijvend aangewezen verbrandingsgebieden zal ruime bekendheid worden gegeven; zij zullen worden medegedeeld aan de Organisatie.
