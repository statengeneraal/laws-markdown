### PART  II  

####TERRITORIAL SEA AND CONTIGUOUS ZONE

### SECTION  1  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  2  

####Legal status of the territorial sea, of the air space over the territorial sea and of its bed and subsoil

1.  The sovereignty of a coastal State extends, beyond its land territory and internal waters and, in the case of an archipelagic State, its archipelagic waters, to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea.   
2.  This sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.   
3.  The sovereignty over the territorial sea is exercised subject to this Convention and to other rules of international law.   

### SECTION  2  

####LIMITS OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA

### Article  3  

####Breadth of the territorial sea

Every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from baselines determined in accordance with this Convention.  

### Article  4  

####Outer limit of the territorial sea

The outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the breadth of the territorial sea.  

### Article  5  

####Normal baseline

Except where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State.  

### Article  6  

####Reefs

In the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing reefs, the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate symbol on charts officially recognized by the coastal State.  

### Article  7  

####Straight baselines

1.  In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.   
2.  Where because of the presence of a delta and other natural conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may be selected along the furthest seaward extent of the low-water line and, notwithstanding subsequent regression of the low-water line, the straight baselines shall remain effective until changed by the coastal State in accordance with this Convention.   
3.  The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.   
4.  Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or except in instances where the drawing of baselines to and from such elevations has received general international recognition.   
5.  Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage.   
6.  The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.   

### Article  8  

####Internal waters

1.  Except as provided in Part IV, waters on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the State.   
2.  Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the method set forth in article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal waters areas which had not previously been considered as such, a right of innocent passage as provided in this Convention shall exist in those waters.   

### Article  9  

####Mouths of rivers

If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a straight line across the mouth of the river between points on the low-water line of its banks.  

### Article  10  

####Bays

1.  This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a single State.   
2.  For the purposes of this Convention, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.   
3.  For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points. Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths. Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation.   
4.  If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, a closing line may be drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby shall be considered as internal waters.   
5.  Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay exceeds 24 nautical miles, a straight baseline of 24 nautical miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length.   
6.  The foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called ”historic” bays, or in any case where the system of straight baselines provided for in article 7 is applied.   

### Article  11  

####Ports

For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system are regarded as forming part of the coast. Off-shore installations and artificial islands shall not be considered as permanent harbour works.  

### Article  12  

####Roadsteads

Roadsteads which are normally used for the loading, unloading and anchoring of ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or partly outside the outer limit of the territorial sea, are included in the territorial sea.  

### Article  13  

####Low-tide elevations

1.  A low-tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide. Where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, the low-water line on that elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea.   
2.  Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, it has no territorial sea of its own.   

### Article  14  

####Combination of methods for determining baselines

The coastal State may determine baselines in turn by any of the methods provided for in the foregoing articles to suit different conditions.  

### Article  15  

####Delimitation of the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts

Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance therewith.  

### Article  16  

####Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates

1.  The baselines for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea determined in accordance with articles 7, 9 and 10, or the limits derived therefrom, and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with articles 12 and 15 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, a list of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted.   
2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   

### SECTION  3

### PART  III  

####STRAITS USED FOR INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION

### SECTION  1  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  34  

####Legal status of waters forming straits used for international navigation

1.  The regime of passage through straits used for international navigation established in this Part shall not in other respects affect the legal status of the waters forming such straits or the exercise by the States bordering the straits of their sovereignty or jurisdiction over such waters and their air space, bed and subsoil.   
2.  The sovereignty or jurisdiction of the States bordering the straits is exercised subject to this Part and to other rules of international law.   

### Article  35  

####Scope of this Part

Nothing in this Part affects: 

(a) any areas of internal waters within a strait, except where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the method set forth in article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal waters areas which had not previously been considered as such;  

(b) the legal status of the waters beyond the territorial seas of States bordering straits as exclusive economic zones or high seas; or  

(c) the legal regime in straits in which passage is regulated in whole or in part by long-standing international conventions in force specifically relating to such straits.    

### Article  36  

####High seas routes or routes through exclusive economic zones through straits used for international navigation

This Part does not apply to a strait used for international navigation if there exists through the strait a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics; in such routes, the other relevant Parts of this Convention, including the provisions regarding the freedoms of navigation and overflight, apply.  

### SECTION  2  

####TRANSIT PASSAGE

### Article  37  

####Scope of this section

This section applies to straits which are used for international navigation between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.  

### Article  38  

####Right of transit passage

1.  In straits referred to in article 37, all ships and aircraft enjoy the right of transit passage, which shall not be impeded; except that, if the strait is formed by an island of a State bordering the strait and its mainland, transit passage shall not apply if there exists seaward of the island a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics.   
2.  Transit passage means the exercise in accordance with this Part of the freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit of the strait between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone. However, the requirement of continuous and expeditious transit does not preclude passage through the strait for the purpose of entering, leaving or returning from a State bordering the strait, subject to the conditions of entry to that State.   
3.  Any activity which is not an exercise of the right of transit passage through a strait remains subject to the other applicable provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  39  

####Duties of ships and aircraft during transit passage

1.  Ships and aircraft, while exercising the right of transit passage, shall: 

(a) proceed without delay through or over the strait;  

(b) refrain from any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of States bordering the strait, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;  

(c) refrain from any activities other than those incident to their normal modes of continuous and expeditious transit unless rendered necessary by *force majeure* or by distress;  

(d) comply with other relevant provisions of this Part.     
2.  Ships in transit passage shall: 

(a) comply with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices for safety at sea, including the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea;  

(b) comply with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from ships.     
3.  Aircraft in transit passage shall: 

(a) observe the Rules of the Air established by the International Civil Aviation Organization as they apply to civil aircraft; state aircraft will normally comply with such safety measures and will at all times operate with due regard for the safety of navigation;  

(b) at all times monitor the radio frequency assigned by the competent internationally designated air traffic control authority or the appropriate international distress radio frequency.     

### Article  40  

####Research and survey activities

During transit passage, foreign ships, including marine scientific research and hydrographic survey ships, may not carry out any research or survey activities without the prior authorization of the States bordering straits.  

### Article  41  

####Sea lanes and traffic separation schemes in straits used for international navigation

1.  In conformity with this Part, States bordering straits may designate sea lanes and prescribe traffic separation schemes for navigation in straits where necessary to promote the safe passage of ships.   
2.  Such States may, when circumstances require, and after giving due publicity thereto, substitute other sea lanes or traffic separation schemes for any sea lanes or traffic separation schemes previously designated or prescribed by them.   
3.  Such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes shall conform to generally accepted international regulations.   
4.  Before designating or substituting sea lanes or prescribing or substituting traffic separation schemes, States bordering straits shall refer proposals to the competent international organization with a view to their adoption. The organization may adopt only such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as may be agreed with the States bordering the straits, after which the States may designate, prescribe or substitute them.   
5.  In respect of a strait where sea lanes or traffic separation schemes through the waters of two or more States bordering the strait are being proposed, the States concerned shall co-operate in formulating proposals in consultation with the competent international organization.   
6.  States bordering straits shall clearly indicate all sea lanes and traffic separation schemes designated or prescribed by them on charts to which due publicity shall be given.   
7.  Ships in transit passage shall respect applicable sea lanes and traffic separation schemes established in accordance with this article.   

### Article  42  

####Laws and regulations of States bordering straits relating to transit passage

1.  Subject to the provisions of this section, States bordering straits may adopt laws and regulations relating to transit passage through straits, in respect of all or any of the following: 

(a) the safety of navigation and the regulation of maritime traffic, as provided in article 41;  

(b) the prevention, reduction and control of pollution, by giving effect to applicable international regulations regarding the discharge of oil, oily wastes and other noxious substances in the strait;

####ARCHIPELAGIC STATES

### Article  46  

####Use of terms

For the purposes of this Convention: 

(a) ”archipelagic State” means a State constituted wholly by one or more archipelagos and may include other islands;  

(b) ”archipelago” means a group of islands, including parts of islands, interconnecting waters and other natural features which are so closely interrelated that such islands, waters and other natural features form an intrinsic geographical, economic and political entity, or which historically have been regarded as such.    

### Article  47  

####Archipelagic baselines

1.  An archipelagic State may draw straight archipelagic baselines joining the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago provided that within such baselines are included the main islands and an area in which the ratio of the area of the water to the area of the land, including atolls, is between 1 to 1 and 9 to 1.   
2.  The length of such baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles, except that up to 3 per cent of the total number of baselines enclosing any archipelago may exceed that length, up to a maximum length of 125 nautical miles.   
3.  The drawing of such baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago.   
4.  Such baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the nearest island.   
5.  The system of such baselines shall not be applied by an archipelagic State in such a manner as to cut off from the high seas or the exclusive economic zone the territorial sea of another State.   
6.  If a part of the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic State lies between two parts of an immediately adjacent neighbouring State, existing rights and all other legitimate interests which the latter State has traditionally exercised in such waters and all rights stipulated by agreement between those States shall continue and be respected.   
7.  For the purpose of computing the ratio of water to land under paragraph 1, land areas may include waters lying within the fringing reefs of islands and atolls, including that part of a steep-sided oceanic plateau which is enclosed or nearly enclosed by a chain of limestone islands and drying reefs lying on the perimeter of the plateau.   
8.  The baselines drawn in accordance with this article shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, lists of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted.   
9.  The archipelagic State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   

### Article  48  

####Measurement of the breadth of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf

The breadth of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf shall be measured from archipelagic baselines drawn in accordance with article 47.  

### Article  49  

####Legal status of archipelagic waters, of the air space over archipelagic waters and of their bed and subsoil

1.  The sovereignty of an archipelagic State extends to the waters enclosed by the archipelagic baselines drawn in accordance with article 47, described as archipelagic waters, regardless of their depth or distance from the coast.   
2.  This sovereignty extends to the air space over the archipelagic waters, as well as to their bed and subsoil, and the resources contained therein.   
3.  This sovereignty is exercised subject to this Part.   
4.  The régime of archipelagic sea lanes passage established in this Part shall not in other respects affect the status of the archipelagic waters, including the sea lanes, or the exercise by the archipelagic State of its sovereignty over such waters and their air space, bed and subsoil, and the resources contained therein.   

### Article  50  

####Delimitation of internal waters

Within its archipelagic waters, the archipelagic State may draw closing lines for the delimitation of internal waters, in accordance with articles 9, 10 and 11.  

### Article  51  

####Existing agreements, traditional fishing rights and existing submarine cables

1.  Without prejudice to article 49, an archipelagic State shall respect existing agreements with other States and shall recognize traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighbouring States in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters. The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities, including the nature, the extent and the areas to which they apply, shall, at the request of any of the States concerned, be regulated by bilateral agreements between them. Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third States or their nationals.   
2.  An archipelagic State shall respect existing submarine cables laid by other States and passing through its waters without making a landfall. An archipelagic State shall permit the maintenance and replacement of such cables upon receiving due notice of their location and the intention to repair or replace them.   

### Article  52

2.  The archipelagic State may, without discrimination in form or in fact among foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of its archipelagic waters the innocent passage of foreign ships if such suspension is essential for the protection of its security. Such suspension shall take effect only after having been duly published.   

### Article  53  

####Right of archipelagic sea lanes passage

1.  An archipelagic State may designate sea lanes and air routes thereabove, suitable for the continuous and expeditious passage of foreign ships and aircraft through or over its archipelagic waters and the adjacent territorial sea.   
2.  All ships and aircraft enjoy the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage in such sea lanes and air routes.   
3.  Archipelagic sea lanes passage means the exercise in accordance with this Convention of the rights of navigation and overflight in the normal mode solely for the purpose of continuous, expeditious and unobstructed transit between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.   
4.  Such sea lanes and air routes shall traverse the archipelagic waters and the adjacent territorial sea and shall include all normal passage routes used as routes for international navigation or overflight through or over archipelagic waters and, within such routes, so far as ships are concerned, all normal navigational channels, provided that duplication of routes of similar convenience between the same entry and exit points shall not be necessary.   
5.  Such sea lanes and air routes shall be defined by a series of continuous axis lines from the entry points of passage routes to the exit points. Ships and aircraft in archipelagic sea lanes passage shall not deviate more than 25 nautical miles to either side of such axis lines during passage, provided that such ships and aircraft shall not navigate closer to the coasts than 10 per cent of the distance between the nearest points on islands bordering the sea lane.   
6.  An archipelagic State which designates sea lanes under this article may also prescribe traffic separation schemes for the safe passage of ships through narrow channels in such sea lanes.   
7.  An archipelagic State may, when circumstances require, after giving due publicity thereto, substitute other sea lanes or traffic separation schemes for any sea lanes or traffic separation schemes previously designated or prescribed by it.   
8.  Such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes shall conform to generally accepted international regulations.   
9.  In designating or substituting sea lanes or prescribing or substituting traffic separation schemes, an archipelagic State shall refer proposals to the competent international organization with a view to their adoption. The organization may adopt only such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as may be agreed with the archipelagic State, after which the archipelagic State may designate, prescribe or substitute them.   
10.  The archipelagic State shall clearly indicate the axis of the sea lanes and the traffic separation schemes designated or prescribed by it on charts to which due publicity shall be given.   
11.  Ships in archipelagic sea lanes passage shall respect applicable sea lanes and traffic separation schemes established in accordance with this article.   
12.  If an archipelagic State does not designate sea lanes or air routes, the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage may be exercised through the routes normally used for international navigation.   

### Article  54  

####Duties of ships and aircraft during their passage, research and survey activities, duties of the archipelagic State and laws and regulations of the archipelagic State relating to archipelagic sea lanes passage

### Article  75  

####Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates

1.  Subject to this Part, the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with article 74 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.   
2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   

### PART  VI  

####CONTINENTAL SHELF

### Article  76  

####Definition of the continental shelf

1.  The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.   
2.  The continental shelf of a-coastal State shall not extend beyond the limits provided for in paragraphs 4 to 6.   
3.  The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the land mass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.   
4.  

(a) For the purposes of this Convention, the coastal State shall establish the outer edge of the continental margin wherever the margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by either: 

(i) a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to the outermost fixed points at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1 per cent of the shortest distance from such point to the foot of the continental slope; or  

(ii) a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to fixed points not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental slope.    

(b) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the foot of the continental slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.     
5.  The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the continental shelf on the sea-bed, drawn in accordance with paragraph 4 (a) (i) and (ii) either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath, which is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres.   
6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, on submarine ridges, the outer limit of the continental shelf shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This paragraph does not apply to submarine elevations that are natural components of the continental margin, such as its plateaux, rises, caps, banks and spurs.   
7.  The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf, where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length, connecting fixed points, defined by co-ordinates of latitude and longitude.   
8.  Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation. The Commission shall make recommendations to coastal States on matters related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelf. The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding.   
9.  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information, including geodetic data, permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf. The Secretary-General shall give due publicity thereto.   
10.  The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts.   

### Article  77  

####Rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf

1.  The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.   
2.  The rights referred to in paragraph 1 are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities without the express consent of the coastal State.   
3.  The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation.   
4.  The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the sea-bed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the sea-bed or the subsoil.   

### Article  78  

####Legal status of the superjacent waters and air space and the rights and freedoms of other States

1.  The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters or of the air space above those waters.   
2.  The exercise of the rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf must not infringe or result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation and other rights and freedoms of other States as provided for in this Convention.   

### Article  79  

####Submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf

1.  All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of this article.   
2.  Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from pipelines, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables or pipelines.   
3.  The delineation of the course for the laying of such pipelines on the continental shelf is subject to the consent of the coastal State.   
4.  Nothing in this Part affects the right of the coastal State to establish conditions for cables or pipelines entering its territory or territorial sea, or its jurisdiction over cables and pipelines constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction.   
5.  When laying submarine cables or pipelines, States shall have due regard to cables or pipelines already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables or pipelines shall not be prejudiced.

The coastal State shall have the exclusive right to authorize and regulate drilling on the continental shelf for all purposes.  

### Article  82  

####Payments and contributions with respect to the exploitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles

1.  The coastal State shall make payments or contributions in kind in respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.   
2.  The payments and contributions shall be made annually with respect to all production at a site after the first five years of production at that site. For the sixth year, the rate of payment or contribution shall be 1 per cent of the value or volume of production at the site. The rate shall increase by 1 per cent for each subsequent year until the twelfth year and shall remain at 7 per cent thereafter. Production does not include resources used in connection with exploitation.   
3.  A developing State which is a net importer of a mineral resource produced from its continental shelf is exempt from making such payments or contributions in respect of that mineral resource.   
4.  The payments or contributions shall be made through the Authority, which shall distribute them to States Parties to this Convention, on the basis of equitable sharing criteria, taking into account the interests and needs of developing States, particularly the least developed and the land-locked among them.   

### Article  83  

####Delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts

1.  The delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solution.   
2.  If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, the States concerned shall resort to the procedures provided for in Part XV.   
3.  Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and co-operation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be without prejudice to the final delimitation.   
4.  Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned, questions relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.   

### Article  84  

####Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates

1.  Subject to this Part, the outer limit lines of the continental shelf and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with article 83 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.   
2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and, in the case of those showing the outer limit lines of the continental shelf, with the Secretary-General of the Authority.   

### Article  85  

####Tunnelling

This Part does not prejudice the right of the coastal State to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling, irrespective of the depth of water above the subsoil.  

### PART  VII

1.  Ships shall sail under the flag of one State only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this Convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas. A ship may not change its flag during a voyage or while in a port of call, save in the case of a real transfer of ownership or change of registry.   
2.  A ship which sails under the flags of two or more States, using them according to convenience, may not claim any of the nationalities in question with respect to any other State, and may be assimilated to a ship without nationality.   

### Article  93  

####Ships flying the flag of the United Nations, its specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency

The preceding articles do not prejudice the question of ships employed on the official service of the United Nations, its specialized agencies or the International Atomic Energy Agency, flying the flag of the organization.  

### Article  94

Upon receiving such a report, the flag State shall investigate the matter and, if appropriate, take any action necessary to remedy the situation.   
7.  Each State shall cause an inquiry to be held by or before a suitably qualified person or persons into every marine casualty or incident of navigation on the high seas involving a ship flying its flag and causing loss of life or serious injury to nationals of another State or serious damage to ships or installations of another State or to the marine environment. The flag State and the other State shall co-operate in the conduct of any inquiry held by that other State into any such marine casualty or incident of navigation.   

### Article  95  

####Immunity of warships on the high seas

Warships on the high seas have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any State other than the flag State.  

### Article  96  

####Immunity of ships used only on government non-commercial service

Ships owned or operated by a State and used only on government non-commercial service shall, on the high seas, have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any State other than the flag State.  

### Article  97  

####Penal jurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation

1.  In the event of a collision or any other incident of navigation concerning a ship on the high seas, involving the penal or disciplinary responsibility of the master or of any other person in the service of the ship, no penal or disciplinary proceedings may be instituted against such person except before the judicial or administrative authorities either of the flag State or of the State of which such person is a national.   
2.  In disciplinary matters, the State which has issued a master's certificate or a certificate of competence or licence shall alone be competent, after due legal process, to pronounce the withdrawal of such certificates, even if the holder is not a national of the State which issued them.   
3.  No arrest or detention of the ship, even as a measure of investigation, shall be ordered by any authorities other than those of the flag State.   

### Article  98  

####Duty to render assistance

1.  Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers: 

(a) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost;  

(b) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him;  

(c) after a collision, to render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, where possible, to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship, its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call.     
2.  Every coastal State shall promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and over the sea and, where circumstances so require, by way of mutual regional arrangements co-operate with neighbouring States for this purpose.   

### Article  99  

####Prohibition of the transport of slaves

Every State shall take effective measures to prevent and punish the transport of slaves in ships authorized to fly its flag and to prevent the unlawful use of its flag for that purpose. Any slave taking refuge on board any ship, whatever its flag, shall *ipso facto* be free.  

### Article  100  

####Duty to co-operate in the repression of piracy

All States shall co-operate to the fullest possible extent in the repression of piracy on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State.  

### Article  101  

####Definition of piracy

Piracy consists of any of the following acts: 

(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed: 

(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;  

(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;    

(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;  

(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).    

### Article  102  

####Piracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied

The acts of piracy, as defined in article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.  

### Article  103  

####Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft

A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.  

### Article  104  

####Retention or loss of the nationality of a pirate ship or aircraft

A ship or aircraft may retain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or aircraft. The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the law of the State from which such nationality was derived.  

### Article  105  

####Seizure of a pirate ship or aircraft

On the high seas, or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State, every State may seize a pirate ship or aircraft, or a ship or aircraft taken by piracy and under the control of pirates, and arrest the persons and seize the property on board. The courts of the State which carried out the seizure may decide upon the penalties to be imposed, and may also determine the action to be taken with regard to the ships, aircraft or property, subject to the rights of third parties acting in good faith.  

### Article  106  

####Liability for seizure without adequate grounds

Where the seizure of a ship or aircraft on suspicion of piracy has been effected without adequate grounds, the State making the seizure shall be liable to the State the nationality of which is possessed by the ship or aircraft for any loss or damage caused by the seizure.  

### Article  107  

####Ships and aircraft which are entitled to seize on account of piracy

A seizure on account of piracy may be carried out only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect.  

### Article  108  

####Illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances

1.  All States shall co-operate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions.   
2.  Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the co-operation of other States to suppress such traffic.   

### Article  109  

####Unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas

1.  All States shall co-operate in the suppression of unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas.   
2.  For the purposes of this Convention, ”unauthorized broadcasting” means the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations, but excluding the transmission of distress calls.   
3.  Any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting may be prosecuted before the court of: 

(a) the flag State of the ship;  

(b) the State of registry of the installation;  

(c) the State of which the person is a national;  

(d) any State where the transmissions can be received; or  

(e) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference.     
4.  On the high seas, a State having jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 3 may, in conformity with article 110, arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus.   

### Article  110  

####Right of visit

1.  Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than a ship entitled to complete immunity in accordance with articles 95 and 96, is not justified in boarding it unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting that: 

(a) the ship is engaged in piracy;  

(b) the ship is engaged in the slave trade;  

(c) the ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under article 109;  

(d) the ship is without nationality; or  

(e) though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship.     
2.  In the cases provided for in paragraph 1, the warship may proceed to verify the ship's right to fly its flag. To this end, it may send a boat under the command of an officer to the suspected ship. If suspicion remains after the documents have been checked, it may proceed to a further examination on board the ship, which must be carried out with all possible consideration.   
3.  If the suspicions prove to be unfounded, and provided that the ship boarded has not committed any act justifying them, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been sustained.   
4.  These provisions apply *mutatis mutandis* to military aircraft.   
5.  These provisions also apply to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service.   

### Article  111  

####Right of hot pursuit

1.  The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State. Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of the pursuing State, and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted. It is not necessary that, at the time when the foreign ship within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone receives the order to stop, the ship giving the order should likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone. If the foreign ship is within a contiguous zone, as defined in article 33, the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of which the zone was established.   
2.  The right of hot pursuit shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to violations in the exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf, including safety zones around continental shelf installations, of the laws and regulations of the coastal State applicable in accordance with this Convention to the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf, including such safety zones.   
3.  The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.   
4.  Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea, or, as the case may be, within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf. The pursuit may only be commenced after a visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship.   
5.  The right of hot pursuit may be exercised only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect.   
6.  Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft: 

(a) the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply *mutatis mutandis;*  

(b) the aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State, summoned by the aircraft, arrives to take over the pursuit, unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship. It does not suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected offender, if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the aircraft itself or other aircraft or ships which continue the pursuit without interruption.     
7.  The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship, in the course of its voyage, was escorted across a portion of the exclusive economic zone or the high seas, if the circumstances rendered this necessary.   
8.  Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby sustained.   

### Article  112  

####Right to lay submarine cables and pipelines

1.  All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the bed of the high seas beyond the continental shelf.   
2.  Article 79, paragraph 5, applies to such cables and pipelines.   

### Article  113  

####Breaking or injury of a submarine cable or pipeline

Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction of a submarine cable beneath the high seas done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications, and similarly the breaking or injury of a submarine pipeline or high-voltage power cable, shall be a punishable offence. This provision shall apply also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury. However, it shall not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury.  

### Article  114  

####Breaking or injury by owners of a submarine cable or pipeline of another submarine cable or pipeline

Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable or pipeline beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable or pipeline, cause a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, they shall bear the cost of the repairs.  

### Article  115  

####Indemnity for loss incurred in avoiding injury to a submarine cable or pipeline

Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable or pipeline, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.  

### SECTION  2  

####CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE HIGH SEAS

### Article  116  

####Right to fish on the high seas

All States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas subject to: 

(a) their treaty obligations;  

(b) the rights and duties as well as the interests of coastal States provided for, *inter alina*, in article 63, paragraph 2, and articles 64 to 67; and  

(c) the provisions of this section.    

### Article  117  

####Duty of States to adopt with respect to their nationals measures for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas

All States have the duty to take, or to co-operate with other States in taking, such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas.  

### Article  118  

####Co-operation of States in the conservation and management of living resources

States shall co-operate with each other in the conservation and management of living resources in the areas of the high seas. States whose nationals exploit identical living resources, or different living resources in the same area, shall enter into negotiations with a view to taking the measures necessary for the conservation of the living resources concerned. They shall, as appropriate, co-operate to establish subregional or regional fisheries organizations to this end.  

### Article  119  

####Conservation of the living resources of the high seas

1.  In determining the allowable catch and establishing other conservation measures for the living resources in the high seas, States shall: 

(a) take measures which are designed, on the best scientific evidence available to the States concerned, to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;  

(b) take into consideration the effects on species associated with or dependent upon harvested species with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such associated or dependent species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.

1.  

(a) Without prejudice to the objectives set forth in article 150 and for the purpose of implementing subparagraph (h) of that article, the Authority, acting through existing forums or such new arrangements or agreements as may be appropriate, in which all interested parties, including both producers and consumers, participate, shall take measures necessary to promote the growth, efficiency and stability of markets for those commodities produced from the minerals derived from the Area, at prices remunerative to producers and fair to consumers. All States Parties shall co-operate to this end.  

(b) The Authority shall have the right to participate in any commodity conference dealing with those commodities and in which all interested parties including both producers and consumers participate. The Authority shall have the right to become a party to any arrangement or agreement resulting from such conferences. Participation of the Authority in any organs established under those arrangements or agreements shall be in respect of production in the Area and in accordance with the relevant rules of those organs.  

(c) The Authority shall carry out its obligations under the arrangements or agreements referred to in this paragraph in a manner which assures a uniform and non-discriminatory implementation in respect of all production in the Area of the minerals concerned. In doing so, the Authority shall act in a manner consistent with the terms of existing contracts and approved plans of work of the Enterprise.     
2.  

(a) During the interim period specified in paragraph 3, commercial production shall not be undertaken pursuant to an approved plan of work until the operator has applied for and has been issued a production authorization by the Authority. Such production authorizations may not be applied for or issued more than five years prior to the planned commencement of commercial production under the plan of work unless, having regard to the nature and timing of project development, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority prescribe another period.  

(b) In the application for the production authorization, the operator shall specify the annual quantity of nickel expected to be recovered under the approved plan of work. The application shall include a schedule of expenditures to be made by the operator after he has received the authorization which are reasonably calculated to allow him to begin commercial production on the date planned.  

(c) For the purposes of subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Authority shall establish appropriate performance requirements in accordance with Annex III, article 17.  

(d) The Authority shall issue a production authorization for the level of production applied for unless the sum of that level and the levels already authorized exceeds the nickel production ceiling, as calculated pursuant to paragraph 4 in the year of issuance of the authorization, during any year of planned production falling within the interim period.  

(e) When issued, the production authorization and approved application shall become a part of the approved plan of work.  

(f) If the operator's application for a production authorization is denied pursuant to subparagraph (d), the operator may apply again to the Authority at any time.     
3.  The interim period shall begin five years prior to 1 January of the year in which the earliest commercial production is planned to commence under an approved plan of work. If the earliest commercial production is delayed beyond the year originally planned, the beginning of the interim period and the production ceiling originally calculated shall be adjusted accordingly. The interim period shall last 25 years or until the end of the Review Conference referred to in article 155 or until the day when such new arrangements or agreements as are referred to in paragraph 1 enter into force, whichever is earliest. The Authority shall resume the power provided in this article for the remainder of the interim period if the said arrangements or agreements should lapse or become ineffective for any reason whatsoever.   
4.  

(a) The production ceiling for any year of the interim period shall be the sum of: 

(i) the difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production and the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period; and  

(ii) sixty per cent of the difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year for which the production authorization is being applied for and the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production.    

(b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a): 

(i) trend line values used for computing the nickel production ceiling shall be those annual nickel consumption values on a trend line computed during the year in which a production authorization is issued. The trend line shall be derived from a linear regression of the logarithms of actual nickel consumption for the most recent 15-year period for which such data are available, time being the independent variable. This trend line shall be referred to as the original trend line;  

(ii) if the annual rate of increase of the original trend line is less than 3 per cent, then the trend line used to determine the quantities referred to in subparagraph (a) shall instead be one passing through the original trend line at the value for the first year of the relevant 15-year period, and increasing at 3 per cent annually; provided however that the production ceiling established for any year of the interim period may not in any case exceed the difference between the original trend line value for that year and the original trend line value for the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period.       
5.  The Authority shall reserve to the Enterprise for its initial production a quantity of 38,000 metric tonnes of nickel from the available production ceiling calculated pursuant to paragraph 4.   
6.  

(a) An operator may in any year produce less than or up to 8 per cent more than the level of annual production of minerals from polymetallic nodules specified in his production authorization, provided that the over-all amount of production shall not exceed that specified in the authorization. Any excess over 8 per cent and up to 20 per cent in any year, or any excess in the first and subsequent years following two consecutive years in which excesses occur, shall be negotiated with the Authority, which may require the operator to obtain a supplementary production authorization to cover additional production.  

(b) Applications for such supplementary production authorizations shall be considered by the Authority only after all pending applications by operators who have not yet received production authorizations have been acted upon and due account has been taken of other likely applicants. The Authority shall be guided by the principle of not exceeding the total production allowed under the production ceiling in any year of the interim period. It shall not authorize the production under any plan of work of a quantity in excess of 46,500 metric tonnes of nickel per year.     
7.  The levels of production of other metals such as copper, cobalt and manganese extracted from the polymetallic nodules that are recovered pursuant to a production authorization should not be higher than those which would have been produced had the operator produced the maximum level of nickel from those nodules pursuant to this article. The Authority shall establish rules, regulations and procedures pursuant to Annex III, article 17, to implement this paragraph.   
8.  Rights and obligations relating to unfair economic practices under relevant multilateral trade agreements shall apply to the exploration for and exploitation of minerals from the Area. In the settlement of disputes arising under this provision, States Parties which are Parties to such multilateral trade agreements shall have recourse to the dispute settlement procedures of such agreements.   
9.  The Authority shall have the power to limit the level of production of minerals from the Area, other than minerals from polymetallic nodules, under such conditions and applying such methods as may be appropriate by adopting regulations in accordance with article 161, paragraph 8.   
10.  Upon the recommendation of the Council on the basis of advice from the Economic Planning Commission, the Assembly shall establish a system of compensation or take other measures of economic adjustment assistance including co-operation with specialized agencies and other international organizations to assist developing countries which suffer serious adverse effects on their export earnings or economies resulting from a reduction in the price of an affected mineral or in the volume of exports of that mineral, to the extent that such reduction is caused by activities in the Area. The Authority on request shall initiate studies on the problems of those States which are likely to be most seriously affected with a view to minimizing their difficulties and assisting them in their economic adjustment.

2.  Except as provided in paragraph 6, such qualification standards shall relate to the financial and technical capabilities of the applicant and his performance under any previous contracts with the Authority.   
3.  Each applicant shall be sponsored by the State Party of which it is a national unless the applicant has more than one nationality, as in the case of a partnership or consortium of entities from several States, in which event all States Parties involved shall sponsor the application, or unless the applicant is effectively controlled by another State Party or its nationals, in which event both States Parties shall sponsor the application. The criteria and procedures for implementation of the sponsorship requirements shall be set forth in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority,   
4.  The sponsoring State or States shall, pursuant to article 139, have the responsibility to ensure, within their legal systems, that a contractor so sponsored shall carry out activities in the Area in conformity with the terms of its contract and its obligations under this Convention. A sponsoring State shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that State Party has adopted laws and regulations and taken administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction.   
5.  The procedures for assessing the qualifications of States Parties which are applicants shall take into account their character as States.   
6.  The qualification standards shall require that every applicant, without exception, shall as part of his application undertake: 

(a) to accept as enforceable and comply with the applicable obligations created by the provisions of Part XI, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, the decisions of the organs of the Authority and terms of his contracts with the Authority;  

(b) to accept control by the Authority of activities in the Area, as authorized by this Convention;  

(c) to provide the Authority with a written assurance that his obligations under the contract will be fulfilled in good faith;  

(d) to comply with the provisions on the transfer of technology set forth in article 5 of this Annex.     

### Article  5  

####Transfer of technology

1.  When submitting a plan of work, every applicant shall make available to the Authority a general description of the equipment and methods to be used in carrying out activities in the Area, and other relevant non-proprietary information about the characteristics of such technology and information as to where such technology is available.   
2.  Every operator shall inform the Authority of revisions in the description and information made available pursuant to paragraph 1 whenever a substantial technological change or innovation is introduced.   
3.  Every contract for carrying out activities in the Area shall contain the following undertakings by the contractor: 

(a) to make available to the Enterprise on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, whenever the Authority so requests, the technology which he uses in carrying out activities in the Area under the contract, which the contractor is legally entitled to transfer. This shall be done by means of licences or other appropriate arrangements which the contractor shall negotiate with the Enterprise and which shall be set forth in a specific agreement supplementary to the contract. This undertaking may be invoked only if the Enterprise finds that it is unable to obtain the same or equally efficient and useful technology on the open market on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions;  

(b) to obtain a written assurance from the owner of any technology used in carrying out activities in the Area under the contract, which is not generally available on the open market and which is not covered by subparagraph (a), that the owner will, whenever the Authority so requests, make that technology available to the Enterprise under licence or other appropriate arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, to the same extent as made available to the contractor. If this assurance is not obtained, the technology in question shall not be used by the contractor in carrying out activities in the Area;  

(c) to acquire from the owner by means of an enforceable contract, upon the request of the Enterprise and if it is possible to do so without substantial cost to the contractor, the legal right to transfer to the Enterprise any technology used by the contractor, in carrying out activities in the Area under the contract, which the contractor is otherwise not legally entitled to transfer and which is not generally available on the open market. In cases where there is a substantial corporate relationship between the contractor and the owner of the technology, the closeness of this relationship and the degree of control or influence shall be relevant to the determination whether all feasible measures have been taken to acquire such a right. In cases where the contractor exercises effective control over the owner, failure to acquire from the owner the legal right shall be considered relevant to the contractor's qualification for any subsequent application for approval of a plan of work;  

(d) to facilitate, upon the request of the Enterprise, the acquisition by the Enterprise of any technology covered by subparagraph (b), under licence or other appropriate arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, if the Enterprise decides to negotiate directly with the owner of the technology;  

(e) to take the same measures as are prescribed in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) for the benefit of a developing State or group of developing States which has applied for a contract under article 9 of this Annex, provided that these measures shall be limited to the exploitation of the part of the area proposed by the contractor which has been reserved pursuant to article 8 of this Annex and provided that activities under the contract sought by the developing State or group of developing States would not involve transfer of technology to a third State or the nationals of a third State. The obligation under this provision shall only apply with respect to any given contractor where technology has not been requested by the Enterprise or transferred by that contractor to the Enterprise.     
4.  Disputes concerning undertakings required by paragraph 3, like other provisions of the contracts, shall be subject to compulsory settlement in accordance with Part XI and, in cases of violation of these undertakings, suspension or termination of the contract or monetary penalties may be ordered in accordance with article 18 of this Annex. Disputes as to whether offers made by the contractor are within the range of fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions may be submitted by either party to binding commercial arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or such other arbitration rules as may be prescribed in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority. If the finding is that the offer made by the contractor is not within the range of fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions, the contractor shall be given 45 days to revise his offer to bring it within that range before the Authority takes any action in accordance with article 18 of this Annex.   
5.  If the Enterprise is unable to obtain on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions appropriate technology to enable it to commence in a timely manner the recovery and processing of minerals from the Area, either the Council or the Assembly may convene a group of States Parties composed of those which are engaged in activities in the Area, those which have sponsored entities which are engaged in activities in the Area and other States Parties having access to such technology. This group shall consult together and shall take effective measures to ensure that such technology is made available to the Enterprise on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions. Each such State Party shall take all feasible measures to this end within its own legal system.   
6.  In the case of joint ventures with the Enterprise, transfer of technology will be in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement.   
7.  The undertakings required by paragraph 3 shall be included in each contract for the carrying out of activities in the Area until 10 years after the commencement of commercial production by the Enterprise, and may be invoked during that period.   
8.  For the purposes of this article, ”technology” means the specialized equipment and technical know-how, including manuals, designs, operating instructions, training and technical advice and assistance, necessary to assemble, maintain and operate a viable system and the legal right to use these items for that purpose on a non-exclusive basis.   

### Article  6  

####Approval of plans of work

1.  Six months after the entry into force of this Convention, and thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration proposed plans of work.   
2.  When considering an application for approval of a plan of work in the form of a contract, the Authority shall first ascertain whether: 

(a) the applicant has complied with the procedures established for applications in accordance with article 4 of this Annex and has given the Authority the undertakings and assurances required by that article. In cases of non-compliance with these procedures or in the absence of any of these undertakings and assurances, the applicant shall be given 45 days to remedy these defects;  

(b) the applicant possesses the requisite qualifications provided for in article 4 of this Annex.     
3.  All proposed plans of work shall be taken up in the order in which they are received. The proposed plans of work shall comply with and be governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, including those on operational requirements, financial contributions and the undertakings concerning the transfer of technology. If the proposed plans of work conform to these requirements, the Authority shall approve them provided that they are in accordance with the uniform and non-discriminatory requirements set forth in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, unless: 

(a) part or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is included in an approved plan of work or a previously submitted proposed plan of work which has not yet been finally acted on by the Authority;  

(b) part or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is disapproved by the Authority pursuant to article 162, paragraph 2 (x); or  

(c) the proposed plan of work has been submitted or sponsored by a State Party which already holds: 

(i) plans of work for exploration and exploitation of polymetallic nodules in non-reserved areas that, together with either part of the area covered by the application for a plan of work, exceed in size 30 per cent of a circular area of 400,000 square kilometres surrounding the centre of either part of the area covered by the proposed plan of work;  

(ii) plans of work for the exploration and exploitation of polymetallic nodules in non-reserved areas which, taken together, constitute 2 per cent of the total sea-bed area which is not reserved or disapproved for exploitation pursuant to article 162, paragraph (2)(x).       
4.  For the purpose of the standard set forth in paragraph 3(c), a plan of work submitted by a partnership or consortium shall be counted on a *pro rata* basis among the sponsoring States Parties involved in accordance with article 4, paragraph 3, of this Annex. The Authority may approve plans of work covered by paragraph 3(c) if it determines that such approval would not permit a State Party or entities, sponsored by it to monopolize the conduct of activities in the Area or to preclude other States Parties from activities in the Area.   
5.  Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), after the end of the interim period specified in article 151, paragraph 3, the Authority may adopt by means of rules, regulations and procedures other procedures and criteria consistent with this Convention for deciding which applicants shall have plans of work approved in cases of selection among applicants for a proposed area. These procedures and criteria shall ensure approval of plans of work on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis.   

### Article  7  

####Selection among applicants for production authorizations

1.  Six months after the entry into force of this Convention, and thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration applications for production authorizations submitted during the immediately preceding period. The Authority shall issue the authorizations applied for if all such applications can be approved without exceeding the production limitation or contravening the obligations of the Authority under a commodity agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as provided in article 151.   
2.  When a selection must be made among applicants for production authorizations because of the production limitation set forth in article 151, paragraphs 2 to 7, or because of the obligations of the Authority under a commodity agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as provided for in article 151, paragraph 1, the Authority shall make the selection on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory standards set forth in its rules, regulations and procedures.   
3.  In the application of paragraph 2, the Authority shall give priority to those applicants which: 

(a) give better assurance of performance, taking into account their financial and technical qualifications and their performance, if any, under previously approved plans of work;  

(b) provide earlier prospective financial benefits to the Authority, taking into account when commercial production is scheduled to begin;  

(c) have already invested the most resources and effort in prospecting or exploration.     
4.  Applicants which are not selected in any period shall have priority in subsequent periods until they receive a production authorization.   
5.  Selection shall be made taking into account the need to enhance opportunities for all States Parties, irrespective of their social and economic systems or geographical locations so as to avoid discrimination against any State or system, to participate in activities in the Area and to prevent monopolization of those activities.   
6.  Whenever fewer reserved areas than non-reserved areas are under exploitation, applications for production authorizations with respect to reserved areas shall have priority.   
7.  The decisions referred to in this article shall be taken as soon as possible after the close of each period.   

### Article  8  

####Reservation of areas

Each application, other than those submitted by the Enterprise or by any other entities for reserved areas, shall cover a total area, which need not be a single continuous area, sufficiently large and of sufficien testimated commercial value to allow two mining operations. The applicant shall indicate the co-ordinates dividing the area into two parts of equal estimated commercial value and submit all the data obtained by him with respect to both parts. Without prejudice to the powers of the Authority pursuant to article 17 of this Annex, the data to be submitted concerning polymetallic nodules shall relate to mapping, sampling, the abundance of nodules, and their metal content. Within 45 days of receiving such data, the Authority shall designate which part is to be reserved solely for the conduct of activities by the Authority through the Enterprise or in association with developing States. This designation may be deferred for a further period of 45 days if the Authority requests an independent expert to assess whether all data required by this article has been submitted. The area designated shall become a reserved area as soon as the plan of work for the non-reserved area is approved and the contract is signed.  

### Article  9  

####Activities in reserved areas

1.  The Enterprise shall be given an opportunity to decide whether it intends to carry out activities in each reserved area. This decision may be taken at any time, unless a notification pursuant to paragraph 4 is received by the Authority, in which event the Enterprise shall take its decision within a reasonable time. The Enterprise may decide to exploit such areas in joint ventures with the interested State or entity.   
2.  The Enterprise may conclude contracts for the execution of part of its activities in accordance with Annex IV, article 12. It may also enter into joint ventures for the conduct of such activities with any entities which are eligible to carry out activities in the Area pursuant to article153, paragraph 2(b). When considering such joint ventures, the Enterprise shall offer to States Parties which are developing States and their nationals the opportunity of effective participation.   
3.  The Authority may prescribe, in its rules, regulations and procedures substantive and procedural requirements and conditions with respect to such contracts and joint ventures.   
4.  Any State Party which is a developing State or any natural or juridical person sponsored by it and effectively controlled by it or by other developing State which is a qualified applicant, or any group of the foregoing, may notify the Authority that it wishes to submit a plan of work pursuant to article 6 of this Annex with respect to a reserved area. The plan of work shall be considered if the Enterprise decides, pursuant to paragraph 1, that it does not intend to carry out activities in that area.   

### Article  10  

####Preference and priority among applicants

An operator who has an approved plan of work for exploration only, as provided in article 3, paragraph 4(c), of this Annex shall have a preference and a priority among applicants for a plan of work covering exploitation of the same area and resources. However, such preference or priority may be withdrawn if the operator's performance has not been satisfactory.  

### Article  11  

####Joint arrangements

1.  Contracts may provide for joint arrangements between the contractor and the Authority through the Enterprise, in the form of joint ventures or production sharing, as well as any other form of joint arrangement, which shall have the same protection against revision, suspension or termination as contracts with the Authority.   
2.  Contractors entering into such joint arrangements with the Enterprise may receive financial incentives as provided for in article 13 of this Annex.   
3.  Partners in joint ventures with the Enterprise shall be liable for the payments required by article 13 of this Annex to the extent of their share in the joint ventures, subject to financial incentives as provided for in that article.   

### Article  12  

####Activities carried out by the Enterprise

1.  Activities in the Area carried out by the Enterprise pursuant to article 153, paragraph 2(a), shall be governed by Part XI, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority and its relevant decisions.   
2.  Any plan of work submitted by the Enterprise shall be accompanied by evidence supporting its financial and technical capabilities.   

### Article  13  

####Financial terms of contracts

1.  In adopting rules, regulations and procedures concerning the financial terms of a contract between the Authority and the entities referred to in article 153, paragraph 2(b), and in negotiating those financial terms in accordance with Part XI and those rules, regulations and procedures, the Authority shall be guided by the following objectives: 

(a) to ensure optimum revenues for the Authority from the proceeds of commercial production;  

(b) to attract investments and technology to the exploration and exploitation of the Area;  

(c) to ensure equality of financial treatment and comparable financial obligations for contractors;  

(d) to provide incentives on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis for contractors to undertake joint arrangements with the Enterprise and developing States or their nationals, to stimulate the transfer of technology thereto, and to train the personnel of the Authority and of developing States;  

(e) to enable the Enterprise to engage in sea-bed mining effectively at the same time as the entities referred to in article 153, paragraph 2(b); and  

(f) to ensure that, as a result of the financial incentives provided to contractors under paragraph 14, under the terms of contracts reviewed in accordance with article 19 of this Annex or under the provisions of article 11 of this Annex with respect to joint ventures, contractors are not subsidized so as to be given an artificial competitive advantage with respect to land-based miners.     
2.  A fee shall be levied for the administrative cost of processing an application for approval of a plan of work in the form of a contract and shall be fixed at an amount of $ US 500,000 per application. The amount of the fee shall be reviewed from time to time by the Council in order to ensure that it covers the administrative cost incurred. If such administrative cost incurred by the Authority in processing an application is less than the fixed amount, the Authority shall refund the difference to the applicant.   
3.  A contractor shall pay an annual fixed fee of $ US 1 million from the date of entry into force of the contract. If the approved date of commencement of commercial production is postponed because of a delay in issuing the production authorization, in accordance with article 151, the annual fixed fee shall be waived for the period of postponement. From the date of commencement of commercial production, the contractor shall pay either the production charge or the annual fixed fee, whichever is greater.   
4.  Within a year of the date of commencement of commercial production, in conformity with paragraph 3, a contractor shall choose to make his financial contribution to the Authority by either: 

(a) paying a production charge only; or  

(b) paying a combination of a production charge and a share of net proceeds.     
5.  

(a) If a contractor chooses to make his financial contribution to the Authority by paying a production charge only, it shall be fixed at a percentage of the market value of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract. This percentage shall be fixed as follows:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| (i) years 1-10 of commercial production  | 5 per cent  |
| (ii) years 11 to the end of commercial production  | 12 per cent  |

(b) The said market value shall be the product of the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules extracted from the area covered by the contract and the average price for those metals during the relevant accounting year, as defined in paragraphs 7 and 8.     
6.  If a contractor chooses to make his financial contribution to the Authority by paying a combination of a production charge and a share of net proceeds, such payments shall be determined as follows: 

(a) The production charge shall be fixed at a percentage of the market value, determined in accordance with subparagraph (b), of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract. This percentage shall be fixed as follows:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| (i) first period of commercial production  | 2 per cent  |
| (ii) second period of commercial production  | 4 per cent  |

If, in the seccond period of commercial production, as defined in subparagraph (d), the return on investment in any accounting year as defined in subparagraph (m) falls below 15 per cent as a result of the payment of the production charge at 4 per cent, the production charge shall be 2 per cent instead of 4 per cent in that accounting year.  

(b) The said market value shall be the product of the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract and the average price for those metals during the relevant accounting year as defined in paragraphs 7 and 8.  

(c) 

(i) The Authority's share of net proceeds shall be taken out of that portion of the contractor's net proceeds which is attributable to the mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract, referred to hereinafter as attributable net proceeds.  

(ii) The Authority's share of attributable net proceeds shall be determined in accordance with the following incremental schedule:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Portion of attributable net proceeds  | Share of the Authority  |
| --- | First period of commercial production  | Second period of commercial production  |
| That portion representing a return on investment which is greater than 0 per cent, but less than 10 per cent  | 35 per cent  | 40 per cent  |
| That portion representing a return on investment which is 10 per cent or greater, but less than 20 per cent  | 42.5 per cent  | 50 per cent  |
| That portion representing a return on investment which is 20 per cent or greater  | 50 per cent  | 70 per cent  |

(d) 

(i) The first period of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (c) shall commence in the first accounting year of commercial production and terminate in the accounting year in which the contractor's development costs with interest on the unrecovered portion thereof are fully recovered by his cash surplus, as follows: In the first accounting year during which development costs are incurred, unrecovered development costs shall equal the development costs less cash surplus in that year. In each subsequent accounting year, unrecovered development costs shall equal the unrecovered development costs at the end of the preceding accounting year, plus interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, plus development costs incurred in the current accounting year and less contractor's cash surplus in the current accounting year. The accounting year in which unrecovered development costs become zero for the first time shall be the accounting year in which the contractor's development costs with interest on the unrecovered portion thereof are fully recovered by his cash surplus. The contractor's cash surplus in any accounting year shall be his gross proceeds less his operating costs and less his payments to the Authority under subparagraph (c).  

(ii) The second period of commercial production shall commence in the accounting year following the termination of the first period of commercial production and shall continue until the end of the contract.    

(e) ”Attributable net proceeds” means the product of the contractor's net proceeds and the ratio of the development costs in the mining sector to the contractor's development costs. If the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules and production primarily of three processed metals, namely, cobalt, copper and nickel, the amount of attributable net proceeds shall not be less than 25 per cent of the contractor's net proceeds. Subject to subparagraph (n), in all other cases, including those where the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules, and production primarily of four processed metals, namely, cobalt, copper, manganese and nickel, the Authority may, in its rules, regulations and procedures, prescribe appropriate floors which shall bear the same relationship to each case as the 25 per cent floor does to the three-metal case.  

(f) ”Contractor's net proceeds” means the contractor's gross proceeds less his operating costs and less the recovery of his development costs as set out in subparagraph (j).  

(g) 

(i) If the contractor engages in mining, transporting polymetallic nodules and production of processed metals, ”contractor's gross proceeds” means the gross revenues from the sale of the processed metals and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.  

(ii) In all cases other than those specified in subparagraphs (g)(i) and (n)(iii), ”contractor's gross proceeds” means the gross revenues from the sale of the semi-processed metals from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract, and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority.    

(h) ”Contractor's development costs” means: 

(i) all expenditures incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production which are directly related to the development of the productive capacity of the area covered by the contract and the activities related thereto for operations under the contract in all cases other than that specified in subparagraph (n), in conformity with generally recognized accounting principles, including, *inter alia*, costs of machinery, equipment, ships, processing plant, construction, buildings, land, roads, prospecting and exploration of the area covered by the contract, research and development, interest, required leases, licences and fees; and  

(ii) expenditures similar to those set forth in (i) above incurred subsequent to the commencement of commercial production and necessary to carry out the plan of work, except those chargeable to operating costs.    

(i) The proceeds from the disposal of capital assets and the market value of those capital assets which are no longer required for operations under the contract and which are not sold shall be deducted from the contractor's development costs during the relevant accounting year. When these deductions exceed the contractor's development costs the excess shall be added to the contractor's gross proceeds.  

(j) The contractor's development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (h)(i) and (n)(iv) shall be recovered in 10 equal annual instalments from the date of commencement of commercial production. The contractor's development costs incurred subsequent to the commencement of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (h)(ii) and (n)(iv) shall be recovered in 10 or fewer equal annual instalments so as to ensure their complete recovery by the end of the contract.  

(k) ”Contractor's operating costs” means all expenditures incurred after the commencement of commercial production in the operation of the productive capacity of the area covered by the contract and the activities related thereto for operations under the contract, in conformity with generally recognized accounting principles, including, *inter alia*, the annual fixed fee or the production charge, whichever is greater, expenditures for wages, salaries, employee benefits, materials, services, transporting, processing and marketing costs, interest, utilities, preservation of the marine environment, overhead and administrative costs specifically related to operations under the contract, and any net operating losses carried forward or backward as specified herein. Net operating losses may be carried forward for two consecutive years except in the last two years of the contract in which case they may be carried backward to the two preceding years.  

(l) If the contractor engages in mining, transporting of polymetallic nodules, and production of processed and semi-processed metals, ”development costs of the mining sector” means the portion of the contractor's development costs which is directly related to the mining of the resources of the area covered by the contract, in conformity with generally recognized accounting principles, and the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, including, *inter alia*, application fee, annual fixed fee and, where applicable, costs of prospecting and exploration of the area covered by the contract, and a portion of research and development costs.  

(m) ”Return on investment” in any accounting year means the ratio of attributable net proceeds in that year to the development costs of the mining sector. For the purpose of computing this ratio the development costs of the mining sector shall include expenditures on new or replacement equipment in the mining sector less the original cost of the equipment replaced.  

(n) If the contractor engages in mining only: 

(i) ”attributable net proceeds” means the whole of the contractor's net proceeds;  

(ii) ”contractor's net proceeds” shall be as defined in subparagraph (f);  

(iii) ”contractor's gross proceeds” means the gross revenues from the sale of the polymetallic nodules, and any other monies deemed reasonably attributable to operations under the contract in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority;

(vi) ”return on investment” in any accounting year means the ratio of the contractor's net proceeds in that year to the contractor's development costs. For the purpose of computing this ratio, the contractor's development costs shall include expenditures on new or replacement equipment less the original cost of the equipment replaced.    

(o) The costs referred to in subparagraphs (h), (k), (1) and (n) in respect of interest paid by the contractor shall be allowed to the extent that, in all the circumstances, the Authority approves, pursuant to article 4, paragraph 1, of this Annex, the debt-equity ratio and the rates of interest as reasonable, having regard to existing commercial practice.  

(p) The costs referred to in this paragraph shall not be interpreted as including payments of corporate income taxes or similar charges levied by States in respect of the operations of the contractor.     
7.  

(a) ”Processed metals”, referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6, means the metals in the most basic form in which they are customarily traded on international terminal markets. For this purpose, the Authority shall specify, in its financial rules, regulations and procedures, the relevant international terminal market. For the metals which are not traded on such markets, ”processed metals” means the metals in the most basic form in which they are customarily traded in representative arm's length transactions.  

(b) If the Authority cannot otherwise determine the quantity of the processed metals produced from the polymetallic nodules recovered from the area covered by the contract referred to in paragraphs 5 (b) and 6 (b), the quantity shall be determined on the basis of the metal content of the nodules, processing recovery efficiency and other relevant factors, in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority and in conformity with generally recognized accounting principles.     
8.  If an international terminal market provides a representative pricing mechanism for processed metals, polymetallic nodules and semi-processed metals from the nodules, the average price on that market shall be used. In all other cases, the Authority shall, after consulting the contractor, determine a fair price for the said products in accordance with paragraph 9.   
9.  

(a) All costs, expenditures, proceeds and revenues and all determinations of price and value referred to in this article shall be the result of free market or arm's length transactions. In the absence thereof, they shall be determined by the Authority, after consulting the contractor, as though they were the result of free market or arm's length transactions, taking into account relevant transactions in other markets.  

(b) In order to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the provisions of this paragraph, the Authority shall be guided by the principles adopted for, and the interpretation given to, arm's length transactions by the Commission on Transnational Corporations of the United Nations, the Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developing and Developed Countries and other international organizations, and shall, in its rules, regulations and procedures, specify uniform and internationally acceptable accounting rules and procedures, and the means of selection by the contractor of certified independent accountants acceptable to the Authority for the purpose of carrying out auditing in compliance with those rules, regulations and procedures.     
10.  The contractor shall make available to the accountants, in accordance with the financial rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, such financial data as are required to determine compliance with this article.

2.  Transferred data in respect of the area covered by the plan of work, deemed proprietary, may only be used for the purposes set forth in this article. Data necessary for the formulation by the Authority of rules, regulations and procedures concerning protection of the marine environment and safety, other than equipment design data, shall not be deemed proprietary.   
3.  Data transferred to the Authority by prospectors, applicants for contracts or contractors, deemed proprietary, shall not be disclosed by the Authority to the Enterprise or to anyone external to the Authority, but data on the reserved areas may be disclosed to the Enterprise. Such data transferred by such persons to the Enterprise shall not be disclosed by the Enterprise to the Authority or to anyone external to the Authority.   

### Article  15  

####Training programmes

The contractor shall draw up practical programmes for the training of personnel of the Authority and developing States, including the participation of such personnel in all activities in the Area which are covered by the contract, in accordance with article 144, paragraph 2.  

### Article  16  

####Exclusive right to explore and exploit

The Authority shall, pursuant to Part XI and its rules, regulations and procedures, accord the operator the exclusive right to explore and exploit the area covered by the plan of work in respect of a specified category of resources and shall ensure that no other entity operates in the same area for a different category of resources in a manner which might interfere with the operations of the operator. The operator shall have security of tenure in accordance with article 153, paragraph 6.  

### Article  17  

####Rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority

1.  The Authority shall adopt and uniformly apply rules, regulations and procedures in accordance with article 160, paragraph 2(f)(ii), and article 162, paragraph 2(o)(ii), for the exercise of its functions as set forth in Part XI on, *inter alia*, the following matters: 

(a) administrative procedures relating to prospecting, exploration and exploitation in the Area;  

(b) operations: 

(i) size of area;  

(ii) duration of operations;  

(iii) performance requirements including assurances pursuant to article 4, paragraph 6(c), of this Annex;  

(iv) categories of resources;  

(v) renunciation of areas;  

(vi) progress reports;  

(vii) submission of data;  

(viii) inspection and supervision of operations;  

(ix) prevention of interference with other activities in the marine environment;  

(x) transfer of rights and obligations by a contractor;  

(xi) procedures for transfer of technology to developing States in accordance with article 144 and for their direct participation;  

(xii) mining standards and practices, including those relating to operational safety, conservation of the resources and the protection of the marine environment;  

(xiii) definition of commercial production;  

(xiv) qualification standards for applicants;    

(c) financial matters: 

(i) establishment of uniform and non-discriminatory costing and accounting rules and the method of selection of auditors;  

(ii) apportionment of proceeds of operations;  

(iii) the incentives referred to in article 13 of this Annex;    

(d) implementation of decisions taken pursuant to article 151, paragraph 10, and article 164, paragraph 2(d).     
2.  Rules, regulations and procedures on the following items shall fully reflect the objective criteria set out below: 

(a) Size of areas: The Authority shall determine the appropriate size of areas for exploration which may be up to twice as large as those for exploitation in order to permit intensive exploration operations. The size of area shall be calculated to satisfy the requirements of article 8 of this Annex on reservation of areas as well as stated production requirements consistent with article 151 in accordance with the terms of the contract taking into account the state of the art of technology then available for sea-bed mining and the relevant physical characteristics of the areas. Areas shall be neither smaller nor larger than are necessary to satisfy this objective.  

(b) Duration of operations: 

(i) Prospecting shall be without time-limit;  

(ii) Exploration should be of sufficient duration to permit a thorough survey of the specific area, the design and construction of mining equipment for the area and the design and construction of small and medium-size processing plants for the purpose of testing mining and processing systems;  

(iii) The duration of exploitation should be related to the economic life of the mining project, taking into consideration such factors as the depletion of the ore, the useful life of mining equipment and processing facilities and commercial viability. Exploitation should be of sufficient duration to permit commercial extraction of minerals of the area and should include a reasonable time period for construction of commercial-scale mining and processing systems, during which period commercial production should not be required. The total duration of exploitation, however, should also be short enough to give the Authority an opportunity to amend the terms and conditions of the plan of work at the time it considers renewal in accordance with rules, regulations and procedures which it has adopted subsequent to approving the plan of work.    

(c) Performance requirements: The Authority shall require that during the exploration stage periodic expenditures be made by the operator which are reasonably related to the size of the area covered by the plan of work and the expenditures which would be expected of a *bona fide* operator who intended to bring the area into commercial production within the time-limits established by the Authority. The required expenditures should not be established at a level which would discourage prospective operators with less costly technology than is prevalently in use. The Authority shall establish a maximum time interval, after the exploration stage is completed and the exploitation stage begins, to achieve commercial production. To determine this interval, the Authority should take into consideration that construction of large-scale mining and processing systems cannot be initiated until after the termination of the exploration stage and the commencement of the exploitation stage. Accordingly, the interval to bring an area into commercial production should take into account the time necessary for this construction after the completion of the exploration stage and reasonable allowance should be made for unavoidable delays in the construction schedule. Once commercial production is achieved, the Authority shall within reasonable limits and taking into consideration all relevant factors require the operator to maintain commercial production throughout the period of the plan of work.  

(d) Categories of resources: In determining the category of resources in respect of which a plan of work may be approved, the Authority shall give emphasis *inter alia* to the following characteristics: 

(i) that certain resources require the use of similar mining methods; and  

(ii) that some resources can be developed simultaneously without undue interference between operators developing different resources in the same area.   Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Authority from approving a plan of work with respect to more than one category of resources in the same area to the same applicant.  

(e) Renunciation of areas: The operator shall have the right at any time to renounce without penalty the whole or part of his rights in the area covered by a plan of work.  

(f) protection of the marine environment: Rules, regulations and procedures shall be drawn up in order to secure effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects directly resulting from activities in the Area or from shipboard processing immediately above a mine site of minerals derived from that mine site, taking into account the extent to which such harmful effects may directly result from drilling, dredging, coring and excavation and from disposal, dumping and discharge into the marine environment of sediment, wastes or other effluents.  

(g) Commercial production: Commercial production shall be deemed to have begun if an operator engages in sustained large-scale recovery operations which yield a quantity of materials sufficient to indicate clearly that the principal purpose is large-scale production rather than production intended for information gathering, analysis or the testing of equipment or plant.     

### Article  18  

####Penalties

1.  A contractor's rights under the contract may be suspended or terminated only in the following cases; 

(a) if, in spite of warnings by the Authority, the contractor has conducted his activities in such a way as to result in serious, persistent and wilful violations of the fundamental terms of the contract, Part XI and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority; or  

(b) if the contractor has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to him.     
2.  In the case of any violation of the contract not covered by paragraph l(a), or in lieu of suspension or termination under paragraph l(a), the Authority may impose upon the contractor monetary penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.   
3.

### Article  19

2.  Any contract entered into in accordance with article 153, paragraph 3, may be revised only with the consent of the parties.   

### Article  20  

####Transfer of rights and obligations

The rights and obligations arising under a contract may be transferred only with the consent of the Authority, and in accordance with its rules, regulations and procedures. The Authority shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the transfer if the proposed transferee is in all respects a qualified applicant and assumes all of the obligations of the transferor and if the transfer does not confer to the transferee a plan of work, the approval of which would be forbidden by article 6, paragraph 3(c), of this Annex.  

### Article  21  

####Applicable law

1.  The contract shall be governed by the terms of the contract, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, Part XI and other rules of international law not incompatible with this Convention.   
2.  Any final decision rendered by a court or tribunal having jurisdiction under this Convention relating to the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the contractor shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.   
3.  No State Party may impose conditions on a contractor that are inconsistent with Part XI. However, the application by a State Party to contractors sponsored by it, or to ships flying its flag, of environmental or other laws and regulations more stringent than those in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority adopted pursuant to article 17, paragraph 2(f), of this Annex shall not be deemed inconsistent with Part XI.   

### Article  22  

####Responsibility

The contractor shall have responsibility or liability for any damage arising out of wrongful acts in the conduct of its operations, account being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the Authority. Similarly, the Authority shall have responsibility or liability for any damage arising out of wrongful acts in the exercise of its powers and functions, including violations under article 168, paragraph 2, account being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the contractor.

### 7  

(a) Every applicant for registration as a pioneer investor shall pay to the Commission a fee of $US 250,000. When the pioneer investor applies to the Authority for a plan of work for exploration and exploitation the fee referred to in Annex III, article 13, paragraph 2, of the Convention shall be $US 250,000.  

(b) Every registered pioneer investor shall pay an annual fixed fee of $US 1 million commencing from the date of the allocation of the pioneer area. The payments shall be made by the pioneer investor to the Authority upon the approval of its plan of work for exploration and exploitation. The financial arrangements undertaken pursuant to such plan of work shall be adjusted to take account of the payments made pursuant to this paragraph.  

(c) Every registered pioneer investor shall agree to incur periodic expenditures, with respect to the pioneer area allocated to it, until approval of its plan of work pursuant to paragraph 8, of an amount to be determined by the Commission. The amount should be reasonably related to the size of the pioneer area and the expenditures which would be expected of a *bona fide* operator who intends to bring that area into commercial production within a reasonable time.    

### 8  

(a) Within six months of the entry into force of the Convention and certification by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 11, of compliance with this resolution, the pioneer investor so registered shall apply to the Authority for approval of a plan of work for exploration and exploitation, in accordance with the Convention. The plan of work in respect of such application shall comply with and be governed by the relevant provisions of the Convention and the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, including those on the operational requirements, the financial requirements and the undertakings concerning the transfer of technology. Accordingly, the Authority shall approve such application.  

(b) When an application for approval of a plan of work is submitted by an entity other than a State, pursuant to subparagraph (a), the certifying State or States shall be deemed to be the sponsoring State for the purposes of Annex III, article 4, of the Convention, and shall thereupon assume such obligations.  

(c) No plan of work for exploration and exploitation shall be approved unless the certifying State is a Party to the Convention. In the case of the entities referred to in paragraph 1 (a) (ii), the plan of work for exploration and exploitation shall not be approved unless all the States whose natural or juridical persons comprise those entities are Parties to the Convention. If any such State fails to ratify the Convention within six months after it has received a notification from the Authority that an application by it, or sponsored by it, is pending, its status as a pioneer investor or certifying State, as the case may be, shall terminate, unless the Council, by a majority of three fourths of its members present and voting, decides to postpone the terminal date for a period not exceeding six months.    

### 9  

(a) In the allocation of production authorizations, in accordance with article 151 and Annex III, article 7, of the Convention, the pioneer investors who have obtained approval of plans of work for exploration and exploitation shall have priority over all applicants other than the Enterprise which shall be entitled to production authorizations for two mine sites including that referred to in article 151, paragraph 5, of the Convention. After each of the pioneer investors has obtained production authorization for its first mine site, the priority for the Enterprise contained in Annex III, article 7, paragraph 6, of the Convention shall apply.  

(b) Production authorizations shall be issued to each pioneer investor within 30 days of the date on which that pioneer investor notifies the Authority that it will commence commercial production within five years. If a pioneer investor is unable to begin production within the period of five years for reasons beyond its control, it shall apply to the Legal and Technical Commission for an extension of time. That Commission shall grant the extension of time, for a period not exceeding five years and not subject to further extension, if it is satisfied that the pioneer investor cannot begin on an economically viable basis at the time originally planned. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent the Enterprise or any other pioneer applicant, who has notified the Authority that it will commence commercial production within five years, from being given a priority over any applicant who has obtained an extension of time under this subparagraph.  

(c) If the Authority, upon being given notice, pursuant to subparagraph (b), determines that the commencement of commercial production within five years would exceed the production ceiling in article 151, paragraphs 2 to 7, of the Convention, the applicant shall hold a priority over any other applicant for the award of the next production authorization allowed by the production ceiling.  

(d) If two or more pioneer investors apply for production authorizations to begin commercial production at. the same time and article 151, paragraphs 2 to 7, of the Convention, would not permit all such production to commence simultaneously, the Authority shall notify the pioneer investors concerned. Within three months of such notification, they shall decide whether and, if so, to what extent they wish to apportion the allowable tonnage among themselves.  

(e) If, pursuant to subparagraph (d), the pioneer investors concerned decide not to apportion the available production among themselves they shall agree on an order of priority for production authorizations and all subsequent applications for production authorizations will be granted after those referred to in this subparagraph have been approved.  

(f) If, pursuant to subparagraph (d), the pioneer investors concerned decide to apportion the available production among themselves, the Authority shall award each of them a production authorization for such lesser quantity as they have agreed. In each case the stated production requirements of the applicant will be approved and their full production will be allowed as soon as the production ceiling admits of additional capacity sufficient for the applicants involved in the competition. All subsequent applications for production authorizations will only be granted after the requirements of this subparagraph have been met and the applicant is no longer subject to the reduction of production provided for in this subparagraph.  

(g) If the parties fail to reach agreement within the stated time period, the matter shall be decided immediately by the means provided for in paragraph 5 (c) in accordance with the criteria set forth in Annex III, article 7, paragraphs 3 and 5, of the Convention.    

### 10  

(a) Any rights acquired by entities or natural or juridical persons which possess the nationality of or are effectively controlled by a State or States whose status as certifying State has been terminated, shall lapse unless the pioneer investor changes its nationality and sponsorship within six months of the date of such termination, as provided for in subparagraph (c).  

(b) A pioneer investor may change its nationality and sponsorship from that existing at the time of its registration as a pioneer investor to that of any State Party to the Convention which has effective control over the pioneer investor in terms of paragraph 1 (a).  

(c) Changes of nationality and sponsorship pursuant to this paragraph shall not affect any right or priority conferred on a pioneer investor pursuant to paragraphs 6 and 8.    

### 11  

The Commission shall: 

(a) provide each pioneer investor with the certificate of compliance with the provisions of this resolution referred to in paragraph 8; and  

(b) include in its final report required by paragraph 11 of resolution I of the Conference details of all registrations of pioneer investors and allocations of pioneer areas pursuant to this resolution.    

### 12  

In order to ensure that the Enterprise is able to carry out activities in the Area in such a manner as to keep pace with States and other entities: 

(a) every registered pioneer investor shall: 

(i) carry out exploration, at the request of the Commission, in the area reserved, pursuant to paragraph 3 in connection with its application, for activities in the Area by the Authority through the Enterprise or in association with developing States, on the basis that the costs so incurred plus interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum shall be reimbursed;

### DEEL  II  

####TERRITORIALE ZEE EN AANSLUITENDE ZONE

### AFDELING  1  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  2  

####Juridische status van de territoriale zee, van het luchtruim boven de territoriale zee en van de bodem en ondergrond van die zee

1.  De soevereiniteit van een kuststaat strekt zich buiten zijn landgebied en zijn binnenwateren en, in het geval van een archipelstaat, zijn archipelwateren, uit over een aangrenzende zeestrook, omschreven als de territoriale zee.   
2.  Deze soevereiniteit strekt zich uit over het luchtruim boven de territoriale zee en over de bodem en ondergrond van die zee.   
3.  De soevereiniteit over de territoriale zee wordt uitgeoefend met inachtneming van dit Verdrag en van andere regels van het internationale recht.   

### AFDELING  2  

####BEGRENZING VAN DE TERRITORIALE ZEE

### Artikel  3  

####Breedte van de territoriale zee

Iedere Staat heeft het recht de breedte van zijn territoriale zee vast te stellen tot een grens niet verder dan 12 zeemijl gemeten van de basislijnen bepaald overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  4  

####Buitengrens van de territoriale zee

De buitengrens van de territoriale zee wordt aangegeven door de lijn waarvan elk punt op een afstand gelijk aan de breedte van de territoriale zee is gelegen van het dichtstbijgelegen punt van de basislijn.  

### Artikel  5  

####Normale basislijn

Behalve wanneer in dit Verdrag anders bepaald, is de normale basislijn vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten de laagwaterlijn langs de kust, zoals die is aangegeven op officieel door de kuststaat erkende, op grote schaal uitgevoerde zeekaarten.  

### Artikel  6  

####Riffen

In het geval van op atollen gelegen eilanden of van eilanden omgeven met franjeriffen, is de basislijn voor het meten van de breedte van de territoriale zee de laagwaterlijn aan de zeezijde van het rif zoals aangegeven met het desbetreffende teken op officieel door de kuststaat erkende kaarten.  

### Artikel  7  

####Rechte basislijnen

1.  Op plaatsen waar de kustlijn diepe uithollingen en insnijdingen vertoont, of indien er een eilandenreeks langs en in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van de kust ligt, kan de methode van rechte basislijnen die daarvoor in aanmerking komende punten verbinden, worden toegepast voor het vaststellen van de basislijn vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten.   
2.  Waar wegens de aanwezigheid van een delta en andere natuurlijke omstandigheden de kustlijn aan voortdurende veranderingen onderhevig is, kunnen de passende punten worden gekozen langs de uiterste grens waar de laagwaterlijn reikt en, niettegenstaande de daaropvolgende terugtrekking van de laagwaterlijn, blijven de rechte basislijnen van kracht totdat zij door de kuststaat worden gewijzigd overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.   
3.  Aldus getrokken rechte basislijnen mogen niet aanmerkelijk afwijken van de algemene richting van de kust en de binnen die lijnen gelegen zeegebieden moeten voldoende nauw met het landgebied verbonden zijn om onderworpen te zijn aan het regime der binnenwateren.   
4.  Er mogen geen rechte basislijnen worden getrokken van en naar bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffingen, tenzij er vuurtorens of soortgelijke installaties die duurzaam boven zee uitsteken op gebouwd zijn of behalve in gevallen waarin het trekken van basislijnen naar en van zulke verheffingen algemeen internationaal erkend is.   
5.  In de gevallen waarin overeenkomstig het eerste lid de methode van de rechte basislijnen kan worden toegepast, kan bij het vaststellen van bepaalde basislijnen rekening worden gehouden met bijzondere economische belangen van de betrokken streek, waarvan het bestaan en het gewicht duidelijk uit langdurig gebruik blijken.   
6.  De methode van rechte basislijnen mag niet door een Staat op zodanige wijze worden toegepast, dat daardoor de territoriale zee van een andere Staat zou worden afgesneden van de volle zee of een exclusieve economische zone.   

### Artikel  8  

####Binnenwateren

1.  Behalve zoals bepaald in Deel IV maken wateren gelegen aan de landzijde van de basislijn van de territoriale zee deel uit van de binnenwateren van de Staat.   
2.  Wanneer het vaststellen van een rechte basislijn overeenkomstig de methode vervat in artikel 7 tot gevolg heeft, dat wateren die vroeger niet als zodanig werden beschouwd, als binnenwateren worden ingesloten, bestaat in die wateren het in dit Verdrag omschreven recht van onschuldige doorvaart.   

### Artikel  9  

####Riviermondingen

Indien een rivier rechtstreeks uitstroomt in de zee, is de basislijn een rechte lijn dwars over de riviermonding tussen punten op de laagwaterlijn van haar oevers.  

### Artikel  10  

####Baaien

1.  Dit artikel heeft uitsluitend betrekking op baaien waaraan een enkele Staat ligt.   
2.  In dit Verdrag wordt onder een baai verstaan een duidelijke insnijding van de kust waarvan de diepte landinwaarts in een zodanige verhouding staat tot de breedte van de monding dat er een door land ingesloten watervlakte ontstaat, en die meer is dan een kromming van de kustlijn. Een insnijding wordt echter niet als een baai beschouwd indien de oppervlakte ervan niet even groot is als of groter dan de halve cirkel waarvan de middellijn wordt gevormd door de lijn die over de monding van de insnijding wordt getrokken.   
3.  Voor het meten wordt als oppervlakte van een insnijding gerekend het gebied gelegen tussen de laagwaterlijn rond de kust van de insnijding en een lijn getrokken tussen de natuurlijke toegangspunten bij laag water. Indien een insnijding door de aanwezigheid van eilanden meer dan één monding heeft, wordt de halve cirkel getrokken op een lijn ter lengte van de totale lengte van de lijnen over de verschillende mondingen. Eilanden die binnen een insnijding zijn gelegen, worden meegerekend alsof zij deel uitmaakten van de wateroppervlakte van de insnijding.   
4.  Indien de afstand tussen de natuurlijke toegangspunten van een baai bij laag water niet groter is dan vierentwintig zeemijl, kan tussen deze twee punten een afsluitingslijn worden getrokken, waarbij de aldus ingesloten wateroppervlakte zal worden beschouwd als tot de binnenwateren te behoren.   
5.  Indien de afstand tussen de natuurlijke toegangspunten van een baai bij laag water groter is dan vierentwintig zeemijl, wordt een rechte basislijn ter lengte van vierentwintig zeemijl getrokken binnen de baai en wel op zodanige wijze dat daardoor de grootste wateroppervlakte die met een lijn van die lengte kan worden begrensd, wordt ingesloten.   
6.  De voorgaande bepalingen zijn niet van toepassing op zogenaamde „historische” baaien, noch in de gevallen waarin het systeem van rechte basislijnen als bedoeld in artikel 7 wordt toegepast.   

### Artikel  11  

####Havens

Voor het vaststellen van de begrenzing van de territoriale zee worden de permanente havenwerken die het verst uit de kust zijn gelegen en die een integrerend onderdeel vormen van het havensysteem, beschouwd een onderdeel van de kust te vormen. Buiten de kust gelegen installaties en kunstmatige eilanden worden niet als permanente havenwerken beschouwd.  

### Artikel  12  

####Reden

Reden die normaal gebruikt worden voor het laden, lossen en voor anker gaan van schepen en die anders geheel of gedeeltelijk buiten de buitengrens van de territoriale zee zouden zijn gelegen, worden tot de territoriale zee gerekend.  

### Artikel  13  

####Bij eb droogvallende bodem verheffingen

1.  Een bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffing is een op natuurlijke wijze ontstane landoppervlakte die bij laag tij door water is omgeven en boven water uitsteekt, doch bij hoog tij onder water komt. Indien een bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffing geheel of gedeeltelijk op een afstand tot het vasteland of een eiland ligt, die niet groter is dan de breedte van de territoriale zee, dan kan de laagwaterlijn van die bodemverheffing gebruikt worden als basislijn voor het meten van de breedte van de territoriale zee.   
2.  Indien een bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffing in haar geheel op een afstand van het vasteland of een eiland ligt, die groter is dan de breedte van de territoriale zee, heeft zij geen eigen territoriale zee.   

### Artikel  14  

####Combinatie van methoden voor het vaststellen van basislijnen

De kuststaat kan basislijnen vaststellen met behulp van ongeacht welke methode bepaald in de voorgaande artikelen al naar gelang de diverse omstandigheden.  

### Artikel  15  

####Afbakening van de territoriale zee tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten

In gevallen waarin de kusten van twee Staten tegenover elkaar zijn gelegen of aan elkaar grenzen, is, indien er geen overeenkomst tussen hen bestaat waarin anders wordt bepaald, geen van beide Staten gerechtigd zijn territoriale zee uit te strekken tot voorbij de middellijn waarvan elk punt even ver is verwijderd van de dichtstbijgelegen punten van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee van elk der twee Staten wordt gemeten. Bovenstaande bepaling is echter niet van toepassing in gevallen, waarin het op grond van een historische titel of van andere bijzondere omstandigheden noodzakelijk is de territoriale zeeën van de twee Staten af te bakenen op een daarvan afwijkende wijze.  

### Artikel  16  

####Kaarten en lijsten van geografische coördinaten

1.  De basislijnen voor de meting van de breedte van de territoriale zee, vastgesteld overeenkomstig de artikelen 7, 9 en 10, of de daaruit verkregen grenzen, en de afbakeningslijnen getrokken overeenkomstig de artikelen 12 en 15 dienen te worden aangegeven op kaarten uitgevoerd op een schaal of schalen groot genoeg om hun positie te kunnen vaststellen. Deze kunnen worden vervangen door een lijst van geografische coördinaten van punten, met opgave van het geodetisch reductievlak.   
2.  De kuststaten geven voldoende bekendheid aan zodanige kaarten of lijsten van geografische coördinaten en leggen een exemplaar van zulk een kaart of lijst neder bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### AFDELING  3  

####ONSCHULDIGE DOORVAART IN DE TERRITORIALE ZEE

### ONDERAFDELING  A  

####REGELS DIE VAN TOEPASSING ZIJN OP ALLE SCHEPEN

### Artikel  17  

####Recht van onschuldige doorvaart

Onder voorbehoud van dit Verdrag genieten schepen van alle Staten, ongeacht of zij kuststaten zijn of niet, het recht van onschuldige doorvaart door de territoriale zee.  

### Artikel  18  

####Betekenis van doorvaart

1.  Doorvaart betekent het varen door de territoriale zee: 

a. zonder de bedoeling de binnenwateren binnen te varen of een buiten de binnenwateren gelegen rede of havenvoorziening aan te lopen; of  

b. de binnenwateren binnen of uit te varen of zulk een rede of havenvoorziening aan te lopen.     
2.  De doorvaart dient snel en ononderbroken te zijn. Doorvaart omvat evenwel het stoppen en voor anker gaan, doch alleen voor zover zulks een onderdeel vormt van de normale navigatie of noodzakelijk wordt als gevolg van overmacht of van het feit dat het schip in nood verkeert of voor het verlenen van hulp aan in gevaar of nood verkerende personen, schepen of luchtvaartuigen.   

### Artikel  19  

####Betekenis van onschuldige doorvaart

1.  De doorvaart is onschuldig zolang zij geen gevaar oplevert voor de vrede, de orde of de veiligheid van de kuststaat. Een zodanige doorvaart moet plaats vinden overeenkomstig dit Verdrag en de andere regels van het internationaal recht.   
2.  De doorvaart van een vreemd schip wordt geacht gevaar op te leveren voor de vrede, de orde of de veiligheid van de kuststaat indien het zich in de territoriale zee bezighoudt met enigerlei van de onderstaande activiteiten: 

a. bedreiging met of gebruik van geweld tegen de soevereiniteit, territoriale integriteit of politieke onafhankelijkheid van de kuststaat of enigerlei andere handelwijze die in strijd is met de beginselen van het internationale recht, vervat in het Handvest der Verenigde Naties;  

b. oefeningen met wapens van enigerlei aard;  

c. handelwijzen gericht op het vergaren van informatie ten nadele van de verdediging of de veiligheid van de kuststaat;  

d. propagandistische handelwijzen gericht op aantasting van de verdediging of de veiligheid van de kuststaat;  

e. het doen opstijgen, doen landen of het aan boord nemen van luchtvaartuigen;  

f. het lanceren, doen landen of het aan boord nemen van militair materieel;  

g. het in- of ontschepen van goederen, valuta of personen in strijd met de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat inzake douane, belastingen, immigratie of de volksgezondheid;  

h. opzettelijke en ernstige verontreiniging in strijd met dit Verdrag;  

i. beoefening van de visserij;  

j. het verrichten van onderzoek of karteringswerkzaamheden;  

k. handelwijzen gericht op de verstoring van communicatiesystemen of van andere voorzieningen of installaties van de kuststaat;  

l. andere activiteiten die niet rechtstreeks samenhangen met de doorvaart.     

### Artikel  20  

####Onderzeeboten en andere middelen om zich onder water te verplaatsen

In de territoriale zee zijn onderzeeboten en andere middelen om zich onder water te verplaatsen, verplicht aan de oppervlakte te varen en hun vlag te tonen.  

### Artikel  21  

####Wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat betreffende de onschuldige doorvaart

1.  De kuststaat kan, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en andere regels van het internationale recht, wetten en voorschriften aannemen betreffende de onschuldige doorvaart door de territoriale zee, ten aanzien van de onderstaande aangelegenheden: 

a. de veiligheid van de scheepvaart en de regeling van het verkeer op zee;  

b. de bescherming van hulpmiddelen bij en voorzieningen voor de navigatie en van andere voorzieningen of installaties;  

c. de bescherming van kabels en pijpleidingen;  

d. het behoud van de levende rijkdommen van de zee;  

e. het voorkomen van inbreuken op de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat inzake visserij;  

f. de bescherming van het milieu van de kuststaat en het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van de verontreiniging ervan;  

g. wetenschappelijk zeeonderzoek en hydrografische karteringswerkzaamheden;  

h. het voorkomen van inbreuken op de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat inzake douane, belastingen, immigratie of de volksgezondheid.     
2.  Deze wetten en voorschriften zijn niet van toepassing op het ontwerp, de constructie, het bemannen of de uitrusting van vreemde schepen, tenzij deze uitvoering geven aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels of normen.   
3.  De kuststaat geeft voldoende bekendheid aan al deze wetten en voorschriften.   
4.  Vreemde schepen die het recht van onschuldige doorvaart door de territoriale zee uitoefenen, dienen al deze wetten en voorschriften alsmede alle algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften ter voorkoming van aanvaringen op zee, na te leven.   

### Artikel  22  

####Scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels in de territoriale zee

1.  Waar nodig gezien de veiligheid van de scheepvaart kan de kuststaat van vreemde schepen die het recht van onschuldige doorvaart door zijn territoriale zee uitoefenen, eisen dat deze de door de Staat voor de regeling van de doorvaart van schepen aangewezen of voorgeschreven scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels gebruiken.   
2.  In het bijzonder kan van tankschepen, nucleair voortgestuwde schepen en schepen die radioactieve of andere intrinsiek gevaarlijke of schadelijke stoffen of materialen vervoeren, worden geëist dat zij zich bij hun doorvaart tot zulke scheepvaartroutes beperken.   
3.  Bij de aanwijzing van scheepvaartroutes en het voorschrijven van verkeersscheidingsstelsels ingevolge dit artikel, houdt de kuststaat rekening met: 

a. de aanbevelingen van de bevoegde internationale organisatie;  

b. de vaarwateren die gewoonlijk voor de internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt;  

c. de bijzondere kenmerken van bepaalde schepen en vaarwateren; en  

d. de verkeersdichtheid.     
4.  De kuststaat geeft zodanige scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels duidelijk aan op kaarten, waaraan naar behoren bekendheid wordt gegeven.   

### Artikel  23  

####Vreemde nucleair voortgestuwde schepen en schepen die radioactieve of andere intrinsiek gevaarlijke of schadelijke stoffen vervoeren

Vreemde nucleair voortgestuwde schepen en schepen die radioactieve of andere intrinsiek gevaarlijke of schadelijke stoffen vervoeren dienen, bij de uitoefening van het recht van onschuldige doorvaart door de territoriale zee, de documenten aan boord te hebben en de speciale voorzorgsmaatregelen na te leven die bij internationale overeenkomsten voor zulke schepen zijn vastgesteld.  

### Artikel  24  

####Plichten van de kuststaat

1.  De kuststaat mag de onschuldige doorvaart van vreemde schepen door de territoriale zee niet belemmeren, behalve overeenkomstig dit Verdrag. Inzonderheid mag de kuststaat, bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag of van wetten of voorschriften aangenomen overeenkomstig dit Verdrag, niet: 

a. aan vreemde schepen verplichtingen opleggen die het gevolg hebben dat daardoor het recht van onschuldige doorvaart wordt ontzegd of aangetast;  

b. rechtens of in feite onderscheid maken ten aanzien van schepen van een Staat of tegen schepen die lading vervoeren naar, van of namens een Staat.     
2.  De kuststaat dient voldoende bekendheid te geven aan alle hem bekende gevaren voor de navigatie in zijn territoriale zee.   

### Artikel  25  

####Rechten van bescherming van de kuststaat

1.  De kuststaat kan binnen zijn territoriale zee de maatregelen nemen die nodig zijn om een doorvaart die niet onschuldig is, te voorkomen.   
2.  In het geval van schepen die zich begeven naar de binnenwateren of een haveninstallatie buiten de binnenwateren, heeft de kuststaat eveneens het recht de maatregelen te nemen die noodzakelijk zijn om te voorkomen, dat inbreuk wordt gepleegd op de voorwaarden waaraan de toelating van die schepen tot die binnenwateren of haveninstallatie is onderworpen.   
3.  De kuststaat kan, zonder rechtens of in feite onderscheid te maken tussen schepen van vreemde nationaliteit, in bepaalde gebieden van zijn territoriale zee de uitoefening van het recht van onschuldige doorvaart van vreemde schepen tijdelijk opschorten, indien die opschorting noodzakelijk is voor de bescherming van zijn veiligheid, met inbegrip van wapenoefeningen. Een zodanige opschorting wordt slechts van kracht nadat zij op behoorlijke wijze is bekendgemaakt.   

### Artikel  26  

####Kosten die aan vreemde schepen in rekening mogen worden gebracht

1.  Aan vreemde schepen mag niets in rekening worden gebracht louter op grond van het feit, dat zij door de territoriale zee varen.   
2.  Aan een vreemd schip dat door de territoriale zee vaart, mogen alleen kosten in rekening worden gebracht voor bepaalde ten behoeve van het schip verrichte diensten. Deze kosten worden in rekening gebracht zonder dat enig onderscheid wordt gemaakt.   

### ONDERAFDELING  B  

####REGELS DIE VAN TOEPASSING ZIJN OP KOOPVAARDIJSCHEPEN EN OP STAATSSCHEPEN DIE VOOR COMMERCIËLE DOELEINDEN WORDEN GEBRUIKT

### Artikel  27  

####Rechtsmacht in strafrechtelijke aangelegenheden aan boord van een vreemd schip

1.  De rechtsmacht in strafrechtelijke aangelegenheden van de kuststaat dient niet te worden uitgeoefend aan boord van een door de territoriale wateren varend vreemd schip met het oogmerk een persoon te arresteren of een onderzoek in te stellen in verband met een aan boord van het schip tijdens de doorvaart bedreven strafbaar feit, behalve in de volgende gevallen: 

a. indien de gevolgen van het strafbare feit zich uitstrekken tot de kuststaat;  

b. indien het strafbaar feit van dien aard is, dat daardoor de orde in het land of de orde op de territoriale zee wordt verstoord;  

c. indien door de kapitein van het schip of door een diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaar van de vlaggestaat de hulp van de plaatselijke autoriteiten is ingeroepen;  

d. indien zulke maatregelen noodzakelijk zijn voor de bestrijding van de handel in verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen.     
2.  Bovenstaande bepalingen doen geen afbreuk aan het recht van de kuststaat de maatregelen waartoe hij krachtens zijn wetgeving gemachtigd is, te treffen voor een arrestatie of een onderzoek aan boord van een vreemd schip dat door de territoriale zee vaart nadat het de binnenwateren heeft verlaten.   
3.  In de in het eerste en het tweede lid bedoelde gevallen dient de kuststaat, indien de kapitein zulks verzoekt, een diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaar van de vlaggestaat op de hoogte te stellen alvorens tot het treffen van maatregelen over te gaan, en het contact tussen deze ambtenaar en de bemanning van het schip te vergemakkelijken. In noodgevallen kan deze mededeling worden gedaan terwijl de maatregelen reeds getroffen worden.   
4.  Bij de overweging van de vraag of, en zo ja, op welke wijze een arrestatie verricht dient te worden, moeten de plaatselijke autoriteiten rekening houden met de belangen van de scheepvaart.   
5.  Behalve zoals bepaald in Deel XII of met betrekking tot schendingen van overeenkomstig Deel V aangenomen wetten en voorschriften, mag de kuststaat aan boord van een door de territoriale zee varend schip geen maatregelen treffen met het oogmerk iemand te arresteren of een onderzoek in te stellen in verband met een strafbaar feit dat aan boord werd bedreven voor het schip de territoriale zee binnenvoer, indien het schip, komende van een buitenlandse haven, slechts door de territoriale zee vaart zonder de binnenwateren binnen te varen.   

### Artikel  28  

####Rechtsmacht in burgerrechtelijke aangelegenheden ten aanzien van vreemde schepen

1.  De kuststaat mag een vreemd schip dat door zijn territoriale zee vaart niet dwingen te stoppen of een andere koers te volgen met het oogmerk zijn rechtsmacht in burgerrechtelijke aangelegenheden uit te oefenen ten aanzien van een persoon aan boord van dat schip.   
2.  De kuststaat mag geen executoire of conservatoire maatregelen tegen het schip treffen ten behoeve van een civiele procedure, behalve in verband met verplichtingen die door het schip zijn aangegaan of aansprakelijkheden die voor het schip zijn ontstaan tijdens of met het oog op zijn reis door de wateren van de kuststaat.   
3.  Het tweede lid doet geen afbreuk aan het recht van de kuststaat om, overeenkomstig zijn wetgeving, executoire of conservatoire maatregelen ten behoeve van civiele procedures te treffen ten aanzien van een vreemd schip dat in de territoriale zee ligt of door de territoriale zee vaart na de binnenwateren te hebben verlaten.   

### ONDERAFDELING  C  

####REGELS DIE VAN TOEPASSING ZIJN OP OORLOGSSCHEPEN EN OP ANDERE STAATSSCHEPEN DIE WORDEN GEBRUIKT VOOR ANDERE DAN COMMERCIËLE DOELEINDEN

### Artikel  29  

####Begripsomschrijving van oorlogsschepen

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt onder een „oorlogsschip” verstaan een schip dat behoort tot de strijdkrachten van een Staat en dat de uiterlijke onderscheidingstekenen draagt van zulke schepen van zijn nationaliteit. De commandant moet in staatsdienst zijn en zijn naam moet voorkomen in de desbetreffende dienstlijst of het equivalent daarvan, en de bemanning moet onderworpen zijn aan de regels van de krijgstucht.  

### Artikel  30  

####Niet-naleving door oorlogsschepen van de wetgeving en voorschriften van de kuststaat

Indien een oorlogsschip de wetgeving en voorschriften van de kuststaat ten aanzien van de vaart door de territoriale zee niet in acht neemt en verzoeken om deze in acht te nemen negeert, kan de kuststaat van het oorlogsschip eisen, dat het de territoriale zee onverwijld verlaat.  

### Artikel  31  

####Verantwoordelijkheid van de vlaggestaat voor schade veroorzaakt door een oorlogsschip of een ander staatsschip dat wordt gebruikt voor andere dan commerciële doeleinden

De vlaggestaat draagt internationale verantwoordelijkheid voor verliezen of schade voor de kuststaat voortvloeiend uit de niet-naleving door een oorlogsschip of ander staatsschip dat wordt gebruikt voor andere dan commerciële doeleinden, van de wetgeving en voorschriften van de kuststaat ten aanzien van de vaart door de territoriale zee of niet-naleving van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van andere regels van het internationale recht.  

### Artikel  32  

####Immuniteiten van oorlogsschepen en van andere staatsschepen die worden gebruikt voor andere dan commerciële doeleinden

Met inachtneming van de uitzonderingen vervat in Onderafdeling A en in de artikelen 30 en 31, doet niets in dit Verdrag afbreuk aan de immuniteiten van oorlogsschepen en van andere staatsschepen die worden gebruikt voor andere dan commerciële doeleinden.  

### AFDELING  4  

####DE AANSLUITENDE ZONE

### Artikel  33  

####De aansluitende zone

1.  In een zone van de volle zee die grenst aan zijn territoriale zee, beschreven als de aansluitende zone, mag de kuststaat toezicht uitoefenen ten einde: 

a. te voorkomen dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de wetten en voorschriften inzake douane, belastingen, immigratie of volksgezondheid, die binnen zijn gebied of territoriale zee van kracht zijn;  

b. een binnen zijn grondgebied of territoriale zee gemaakte inbreuk op bovenbedoelde wetten en voorschriften te bestraffen.     
2.  De aansluitende zone mag zich niet verder uitstrekken dan 24 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten.   

### DEEL  III  

####ZEESTRATEN GEBRUIKT VOOR DE INTERNATIONALE SCHEEPVAART

### AFDELING  1  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  34  

####Juridische status van wateren die zeestraten vormen en die voor de internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt

1.  De in dit Deel vastgestelde regeling voor de vaart door zeestraten die voor de internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt, doet niet in ander opzicht afbreuk aan de juridische status van de wateren die zulke zeestraten vormen of aan de uitoefening door aan de zeestraten grenzende Staten van hun soevereiniteit of hun rechtsmacht over zodanige wateren en over het luchtruim erboven en over de bodem en ondergrond daarvan.   
2.  De soevereiniteit of rechtsmacht van de aan de zeestraat grenzende Staten wordt uitgeoefend met inachtneming van dit Deel en van andere regels van het internationale recht.   

### Artikel  35  

####Reikwijdte van dit Deel

Niets in dit Deel is van invloed op: 

a. gebieden van binnenwateren binnen een zeestraat, behalve waar de vaststelling van een rechte basislijn overeenkomstig de methode vervat in artikel 7 ertoe leidt dat gebieden die voordien niet als binnenwateren werden beschouwd, als zodanig worden ingesloten;  

b. de juridische status van de wateren buiten de territoriale zeeën van de aan zeestraten grenzende Staten als exclusieve economische zones of als de volle zee;  

c. de juridische status van zeestraten waarin de doorvaart geheel of gedeeltelijk wordt geregeld door reeds lang van kracht zijnde internationale verdragen die specifiek op deze zeestraten betrekking hebben.    

### Artikel  36  

####Routes in de volle zee of routes door exclusieve economische zones via zeestraten gebruikt voor de internationale scheepvaart

Dit Deel is niet van toepassing op een zeestraat die voor de internationale scheepvaart wordt gebruikt indien er via de zeestraat een route door de volle zee of door een exclusieve economische zone bestaat van vergelijkbare geschiktheid wat de scheepvaart en de hydrografische kenmerken betreft; op zulke routes zijn de andere desbetreffende Delen van dit Verdrag, met inbegrip van de bepalingen inzake de vrijheid van de scheepvaart en de vrijheid van overvliegen van toepassing.  

### AFDELING  2  

####DOORTOCHT

### Artikel  37  

####Reikwijdte van deze afdeling

Deze afdeling is van toepassing op zeestraten die voor de internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt tussen het ene deel van de volle zee of van een exclusieve economische zone en het andere deel van de volle zee of van een exclusieve economische zone.  

### Artikel  38  

####Recht van doortocht

1.  In de zeestraten bedoeld in artikel 37 genieten alle schepen en luchtvaartuigen het recht van doortocht, dat niet mag worden belemmerd; met dien verstande dat, indien de zeestraat wordt gevormd door een eiland van een Staat die aan de zeestraat grenst en het vasteland van die Staat, de doortocht niet van toepassing is indien er aan de zeezijde van het eiland een route bestaat door de volle zee of door een exclusieve economische zone van vergelijkbare geschiktheid wat de scheepvaart en de hydrografische kenmerken betreft.   
2.  Doortocht betekent de uitoefening overeenkomstig dit Deel van de vrijheid van scheepvaart en de vrijheid van overvliegen uitsluitend ten behoeve van een ononderbroken en snelle doortocht van de zeestraat tussen het ene deel van de volle zee of van een exclusieve economische zone en het andere deel van de volle zee of van een exclusieve economische zone. De eis van ononderbroken en snelle doortocht sluit evenwel niet de doorvaart door de zeestraat uit ten behoeve van het binnenvaren van, het uitvaren uit of het terugkeren van een aan de zeestraat grenzende Staat, behoudens de voorwaarden voor binnenkomst in die Staat.   
3.  Elke activiteit die geen betrekking heeft op de uitoefening van het recht van doortocht via een zeestraat blijft onderworpen aan de andere van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  39  

####Plichten van schepen en luchtvaartuigen tijdens de doortocht

1.  Schepen en luchtvaartuigen dienen bij de uitoefening van het recht van doortocht: 

a. zonder verwijl door of over de zeestraat te gaan;  

b. zich te onthouden van bedreiging met of gebruik van geweld tegen de soevereiniteit, territoriale integriteit of politieke onafhankelijkheid van aan de zeestraat grenzende Staten of van enigerlei andere handelwijze die in strijd is met de beginselen van het internationale recht vervat in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties;  

c. zich te onthouden van andere activiteiten dan die welke behoren bij een normale ononderbroken en snelle doortocht, tenzij zulks noodzakelijk is wegens overmacht of het verkeren in nood;  

d. andere ter zake dienende bepalingen van dit Deel na te komen,     
2.  Schepen in doortocht dienen: 

a. te voldoen aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften, procedures en praktijken voor de veiligheid op zee, met inbegrip van de Internationale Voorschriften ter voorkoming van aanvaringen op zee;  

b. te voldoen aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften, procedures en praktijken ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen.     
3.  Luchtvaartuigen in doortocht dienen: 

a. zich te houden aan de luchtvaartregels vastgesteld door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie die van toepassing zijn op burgerluchtvaartuigen; staatsluchtvaartuigen voldoen normaal aan de veiligheidsmaatregelen en er wordt te allen tijde mee gevlogen met behoorlijke inachtneming van de veiligheid van de luchtvaart;  

b. te allen tijde de door de bevoegde internationaal aangewezen instantie voor het toezicht op het luchtverkeer toegewezen radiofrequentie of de desbetreffende internationale radionoodfrequentie uit te luisteren.     

### Artikel  40  

####Onderzoek- en karteringswerkzaamheden

Tijdens de doortocht mogen vreemde schepen, met inbegrip van schepen voor wetenschappelijk zeeonderzoek en schepen voor hydrografische karteringswerkzaamheden geen onderzoek of karteringswerkzaamheden verrichten zonder de voorafgaande machtiging van de aan de zeestraten grenzende Staten.  

### Artikel  41  

####Scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels in voor de internationale scheepvaart gebruikte zeestraten

1.  Overeenkomstig dit Deel kunnen aan zeestraten grenzende Staten scheepvaartroutes aanwijzen en verkeersscheidingsstelsels voorschrijven voor de scheepvaart in zeestraten indien zulks nodig is ter bevordering van de veilige doorvaart van de schepen.   
2.  Deze Staten kunnen, wanneer de omstandigheden zulks vereisen, en na hieraan voldoende bekendheid te hebben gegeven, voordien door hen aangewezen of voorgeschreven scheepvaartroutes of verkeersscheidingsstelsels, vervangen door andere scheepvaartroutes of verkeersscheidingsstelsels.   
3.  Deze scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften.   
4.  Alvorens scheepvaartroutes aan te wijzen of te vervangen of verkeersscheidingsstelsels voor te schrijven of te vervangen, leggen aan zeestraten grenzende Staten de voorstellen voor aan de bevoegde internationale organisatie met het oog op de aanvaarding ervan. De organisatie kan alleen die scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels aanvaarden die zijn overeengekomen met de aan de zeestraten grenzende Staten, waarna de Staten deze kunnen aanwijzen, voorschrijven of vervangen.   
5.  Ten aanzien van een zeestraat waarvoor scheepvaartroutes of verkeersscheidingsstelsels door de wateren van twee of meer aan de zeestraat grenzende Staten worden voorgesteld, dienen de betrokken Staten samen te werken bij het formuleren van voorstellen, in overleg met de bevoegde internationale organisatie.   
6.  Aan zeestraten grenzende Staten dienen alle scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels die door hen worden aangewezen of voorgeschreven duidelijk aan te geven op kaarten waaraan voldoende bekendheid wordt gegeven.   
7.  Schepen in doortocht houden zich aan de van toepassing zijnde scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels als vastgesteld overeenkomstig dit artikel.   

### Artikel  42  

####Wetten en voorschriften van aan zeestraten grenzende Staten betreffende de doortocht

1.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van deze afdeling kunnen aan zeestraten grenzende Staten wetten en voorschriften aannemen betreffende de doortocht door zeestraten met betrekking tot enige of alle der volgende aangelegenheden: 

a. de veiligheid van de scheepvaart en de regeling van het scheepvaartverkeer, bedoeld in artikel 41;  

b. het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van verontreiniging, door uitvoering te geven aan van toepassing zijnde internationale voorschriften betreffende het lozen van olie, olie bevattende afvalprodukten en andere schadelijke stoffen in de zeestraat;  

c. met betrekking tot vissersschepen, het voorkomen van de uitoefening van de visserij, met inbegrip van het aan boord hebben van vistuig;  

d. het in- of ontschepen van goederen, valuta of personen in strijd met de wetten en voorschriften van de aan zeestraten grenzende Staten inzake douane, belastingen, immigratie of de volksgezondheid.     
2.  Deze wetten en voorschriften mogen niet rechtens of in feite onderscheid maken tussen vreemde schepen of in hun toepassing tot gevolg hebben dat het recht van doortocht zoals omschreven in deze afdeling wordt ontzegd, belemmerd of dat daaraan afbreuk wordt gedaan.   
3.  Aan zeestraten grenzende Staten dienen voldoende bekendheid te geven aan al deze wetten en voorschriften.   
4.  Vreemde schepen die het recht van doortocht uitoefenen, dienen zulke wetten en voorschriften na te leven.   
5.  De vlaggestaat van een schip of de Staat van registratie van een luchtvaartuig dat soevereine immuniteit geniet, en dat handelt op een wijze strijdig met deze wetten en voorschriften of andere bepalingen van dit Deel, draagt internationale verantwoordelijkheid voor daaruit voor aan zeestraten grenzende staten voortvloeiende verliezen of schade.   

### Artikel  43  

####Hulpmiddelen bij de navigatie en veiligheidsmiddelen en andere verbeteringen en het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van verontreiniging

Van een zeestraat gebruik makende en aan een zeestraat grenzende staten dienen bij overeenkomst samen te werken:

b. ten einde verontreiniging door schepen te voorkomen, te verminderen en te bestrijden.    

### Artikel  44  

####Plichten van aan zeestraten grenzende Staten

Aan zeestraten grenzende Staten mogen de doortocht niet belemmeren en dienen passende bekendheid te geven aan hun bekende gevaren voor de scheepvaart binnen, of voor het overvliegen boven de zeestraat. De doortocht mag niet worden opgeschort.  

### AFDELING  3  

####ONSCHULDIGE DOORVAART

### Artikel  45  

####Onschuldige doorvaart

1.  De regeling van onschuldige doorvaart overeenkomstig Deel II, afdeling 3, is van toepassing in voor internationale scheepvaart gebruikte zeestraten: 

a. die zijn uitgesloten van de toepassing van de regeling van doortocht ingevolge artikel 38, eerste lid; of  

b. tussen een deel van de volle zee of een exclusieve economische zone en de territoriale zee van een vreemde Staat.     
2.  De onschuldige doorvaart door deze zeestraten mag niet worden opgeschort.   

### DEEL  IV  

####ARCHIPELSTATEN

### Artikel  46  

####Gebruik van termen

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag betekent: 

a. „archipelstaat” een Staat die geheel wordt gevormd door een of meer archipels en eventueel andere eilanden;  

b. „archipel” een groep eilanden, met inbegrip van delen van eilanden, verbindingswateren en andere natuurlijke bestanddelen die zo nauw verweven zijn dat zulke eilanden, wateren en andere natuurlijke kenmerken een intrinsiek geografische, economische en politieke eenheid vormen, of die historisch als zodanig worden beschouwd.    

### Artikel  47  

####Archipel-basislijnen

1.  Een archipelstaat mag rechte archipel-basislijnen trekken die de uiterste punten van de uiterste eilanden en bij eb droogvallende riffen van de archipel met elkaar verbinden, mits binnen zulke basislijnen de voornaamste eilanden vallen alsmede een gebied waarin de verhouding van het wateroppervlak tot het landoppervlak, atollen inbegrepen, ligt tussen 1 tot 1 en 9 tot 1.   
2.  De lengte van zulke basislijnen mag niet langer zijn dan 100 zeemijl, met de uitzondering dat ten hoogste drie procent van het totale aantal basislijnen die een archipel insluiten langer mag zijn, tot een maximumlengte van 125 zeemijl.   
3.  Aldus getrokken basislijnen mogen niet aanmerkelijk afwijken van de algemene omtrek van de archipel.   
4.  Er mogen geen basislijnen worden getrokken van en naar bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffingen, tenzij er vuurtorens of soortgelijke installaties die duurzaam boven zee uitsteken, op gebouwd zijn, of wanneer een bij eb droogvallende bodemverheffing geheel of gedeeltelijk is gelegen op een afstand niet groter dan de breedte van de territoriale zee vanaf het dichtstbijzijnde eiland.   
5.  De methode van zodanige basislijnen mag door een archipelstaat niet op zodanige wijze worden toegepast, dat daardoor de territoriale zee van een andere Staat van de volle zee of de exclusieve economische zone zou worden afgesneden.   
6.  Indien een deel van de archipelwateren van een archipelstaat ligt tussen twee delen van een onmiddellijk daaraan grenzende buurstaat, blijven bestaande rechten en alle andere wettige belangen die laatstgenoemde Staat van oudsher in zodanige wateren heeft uitgeoefend en alle bij overeenkomst tussen deze Staten bepaalde rechten geëerbiedigd.   
7.  Voor de berekening van de verhouding tussen water en land ingevolge het eerste lid, kunnen landgebieden wateren omvatten, liggend binnen de reeks van riffen van eilanden en atollen, met inbegrip van dat deel van een oceaanplateau met steile kanten dat wordt omsloten of bijna omsloten door een keten van kalkstenen eilanden en bij eb droogvallende riffen, liggend op de omtrek van het plateau.   
8.  De overeenkomstig dit artikel getrokken basislijnen worden aangegeven op zeekaarten van een schaal of schalen groot genoeg om hun positie te kunnen vaststellen. Deze kunnen worden vervangen door lijsten van geografische coördinaten van punten, met opgave van het geodetisch reductievlak.   

### Artikel  48  

####Meting van de breedte van de territoriale zee, de aansluitende zone, de exclusieve economische zone en liet continentaal plat

De breedte van de territoriale zee, de aansluitende zone, de exclusieve economische zone en het continentaal plat wordt gemeten vanaf de overeenkomstig artikel 47 getrokken archipel-basislijnen.  

### Artikel  49  

####Juridische status van de archipelzee, van het luchtruim boven de archipelzee en van de bodem en ondergrond van die zee

1.  De soevereiniteit van een archipelstaat strekt zich uit tot de zee omsloten door de archipel-basislijnen, getrokken overeenkomstig artikel 47, archipelzee genoemd, ongeacht hun diepte of afstand van de kust.   
2.  Deze soevereiniteit strekt zich uit over het luchtruim boven de archipelzee en over de bodem en ondergrond van die zee, en de zich daarin bevindende natuurlijke rijkdommen.   
3.  Deze soevereiniteit wordt uitgeoefend onder voorbehoud van dit Deel.   
4.  De regeling van doorvaart via scheepvaartroutes in de archipel vastgesteld in dit Deel is niet in andere opzichten van invloed op de status van de archipelzee, met inbegrip van scheepvaartroutes, of de uitoefening door de archipelstaat van zijn soevereiniteit over deze zee en het luchtruim boven de zee en de bodem en ondergrond van die zee en de zich daarin bevindende natuurlijke rijkdommen.   

### Artikel  50  

####Afbakening van de binnenwateren

De archipelstaat kan binnen zijn archipelzee afsluitingslijnen trekken voor de afbakening van de binnenwateren, overeenkomstig de artikelen 9, 10 en 11.  

### Artikel  51  

####Bestaande overeenkomsten, van oudsher bestaande visrechten en bestaande onderzeese kabels

1.  Onverminderd artikel 49 eerbiedigt een archipelstaat bestaande overeenkomsten met andere Staten en erkent hij van oudsher bestaande visrechten en andere wettige activiteiten van de onmiddellijk aangrenzende buurstaten in bepaalde gebieden vallend binnen de archipelzee. De aard, de omvang en de gebieden waarvoor deze gelden, worden op verzoek van een der betrokken Staten geregeld bij bilaterale overeenkomsten tussen deze Staten. Zodanige rechten mogen niet worden overgedragen aan of gedeeld met derde Staten of hun onderdanen.   
2.  Een archipelstaat ontziet bestaande onderzeese kabels, gelegd door andere Staten die door zijn zee lopen zonder de oevers te raken. Een archipelstaat staat het onderhoud aan en de vervanging van zodanige kabels toe na tijdig te zijn verwittigd van hun ligging en van het voornemen deze te herstellen of te vervangen.   

### Artikel  52  

####Recht van onschuldige doorvaart

1.  Behoudens artikel 53 en onverminderd artikel 50 genieten schepen van alle Staten het recht van onschuldige doorvaart door een archipelzee overeenkomstig Deel II, afdeling 3.   
2.  De archipelstaat kan, zonder rechtens of in feite onderscheid te maken tussen vreemde schepen, in nader aangegeven gebieden van zijn archipelzee de onschuldige doorvaart van vreemde schepen tijdelijk opschorten, indien een zodanige opschorting noodzakelijk is voor de bescherming van zijn veiligheid. Een zodanige opschorting wordt eerst van kracht nadat daaraan voldoende bekendheid is gegeven.   

### Artikel  53  

####Recht van doorgang via scheepvaartroutes in de archipel

1.  Een archipelstaat kan scheepvaartroutes en luchtroutes daarboven aanwijzen, die geschikt zijn voor de ononderbroken en snelle doorgang van vreemde schepen en luchtvaartuigen door of boven zijn archipelzee en de aangrenzende territoriale zee.   
2.  Alle schepen en luchtvaartuigen genieten het recht van doorgang via zulke scheepvaartroutes in de archipel en via zodanige luchtroutes.   
3.  Doorgang via scheepvaartroutes in de archipel betekent de uitoefening overeenkomstig dit Verdrag van het recht van scheepvaart en het recht van overvliegen op de normale wijze, uitsluitend ten behoeve van een ononderbroken, snelle en onbelemmerde doortocht tussen het ene deel van de volle zee of een exclusieve economische zone en het andere deel van de volle zee of een exclusieve economische zone.   
4.  Zodanige scheepvaartroutes en luchtroutes lopen door of boven de archipelzee en de aangrenzende territoriale zee en omvatten alle normale doorgangsroutes, gebruikt als routes voor de internationale scheepvaart door of het internationale luchtvervoer boven de archipelzee en, binnen zodanige routes, wat schepen betreft, alle normale vaarwateren voor de scheepvaart, met dien verstande dat dubbele routes van vergelijkbare geschiktheid tussen dezelfde punten van binnenkomst en vertrek niet nodig zijn.   
5.  Zodanige scheepvaartroutes en luchtroutes worden omschreven door een reeks doorgetrokken aslijnen vanaf de punten van binnenkomst van doorgangsroutes tot de punten van vertrek. Schepen en luchtvaartuigen in doorgang langs de boven een scheepvaartroute in een archipel mogen tijdens de doorgang niet meer dan 25 zeemijl aan weerskanten van de aslijnen afwijken, met dien verstande dat zodanige schepen en luchtvaartuigen niet dichter bij de kusten mogen varen of vliegen dan 10 procent van de afstand tussen de dichtstbijzijnde punten op aan de scheepvaartroute grenzende eilanden.   
6.  Een archipelstaat die krachtens dit artikel scheepvaartroutes aanwijst, kan ook verkeersscheidingsstelsels voorschrijven voor de veilige doorvaart van schepen door nauwe vaarwateren in zodanige scheepvaartroutes.   
7.  Indien de omstandigheden zulks vereisen, kan een archipelstaat, na hieraan voldoende bekendheid te hebben gegeven, voordien door hem aangewezen of voorgeschreven scheepvaartroutes of verkeersscheidingsstelsels vervangen door andere scheepvaartroutes of verkeersscheidingsstelsels.   
8.  Zodanige scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften.   
9.  Bij het aanwijzen of vervangen van scheepvaartroutes of het voorschrijven of vervangen van verkeersscheidingsstelsels, legt een archipelstaat de voorstellen voor aan de bevoegde internationale organisatie met het oog op de aanvaarding ervan. De organisatie kan alleen die scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels aanvaarden die zijn overeengekomen met de archipelstaat, waarna de archipelstaat deze kan aanwijzen, voorschrijven of vervangen.   
10.  De archipelstaat geeft de as van de door hem aangewezen of voorgeschreven scheepvaarroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels duidelijk aan op kaarten waaraan voldoende bekendheid wordt gegeven.   
11.  Schepen in doorvaart langs scheepvaartroutes in de archipel houden zich aan de van toepassing zijnde scheepvaartroutes en verkeersscheidingsstelsels, vastgesteld overeenkomstig dit artikel.   
12.  Indien een archipelstaat geen scheepvaartroutes of luchtroutes aanwijst, kan het recht van doorgang langs scheepvaartroutes in de archipelzee worden uitgeoefend via de gewoonlijk voor internationale scheepvaart gebruikte routes.   

### Artikel  54  

####Plichten van schepen en luchtvaartuigen tijdens hun doorgang, onderzoeks- en karteringswerkzaamheden, plichten van de archipelstaat en wetten en voorschriften van de archipelstaat betreffende de doorvaart via, alsmede het vliegen boven scheepvaartroutes in de archipel

De artikelen 39, 40, 42 en 44 zijn mutatis mutandis van toepassing op doorvaart via, alsmede het vliegen boven scheepvaartroutes in de archipel.

####Grondslag voor de oplossing van conflicten betreffende de toekenning van rechten en rechtsmacht in de exclusieve economische zone

In gevallen waarin dit Verdrag de kuststaat of andere Staten geen rechten of rechtsmacht binnen de exclusieve economische zone toekent, en er een conflict ontstaat tussen de belangen van de kuststaat en van een andere Staat of andere Staten, dient het conflict te worden opgelost op de grondslag van billijkheid en in het licht van alle van belang zijnde omstandigheden, met inachtneming van het onderscheiden gewicht van de erbij betrokken belangen voor de partijen, alsook voor de gehele internationale gemeenschap.  

### Artikel  60  

####Kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen in de exclusieve economische zone

1.  In de exclusieve economische zone heeft de kuststaat het uitsluitende recht te bouwen en de bouw, de werkzaamheden en het gebruik te machtigen en te regelen van: 

a. kunstmatige eilanden;  

b. installaties en inrichtingen voor de doeleinden bepaald in artikel 56 en voor andere economische doeleinden;  

c. installaties en inrichtingen die inbreuk kunnen maken op de uitoefening van de rechten van de kuststaat in de zone.     
2.  De kuststaat bezit uitsluitende rechtsmacht over zulke kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen, met inbegrip van rechtsmacht met betrekking tot de wetten en voorschriften inzake douane, belastingen, volksgezondheid, veiligheid en immigratie.   
3.  Van de oprichting van zodanige kunstmatige eilanden, installaties of inrichtingen dient behoorlijk mededeling te worden gedaan en er dient een permanent waarschuwingssysteem in stand te worden gehouden ter aanduiding van hun aanwezigheid. Installaties of inrichtingen die worden verlaten of die niet meer worden gebruikt, dienen geheel te worden verwijderd ter verzekering van de veiligheid van de scheepvaart, zulks met inachtneming van algemeen aanvaarde internationale normen hiertoe vastgesteld door de bevoegde internationale organisatie. Bij deze verwijdering dient naar behoren rekening te worden gehouden met de visserij, de bescherming van het mariene milieu en de rechten en plichten van andere Staten. Er dient passende bekendheid te worden gegeven aan de diepte, positie en afmetingen van alle installaties of inrichtingen die niet geheel zijn verwijderd.   
4.  De kuststaat kan, waar nodig, redelijke veiligheidszones instellen rond zulke kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen, waarbinnen hij passende maatregelen kan nemen ter verzekering van de veiligheid van zowel de scheepvaart als van de kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen.   
5.  De breedte van de veiligheidszone wordt vastgesteld door de kuststaat, met inachtneming van toepasselijke internationale normen. Zulke zones dienen zodanig te zijn dat wordt verzekerd dat zij op redelijke wijze zijn aangepast aan de aard en de functie van de kunstmatige eilanden, installaties of inrichtingen en zij mogen niet groter zijn dan 500 meter rondom, gemeten van elk punt van de buitenste lijn van deze eilanden, installaties of inrichtingen, behalve zoals toegestaan bij algemeen aanvaarde internationale normen of zoals aanbevolen door de bevoegde internationale organisatie. Aan de omvang van de veiligheidszones dient voldoende bekendheid te worden gegeven.   
6.  Alle schepen moeten deze veiligheidszones eerbiedigen en de algemeen aanvaarde internationale normen betreffende scheepvaart in de buurt van kunstmatige eilanden, installaties, inrichtingen en veiligheidszones naleven.   
7.  Kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen mogen niet worden opgericht en de veiligheidszones daaromheen mogen niet worden ingesteld, indien zulks het gebruik van erkende scheepvaartroutes, die van wezenlijk belang zijn voor de internationale scheepvaart, zou belemmeren.   
8.  Kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen bezitten niet de status van eilanden. Zij hebben geen eigen territoriale zee en hun aanwezigheid is niet van invloed op de begrenzing van de territoriale zee, de exclusieve economische zone of het continentale plat.   

### Artikel  61  

####Behoud van de levende rijkdommen

1.  De kuststaat bepaalt de toegestane vangst van de levende rijkdommen in zijn exclusieve economische zone.   
2.  Met inachtneming van de beste wetenschappelijke gegevens waarover hij beschikt, verzekert de kuststaat door middel van passende maatregelen voor behoud en beheer, dat de instandhouding van de levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zone niet door overexploitatie in gevaar wordt gebracht. Waar passend werken de kuststaat en bevoegde internationale, subregionale, regionale dan wel mondiale, organisaties hiertoe samen.   
3.  Zodanige maatregelen dienen er ook op te zijn gericht de populaties van geoogste soorten in stand te houden of weer te brengen op het peil dat een gedurig maximale opbrengst oplevert, zoals nader bepaald door van belang zijnde milieutechnische en economische factoren, met inbegrip van de economische behoeften van gemeenschappen van kustvissers en de bijzondere behoeften van ontwikkelingslanden en met inachtneming van de visserijpatronen, de onderlinge afhankelijkheid van visstapels en algemeen aanbevolen internationale, subregionale, regionale dan wel mondiale, minimumnormen.   
4.  Bij het nemen van zulke maatregelen houdt de kuststaat rekening met de gevolgen voor soorten die in hetzelfde ecosysteem leven als de geoogste soorten, ten einde de populaties van zulke in hetzelfde ecosysteem levende soorten in stand te houden of weer te brengen boven het peil waarop hun voortplanting ernstig kan worden bedreigd.   
5.  De beschikbare wetenschappelijke gegevens, statistieken inzake vangst en visserij-inspanningen, en andere voor het behoud van visstapels van belang zijnde gegevens worden regelmatig bijgedragen en uitgewisseld via bevoegde internationale, subregionale, regionale dan wel mondiale, organisaties, naar gelang passend, en waarin wordt deelgenomen door alle betrokken Staten met inbegrip van Staten wier onderdanen mogen vissen in de exclusieve economische zone.   

### Artikel  62  

####Gebruik van de levende rijkdommen

1.  Onverminderd artikel 61 bevordert de kuststaat het doel van een optimaal gebruik van de levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zone.   
2.  De kuststaat stelt zijn vermogen vast de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zone te oogsten. Wanneer de kuststaat niet over het vermogen beschikt om de gehele toelaatbare vangst te oogsten, verleent hij, door middel van overeenkomsten of andere regelingen en ingevolge de voorwaarden, bedingen, wetten en voorschriften bedoeld in het vierde lid, andere Staten toegang tot het overschot van de toelaatbare vangst, daarbij in het bijzonder in acht nemend de bepalingen van de artikelen 69 en 70, vooral met betrekking tot de daarin bedoelde ontwikkelingslanden.   
3.  Bij het verlenen van toegang aan andere Staten tot zijn exclusieve economische zone ingevolge dit artikel, houdt de kuststaat rekening met alle van belang zijnde factoren, met inbegrip van onder meer de betekenis van de levende rijkdommen van het gebied voor de economie van de betrokken kuststaat en zijn andere nationale belangen, de bepalingen van de artikelen 69 en 70, de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden in de subregio of regio aan het oogsten van een deel van het overschot en de noodzaak de economische ontwrichting in de Staten wier onderdanen gewoonlijk visten in die zone of die aanzienlijke inspanningen hebben verricht bij het onderzoek en de waarneming van visstapels tot een minimum te beperken.   
4.  Onderdanen van andere Staten die in de exclusieve economische zone vissen, dienen de beschermende maatregelen en de andere voorwaarden en bedingen vastgesteld in de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat na te leven. Deze wetten en voorschriften dienen verenigbaar te zijn met dit Verdrag en kunnen onder meer betrekking hebben op het volgende: 

a. het verlenen van een vergunning aan vissers, vissersschepen en uitrusting, met inbegrip van de betaling van rechten en tegenprestaties in andere vorm die, in het geval van kuststaten die ontwikkelingslanden zijn, kan bestaan uit toereikende compensatie op het gebied van financiering, uitrusting en technologie op het gebied van de visserij;  

b. het vaststellen van de soorten die mogen worden gevangen en het bepalen van vangstquota, met betrekking tot hetzij bepaalde visstapels of groepen visstapels, of de vangst per schip over een bepaalde termijn, hezij de vangst door onderdanen van een Staat tijdens een bepaalde periode;  

c. het regelen van visseizoenen en -gebieden, de typen, maten en hoeveelheid vistuig, en de typen, maten en aantallen vissersschepen die mogen worden gebruikt;  

d. het vaststellen van de leeftijd en de maat van vissen en andere soorten die mogen worden gevangen;  

e. het aangeven welke informatie van vissersschepen wordt verlangd, met inbegrip van statistieken inzake vangsten en visserij-inspanningen en opgaven inzake de positie van het schip;  

f. het verlangen dat, met machtiging en onder toezicht van de kuststaat, nader aangegeven programma's voor visserijonderzoek worden uitgevoerd en het regelen van het verrichten van zulk onderzoek, met inbegrip van het nemen van vangstmonsters, de bestemming van monsters en het uitbrengen van verslag over daarmede samenhangende wetenschappelijke gegevens;  

g. het plaatsen van waarnemers of leerlingen aan boord van zulke schepen door de kuststaat;  

h. het aanlanden van de gehele of van een gedeelte van de vangst door zulke schepen in de havens van de kuststaat;  

i. de voorwaarden en bedingen betreffende joint ventures of andere samenwerkingsvormen;  

j. de eisen voor de opleiding van personeel en de overdracht van visserijtechnologie, met inbegrip van de verbetering van het vermogen van de kuststaat tot het verrichten van visserijonderzoek;  

k. procedures ter afdwinging van de naleving van de gestelde eisen.     
5.  De kuststaten geven tijdig bekendheid aan wetten en voorschriften inzake bescherming en beheer.   

### Artikel  63  

####Visstapels die voorkomen binnen de exclusieve economische zones van twee of meer kuststaten of zowel binnen de exclusieve economische zone als in een gebied daarbuiten en daaraan grenzend

1.  Wanneer dezelfde visstapel of stapels van in hetzelfde ecosysteem levende soorten voorkomen binnen de exclusieve economische zones van twee of meer kuststaten, pogen deze Staten, rechtstreeks dan wel via passende subregionale of regionale organisaties, tot overeenstemming te komen omtrent de nodige maatregelen ter coördinatie en waarborging van het behoud en de ontwikkeling van zulke stapels, zulks onverlet de andere bepalingen van dit Deel.   
2.  Wanneer dezelfde visstapel of stapels van in hetzelfde ecosysteem levende soorten voorkomen in zowel de exclusieve economische zone als in een gebied buiten en grenzend aan die zone, pogen de kuststaat en de Staten die naar deze stapels in het aangrenzend gebied vissen, rechtstreeks of via passende subregionale of regionale organisaties, tot overeenstemming te komen omtrent de nodige maatregelen tot behoud van deze stapels in het aangrenzende gebied.   

### Artikel  64  

####Over zeer grote afstanden trekkende soorten

1.  De kuststaat en andere Staten wier onderdanen in de regio vissen naar de over grote afstanden trekkende soorten, opgesomd in Bijlage I werken rechtstreeks of via passende internationale organisaties samen ten einde de bescherming te waarborgen en het doel te bevorderen van een optimale benutting van zulke soorten in de gehele regio, zowel binnen als buiten de exclusieve economische zone. In regio's waarvoor geen passende internationale organisatie bestaat, werken de kuststaat en andere Staten wier onderdanen deze soorten in de regio oogsten, samen ter oprichting van zulk een organisatie en deelneming in haar werkzaamheden.   
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn van toepassing naast de andere bepalingen van dit Deel.   

### Artikel  65  

####Zeezoogdieren

Niets in dit Deel beperkt het recht van een kuststaat of de bevoegdheid van een internationale organisatie, de exploitatie van zeezoogdieren te verbieden, te beperken of strenger te regelen dan als bepaald in dit Deel. De Staten dienen samen te werken met het oog op het behoud van zeezoogdieren en wat walvisachtigen betreft in het bijzonder via de desbetreffende internationale organisaties te streven naar het behoud, het beheer en het onderzoek ervan.  

### Artikel  66  

####Anadrome soorten

1.  Staten in wier rivieren anadrome visstapels hun oorsprong hebben, hebben het meeste belang bij en verantwoordelijkheid voor zulke stapels.   
2.  De Staat van oorsprong van anadrome visstapels waarborgt het behoud ervan door de uitvaardiging van passende regulerende maatregelen voor het vissen in alle wateren aan de landzijde van de buitengrenzen van zijn exclusieve economische zone en voor het vissen bedoeld in het derde lid, letter b. De Staat van oorsprong kan, na overleg met de andere Staten, bedoeld in het derde en het vierde lid die op deze visstapels vissen, totale toelaatbare vangsten vaststellen voor in zijn rivieren hun oorsprong hebbende stapels.   
3.  

a. De visserij op anadrome stapels geschiedt alleen in wateren aan de landzijde van de buitengrenzen van exclusieve economische zones, behalve in gevallen waarin deze bepaling zou leiden tot economische ontwrichting voor een andere Staat dan de Staat van oorsprong. Ten aanzien van visserij buiten de buitengrenzen van de exclusieve economische zone onderhouden de betrokken Staten overleg ten einde overeenstemming te bereiken omtrent de voorwaarden en bedingen van zulke visserij, daarbij naar behoren rekening houdend met de eisen van bescherming en de behoeften van de Staat van oorsprong ten aanzien van deze stapels.  

b. De Staat van oorsprong werkt mede aan het tot een minimum beperken van economische ontwrichting in de andere Staten die op deze stapels vissen, rekening houdend met de normale vangst en de wijze van werken van deze Staten en alle gebieden waarin deze visserij zich heeft voorgedaan.  

c. Aan de Staten bedoeld in letter b, die bij overeenkomst met de Staat van oorsprong deelnemen aan maatregelen ter vernieuwing van anadrome visstapels, in het bijzonder door middel van bijdragen in de kosten daarvan, dient door de Staat van oorsprong bijzondere aandacht te worden geschonken bij het oogsten van in zijn rivieren hun oorsprong hebbende stapels.  

d. De afdwinging van de naleving van regelingen inzake anadrome visstapels buiten de exclusieve economische zone geschiedt bij overeenkomst tussen de Staat van oorsprong en de andere betrokken Staten.     
4.  In gevallen waarin anadrome visstapels migreren naar of door de wateren aan de landzijde van de buitengrenzen van de exclusieve economische zone van een andere Staat dan de Staat van oorsprong, werkt deze Staat met de Staat van oorsprong samen ten aanzien van het behoud en beheer van deze stapels.   
5.  De Staat van oorsprong van anadrome visstapels en andere Staten die op deze stapels vissen, treffen regelingen voorde tenuitvoerlegging van de bepalingen van dit artikel, waar passend, via regionale organisaties.   

### Artikel  67  

####Catadrome soorten

1.  Een kuststaat in wiens wateren catadrome soorten het grootste deel van hun levenscyclus doorbrengen, is verantwoordelijk voor het beheer van deze soorten en waarborgt het binnentrekken en wegtrekken van trekkende vissen.   
2.  Het oogsten van catadrome soorten geschiedt alleen in wateren aan de landzijde van de buitengrenzen van exclusieve economische zones. Wanneer het oogsten in exclusieve economische zones geschiedt, is het onderworpen aan dit artikel en aan de andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag betreffende visserij in deze zones.   
3.  In gevallen waarin al dan niet volwassen catadrome vissen trekken via de exclusieve economische zone van een andere Staat, wordt het beheer, met inbegrip van het oogsten van deze vissen, geregeld bij overeenkomst tussen de Staat bedoeld in het eerste lid en de andere betrokken Staat. Deze overeenkomst waarborgt het rationele beheer van de soorten en houdt rekening met de verantwoordelijkheden van de in het eerste lid bedoelde Staat voor de instandhouding van deze soorten.   

### Artikel  68  

####Sedentaire soorten

Dit Deel is niet van toepassing op sedentaire soorten zoals omschreven in artikel 77, vierde lid.  

### Artikel  69  

####Recht van Staten zonder zeekust

1.  Staten zonder zeekust hebben het recht, op billijke grondslag, deel te nemen aan de exploitatie van een passend deel van het overschot van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van kuststaten van dezelfde subregio of regio, met inachtneming van de van belang zijnde economische en geografische omstandigheden van alle betrokken Staten en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel en van de artikelen 61 en 62.   
2.  De voorwaarden en modaliteiten van een zodanige deelneming worden door de betrokken Staten vastgesteld door middel van bilaterale, subregionale of regionale overeenkomsten, waarbij onder meer rekening wordt gehouden met: 

a. de noodzaak gevolgen te vermijden die nadelig zijn voor vissersgemeenschappen of de visserij van de kuststaten;  

b. de mate waarin de Staat zonder zeekust, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel, ingevolge bestaande bilaterale, subregionale of regionale overeenkomsten, deelneemt aan of gerechtigd is deel te nemen aan, de exploitatie van levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van andere kuststaten;  

c. de mate waarin andere Staten zonder zeekust en Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging deelnemen aan de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zone van de kuststaat en de daaruit voortvloeiende noodzaak een bijzondere last voor één bepaalde kuststaat of deel daarvan te vermijden;  

d. de voedselbehoeften van de bevolking van de onderscheiden Staten.     
3.  Wanneer het oogstvermogen van een kuststaat een punt bereikt waarop deze in staat zou zijn de gehele toelaatbare vangst van de levende rijkdommen in zijn exclusieve economische zone te oogsten, werken de kuststaat en andere betrokken Staten samen bij de totstandkoming van billijke regelingen op bilaterale, subregionale of regionale basis om de deelneming van ontwikkelingsstaten zonder zeekust in dezelfde subregio of regio mogelijk te maken aan de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van kuststaten van de subregio of regio, als passend is gezien de omstandigheden en op voor alle partijen bevredigende voorwaarden. Bij de tenuitvoerlegging van deze bepaling dient tevens rekening te worden gehouden met de in het tweede lid genoemde factoren.   
4.  Ontwikkelde Staten zonder zeekust zijn, ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts gerechtigd deel te nemen aan de exploitatie van levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zones van ontwikkelde kuststaten van dezelfde subregio of regio, voor zover de kuststaat, bij het verlenen van toegang aan andere Staten tot de levende rijkdommen van zijn exclusieve economische zone, rekening heeft gehouden met de noodzaak nadelige gevolgen voor vissersgemeenschappen en economische ontwrichting in Staten wier onderdanen gewoonlijk in de zone vissen, tot een minimum te beperken.   
5.  De bovenstaande bepalingen laten onverlet regelingen eventueel overeengekomen in subregio's of regio's, waar de kuststaten aan Staten zonder zeekust van dezelfde subregio of regio gelijke of preferentiële rechten kunnen toekennen voor de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zones.   

### Artikel  70  

####Rechten van Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging

1.  Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging hebben het recht op billijke grondslag deel te nemen aan de exploitatie van een passend deel van het overschot van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van kuststaten in dezelfde subregio of regio, rekening houdend met de van belang zijnde economische en geografische omstandigheden van alle betrokken Staten en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel en van de artikelen 61 en 62.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit deel betekent „Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging” kuststaten, met inbegrip van Staten grenzend aan ingesloten of half-ingesloten zeeën, wier geografische ligging hen afhankelijk maakt van de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van andere Staten in de subregio of regio voor voldoende aanvoer van vis voor de voeding van hun bevolking of delen daarvan en kuststaten die geen aanspraak kunnen maken op een eigen exclusieve economische zone.   
3.  De voorwaarden en modaliteiten van een zodanige deelneming worden door de betrokken Staten vastgesteld door middel van bilaterale, subregionale of regionale overeenkomsten, waarbij onder meer rekening wordt gehouden met: 

a. de noodzaak gevolgen te vermijden die nadelig zijn voor vissersgemeenschappen of de visserij van de kuststaat;  

b. de mate waarin de Staat met een ongunstige geografische ligging, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel, ingevolge bestaande bilaterale, subregionale of regionale overeenkomsten deelneemt aan of gerechtigd is deel te nemen aan de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van andere kuststaten;  

c. de mate waarin andere Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging en Staten zonder zeekust deelnemen aan de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zone van de kuststaat en de daaruit voortvloeiende noodzaak een bijzondere last voor één bepaalde kuststaat of deel daarvan te vermijden;  

d. de voedselbehoeften van de bevolking van de onderscheiden Staten.     
4.  Wanneer het oogstvermogen van een kuststaat een punt bereikt waarop deze in staat zou zijn de gehele toelaatbare vangst van de levende rijkdommen in zijn exclusieve economische zone te oogsten, werken de kuststaat en de andere betrokken Staten samen bij de totstandkoming van billijke regelingen op bilaterale, subregionale of regionale basis om de deelneming van ontwikkelingslanden met een ongunstige geografische ligging uit dezelfde subregio of regio mogelijk te maken aan de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van de exclusieve economische zones van kuststaten van de subregio of regio, als passend is gezien de omstandigheden en op voor alle partijen bevredigende voorwaarden. Bij de tenuitvoerlegging van deze bepaling dient tevens rekening te worden gehouden met de in het derde lid genoemde factoren.   
5.  Ontwikkelde Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging zijn ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts gerechtigd deel te nemen aan de exploitatie van levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zones van ontwikkelde kuststaten van dezelfde subregio of regio, voor zover de kuststaat, bij het verlenen van toegang aan andere Staten tot de levende rijkdommen van zijn exclusieve economische zone, rekening heeft gehouden met de noodzaak nadelige gevolgen voor vissersgemeenschappen en economische ontwrichting in Staten wier onderdanen gewoonlijk in de zone vissen, tot een minimum te beperken.   
6.  De bovenstaande bepalingen laten onverlet regelingen eventueel overeengekomen in subregio's of regio's, waar de kuststaten aan Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging van dezelfde subregio of regio gelijke of preferentiële rechten kunnen toekennen voor de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zones.   

### Artikel  71  

####Niet-toepasselijkheid van de artikelen 69 en 70

De bepalingen van de artikelen 69 en 70 zijn niet van toepassing in het geval van een kuststaat wiens economie in overgrote mate afhankelijk is van de exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen van zijn exclusieve economische zone.  

### Artikel  72  

####Beperkingen op de overdracht van rechten

1.  De ingevolge de artikelen 69 en 70 bepaalde rechten tot exploitatie van de levende rijkdommen mogen niet direct of indirect worden overgedragen aan derde Staten of hun onderdanen door middel van verhuur of licentie, door het oprichten van joint ventures of op enige andere wijze die de werking van een zodanige overdracht heeft, tenzij anderszins overeengekomen door de betrokken Staten.   
2.  De voorgaande bepaling belet de betrokken Staten niet technische of financiële bijstand te verkrijgen van de Staten of internationale organisaties ten einde de uitoefening van de rechten voortvloeiend uit de artikelen 69 en 70 te vergemakkelijken, mits zulks niet de in het eerste lid bedoelde werking heeft.   

### Artikel  73  

####Afdwinging van de naleving van de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat

1.  In de uitoefening van zijn soevereine rechten de levende rijkdommen in de exclusieve economische zone te exploreren, exploiteren, behouden en te beheren, kan de kuststaat de maatregelen nemen, met inbegrip van het aan boord gaan, de inspectie, de aanhouding en het instellen van gerechtelijke procedures, die nodig kunnen zijn ter waarborging van de naleving van de door hem overeenkomstig dit Verdrag aangenomen wetten en voorschriften.   
2.  Aangehouden schepen en hun bemanning worden onverwijld in vrijheid gesteld na het verschaffen van een redelijke waarborgsom of het stellen van een andere zekerheid.   
3.  De straffen van de kuststaat voor schendingen van de wetten en voorschriften inzake de visserij in de exclusieve economische zone mogen, tenzij de betrokken Staten anders overeenkomen, niet omvatten vrijheidsbeneming of andere vormen van lichamelijke straf.   
4.  In gevallen van aanhouding of vasthouding van vreemde schepen stelt de kuststaat langs passende weg onverwijld de vlaggestaat in kennis van de genomen maatregelen en van de daarna opgelegde eventuele straffen.   

### Artikel  74  

####Afbakening van de exclusieve economische zone tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten

1.  De afbakening van de exclusieve economische zone tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten geschiedt bij overeenkomst op basis van het internationale recht, zoals bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Statuut van het Internationaal Gerechtshof, ten einde een billijke oplossing te bereiken.   
2.  Indien niet binnen een redelijke termijn een overeenkomst tot stand komt, maken de betrokken Staten gebruik van de procedures, bepaald in Deel XV.   
3.  In afwachting van de totstandkoming van een overeenkomst zoals bepaald in het eerste lid stellen de betrokken Staten in een geest van onderling begrip en samenwerking, alles in het werk om voorlopige regelingen van praktische aard aan te gaan en tijdens deze overgangsperiode de totstandkoming van een definitieve overeenkomst niet in gevaar te brengen of te belemmeren. Zodanige regelingen laten de definitieve afbakening onverlet.   
4.  Wanneer er een overeenkomst tussen de betrokken Staten van kracht is, worden vraagstukken betreffende de afbakening van de exclusieve economische zone opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van die overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  75  

####Kaarten en lijsten van geografische coördinaten

1.  Onder voorbehoud van dit Deel dienen de buitengrenslijnen van de exclusieve economische zone en de afbakeningslijnen, getrokken overeenkomstig artikel 74, te worden aangegeven op kaarten van een schaal of schalen groot genoeg om de positie ervan te kunnen vaststellen. Waar passend kunnen deze buitengrenslijnen of afbakeningslijnen worden vervangen door lijsten van geografische coördinaten van punten, met opgave van het geodetisch reductievlak.   
2.  De kuststaat geeft voldoende bekendheid aan zodanige kaarten of lijsten van geografische coördinaten en legt een exemplaar van elke kaart of lijst neder bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### DEEL  VI  

####CONTINENTAAL PLAT

### Artikel  76  

####Begripsomschrijving van het continentale plat

1.  Het continentale plat van een kuststaat omvat de zeebodem en de ondergrond van de onder water gelegen gebieden die zich buiten zijn territoriale zee uitstrekken door de natuurlijke voortzetting van zijn landterritorium tot de buitenste grens van de continentale rand, of tot een afstand van 200 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten wanneer de buitenste grens van de continentale rand zich niet tot die afstand uitstrekt.   
2.  Het continentale plat van een kuststaat strekt zich niet verder uit dan de grenzen bepaald in het vierde tot en met het zesde lid.   
3.  De continentale rand omvat de onder water gelegen voortzetting van de landmassa van de kuststaat en bestaat uit de zeebodem en ondergrond van het plat, de helling en de voet. Deze rand omvat niet de diepe oceaanbodem met de oceaanruggen of de ondergrond daarvan.   
4.  

a. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag stelt de kuststaat de buitenste grens van de continentale rand vast wanneer deze zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten door: 

(i) een lijn, getrokken overeenkomstig het zevende lid, uitgaande van de uiterste vaste punten bij elk waarvan de dikte van de sedimentaire rotsen ten minste 1 procent is van de kortste afstand van een zodanig punt tot de voet van de continentale helling; of  

(ii) een lijn, getrokken overeenkomstig het zevende lid, uitgaande van vaste punten niet verder dan 60 zeemijl van de voet van de continentale helling.    

b. Bij gebreke van bewijs van het tegendeel wordt de voet van de continentale helling bepaald als het punt van de maximale verandering van de hellingshoek aan zijn basis.     
5.  De vaste punten die de lijn bepalen van de buitengrenzen van het continentale plat op de zeebodem, getrokken overeenkomstig het vierde lid, letter a onder (i) en (ii) mogen ofwel niet verder liggen dan 350 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten ofwel niet verder liggen dan 100 zeemijl van de 2500-meter-isobath, die de lijn is welke de diepten van 2500 meter verbindt.   
6.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het vijfde lid mag op onderzeese ruggen de buitengrens van het continentale plat niet meer belopen dan 350 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten. Dit lid is niet van toepassing op onderzeese bodemverheffingen die natuurlijke onderdelen van de continentale rand zijn, zoals de hoogvlakten, opgaande hellingen, drempels, banken en uitsteeksels.   
7.  De kuststaat legt de buitengrenzen van zijn continentale plat vast, waar dat plat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl van de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten, door rechte lijnen van niet langer dan 60 zeemijl lengte, die vaste punten verbinden, omschreven door breedte- en lengtecoördinaten.   
8.  Gegevens omtrent de grenzen van het continentale plat dat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl vanaf de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten, dienen door de kuststaat te worden voorgelegd aan de Commissie inzake de grenzen van het continentale plat, in het leven geroepen ingevolge Bijlage II op basis van een billijke geografische vertegenwoordiging. De Commissie doet de kuststaten aanbevelingen inzake aangelegenheden betreffende de vaststelling van de buitengrenzen van hun continentale plat. De grenzen van het plat, door de kuststaat vastgesteld op basis van deze aanbevelingen, zijn definitief en bindend.   
9.  De kuststaat legt bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties kaarten en van belang zijnde informatie, met inbegrip van geodetische gegevens, neder, door middel waarvan de buitengrenzen van het continentale plat duurzaam worden beschreven. De Secretaris-Generaal geeft hieraan naar behoren bekendheid.   
10.  De bepalingen van dit artikel laten onverlet de kwestie van de afbakening van het continentale plat tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten.   

### Artikel  77  

####Rechten van de kuststaat op het continentale plat

1.  De kuststaat oefent over het continentale plat soevereine rechten uit ter exploratie en exploitatie van de natuurlijke rijkdommen van het plat.   
2.  De in het eerste lid bedoelde rechten zijn exclusief in die zin dat, indien de kuststaat het continentale plat niet exploreert of de natuurlijke rijkdommen ervan niet exploiteert, niemand deze werkzaamheden mag gaan verrichten dan met de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de kuststaat.   
3.  De rechten van de kuststaat op het continentale plat zijn niet afhankelijk van een daadwerkelijke of fictieve bezetting of van enige uitdrukkelijke proclamatie.   
4.  De in dit Deel bedoelde natuurlijke rijkdommen bestaan uit de minerale en andere niet-levende rijkdommen van de zeebodem en de ondergrond, alsmede uit levende organismen die tot de sedentaire soorten behoren, dat wil zeggen organismen die ten tijde dat ze geoogst kunnen worden, hetzij zich onbeweeglijk op of onder de zeebodem bevinden, hetzij zich niet kunnen verplaatsen dan in voortdurend fysiek contact met de zeebodem of de ondergrond.   

### Artikel  78  

####Juridische status van de bovengelegen wateren en het luchtruim boven die wateren en de rechten en vrijheden van andere Staten

1.  De rechten van de kuststaat op het continentale plat doen geen afbreuk aan de juridische status van de bovengelegen wateren of van het luchtruim boven die wateren.   
2.  De uitoefening van de rechten van de kuststaat over het continentale plat mag geen inbreuk maken op of leiden tot ongerechtvaardigde belemmering van de scheepvaart en andere rechten en vrijheden van andere Staten, zoals bepaald in dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  79  

####Onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen op het continentale plat

1.  Alle Staten zijn gerechtigd onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen op het continentale plat te leggen, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van zijn recht redelijke maatregelen te nemen voor de exploratie van het continentale plat en de exploitatie van de natuurlijke rijkdommen daarvan en het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van verontreiniging door pijpleidingen, mag de kuststaat het leggen of het onderhoud van onderzeese kabels of pijpleidingen niet belemmeren.   
3.  Het tracé van de pijpleidingen die op het continentale plat worden gelegd, is onderworpen aan de toestemming van de kuststaat.   
4.  Niets in dit Deel doet afbreuk aan het recht van de kuststaat voorwaarden te stellen voor kabels of pijpleidingen die zijn gebied of territoriale zee binnenkomen, of aan zijn rechtsmacht over kabels en pijpleidingen, aangelegd of gebruikt in verband met de exploratie van zijn continentale plat of de exploitatie van de rijkdommen daarvan of de werkzaamheden van kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen die zich onder zijn rechtsmacht bevinden.   
5.  Bij het leggen van onderzeese kabels of pijpleidingen houden de Staten naar behoren rekening met reeds aanwezige kabels of pijpleidingen. Inzonderheid dienen de mogelijkheden voor het herstellen van bestaande kabels en pijpleidingen niet te worden aangetast.   

### Artikel  80  

####Kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen op het continentale plat

Artikel 60 is mutatis mutandis van toepassing op kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen op het continentale plat.  

### Artikel  81  

####Boren op het continentale plat

De kuststaat bezit het exclusieve recht machtiging te verlenen tot het boren op het continentale plat voor alle doeleinden en hiervoor regels te stellen.  

### Artikel  82  

####Betalingen en bijdragen met betrekking tot de exploitatie van het continentale plat dat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl

1.  De kuststaat verricht betalingen of levert bijdragen in natura met betrekking tot de exploitatie van de niet-levende rijkdommen van het continentale plat dat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl vanaf de basislijnen vanwaar de breedte van de territoriale zee wordt gemeten.   
2.  De betalingen en bijdragen geschieden jaarlijks met betrekking tot de totale produktie op een plaats na de eerste vijf jaar van produktie op die plaats. Voor het zesde jaar is de hoogte van de betaling of bijdrage 1 procent van de waarde of de omvang van de produktie op die plaats. De hoogte stijgt met 1 procent voor elk volgend jaar tot het twaalfde jaar en blijft daarna op 7 procent. De produktie omvat niet de natuurlijke rijkdommen gebruikt in verband met de exploitatie.   
3.  Een ontwikkelingsstaat die netto-importeur is van een minerale rijkdom die wordt gewonnen uit zijn continentale plat, is vrijgesteld van het verrichten van zulke betalingen of het leveren van zulke bijdragen met betrekking tot die minerale hulpbron.   
4.  De betalingen worden verricht of de bijdragen worden geleverd via de Autoriteit, die deze zal verdelen onder de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, op basis van billijke verdelingscriteria, met inachtneming van de belangen en behoeften van de ontwikkelingsstaten, vooral de minst ontwikkelde onder hen, alsmede van de Staten zonder zeekust.   

### Artikel  83  

####Afbakening van het continentale plat tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten

1.  De afbakening van het continentale plat tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten geschiedt bij overeenkomst op basis van het internationaal recht, zoals bedoeld in artikel 38 van het Statuut van het Internationaal Gerechtshof ten einde een billijke oplossing te bereiken.   
2.  Indien niet binnen een redelijke termijn een overeenkomst tot stand komt, maken de betrokken Staten gebruik van de procedures bepaald in deel XV.   
3.  In afwachting van de totstandkoming van een overeenkomst zoals bepaald in het eerste lid stellen de betrokken Staten in een geest van wederzijds begrip en samenwerking, alles in het werk om voorlopige overeenkomsten van praktische aard aan te gaan en tijdens deze overgangsperiode de totstandkoming van een definitieve overeenkomst niet te verstoren of te belemmeren. Zodanige regelingen laten de definitieve afbakening onverlet.   
4.  Wanneer er een overeenkomst tussen de betrokken Staten van kracht is, worden vraagstukken betreffende de afbakening van het continentale plat opgelost overeenkomstig de bepalingen van die overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  84  

####Kaarten en lijsten van geografische coördinaten

1.  Onder voorbehoud van dit Deel dienen de buitengrenslijnen van het continentale plat en de afbakeningslijnen, getrokken overeenkomstig artikel 83, te worden aangegeven op kaarten van een schaal of schalen groot genoeg om hun positie te kunnen vaststellen. Waar passend kunnen deze buitengrenslijnen of afbakeningslijnen worden vervangen door lijsten van geografische coördinaten van punten, met opgave van het geodetisch reductievlak.   
2.  De kuststaat geeft voldoende bekendheid aan zodanige kaarten of lijsten van geografische coördinaten en legt een exemplaar van elke kaart of lijst neder bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en, in het geval daarop de buitengrenslijnen van het continentale plat staan aangegeven, bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Autoriteit.   

### Artikel  85  

####Het aanleggen van tunnels

Dit Deel doet geen afbreuk aan het recht van de kuststaat de ondergrond te exploiteren door middel van het aanleggen van tunnels, ongeacht de diepte van het water boven de ondergrond.  

### DEEL  VII  

####VOLLE ZEE

### AFDELING  1

### Artikel  90  

####Recht van scheepvaart

Iedere Staat, ongeacht of deze een kuststaat of Staat zonder zeekust is, heeft het recht schepen onder zijn eigen vlag op de volle zee te doen varen.  

### Artikel  91  

####Nationaliteit van schepen

1.  Iedere Staat stelt de voorwaarden vast voor het verlenen van zijn nationaliteit aan schepen, voor de registratie van schepen op zijn grondgebied en voor het recht zijn vlag te voeren. Een schip heeft de nationaliteit van de Staat wiens vlag het gerechtigd is te voeren. Er moet een wezenlijke band bestaan tussen de Staat en het schip.   
2.  Iedere Staat dient aan schepen aan wie hij het recht heeft verleend zijn vlag te voeren, documenten te verstrekken waaruit zulks blijkt.   

### Artikel  92  

####Status van schepen

1.  Een schip mag slechts onder de vlag van één Staat varen en is, behalve in bijzondere gevallen waarin uitdrukkelijk is voorzien in internationale verdragen of in dit Verdrag, op volle zee onderworpen aan de uitsluitende rechtsmacht van die Staat. Een schip mag gedurende een reis of tijdens het verblijf in een aanloophaven niet van vlag veranderen, behalve in het geval van een werkelijke overdracht van de eigendom of een wijziging in de registratie.   
2.  Een schip dat vaart onder de vlag van twee of meer Staten en dat naar omstandigheden de ene of de andere vlag gebruikt, kan zich tegenover een derde Staat op de nationaliteit van geen van deze Staten beroepen en kan worden gelijkgesteld met een schip zonder nationaliteit.   

### Artikel  93  

####Schepen die de vlag voeren van de Verenigde Naties, hun gespecialiseerde organisaties of van de Internationale Organisatie voor Atoomenergie

De voorgaande artikelen laten onverlet de kwestie van schepen in officiële dienst van de Verenigde Naties, hun gespecialiseerde organisaties of van de Internationale Organisatie voor Atoomenergie en die de vlag van de Verenigde Naties voeren.  

### Artikel  94  

####Plichten van de vlaggestaat

1.  Iedere Staat oefent doeltreffend zijn rechtsmacht en toezicht in administratieve, technische en sociale aangelegenheden uit over schepen die zijn vlag voeren.   
2.  Inzonderheid dient iedere Staat: 

a. een register bij te houden van schepen, dat de namen en bijzonderheden bevat van schepen die zijn vlag voeren, behalve van die welke van de algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften zijn uitgesloten op grond van hun geringe grootte; en  

b. ingevolge zijn binnenlandse wetgeving rechtsmacht op zich te nemen over elk schip dat zijn vlag voert en over de kapitein, officieren en bemanning daarvan met betrekking tot administratieve, technische en sociale aangelegenheden betreffende het schip.     
3.  Iedere Staat neemt ten aanzien van de schepen die zijn vlag voeren alle maatregelen die nodig zijn om de veiligheid op zee te verzekeren, onder andere met betrekking tot: 

a. de bouw, uitrusting en zeewaardigheid der schepen;  

b. het bemannen der schepen en de arbeidsvoorwaarden voor en de opleiding van de bemanning, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de van toepassing zijnde internationale verdragen;  

c. het gebruik van signalen, het onderhouden van verbindingen en het voorkomen van aanvaringen.     
4.  Deze maatregelen omvatten die welke nodig zijn om te verzekeren: 

a. dat elk schip, voorafgaand aan de registratie en daarna met passende tussenpozen, wordt onderworpen aan een onderzoek door een bevoegde deskundige en dat het de kaarten, nautische publikaties en navigatie-uitrusting en instrumenten aan boord heeft die vereist zijn voor de veilige vaart van het schip;  

b. dat elk schip onder het bevel staat van een kapitein en officieren die de juiste bekwaamheden bezitten, inzonderheid op het gebied van zeemanschap, navigatie, verbindingen en scheepswerktuigkunde, en dat de bemanning wat bekwaamheden en aantal betreft, passend is voor het type, de grootte, de machines en uitrusting van het schip;  

c. dat de kapitein, de officieren, en voor zover passend, de bemanning volledig bekend zijn met en dat van hen de naleving wordt geëist van de van toepassing zijnde internationale voorschriften voor de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, de voorkoming van aanvaringen, het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van verontreiniging van de zee en het onderhouden van radioverbindingen.     
5.  Bij het nemen van de in het derde en het vierde lid vereiste maatregelen dient iedere Staat zich te houden aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale voorschriften, procedures en praktijken en alle stappen te ondernemen die nodig zijn om de naleving daarvan te verzekeren.   
6.  Een Staat die ernstige redenen heeft aan te nemen dat de passende rechtsmacht en het passend toezicht ten aanzien van een schip niet zijn uitgeoefend, kan de feiten rapporteren aan de vlaggestaat. Bij ontvangst van zulk een rapport onderzoekt de vlaggestaat de aangelegenheid en neemt hij, wanneer dienstig, alle nodige maatregelen om de situatie te corrigeren.   
7.  Iedere Staat dient een onderzoek te laten instellen door of ten overstaan van een naar behoren bevoegd persoon of bevoegde personen naar elk ongeval op zee of voorval verband houdend met de navigatie in volle zee, waarbij een schip dat zijn vlag voert, is betrokken en dat verlies aan mensenlevens of ernstig letsel aan onderdanen van een andere Staat of ernstige schade aan schepen of installaties van een andere Staat of aan het mariene milieu heeft veroorzaakt. De vlaggestaat en de andere Staat werken samen bij het leiden van een door die andere Staat gehouden onderzoek naar zulk een ongeval op zee of voorval verband houdend met de navigatie.   

### Artikel  95  

####Immuniteit van oorlogsschepen in volle zee

Oorlogsschepen in volle zee genieten volledige immuniteit van de rechtsmacht van iedere Staat die niet de vlaggestaat is.  

### Artikel  96  

####Immuniteit van slechts voor niet-commerciële overheidsdoeleinden gebruikte schepen

Schepen die het eigendom zijn van of geëxploiteerd worden door een Staat en door die Staat slechts voor niet-commerciële overheidsdoeleinden worden gebruikt, genieten in volle zee volledige immuniteit van de rechtsmacht van iedere Staat die niet de vlaggestaat is.  

### Artikel  97  

####Rechtsmacht in strafrechtelijke aangelegenheden in geval van aanvaring of een ander voorval verband houdend met de navigatie

1.  In geval van een aanvaring of een ander voorval verband houdend met de navigatie van een schip in volle zee, waarvoor de kapitein of enige andere persoon in dienst van het schip strafrechtelijk of tuchtrechtelijk verantwoordelijk kan worden gesteld, kan tegen een dergelijke persoon een strafvervolging of tuchtrechtelijke vervolging slechts worden ingesteld voor de rechterlijke of bestuurlijke autoriteiten van de vlaggestaat of van de Staat waarvan een dergelijke persoon onderdaan is.   
2.  De Staat die een gezagvoerdersdiploma of ander diploma heeft uitgereikt is, in tuchtrechtelijke gevallen, bij uitsluiting bevoegd om, na een behoorlijke door het recht omschreven procedure, zulke diploma's in te trekken, ook indien de houder geen onderdaan van die Staat is.   
3.  Het aanhouden of vasthouden van een schip mag, zelfs voor maatregelen van onderzoek, alleen gelast worden door de autoriteiten van de vlaggestaat.   

### Artikel  98  

####Plicht hulp te verlenen

1.  Iedere Staat dient de kapitein van een schip dat zijn vlag voert ertoe te verplichten dat hij, voor zover hij zulks kan doen zonder ernstig gevaar voor het schip, de bemanning of de passagiers: 

a. hulp verleent aan een ieder die hij op zee in levensgevaar aantreft;  

b. met de grootst mogelijke spoed personen die in nood verkeren te hulp komt, indien hem is medegedeeld dat zij hulp behoeven, voor zover een dergelijke handelwijze redelijkerwijze van hem verwacht kan worden;  

c. na een aanvaring hulp verleent aan het andere schip, zijn bemanning en passagiers en, indien mogelijk, het andere schip de naam van zijn eigen schip, de haven waar het is geregistreerd en de dichtsbijzijnde haven waar het zal aanlopen, mededeelt.     
2.  Iedere kuststaat bevordert de oprichting, het functioneren en het onderhoud van een voor zijn taak berekende en doeltreffende opsporings- en reddingsdienst ten behoeve van de veiligheid op en boven de zee en dient, waar de omstandigheden zulks nodig maken, hiertoe met zijn buurstaten regionale overeenkomsten voor wederzijdse samenwerking te sluiten.   

### Artikel  99  

####Verbod van het vervoer van slaven

ledere Staat neemt doeltreffende maatregelen om het vervoer van slaven in schepen die zijn vlag mogen voeren, te verhinderen en te bestraffen, alsmede om onrechtmatig gebruik van zijn vlag voor dat doel te verhinderen. Iedere slaaf die op enig schip, ongeacht de vlag die het voert, zijn toevlucht zoekt, krijgt door dit enkele feit zijn vrijheid.  

### Artikel  100  

####Plicht samen te werken ter onderdrukking van piraterij

Alle Staten werken zo nauw mogelijk samen ter onderdrukking van piraterij op volle zee of op andere plaatsen die buiten de rechtsmacht van enige Staat vallen.  

### Artikel  101  

####Begripsomschrijving van piraterij

Piraterij is een der hiernavolgende handelingen: 

a. iedere onwettige daad van geweld of aanhouding, alsmede iedere daad van plundering die door de bemanning of de passagiers van een particulier schip of een particulier luchtvaartuig voor persoonlijke doeleinden wordt gepleegd en die is gericht: 

(i) in volle zee, tegen een ander schip of luchtvaartuig of tegen personen of eigendommen aan boord van een zodanig schip of luchtvaartuig;  

(ii) tegen een schip, een luchtvaartuig, personen of eigendommen op een plaats die buiten de rechtsmacht van enige staat valt;    

b. iedere vrijwillige deelneming aan de exploitatie van een schip of luchtvaartuig met kennis van de feiten die het schip of luchtvaartuig tot piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig maken;  

c. iedere opruiing tot of opzettelijke vergemakkelijking van een in letter a of b omschreven handeling.    

### Artikel  102  

####Piraterij dooreen oorlogsschip, staatsschip of staatsluchtvaartuig waarvan de bemanning heeft gemuit

De daden van piraterij als omschreven in artikel 101, bedreven door een oorlogsschip, staatsschip of staatsluchtvaartuig waarvan de bemanning heeft gemuit en het beheer van het schip of luchtvaartuig heeft overgenomen, worden gelijkgesteld met daden bedreven door een particulier schip of luchtvaartuig.  

### Artikel  103  

####Begripsomschrijving van een piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig

Een schip of luchtvaartuig wordt als piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig beschouwd als het door de personen die de daadwerkelijke macht over het schip of het luchtvaartuig uitoefenen, bestemd is om te worden gebruikt voor het bedrijven van een van de in artikel 101 genoemde handelingen. Hetzelfde geldt voor een schip of luchtvaartuig dat gebruikt is voor het plegen van een dergelijke handeling, zolang het in de macht blijft van de personen die zich aan die handeling hebben schuldig gemaakt.  

### Artikel  104  

####Behoud of verlies van de nationaliteit van een piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig

Een schip of luchtvaartuig kan zijn nationaliteit behouden ondanks het feit dat het een piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig is geworden. Het behoud of het verlies van de nationaliteit wordt bepaald door de wet van de Staat die deze nationaliteit heeft toegekend.  

### Artikel  105  

####Inbeslagneming van een piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig

In volle zee of op andere plaatsen die buiten de rechtsmacht van enige Staat zijn gelegen, mag iedere Staat een piratenschip of piratenluchtvaartuig of een schip of luchtvaartuig dat door piraten onderscheidenlijk kapers is overmeesterd en zich in hun macht bevindt, in beslag nemen, de personen aan boord arresteren en de goederen aan boord in beslag nemen. De gerechten van de Staat die de inbeslagneming heeft uitgevoerd, kunnen beslissen over de op te leggen straffen en kunnen tevens besluiten hoe gehandeld zal worden met de schepen, luchtvaartuigen of eigendommen, met inachtneming van de rechten van derden te goeder trouw.  

### Artikel  106  

####Aansprakelijkheid voor inbeslagneming zonder voldoende grond

Indien een schip of luchtvaartuig zonder voldoende grond in beslag is genomen wegens verdenking van piraterij, is de Staat die de inbeslagneming heeft verricht, tegenover de Staat wiens nationaliteit het schip of luchtvaartuig bezit, aansprakelijk voor ieder verlies of iedere schade die ten gevolge van de inbeslagneming is ontstaan.  

### Artikel  107  

####Schepen en luchtvaartuigen die gerechtigd zijn tot inbeslagneming wegens piraterij

Inbeslagneming wegens piraterij mag alleen geschieden door oorlogsschepen of militaire luchtvaartuigen, of andere schepen of luchtvaartuigen met kentekens waaruit duidelijk blijkt dat zij in dienst zijn van de Staat en die daartoe gemachtigd zijn.  

### Artikel  108  

####Smokkel in verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen

1.  Alle Staten werken samen bij de onderdrukking van de smokkel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, waarmede schepen in volle zee zich bezig houden in strijd met internationale verdragen.   
2.  Een Staat die redelijke gronden heeft aan te nemen dat een schip dat zijn vlag voert, zich bezighoudt met smokkel in verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen, kan verzoeken om de medewerking van andere Staten ter onderdrukking van zodanige smokkel.   

### Artikel  109  

####Uitzendingen vanaf de volle zee waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend

1.  Alle Staten werken samen bij de onderdrukking van uitzendingen vanaf de volle zee waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag betekent „uitzendingen waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend” het overbrengen van radio- of televisie-uitzendingen vanaf een schip of installatie in volle zee, bedoeld voor ontvangst door het publiek, in strijd met de internationale voorschriften, evenwel met uitzondering van noodseinen.   
3.  Personen die zich bezighouden met uitzendingen waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend, kunnen worden vervolgd voor het gerecht van: 

a. de vlaggestaat van het schip;  

b. de Staat van registratie van de installatie;  

c. de Staat waarvan de persoon onderdaan is;  

d. iedere Staat waar de uitzendingen kunnen worden ontvangen; of  

e. iedere Staat waar de radioverbindingen waarvoor machtiging is verleend, erdoor worden gestoord.     
4.  In volle zee kan een Staat die rechtsmacht bezit overeenkomstig het derde lid, in overeenstemming met artikel 110 alle personen of schepen aanhouden die zich bezighouden met uitzendingen waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend, en de uitzendapparatuur in beslag nemen.   

### Artikel  110  

####Recht van onderzoek

1.  Behalve in gevallen waarin zulks is toegestaan uit hoofde van aan verdragen ontleende bevoegdheden is een oorlogsschip dat in volle zee een vreemd schip aantreft, dat geen schip is dat overeenkomstig de artikelen 95 en 96 recht heeft op volledige immuniteit, niet gerechtigd het aan te houden, tenzij er gegronde reden bestaat aan te nemen: 

a. dat het schip zich bezighoudt met piraterij;  

b. dat het schip zich bezighoudt met slavenhandel;  

c. dat het schip zich bezighoudt met uitzendingen waarvoor geen machtiging is verleend en de vlaggestaat van het oorlogsschip ingevolge artikel 109 rechtsmacht bezit;  

d. dat het schip geen nationaliteit heeft; of  

e. dat het schip, hoewel het een vreemde vlag voert of weigert zijn vlag te tonen, in werkelijkheid van dezelfde nationaliteit is als het oorlogsschip.     
2.  In de gevallen bedoeld in het eerste lid kan het oorlogsschip overgaan tot een onderzoek naar het recht van het schip tot het voeren van zijn vlag. Te dien einde kan het een boot naar het verdachte schip zenden onder bevel van een officier. Indien er na het onderzoek van de scheepspapïeren verdenking blijft bestaan, kan het overgaan tot een nader onderzoek aan boord van het schip, welk onderzoek dient te geschieden zonder onnodige overlast te veroorzaken.   
3.  Indien de verdenkingen ongegrond blijken te zijn en indien het aangehouden schip niets heeft gedaan om die verdenkingen te rechtvaardigen, wordt het schadeloos gesteld voor ieder verlies of iedere schade daardoor eventueel geleden.   
4.  Deze bepalingen zijn *mutatis mutandis* van toepassing op militaire luchtvaartuigen.   
5.  Deze bepalingen zijn eveneens van toepassing op andere naar behoren gemachtigde schepen of luchtvaartuigen met kentekens waaruit duidelijk blijkt dat zij in gebruik zijn bij de Staat.   

### Artikel  111  

####Achtervolgingsrecht

1.  Een vreemd schip kan worden achtervolgd als de bevoegde autoriteiten van de kuststaat goede redenen hebben aan te nemen, dat het schip de wetten en voorschriften van die Staat heeft overtreden. Een dergelijke achtervolging dient aan te vangen wanneer het vreemde schip of een van zijn boten zich binnen de binnenwateren, de archipelwateren, de territoriale zee of de aansluitende zone van de achtervolgende Staat bevindt en mag alleen buiten de territoriale zee of de aansluitende zone worden voortgezet, indien de achtervolging niet is onderbroken. Het is niet noodzakelijk dat, op het ogenblik waarop het vreemde schip binnen de territoriale zee of de aansluitende zone bevel krijgt te stoppen, het schip dat het bevel geeft zich eveneens binnen de territoriale zee of de aansluitende zone bevindt. Indien het vreemde schip zich bevindt binnen een aansluitende zone als omschreven in artikel 33, mag slechts tot achtervolging worden overgegaan, indien er een inbreuk heeft plaats gehad op de rechten voor welker bescherming de zone is ingesteld.   
2.  Het recht van achtervolging is *mutatis mutandis* van toepassing op overtredingen in de exclusieve economische zone of op het continentale plat, met inbegrip van de veiligheidszones rond installaties op het continentale plat, van de wetten en voorschriften van de kuststaat die overeenkomstig dit Verdrag van toepassing zijn op de exclusieve economische zone of het continentale plat, met inbegrip van zulke veiligheidszones.   
3.  Het achtervolgingsrecht houdt op zodra het achtervolgde schip de territoriale zee van zijn eigen land of van een derde Staat bereikt.   
4.  De achtervolging wordt niet geacht te zijn begonnen voordat het achtervolgende schip zich er met behulp van de ter beschikking staande bruikbare middelen van overtuigd heeft, dat het achtervolgde schip of een van zijn boten of andere schepen die in één verband werken en het achtervolgde schip als moederschip gebruiken zich bevinden binnen de territoriale zee, onderscheidenlijk de aansluitende zone of de exclusieve economische zone of boven het continentale plat. De achtervolging mag slechts worden begonnen nadat een zichtbaar of hoorbaar signaal tot stoppen is gegeven op een afstand die het voor het vreemde schip mogelijk maakt het signaal te zien of te horen.   
5.  Het achtervolgingsrecht mag alleen worden uitgeoefend door oorlogsschepen of militaire luchtvaartuigen of andere schepen of luchtvaartuigen met kentekens waaruit duidelijk blijkt dat zij in dienst zijn van de Staat en die daartoe gemachtigd zijn.   
6.  Indien de achtervolging wordt verricht door een luchtvaartuig: 

a. zijn de bepalingen van het eerste tot en met het vierde lid *mutatis mutandis* van toepassing;  

b. moet het luchtvaartuig dat het bevel tot stoppen geeft zelf het schip daadwerkelijk achtervolgen tot het ogenblik waarop een schip of luchtvaartuig van de kuststaat, dat door het luchtvaartuig is opgeroepen, ter plaatse verschijnt om de achtervolging over te nemen, tenzij het luchtvaartuig zelf in staat is het schip aan te houden. Het is geen voldoende rechtvaardiging voor een aanhouding buiten de territoriale zee dat het schip slechts door het luchtvaartuig is ontdekt als overtreder of als verdacht van een overtreding, indien het niet bevel heeft gekregen te stoppen, alsmede is achtervolgd door het luchtvaartuig zelf of door andere luchtvaartuigen of schepen die de achtervolging ononderbroken voortzetten.     
7.  Het vrijgeven van een schip dat binnen de rechtsmacht van een Staat is aangehouden en dat naar een haven van die Staat is geëscorteerd met de bedoeling dat daar een onderzoek zal worden ingesteld door de bevoegde autoriteiten, kan niet worden geëist alleen op grond van het feit dat het schip, tijdens zijn reis, door een deel van de exclusieve economische zone of over een deel van de volle zee geëscorteerd werd, indien de omstandigheden zulks noodzakelijk maakten.   
8.  Indien een schip buiten de territoriale zee tot stoppen is gedwongen of aangehouden onder omstandigheden die de uitoefening van het achtervolgingsrecht niet rechtvaardigen, dient het schip voor ieder verlies of iedere schade daardoor eventueel geleden, schadeloos te worden gesteld.   

### Artikel  112  

####Recht tot het leggen van onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen

1.  Alle Staten hebben het recht onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen te leggen op de bodem van de volle zee buiten het continentale plat.   
2.  Artikel 79, vijfde lid, is op zulke kabels en pijpleidingen van toepassing.   

### Artikel  113  

####Breuk of beschadiging van een onderzeese kabel of pijpleiding

Iedere Staat neemt de wetten en voorschriften aan nodig om te bepalen dat strafbaar is het opzettelijk of ten gevolge van grove onachtzaamheid breken of beschadigen van een onderzeese kabel in volle zee door een schip dat zijn vlag voert, of door een persoon die is onderworpen aan zijn rechtsmacht, op een zodanige wijze, dat daardoor de telegraafof telefoonverbindingen kunnen worden onderbroken of bemoeilijkt, alsmede het breken of beschadigen van een onderzeese pijpleiding of een sterkstroomkabel. Deze bepaling is ook van toepassing op gedrag opzettelijk gericht op of vermoedelijk leidend tot een dergelijke breuk of beschadiging. Deze bepaling is evenwel niet van toepassing op een breuk of beschadiging veroorzaakt door personen die slechts handelen met het gerechtvaardigde doel hun leven of hun schip te redden, nadat zij alle noodzakelijke voorzorgen hadden genomen om een dergelijke breuk of beschadiging te vermijden.  

### Artikel  114  

####Breuk of beschadiging door eigenaars van een onderzeese kabel of pijpleiding van een andere onderzeese kabel of pijpleiding

Iedere Staat neemt de wetten en voorschriften aan nodig om te bepalen dat, indien aan zijn rechtsmacht onderworpen personen die eigenaar zijn van een kabel of een pijpleiding in volle zee, bij het leggen of herstellen van die kabel of pijpleiding een breuk in of schade aan een andere kabel of pijpleiding veroorzaken, deze personen de kosten van het herstel moeten betalen.  

### Artikel  115  

####Schadeloosstelling voor verlies, geleden bij het voorkomen van schade aan een onderzeese kabel of pijpleiding

Iedere Staat neemt de wetten en voorschriften aan nodig om te verzekeren, dat eigenaars van schepen die kunnen bewijzen dat zij een anker, net of ander vistuig hebben opgeofferd ten einde beschadiging van een onderzeese kabel of pijpleiding te voorkomen, schadeloos zullen worden gesteld door de eigenaar van de kabel of pijpleiding, onder voorwaarde dat de eigenaar van het schip van te voren alle redelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen heeft genomen.  

### AFDELING  2  

####BEHOUD EN BEHEER VAN DE LEVENDE RIJKDOMMEN VAN DE VOLLE ZEE

a. Onverminderd de doelen, vervat in artikel 150 en ten behoeve van de tenuitvoerlegging van het bepaalde in letter h van dat artikel, neemt de Autoriteit, optredend via bestaande instanties dan wel via de nieuwe regelingen of overeenkomsten die passend kunnen zijn, en waaraan alle belanghebbende partijen, met inbegrip van zowel producenten als verbruikers, deelnemen, de maatregelen die nodig zijn voor de bevordering van de groei, de doelmatigheid en de stabiliteit van markten voor de basisprodukten, vervaardigd uit de in het Gebied gewonnen delfstoffen, tegen prijzen die lonend zijn voor de producenten en billijk voor de gebruikers. Alle Staten die Partij zijn werken hiertoe samen.  

b. De Autoriteit heeft het recht deel te nemen aan alle conferenties die zich bezighouden met deze basisprodukten en waaraan alle belanghebbende partijen, met inbegrip van zowel producenten als gebruikers, deelnemen. De Autoriteit heeft het recht partij te worden bij een regeling of overeenkomst die uit zulke conferenties voortvloeit. Deelneming van de Autoriteit aan ingevolge deze regelingen of overeenkomsten ingestelde organen, dient betrekking te hebben op de produktie in het Gebied en overeenkomstig de desbetreffende regels van die organen te zijn.  

c. De Autoriteit voldoet aan haar verplichtingen ingevolge de in dit lid bedoelde regelingen of overeenkomsten op een wijze die een eenvormige en non-discriminatoire toepassing verzekert ten aanzien van alle produktie van de desbetreffende delfstoffen in het Gebied. Hierbij handelt de Autoriteit op een wijze die verenigbaar is met de voorwaarden van bestaande contracten en goedgekeurde werkplannen van de Onderneming.     
2.  

a. Tijdens de in het derde lid aangegeven overgangsperiode wordt geen commerciële produktie ondernomen op grond van een goedgekeurd werkplan, totdat de exploitant bij de Autoriteit een produktievergunning heeft aangevraagd en deze is verleend. Zodanige produktievergunningen mogen niet worden aangevraagd of verleend meer dan vijf jaar vóór de voorgenomen aanvang van de commerciële produktie ingevolge het werkplan, tenzij de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit een andere termijn voorschrijven gezien de aard en het tijdschema van de uitvoering van het project.  

b. In de aanvrage voor de produktievergunning geeft de exploitant de verwachte jaarlijkse hoeveelheid nikkel aan die ingevolge het goedgekeurde werkplan zal worden gewonnen. De aanvrage omvat een overzicht van de door de exploitant te maken kosten nadat hij de vergunning heeft ontvangen, welke redelijkerwijze zijn berekend, om hem in staat te stellen op de voorgenomen datum een begin te maken met de commerciële produktie.  

c. Voor de toepassing van het bepaalde in de letters a en b stelt de Autoriteit passende prestatienormen vast overeenkomstig Bijlage III, artikel 17.  

d. De Autoriteit verleent een produktievergunning voor het aangevraagde produktieniveau, tenzij het totaal van dat niveau en van de niveaus waarvoor reeds een vergunning werd verleend, hoger is dan het produktieplafond voor nikkel, zoals berekend ingevolge het vierde lid, in het jaar waarin de vergunning wordt verleend, tijdens enig jaar van de voorgenomen produktie dat valt binnen de overgangsperiode.  

e. De aanvrage en de produktievergunning worden een integrerend onderdeel van het goedgekeurde werkplan.  

f. Indien de aanvrage van de exploitant voor een produktievergunning wordt afgewezen op grond van letter d, kan de exploitant te allen tijde opnieuw een aanvrage bij de Autoriteit indienen.     
3.  De overgangsperiode begint vijf jaar vóór de eerste januari van het jaar waarin de aanvang van de vroegste commerciële produktie op grond van een goedgekeurd werkplan is voorgenomen. Indien de vroegste commerciële produktie wordt uitgesteld tot na het oorspronkelijk voorgenomen jaar, worden het begin van de overgangsperiode en het oorspronkelijk berekende produktieplafond dienovereenkomstig gewijzigd. De overgangsperiode duurt 25 jaar of tot het einde van de Herzieningsconferentie, bedoeld in artikel 155 of tot de dag waarop de in het eerste lid bedoelde nieuwe regelingen of overeenkomsten in werking treden, welke van beide het eerst valt. De Autoriteit herkrijgt de in dit artikel bepaalde bevoegdheden voor het resterende gedeelte van de overgangsperiode indien genoemde regelingen of overeenkomsten zouden verstrijken of om enigerlei reden buiten werking zouden treden.   
4.  

a. Het produktieplafond voor enig jaar van de overgangsperiode is het totaal van: 

(i) het verschil tussen de trendlijnwaarden voor het nikkelverbruik, zoals berekend opgrond van letter (b), voor het jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan het jaar van de vroegste commerciële produktie en het jaar onmidddellijk voorafgaand aan de aanvang van de overgangsperiode; en  

(ii) zestig procent van het verschil tussen de trendlijnwaarden voor het nikkelverbruik, zoals berekend op grond van letter (b), voor het jaar waarvoor een aanvraag voor de produktievergunning is ingediend en het jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan het jaar van de vroegste commerciële produktie.    

b. Voor de toepassing van letter (a): 

(i) zijn de trendlijnwaarden gebruikt voor de berekening van het plafond van de nikkelproduktie die waarden voor het jaarlijkse nikkelverk, op een trendlijn, die zijn berekend tijdens het jaar waarin een produktievergunning wordt verleend. De trendlijn wordt afgeleid van neaire regressie van de logaritmen van het feitelijke nikkelverbruik voor de meest recente periode van 15 jaar waarover deze gegevens kbaar zijn, waarbij de tijd als onafhankelijke variabele wordt genomen. Deze trendlijn wordt de oorspronkelijke trendlijn genoemd;  

(ii) indien de jaarlijkse stijging van de oorspronkelijke trendlijn minder dan 3 procent bedraagt, wordt de ter bepaling van de in letter a bedoelde hoeveelheden gebruikte trendlijn echter een trendlijn die de oorspronkelijke trendlijn kruist bij de waarde voor het eerste jaar van de desbetreffende periode van vijftien jaar, en stijgt deze jaarlijks met 3 procent; zulks evenwel op voorwaarde dat het voor enig jaar van de overgangsperiode bepaalde produktieplafond in geen geval het verschil mag overschrijden tussen de oorspronkelijke trendlijnwaarde voor dat jaar en de oorspronkelijke trendlijnwaarde voor het jaar onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan de aanvang van de overgangsperiode.       
5.  De Autoriteit reserveert voor de Onderneming voor haar aanvangsproduktie een hoeveelheid van 38.000 metrieke ton nikkel uit het ingevolge het vierde lid berekende beschikbare produktieplafond.   
6.  

a. Een exploitant mag in enig jaar minder produceren dan het niveau van de jaarlijkse produktie van delfstoffen uit metaalknollen zoals aangegeven in zijn produktievergunning, of dit niveau met ten hoogste 8 procent overschrijden, mits het totaal van de produktie niet de in de vergunning aangegeven omvang overschrijdt. Over een overschot van meer dan 8 procent en tot 20 procent in enig jaar, of een overschot in het eerste jaar en de volgende jaren na twee achtereenvolgende jaren waarin zich overschotten voordoen, moet worden onderhandeld met de Autoriteit, die van de exploitant kan verlangen dat deze een aanvullende produktievergunning aanvraagt ter dekking van de bijkomende produktie.  

b. Aanvragen voor zulke aanvullende produktievergunningen worden door de Autoriteit alleen in overweging genomen nadat alle hangende aanvragen van exploitanten die nog geen produktievergunning hebben ontvangen, zijn behandeld en terdege rekening is gehouden met eventuele andere aanvragers. De Autoriteit heeft als richtsnoer het beginsel dat de ingevolge het produktieplafond totale toegestane produktie niet in enig jaar van de overgangsperiode mag worden overschreden. Zij geeft geen vergunning voor produktie op grond van enig werkplan voor een grotere hoeveelheid dan 46.500 metrieke ton nikkel per jaar.     
7.  De produktieniveaus van andere metalen zoals koper, kobalt en mangaan, gewonnen uit metaalknollen die ingevolge een produktievergunning worden gewonnen, dienen niet hoger te zijn dan die welke zouden zijn geproduceerd indien de exploitant het ingevolge dit artikel berekende maximumniveau nikkel uit deze knollen had geproduceerd. De Autoriteit stelt ingevolge Bijlage III, artikel 17, regels, voorschriften en procedures vast ter toepassing van dit lid.   
8.  De op grond van de desbetreffende multilaterale handelsovereenkomsten geldende rechten en plichten betreffende oneerlijke economische praktijken zijn van toepassing op de exploratie en de exploitatie van delfstoffen in het Gebied. Bij de regeling van zich ingevolge deze bepaling voordoende geschillen, maken Staten die Partij zijn, en die Partij zijn bij zulke multilaterale handelsovereenkomsten gebruik van de procedures voor de regeling van geschillen van zulke overeenkomsten.   
9.  De Autoriteit heeft de bevoegdheid het produktieniveau van delfstoffen in het Gebied, geen delfstoffen uit metaalknollen zijnde, te beperken op de voorwaarden en met toepassing van de methoden die passend kunnen zijn, door het aannemen van voorschriften overeenkomstig artikel 161, achtste lid.   
10.  Op aanbeveling van de Raad, gebaseerd op advies van de Commissie voor economische planning, stelt de Vergadering een compensatiestelsel in of neemt zij andere maatregelen voor steun bij economische aanpassing, met inbegrip van samenwerking met gespecialiseerde organisaties en andere internationale organisaties, om ontwikkelingslanden die ernstige nadelige gevolgen voor hun inkomsten uit export of hun economie ondervinden, als gevolg van een verlaging van de prijs van een delfstof die behoort tot die welke in het Gebied worden gewonnen of een vermindering van de omvang van de export van die delfstof, steun te verlenen, voor zover deze verlaging of vermindering wordt veroorzaakt door werkzaamheden in het Gebied. Op verzoek verricht de Autoriteit onderzoeken naar de problemen van die Staten die het risico lopen het ernstigst te zullen worden getroffen, ten einde hun moeilijkheden tot een minimum te beperken en hen te steunen bij hun economische aanpassing.

Iedere vijf jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag gaat de Vergadering over tot een algemene en stelselmatige toetsing van de wijze waarop de internationale regeling voor het Gebied die is ingesteld in dit Verdrag in de praktijk heeft gewerkt. In het licht van deze toetsing kan de Vergadering maatregelen nemen, of aanbevelen dat andere organen maatregelen nemen, overeenkomstig de bepalingen en procedures van dit Deel en de daarop betrekking hebbende Bijlagen, die zullen leiden tot verbetering van de werking van de regeling.  

### Artikel  155  

####De Herzieningsconferentie

1.  Vijftien jaar na 1 januari van het jaar waarin de eerste commerciële produktie op grond van een goedgekeurd werkplan aanvangt, roept de Vergadering een conferentie bijeen voor de herziening van de bepalingen in dit Deel en de desbetreffende Bijlagen, waarbij het stelsel van exploratie en exploitatie van de rijkdommen van het Gebied wordt geregeld. De Herzieningsconferentie beziet tot in bijzonderheden, in het licht van de tijdens die periode opgedane ervaring: 

a. of de bepalingen van dit Deel, waarbij het stelsel van exploratie en exploitatie van de rijkdommen van het Gebied wordt geregeld, in alle opzichten aan hun doel hebben beantwoord, met inbegrip van de vraag of zij de gehele mensheid ten goede zijn gekomen;  

b. of, tijdens de periode van 15 jaar, gereserveerde gebieden zijn geëxploiteerd op een doeltreffende en evenwichtige wijze, vergeleken met niet-gereserveerde gebieden;  

c. of de ontginning en het gebruik van het Gebied en zijn rijkdommen zijn ondernomen op een wijze waardoor de gezonde ontwikkeling van de wereldeconomie en de evenwichtige groei van het internationale handelsverkeer zijn bevorderd;  

d. of monopolisering van werkzaamheden in het Gebied is voorkomen;  

e. of het in de artikelen 150 en 151 vervatte beleid zijn doelen heeft bereikt;  

f. of het stelsel heeft geleid tot een billijke verdeling van de uit werkzaamheden in het Gebied opgekomen voordelen, zulks met bijzondere inachtneming van de belangen en behoeften van de ontwikkelingsstaten.     
2.  De Herzieningsconferentie verzekert de handhaving van het beginsel van het gemeenschappelijk erfdeel van de mensheid, de internationale regeling waarmede wordt beoogd een billijke exploitatie te verzekeren van de rijkdommen van het Gebied ten bate van alle landen, vooral de ontwikkelingsstaten, en een Autoriteit die de werkzaamheden in het Gebied organiseert, leidt en er toezicht op uitoefent. Zij verzekert tevens de handhaving van de in dit Deel vervatte beginselen ten aanzien van de uitsluiting van aanspraken op of de uitoefening van soevereiniteit over enig deel van het Gebied, de rechten van Staten en hun algemeen optreden met betrekking tot het Gebied en hun deelneming aan werkzaamheden in het Gebied overeenkomstig dit Verdrag, de voorkoming van monopolisering van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, het gebruik van het Gebied uitsluitend voor vreedzame doeleinden, de economische aspecten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, wetenschappelijk zeeonderzoek, overdracht van technologie, bescherming van het mariene milieu, bescherming van mensenlevens, rechten van kuststaten, de juridische status van de boven het Gebied gelegen wateren en van het luchtruim boven die wateren en verenigbaarheid van werkzaamheden in het Gebied en met andere activiteiten in het mariene milieu.   
3.  De besluitvormingsprocedure die geldt voor de Herzieningsconferentie is dezelfde als die welke gold tijdens de Derde Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties inzake het Recht van de Zee. De conferentie stelt alles in het werk om door middel van consensus overeenstemming omtrent wijzigingen te bereiken en er wordt over deze aangelegenheden niet gestemd totdat alle middelen om tot een consensus te komen zijn uitgeput.   
4.  Indien de Herzieningsconferentie vijf jaar nadat zij is aangevangen, geen overeenstemming heeft bereikt omtrent het stelsel van exploratie en exploitatie van de rijkdommen van het Gebied, kan zij tijdens de daarop volgende 12 maanden bij een meerderheid van drie vierde van de Staten die Partij zijn, besluiten de door haar noodzakelijk en passend geachte wijzigingen, waarbij het stelsel wordt gewijzigd of veranderd aan te nemen en voor bekrachtiging of toetreding voor te leggen aan de Staten die Partij zijn. Deze wijzigingen treden voor alle Staten die Partij zijn in werking 12 maanden na de nederlegging van akten van bekrachtiging of toetreding door drie vierde van de Staten die Partij zijn.   
5.  Ingevolge dit artikel door de Herzieningsconferentie aangenomen wijzigingen laten krachtens bestaande contracten verworven rechten onverlet.

####DE RAAD

### Artikel  161  

####Samenstelling, procedure en wijze van stemmen

1.  De Raad bestaat uit 36 leden van de Autoriteit, die door de Vergadering worden gekozen in de onderstaande volgorde: 

a. vier leden uit de Staten die Partij zijn die, gedurende de laatste vijf jaar waarvoor statistieken beschikbaar zijn, hetzij meer dan 2 procent van het totale wereldverbruik hebben verbruikt, hetzij een netto invoer hebben gehad van meer dan 2 procent van de totale wereldinvoer van de grondstoffen, geproduceerd uit de categorieën delfstoffen die in het Gebied zullen worden gewonnen, en in elk geval een Staat uit de Oosteuropese (socialistische) regio, alsmede de grootste verbruiker;  

b. vier leden uit de acht Staten die Partij zijn die de grootste investeringen hebben in de voorbereiding en het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, hetzij direct, hetzij via hun onderdanen, waaronder ten minste een Staat uit de Oosteuropese (socialistische) regio;  

c. vier leden uit de Staten die Partij zijn die op basis van de produktie in onder hun rechtsmacht vallende gebieden grote netto exporteurs zijn van de categorieën metalen die zullen worden gewonnen in het Gebied, waaronder ten minste twee ontwikkelingsstaten wier exporten van zulke delfstoffen van aanzienlijk belang zijn voor hun economie;  

d. zes leden uit de ontwikkelingsstaten die Partij zijn, die bijzondere belangen vertegenwoordigen. De te vertegenwoordigen bijzondere belangen omvatten die van Staten met een grote bevolking, Staten zonder zeekust of Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging, Staten die grote importeurs zijn van de categorieën metalen die uit het Gebied zullen worden gewonnen, Staten die potentiële producenten van zulke delfstoffen zijn, en de minst ontwikkelde Staten;  

e. achttien leden, gekozen volgens het beginsel dat een billijke geografische verdeling van zetels in de Raad als geheel moet worden verzekerd, met dien verstande dat elke geografische regio ten minste één op grond van deze letter gekozen lid heeft. Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling zijn de geografische regio's Afrika, Azië, Oosteuropa (socialistisch), Latijns-Amerika, alsmede West-Europa en andere Staten.     
2.  Bij de verkiezing van leden van de Raad overeenkomstig het eerste lid verzekert de Vergadering dat: 

a. Staten zonder zeekust en Staten met een ongunstige geografische ligging vertegenwoordigd zijn in een mate die in redelijke verhouding staat tot hun vertegenwoordiging in de Vergadering;  

b. kuststaten, vooral ontwikkelingsstaten, die niet in aanmerking komen ingevolge het eerste lid, letter a, b, c of d, zijn vertegenwoordigd in een mate die in redelijke verhouding staat tot hun vertegenwoordiging in de Vergadering;  

c. elke groep Staten die Partij zijn en die vertegenwoordigd moet zijn in de Raad, wordt vertegenwoordigd door die leden die eventueel door die groep zijn voorgedragen.     
3.  De verkiezingen vinden plaats tijdens de gewone zittingen van de Vergadering. Elk lid van de Raad wordt gekozen voor vier jaar. Tijdens de eerste verkiezing is de ambtstermijn van de helft van de leden van elke in het eerste lid bedoelde groep evenwel twee jaar.   
4.  De leden van de Raad zijn herkiesbaar, maar voldoende aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de wenselijkheid van een roulering van het lidmaatschap.   
5.  De Raad oefent zijn functies ter plaatse van de zetel van de Autoriteit en komt zo vaak bijeen als de werkzaamheden van de Autoriteit vereisen, doch niet minder dan driemaal per jaar.   
6.  Een meerderheid van de leden van de Raad vormt een quorum.   
7.  Elk lid van de Raad heeft één stem.   
8.  

a. Besluiten inzake procedurekwesties worden genomen met een meerderheid van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen.

De Staten stellen, optredend via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie, internationale regels en normen vast ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu door schepen en bevorderen, waar passend, de aanneming op dezelfde wijze van verkeersstelsels met het oogmerk het risico van ongevallen die verontreiniging van het mariene milieu, met inbegrip van de kustlijn, en verontreinigingsschade aan de daarmede samenhangende belangen van kuststaten zouden kunnen veroorzaken, tot een minimum te beperken. Deze regels en normen worden op dezelfde wijze van tijd tot tijd waar nodig opnieuw bezien.   
2.  De Staten nemen wetten en voorschriften aan ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu door schepen die hun vlag voeren of bij hen staan geregistreerd. Deze wetten en voorschriften dienen niet minder doeltreffend te zijn dan die van algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels en normen vastgesteld via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie.   
3.  De Staten die bijzondere eisen vaststellen voor de voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu als voorwaarde voor de binnenkomst van vreemde schepen in hun havens of binnenwateren of voor het aanlopen van hun laad- of losplaatsen buitengaats dienen naar behoren bekendheid te geven aan deze vereisten en deze mede te delen aan de bevoegde internationale organisatie. Wanneer deze eisen in gelijke vorm worden vastgesteld door twee of meer kuststaten bij het streven naar harmonisatie van het beleid, wordt in de mededeling aangegeven welke Staten aan deze samenwerkingsregelingen deelnemen. Iedere Staat eist van de kapitein van een schip dat zijn vlag voert of bij die Staat is geregistreerd, wanneer dit vaart binnen de territoriale zee van een aan zulke samenwerkingsregelingen deelnemende Staat, dat hij op verzoek van die Staat de Informatie verstrekt of het schip vaart naar een Staat in dezelfde regio die deelneemt aan zulke samenwerkingsregelingen en indien dat het geval is, meldt of het schip voldoet aan de vereisten inzake binnenkomst in een haven van die Staat. Dit artikel laat onverlet de voortdurende uitoefening door een schip van zijn recht van onschuldige doorvaart alsmede de toepassing van artikel 25, tweede lid.   
4.  Kuststaten kunnen, bij de uitoefening van hun soevereiniteit binnen hun territoriale zee, wetten en voorschriften aannemen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van mariene verontreiniging door vreemde schepen, met inbegrip van schepen die het recht van onschuldige doorvaart uitoefenen. Deze wetten en voorschriften mogen, overeenkomstig Deel II, afdeling 3, de onschuldige doorvaart van vreemde schepen niet belemmeren.   
5.  Kuststaten kunnen, ter fine van de handhaving van de bepalingen, zoals neergelegd in afdeling 6, ten aanzien van hun exclusieve economische zones wetten en voorschriften aannemen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen, welke overeenstemmen met en uitvoering geven aan algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels en normen, vastgesteld via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie.   
6.  

a. Wanneer de in het eerste lid bedoelde internationale regels en normen ontoereikend zijn om te voorzien in bijzondere omstandigheden en kuststaten redelijke gronden hebben om aan te nemen dat een bepaald duidelijk omschreven gebied van hun onderscheiden exclusieve economische zones een gebied is, ten aanzien waarvan de aanneming van bijzondere verplichte maatregelen ter voorkoming van verontreiniging door schepen vereist is om erkende technische redenen met betrekking tot de oceanografische en ecologische omstandigheden in dat gebied, alsmede het gebruik of de bescherming van de rijkdommen daarvan en het speciale karakter van het verkeer daarin, kunnen de kuststaten, na passend overleg via de bevoegde internationale organisatie met andere betrokken Staten, voor dat gebied een mededeling aan die organisatie richten, waarbij ter staving wetenschappelijk en technisch bewijsmateriaal wordt voorgelegd, alsook informatie inzake de noodzakelijke ontvangstinrichtingen. Binnen 12 maanden na ontvangst van een zodanige mededeling bepaalt de organisatie of de situatie in dat gebied voldoet aan de hierboven uiteengezette eisen. Indien de organisatie aldus bepaalt, kan de kuststaat voor dat gebied wetten en voorschriften aannemen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen, met toepassing van de internationale regels en normen of gebruiken bij de navigatie die via de organisatie, van toepassing zijn verklaard op bijzondere gebieden. Deze wetten en voorschriften worden niet eerder van toepassing op vreemde schepen dan 15 maanden na indiening van de mededeling bij de organisatie.  

b. De kuststaten geven bekendheid aan de begrenzing van een zodanig duidelijk omschreven gebied.  

c. Indien de kuststaten voornemens zijn aanvullende wetten en voorschriften voor hetzelfde gebied aan te nemen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen dienen zij, wanneer zij de voorgenoemde mededeling indienen, tegelijkertijd de organisatie daarvan in kennis te stellen. Deze aanvullende wetten en voorschriften kunnen betrekking hebben op lozingen of gebruiken bij de navigatie, maar daarin mag niet van vreemde schepen worden verlangd dat andere normen inzake ontwerp, constructie, bemanning of uitrusting worden nageleefd dan algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels en normen; zij worden van toepassing op vreemde schepen 15 maanden na indiening van de mededeling bij de organisatie mits de organisatie binnen 12 maanden na indiening van de mededeling daarmede instemt.     
7.  De in dit artikel bedoelde internationale regels en normen dienen onder andere die te omvatten welke betrekking hebben op onverwijlde kennisgeving aan kuststaten, wier kustlijn of daarmede samenhangende belangen kunnen worden getroffen door voorvallen, met inbegrip van maritieme ongevallen, die lozingen of het risico van lozingen met zich brengen.   

### Artikel  212  

####Verontreiniging vanuit of via de dampkring

1.  De Staten nemen wetten en voorschriften aan ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu vanuit of via de dampkring, welke toepasselijk zijn op het luchtruim waarover zij soevereiniteit uitoefenen en op schepen die hun vlag voeren of schepen of luchtvaartuigen die bij hen staan geregistreerd, met inachtneming van internationaal overeengekomen regels, normen en aanbevolen praktijken en procedures en de veiligheid van de luchtvaart.   
2.  De Staten nemen de andere maatregelen die noodzakelijk kunnen zijn ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van zodanige verontreiniging.   
3.  De Staten, daarbij in het bijzonder optredend via bevoegde internationale organisaties of een diplomatieke conferentie, trachten mondiale en regionale regels, normen en aanbevolen praktijken en procedures vast te stellen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van zodanige verontreiniging.

De Staten handhaven de bepalingen van hun overeenkomstig artikel 208 aangenomen wetten en voorschriften en nemen de wetten en voorschriften aan en nemen andere maatregelen die nodig zijn ter uitvoering van van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen, vastgesteld via bevoegde internationale organisaties of een diplomatieke conferentie ter voorkoming, verminderingen bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu, voortvloeiend uit of verband houdend met werkzaamheden op de zeebodem onder hun rechtsmacht verricht, alsmede veroorzaakt door kunstmatige eilanden, installaties en inrichtingen onder hun rechtsmacht ingevolge de artikelen 60 en 80.  

### Artikel  215  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen met betrekking tot verontreiniging door werkzaamheden in het Gebied

De handhaving van het bepaalde in internationale regels, voorschriften en procedures, die zijn vastgesteld overeenkomstig Deel XI ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu door werkzaamheden in het Gebied, wordt geregeld in dat Deel.  

### Artikel  216  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen met betrekking tot verontreiniging door storting

1.  De handhaving van de bepalingen van de wetten en voorschriften, aangenomen overeenkomstig dit Verdrag en van de van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en voorschriften, vastgesteld via bevoegde internationale organisaties of een diplomatieke conferentie ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu door storting, geschiedt: 

a. door de kuststaat met betrekking tot storting binnen zijn territoriale zee of zijn exclusieve economische zone of op zijn continentale plat;  

b. door de vlaggestaat met betrekking tot schepen die zijn vlag voeren of schepen of luchtvaartuigen die bij deze Staat zijn geregistreerd;  

c. door elke Staat met betrekking tot het laden van afvalstoffen of andere materialen dat geschiedt binnen zijn grondgebied of op zijn laadof losplaatsen buitengaats.     
2.  Een Staat wordt niet uit hoofde van dit artikel verplicht een rechtsvervolging in te stellen wanneer een andere Staat reeds overeenkomstig dit artikel een rechtsvervolging heeft ingesteld.   

### Artikel  217  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen door vlaggestaten

1.  De Staten verzekeren de naleving door schepen die hun vlag voeren of bij hen geregistreerd zijn van de van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen, vastgesteld via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie, en van hun overeenkomstig dit Verdrag aangenomen wetten en voorschriften ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu door schepen en nemen dienovereenkomstig wetten en voorschriften aan en nemen andere maatregelen die nodig zijn voor de toepassing ervan. De vlaggestaten zien toe op de doeltreffende handhaving van het bepaalde in zodanige regels, normen, wetten en voorschriften, ongeacht waar zich een overtreding voordoet.   
2.  De Staten nemen inzonderheid passende maatregelen ten einde te verzekeren dat aan schepen die hun vlag voeren of bij hen staan geregistreerd wordt verboden uit te varen, totdat zij zee kunnen kiezen met inachtneming van de vereisten van de in het eerste lid bedoelde internationale regels en normen, met inbegrip van de vereisten met betrekking tot het ontwerp, de constructie, uitrusting en bemanning van schepen.   
3.  De Staten verzekeren dat schepen die hun vlag voeren of bij hen zijn geregistreerd de certificaten aan boord hebben die worden vereist door en afgegeven ingevolge de in het eerste lid bedoelde internationale regels en normen. De Staten verzekeren dat schepen die hun vlag voeren periodiek worden geïnspecteerd ten einde na te gaan of deze certificaten in overeenstemming zijn met de feitelijke staat waarin de schepen verkeren. Deze certificaten worden door andere Staten aanvaard als bewijs van de staat waarin de schepen verkeren en worden door hen geacht dezelfde rechtskracht te bezitten als door hen afgegeven certificaten, tenzij er duidelijke redenen bestaan om aan te nemen dat de staat waarin het schip verkeert niet wezenlijk overeenkomt met de gegevens van de certificaten.   
4.  Indien een schip een overtreding begaat van via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie vastgestelde regels en normen, zorgt de vlaggestaat, onverminderd de artikelen 218, 220 en 228, vooreen onmiddellijk onderzoek en stelt waar passend een rechtsvervolging in met betrekking tot de beweerde overtreding, ongeacht waar de overtreding zich heeft voorgedaan of waar de door deze overtreding veroorzaakte verontreiniging zich heeft voorgedaan of is geconstateerd.   
5.  Vlaggestaten die een onderzoek naar de overtreding verrichten, kunnen de bijstand verzoeken van andere Staten wier medewerking nuttig zou kunnen zijn bij het ophelderen van de desbetreffende omstandigheden. De Staten trachten aan passende verzoeken van vlaggestaten te voldoen.   
6.  De Staten stellen, op schriftelijk verzoek van een Staat, een onderzoek in naar overtredingen, waarvan wordt beweerd dat deze zijn begaan door schepen die hun vlag voeren. Indien te hunnen genoegen is aangetoond dat voldoende bewijsmateriaal beschikbaar is om een rechtsvervolging te kunnen instellen met betrekking tot de beweerde overtreding, stellen vlaggestaten onverwijld een zodanige rechtsvervolging overeenkomstig hun wetten in.   
7.  Vlaggestaten stellen de verzoekende Staat en de bevoegde internationale organisatie onverwijld in kennis van de ondernomen stappen en de resultaten daarvan. Deze informatie is voor alle Staten beschikbaar.   
8.  De in de wetten en voorschriften van Staten voorziene straffen voor schepen die hun vlag voeren dienen zwaar genoeg te zijn om deze van overtredingen, waar deze zich ook voordoen, te weerhouden.   

### Artikel  218  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen door havenstaten

1.  Wanneer een schip zich vrijwillig in een haven of op een laad- of losplaats buitengaats van een Staat bevindt, kan die Staat een onderzoek doen en, wanneer het bewijsmateriaal zulks vereist, een rechtsvervolging instellen met betrekking tot enige lozing uit dat schip buiten de binnenwateren, de territoriale zee of exclusieve economische zone van die Staat in overtreding van van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen, vastgesteld via de bevoegde internationale organisatie of een algemene diplomatieke conferentie.   
2.  Er wordt door bovenbedoelde Staat geen rechtsvervolging ingevolge het eerste lid ingesteld met betrekking tot een lozing die een overtreding vormt in de binnenwateren, de territoriale zee of de exclusieve economische zone van een andere Staat, tenzij daarom verzocht wordt door die Staat, de vlaggestaat of een Staat die schade heeft geleden of risico's loopt door de lozing die een overtreding vormt, of tenzij de schending verontreiniging heeft veroorzaakt of dreigt te veroorzaken in de binnenwateren, de territoriale zee of exclusieve economische zone van de Staat die de rechtsvervolging instelt.   
3.  Wanneer een schip zich vrijwillig in een haven of op een laad- of losplaats buitengaats van een Staat bevindt, voldoet die Staat, voor zover uitvoerbaar, aan verzoeken van andere Staten om onderzoek naar een lozing die een overtreding vormt, zoals bedoeld in het eerste lid, waarvan wordt aangenomen dat deze zich heeft voorgedaan in, schade heeft veroorzaakt of dreigde te veroorzaken in de binnenwateren, de territoriale zee of de exclusieve economische zone van de verzoekende Staat. Hij voldoet eveneens, voor zover uitvoerbaar, aan verzoeken van de vlaggestaat om onderzoek naar zulk een overtreding, ongeacht waar de overtreding zich heeft voorgedaan.   
4.  Het dossier van een ingevolge dit artikel door een havenstaat verricht onderzoek wordt op verzoek toegezonden aan de vlaggestaat of de kuststaat. Een op basis van zulk een onderzoek door de havenstaat ingestelde rechtsvervolging kan, onverminderd het bepaalde in afdeling 7, worden geschorst op verzoek van de kuststaat wanneer de overtreding zich heeft voorgedaan binnen zijn binnenwateren, territoriale zee of exclusieve economische zone. Het bewijsmateriaal en het dossier van de zaak, te zamen met een borgstelling of andere financiële zekerheid nedergelegd bij de autoriteiten van de havenstaat, worden in dat geval overgedragen aan de kuststaat. Deze overdracht sluit de voortzetting van de rechtsvervolging in de havenstaat uit.   

### Artikel  219  

####Maatregelen betreffende de zeewaardigheid van schepen ter vermijding van verontreiniging

Onverminderd het bepaalde in afdeling 7 nemen Staten die, op verzoek of eigener beweging, hebben geconstateerd dat een schip in een van hun havens of op een van hun laad- of losplaatsen buitengaats, de van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen betreffende de zeewaardigheid van schepen overtreedt en daardoor het mariene milieu schade dreigt toe te brengen, voor zover uitvoerbaar, administratieve maatregelen om het schip te beletten uit te varen. Deze Staten kunnen het schip toestaan, slechts verder te varen naar de dichtstbijzijnde geschikte reparatiewerf en, na wegneming van de oorzaken van de overtreding, staan zij het schip toe, onmiddellijk verder te varen.  

### Artikel  220  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen door kuststaten

1.  Wanneer een schip zich vrijwillig in een haven of op een laad- of losplaats buitengaats van een Staat bevindt, kan die Staat, onder voorbehoud van het bepaald in afdeling 7, een rechtsvervolging instellen met betrekking tot overtredingen van zijn overeenkomstig dit Verdrag of van toepassing zijnde internatonale regels en normen aangenomen wetten en voorschriften ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen wanneer de overtreding zich heeft voorgedaan binnen de territoriale zee of de exclusieve economische zone van die Staat.   
2.  Wanneer er duidelijke redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een in de territoriale zee van een Staat varend schip tijdens zijn doorvaart, overeenkomstig dit Verdrag aangenomen wetten en voorschriften van die Staat of van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen heeft overtreden, kan die Staat onverminderd de toepassing van de desbetreffende bepalingen van Deel II, afdeling 3, overgaan tot de feitelijke inspectie van het schip met betrekking tot de overtreding en kan hij, wanneer het bewijsmateriaal zulks vereist, een rechtsvervolging instellen, met inbegrip van de vasthouding van het schip, overeenkomstig zijn wetten, onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in afdeling 7.   
3.  Wanneer er duidelijke redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat een schip varend in de exclusieve economische zone of de territoriale zee van een Staat in de exclusieve economische zone een overtreding heeft begaan van van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen voor de voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging door schepen of van de wetten en voorschriften van die Staat, aangenomen overeenkomstig en ter uitvoering van zodanige regels en normen, kan die Staat verlangen dat het schip informatie verstrekt aangaande zijn identiteit en haven van registratie, zijn laatste en zijn volgende aanloophaven en andere van belang zijnde informatie, vereist om vast te stellen of zich een overtreding heeft voorgedaan.   
4.  Staten nemen wetten en voorschriften aan en nemen andere maatregelen zodat schepen die hun vlag voeren, voldoen aan verzoeken om informatie ingevolge het derde lid.   
5.  Wanneer er duidelijke redenen zijn om aan te nemen, dat een schip varend in de exclusieve economische zone of de territoriale zee van een Staat, in de exclusieve economische zone een overtreding heeft begaan zoals bedoeld in het derde lid, leidend tot een aanzienlijke lozing die aanmerkelijke verontreiniging van het mariene milieu veroorzaakt of dreigt te veroorzaken, kan die Staat overgaan tot feitelijke inspectie van het schip voor aangelegenheden betreffende de overtreding indien het schip geweigerd heeft informatie te verstrekken, of indien de door het schip verstrekte informatie zeer duidelijk afwijkt van de feitelijke situatie en indien de omstandigheden van het geval een zodanige inspectie rechtvaardigen.   
6.  Wanneer er duidelijke redenen zijn om aan te nemen, dat een schip, varend in de exclusieve economische zone of de territoriale zee van een Staat, in de exclusieve economische zone een overtreding heeft begaan zoals bedoeld in het derde lid, leidend tot een lozing die grote schade of het risico van grote schade aan de kustlijn of daarmede samenhangende belangen van de kuststaat veroorzaakt, dan wel aan de rijkdommen van zijn territoriale zee of exclusieve economische zone, kan die staat, onverminderd het bepaalde in afdeling 7, mits het bewijs materiaal zulks rechtvaardigt, een rechtsvervolging instellen, met inbegrip van de vasthouding van het schip, overeenkomstig zijn wetten.   
7.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het zesde lid, laat de kuststaat, indien er passende procedures zijn vastgesteld via de bevoegde internationale organisaties of zoals anderszins overeengekomen, waarbij het naleven van de vereisten inzake borgstelling of een andere passende vorm van financiële zekerheid is verzekerd, indien deze Staat door zulke procedures is gebonden, het schip de reis voortzetten.   
8.  De bepalingen van het derde, vierde, vijfde, zesde en zevende lid, zijn ook van toepassing met betrekking tot nationale wetten en voorschriften, aangenomen krachtens artikel 211, zesde lid.   

### Artikel  221  

####Maatregelen ter vermijding van verontreiniging, voortvloeiend uit ongevallen ter zee

1.  Niets in dit Deel doet afbreuk aan het recht van Staten ingevolge het internationale recht, zowel het gewoonterecht als het gecodificeerde recht, maatregelen te nemen en te handhaven buiten de territoriale zee, naar evenredigheid van de feitelijke of dreigende schade, ter bescherming van hun kustlijn of daarmede samenhangende belangen, met inbegrip van de visserij, tegen verontreiniging of de dreiging van verontreiniging na een ongeval ter zee of na handelingen samenhangend met een zodanig ongeval, waarvan redelijkerwijze kan worden verwacht dat deze zullen leiden tot aanzienlijke schadelijke gevolgen.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt onder „ongeval ter zee” verstaan een aanvaring van schepen, het stranden of een ander scheepvaartvoorval of andere gebeurtenis aan boord van een schip of daarbuiten, leidend tot materiële schade of onmiddellijke dreiging van materiële schade aan een schip of de lading.   

### Artikel  222  

####Handhaving van de bepalingen met betrekking tot verontreiniging vanuit of via de dampkring

Binnen het luchtruim onder hun soevereiniteit of met betrekking tot schepen die hun vlag voeren of schepen of luchtvaartuigen die bij hen zijn geregistreerd, handhavende Staten hun overeenkomstig artikel 212, eerste lid, en andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag aangenomen wetten en voorschriften en nemen zij de wetten en voorschriften aan en nemen zij de andere maatregelen die noodzakelijk zijn ter toepassing van van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen, vastgesteld via bevoegde internationale organisaties of een diplomatieke conferentie ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu vanuit of via de dampkring, zulks in overeenstemming met alle desbetreffende internationale regels en normen betreffende de veiligheid van de luchtvaart.  

### AFDELING  7  

####WAARBORGEN

### Artikel  223  

####Maatregelen ter vergemakkelijking van rechtsvervolging

Bij een ingevolge dit Deel ingestelde rechtsvervolging nemen de Staten maatregelen ter vergemakkelijking van het horen van getuigen en de toelating van bewijsmateriaal, ingediend door autoriteiten van een andere Staat of door de bevoegde internationale organisatie en vergemakkelijken zij het bijwonen van een zodanige rechtsvervolging door officiële vertegenwoordigers van de bevoegde internationale organisatie, de vlaggestaat en Staten, getroffen door de uit overtredingen voortvloeiende verontreiniging. De officiële vertegenwoordigers die een zodanige rechtsvervolging bijwonen, hebben de rechten en plichten die zijn bepaald krachtens de nationale wetten en voorschriften of het internationale recht.  

### Artikel  224  

####Uitoefening van bevoegdheden tot handhaving van de bepalingen

De ingevolge dit Deel toegekende bevoegdheden tot handhaving van de bepalingen ten aanzien van vreemde schepen mogen slechts worden uitgeoefend door overheidsfunctionarissen of door oorlogsschepen, militaire luchtvaartuigen of andere schepen of luchtvaartuigen met kentekens waaruit duidelijk blijkt dat zij in dienst zijn van de Staat en die daartoe gemachtigd zijn.  

### Artikel  225  

####Plicht tot vermijding van nadelige gevolgen bij de uitoefening van de bevoegdheden tot handhaving van de bepalingen

Bij de uitoefening ingevolge dit Verdrag van hun bevoegdheden tot handhaving van de bepalingen ten aanzien van vreemde schepen, mogen de Staten niet de veiligheid van de scheepvaart in gevaar brengen of anderszins een gevaar scheppen voor een schip of het naar een onveilige haven of ankerplaats brengen of het mariene milieu aan een onredelijk risico blootstellen.  

### Artikel  226  

####Onderzoek van vreemde schepen

1.  

a. De Staten dienen een vreemd schip niet langer op te houden dan beslist noodzakelijk is voor de in de artikelen 216, 218 en 220 bedoelde onderzoeken. Een feitelijke inspectie van een vreemd schip dient beperkt te blijven tot een onderzoek van de certificaten, registers of andere documenten die het schip volgens de algemeen aanvaarde internationale regels en normen aan boord dient te hebben of van soortgelijke documenten die het aan boord heeft; een nadere feitelijke inspectie van het schip mag alleen worden verricht na zulk een onderzoek en alleen wanneer: 

(i) er duidelijke redenen bestaan om aan te nemen dat de staat waarin het schip of zijn uitrusting verkeert, niet wezenlijk overeenstemt met de gegevens van die documenten;  

(ii) de inhoud van zulke documenten niet voldoende is om een vermoede overtreding te bevestigen of te verifiëren;  

(iii) het schip geen geldige certificaten en registers aan boord heeft.    

b. Indien uit het onderzoek een overtreding van de van toepassing zijnde wetten en voorschriften of internationale regels en normen voor de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu blijkt, wordt het schip onverwijld vrijgegeven, behoudens redelijke procedures zoals borgstelling of het verstrekken van een andere passende financiële zekerheid;  

c. Onverminderd de van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen betreffende de zeewaardigheid van schepen, kan het vrijgeven van een schip, wanneer dit een onredelijk risico van schade aan het mariene milieu zou opleveren, worden geweigerd of afhankelijk worden gesteld van het varen naar de dichtstbijzijnde geschikte reparatiewerf. Wanneer het vrijgeven is geweigerd of daaraan voorwaarden zijn verbonden, dient de vlaggestaat van het schip daarvan onverwijld in kennis te worden gesteld en kan deze het vrijgeven van het schip verzoeken overeenkomstig Deel XV.     
2.  De Staten werken samen bij het uitwerken van procedures ter vermijding van onnodige feitelijke inspectie van schepen op zee.   

### Artikel  227  

####Non-discriminatie met betrekking tot vreemde schepen

Bij de uitoefening van hun rechten en het nakomen van hun verplichtingen ingevolge dit Deel maken de Staten niet rechtens of in feite onderscheid ten aanzien van schepen van andere Staten.  

### Artikel  228  

####Schorsing van en beperkingen op de instelling van rechtsvervolging

1.  Een strafrechtelijke vervolging met betrekking tot overtredingen van van toepassing zijnde wetten en voorschriften of internationale regels en normen betreffende het voorkomen, verminderen en bestrijden van verontreiniging door schepen, begaan door een vreemd schip buiten de territoriale zee van de Staat die de rechtsvervolging instelt, wordt geschorst bij het instellen van een strafrechtelijke vervolging met betrekking tot overeenkomstige aanklachten door de vlaggestaat binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop de rechtsvervolging oorspronkelijk werd ingesteld, tenzij deze rechtsvervolging betrekking heeft op een geval van grote schade voor de kuststaat, of de desbetreffende vlaggestaat herhaaldelijk zijn verplichtingen tot doeltreffende handhaving van de bepalingen van de van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen met betrekking tot door zijn schepen begane overtredingen heeft genegeerd. De vlaggestaat stelt te zijner tijd aan de Staat die eerder de rechtsvervolging had ingesteld een volledig dossier van de zaak en de akten van de rechtsvervolging ter beschikking, wanneer de vlaggestaat de schorsing van de rechtsvervolging heeft verzocht overeenkomstig dit artikel. Wanneer de door de vlaggestaat ingestelde rechtsvervolging tot een einde is gebracht, wordt de geschorste rechtsvervolging beëindigd. Bij betaling van de met betrekking tot een zodanige rechtsvervolging gemaakte kosten, wordt een borgstelling of andere financiële zekerheid verschaft in verband met de geschorste rechtsvervolging door de kuststaat vrijgegeven.   
2.  Strafrechtelijke vervolging tegen vreemde schepen wordt niet ingesteld na het verstrijken van drie jaar van de datum waarop de overtreding werd begaan en wordt niet door een Staat ondernomen ingeval een andere Staat een rechtsvervolging heeft ingesteld, zulks onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen vervat in het eerste lid.   
3.  De bepalingen van dit artikel laten onverlet het recht van de vlaggestaat tot het nemen van maatregelen, met inbegrip van strafrechtelijke vervolging, overeenkomstig zijn wetten, ongeacht eerdere rechtsvervolging door een andere Staat.   

### Artikel  229  

####Instelling van civiele procedures

Niets in dit Verdrag is van invloed op de instelling van een civiele procedure met betrekking tot een vordering wegens verlies of schade, voortvloeiend uit verontreiniging van het mariene milieu.  

### Artikel  230  

####Boetes en de inachtneming van de erkende rechten van de beschuldigde

1.  Met betrekking tot overtredingen van nationale wetten en voorschriften of van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu, begaan door vreemde schepen buiten de territoriale zee, kunnen alleen boetes worden opgelegd.   
2.  Met betrekking tot overtredingen van nationale wetten en voorschriften of van toepassing zijnde internationale regels en normen ter voorkoming, vermindering en bestrijding van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu, begaan door vreemde schepen in de territoriale zee, kunnen alleen boetes worden opgelegd, behalve in het geval van een opzettelijke en ernstige daad van verontreiniging in de territoriale zee.   
3.  Tijdens een rechtsvervolging met betrekking tot zulke overtredinen, begaan door een vreemd schip, die kan leiden tot de oplegging van straffen, dienen de erkende rechten van de beschuldigde in acht te worden genomen.   

### Artikel  231  

####Kennisgeving aan de vlaggestaat en andere betrokken Staten

De Staten stellen onverwijld de vlaggestaat en andere betrokken Staten in kennis van krachtens afdeling 6 genomen maatregelen tegen vreemde schepen en leggen alle officiële rapporten betreffende zulke maatregelen voor aan de vlaggestaat. Met betrekking evenwel tot overtredingen, begaan in de territoriale zee, zijn de bovenstaande verplichtingen van de kuststaat alleen van toepassing op de maatregelen die bij een rechtsvervolging worden genomen. De diplomatieke vertegenwoordigers of consulaire ambtenaren en waar mogelijk de maritieme autoriteit van de vlaggestaat worden onmiddellijk op de hoogte gesteld van zulke krachtens afdeling 6 tegen vreemde schepen genomen maatregelen.

Een Staat die Partij is, die een verklaring ingevolge het eerste lid heeft afgelegd is niet bevoegd een geschil dat onder een uitgesloten groep geschillen valt te onderwerpen aan enige in dit Verdrag bedoelde procedure zonder de toestemming van de Staat die Partij is waarmee hij het geschil heeft.   
4.  Indien een van de Staten die Partij zijn een verklaring ingevolge het eerste lid, letter a, heeft afgelegd, kan elke andere Staat die Partij is een geschil dat onder een uitgesloten groep geschillen valt en dat deze met de verklarende partij heeft, onderwerpen aan de in die verklaring genoemde procedure.   
5.  Een nieuwe verklaring, of het intrekken van een verklaring tast geenszins de procedures aan die voor een hof of scheidsgerecht lopen overeenkomstig dit artikel, tenzij de partijen anderszins overeenkomen.   
6.  Verklaringen en kennisgevingen van het intrekken ervan krachtens dit artikel worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die een afschrift ervan doet toekomen aan de Staten die Partij zijn.   

### Artikel  299

2.  Niets in deze afdeling maakt inbreuk op het recht van de partijen bij een geschil, een andere procedure voor de regeling van het geschil overeen te komen of het bij minnelijke schikking te regelen.

### Artikel  300  

####Goede trouw en misbruik van recht

### Artikel  311  

####Verhouding tot andere internationale overeenkomsten

1.  Tussen de Staten die Partij zijn, gaat dit Verdrag boven de Verdragen van Genève inzake het recht van de zee van 29 april 1958.   
2.  Dit Verdrag wijzigt niet de rechten en plichten van de Staten die Partij zijn welke voortvloeien uit andere internationale overeenkomsten, die verenigbaar zijn met dit Verdrag en die noch het genot van de aan de andere Staten die Partij zijn, op grond van dit Verdrag toekomende rechten, noch het nakomen van hun plichten op grond van dit Verdrag aantasten.   
3.  Twee of meer Staten die Partij zijn kunnen overeenkomsten tot wijziging of schorsing van de werking van bepalingen van dit Verdrag sluiten, die uitsluitend van toepassing zijn op hun onderlinge betrekkingen, mits dergelijke overeenkomsten zich niet uitstrekken tot een bepaling waarvan niet mag worden afgeweken als dit onverenigbaar is met de doeltreffende verwezenlijking van voorwerp en doel van het Verdrag, en mits dergelijke overeenkomsten voorts niet de toepassing van de grondbeginselen die erin zijn neergelegd, aantasten en de bepalingen van dergelijke overeenkomsten noch het genot van de aan de andere Staten die Partij zijn, op grond van dit Verdrag toekomende rechten, noch het nakomen van hun plichten op grond van dit Verdrag aantasten.

### Artikel  312  

####Wijziging

1.  Na afloop van een periode van 10 jaar vanaf de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag kan een Staat die Partij is door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, specifieke wijzigingen op dit Verdrag voorstellen, die niet betrekking hebben op de werkzaamheden in het Gebied, en verzoeken om de bijeenroeping van een conferentie, die de voorgestelde wijzigingen moet bespreken. De Secretaris-Generaal brengt een dergelijke kennisgeving over aan alle Staten die Partij zijn. Hij roept de conferentie bijeen indien binnen 12 maanden vanaf de datum van toezending van de kennisgeving ten minste de helft van de Staten die Partij zijn in positieve zin antwoordt op het verzoek.   
2.  De besluitvormingsprocedure die van toepassing is op de conferentie tot wijziging, is dezelfde als die welke van toepassing is op de Derde Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties inzake het recht van de zee, tenzij de conferentie anders besluit. De conferentie behoort alles in het werk te stellen om overeenstemming over de wijzigingen te bereiken door middel van consensus, en er behoort niet over te worden gestemd totdat alle pogingen om tot consensus te komen op niets zijn uitgelopen.   

### Artikel  313  

####Wijziging doormiddel van een vereenvoudigde procedure

1.  Een Staat die Partij is kan door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, een wijziging op dit Verdrag voorstellen die niet betrekking heeft op de werkzaamheden in het Gebied, en die door middel van de in dit artikel opgenomen vereenvoudigde procedure wordt aangenomen zonder de bijeenroeping van een conferentie. De Secretaris-Generaal brengt de kennisgeving over aan alle Staten die Partij zijn.   
2.  Indien binnen 12 maanden vanaf de datum van toezending van de kennisgeving een Staat die Partij is bezwaar maakt tegen de voorgestelde wijziging of tegen het voorstel tot aanneming ervan door middel van de vereenvoudigde procedure, wordt de voorgestelde wijziging geacht te zijn verworpen. De Secretaris-Generaal brengt dit onmiddellijk ter kennis van alle Staten die Partij zijn.   
3.  Indien binnen 12 maanden vanaf de datum van toezending van de kennisgeving geen Staat die Partij is bezwaar heeft gemaakt tegen de voorgestelde wijziging of tegen het voorstel tot aanneming ervan door middel van de vereenvoudigde procedure, wordt de voorgestelde wijziging geacht te zijn aangenomen. De Secretaris-Generaal brengt het feit dat de voorgestelde wijziging is aangenomen ter kennis van alle Staten die Partij zijn.   

### Artikel  314  

####Wijzigingen van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, uitsluitend betrekking hebbende op de werkzaamheden in het Gebied

1.  Een Staat die Partij is kan door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Autoriteit, een wijziging voorstellen van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, uitsluitend betrekking hebbende op de werkzaamheden in het Gebied, met inbegrip van Bijlage VI, afdeling 4. De Secretaris-Generaal brengt een dergelijke kennisgeving over aan alle Staten die Partij zijn. De voorgestelde wijziging behoeft de goedkeuring van de Vergadering, nadat de Raad deze heeft goedgekeurd. De vertegenwoordigers van de Staten die Partij zijn in deze organen dienen te zijn gemachtigd de voorgestelde wijziging te bestuderen en goed te keuren. De voorgestelde wijziging, zoals goedgekeurd door de Raad en de Vergadering, wordt geacht te zijn aangenomen.   
2.  Voordat de Raad en de Vergadering een wijziging overeenkomstig het eerste lid goedkeuren, vergewissen zij zich ervan, dat deze geen inbreuk maakt op het stelsel van exploratie en exploitatie van de rijkdommen van het Gebied, in afwachting van de bijeenroeping van de Herzieningsconferentie overeenkomstig artikel 155.   

### Artikel  315  

####Ondertekening en bekrachtiging van, toetreding tot en authentieke teksten van wijzigingen

1.  Na de aanneming ervan staan de wijzigingen van dit Verdrag gedurende 12 maanden vanaf de datum van aanneming open voor ondertekening door de Staten die Partij zijn op de zetel van de Verenigde Naties te New York, tenzij in de wijzigingen anders wordt bepaald.

1.  De wijzigingen van dit Verdrag, niet zijnde die waarnaar wordt verwezen in het vijfde lid, treden in werking voor de Staten die Partij zijn die deze bekrachtigen of ertoe toetreden, op de dertigste dag na de nederlegging van akten van bekrachtiging of toetreding door twee derde van de Staten die Partij zijn of door 60 Staten die Partij zijn, welke van de twee het grootste aantal is. Dergelijke wijzigingen tasten noch het genot van de aan de andere Staten die Partij zijn op grond van dit Verdrag toekomende rechten, noch het nakomen van hun plichten op grond van dit Verdrag aan.   
2.  Een wijziging kan bepalen dat een groter aantal bekrachtigingen of toetredingen is vereist voor de inwerkingtreding ervan dan door dit artikel wordt vereist.   
3.  Voor elke Staat die Partij is die een wijziging, bedoeld in het eerste lid, bekrachtigt of ertoe toetreedt na de nederlegging van het vereiste aantal akten van bekrachtiging of toetreding, treedt de wijziging in werking op de dertigste dag na de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.   
4.  Een Staat die partij wordt bij dit Verdrag na de inwerkingtreding van een wijziging overeenkomstig het eerste lid wordt, indien hij geen andere bedoeling heeft kenbaar gemaakt, beschouwd als: 

a. partij bij dit Verdrag zoals het gewijzigd is; en  

b. partij bij het niet-gewijzigde Verdrag met betrekking tot iedere Staat die Partij is die niet is gebonden door de wijziging.     
5.  De wijzigingen die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de werkzaamheden in het Gebied en de wijzigingen van Bijlage VI treden voor alle Staten die Partij zijn in werking een jaar na de nederlegging van akten van bekrachtiging of toetreding door drie vierde van de Partijen.   
6.  Een Staat die Partij wordt bij dit Verdrag na de inwerkingtreding van wijzigingen overeenkomstig het vijfde lid wordt beschouwd als Partij bij dit Verdrag zoals gewijzigd.   

### Artikel  317  

####Opzegging

1.  Een Staat die Partij is kan door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, dit Verdrag opzeggen en daarbij de redenen aangeven. Het niet aangeven van redenen tast de geldigheid van de opzegging niet aan. De opzegging wordt van kracht een jaar na de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving, tenzij hierin een latere datum wordt aangegeven.   
2.  De opzegging ontheft noch een Staat van de financiële en contractuele verplichtingen, ontstaan terwijl deze Partij was bij dit Verdrag, noch tast de opzegging enig recht, enige plicht of juridische toestand aan die voor die Staat voortvloeit uit de tenuitvoerlegging van dit Verdrag vóór de buitenwerkingtreding ervan voor die Staat.   
3.  De opzegging tast in generlei wijze de plicht van iedere Staat die Partij is aan elke in dit Verdrag neergelegde verplichting na te komen, waaraan deze krachtens het internationale recht zou zijn onderworpen onafhankelijk van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  318

####COMMISSIE INZAKE DE GRENZEN VAN HET CONTINENTALE PLAT

### Artikel  1  

Overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 76 wordt in overeenstemming met de volgende artikelen een Commissie inzake de grenzen van het continentale plat dat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl, ingesteld.  

### Artikel  2  

1.  De Commissie bestaat uit 21 leden, die deskundig zijn op het gebied van de geologie, geofysica of hydrografie, door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag gekozen uit hun onderdanen, daarbij naar behoren rekening houdend met de noodzaak een billijke geografische vertegenwoordiging te waarborgen; deze leden hebben zitting in hun eigen persoonlijke hoedanigheid.   
2.  De eerste verkiezing vindt zo spoedig mogelijk plaats, doch in elk geval binnen 18 maanden na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag. Ten minste drie maanden voor de datum van elke verkiezing richt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties een brief aan de Staten die Partij zijn, waarin zij worden uitgenodigd binnen drie maanden voordrachten in te dienen, na passend regionaal overleg. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt een lijst in alfabetische volgorde op van alle aldus voorgedragen personen en legt deze voor aan alle Staten die Partij zijn.   
3.  De verkiezing van leden van de Commissie vindt plaats tijdens een bijeenkomst van de Staten die Partij zijn, bijeengeroepen door de Secretaris-Generaal ter plaatse van de hoofdzetel van de Verenigde Naties. Op die bijeenkomst, waarvoor twee derde van de Staten die Partij zijn een quorum vormen, zijn de in de Commissie verkozenen de op de voordracht staande personen, die een twee derde meerderheid verwerven van de stemmen van de vertegenwoordigers van de Staten die Partij zijn die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen. Uit elke geografische regio worden ten minste drie leden gekozen.   
4.  De leden van de Commissie worden gekozen voor een termijn van vijf jaar. Zij zijn herkiesbaar.   
5.  De Staat die Partij is, die een lid van de Commissie heeft voorgedragen, draagt de kosten van dat lid bij de uitoefening van zijn taken in de Commissie. De betrokken kuststaat draagt de kosten gemaakt met betrekking tot het advies, bedoeld in artikel 3, eerste lid, letter b, van deze Bijlage. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties zorgt voor het secretariaat.   

### Artikel  3  

1.  De taken van de Commissie zijn: 

a. het bestuderen van de door kuststaten voorgelegde gegevens en ander materiaal betreffende de buitengrenzen van het continentale plat in gebieden waar deze grenzen zich verder uitstrekken dan 200 zeemijl en het doen van aanbevelingen overeenkomstig artikel 76 en de Verklaring van Overeenstemming die op 29 augustus 1980 werd aangenomen door de Derde Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties inzake het recht van de zee;  

b. het verschaffen van wetenschappelijk en technisch advies, indien zulks door de betrokken kuststaat wordt verzocht, ten behoeve van het opstellen van de in letter a bedoelde gegevens.     
2.  De Commissie kan, in de nodig en nuttig geachte mate, samenwerken met de Intergouvernementele Oceanografische Commissie van de UNESCO, de Internationale Hydrografische Organisatie en andere bevoegde internationale organisaties ten einde wetenschappelijke en technische informatie uit te wisselen die de Commissie zou kunnen helpen bij het nakomen van haar verantwoordelijkheden.   

### Artikel  4  

Wanneer een kuststaat voornemens is, overeenkomstig artikel 76 de buitengrenzen vast te stellen van zijn continentale plat dat zich verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl, verstrekt hij, zo spoedig mogelijk, doch in elk geval binnen 10 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag voor die Staat, bijzonderheden omtrent zulke grenzen aan de Commissie, te zamen met wetenschappelijke en technische gegevens ter staving daar van. De kuststaat verstrekt tegelijkertijd de namen van Commissieleden die deze wetenschappelijk en technisch advies hebben verschaft.  

### Artikel  5  

Tenzij de Commissie anders beslist, verricht zij haar werkzaamheden door middel van subcommissies, bestaande uit zeven leden, die op evenwichtige wijze zijn benoemd, met inachtneming van de specifieke aspecten van elke door een kuststaat voorgelegde kwestie. Onderdanen van de kuststaat die het verzoek indient en die lid zijn van de Commissie en Commissieleden die een kuststaat hebben bijgestaan door het verschaffen van wetenschappelijk en technisch advies met betrekking tot het verloop van de grenslijn mogen geen lid zijn van de subcommissie die deze kwestie behandelt, maar hebben het recht als lid deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden van de Commissie met betrekking tot genoemde kwestie. De kuststaat die een verzoek bij de Commissie heeft ingediend, kan vertegenwoordigers zenden ter deelneming aan de desbetreffende werkzaamheden; deze hebben geen stemrecht.  

### Artikel  6  

1.  De subcommissie legt haar aanbevelingen voor aan de Commissie.   
2.  De goedkeuring door de Commissie van de aanbevelingen van de subcommissie geschiedt met een meerderheid van twee derde van de Commissieleden die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen.   
3.  De aanbevelingen van de Commissie worden schriftelijk medegedeeld aan de kuststaat die het verzoek heeft ingediend en aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  7  

Kuststaten stellen de buitengrenzen van het continentale plat vast in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in artikel 76, achtste lid, en overeenkomstig de desbetreffende nationale procedure.  

### Artikel  8  

Ingeval de kuststaat niet instemt met de aanbevelingen van de Commissie, dient de kuststaat binnen een redelijke termijn een herzien of nieuw verzoek in bij de Commissie.  

### Artikel  9  

Het optreden van de Commissie laat onverlet aangelegenheden betreffende de afbakening van grenzen tussen Staten met tegenover elkaar liggende of aan elkaar grenzende kusten.  

### BIJLAGE  III  

####BASISVOORWAARDEN VOOR PROSPECTIE, EXPLORATIE EN EXPLOITATIE

### Artikel  1  

####Eigendomsrecht op delfstoffen

Het eigendomsrecht op delfstoffen gaat over op het tijdstip van winning ervan overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  2  

####Prospectie

1.  

a. De Autorireit bevordert de prospectie in het Gebied.  

b. Deze wordt eerst verricht nadat de Autoriteit een Behoorlijke schriftelijke verbintenis heeft ontvangen dat de toekomstige prospector dit Verdrag en de desbetreffende regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit betreffende samenwerking bij de opleidingsprogramma's, bedoeld in de artikelen 143 en 144, en de bescherming van het mariene milieu zal naleven en de verificatie door de Autoriteit van deze naleving zal aanvaarden. De toekomstige prospector stelt tegelijkertijd de Autoriteit in kennis van de grenzen, bij benadering aangegeven, van het gebied of de gebieden waar de prospectie zal worden verricht.  

c. De prospectie kan tegelijkertijd door meer dan een prospector in hetzelfde gebied of dezelfde gebieden worden verricht.     
2.  De prospector verkrijgt uit hoofde van de prospectie geen rechten ten aanzien van de rijkdommen. Een prospector kan evenwel een redelijke hoeveelheid delfstoffen winnen voor het nemen van monsters.   

### Artikel  3  

####Exploratie en exploitatie

1.  De Onderneming, de Staten die Partij zijn en de andere lichamen, bedoeld in artikel 153, tweede lid, letter b, kunnen bij de Autoriteit een aanvrage indienen om goedkeuring van werkplannen voor werkzaamheden in het Gebied.   
2.  De Onderneming kan een aanvraag indienen met betrekking tot ongeacht welk deel van het Gebied, maar aanvragen van andere lichamen of personen met betrekking tot gereserveerde gebieden zijn onderworpen aan de aanvullende eisen van artikel 9 van deze Bijlage.   
3.  De exploratie en exploitatie worden alleen verricht in de gebieden, aangegeven in de in artikel 153, derde lid, bedoelde werkplannen, die zijn goedgekeurd door de Autoriteit overeenkomstig dit Verdrag en de desbetreffende regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.   
4.  Ieder goedgekeurd werkplan dient: 

a. in overeenstemming te zijn met dit Verdrag en de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit;  

b. te voorzien in toezicht door de Autoriteit op werkzaamheden in het Gebied overeenkomstig artikel 153, vierde lid;  

c. aan de exploitant, overeenkomstig de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, het uitsluitende recht te verlenen tot exploratie en exploitatie van de aangeduide categorieën rijkdommen in het door het werkplan bestreken gebied. Indien de aanvrager evenwel een werkplan ter goedkeuring voorlegt, dat alleen de exploratiefase of de exploitatiefase bestrijkt, verleent het goedgekeurde werkplan een zodanig uitsluitend recht alleen met betrekking tot die fase.     
5.  Na goedkeuring door de Autoriteit heeft elk werkplan, behalve dat ingediend door de Onderneming, de vorm van een contract gesloten tussen de Autoriteit en de aanvrager of aanvragers.   

### Artikel  4  

####Vereisten waaraan aanvragers moeten voldoen

1.  Andere aanvragers dan de Onderneming voldoen aan de vereisten indien zij de nationaliteit bezitten of onder toezicht staan en voor hen wordt borg gestaan, zoals vereist in artikel 153, tweede lid, letter b, en indien zij de procedures volgen en voldoen aan de normen daarvoor gesteld in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.   
2.  Behalve zoals bepaald in het zesde lid, hebben zulke normen betrekking op het financiële en technische vermogen van de aanvrager en de wijze waarop hij voorgaande contracten met de Autoriteit heeft uitgevoerd.   
3.  Voor elke aanvrager wordt borg gestaan door de Staat die Partij is en waarvan hij onderdaan is, tenzij de aanvrager meer dan één nationaliteit bezit, zoals in het geval van een deelgenootschap of consortium van lichamen uit verscheidene Staten, in welk geval alle betrokken Staten die Partij zijn, borg moeten staan voor de aanvrage, of tenzij de aanvrager onder het daadwerkelijk toezicht staat van een andere Staat die Partij is of van de onderdanen daarvan, in welk geval beide Staten die Partij zijn, borg moeten staan voor de aanvrage. De normen en procedures voor de tenuitvoerlegging van de borg zijn vervat in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.   
4.  De Staat of Staten die borg staan zijn er ingevolge artikel 139 voor verantwoordelijk dat zij, binnen hun wetsstelsel verzekeren dat een contractant waarvoor aldus borg wordt gestaan, de werkzaamheden in het Gebied verricht in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden van zijn contract en zijn verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag. Een Staat die borg staat, is evenwel niet aansprakelijk voor schade, veroorzaakt door het niet naleven door een contractant waarvoor de Staat borg staat, van diens verplichtingen, indien die Staat die Partij is wetten en voorschriften heeft aangenomen en bestuurlijke maatregelen heeft genomen die, binnen het kader van zijn wetsstelsel, redelijk passend zijn om de naleving door onder zijn rechtsmacht staande personen te verzekeren.   
5.  In de procedures voor beoordeling van de vereisten waaraan Staten die Partij zijn als aanvragers moeten voldoen, wordt rekening gehouden met hun hoedanigheid van Staat.   
6.  De normen vereisen dat elke aanvrager, zonder uitzondering, als onderdeel van zijn aanvrage zich ertoe verbindt: 

a. de verplichtingen hem opgelegd door de bepalingen van Deel XI, de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, de besluiten van de organen van de Autoriteit, en de voorwaarden van zijn contracten met de Autoriteit als afdwingbaar te aanvaarden en deze na te komen;  

b. toezicht door de Autoriteit te aanvaarden op werkzaamheden in het Gebied, zoals toegestaan door dit Verdrag;  

c. de Autoriteit de schriftelijke verzekering te verstrekken dat hij zijn verplichtingen krachtens het contract te goeder trouw zal vervullen;  

d. de bepalingen inzake de overdracht van technologie vervat in artikel 5 van deze Bijlage na te leven.     

### Artikel  5  

####Overdracht van technologie

1.  Bij de indiening van een werkplan dient elke aanvrager de Autoriteit een algemene beschrijving ter beschikking te stellen van de te gebruiken uitrusting en methoden bij het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied, alsmede andere van belang zijnde informatie waarop geen industriële eigendomsrechten rusten, over de kenmerken van zulke technologie, alsook informatie waar zulke technologie beschikbaar is.   
2.  Iedere exploitant stelt de Autoriteit in kennis van herzieningen in de beschrijvingen informatie die ingevolge het eerste lid ter beschikking zijn gesteld, telkens wanneer een belangrijke technologische verandering of innovatie wordt ingevoerd.   
3.  Ieder contract voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied bevat de onderstaande verbintenissen van de zijde van de contractant: 

a. op verzoek van de Autoriteit, op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen aan de Onderneming de technologie ter beschikking te stellen, waarvan hij gebruik maakt bij het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied krachtens het contract, en welke de contractant gerechtigd is over te dragen. Dit geschiedt door middel van licenties of andere passende regelingen, over de totstandkoming waarvan de contractant onderhandelt met de Onderneming en die worden neergelegd in een afzonderlijke overeenkomst ter aanvulling van het contract. Op deze verbintenis kan slechts een beroep worden gedaan, indien de Onderneming constateert dat zij niet in staat is op de open markt dezelfde of even doeltreffende en nuttige technologie te verkrijgen op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen;  

b. een schriftelijke verzekering te verkrijgen van de eigenaar van technologie die wordt gebruikt bij het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied krachtens het contract, welke technologie niet algemeen beschikbaar is op de open markt en niet valt onder letter a, dat de eigenaar, op verzoek van de Autoriteit, deze technologie in licentie of volgens andere passende regelingen en op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen aan de Onderneming ter beschikking zal stellen in dezelfde mate als zij beschikbaar is gesteld aan de contractant. Indien deze verzekering niet is verkregen, mag de desbetreffende technologie niet door de contractant worden gebruikt bij het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied;  

c. op verzoek van de Onderneming en indien het mogelijk is zulks te doen zonder aanmerkelijke kosten voor de contractant door middel van een executoriaal contract, van de eigenaar het recht te werven tot overdracht aan de Onderneming van door de contractant gebruikte technologie bij het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied krachtens het contract, die de contractant anderszins niet gerechtigd is over te dragen en die niet algemeen beschikbaar is op de open markt. Indien er binnen eenzelfde maatschappij een wezenlijke band bestaat tussen de contractant en de eigenaar van de technologie, dient rekening te worden gehouden met de vraag hoe nauw deze band is, alsmede met de mate van toezicht of invloed, bij de vaststelling of alle mogelijke maatregelen zijn genomen om zulk een recht te verwerven. Indien de contractant daadwerkelijk toezicht op de eigenaar uitoefent en dit recht niet van de eigenaar vermag te verwerven, dient met dit feit rekening te worden gehouden bij de vaststelling of de contractant voldoet aan de eisen voor daaropvolgende aanvragen om goedkeuring van een werkplan;  

d. op verzoek van de Onderneming de verwerving door de Onderneming te vergemakkelijken van technologie vallend onder letter b, onder licentie of volgens andere passende regelingen en op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen, indien de Onderneming besluit rechtstreeks met de eigenaar van de technologie te onderhandelen;  

e. dezelfde maatregelen te nemen als zijn voorgeschreven in de letters a, b, c en d, ten behoeve van een ontwikkelingsstaat of groep van ontwikkelingsstaten die krachtens artikel 9 van deze Bijlage een contract heeft aangevraagd, mits deze maatregelen beperkt zijn tot de exploitatie van het gedeelte van het door de contractant beoogde gebied dat ingevolge artikel 8 van deze Bijlage is gereserveerd en mits werkzaamheden op grond van het contract waarom door de ontwikkelingsstaat of groep van ontwikkelingsstaten wordt verzocht, niet de overdracht met zich brengt van technologie aan een derde Staat of de onderdanen van een derde Staat. De verplichting krachtens deze bepaling geldt alleen dan met betrekking tot een bepaalde contractant, wanneer niet om de technologie is verzocht door de Onderneming of de technologie niet door die contractant aan de Onderneming is overgedragen.     
4.  Geschillen betreffende de in het derde lid vereiste verbintenissen, alsook betreffende andere bepalingen van het contract, zijn onderworpen aan verplichte regeling overeenkomstig Deel XI en, in gevallen van schending van deze verbintenissen, kan zulks leiden tot schorsing of beëindiging van het contract of de oplegging van geldstraffen overeenkomstig artikel 18 van deze Bijlage. Geschillen over de vraag of door de contractant gedane aanbiedingen binnen het kader van billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen vallen, kunnen door elk der partijen worden voorgelegd aan bindende commerciële arbitrage overeenkomstig de arbitrageregels van UNCITRAL of andere arbitrageregels die kunnen worden voorgeschreven in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit. Indien de uitspraak is dat de door de contractant gedane aanbieding niet valt binnen het kader van billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen, krijgt de contractant 45 dagen tijd om zijn aanbieding te herzien ten einde deze binnen dit kader te brengen, alvorens de Autoriteit stappen onderneemt overeenkomstig artikel 18 van deze Bijlage.   
5.  Indien de Onderneming niet in staat is op billijke en redelijke voorwaarden en bedingen passende technologie te verwerven ten einde op een geschikt tijdstip een aanvang te kunnen maken met de winning en be- en verwerking van delfstoffen uit het Gebied, kan de Raad of de Vergadering een groep van Staten die Partij zijn bijeenroepen, bestaande uit de Staten die zich bezighouden met werkzaamheden in het Gebied, de Staten die borg staan voor de lichamen die zich bezighouden met werkzaamheden in het Gebied en andere Staten die Partij zijn die toegang hebben tot zodanige technologie. Deze groep pleegt onderling overleg en neemt doeltreffende maatregelen om te verzekeren dat zodanige technologie aan de Onderneming ter beschikking wordt gesteld op billijke en redelijke commerciële voorwaarden en bedingen. Elk van deze Staten die Partij is, neemt hiertoe binnen zijn eigen wetsstelsel alle in de praktijk mogelijke maatregelen.   
6.  In het geval van „joint ventures” met de Onderneming, geschiedt de overdracht van technologie overeenkomstig de voorwaarden van de overeenkomst inzake de „joint-venture”.   
7.  De in het derde lid vereiste verbintenissen worden opgenomen in elk contract voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied tot 10 jaar na de aanvang van de commerciële produktie door de Onderneming; gedurende deze periode kan daarop een beroep worden gedaan.   
8.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel betekent „technologie” de gespecialiseerde uitrusting en know-how, met inbegrip van handboeken, ontwerpen, gebruiksaanwijzingen, opleiding en technisch advies en technische bijstand, nodig voor de assemblage, het onderhoud en de werking van een levensvatbaar systeem, en het recht van dit alles hiertoe een niet-exclusief gebruik te maken.   

### Artikel  6  

####Goedkeuring van werkplannen

1.  Zes maanden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag en elke vierde maand daarna bestudeert de Autoriteit de voorgestelde werkplannen.   
2.  Bij de bestudering van een aanvrage om goedkeuring van een werkplan in de vorm van een contract gaat de Autoriteit eerst na of: 

a. de aanvrager heeft voldaan aan de overeenkomstig artikel 4 van deze Bijlage vastgestelde procedure en de Autoriteit de verbintenissen en verzekeringen heeft verstrekt die in dat artikel worden vereist. Ingeval niet aan deze procedures is voldaan of indien één van deze verbintenissen of verzekeringen ontbreekt, krijgt de aanvrager 45 dagen om deze gebreken te corrigeren;  

b. de aanvrager voldoet aan de vereisten, bedoeld in artikel 4 van deze Bijlage.     
3.  Alle voorgestelde werkplannen worden bestudeerd in de volgorde waarin zij zijn ontvangen. De voorgestelde werkplannen moeten voldoen aan en zijn onderworpen aan de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit Verdrag en de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, met inbegrip van die inzake operationele vereisten, financiële bijdragen en verbintenissen betreffende de overdracht van technologie. Indien de voorgestelde werkplannen aan deze vereisten voldoen, hecht de Autoreiteit haar goedkeuring daaraan, mits zij in overeenstemming zijn met de eenvormige en non-discriminatoire vereisten, vervat in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, tenzij: 

a. een deel van het gebied of het gehele gebied waarop het voorgestelde werkplan betrekking heeft, is begrepen in een goedgekeurd werkplan of een eerder voorgelegd voorgesteld werkplan, waarover de Autoriteit nog geen definitieve beslissing heeft genomen;  

b. een deel van het gebied of het gehele gebied waarop het voorgestelde werkplan betrekking heeft door de Autoriteit is uitgesloten ingevolge artikel 162, tweede lid, letter x; of  

c. het voorgestelde werkplan is ingediend of ervoor wordt borg gestaan door een Staat die Partij is die reeds in het bezit is van: 

(i) werkplannen voor de exploratie en exploitatie van metaalknollen in niet-gereserveerde gebieden die, te zamen met ongeacht welk van de delen van het gebied waarop de aanvrage voor een werkplan betrekking heeft, in omvang groter zijn dan 30 procent van een cirkelg gebied met een oppervlakte van 400.000 vierkante kilometer rond het centrum van ongeacht welk van beide delen van het gebied waarop het voorgestelde werkplan betrekking heeft;  

(ii) werkplannen voor de exploratie en exploitatie van metaalknollen in niet-gereserveerde gebieden die, te zamen genomen, 2 procent vormen van de totale zeebodem die niet is gereserveerd, of waarvan de exploitatie niet is uitgesloten ingevolge artikel 162, tweede lid, letter x.       
4.  Voor de toepassing van de norm, vervat in het derde lid, letter c, wordt een door een deelgenootschap of consortium ingediend werkplan pro rata toegerekend aan de Staten die Partij zijn, die borg staan, en erbij betrokken zijn overeenkomstig artikel 4, derde lid, van deze Bijlage. De Autoriteit kan werkplannen, vallend onder het derde lid, letter c, goedkeuren indien zij vaststelt dat zulk een goedkeuring het niet mogelijk maakt dat een Staat die Partij is of lichamen waarvoor deze Staat borg staat het verrichten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied monopoliseert/ monopoliseren of andere Staten die Partij zijn uitsluit/uitsluiten van werkzaamheden in het Gebied.   
5.  Niettegenstaande het derde lid, letter a, kan de Autoriteit na het einde van de overgangsperiode, aangegeven in artikel 151, derde lid, door middel van regels, voorschriften en procedures andere met dit Verdrag verenigbare procedures en criteria aannemen, voor de beslissing van welke aanvragers werkplannen worden goedgekeurd in gevallen van keuze tussen aanvragers voor een voorgesteld gebied. Deze procedures en criteria verzekeren de goedkeuring van werkplannen op billijke en non-discriminatoire grondslag.   

### Artikel  7  

####Keuze uit aanvragers van produktievergunningen

1.  Zes maanden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag en elke vierde maand daarna bestudeert de Autoriteit de in de onmiddellijk daaraan voorafgaande periode ingediende aanvragen om een produktievergunning. De Autoriteit verleent de aangevraagde vergunningen indien al deze aanvragen kunnen worden goedgekeurd zonder de produktiegrens te overschrijden of inbreuk te maken op verplichtingen van de Autoriteit krachtens een grondstoffenovereenkomst of -regeling waarbij zij partij is geworden zoals bedoeld in artikel 151.   
2.  Wanneer uit de aanvragers van produktievergunningen een keuze moet worden gemaakt wegens de in artikel 151, tweede tot en met zevende lid, vastgestelde produktiegrens of wegens de verplichtingen van de Autoriteit krachtens een grondstoffenovereenkomst of -regeling waarbij zij partij is geworden, zoals bepaald in artikel 151, eerste lid, verricht de Autoriteit de keuze op basis van objectieve en non-discriminatoire normen, vervat in haar regels, voorschriften en procedures.   
3.  Bij de toepassing van het tweede lid geeft de Autoriteit de voorrang aan die aanvragers die: 

a. een betere garantie van doelmatigheid geven, gezien hun financiële en technische vermogen en de wijze waarop zij eventueel eerder goedgekeurde werkplannen hebben uitgevoerd;  

b. eerder vooruitzicht op financiële voordelen voor de Autoriteit bieden, rekening houdend met de datum als voorzien voor de aanvang van de commerciële produktie;  

c. reeds de meeste middelen in prospectie en exploratie hebben geïnvesteerd, en de grootste inspanningen daarvoor hebben verricht.     
4.  Aanvragers die in een bepaalde periode niet zijn gekozen hebben in volgende perioden voorrang totdat zij een produktievergunning ontvangen.   
5.  De keuze geschiedt met inachtneming van de noodzaak alle Staten die Partij zijn ruimere mogelijkheden te bieden deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden in het Gebied en van de noodzaak monopolisering van deze werkzaamheden te voorkomen, en wel ongeacht het sociale en economische stelsel of de geografische ligging van deze Staten, ten einde discriminatie ten aanzien van een Staat of stelsel te vermijden.   
6.  Wanneer minder gereserveerde gebieden dan niet-gereserveerde gebieden worden geëxploiteerd, hebben aanvragen om produktievergunningen met betrekking tot gereserveerde gebieden voorrang.   
7.  De in dit artikel bedoelde beslissingen worden zo spoedig mogelijk na de afloop van elk tijdvak genomen.   

### Artikel  8  

####Reservering van gebieden

Elke andere aanvrage dan die welke door de Onderneming of door andere lichamen wordt ingediend voor gereserveerde gebieden, dient een totaal gebied te bestrijken, dat niet uit één geheel behoeft te bestaan en dat groot genoeg is en voldoende geschatte commerciële waarde bezit om twee mijnbouwoperaties mogelijk te maken. De aanvrager dient de coördinaten aan te geven die het gebied verdelen in twee delen van gelijke geschatte commerciële waarde en alle door hem verkregen gegevens met betrekking tot beide delen over te leggen. Onverminderd de bevoegdheden van de Autoriteit ingevolge artikel 17 van deze Bijlage dienen de over te leggen gegevens betreffende metaalknollen betrekking te hebben op het in kaart brengen en het nemen van monsters ervan, de rijkdom aan metaalknollen en het metaalgehalte. Binnen 45 dagen na ontvangst van zodanige gegevens wijst de Autoriteit aan, welk deel dient te worden gereserveerd voor het verrichten van werkzaamheden door de Autoriteit via de Onderneming of te zamen met ontwikkelingsstaten. Deze aanwijzing kan worden uitgesteld voor nogmaals een tijdvak van 45 dagen indien de Autoriteit een onafhankelijke deskundige verzoekt na te gaan of alle krachtens dit artikel vereiste gegevens zijn overgelegd. Het aangewezen gebied wordt een gereserveerd gebied zodra het werkplan voor het niet-gereserveerde gebied is goedgekeurd en het contract is ondertekend.  

### Artikel  9  

####Werkzaamheden in gereserveerde gebieden

1.  De Onderneming wordt de gelegenheid geboden te beslissen of zij voornemens is werkzaamheden in elk gereserveerd gebied te verrichten. Deze beslissing kan te allen tijde worden genomen tenzij de Autoriteit een kennisgeving ingevolge het vierde lid ontvangt, in welk geval de Onderneming binnen een redelijke tijd een beslissing dient te nemen. De Onderneming kan beslissen zulke gebieden te exploiteren in „joint ventures” met de belangstellende Staat of het belangstellende lichaam.   
2.  De Onderneming kan contracten sluiten voor de uitvoering van een deel van haar werkzaamheden overeenkomstig Bijlage IV, artikel 12. Zij kan ook „joint ventures” aangaan voor het verrichten van zulke werkzaamheden met lichamen die ingevolge artikel 153, tweede lid, letter b, gerechtigd zijn werkzaamheden in het Gebied te verrichten. Wanneer de Onderneming zulke „joint ventures” overweegt, biedt zij aan Staten die Partij zijn, die ontwikkelingsstaten zijn en aan hun onderdanen de mogelijkheid van daadwerkelijke deelneming aan.   
3.  De Autoriteit kan in haar regels, voorschriften en procedures inhoudelijke en procedurele vereisten en voorwaarden voorschrijven met betrekking tot zodanige contracten en „joint ventures”.   
4.  Een Staat die Partij is en die een ontwikkelingsstaat is of een natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon waarvoor deze borg staat en die onder het daadwerkelijk toezicht staat van deze Staat of van een andere ontwikkelingsstaat die een aan de voorwaarden voldoende aanvrager is, of een groep van voornoemde categorieën, kan de Autoriteit ervan in kennis stellen dat hij een werkplan ingevolge artikel 6 van deze Bijlage wenst in te dienen met betrekking tot een gereserveerd gebied. Dit werkplan wordt nader bezien, indien de Onderneming ingevolge het eerste lid beslist dat zij niet voornemens is werkzaamheden in dat gebied te verrichten.   

### Artikel  10  

####Voorkeur en voorrang onder aanvragers

Een exploitant die een goedgekeurd werkplan voor alleen exploratie heeft, zoals bepaald in artikel 3, vierde lid, letter c, van deze Bijlage, geniet voorkeuren voorrang onder de aanvragers voor een werkplan dat de exploitatie van hetzelfde gebied en dezelfde rijkdommen betreft. Een zodanige voorkeur kan evenwel worden ingetrokken, indien de prestatie van de exploitant niet bevredigend is geweest.  

### Artikel  11  

####Overeenkomsten tot gezamenlijke onderneming

1.  Contracten kunnen voorzien in overeenkomsten tot gezamenlijke onderneming tussen de contractant en de Autoriteit, handelend via de Onderneming, in de vorm van „joint ventures” of deling van de produktie, alsook andere vormen van overeenkomsten tot gezamenlijke onderneming, die dezelfde bescherming genieten tegen herziening, schorsing of beëindiging als contracten met de Autoriteit.   
2.  Contractanten die zulke overeenkomsten tot gezamenlijke onderneming met de Onderneming aangaan, kunnen financiële stimulansen ontvangen zoals bepaald in artikel 13 van deze Bijlage.   
3.  Deelgenoten in „joint ventures” met de Onderneming zijn aansprakelijk voor de betalingen, vereist in artikel 13 van deze Bijlage, naar rato van hun aandeel in de „joint ventures”, onder voorbehoud van de financiële stimulansen, bedoeld in dat artikel.   

### Artikel  12  

####Door de Onderneming verrichte werkzaamheden

1.  Ingevolge artikel 153, tweede lid, letter a, door de Onderneming in het Gebied verrichte werkzaamheden, vallen onder het bepaalde in Deel XI, de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit en haar desbetreffende besluiten.   
2.  Door de Onderneming ingediende werkplannen dienen vergezeld te gaan van stukken waaruit haar financiële en technische vermogen blijkt.   

### Artikel  13  

####Financiële voorwaarden van contracten

1.  Bij het aannemen van regels, voorschriften en procedures betreffende de financiële voorwaarden van een contract tussen de Autoriteit en de in artikel 153, tweede lid, letter b, bedoelde lichamen, en bij het onderhandelen over deze financiële voorwaarden overeenkomstig Deel XI en die regels, voorschriften en procedures, wordt de Autoriteit geleid door de volgende doelstellingen: 

a. optimale inkomsten voor de Autoriteit te verzekeren uit de opbrengst van commerciële produktie;  

b. investeringen en technologie aan te trekken voor de exploratie en exploitatie van het Gebied;  

c. gelijkheid van behandeling in financieel opzicht en vergelijkbare financiële verplichtingen voor contractanten te verzekeren;  

d. op eenvormige en non-discriminatoire wijze stimulansen te bieden aan contractanten, opdat dezen overeenkomsten tot gezamenlijke onderneming aangaan met de Onderneming en ontwikkelingsstaten of onderdanen daarvan, de overdracht van technologie daaraan stimuleren en het personeel van de Autoriteit en van ontwikkelingsstaten opleiden;  

e. de Onderneming in staat te stellen, zich daadwerkelijk met diepzeemijnbouw bezig te houden op hetzelfde tijdstip als de lichamen, bedoeld in artikel 153, tweede lid, letter b; en  

f. te verzekeren dat de contractanten niet, als gevolg van de krachtens het veertiende lid aan contractanten geboden stimulansen, op grond van de voorwaarden van contracten die worden herzien overeenkomstig artikel 19 van deze Bijlage of op grond van de bepalingen van artikel 11 van deze Bijlage met betrekking tot „joint ventures”, worden gesubsidieerd zodat zij een kunstmatig concurrentievoordeel verkrijgen tegenover degenen die zich met de mijnbouw op het vasteland bezighouden.     
2.  Er dient een heffing te worden betaald voor de administratieve kosten van de behandeling van een aanvrage om goedkeuring van een werkplan in de vorm van een contract; deze heffing is vastgesteld op US $500.000 per aanvrage. Het bedrag van de heffing wordt van tijd tot tijd door de Raad opnieuw bezien ten einde te verzekeren dat de gemaakte administratieve kosten daardoor worden gedekt. Indien de door de Autoriteit bij de behandeling van een aanvrage gemaakte administratieve kosten lager zijn dan het vastgestelde bedrag, betaalt de Autoriteit het verschil terug aan de aanvrager.   
3.  Van de datum van inwerkingtreding van het contract betaalt een contractant een jaarlijkse vaste heffing van US $ 1 miljoen. Indien de goedgekeurde datum van aanvang van de commerciële produktie wordt uitgesteld wegens vertraging in de afgifte van de produktievergunning, overeenkomstig artikel 151, is de jaarlijkse vaste heffing niet verschuldigd voor het tijdvak van uitstel. Vanaf de aanvangsdatum van de commerciële produktie betaalt de contractant de cijns of de jaarlijkse vaste heffing, naargelang welke van beide de hoogste is.   
4.  Binnen een jaar na de aanvangsdatum van de commerciële produktie in overeenstemming met het derde lid, dient een contractant te kiezen of hij zijn financiële bijdrage aan de Autoriteit wenst te voldoen door: 

a. alleen een cijns te betalen; of  

b. een combinatie te betalen van een cijns en een aandeel in de netto opbrengst.     
5.  

a. Indien een contractant verkiest zijn financiële bijdrage aan de Autoriteit te voldoen door alleen een cijns te betalen, wordt deze vastgesteld op een percentage van de marktwaarde van de be- en verwerkte metalen, voortgebracht uit de metaalknollen die worden gewonnen uit het door het contract bestreken gebied. Dit percentage wordt als volgt vastgesteld:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| (i)  | eerste t/m tiende jaar van commerciële produktie  | 5 procent  |
| (ii)  | elfde jaar tot einde van commerciële produktie  | 12 procent.  |

b. De bedoelde marktwaarde is het produkt van de hoeveelheid been verwerkte metalen afkomstig uit de metaalknollen, gewonnen uit het door het contract bestreken gebied en de gemiddelde prijs voor die metalen tijdens het desbetreffende boekjaar, zoals omschreven in het zevende en achtste lid.     
6.  Indien een contractant verkiest zijn financiële bijdrage aan de Autoriteit te voldoen door de betaling van een combinatie van een cijns en een aandeel in de netto opbrengst, worden deze betalingen als volgt bepaald: 

a. De cijns wordt vastgesteld op een percentage van de marktwaarde, bepaald overeenkomstig letter b, van de be- en verwerkte metalen afkomstig uit de metaalknollen die uit het door het contract bestreken gebied worden gewonnen. Dit percentage wordt als volgt vastgesteld:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| (i)  | eerste tijdvak van commerciële produktie  | 2 procent  |
| (ii)  | tweede tijdvak van commerciële produktie  | 4 procent  |

Indien in het tweede tijdvak van commerciële produktie, zoals omschreven in letter d, het rendement van de investeringen in enig boekjaar zoals omschreven in letter m daalt tot beneden 15 procent ten gevolge van de betaling van de cijns van 4 procent, wordt de cijns in dat boekjaar 2 procent in plaats van 4 procent.  

b. De bedoelde marktwaarde is het produkt van de hoeveelheid been verwerkte metalen afkomstig uit de metaalknollen, gewonnen uit het door het contract bestreken gebied, en de gemiddelde prijs voor die metalen tijdens het desbetreffende boekjaar zoals omschreven in het zevende en achtste lid.  

c. 

(i) Het aandeel van de Autoriteit in de netto opbrengst wordt onttrokken aan dat deel van de netto opbrengst van de contractant dat kan worden toegerekend aan de diepzeemijnbouw van de rijkdommen van het door het contract bestreken gebied, hierna te noemen de toe te rekenen netto opbrengst.  

(ii) Het aandeel van de Autoriteit in de netto opbrengst wordt bepaald overeenkomstig de onderstaande glijdende schaal:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|---|---|---|
| Deel van netto opbrengst  | Aandeel van de Autoriteit  |
| Eerste tijdvak van commerciële produktie  | Tweede tijdvak van commerciële produktie  |
| Dat deel dat een rendement op de investering vertegenwoordigt dat hoger is dan 0 procent, doch lager dan 10 procent  | 35 procent  | 40 procent  |
| Dat deel dat een rendement op de investering vertegenwoordigt dat 10 procent of hoger is, doch lager dan 20 procent  | 42,5 procent  | 50 procent  |
| Dat deel dat een rendement op de investering vertegenwoordigt dat 20 procent of hoger is  | 50 procent  | 70 procent  |

d. 

(i) Het in de letters a ene bedoelde eerste tijdvak van commerciële produktie vangt aan in het eerste boekjaar van de commerciële produktie en eindigt in het boekjaar waarin de ontginningskosten van de contractant met rente over het nog niet afgeschreven deel daarvan, volledig worden afgeschreven ten laste van zijn kasoverschot, en wel als volgt: In het eerste boekjaar waarin ontginningskosten worden gemaakt, zijn de nog niet afgeschreven ontginningskosten gelijk aan de ontginningskosten verminderd met het kasoverschot in dat jaar. In elk volgend boekjaar zijn de nog niet afgeschreven ontginningskosten gelijk aan de et afgeschreven ontginningskosten aan het einde van het voorgaande boekjaar, vermeerderd met rente daarover van 10 procent per jaar, vermeerderd met de in het lopende boekjaar gemaakte ontginningskosten en verminderd met het kasoverschot van de contractant in het lopende boekjaar. Het boekjaar waarin de nog niet afgeschreven ontnningskosten voor de eerste maal de waarde nul bereiken, is het boekjaar waarin de ontginningskosten van de contractant met rente over et afgeschreven gedeelte daarvan, volledig worden afgeschreven ten laste van zijn kasoverschot. Het kasoverschot van de contractant in enig boekjaar is zijn bruto opbrengst verminderd met zijn exploitatiekosten en verminderd met zijn betalingen aan de Autoriteit ingevolge letter c.  

(ii) Het tweede tijdvak van commerciële produktie vangt aan in het boekjaar na afloop van het eerste tijdvak van commerciële produktie en loopt tot het einde van het contract.    

e. „Netto opbrengs” betekent het produkt van de netto opbrengst van de contractant en de verhouding tussen de ontginningskosten in de mijnbouwsector en de ontginningskosten van de contractant. Indien de contractant zich bezighoudt met de diepzeemijnbouw, het vervoer van metaalknollen en de produktie van voornamelijk drie be- en verwerkte metalen, namelijk kobalt, koper en nikkel, is het bedrag van de netto opbrengst niet minder dan 25 procent van de netto opbrengst van de contractant. Onder voorbehoud van letter n kan de Autoriteit, in alle andere gevallen, met inbegrip van die waarin de contractant zich bezighoudt met de diepzeemijnbouw, het vervoer van metaalknollen en de produktie van voornamelijk vier be- en verwerkte metalen, namelijk kobalt, koper, mangaan en nikkel, in haar regels, voorschriften en procedures passende minima voorschrijven die in dezelfde relatie tot elk geval zullen staan, als het minimum van 25 procent staat in het geval van de drie metalen.  

f. „Netto opbrengst van de contractant” betekent de bruto opbrengst van de contractant verminderd met zijn exploitatiekosten en verminderd met de afschrijving van zijn ontginningskosten zoals uiteengezet in letter j.  

g. 

(i) Indien de contractant zich bezighoudt met de diepzeemijnbouw, het vervoer van metaalknollen en de produktie van be- en verwerkte metalen, betekent „bruto opbrengst van de contractant” de bruto opbrengst uit de verkoop van de be- en verwerkte metalen en alle andere gelden die overeenkomstig de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit redelijkerwijze kunnen worden toegerekend aan de exploitatie krachtens het contract.  

(ii) in alle andere gevallen dan die aangegeven in de letters g (i) en n, betekent „bruto opbrengst van de contractant” de bruto opbrengst uit de verkoop van half-bewerkte metalen uit de metaalknollen gewonnen uit het door het contract bestreken gebied en alle andere gelden die overeenkomstig de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit redelijkerwijze kunnen worden toegerekend aan de exploitatie krachtens het contract.    

h. „Ontginningskosten van de contractant” betekent: 

(i) alle kosten gemaakt vóór de aanvang van de commerciële produke die rechtstreeks samenhangen met de ontwikkeling van het produktieve vermogen van het door het contract bestreken gebied en de daarmede samenhangende werkzaamheden voor exploitatie krachtens het contract in alle andere gevallen dan die aangegeven in letter n, in overeenstemming met de algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen, met inbegrip van onder meer de kosten van uitrusting en materieel, schepen, been verwerkingsinstallaties, bouwwerkzaamheden, gebouwen, grond, wegen, prospectie en exploratie van het door het contract bestreken gebied, van onderzoek en ontwikkeling, rente, vereiste huurcontracten, licenties en rechten; en  

(ii) soortgelijke uitgaven als die vervat in (i) hierboven, gemaakt na de aanvang van de commerciële produktie en nodig ter uitvoering van het werkplan, behalve die welke tot de exploitatiekosten moeten worden gerekend.    

i. De inkomsten uit de vervreemding van kapitaalgoederen en de marktwaarde van die kapitaalgoederen die niet langer nodig zijn voor de exploitatie krachtens het contract en die niet worden verkocht, worden in mindering gebracht op de ontginningskosten van de contractant tijdens het desbetreffende boekjaar. Wanneer deze minderingen groter zijn dan de ontginningskosten van de contractant, wordt dit verschil geteld bij de bruto opbrengst van de contractant.  

j. De ontginningskosten van de contractant, gemaakt voor de aanvang van de commerciële produktie, bedoeld in de letters h (i) en n (iv) worden afgeschreven in tien gelijke termijnen vanaf de datum van aanvang van de commerciële produktie. De ontginningskosten van de contractant, gemaakt na de aanvang van de commerciële produktie, bedoeld in de letters h (ii) en n (iv), worden afgeschreven in tien of minder gelijke jaarlijkse termijnen, ten einde de volledige afschrijving ervan aan het einde van het contract te verzekeren.  

k. „Exploitatiekosten van de contractant” betekent alle kosten, gemaakt na de aanvang van de commerciële produktie bij de exploitatie van het produktief vermogen van het door het contract bestreken gebied en de daarmede samenhangende werkzaamheden voor exploitatie krachtens het contract, in overeenstemming met algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen, met inbegrip van onder meer, de jaarlijkse vaste heffing of de cijns, naargelang welke van beide de hoogste is, uitgaven voor lonen, salarissen, toelagen aan werknemers, materialen, diensten, vervoer, be- en verwerkingskosten en afzetkosten, rente, betalingen aan openbare nutsbedrijven, bescherming van het mariene milieu, algemene en administratieve kosten die uitdrukkelijk samenhangen met de exploitatie krachtens het contract en netto exploitatieverliezen die worden overgeheveld zoals hierin nader aangegeven. Netto exploitatieverliezen kunnen twee achtereenvolgende jaren worden overgeheveld, behalve in de laatste twee jaar van het contract, in welk geval zij kunnen worden overgeheveld naar de voorgaande twee jaar.  

l. Indien de contractant zich bezighoudt met de diepzeemijnbouw en het vervoer van metaalknollen en de produktie van gedeeltelijk bewerkte en van be- en verwerkte metalen, betekent „ontginningskosten van de diepzeemijnbouwsector” het gedeelte van de ontginningskosten van de contractant dat rechtstreeks samenhangt met de diepzeemijnbouw van de rijkdommen van het door het contract bestreken gebied, in overeenstemming met algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen en met de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, met inbegrip van onder meer, de aanvraagheffing, de jaarlijkse vaste heffing en waar van toepassing, de kosten van prospectie in en exploratie van het door het contract bestreken gebied en een gedeelte van de kosten van onderzoek en ontwikkeling.  

m. ,,Rendement op investering” in enig boekjaar betekent de verhouding tussen de netto opbrengst in dat jaar en de ontginningskosten van de diepzeemijnbouwsector. Voor de berekening van deze verhouding omvatten de ontginningskosten van de diepzeemijnbouwsector, uitgaven voor nieuwe of vervangende uitrusting in de diepzeemijnbouwsector, verminderd met de oorspronkelijke kosten van de vervangen uitrusting.  

n. Indien de contractant zich alleen met diepzeemijnbouw bezighoudt: 

(i) betekent „netto opbrengst” alle netto opbrengsten van de contractant;  

(ii) heeft de „netto opbrengst van de contractant” de betekenis zoals omschreven in letter f;  

(iii) betekent „bruto opbrengst van de contractant” de bruto opbrengst uit de verkoop van metaalknollen en alle andere gelden die overeenkomstig de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit redelijkerwijze kunnen worden toegerekend aan de exploitatie krachtens het contract;  

(iv) betekent „ontginningskosten van de contractant” alle kosten, gemaakt vóór de aanvang van de commerciële produktie zoals vervat in letter h (i), en alle kosten, gemaakt na de aanvang van de commerciële produktie zoals vervat in letter h (ii), die rechtstreeks samenhangen met de diepzeemijnbouw van de rijkdommen van het door het contract bestreken gebied, in overeenstemming met algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen;  

(v) betekent „exploitatiekosten van de contractant” de exploitatiekosten van de contractant zoals vervat in letter k, die rechtstreeks samenhangen met de diepzeemijnbouw van de rijkdommen van het door het contract bestreken gebied, in overeenstemming met algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen;  

(vi) betekent „rendement op investering” in enig boekjaar de verhouding tussen de netto opbrengst van de contractant in dat jaar en de ontginningskosten van de contractant. Voor de berekening van deze verhouding omvatten de ontginningskosten van de contractant uitgaven voor nieuwe of vervangende uitrusting, verminderd met de oorspronkelijke kosten van de vervangen uitrusting.    

o. De in de letters h, k,l en n bedoelde kosten met betrekking tot door de contractant betaalde rente, worden in mindering gebracht voor zover, in alle omstandigheden, de Autoriteit ingevolge artikel 4, eerste lid van deze Bijlage, de verhouding tussen vreemd en eigen vermogen en de rentepercentages goedkeurt als redelijk, bestaand goed koopmansgebruik in aanmerking genomen.  

p. De in dit lid bedoelde kosten worden niet uitgelegd als omvattende betalingen van inkomstenbelasting door maatschappijen of van soortgelijke heffingen, opgelegd door Staten met betrekking tot de activiteiten van de contractant.     
7.  

a. „Be- en verwerkte metalen” als bedoeld in het vijfde en zesde lid, betekent de metalen in de meest gangbare vorm waarin zij gewoonlijk op internationale termijnmarkten worden verhandeld. Hiertoe geeft de Autoriteit in haar financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures de desbetreffende internationale termijnmarkt aan. Voor de metalen die niet op zulke markten worden verhandeld betekent ,,be- en verwerkte metalen de metalen in de meest gangbare vorm waarin zij gewoonlijk worden verhandeld in representatieve transacties tussen niet gelieerde partijen.  

b. Indien de Autoriteit niet op andere wijze de hoeveelheid be- en verwerkte metalen voortgebracht uit de metaalknollen gewonnen uit het door het contract bedoeld in het vijfde lid, letter b, en het zesde lid, letter b, bestreken gebied kan bepalen, wordt de hoeveelheid bepaald op basis van het metaalgehalte van de knollen, het bewerkingsrendement voor de extractie van de metalen en andere van belang zijnde factoren, zulks overeenkomstig de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit en in overeenstemming met algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen.     
8.  Indien een internationale termijnmarkt een representatief prijsstellingsmechanisme voor be- en verwerkte metalen, metaalknollen en gedeeltelijk bewerkte metalen uit de knollen biedt, wordt de gemiddelde prijs op die markt gehanteerd. In alle andere gevallen bepaalt de Autoriteit, na raadpleging van de contractant, een billijke prijs voor deze produkten overeenkomstig het negende lid. 

a. Alle kosten, uitgaven, opbrengsten en inkomsten en alle bepalingen van prijs en waarde, bedoeld in dit artikel zijn het resultaat van transacties op de vrije markt of transacties tussen niet-gelieerde partijen. Bij gebreke daarvan, worden zij door de Autoriteit bepaald, na raadpleging van de contractant, als waren zij het resultaat van transacties op de vrije markt of tussen niet-gelieerde partijen, met inachtneming van desbetreffende transacties op andere markten.  

b. Ten einde naleving van en handhaving van de bepalingen van dit lid te verzekeren, wordt de Autoriteit geleid door de beginselen, aangenomen voor, en de uitlegging gegeven aan transacties tussen niet-gelieerde partijen door de Commissie inzake Transnationale Ondernemingen van de Verenigde Naties, de Groep deskundigen inzake belastingverdragen tussen ontwikkelingslanden en ontwikkelde landen en andere internationale organisaties en geeft zij, in haar regels, voorschriften en procedures, eenvormige en internationaal aanvaardbare boekhoudregels en procedures aan, alsook de methode voor keuze door de contractant van onafhankelijke accountants die voor de Autoriteit aanvaardbaar zijn, teneinde de accountantscontrole te verrichten volgens deze regels, voorschriften en procedures.     
10.  De contractant stelt de accountants, overeenkomstig de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, de financiële gegevens ter beschikking die nodig zijn om vast te stellen of het bepaalde in dit artikel is nageleefd.   
11.  Alle kosten, uitgaven, opbrengsten en inkomsten, en alle prijzen en waarden, bedoeld in dit artikel, worden bepaald overeenkomstig algemeen erkende boekhoudbeginselen en de financiële regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.   
12.  Betalingen aan de Autoriteit ingevolge het vijfde en zesde lid, worden verricht in vrij te gebruiken valuta's, of valuta's die vrij voorhanden zijn en daadwerkelijk kunnen worden gebruikt op de voornaamste wisselmarkten dan wel naar keuze van de contractant, in het equivalent van be- en verwerkte metalen tegen de marktwaarde. De marktwaarde wordt bepaald overeenkomstig het vijfde lid, letter b. De vrij te gebruiken valuta's en valuta's die vrij voorhanden zijn en daadwerkelijk kunnen worden gebruikt op de voornaamste wisselmarkten worden omschreven in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit overeenkomstig de geldende internationale monetaire praktijk.   
13.  Alle financiële verplichtingen van de contractant jegens de Autoriteit, alsmede al zijn heffingen, kosten, uitgaven, opbrengsten en inkomsten, bedoeld in dit artikel, worden aangepast door deze uit te drukken in constante waarde ten opzichte van een referentiejaar.   
14.  De Autoriteit kan, met inachtneming van aanbevelingen van de Commissie voor Economische Planning en de Juridische en technische Commissie, regels, voorschriften en procedures aannemen, die voorzien in stimulansen -op eenvormige en non-discriminatoire basis- voor contractanten ter bevordering van de in het eerste lid vervatte doelstellingen.   
15.  In het geval van een geschil tussen de Autoriteit en een contractant over de uitlegging of toepassing van de financiële voorwaarden van een contract, kan elk der partijen het geschil voorleggen aan bindende commerciële arbitrage, tenzij beide partijen overeenkomen het geschil langs andere weg te regelen, zulks overeenkomstig artikel 188, tweede lid.   

### Artikel  14  

####Overdracht van gegevens

1.  De exploitant draagt, overeenkomstig de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit en de voorwaarden en bedingen van het werkplan, met door de Autoriteit bepaalde tussenpozen, alle gegevens aan haar over die zowel noodzakelijk als van belang zijn voor de doeltreffende uitoefening van de bevoegdheden en taken van de voornaamste organen van de Autoriteit met betrekking tot het door het werkplan bestreken gebied.   
2.  Overgedragen gegevens met betrekking tot het door het werkplan bestreken gebied, die geacht worden tot de industriële eigendom te behoren, mogen alleen worden gebruikt voor de in dit artikel uiteengezette doelen. Gegevens nodig voor de formulering door de Autoriteit van regels, voorschriften en procedures betreffende de bescherming van het mariene milieu en de veiligheid, behalve gegevens over het ontwerp van de uitrusting, worden niet geacht tot de industriële eigendom te behoren.   
3.  Gegevens overgedragen aan de Autoriteit door onderzoekers, aanvragers van contracten of contractanten, die geacht worden tot de industriële eigendom te behoren, worden door de Autoriteit niet medegedeeld aan de Onderneming of aan iemand buiten de Autoriteit, doch gegevens inzake de gereserveerde gebieden kunnen aan de Onderneming worden medegedeeld. Deze door zodanige personen aan de Onderneming overgedragen gegevens worden niet door de Onderneming medegedeeld aan de Autoriteit of aan iemand buiten de Autoriteit.   

### Artikel  15  

####Opleidingsprogramma 's

De contractant stelt praktische programma's op voor de opleiding van personeel van de Autoriteit en van ontwikkelingsstaten, met inbegrip van de deelneming van zulk personeel aan alle werkzaamheden in het Gebied dat door het contract wordt bestreken, zulks overeenkomstig artikel 144, tweede lid.  

### Artikel  16  

####Uitsluitend recht tot exploratie en exploitatie

Ingevolge Deel XI en haar regels, voorschriften en procedures verleent de Autoriteit de exploitant het uitsluitende recht tot exploratie en exploitatie van het door het werkplan bestreken gebied met betrekking tot een nader aangegeven categorie rijkdommen en verzekert zij dat geen ander lichaam in hetzelfde gebied werkzaam is ten aanzien van een andere categorie rijkdommen op een wijze die de exploitatie door de exploitant zou kunnen hinderen. De exploitant is verzekerd van bescherming van zijn contractuele rechten overeenkomstig artikel 153, zesde lid.  

### Artikel  17  

####Regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit

1.  De Autoriteit neemt overeenkomstig artikel 160, tweede lid, letter f, onder (ii), en artikel 162, tweede lid, letter o, onder (ii), regels, voorschriften en procedures aan en past deze eenvormig toe, ter uitoefening van haar taken zoals vervat in Deel XI inzake onder meer de onderstaande aangelegenheden: 

a. administratieve procedures betreffende prospectie, exploratie en exploitatie in het Gebied;  

b. werkzaamheden: 

(i) omvang van gebied;  

(ii) duur van de werkzaamheden;  

(iii) vereisten inzake prestatienormen, met inbegrip van de verzekeringen ingevolge artikel 4, zesde lid, letter c, van deze Bijlage;  

(iv) categorieën rijkdommen;  

(v) het afstand doen van gebieden;  

(vi) verslagen over voortgang der werkzaamheden;  

(vii) overlegging van gegevens;  

(viii) inspectie en controle van werkzaamheden;  

(ix) het voorkomen van hinder voor andere werkzaamheden in het mariene milieu;  

(x) overdracht van rechten en verplichtingen door een contractant;  

(xi) procedures voor de overdracht van technologie aan ontwikkelingsstaten overeenkomstig artikel 144 en voor rechtstreekse deelneming door deze Staten;  

(xii) normen en gebruiken voor de diepzeemijnbouw met inbegrip van die betreffende bedrijfsveiligheid, behoud van de rijkdommen en bescherming van het mariene milieu;  

(xiii) begripsomschrijving van commerciële produktie;  

(xiv) normen waaraan aanvragers dienen te voldoen;    

c. financiële aangelegenheden: 

(i) vaststelling van eenvormige en non-discriminatoire regels voor berekening van de kosten en voor de boekhouding en van de methode van keuze van de accountants;  

(ii) verdeling van de opbrengsten van de werkzaamheden;  

(iii) de stimulansen, bedoeld in artikel 13 van deze Bijlage;    

d. tenuitvoerlegging van ingevolge artikel 151, tiende lid, en artikel 164, tweede lid, letter d, genomen besluiten.     
2.  De regels, voorschriften en procedures inzake de volgende punten dienen ten volle aan de onderstaande objectieve maatstaven te voldoen: 

a. Omvang van de gebieden: De Autoriteit bepaalt de passende omvang van de gebieden voor exploratie, die tot tweemaal zo groot kunnen zijn als die voor exploitatie, ten einde intensieve exploratiewerkzaamheden mogelijk te maken. De omvang van het gebied wordt zo berekend, dat wordt voldaan aan de vereisten van artikel 8 van deze Bijlage inzake de reservering van gebieden, alsmede aan gestelde produktienormen verenigbaar met artikel 151 overeenkomstig de voorwaarden van het contract, met inachtneming van de stand van de technologie die dan beschikbaar is voor diepzeemijnbouw en de desbetreffende fysische kenmerken van de gebieden. De gebieden mogen niet kleiner of groter zijn dan nodig is om aan dit doel te beantwoorden.  

b. Duur van de werkzaamheden: 

(i) Voor prospectie wordt geen termijn gesteld;  

(ii) De exploratiefase dient lang genoeg te zijn om een grondig onderzoek van het desbetreffende gebied, het ontwerp en de constructie van de mijnbouwuitrusting voor het gebied en het ontwerp en de constructie van kleine en middelgrote installaties voor be- en verwerking met het oog op de beproeving van diepzeemijnbouw- en be- en verwerkingssystemen mogelijk te maken;  

(iii) De duur van de exploitatie dient samen te hangen met de economische levensduur van het mijnbouwproject, met inachtneming van factoren zoals de uitputting van het erts, de nuttige levensduur van diepzeemijnbouwuitrustingen installaties voor be- en verwerking en de commerciële levensvatbaarheid. De exploitatiefase dient lang genoeg te zijn om commerciële winning van delfstoffen uit het gebied mogelijk te maken en dient een redelijke termijn te omvatten voor de constructie van systemen voor diepzeemijnbouw en be- en verwerking op commerciële schaal, tijdens welke termijn commerciële produktie niet vereist is. De totale duur van de exploitatie dient echter ook kort genoeg te zijn om de Autoriteit een mogelijkheid te bieden de voorwaarden en bedingen van het werkplan te wijzigen op het tijdstip waarop zij verlenging overweegt overeenkomstig de regels, voorschriften en procedures die zij na goedkeuring van het werkplan heeft aanvaard.    

c. Prestatienormen: De Autoriteit dient te eisen dat tijdens de exploratiefase door de exploitant periodieke uitgaven worden verricht die in redelijke overeenstemming zijn met de omvang van het door het werkplan bestreken gebied en de uitgaven die verwacht kunnen worden van een bona fide exploitant die voornemens is het gebied in commerciële produktie te nemen binnen de door de Autoriteit vastgestelde termijnen. De vereiste uitgaven mogen niet worden vastgesteld op een niveau dat mogelijke exploitanten met minder kostbare technologie dan gewoonlijk in gebruik is zou afschrikken. De Autoriteit stelt een maximum tussenpoos vast, nadat de exploratiefase is voltooid en de exploitatiefase begint, om te komen tot commerciële produktie. Bij de bepaling van deze tussenpoos dient de Autoriteit te bedenken, dat de constructie van omvangrijke diepzeemijnbouw- en be- en verwerkingssystemen niet kan worden aangevangen dan na de beëindiging van de exploratiefase en de aanvang van de exploitatiefase. De tussenpoos voor het in commerciële produktie nemen van een gebied dient derhalve mede te zijn gebaseerd op de tijdsduur die voor deze constructie nodig is na de voltooiing van de exploratiefase; voorts dienen redelijke termijnen te worden aangehouden voor de onvermijdelijke vertragingen in het tijdschema van constructie. Wanneer de commerciële produktie is bereikt, verlangt de Autoriteit dat de exploitant, binnen redelijke grenzen en met inachtneming van alle desbetreffende factoren, gedurende het gehele tijdvak van het werkplan de commerciële produktie handhaaft.  

d. Categorieën rijkdommen: Bij de bepaling van de categorieën rijkdommen met betrekking waartoe een werkplan kan worden goedgekeurd, baseert de Autoriteit zich onder meer op de volgende feiten: 

(i) dat voor bepaalde rijkdommen het gebruik van soortgelijke mijnbouwmethoden vereist is; en  

(ii) dat sommige rijkdommen tegelijkertijd kunnen worden ontgonnen, zonder nodeloze onderlinge hinder voor exploitanten die verschillende rijkdommen in hetzelfde gebied ontginnen.   Niets in deze letter belet de Autoriteit een werkplan goed te keuren met betrekking tot meer dan een categorie rijkdommen in hetzelfde gebied voor dezelfde aanvrager.  

e. Het afstand doen van gebieden: De exploitant heeft het recht te allen tijde zonder sanctie afstand te doen van al zijn rechten of van een deel daarvan in het door een werkplan bestreken gebied.  

f. Bescherming van het mariene milieu: Er worden regels, voorschriften en procedures opgesteld ter verzekering van de doeltreffende bescherming van het mariene milieu tegen schadelijke gevolgen die rechtstreeks voortvloeien uit werkzaamheden in het Gebied of uit be- en verwerking aan boord van een schip direct boven een mijngebied, van uit dat mijngebied gewonnen delfstoffen, met inachtneming van de mate waarin zulke schadelijke gevolgen rechtstreeks kunnen voortvloeien uit het boren, het baggeren, het verrichten van kernboringen (voor het nemen van monsters) en het uitgraven en uit het vrijkomen, storten en lozen in het mariene milieu van sediment, afval of andere afvalvloeistoffen.  

g. Commerciële produktie: De commerciële produktie wordt geacht te zijn aangevangen indien een exploitant zich bezig houdt met voortdurende grootscheepse winningswerkzaamheden die een hoeveelheid materiaal opleveren die voldoende is om duidelijk aan te geven dat het hoofddoel veeleer grootscheepse produktie is dan produktie, bedoeld voor de vergaring van informatie, analyse of de beproeving van uitrusting of installaties.     

### Artikel  18  

####Sancties

1.  De rechten van een contractant krachtens een contract kunnen alleen in de volgende gevallen worden opgeschort of beëindigd: 

a. indien de contractant, ondanks waarschuwingen van de Autoriteit, zijn werkzaamheden op zodanige wijze heeft verricht dat zulks heeft geleid tot ernstige, voortdurende en opzettelijke schendingen van de fundamentele voorwaarden van het contract, van Deel XI en van de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit; of  

b. indien de contractant nagelaten heeft een voor hem geldende definitieve bindende beslissing van het lichaam ter regeling van geschillen, na te leven.     
2.  In het geval van een schending van het contract die niet valt onder het eerste lid, letter a, of in plaats van opschorting of beëindiging krachtens het eerste lid, letter a, kan de Autoriteit aan de contractant geldstraffen opleggen naar evenredigheid van de ernst van de schending.   
3.  Behalve voor bevelen in een noodsituatie krachtens artikel 162, tweede lid, letter w, mag de Autoriteit een besluit tot oplegging van geldstraffen, of tot opschorting of beëindiging, niet uitvoeren totdat de contractant een redelijke mogelijkheid is geboden van de hem ingevolge Deel XI, afdeling 5, ten dienste staande rechtsmiddelen volledig gebruik te maken.   

### Artikel  19  

####Herziening van een contract

1.  Wanneer er zich omstandigheden hebben voorgedaan of zich vermoedelijk zullen voordoen waarin, naar de mening van een der partijen, het contract onbillijk zou worden, of het onuitvoerbaar of onmogelijk zou worden de in het contract of in Deel XI uiteengezette doelstellingen te verwezenlijken, treden de partijen in onderhandeling, om het contract dienovereenkomstig te wijzigen.   
2.  Overeenkomstig artikel 153, derde lid, gesloten contracten kunnen slechts worden gewijzigd met de instemming van de partijen.   

### Artikel  20  

####Overdracht van rechten en verplichtingen

De op grond van een contract ontstane rechten en verplichtingen kunnen alleen met toestemming van de Autoriteit en overeenkomstig haar regels, voorschriften en procedures worden overgedragen. De Autoriteit onthoudt niet op onredelijke wijze haar toestemming aan de overdracht, indien de voorgestelde concessionair in alle opzichten een aanvrager is die aan de voorwaarden voldoet en hij alle verplichtingen op zich neemt van degene die de overdracht verricht en indien bij de overdracht niet aan de concessionair een werkplan wordt verstrekt, waarvan de goedkeuring verboden is krachtens artikel 6, derde lid, letter c, van deze Bijlage.  

### Artikel  21  

####Toepasselijke wet

1.  Op het contract zijn van toepassing de voorwaarden van het contract, de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, Deel XI en andere regelen van het internationaal recht die niet strijdig zijn met dit Verdrag.   
2.  Elk definitief vonnis, uitgesproken door een rechtbank of hof, dat krachtens dit Verdrag rechtsmacht heeft, met betrekking tot de rechten en verplichtingen van de Autoriteit en van de contractant is uitvoerbaar op het grondgebied van elke Staat die Partij is.   
3.  Geen enkele Staat die Partij is, mag aan een contractant voorwaarden opleggen die onverenigbaar zijn met Deel XI. De toepassing evenwel door een Staat die Partij is, op contractanten waarvoor hij borg staat, of op schepen die zijn vlag voeren, van milieuvoorschriften of andere wetten en voorschriften die strenger zijn dan die vervat in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, aangenomen ingevolge artikel 17, tweede lid, letter f, van deze Bijlage, wordt niet onverenigbaar met Deel XI geacht.   

### Artikel  22  

####Verantwoordelijkheid

De contractant is verantwoordelijk of aansprakelijk voor enige schade voortvloeiend uit onjuist handelen bij het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met het aandeel van de Autoriteit daarin, op grond van haar handelingen of nalatigheden. Evenzo is de Autoriteit verantwoordelijk of aansprakelijk voor enige schade, voortvloeiend uit onjuist optreden in de uitoefening van haar bevoegdheden en functies, met inbegrip van schendingen ingevolge artikel 168, tweede lid, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met het aandeel van de contractant daarin, op grond van diens handelingen of nalatigheden. In alle gevallen dient de schadevergoeding overeen te komen met de werkelijk geleden schade.

De Directeur-Generaal bekleedt zijn functie voor een vastgestelde termijn, die niet langer is dan vijf jaar, en kan worden herkozen voor volgende ambtstermijnen.   
2.  De Directeur-Generaal is de wettelijke vertegenwoordiger en hoogste functionaris van de Onderneming en is rechtstreeks verantwoordelijk jegens de Raad van Bestuur voor de leiding van de werkzaamheden van de Onderneming.

3.  De allerbelangrijkste overweging bij de aanwerving en indienstneming van het personeel en bij de vaststelling van hun arbeidsvoorwaarden is de noodzaak, de hoogste normen van efficiëntie en van technische bekwaamheid te waarborgen. Onder dit voorbehoud wordt naar behoren aandacht besteed aan het belang van de aanwerving van het personeel op een billijke geografische grondslag.   
4.  Bij de uitoefening van hun taken ontvangen noch verzoeken de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel instructies van enige regering of van enige andere bron buiten de Onderneming. Zij onthouden zich van handelingen die afbreuk zouden kunnen doen aan hun positie als internationale ambtenaren van de Onderneming die alleen jegens de Onderneming verantwoordelijk zijn. Elke Staat die Partij is, verbindt zich ertoe, het uitsluitend internationale karakter van het dienstverband van de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel te eerbiedigen en niet te pogen hen te beïnvloeden bij het nakomen van hun verantwoordelijkheden.   
5.  De verplichtingen, vervat in artikel 168, tweede lid, gelden eveneens voor het personeel van de Onderneming.

3.  Gedurende een aanvangsperiode die de Onderneming nodig heeft om financieel zelfstandig te worden, en die niet langer mag zijn dan 10 jaar vanaf de aanvang van de commerciële produktie door de Onderneming, stelt de Vergadering de Onderneming vrij van de betalingen, bedoeld in het eerste lid, en laat zij het gehele netto inkomen van de Onderneming in haar reserves.

####Financiën

1.  De financiële middelen van de Onderneming omvatten: 

a. de overeenkomstig artikel 173, tweede lid, letter b, van de Autoriteit ontvangen bedragen;  

b. door Staten die Partij zijn verstrekte vrijwillige bijdragen ter financiering van werkzaamheden van de Onderneming;  

c. door de Onderneming overeenkomstig het tweede en derde lid geleende bedragen;  

d. inkomen van de Onderneming uit haar werkzaamheden;  

e. andere aan de Onderneming ter beschikking gestelde middelen ten einde deze in staat te stellen zo spoedig mogelijk haar werkzaamheden aan te vangen en haar taken te vervullen.     
2.  

a. De Onderneming is bevoegd middelen te lenen en het door haar te bepalen onderpand of andere zekerheid te verstrekken. Alvorens haar obligaties in het openbaar te verkopen op de financiële markt of in de valuta van een Staat die Partij is, dient de Onderneming de goedkeuring van die Staat te verkrijgen. Het totale bedrag van de leningen wordt door de Raad goedgekeurd op aanbeveling van de Raad van Bestuur.  

b. Staten die Partij zijn stellen alles in het werk, in de mate van het redelijke, om aanvragen door de Onderneming voor leningen op kapitaalmarkten en van internationale financiële instellingen te steunen.     
3.  

a. De Onderneming worden de financiële middelen verstrekt die nodig zijn voor de exploratie en exploitatie van één mijngebied en voor het vervoer, de be- en verwerking en de afzet van de daaruit gewonnen delfstoffen, en het daaruit verkregen nikkel, koper, kobalt en mangaan, en om haar aanvankelijke administratieve kosten te dekken. Het bedrag van genoemde financiële middelen, en de criteria en factoren voor de aanpassing van dit bedrag, worden door de Voorbereidende Commissie aangegeven in de ontwerpen van de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.  

b. Alle Staten die Partij zijn stellen de Onderneming een bedrag ter beschikking gelijk aan de helft van de in letter a bedoelde financiële middelen, in de vorm van langlopende renteloze leningen, overeenkomstig de contributieschaal voor de gewone begroting van de Verenigde Naties, die van kracht is op het tijdstip waarop de contributies moeten worden betaald, aangepast ten einde rekening te houden met de Staten die geen lid van de Verenigde Naties zijn. Door de Onderneming aangegane schulden bij het bijeenbrengen van de andere helft van de financiële middelen worden door alle Staten die Partij zijn gegarandeerd overeenkomstig dezelfde schaal.  

c. Indien het totaal van de financiële bijdragen van de Staten die Partij zijn, minder is dan de ingevolge letter a aan de Onderneming te verschaffen financiële middelen, beziet de Vergadering tijdens haar eerste zitting de omvang van het tekort en neemt zij bij consensus maatregelen aan om in dit tekort te voorzien, met inachtneming van de verplichting van Staten die Partij zijn ingevolge de letters a en b en de aanbevelingen van de Voorbereidende Commissie.  

d. 

(i) Elke Staat die Partij is deponeert, binnen 60 dagen na de inwerngtreding van dit Verdrag of binnen 30 dagen na de nederlegging van jn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding, naar gelang welke van beide het laatst valt, bij de Onderneming niet-verhandelbare renteloze promessen tot het bedrag van het aandeel van die Staat in de renteloze leningen ngevolge letter b.  

(ii) De Raad van Bestuur stelt, op de vroegst mogelijke datum nadat dit Verdrag in werking treedt, en daarna jaarlijks of met andere passende tussenpozen, een overzicht op van de omvang van en de tijdstippen waarop hij gelden nodig heeft voor zijn administratieve kosten en voor werkzaamheden door de Onderneming verricht overeenkomstig artikel 170 en artikel 12 van deze Bijlage.  

(iii) De Staten die Partij zijn worden daarop via de Autoriteit door de Onderneming in kennis gesteld van hun onderscheiden aandeel in de financiële middelen als vastgesteld overeenkomstig het derde lid, letter b, die nodig zijn voor zulke kosten. De Onderneming int de bedragen van promessen die nodig zijn om de uitgaven, bedoeld in het overzicht te dekken met inachtneming van de renteloze leningen.  

(iv) De Staten die Partij zijn stellen, bij ontvangst van de kennisgeving, hun onderscheiden aandeel in de schuldgaranties aan de Onderneming ter beschikking overeenkomstig letter b.    

e. 

(i) Indien de Onderneming zulks verzoekt, kunnen Staten die Partij zijn schuldgaranties verschaffen naast die verschaft overeenkomstig de butieschaal bedoeld in letter b.  

(ii) Een Staat die Partij is, kan in plaats van schuldgaranties een vrijwillige bijdrage verstrekken aan de Onderneming tot een bedrag gelijk aan dat aandeel in de schulden dat hij anders zou moeten garanderen.    

f. Terugbetaling van rentedragende leningen heeft voorrang boven terugbetaling van renteloze leningen. Terugbetaling van renteloze leningen geschiedt overeenkomstig een tijdschema, aangenomen door de Vergadering, op aanbeveling van de Raad en op advies van de Raad van Bestuur. Bij de uitoefening van deze functie wordt de Raad van Bestuur geleid door de desbetreffende bepalingen in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit, waarin rekening wordt gehouden met het allesoverheersende belang de doeltreffende werking van de Onderneming te verzekeren en inzonderheid, haar financiële onafhankelijkheid te waarborgen.  

g. Aan de Onderneming ter beschikking gestelde financiële middelen bestaan uit vrij te gebruiken valuta's of valuta's die vrij beschikbaar zijn en daadwerkelijk bruikbaar op de belangrijkste wisselmarkten. Deze valuta's worden omschreven in de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit overeenkomstig de geldende internationale monetaire praktijk. Behalve zoals bepaald in het tweede lid, handhaaft een Staat die Partij is geen beperkingen, of legt deze op, aan het bezit, het gebruik of de inwisseling door de Onderneming van deze financiële middelen.  

h. „Schuldgarantie” betekent een belofte van een Staat die Partij is aan de crediteuren van de Onderneming tot betaling, pro rata overeenkomstig de desbetreffende verdeelsleutel, van de financiële verplichtingen van de Onderneming die worden gedekt door de garantie, na kennisgeving door de crediteuren aan de Staat die Partij is van een niet nakoming van haar verplichtingen door de Onderneming. De procedures voor de betaling van deze verplichtingen dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met de regels, voorschriften en procedures van de Autoriteit.     
4.  De financiële middelen, activa en uitgaven van de Onderneming worden gescheiden gehouden van die van de Autoriteit. Dit artikel belet de Onderneming niet, regelingen met de Autoriteit te treffen aangaande voorzieningen, personeel en diensten en regelingen voor vergoeding van administratieve kosten, door een van de twee partijen ten behoeve van de andere betaald.   
5.  De archieven, boeken en rekeningen van de Onderneming, met inbegrip van haar financiële jaaroverzichten, worden jaarlijks gecontroleerd door een onafhankelijke accountant, benoemd door de Raad.

b. Indien er meer dan één bod is, dat zulk een combinatie biedt, wordt het contract gesloten overeenkomstig:

(ii) door de Raad goedgekeurde richtlijnen met betrekking tot de voorkeur die moet worden toegekend aan goederen en diensten afkomstig uit ontwikkelingsstaten met name die zonder zeekust en met een ongunstige geografische ligging.    

c. De Raad van Bestuur kan regels aannemen ter vaststelling van de bijzondere omstandigheden waarin in het belang van de Onderneming kan worden afgezien van de vereiste van het doen uitgaan van verzoeken om het doen van een bod.     
4.  De Onderneming heeft het eigendomsrecht op alle door haar geproduceerde delfstoffen en bewerkte stoffen.   
5.  De Onderneming verkoopt haar produkten op non-discriminatoire grondslag. Zij geeft geen niet-commerciële kortingen.

De Onderneming mengt zich niet in de politieke aangelegenheden van Staten die Partij zijn, en evenmin wordt zij bij haar besluiten beïnvloed door het staatkundig karakter van de betrokken Staat die Partij is.

### Artikel  2  

####Lijst van scheidsmannen

1.  Er wordt een lijst van scheidsmannen opgesteld en bijgehouden door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties. Elke Staat die Partij is, is bevoegd vier scheidsmannen aan te wijzen, die ieder ervaring in scheepvaartzaken dienen te hebben en, wat onpartijdigheid, deskundigheid en integriteit betreft, in hoog aanzien dienen te staan. De namen van de aldus aangewezen personen vormen de lijst.   
2.  Indien het aantal scheidsmannen door een Staat die Partij is, aangewezen en op de lijst voorkomend op enig tijdstip kleiner is dan vier, is die Staat bevoegd om de noodzakelijke aanvullende aanwijzingen te verrichten.   
3.  De naam van een scheidsman blijft op de lijst totdat deze is afgevoerd door de Staat die Partij is die de aanwijzing verrichtte, met dien verstande dat deze scheidsman zitting blijft hebben in elk scheidsgerecht waarin hij is benoemd tot de beëindiging van de procedure voor dat scheidsgerecht.   

### Artikel  3  

####Samenstelling van het scheidsgerecht

Met het oog op de in deze Bijlage voorziene procedure wordt het scheidsgerecht als volgt samengesteld, tenzij de partijen anderszins overeenkomen: 

a. Onder voorbehoud van letter g, bestaat het scheidsgerecht uit vijf leden.  

b. De partij die de procedure begint benoemt een lid, dat bij voorkeur wordt gekozen van de in artikel 2 van deze Bijlage bedoelde lijst en dat de nationaliteit van die partij kan bezitten. De benoeming wordt in de in artikel 1 van deze Bijlage genoemde kennisgeving opgenomen.  

c. De andere partij bij het geschil benoemt binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van de in artikel 1 van deze Bijlage bedoelde kennisgeving een lid, dat bij voorkeur wordt gekozen van de lijst en dat de nationaliteit van die partij kan bezitten. Indien de benoeming niet binnen die termijn geschiedt, kan de partij die de procedure begint binnen twee weken na afloop van die termijn verzoeken de benoeming overeenkomstig letter e te verrichten.  

d. De drie andere leden worden benoemd in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de partijen. Zij worden bij voorkeur van de lijst gekozen en bezitten de nationaliteit van derde Staten, tenzij de partijen anderszins overeenkomen. De partijen bij het geschil benoemen de Voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht uit deze drie leden. Indien de partijen binnen 60 dagen na ontvangst van de in artikel 1 van deze Bijlage bedoelde kennisgeving geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de benoeming van een of meer van de leden van het scheidsgerecht die in overeenstemming moeten worden benoemd of over de benoeming van de Voorzitter, wordt/worden de overblijvende benoeming of benoemingen verricht overeenkomstig letter e op verzoek van een partij bij het geschil. Dit verzoek wordt gedaan binnen twee weken na afloop van de hiervoor genoemde termijn van 60 dagen.  

e. Tenzij de partijen overeenkomen dat de benoemingen krachtens de letters c en d worden verricht door een persoon of een derde staat, gekozen door de partijen, verricht de Voorzitter van het Internationale Hof voor het Recht van de Zee de noodzakelijke benoemingen. Indien de Voorzitter verhinderd is dit te doen of de nationaliteit bezit van een van de partijen bij het geschil, wordt de benoeming verricht door het in dienstjaren oudste lid van het Internationale Hof voor het Recht van de Zee dat aanwezig is en niet de nationaliteit bezit van een van de partijen. De in deze letter bedoelde benoemingen worden verricht door een keuze van de in artikel 2 van deze Bijlage genoemde lijst binnen een termijn van 30 dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek en in overleg met de partijen. De aldus benoemde leden mogen niet dezelfde nationaliteit bezitten, noch in dienst zijn van een van de partijen bij het geschil, hun gewone verblijfplaats hebben op het grondgebied daarvan of de nationaliteit daarvan bezitten.  

f. Elke vacature wordt vervuld op de voor de oorspronkelijke benoeming voorgeschreven wijze.  

g. De partijen die hetzelfde belang hebben benoemen gezamenlijk en in onderlinge overeenstemming een lid van het scheidsgerecht. Wanneer diverse partijen verschillende belangen hebben of het er niet over eens kunnen worden of zij gelijke belangen hebben, benoemt ieder van hen een lid van het scheidsgerecht. Het aantal van de door de partijen ieder voor zich benoemde leden van het scheidsgerecht dient altijd één minder te zijn dan het aantal van de door de partijen gezamenlijk te benoemen leden van het scheidsgerecht.  

h. Het bepaalde in de letters a tot en met f wordt zo ver als mogelijk toegepast op de geschillen waarbij meer dan twee partijen zijn betrokken.    

### Artikel  4  

####Functies van het scheidsgerecht

Een ingevolge artikel 3 van deze Bijlage ingesteld scheidsgerecht oefent zijn functies uit overeenkomstig deze Bijlage en de andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  5  

####Procedure

Tenzij de partijen bij het geschil anderszins overeenkomen, stelt het scheidsgerecht zijn eigen procedure vast, waarbij aan iedere partij de mogelijkheid wordt gegeven om te worden gehoord en haar zaak toe te lichten.  

### Artikel  6  

####Verplichtingen van de partijen bij het geschil

De partijen bij het geschil vergemakkelijken de taak van het scheidsgerecht en dienen in het bijzonder, overeenkomstig hun wetten en met gebruikmaking van alle tot hun beschikking staande middelen: 

a. het scheidsgerecht te voorzien van alle documenten, faciliteiten en inlichtingen in verband met de zaak; en  

b. wanneer dat noodzakelijk is, het scheidsgerecht in staat te stellen getuigen of deskundigen op te roepen en te aanhoren en de plaatsen te bezoeken die een verband hebben met de zaak.    

### Artikel  7  

####Kosten

Tenzij het scheidsgerecht anders besluit vanwege de bijzondere omstandigheden van de zaak, worden de kosten van het scheidsgerecht, met inbegrip van de bezoldiging van de leden, gedragen door de partijen bij het geschil in gelijke delen.  

### Artikel  8  

####Vereiste meerderheid voor beslissingen

De beslissingen van het scheidsgerecht worden genomen bij meerderheid van de leden. De afwezigheid of onthouding van minder dan de helft van de leden vormt geen beletsel voor het scheidsgerecht om een beslissing te nemen. Wanneer de stemmen staken, geeft de stem van de Voorzitter de doorslag.  

### Artikel  9  

####Niet-verschijning

Wanneer een van de partijen bij het geschil niet verschijnt voor het scheidsgerecht of haar middelen niet doet gelden, kan de andere partij het scheidsgerecht verzoeken de zaak voort te zetten en een uitspraak te doen. De afwezigheid van een partij of het feit dat een partij haar middelen niet doet gelden vormt geen beletsel voor de voortgang van de procedure. Alvorens een uitspraak te doen moet het scheidsgerecht zich ervan verzekeren niet alleen dat het bevoegd is in het geschil, maar ook dat de vordering feitelijk en rechtens gegrond is.  

### Artikel  10

Tenzij de partijen overeenkomen dat de benoeming wordt verricht door een persoon of een derde Staat, gekozen door de partijen, verricht de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van een verzoek ingevolge de letters c en d de noodzakelijke benoemingen. De in deze letter bedoelde benoemingen worden verricht uit de in aanmerking komende lijst of lijsten van deskundigen, bedoeld in artikel 2 van deze Bijlage en in overleg met de partijen bij het geschil en de desbetreffende internationale organisatie.

f. Elke vacature wordt vervuld op de voor de oorspronkelijke benoeming voorgeschreven wijze.  

g. De partijen die hetzelfde belang hebben benoemen gezamenlijk en in onderlinge overeenstemming twee leden van het scheidsgerecht.
