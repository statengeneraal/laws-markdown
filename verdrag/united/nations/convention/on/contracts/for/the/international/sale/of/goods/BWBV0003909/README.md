####United Nations Convention on contracts for the International sale of goods

The States Parties to this Convention, Bearing in mind the broad objectives in the resolutions adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the establishment of a New International Economic Order, Considering that the development of international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is an important element in promoting friendly relations among States, Being of the opinion that the adoption of uniform rules which govern contracts for the international sale of goods and take into account the different social, economic and legal systems would contribute to the removal of legal barriers in international trade and promote the development of international trade,   Have agreed as follows:     
### PART  I

### Chapter  I  

####SPHERE OF APPLICATION

### Article  1  

(1).  This Convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States: 

(a) when the States are Contracting States; or  

(b) when the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a Contracting State.     
(2).  The fact that the parties have their places of business in different States is to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the contract or from any dealings between, or from information disclosed by, the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract.   
(3).  Neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the application of this Convention.   

### Article  2

(2).  This Convention does not apply to contracts in which the preponderant part of the obligations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour or other services.   

### Article  4  

This Convention governs only the formation of the contracts of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from such a contract. In particular, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention, it is not concerned with:

### Chapter  II  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  7  

(1).  In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international trade.   
(2).  Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.   

### Article  8  

(1).  For the purposes of this Convention statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to his intent where the other party knew or could not have been unaware what that intent was.   
(2).  If the preceding paragraph is not applicable, statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to the understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances.   
(3).  In determining the intent of a party or the understanding a reasonable person would have had, due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.   

### Article  9  

(1).  The parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves.   
(2).  The parties are considered, unless otherwise agreed, to have impliedly made applicable to their contract or its formation a usage of which the parties knew or ought to have known and which in international trade is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade concerned.   

### Article  10  

For the purposes of this Convention: 

(a) if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract;  

(b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual residence.    

### Article  11  

A contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form. It may be proved by any means, including witnesses.  

### Article  12  

Any provision of article 11, article 29 or Part II of this Convention that allows a contract of sale or its modification or termination by agreement or any offer, acceptance or other indication to be made in any form other than in writing does not apply where any party has his place of business in a Contracting State which has made a declaration under article 96 of this Convention. The parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of this article.  

### Article  13  

For the purposes of this Convention “writing” includes telegram and telex.  

### PART  II  

####FORMATION OF THE CONTRACT

### Article  14  

(1).  A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provisions for determining the quantity and the price.   
(2).  A proposal other than one addressed to one more specific persons is to be considered merely as an invitation to make offers, unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the person making the proposal.   

### Article  15  

(1).  An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.   
(2).  An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer.   

### Article  16  

(1).  Until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before he has dispatched an acceptance.   
(2).  However, an offer cannot be revoked: 

(a) if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that it is irrevocable; or  

(b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer.     

### Article  17  

An offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror.  

### Article  18  

(1).  A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.   
(2).  An acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror. An acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent does not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction, including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.   
(3).  However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act, such as one relating to the dispatch of the goods or payment of the price, without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective at the moment the act is performed, provided that the act is performed within the period of time laid down in the preceding paragraph.   

### Article  19  

(1).  A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.   
(2).  However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.   
(3).  Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one party's liability to the other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially.   

### Article  20  

(1).  A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror in a telegram or a letter begins to run from the moment the telegram is handed in for dispatch or from the date shown on the letter or, if no such date is shown, from the date shown on the envelope. A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror by telephone, telex or other means of instantaneous communication, begins to run from the moment that the offer reaches the offeree.   
(2).  Official holidays or non-business days occurring during the period for acceptance are included in calculating the period. However, if a notice of acceptance cannot be delivered at the address of the offeror on the last day of the period because that day falls on an official holiday or a non-business day at the place of business of the offeror, the period is extended until the first business day which follows.   

### Article  21  

(1).  A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without delay the offeror orally so informs the offeree or dispatches a notice to that effect.   
(2).  If a letter or other writing containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless, without delay, the offeror orally informs the offeree that he considers his offer as having lapsed or dispatches a notice to that effect.   

### Article  22  

An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective.  

### Article  23  

A contract is concluded at the moment when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.  

### Article  24  

For the purposes of this Part of the Convention, an offer, declaration of acceptance or any other indication of intention “reaches” the addressee when it is made orally to him or delivered by any other means to him personally, to his place of business or mailing address or, if he does not have a place of business or mailing address, to his habitual residence.  

### PART  III  

####SALE OF GOODS

### Chapter  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  25  

A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee and a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen such a result.  

### Article  26  

A declaration of avoidance of the contract is effective only if made by notice to the other party.  

### Article  27  

Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Part of the Convention, if any notice, request or other communication is given or made by a party in accordance with this Part and by means appropriate in the circumstances, a delay or error in the transmission of the communication or its failure to arrive does not deprive that party of the right to rely on the communication.  

### Article  28  

If, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, one party is entitled to require performance of any obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a judgement for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by this Convention.  

### Article  29  

(1).  A contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties.   
(2).  A contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or terminated by agreement. However, a party may be precluded by his conduct from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct.   

### Chapter  II  

####OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER

### Article  30

(b) if, in cases not within the preceding subparagraph, the contract relates to specific goods, or unidentified goods to be drawn from a specific stock or to be manufactured or produced, and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the parties knew that the goods were at, or were to be manufactured or produced at, a particular place - in placing the goods at the buyer's disposal at that place;  

(c) in other cases - in placing the goods at the buyer's disposal at the place where the seller had his place of business at the time of the conclusion of the contract.    

### Article  32  

(1).  If the seller, in accordance with the contract or this Convention, hands the goods over to a carrier and if the goods are not clearly identified to the contract by markings on the goods, by shipping documents or otherwise, the seller must give the buyer notice of the consignment specifying the goods.   
(2).  If the seller is bound to arrange for carriage of the goods, he must make such contracts as are necessary for carriage to the place fixed by means of transportation appropriate in the circumstances and according to the usual terms for such transportation.

(a) if a date is fixed by or determinable from the contract, on that date;

### Article  34  

If the seller is bound to hand over documents relating to the goods, he must hand them over at the time and place and in the form required by the contract. If the seller has handed over documents before that time, he may, up to that time, cure any lack of conformity in the documents, if the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense.

(a) re fit for the purposes for which goods of the same description would ordinarily be used;  

(b) are fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract, except where the circumstances show that the buyer did not rely, or that it was unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller's skill and judgement;

(3).  The seller is not liable under subparagraphs (a) to (d) of the preceding paragraph for any lack of conformity of the goods if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of conformity.   

### Article  36  

(1).  The seller is liable in accordance with the contract and this Convention for any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the risk passes to the buyer, even though the lack of conformity becomes apparent only after that time.   
(2).

### Article  37  

If the seller has delivered goods before the date for delivery, he may, up to that date, deliver any missing part or make up any deficiency in the quantity of the goods delivered, or deliver goods in replacement of any non-conforming goods delivered or remedy any lack of conformity in the goods delivered, provided that the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense.

If the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity for examination by him and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or ought to have known of the possibility of such redirection or redispatch, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new destination.   

### Article  39  

(1).  The buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of conformity within a reasonable time after he has discovered it or ought to have discovered it.   
(2).  In any event, the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give the seller notice thereof at the latest within a period of two years from the date on which the goods were actually handed over to the buyer, unless this time-limit is inconsistent with a contractual period of guarantee.   

### Article  40  

The seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of articles 38 and 39 if the lack of conformity relates to facts of which he knew or could not have been unaware and which he did not disclose to the buyer.  

### Article  41

### Article  42  

(1).  The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party based on industrial property or other intellectual property, of which at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or could not have been unaware, provided that the right or claim is based on industrial property or other intellectual property:

(2).  The seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of the preceding paragraph if he knew of the right or claim of the third party and the nature of it.   

### Article  44  

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of article 39 and paragraph (1) of article 43, the buyer may reduce the price in accordance with article 50 or claim damages, except for loss of profit, if he has a reasonable excuse for his failure to give the required notice.

(2).  Unless the buyer has received notice from the seller that he will not perform within the period so fixed, the buyer may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for breach of contract. However, the buyer is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to claim damages for delay in performance.   

### Article  48  

(1).  Subject to article 49, the seller may, even after the date for delivery, remedy at his own expense any failure to perform his obligations, if he can do so without unreasonable delay and without causing the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or uncertainty of reimbursement by the seller of expenses advanced by the buyer. However, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this Convention.   
(2).  If the seller requests the buyer to make known whether he will accept performance and the buyer does not comply with the request within a reasonable time, the seller may perform within the time indicated in his request. The buyer may not, during that period of time, resort to any remedy which is inconsistent with performance by the seller.   
(3).  A notice by the seller that he will perform within a specified period of time is assumed to include a request, under the preceding paragraph, that the buyer make known his decision.

However, if the seller remedies any failure to perform his obligations in accordance with article 37 or article 48 or if the buyer refuses to accept performance by the seller in accordance with those articles, the buyer may not reduce the price.  

### Article  51  

(1).  If the seller delivers only a part of the goods or if only a part of the goods delivered is in conformity with the contract, articles 46 to 50 apply in respect of the part which is missing or which does not conform.

If under the contract the buyer is to specify the form, measurement or other features of the goods and he fails to make such specification either on the date agreed upon or within a reasonable time after receipt of a request from the seller, the seller may, without prejudice to any other rights he may have, make the specification himself in accordance with the requirements of the buyer that may be known to him.   
(2).  If the seller makes the specification himself, he must inform the buyer of the details thereof and must fix a reasonable time within which the buyer may make a different specification. If, after receipt of such a communication, the buyer fails to do so within the time so fixed, the specification made by the seller is binding.   

### Chapter  IV  

####PASSING OF RISK

### Article  66  

Loss of or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer does not discharge him from his obligation to pay the price, unless the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of the seller.  

### Article  67  

(1).  If the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not bound to hand them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of sale. If the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place. The fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods does not affect the passage of the risk.   
(2).  Nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise.   

### Article  68  

The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying the contract of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller.  

### Article  69  

(1).  In cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he takes over the goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are placed at his disposal and he commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery.   
(2).  However, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a place of business of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware of the fact that the goods are placed at his disposal at that place.   
(3).  If the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are considered not to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract.   

### Article  70  

If the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract, articles 67, 68 and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on account of the breach.  

### Chapter  V  

####PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER AND OF THE BUYER

### Section  I  

####Anticipatory breach and instalment contracts

### Article  71  

(1).  A party may suspend the performance of his obligations if, after the conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations as a result of: 

(a) a serious deficiency in his ability to perform of in his creditworthiness; or  

(b) his conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract.     
(2).  If the seller has already dispatched the goods before the grounds described in the preceding paragraph become evident, he may prevent the handing over of the goods to the buyer even though the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain them. The present paragraph relates only to the rights in the goods as between the buyer and the seller.   
(3).  A party suspending performance, whether before or after dispatch of the goods, must immediately give notice of the suspension to the other party and must continue with performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of his performance.   

### Article  72  

(1).  If prior to the date for performance of the contract it is clear that one of the parties will commit a fundamental breach of contract, the other party may declare the contract avoided.   
(2).  If time allows, the party intending to declare the contract avoided must give reasonable notice to the other party in order to permit him to provide adequate assurance of his performance.   
(3).  The requirements of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the other party has declared that he will not perform his obligations.   

### Article  73  

(1).  In the case of a contract for delivery of goods by instalments, if the failure of one party to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes a fundamental breach of contract with respect to that instalment, the other party may declare the contract avoided with respect to that instalment.   
(2).  If one party's failure to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach of contract will occur with respect to future instalments, he may declare the contract avoided for the future, provided that he does so within a reasonable time.   
(3).  A buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any delivery may, at the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries already made or of future deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for the purpose contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract.   

### Section  II  

####Damages

### Article  74  

Damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach. Such damages may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of which he then knew or ought to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of contract.  

### Article  75  

If the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replacement or the seller has resold the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract price and the price in the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74.  

### Article  76  

(1).  If the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the party claiming damages may, if he has not made a purchase of resale under article 75, recover the difference between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the time of avoidance as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. If, however, the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance.   
(2).  For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.   

### Article  77  

A party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting from the breach. If he fails to take such measures, the party in breach may claim a reduction in the damages in the amount by which the loss should have been mitigated.  

### Section  III  

####Interest

### Article  78  

If a party fails to pay the price or any other sum that is in arrears, the other party is entitled to interest on it, without prejudice to any claim for damages recoverable under article 74.  

### Section  IV  

####Exemptions

### Article  79  

(1).  A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.   
(2).  If the party's failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt from liability only if: 

(a) he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and  

(b) the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.     
(3).  The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which the impediment exists.   
(4).  The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt.   
(5).  Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other than to claim damages under this Convention.   

### Article  80  

A party may not rely on a failure of the other party to perform, to the extent that such failure was caused by the first party's act or omission.  

### Section  V  

####Effects of avoidance

### Article  81  

(1).  Avoidance of the contract releases both parties from their obligations under it, subject to any damages which may be due. Avoidance does not affect any provision of the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other provision of the contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties consequent upon the avoidance of the contract.   
(2).  A party who has performed the contract either wholly or in part may claim restitution from the other party of whatever the first party has supplied or paid under the contract. If both parties are bound to make restitution, they must do so concurrently.   

### Article  82  

(1).  The buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them.   
(2).  The preceding paragraph does not apply: 

(a) if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which the buyer received them is not due to his act or omission;  

(b) if the goods or part of the goods have perished or deteriorated as a result of the examination provided for in article 38; or  

(c) if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity.     

### Article  83  

A buyer who has lost the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods in accordance with article 82 retains all other remedies under the contract and his Convention.  

### Article  84  

(1).  If the seller is bound to refund the price, he must also pay interest on it, from the date on which the price was paid.   
(2).  The buyer must account to the seller for all benefits which he has derived from the goods or part of them: 

(a) if he must make restitution of the goods or part of them; or  

(b) if it is impossible for him to make restitution of all or part of the goods or to make restitution of all or part of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them, but he has nevertheless declared the contract avoided or required the seller to deliver substitute goods.     

### Section  VI  

####Preservation of the goods

### Article  85  

If the buyer is in delay in taking delivery of the goods or, where payment of the price and delivery of the goods are to be made concurrently, if he fails to pay the price, and the seller is either in possession of the goods or otherwise able to control their disposition, the seller must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to preserve them. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the buyer.  

### Article  86  

(1).  If the buyer has received the goods and intends to exercise any right under the contract or this Convention to reject them, he must take such steps to preserve them as are reasonable in the circumstances. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the seller.   
(2).  If goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at his disposal at their destination and he exercises the right to reject them, he must take possession of them on behalf of the seller, provided that this can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. This provision does not apply if the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on his behalf is present at the destination. If the buyer takes possession of the goods under this paragraph, his rights and obligations are governed by the preceding paragraph.   

### Article  87  

A party who is bound to take steps to preserve the goods may deposit them in a warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party provided that the expense incurred is not unreasonable.  

### Article  88  

(1).  A party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable delay by the other party in taking possession of the goods or in taking them back or in paying the price or the cost of preservation, provided that reasonable notice of the intention to sell has been given to the other party.   
(2).  If the goods are subject to rapid deterioration or their preservation would involve unreasonable expense, a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them. To the extent possible he must give notice to the other party of his intention to sell.   
(3).  A party selling the goods has the right to retain out of the proceeds of sale an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of preserving the goods and of selling them. He must account to the other party for the balance.

### DEEL  II  

####TOTSTANDKOMING VAN DE OVEREENKOMST

### Artikel  14  

1.  Een voorstel tot het sluiten van een overeenkomst, gericht tot één of meer bepaalde personen vormt een aanbod, indien het voldoende bepaald is en daaruit blijkt van de wil van de aanbieder om in geval van aanvaarding gebonden te zijn. Een voorstel is voldoende bepaald, indien daarin de zaken worden aangeduid en de hoeveelheid en de prijs uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend worden vastgesteld of bepaalbaar zijn.   
2.  Een ander voorstel dan een dat is gericht tot één of meer bepaalde personen dient louter te worden beschouwd als een uitnodiging tot het doen van een aanbod, tenzij door de persoon die het voorstel doet duidelijk het tegendeel wordt aangegeven.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Een aanbod wordt van kracht wanneer het de wederpartij bereikt.   
2.  Een aanbod kan, zelfs indien het onherroepelijk is, worden ingetrokken, indien de intrekking ervan de wederpartij eerder dan of gelijktijdig met het aanbod bereikt.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  Een aanbod kan worden herroepen totdat de overeenkomst is gesloten, indien die herroeping de wederpartij bereikt voordat deze een aanvaarding heeft verzonden.   
2.  Een aanbod kan echter niet worden herroepen: 

a. indien hierin, hetzij door het noemen van een vaste termijn voor aanvaarding, hetzij anderszins, wordt aangegeven dat het onherroepelijk is; of  

b. indien het redelijk was dat de wederpartij erop vertrouwde dat het onherroepelijk was en de wederpartij in vertrouwen op het aanbod heeft gehandeld.     

### Artikel  17  

Een aanbod vervalt, ook indien het onherroepelijk is, wanneer een verwerping de aanbieder bereikt.  

### Artikel  18  

1.  Een verklaring afgelegd door, of een andere gedraging van de wederpartij, waaruit blijkt van instemming met een aanbod, is een aanvaarding. Stilzwijgen of niet reageren geldt op zichzelf niet als aanvaarding.   
2.  Een aanvaarding van een aanbod wordt van kracht op het tijdstip waarop het blijk van instemming de aanbieder bereikt. Een aanvaarding is niet van kracht, indien het blijk van instemming de aanbieder niet bereikt binnen de door hem gestelde termijn of, indien er geen termijn is gesteld, binnen een redelijke termijn, in aanmerking genomen de omstandigheden van de transactie, waaronder de snelheid van de door de aanbieder gebezigde communicatiemiddelen. Een mondeling aanbod moet onmiddellijk worden aanvaard, tenzij uit de omstandigheden anders blijkt.   
3.  Indien echter op grond van het aanbod, de tussen partijen gebruikelijke handelwijzen of de gewoonte, de wederpartij van haar instemming kan doen blijken door het verrichten van een handeling, bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot de verzending van de zaken of het betalen van de prijs, zonder kennisgeving aan de aanbieder, is de aanvaarding van kracht op het tijdstip waarop de handeling wordt verricht, mits de handeling wordt verricht binnen de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde termijn.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  Een antwoord op een aanbod dat tot aanvaarding strekt, maar aanvullingen, beperkingen of andere wijzigingen bevat, geldt als een verwerping van het aanbod en vormt een tegenaanbod.   
2.  Bevat een tot aanvaarding strekkend antwoord op een aanbod aanvullingen of afwijkingen, die de voorwaarden van het aanbod niet wezenlijk aantasten, dan geldt dit niettemin als aanvaarding, tenzij de aanbieder, zonder onnodig uitstel, mondeling bezwaar maakt tegen de verschillen of een hiertoe strekkende kennisgeving verzendt. Doet hij dit niet, dan wordt de inhoud van de overeenkomst bepaald door de voorwaarden van het aanbod zoals gewijzigd bij de aanvaarding.   
3.  Aanvullende of afwijkende voorwaarden met betrekking tot onder andere de prijs, betaling, kwaliteit en hoeveelheid van de zaken, plaats en tijd van aflevering, omvang van aansprakelijkheid van één van beide partijen jegens de andere of de beslechting van geschillen worden geacht de voorwaarden van het aanbod wezenlijk aan te tasten.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  Een door de aanbieder in een telegram of een brief gestelde termijn voor aanvaarding gaat in op het tijdstip waarop het telegram aangeboden voor verzending of op de dag waarop de brief is gedateerd, of indien de brief niet is gedateerd, op de datum van het postmerk op de enveloppe. Een telefonisch, per telex of via een andere vorm van onmiddellijke communicatie gestelde termijn voor aanvaarding gaat in op het tijdstip waarop het aanbod de geadresseerde bereikt.   
2.  Officiële feestdagen of vrije dagen die vallen binnen de voor aanvaarding gestelde termijn worden bij de berekening van deze termijn inbegrepen. Indien een kennisgeving van aanvaarding niet kan worden afgegeven aan het adres van de aanbieder op de laatste dag van deze termijn, omdat deze valt op een officiële feestdag of een vrije dag op de plaats van vestiging van de aanbieder, wordt de termijn echter verlengd tot de eerstvolgende werkdag.   

### Artikel  21  

1.  Een te late aanvaarding geldt niettemin als aanvaarding, indien de aanbieder zulks zonder uitstel mondeling ter kennis brengt van de wederpartij, of een hiertoe strekkende kennisgeving verzendt.   
2.  Indien uit een brief of ander geschrift dat een te late aanvaarding bevat, blijkt dat verzending onder zodanige omstandigheden heeft plaatsgevonden dat hij bij normale overbrenging de aanbieder tijdig zou hebben bereikt, geldt de te late aanvaarding als aanvaarding, tenzij de aanbieder onverwijld de wederpartij mondeling verwittigt dat hij zijn aanbod als vervallen beschouwt of een hiertoe strekkende kennisgeving verzendt.   

### Artikel  22  

Een aanvaarding kan worden ingetrokken indien de intrekking de aanbieder bereikt vóór of op het tijdstip waarop de aanvaarding van kracht zou zijn geworden.  

### Artikel  23  

Een overeenkomst komt tot stand op het tijdstip waarop een aanvaarding van een aanbod van kracht wordt in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  24  

Voor de toepassing van dit Deel van het Verdrag „bereikt” een aanbod, een verklaring van aanvaarding of enige andere verklaring de wederpartij, wanneer die haar mondeling is gedaan of anderszins is afgegeven aan haar persoonlijk, aan haar vestiging of postadres, of, indien zij geen vestiging of postadres heeft, aan haar gewone verblijfplaats.  

### DEEL  III  

####KOOP VAN ROERENDE ZAKEN

### Hoofdstuk  1  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  25  

Een tekortkoming van een der partijen in de nakoming van de uit de overeenkomst voortvloeiende verbintenissen is wezenlijk, indien zij leidt tot zodanige schade voor de andere partij dat haar in aanmerkelijke mate wordt onthouden wat zij uit hoofde van de overeenkomst mag verwachten, tenzij de partij die tekort schiet, dit gevolg niet heeft voorzien en een redelijk persoon van dezelfde hoedanigheid in dezelfde omstandigheden het evenmin zou hebben voorzien.  

### Artikel  26  

Een verklaring van ontbinding van de overeenkomst is uitsluitend geldig indien zij geschiedt door middel van een kennisgeving aan de andere partij.  

### Artikel  27  

Indien een kennisgeving, verzoek of andere mededeling door een partij wordt gedaan in overeenstemming met dit Deel van het Verdrag en met in de omstandigheden passende middelen, ontneemt een vertraging of vergissing bij het overbrengen van de mededeling of het niet aankomen hiervan die partij niet het recht zich op de mededeling te beroepen, tenzij in dit Deel uitdrukkelijk anders wordt bepaald.  

### Artikel  28  

Indien in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in dit Verdrag een partij het recht heeft de nakoming van een verplichting door de andere partij te verlangen, is de rechter niet gehouden tot nakoming te veroordelen, tenzij de rechter dit op grond van zijn eigen recht eveneens zou doen met betrekking tot soortgelijke koopovereenkomsten, waarop dit Verdrag niet van toepassing is.  

### Artikel  29  

1.  Een overeenkomst kan worden gewijzigd of beëindigd door enkele wilsovereenstemming tussen de partijen.   
2.  Een bij geschrift gesloten overeenkomst die een bepaling bevat krachtens welke iedere wijziging of beëindiging door wilsovereenstemming bij geschrift dient te geschieden, kan niet op andere wijze door wilsovereenstemming worden gewijzigd of beëindigd. Het gedrag van een partij kan haar echter beletten zich op een zodanige bepaling te beroepen, voor zover de andere partij op dat gedrag heeft vertrouwd.   

### Hoofdstuk  II  

####VERPLICHTINGEN VAN DE VERKOPER

### Artikel  30  

De verkoper moet de zaken afleveren, zo nodig de documenten afgeven en de eigendom van de zaken overdragen, een en ander volgens de bepalingen van de overeenkomst en van dit Verdrag.  

### Afdeling  I  

#### *Aflevering van de roerende zaken en afgifte van documenten* 

### Artikel  31  

Indien de verkoper niet gehouden is de zaken op enige andere bepaalde plaats af te leveren, bestaat zijn verplichting tot aflevering: 

a. indien de koopovereenkomst tevens het vervoer van de zaken omvat - uit het afgeven van de zaken aan de eerste vervoerder ter verzending aan de koper;  

b. indien, in andere gevallen dan onder a bedoeld, de overeenkomst betrekking heeft op individueel bepaalde zaken, dan wel op naar de soort bepaalde zaken die van een bepaalde voorraad moeten worden afgenomen of die nog moeten worden vervaardigd of voortgebracht en de partijen op het tijdstip van het sluiten van de overeenkomst wisten dat de zaken zich bevonden, of moesten worden vervaardigd of voortgebracht, op een bepaalde plaats - uit het op die. plaats ter beschikking stellen van de zaken aan de koper;  

c. in andere gevallen - uit het ter beschikking stellen van de zaken aan de koper op de plaats waar de verkoper zijn vestiging had ten tijde van het sluiten van de overeenkomst.    

### Artikel  32  

1.  Indien de verkoper, in overeenstemming met de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag, de zaken afgeeft aan een vervoerder en indien de zaken niet duidelijk zijn bestemd tot uitvoering van de overeenkomst door merktekens, door verzendingsdocumenten of anderszins, moet de verkoper de koper in kennis stellen van de verzending, onder nauwkeurige omschrijving van de zaken.   
2.  Indien de verkoper gehouden is voor het vervoer van de zaken zorg te dragen, moet hij die overeenkomsten sluiten die nodig zijn voor het vervoer naar de vastgestelde plaats, zulks met in de omstandigheden passende vervoermiddelen en onder de voor zodanig vervoer gebruikelijke voorwaarden.   
3.  Indien de verkoper niet gehouden is een verzekering af te sluiten met betrekking tot het vervoer van de zaken, moet hij de koper op diens verzoek alle beschikbare informatie verstrekken die nodig is om hem in staat te stellen een zodanige verzekering af te sluiten.   

### Artikel  33  

De verkoper moet de zaken afleveren: 

a. indien er een datum is bepaald of bepaald kan worden op grond van de overeenkomst, op die datum;  

b. indien er een termijn is bepaald in of bepaald kan worden op grond van de overeenkomst, op enig tijdstip binnen de termijn, tenzij uit de omstandigheden blijkt dat de koper een datum moet kiezen; of  

c. in alle andere gevallen, binnen een redelijke termijn na het sluiten van de overeenkomst.    

### Artikel  34  

Indien de verkoper gehouden is documenten met betrekking tot de zaken af te geven, moet hij deze afgeven op het tijdstip, en op de plaats en in de vorm die door de overeenkomst worden vereist. Indien de verkoper vóór dat tijdstip documenten heeft afgegeven, kan hij tot op het voorgeschreven tijdstip eventuele onvolkomenheden in de documenten rechtzetten, indien de uitoefening van dit recht voor de koper geen onredelijk ongerief of onredelijke kosten meebrengt. De koper behoudt echter zijn recht op schadevergoeding overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.  

### Afdeling  II  

#### *Het beantwoorden van de zaken aan de overeenkomst en rechten van derden* 

### Artikel  35  

1.  De verkoper dient zaken af te leveren waarvan de hoeveelheid, de kwaliteit en de omschrijving voldoen aan de in de overeenkomst gestelde eisen en die zijn verpakt op de in de overeenkomst vereiste wijze.   
2.  Tenzij partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, beantwoorden de zaken slechts dan aan de overeenkomst, indien zij: 

a. geschikt zijn voor de doeleinden waarvoor zaken van dezelfde omschrijving gewoonlijk zouden worden gebruikt;  

b. geschikt zijn voor een bijzonder doel dat uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend aan de verkoper ter kennis is gebracht op het tijdstip van het sluiten van de overeenkomst, tenzij uit de omstandigheden blijkt dat de koper niet vertrouwde of redelijkerwijs niet mocht vertrouwen op de vakbekwaamheid en het oordeel van de verkoper;  

c. de hoedanigheden bezitten van zaken die de verkoper als monster of model aan de koper heeft aangeboden;  

d. zijn verpakt op de voor zodanige zaken gebruikelijke wijze of, indien er hiervoor geen gangbare handelwijze bestaat, op een met het oog op bescherming en behoud van de zaken passende wijze.     
3.  De verkoper is niet ingevolge het in het voorgaande lid onder a-d bepaalde aansprakelijk voor het niet beantwoorden van de zaken aan de overeenkomst, indien de koper op het tijdstip van het sluiten van de overeenkomst wist of had behoren te weten dat de zaken niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoordden.   

### Artikel  36  

1.  De verkoper is in overeenstemming met de overeenkomst en dit Verdrag aansprakelijk indien de zaken niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoorden op het tijdstip waarop het risico op de koper overgaat, ook al blijkt zulks eerst daarna.   
2.  De verkoper is tevens aansprakelijk voor elk niet beantwoorden van de zaken aan de overeenkomst hetwelk optreedt na het in het voorgaande lid genoemde tijdstip en te wijten is aan een tekortkoming in de nakoming van een van zijn verplichtingen, waaronder begrepen een garantie dat de zaken gedurende een bepaalde tijd geschikt zullen blijven voor het doel waarvoor zij normaal bestemd zijn of voor enigerlei bijzonder doel, dan wel nader aangegeven hoedanigheden of kenmerken zullen behouden.   

### Artikel  37  

Indien de verkoper zaken heeft afgeleverd vóór de afleveringsdatum, mag hij tot aan die datum een eventueel ontbrekend deel afleveren of een eventueel tekort in de afgeleverde hoeveelheid zaken aanvullen, dan wel zaken die niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoorden vervangen of herstellen, mits de uitoefening van dit recht voor de koper geen onredelijk ongerief of onredelijke kosten meebrengt. De koper behoudt echter zijn recht op schadevergoeding overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  38  

1.  De koper moet de zaken binnen een, gelet op de omstandigheden zo kort mogelijke, termijn keuren of doen keuren.   
2.  Indien de overeenkomst tevens het vervoer van de zaken omvat, kan de keuring worden uitgesteld tot na de aankomst van de zaken op hun bestemming.   
3.  Indien de koper de bestemming van de zaken onderweg wijzigt of hij deze doorzendt zonder dat hij redelijkerwijs gelegenheid heeft deze te keuren en de verkoper ten tijde van het sluiten van de overeenkomst de mogelijkheid van deze wijziging of doorzending kende of behoorde te kennen, kan de keuring worden uitgesteld tot het tijdstip waarop de zaken op de nieuwe bestemming zijn aangekomen.   

### Artikel  39  

1.  De koper verliest het recht om zich erop te beroepen dat de zaken niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoorden, indien hij niet binnen een redelijke termijn nadat hij dit heeft ontdekt of had behoren te ontdekken de verkoper hiervan in kennis stelt, onder opgave van de aard van de tekortkoming.   
2.  In ieder geval verliest de koper het recht om zich erop te beroepen dat de zaken niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoorden, indien hij de verkoper niet uiterlijk binnen een termijn van twee jaar na de datum waarop de zaken feitelijk aan de koper werden afgegeven, hiervan in kennis stelt, tenzij deze termijn niet overeenstemt met een in de overeenkomst opgenomen garantietermijn.   

### Artikel  40  

De verkoper kan zich niet beroepen op het bepaalde in de artikelen 38 en 39, indien het niet beantwoorden van de zaken aan de overeenkomst betrekking heeft op feiten die hij kende of waarvan hij niet onkundig had kunnen zijn en die hij niet aan de koper heeft bekend gemaakt.  

### Artikel  41  

De verkoper dient zaken te leveren waarop geen rechten of aanspraken van derden rusten, tenzij de koper ermee heeft ingestemd om de zaken onder die beperkingen aan te nemen. Indien een zodanig recht of een zodanige aanspraak is gebaseerd op industriële eigendom of op andere intellectuele eigendom, wordt de verplichting van de verkoper evenwel beheerst door artikel 42.  

### Artikel  42  

1.  De verkoper dient zaken af te leveren waarop geen rechten of aanspraken van derden rusten die zijn gebaseerd op industriële eigendom of andere intellectuele eigendom, waarmede de verkoper op het tijdstip waarop de overeenkomst werd gesloten, bekend was of waarvan hij niet onkundig had kunnen zijn, mits dat recht of die aanspraak is gebaseerd op industriële eigendom of andere intellectuele eigendom: 

a. ingevolge de wet van de Staat waar de zaken zullen worden doorverkocht of anderszins gebruikt, indien partijen op het tijdstip waarop de overeenkomst werd gesloten, onder ogen hebben gezien dat de zaken zouden worden doorverkocht of anderszins gebruikt in die Staat; of  

b. in alle andere gevallen, ingevolge de wet van de Staat waar de koper zijn vestiging heeft.     
2.  De verplichting van de verkoper krachtens het voorgaande lid geldt niet in gevallen waarin: 

a. de koper op het tijdstip waarop de overeenkomst werd gesloten bekend was met of niet onkundig had kunnen zijn van het recht of de aanspraak; of  

b. het recht of de aanspraak voortvloeit uit het feit dat de verkoper zich heeft gehouden aan door de koper verstrekte technische tekeningen, ontwerpen, formules of andere soortgelijke specificaties.     

### Artikel  43  

1.  De verkoper verliest het recht zich te beroepen op het bepaalde in de artikelen 41 en 42, indien hij nalaat binnen redelijke tijd nadat hij kennis kreeg of had behoren te krijgen van het recht of de aanspraak van de derde, de verkoper daarvan in kennis te stellen, onder nadere aanduiding van de aard van het recht of de aanspraak.   
2.  De verkoper is niet gerechtigd zich te beroepen op het bepaalde in het voorgaande lid, indien hij bekend was met het recht of de aanspraak van de derde en met de aard daarvan.   

### Artikel  44  

Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 39, eerste lid, en artikel 43, eerste lid, kan de koper de prijs verlagen in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in artikel 50 of, anders dan terzake van gederfde winst, schadevergoeding eisen indien hij een redelijke verontschuldiging heeft voor het feit dat hij de vereiste kennisgeving niet heeft gedaan.  

### Afdeling  III  

####Gevolgen van niet-nakoming van de verplichtingen van de verkoper

### Artikel  45  

1.  Indien de verkoper tekort schiet in de nakoming van een krachtens de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag op hem rustende verplichting, kan de koper: 

a. de in de artikelen 46 tot en met 52 vervatte rechten uitoefenen;  

b. schadevergoeding eisen, zoals voorzien in de artikelen 74 tot en met 77.     
2.  De koper verliest door uitoefening van andere rechten niet zijn eventuele recht op schadevergoeding.   
3.  Wanneer de koper een recht uitoefent terzake van een tekortkoming, kan een rechter of scheidsgerecht de verkoper geen uitstel verlenen.   

### Artikel  46  

1.  De koper kan nakoming door de verkoper van zijn verplichtingen eisen, tenzij de koper een recht heeft uitgeoefend dat onverenigbaar is met deze eis.   
2.  Indien de zaken niet beantwoorden aan de overeenkomst, kan de koper slechts aflevering van vervangende zaken eisen, indien de afwijking van het overeengekomene een wezenlijke tekortkoming vormt en een verzoek om vervangende zaken wordt gedaan hetzij in combinatie met een ingevolge artikel 39 gedane kennisgeving, hetzij binnen een redelijke termijn daarna.   
3.  Indien de zaken niet beantwoorden aan de overeenkomst, kan de koper van de verkoper herstel eisen, tenzij zulks, alle omstandigheden in aanmerking genomen, onredelijk is. Een verzoek tot herstel moet worden gedaan hetzij in combinatie met een ingevolge artikel 39 gedane kennisgeving, hetzij binnen een redelijke termijn daarna.   

### Artikel  47  

1.  De koper kan een aanvullende termijn van redelijke duur stellen voor het nakomen door de verkoper van zijn verplichtingen.   
2.  Tenzij de koper een kennisgeving van de verkoper heeft ontvangen dat deze niet binnen de aldus gestelde termijn zijn verplichtingen zal nakomen, mag de koper gedurende deze termijn geen rechten uitoefenen terzake van niet-nakoming. De koper verliest hierdoor echter niet zijn eventuele recht op schadevergoeding wegens te late nakoming.   

### Artikel  48  

1.  Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 49 mag de verkoper zelfs na de voor aflevering bepaalde datum op eigen kosten een eventuele tekortkoming in de nakoming van zijn verplichtingen herstellen, indien hij dit kan doen zonder onredelijke vertraging en zonder onredelijk ongerief voor de koper te veroorzaken of deze in het ongewisse te laten over de vergoeding door de verkoper van door de koper reeds gemaakte kosten. De koper behoudt echter zijn recht op schadevergoeding overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.   
2.  Indien de verkoper de koper verzoekt kenbaar te maken of hij de nakoming zal aanvaarden en de koper niet binnen een redelijke termijn op het verzoek reageert, kan de verkoper nakomen binnen de in zijn verzoek aangegeven termijn. De koper mag gedurende deze termijn geen rechten uitoefenen die onverenigbaar zijn met de nakoming door de verkoper.   
3.  Een kennisgeving van de verkoper dat hij binnen een nader omschreven termijn zal nakomen, wordt geacht een verzoek aan de koper ingevolge het voorgaande lid te omvatten om zijn beslissing kenbaar te maken.   
4.  Een verzoek of kennisgeving van de zijde van de verkoper ingevolge de leden 2 en 3 van dit artikel is slechts geldig indien het door de koper is ontvangen.   

### Artikel  49  

1.  De koper kan de overeenkomst ontbonden verklaren: 

a. indien de tekortkoming in de nakoming door de verkoper van de krachtens de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag op hem rustende verplichtingen een wezenlijke tekortkoming vormt; of  

b. in geval van niet aflevering, indien de verkoper de zaken niet aflevert binnen de door de koper in overeenstemming met artikel 47, eerste lid, gestelde aanvullende termijn of verklaart dat hij binnen de aldus gestelde termijn niet zal afleveren.     
2.  In gevallen waarin de verkoper de zaken heeft afgeleverd, verliest de koper echter het recht de overeenkomst ontbonden te verklaren, tenzij hij zulks doet: 

a. wegens te late levering, binnen een redelijke termijn nadat hij heeft geconstateerd dat de aflevering heeft plaats gevonden;  

b. wegens enige andere tekortkoming dan te late aflevering, binnen een redelijke termijn: 

(i) nadat hij de tekortkoming had ontdekt of had behoren te ontdekken;  

(ii) na het verstrijken van een door de koper in overeenstemming met artikel 47, eerste lid, gestelde aanvullende termijn, of nadat de verkoper heeft verklaard dat hij zijn verplichtingen niet binnen een zodanige aanvullende termijn zal nakomen; of  

(iii) na het verstrijken van een door de verkoper in overeenstemming met artikel 48, tweede lid, aangegeven aanvullende termijn, of nadat de koper heeft verklaard dat hij geen nakoming zal aanvaarden.       

### Artikel  50  

Indien de zaken niet beantwoorden aan de overeenkomst en ongeacht of de prijs reeds is betaald, kan de koper de prijs verlagen in dezelfde verhouding als waarin de waarde die de feitelijk afgeleverde zaken hadden op het tijdstip van aflevering staat tot de waarde die wel aan de overeenkomst beantwoordende zaken op dat tijdstip zouden hebben gehad. De koper mag de prijs echter niet verlagen, indien de verkoper in overeenstemming met artikel 37 of artikel 48 een tekortkoming in de nakoming van zijn verplichtingen herstelt of indien de koper weigert nakoming door de verkoper in overeenstemming met die artikelen te aanvaarden.  

### Artikel  51  

1.  Indien de verkoper slechts een gedeelte van de zaken aflevert of indien slechts een gedeelte van de afgeleverde zaken aan de overeenkomst beantwoordt, zijn de artikelen 46 tot en met 50 van toepassing met betrekking tot het gedeelte dat ontbreekt of dat niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoordt.   
2.  De koper kan slechts dan de overeenkomst in haar geheel ontbonden verklaren indien het feit dat slechts een gedeelte is afgeleverd of dat niet aan de overeenkomst beantwoordende zaken zijn afgeleverd een wezenlijke tekortkoming vormt.   

### Artikel  52  

1.  Indien de verkoper de zaken aflevert vóór de bepaalde datum, kan de koper de aflevering aanvaarden of afwijzen.   
2.  Indien de verkoper een grotere hoeveelheid zaken aflevert dan was overeengekomen, kan de koper de aflevering van het overschot aanvaarden of afwijzen. Aanvaardt de koper de Aflevering van het overschot geheel of gedeeltelijk, dan moet hij daarvoor in evenredigheid met de overeengekomen prijs betalen.   

### Hoofdstuk  III  

####VERPLICHTINGEN VAN DE KOPER

### Artikel  53  

De koper is verplicht de koopprijs te betalen en de zaken in ontvangst te nemen; een en ander in overeenstemming met de eisen van de overeenkomst en dit Verdrag.  

### Afdeling  I  

#### *Betaling van de koopprijs* 

### Artikel  54  

De verplichting van de koper om de prijs te betalen houdt tevens in dat hij de stappen onderneemt en formaliteiten vervult die krachtens de overeenkomst of eventuele wetten en voorschriften nodig zijn om de betaling mogelijk te maken.  

### Artikel  55  

Wanneer de koop rechtsgeldig is gesloten zonder dat de overeenkomst uitdrukkelijk of stilzwijgend de prijs bepaalt of in de wijze van bepaling daarvan voorziet, worden de partijen geacht, tenzij het tegendeel blijkt, zich stilzwijgend te hebben gehouden aan de prijs die ten tijde van het sluiten van de overeenkomst voor zodanige onder vergelijkbare omstandigheden verkochte zaken gewoonlijk wordt bedongen in de betrokken handelsbranche.  

### Artikel  56  

Wordt de prijs vastgesteld naar het gewicht van de zaken, dan is in geval van twijfel het netto-gewicht beslissend.  

### Artikel  57  

1.  Indien de koper niet gehouden is de prijs op een bepaalde andere plaats te betalen, dient hij de verkoper te betalen: 

a. ter plaatse van diens vestiging; of  

b. indien de betaling dient te geschieden tegen afgifte van de zaken of van documenten, ter plaatse van die afgifte.     
2.  De verkoper dient een verhoging van de aan de betaling verbonden kosten die het gevolg is van een verandering in zijn plaats van vestiging na het sluiten van de overeenkomst, voor zijn rekening te nemen.   

### Artikel  58  

1.  Indien de koper niet gehouden is de prijs op een nader aangegeven ander tijdstip te betalen, dient hij deze te betalen wanneer de verkoper hetzij de zaken, hetzij de daarop betrekking hebbende documenten ter beschikking stelt van de koper, zulks in overeenstemming met de overeenkomst en dit Verdrag. De verkoper kan een zodanige betaling als voorwaarde stellen voor de afgifte van de zaken of de documenten.   
2.  Indien de overeenkomst tevens het vervoer van de zaken omvat, kan de verkoper de goederen verzenden met het beding dat de zaken of de daarop betrekking hebbende documenten, slechts tegen betaling van de prijs aan de koper worden afgegeven.   
3.  De koper is niet verplicht tot betaling van de prijs voordat hij gelegenheid heeft gehad de zaken te keuren, tenzij de door partijen overeengekomen procedures voor aflevering of betaling met deze mogelijkheid niet verenigbaar zijn.   

### Artikel  59  

De koper dient de prijs te betalen op de in de overeenkomst bepaalde of aan de hand van de overeenkomst en dit Verdrag te bepalen datum, zonder dat de verkoper hierom behoeft te verzoeken of hiertoe enige formaliteit behoeft te vervullen.  

### Afdeling  II  

#### *Inontvangstneming van de zaken* 

### Artikel  60  

De verplichting van de koper tot inontvangstneming bestaat in: 

a. het verrichten van alle handelingen die redelijkerwijs van hem kunnen worden verwacht ten einde de verkoper tot aflevering in staat te stellen; en  

b. het tot zich nemen van de zaken.    

### Afdeling  III  

#### *Gevolgen van niet-nakoming van de verplichtingen van de koper* 

### Artikel  61  

1.  Indien de koper tekort schiet in de nakoming van de krachtens de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag op hem rustende verplichtingen, kan de verkoper: 

a. de in de artikelen 62 tot en met 65 vervatte rechten uitoefenen;  

b. schadevergoeding eisen, zoals bepaald in de artikelen 74 tot en met 77.     
2.  De verkoper verliest door uitoefening van andere rechten niet zijn eventuele recht op schadevergoeding.   
3.  Indien de verkoper een recht uitoefent terzake van een tekortkoming kan een rechter of scheidsgerecht de koper geen uitstel verlenen.   

### Artikel  62  

De verkoper kan van de koper eisen dat deze de prijs betaalt, de zaken in ontvangst neemt of zijn andere verplichtingen nakomt, tenzij de verkoper een recht heeft uitgeoefend dat onverenigbaar is met deze eis.  

### Artikel  63  

1.  De verkoper kan een aanvullende termijn van redelijke duur stellen voor het nakomen door de koper van zijn verplichtingen.   
2.  Tenzij de verkoper een kennisgeving van de koper heeft ontvangen dat deze niet binnen de aldus gestelde termijn zijn verplichtingen zal nakomen, mag de verkoper gedurende deze termijn geen rechten uitoefenen terzake van niet-nakoming. De verkoper verliest hierdoor echter niet zijn eventuele recht op schadevergoeding wegens te late nakoming.   

### Artikel  64  

1.  De verkoper kan de overeenkomst ontbonden verklaren: 

a. indien de tekortkoming in de nakoming door de koper van de krachtens de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag op hem rustende verplichtingen een wezenlijke tekortkoming vormt; of  

b. indien de koper niet, binnen de door de verkoper, in overeenstemming met artikel 63, eerste lid, gestelde aanvullende termijn zijn verplichting nakomt om de prijs te betalen of de zaken in ontvangst te nemen, of indien hij verklaart dat hij zulks niet binnen de aldus gestelde termijn zal doen.     
2.  In gevallen waarin de koper de prijs heeft betaald, verliest de verkoper echter het recht de overeenkomst ontbonden te verklaren, tenzij hij zulks doet: 

a. wegens te late nakoming door de koper, voordat de verkoper heeft geconstateerd dat nakoming heeft plaats gevonden; of  

b. wegens enige andere tekortkoming dan te late nakoming door de koper, binnen een redelijke termijn: 

(i) nadat de verkoper de tekortkoming had ontdekt of had behoren te ontdekken; of  

(ii) na het verstrijken van een door de verkoper in overeenstemming met artikel 63, eerste lid, gestelde aanvullende termijn, of nadat de koper heeft verklaard dat hij zijn verplichtingen niet binnen een zodanige aanvullende termijn zal nakomen.       

### Artikel  65  

1.  Indien de koper krachtens de overeenkomst de vorm, de afmeting of andere kenmerken van de zaken nader moet bepalen en hij deze specificatie niet op het overeengekomen tijdstip of binnen een redelijke termijn na ontvangst van een hiertoe strekkend verzoek van de verkoper verricht, kan de verkoper, onverminderd zijn eventuele andere rechten, zelf overgaan tot specificatie in overeenstemming met de behoeften van de koper, voor zover deze hem bekend zijn.   
2.  Gaat de verkoper zelf tot specificatie over, dan moet hij de bijzonderheden daarvan ter kennis van de koper brengen en hem een redelijke termijn toestaan voor een nadere specificatie. Maakt de koper na ontvangst van een zodanige mededeling niet binnen de gestelde termijn van deze mogelijkheid gebruik, dan is de door de verkoper verrichte specificatie bindend.   

### Hoofdstuk  IV  

####OVERGANG VAN HET RISICO

### Artikel  66  

Het verlies van of schade aan de zaken nadat het risico is overgegaan op de koper, ontslaat deze niet van de verplichting de prijs te betalen, tenzij het verlies of de schade te wijten is aan een handeling of nalatigheid van de verkoper.  

### Artikel  67  

1.  Indien de overeenkomst tevens het vervoer van de zaken omvat en de verkoper niet gehouden is deze op een bepaalde plaats af te geven, gaat het risico over op de koper wanneer de zaken aan de eerste vervoerder worden afgegeven ter verzending aan de koper in overeenstemming met de overeenkomst. Indien de verkoper gehouden is de zaken op een bepaalde plaats aan de vervoerder af te geven, gaat het risico eerst over op de koper wanneer de zaken op die plaats aan de vervoerder worden afgegeven. De omstandigheid dat de verkoper bevoegd is de op de zaken betrekking hebbende documenten te behouden, is niet van invloed op de overgang van het risico.   
2.  Desondanks gaat het risico niet over op de koper dan nadat de zaken duidelijk zijn bestemd tot uitvoering van de overeenkomst door merktekens, door verzendingsdocumenten, door kennisgeving aan de koper of anderszins.   

### Artikel  68  

Het risico met betrekking tot zaken die tijdens doorvoer zijn verkocht, gaat over op de koper vanaf het tijdstip van het sluiten van de overeenkomst. Indien de omstandigheden zulks uitwijzen, draagt de koper echter het risico vanaf het tijdstip waarop de zaken werden afgegeven aan de vervoerder die de documenten waarin de vervoerovereenkomst is neergelegd, heeft uitgegeven. Desondanks draagt de verkoper het risico van verlies of schade, indien de verkoper op het tijdstip waarop de koopovereenkomst werd gesloten ermee bekend was of had behoren te zijn dat de zaken verloren waren geraakt of waren beschadigd en hij dit niet aan de koper heeft meegedeeld.  

### Artikel  69  

1.  In gevallen die niet vallen onder de artikelen 67 en 68 gaat het risico over op de koper wanneer hij de zaken overneemt of, indien hij zulks niet tijdig doet, vanaf het tijdstip waarop de zaken aan hem ter beschikking worden gesteld en het niet in ontvangst nemen van de zaken een tekortkoming oplevert.   
2.  Indien de koper gehouden is de zaken over te nemen op een andere plaats dan een vestiging van de verkoper, gaat echter het risico over wanneer de verkoper verplicht is tot aflevering en de koper bekend is met het feit dat de zaken op die plaats te zijner beschikking worden gesteld.   
3.  Indien de overeenkomst betrekking heeft op nog niet geïdentificeerde zaken, worden de zaken eerst geacht ter beschikking van de koper te zijn gesteld, wanneer zij duidelijk zijn bestemd tot uitvoering van de overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  70  

Indien de verkoper zich heeft schuldig gemaakt aan een wezenlijke tekortkoming, doen de artikelen 67, 68 en 69 geen afbreuk aan de rechten die de koper terzake van deze tekortkoming ten dienste staan.  

### Hoofdstuk  V  

####BEPALINGEN DIE ZOWEL DE VERPLICHTINGEN VAN DE VERKOPER ALS DIE VAN DE KOPER BETREFFEN

### Afdeling  I  

#### *Toekomstige tekortkoming en overeenkomsten strekkende tot opeenvolgende afleveringen* 

### Artikel  71  

1.  Een partij mag de nakoming van haar verplichtingen opschorten, indien na het sluiten van de overeenkomst blijkt dat de andere partij een wezenlijk deel van haar verplichtingen niet zal nakomen ten gevolge van: 

a. een ernstig tekortschieten van haar vermogen om dat deel van haar verplichtingen na te komen, of van haar kredietwaardigheid; of  

b. haar gedrag bij de voorbereiding van de nakoming van de ingevolge de overeenkomst op haar rustende verplichtingen, dan wel bij de nakoming.     
2.  Heeft de verkoper de zaken reeds verzonden voordat de in het voorgaande lid omschreven gronden blijken, dan kan hij er zich tegen verzetten dat de zaken aan de koper worden afgegeven, zelfs al heeft de koper reeds een document in zijn bezit dat hem recht geeft de zaken te verwerven. Dit lid heeft uitsluitend betrekking op de rechten van koper en verkoper ten aanzien van de zaken.   
3.  Een partij die hetzij vóór, hetzij na verzending van de zaken de nakoming opschort, moet de andere partij onmiddellijk in kennis stellen van de opschorting en moet voortgaan met de nakoming, indien de andere partij voldoende zekerheid stelt voor de nakoming van haar verplichtingen.   

### Artikel  72  

1.  Indien het vóór de datum van nakoming duidelijk is dat één van de partijen zich schuldig zal maken aan een wezenlijke tekortkoming, kan de andere partij de overeenkomst ontbonden verklaren.   
2.  Indien de tijd dit toelaat, moet de partij die van plan is de overeenkomst ontbonden te verklaren, hiervan op redelijke wijze kennisgeving doen aan de andere partij, ten einde deze in staat te stellen voldoende zekerheid te stellen voor de nakoming van haar verplichtingen.   
3.  Het voorgaande lid is niet van toepassing indien de andere partij heeft verklaard dat zij haar verplichtingen niet zal nakomen.   

### Artikel  73  

1.  Indien bij een overeenkomst strekkende tot opeenvolgende afleveringen van zaken de tekortkoming van een partij in de nakoming van haar verplichtingen ten aanzien van één aflevering een wezenlijke tekortkoming ten aanzien van die aflevering vormt, kan de wederpartij de overeenkomst ten aanzien van die aflevering ontbonden verklaren.   
2.  Indien de tekortkoming in de nakoming van de verplichtingen ten aanzien van een der afleveringen door een van de partijen aan de wederpartij gegronde reden geeft om te concluderen dat er ten aanzien van de toekomstige afleveringen een wezenlijke tekortkoming zal plaatsvinden, kan zij, mits binnen redelijke termijn, de overeenkomst voor de toekomst ontbonden verklaren.   
3.  Een koper die de overeenkomst ontbonden verklaart met betrekking tot een aflevering, kan tegelijkertijd de overeenkomst ontbonden verklaren ten aanzien van reeds ontvangen of toekomstige afleveringen, indien die afleveringen wegens hun onderlinge samenhang niet kunnen worden gebruikt voor het door partijen ten tijde van het sluiten van de overeenkomst beoogde doel.   

### Afdeling  II  

####Schadevergoeding

### Artikel  74  

De schadevergoeding wegens een tekortkoming van een partij bestaat uit een bedrag gelijk aan de schade, met inbegrip van de gederfde winst, die door de andere partij als gevolg van de tekortkoming wordt geleden. Een zodanige schadevergoeding mag evenwel niet hoger zijn dan de schade die de partij die in de nakoming is tekort geschoten bij het sluiten van de overeenkomst voorzag of had behoren te voorzien als mogelijk gevolg van de tekortkoming, gegeven de feiten die zij kende of die zij had behoren te kennen.  

### Artikel  75  

Indien de overeenkomst wordt ontbonden en de koper of de verkoper op een redelijke wijze en binnen een redelijke termijn na de ontbinding een dekkingskoop heeft gesloten, komt aan de partij die schadevergoeding eist, het verschil toe tussen de overeengekomen prijs en die van de dekkingskoop, onverminderd haar recht op vergoeding van andere schade overeenkomstig artikel 74.  

### Artikel  76  

1.  In geval van ontbinding van de overeenkomst heeft, indien de zaken een dagprijs hebben, de partij die schadevergoeding eist, zo zij niet is overgegaan tot een dekkingskoop als bedoeld in artikel 75, recht op het verschil tussen de in de overeenkomst bepaalde prijs en de ten tijde van de ontbinding geldende dagprijs, onverminderd haar recht op vergoeding van andere schade overeenkomstig artikel 74. Indien evenwel de partij die schadevergoeding eist de overeenkomst heeft ontbonden na de zaken te hebben overgenomen, wordt de dagprijs ten tijde van die overname gehanteerd in plaats van de dagprijs ten tijde van de ontbinding.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van het vorige lid, is de dagprijs die welke geldt op de plaats waar de zaken hadden moeten worden afgeleverd, of, indien er op die plaats geen dagprijs is, de prijs op een andere plaats die deze redelijkerwijs kan vervangen; hierbij wordt rekening gehouden met de verschillen in de kosten van vervoer van de zaken.   

### Artikel  77  

Een partij die zich beroept op een tekortkoming moet de in de gegeven omstandigheden redelijke maatregelen treffen tot beperking van de uit de tekortkoming voortvloeiende schade, met inbegrip van de gederfde winst. Laat zij zodanige maatregelen na, dan kan de partij die in de nakoming is tekort geschoten een vermindering van de schadevergoeding verlangen ten belope van het bedrag waarmee het verlies had moeten worden beperkt.  

### Afdeling  III  

####Rente

### Artikel  78  

Indien een partij tekort schiet in de betaling van de prijs of van enig ander achterstallig bedrag, heeft de andere partij recht op rente hierover, onverminderd haar recht op schadevergoeding overeenkomstig artikel 74.  

### Afdeling  IV  

#### *Bevrijdende omstandigheden* 

### Artikel  79  

1.  Een partij is niet aansprakelijk voor een tekortkoming in de nakoming van een van haar verplichtingen, indien zij aantoont dat de tekortkoming werd veroorzaakt door een verhindering die buiten haar macht lag en dat van haar redelijkerwijs niet kon worden verwacht dat zij bij het sluiten van de overeenkomst met die verhindering rekening zou hebben gehouden of dat zij deze of de gevolgen ervan zou hebben vermeden of te boven zou zijn gekomen.   
2.  Indien de tekortkoming van de partij te wijten is aan een tekortkoming van een derde die door haar is belast met de uitvoering van de gehele overeenkomst of een gedeelte hiervan, wordt die partij slechts van haar aansprakelijkheid bevrijd, indien: 

a. zij krachtens het vorige lid hiervan wordt bevrijd; en  

b. de derde bevrijd zou zijn, indien het bepaalde in dat lid op hem van toepassing zou zijn.     
3.  De in dit artikel bedoelde bevrijding geldt voor het tijdvak gedurende hetwelk de verhindering bestaat.   
4.  De partij die tekort schiet in de nakoming van haar verplichtingen, dient de andere partij in kennis te stellen van de verhindering en van de gevolgen hiervan voor haar vermogen om na te komen. Indien de kennisgeving niet door de andere partij wordt ontvangen binnen een redelijke termijn nadat de partij die tekortschiet met de verhindering bekend was of had behoren te zijn, is deze laatste aansprakelijk voor de uit het niet-ontvangen van de desbetreffende kennisgeving voortvloeiende schade.   
5.  Niets in dit artikel verhindert partijen krachtens dit Verdrag enig ander recht dan dat op schadevergoeding, uit te oefenen.   

### Artikel  80  

Een partij kan zich niet beroepen op een tekortkoming van de andere partij voor zover die tekortkoming werd veroorzaakt door een handeling of nalatigheid van eerstgenoemde partij.  

### Afdeling  V  

#### *Gevolgen van de ontbinding* 

### Artikel  81  

De ontbinding bevrijdt beide partijen van hun verplichtingen uit de overeenkomst, onverminderd een eventueel verschuldigde schadevergoeding. Ontbinding is niet van invloed op een bepaling van de overeenkomst met betrekking tot de beslechting van geschillen of op andere bepalingen van de overeenkomst die de rechten en verplichtingen van partijen na ontbinding van de overeenkomst regelen. 

2. Een partij die de overeenkomst geheel of ten dele heeft uitgevoerd, kan van de andere partij teruggave eisen van hetgeen zij uit hoofde van de overeenkomst heeft gepresteerd. Hebben beide partijen het recht teruggave te vorderen, dan moet deze teruggave over en weer gelijktijdig geschieden.    

### Artikel  82  

1.  De koper verliest het recht de overeenkomst ontbonden te verklaren of van de verkoper te eisen dat deze vervangende zaken aflevert, indien het hem onmogelijk is de zaken goeddeels in dezelfde staat terug te geven als waarin hij deze heeft ontvangen.   
2.  Het vorige lid is niet van toepassing: 

a. indien de onmogelijkheid om de zaken terug te geven of deze terug te geven in goeddeels dezelfde staat als waarin de koper deze heeft ontvangen, niet is te wijten aan zijn handelingen of nalaten;  

b. indien de zaken of een gedeelte daarvan zijn verloren gegaan of in waarde zijn verminderd als gevolg van de in artikel 38 voorgeschreven keuring; of  

c. indien de koper de zaken of een gedeelte daarvan in de normale uitoefening van zijn bedrijf heeft verkocht of in overeenstemming met een normale wijze van gebruiken heeft verbruikt of verwerkt, alvorens hij ontdekte of had behoren te ontdekken dat deze niet beantwoordden aan de overeenkomst.     

### Artikel  83  

Een koper die het recht verloren heeft de overeenkomst ontbonden te verklaren of van de verkoper te eisen dat deze in overeenstemming met artikel 82 vervangende zaken aflevert, behoudt alle andere rechr ten die de overeenkomst en dit Verdrag hem toekennen.  

### Artikel  84  

1.  Indien de verkoper gehouden is de prijs terug te betalen moet hij hierover tevens rente betalen vanaf het tijdstip waarop de prijs werd betaald.   
2.  De koper moet aan de verkoper de waarde vergoeden van elk voordeel dat hij van de zaken of een gedeelte daarvan heeft genoten: 

a. indien hij de zaken of een gedeelte daarvan moet teruggeven; of  

b. indien het hem onmogelijk is alle zaken of een gedeelte daarvan terug te geven of alle zaken of een gedeelte daarvan goeddeels in dezelfde staat terug te geven als waarin hij deze heeft ontvangen, maar hij de overeenkomst desondanks ontbonden heeft verklaard of van de verkoper heeft geëist dat deze vervangende zaken aflevert.     

### Afdeling  VI  

#### *Zorg voor behoud van de zaken* 

### Artikel  85  

Indien de koper nalatig is met de inontvangstneming van de zaken of indien hij, wanneer de prijs dient te worden betaald bij aflevering van de zaken, in gebreke blijft de prijs te betalen en de verkoper hetzij de zaken onder zich heeft, hetzij daarover anderszins zeggenschap kan uitoefenen, moet de verkoper alle in de omstandigheden redelijke maatregelen voor het behoud van de zaken treffen. Hij heeft het recht deze onder zich te houden totdat hij door de koper voor de door hem in redelijkheid gemaakte kosten schadeloos is gesteld.  

### Artikel  86  

1.  Indien de koper de zaken heeft ontvangen en hij voornemens is enigerlei recht krachtens de overeenkomst of dit Verdrag uit te oefenen om deze te weigeren, moet hij alle in de omstandigheden redelijke maatregelen voor het behoud van de zaken treffen. Hij heeft het recht deze onder zich te houden totdat hij door de verkoper voor de door hem in redelijkheid gemaakte kosten schadeloos is gesteld.   
2.  Indien de aan de koper verzonden zaken op hun plaats van bestemming te zijner beschikking zijn gesteld, en hij het recht om deze te weigeren, uitoefent, moet hij deze voor rekening van de verkoper onder zich nemen, mits dit kan geschieden zonder betaling van de prijs en zonder onredelijk ongerief of onredelijke kosten. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing, indien de verkoper op de plaats van bestemming aanwezig is of iemand aldaar bevoegd is de zaken voor diens rekening onder zijn hoede te nemen. Indien de koper de zaken onder zich neemt ingevolge dit lid, worden zijn rechten en verplichtingen beheerst door het vorige lid.   

### Artikel  87  

Een partij die gehouden is maatregelen voor het behoud van de zaken te treffen, kan deze voor rekening van de andere partij in bewaring geven in de opslagruimte van een derde, mits de hieruit voortvloeiende kosten niet onredelijk zijn.  

### Artikel  88  

1.  Een partij die in overeenstemming met de artikelen 85 of 86 gehouden is voor het behoud van de zaken te zorgen kan deze op een geschikte wijze verkopen, indien de wederpartij bij het aanvaarden of terugnemen van de zaken of bij de betaling van de prijs of de kosten van bewaring een onredelijk grote vertraging laat ontstaan, mits zij de wederpartij op redelijke wijze kennis heeft gegeven van haar voornemen om te verkopen.   
2.  Indien de zaken aan snelle achteruitgang onderhevig zijn of de bewaring ervan onredelijke kosten zou meebrengen, moet een partij die in overeenstemming met de artikelen 85 of 86 gehouden is voor het behoud van de zaken te zorgen redelijke maatregelen treffen om deze te verkopen. Voor zover mogelijk moet zij de wederpartij van haar voornemen om te verkopen in kennis stellen.   
3.  Een partij die de zaken verkoopt, mag van de opbrengst afhouden het bedrag van de uitgaven die in redelijkheid gedaan zijn voor het behoud van de zaken en voor de verkoop daarvan. Zij moet het overblijvende aan de wederpartij afdragen.
