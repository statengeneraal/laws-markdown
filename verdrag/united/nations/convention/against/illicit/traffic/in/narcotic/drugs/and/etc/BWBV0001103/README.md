####Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties tegen de sluikhandel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen

De Partijen bij dit Verdrag, Ten zeerste verontrust door de omvang en de groei van de clandestiene produktie van, de vraag naar en de handel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, die een ernstige bedreiging vormen voor de gezondheid en het welzijn van mensen en de economische, culturele en politieke fundamenten van de samenleving aantasten, Eveneens ten zeerste verontrust door het feit dat de sluikhandel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen in toenemende mate in verschillende maatschappelijke groepen weet binnen te dringen, en met name door het feit dat kinderen in vele delen van de wereld worden misbruikt als consumenten op de markt van verboden verdovende middelen, en worden gebruikt voor de clandestiene produktie en distributie van en handel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, hetgeen een uiterst ernstig gevaar vormt, De verbanden erkennende tussen sluikhandel en andere, verwante, georganiseerde misdadige praktijken die de legale economieën ondermijnen en een bedreiging vormen voor de stabiliteit, de veiligheid en de soevereiniteit van Staten, Tevens erkennende dat sluikhandel een vorm van internationale misdadige activiteit is, de bestrijding waarvan dringende aandacht en de hoogste prioriteit vereist, Zich bewust van het feit dat sluikhandel grote geldelijke voordelen en rijkdom oplevert, waardoor internationale misdadige organisaties in staat worden gesteld bestuurlijke structuren, de legale commerciële en financiële bedrijvigheid en de samenleving op al haar niveaus binnen te dringen, te besmetten en aan te tasten, Vastbesloten personen die betrokken zijn bij sluikhandel de opbrengsten van hun misdadige praktijken te ontnemen en daardoor hun belangrijkste drijfveer voor deze praktijken weg te nemen, Geleid door de wens de grondoorzaken van het probleem van misbruik van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen weg te nemen, waaronder begrepen de illegale vraag naar dergelijke middelen en stoffen en de enorme winsten die uit sluikhandel worden verworven, Overwegende dat maatregelen nodig zijn om toezicht te houden op bepaalde stoffen, waaronder begrepen precursoren, chemicaliën en oplosmiddelen, die worden gebruikt bij de vervaardiging van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, en die gemakkelijk verkrijgbaar zijn, waardoor de illegale vervaardiging van deze middelen en stoffen in omvang is toegenomen, Vastbesloten de internationale samenwerking in de bestrijding van sluikhandel over zee te verbeteren, Erkennende dat de uitroeiing van sluikhandel een gezamenlijke verantwoordelijkheid van alle Staten is, en dat hiertoe gecoördineerde maatregelen in het kader van internationale samenwerking nodig zijn, Erkennende dat de Verenigde Naties bevoegd zijn op het gebied van toezicht op verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, en geleid door de wens dat de desbetreffende internationale organen zich binnen het kader van die Organisatie met dit toezicht bezighouden. Opnieuw de leidende beginselen bevestigend van bestaande verdragen op het gebied van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen en van het geheel van maatregelen van toezicht dat zij omvatten, Erkennende dat het noodzakelijk is de maatregelen voorzien in het Enkelvoudig Verdrag inzake verdovende middelen van 1961, in dat Verdrag zoals gewijzigd door het Protocol van 1972 tot wijziging van het Enkelvoudig Verdrag inzake verdovende middelen van 1961, en in het Verdrag inzake psychotrope stoffen van 1971, te versterken en aan te vullen teneinde de omvang en de reikwijdte van de sluikhandel en de ernstige gevolgen ervan het hoofd te bieden; Tevens erkennende dat het van groot belang is de doeltreffendheid van wettelijke middelen voor internationale samenwerking in strafzaken te vergroten en te bevorderen ter bestrijding van de internationale misdadige praktijken die samenhangen met de sluikhandel; Geleid door de wens een allesomvattend en doeltreffend internationaal verdrag te sluiten dat in het bijzonder is gericht tegen de sluikhandel en dat de verschillende aspecten van het probleem als geheel benadert, in het bijzonder die aspecten die niet in overweging zijn genomen in de bestaande verdragen op het gebied van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, Komen overeen als volgt:

### Artikel  3  

####Strafbare feiten en straffen

1.  Elke Partij neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn om de volgende feiten, indien opzettelijk begaan, strafbaar te stellen krachtens haar nationale wetgeving:

(ii) het verhelen of verhullen van de werkelijke aard, oorsprong, vindplaats, vervreemding, verplaatsing, rechten op of de eigendom van voorwerpen, wetende dat deze voorwerpen zijn verworven uit één of meer van de in overeenstemming met letter (a) van dit lid strafbaar gestelde feiten, of uit deelneming aan één of meer van deze strafbare feiten;    

c. Met inachtneming van haar grondwettelijke beginselen en de grondbeginselen van haar rechtsstelsel: 

(i) de verwerving, het bezit of het gebruik van voorwerpen, wetende, op het tijdstip van verkrijging, dat deze voorwerpen zijn verworven uit één of meer van de in overeenstemming met letter (a) van dit lid strafbaar gestelde feiten of uit deelneming aan één of meer van deze strafbare feiten.  

(ii) het bezit van benodigdheden of materialen of van in Tabel I en Tabel II genoemde stoffen, wetende dat deze worden of zijn bestemd om te worden gebruikt bij of voor de illegale teelt, produktie of vervaardiging van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen;

2.  Met inachtneming van haar grondwettelijke beginselen en de grondbeginselen van haar rechtsstelsel dient elke Partij de maatregelen te nemen die nodig zijn om, in overeenstemming met haar nationale wetgeving strafbaar te stellen, indien opzettelijk begaan: het bezit, de aankoop of de teelt van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen voor persoonlijk gebruik in strijd met de bepalingen van het Verdrag van 1961, het Verdrag van 1961 zoals gewijzigd of het Verdrag van 1971.   
3.  Medeweten, oogmerk, of opzet, vereist als bestanddeel van een in het eerste lid van dit artikel omschreven strafbaar feit, kunnen worden afgeleid uit objectieve feitelijke omstandigheden.   
4.  

a. Elke Partij stelt op het begaan van de in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel strafbaar gestelde feiten, straffen evenredig aan de ernst van deze strafbare feiten, zoals gevangenisstraf of andere tot vrijheidsbeneming strekkende straffen, geldstraffen en confiscatie.  

b. De Partijen kunnen bepalen dat, naast veroordeling of bestraffing wegens een in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel strafbaar gesteld feit, de dader maatregelen moet ondergaan als behandeling, opvoeding, nazorg, wederaanpassing aan of wederopneming in de maatschappij.  

c. Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in de voorgaande letters van dit lid kunnen de Partijen, in geval van overtredingen van minder ernstige aard, in plaats van veroordeling of bestraffing, voorzien in maatregelen als opvoeding, wederaanpassing aan of wederopneming in de maatschappij, alsook, indien de dader verslaafd is aan verdovende middelen, behandeling en nazorg.  

d. De Partijen kunnen, in plaats van veroordeling of bestraffing van een in overeenstemming met het tweede lid van dit artikel strafbaar gesteld feit, voorzien in maatregelen met het oog op de behandeling, opvoeding, nazorg, wederaanpassing aan of wederopneming in de maatschappij van de dader.     
5.  De Partijen dragen er zorg voor dat hun gerechtelijke en andere bevoegde rechtsmacht uitoefenende autoriteiten feitelijke omstandigheden in aanmerking kunnen nemen waardoor de in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel strafbaar gestelde feiten als bijzonder ernstig kunnen worden aangemerkt, zoals: 

a. het feit dat bij het strafbare feit een georganiseerde misdadige groep is betrokken waarvan de dader deel uitmaakt;  

b. het feit dat de dader bij andere internationale georganiseerde misdadige activiteiten is betrokken;  

c. het feit dat de dader is betrokken bij andere onwettige activiteiten, die door het begaan van het strafbare feit worden vergemakkelijkt;  

d. het gebruik van geweld of wapens door de dader;  

e. het feit dat de dader een openbaar ambt bekleedt en dat het strafbare feit met dat ambt verband houdt;  

f. het feit dat minderjarigen tot slachtoffer worden gemaakt of worden gebruikt;  

g. het feit dat het strafbare feit wordt begaan in een strafinrichting of in een opvoedingsinstituut of in het gebouw van een maatschappelijke instelling of in hun onmiddellijke omgeving, of op andere plaatsen waar scholieren en studenten samenkomen voor onderwijs, sport en andere gezamenlijke bezigheden;  

h. eerdere veroordeling, in het bijzonder voor gelijksoortige strafbare feiten, begaan hetzij in het buitenland hetzij in eigen land, voor zover toegelaten volgens de nationale wetgeving van een Partij.     
6.  De Partijen streven ernaar te verzekeren dat wettelijke bevoegdheden, die door hun nationale recht worden toegekend bij de beoordeling van de opportuniteit van de vervolging van personen wegens de in overeenstemming met dit artikel strafbaar gestelde feiten, zodanig worden uitgeoefend dat de opsporing en rechtshandhaving ten aanzien van deze strafbare feiten zo doeltreffend mogelijk is, mede met het oog op de noodzaak personen te weerhouden van het begaan van deze strafbare feiten.   
7.  De Partijen dragen er zorg voor dat hun gerechtelijke instanties of andere bevoegde autoriteiten de ernst van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel opgesomde strafbare feiten en de in het vijfde lid van dit artikel opgesomde omstandigheden in aanmerking nemen wanneer zij de mogelijkheid overwegen van vervroegde of voorwaardelijke in vrijheid stelling van personen die voor deze strafbare feiten zijn veroordeeld.   
8.  Waar dat dienstig wordt geacht, stelt iedere Partij binnen het raam van haar nationale wetgeving een lange verjaringstermijn vast, binnen welke tot vervolging dient te worden overgegaan wegens een in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel strafbaar gesteld feit. Deze termijn zal langer zijn wanneer de vermoedelijke dader zich onttrekt aan de rechtshandhaving.   
9.  Elke Partij neemt, in overeenstemming met haar rechtsstelsel, passende maatregelen om te verzekeren dat een ieder die wordt verdacht van, of is veroordeeld wegens een in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van dit artikel strafbaar gesteld feit, en die op haar grondgebied wordt aangetroffen, bij het strafproces aanwezig is.   
10.  Ten behoeve van de samenwerking tussen de Partijen krachtens dit Verdrag, waaronder in het bijzonder begrepen de samenwerking krachtens de artikelen 5,6,7 en 9, worden in overeenstemming met dit artikel strafbaar gestelde feiten niet beschouwd als fiscale of politieke delicten of als delicten die op politieke motieven berusten, zulks onverminderd de grondwettelijke beperkingen en de fundamentele nationale wetgeving van de Partijen.   
11.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel doet afbreuk aan het beginsel dat de omschrijving van de hierin bedoelde strafbare feiten en van desbetreffende rechtsmiddelen is voorbehouden aan het nationale recht van een Partij, en dat deze strafbare feiten in overeenstemming met dat recht worden vervolgd en bestraft.   

### Artikel  4  

####Rechtsmacht

2.  Elke Partij: 

a. neemt eveneens de maatregelen die nodig zijn om haar rechtsmacht te vestigen met betrekking tot de in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten, wanneer de vermoedelijke dader zich op haar grondgebied bevindt en zij hem niet uitlevert aan een andere Partij op grond dat: 

(i) het strafbare feit is begaan op haar grondgebied of aan boord van een vaartuig dat haar vlag voerde of aan boord van een luchtvaartuig dat volgens haar wetten was te boek gesteld op het tijdstip dat het strafbare feit werd begaan; of

6.  

a. Indien opbrengsten in andere voorwerpen zijn omgezet, worden in plaats van de opbrengsten deze voorwerpen onderworpen aan de in dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen.  

b. Indien opbrengsten met uit wettige bronnen verworven voorwerpen zijn vermengd, worden deze voorwerpen, onverminderd bevoegdheden tot inbeslagneming of bevriezing, geconfisqueerd tot de hoogte van de getaxeerde waarde van de vermengde opbrengsten.  

c. Inkomsten of andere voordelen verworven uit: 

(i) opbrengsten;  

(ii) voorwerpen waarin de opbrengsten zijn omgezet;  

(iii) voorwerpen waarmede de opbrengsten zijn vermengd worden eveneens aan de in dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen onderworpen, op dezelfde wijze en in dezelfde mate als opbrengsten.       
7.  Elke Partij kan bepalen dat de bewijslast wordt omgedraaid ten aanzien van de wettige oorsprong van vermeende opbrengsten of andere voorwerpen die vatbaar zijn voor confiscatie, in de mate waarin zulks strookt met de beginselen van haar nationale wetgeving en met de aard van de gerechtelijke en andere procedures.   
8.  De bepalingen van dit artikel mogen niet zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor de rechten van derden te goeder trouw worden geschaad.   
9.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel doet afbreuk aan het beginsel dat de hierin bedoelde maatregelen worden omschreven en ten uitvoer gelegd in overeenstemming met en met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het nationale recht van een Partij.   

### Artikel  6  

####Uitlevering

1.  Dit artikel is van toepassing op de in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten.   
2.  Elk van de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt geacht in elk tussen Partijen bestaand uitleveringsverdrag te zijn begrepen als een uitleveringsdelict. De Partijen verplichten zich ertoe dergelijke strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
3.  Indien een Partij, die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Partij, waarmee zij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan zij dit Verdrag beschouwen als de wettelijke basis voor uitlevering wegens de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is. De Partijen die nadere wetgeving behoeven teneinde dit Verdrag te gebruiken als wettelijke basis voor uitlevering, dienen te overwegen daar waar nodig dergelijke wetgeving tot stand te brengen.   
4.  De Partijen die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen in hun onderlinge betrekkingen de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is als uitleveringsdelicten.   
5.  Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de voorwaarden bepaald in de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij of in toepasselijke uitleveringsverdragen, met inbegrip van de gronden waarop de aangezochte Partij uitlevering kan weigeren.   
6.  Bij de beoordeling van verzoeken die ingevolge dit artikel worden ontvangen, kan de aangezochte Partij weigeren deze in te willigen indien haar rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteiten gegronde redenen hebben om aan te nemen dat uitlevering de vervolging of bestraffing van een persoon op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit of politieke denkbeelden zou bevorderen, of om één of meer van deze redenen nadelig zou zijn voor degene(n) op wie het verzoek betrekking heeft.   
7.  De Partijen streven ernaar uitleveringsprocedures te bespoedigen en de vereisten betreffende bewijslevering in dergelijke procedures te vereenvoudigen met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is.   
8.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van haar nationale wetgeving en haar uitleveringsverdragen kan de aangezochte Partij, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden dit rechtvaardigen en dringend zijn, en op verzoek van de verzoekende Partij, een persoon wiens uitlevering wordt verzocht en die zich op haar grondgebied bevindt, in hechtenis nemen of andere passende maatregelen nemen om zijn aanwezigheid bij de uitleveringsprocedure te verzekeren.   
9.  Onverminderd de uitoefening van strafrechtelijke rechtsmacht, gevestigd in overeenstemming met haar nationale recht, dient een Partij op het grondgebied waarvan een vermoedelijke dader wordt aangetroffen: 

a. indien zij hem op de gronden genoemd in artikel 4, tweede lid, letter a, niet uitlevert wegens een in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gesteld feit, de zaak voor te leggen aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten zodat betrokkene kan worden vervolgd, tenzij met de verzoekende Partij anders is overeengekomen;  

b. indien zij hem niet uitlevert wegens een dergelijk strafbaar feit en haar rechtsmacht met betrekking tot dat strafbare feit heeft gevestigd in overeenstemming met artikel 4, tweede lid, letter b, de zaak voor te leggen aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten zodat betrokkene kan worden vervolgd, tenzij door de verzoekende Partij anders is verzocht teneinde haar legitieme rechtsmacht veilig te stellen.     
10.  Indien uitlevering wordt verzocht teneinde een straf ten uitvoer te kunnen leggen, en indien deze wordt geweigerd omdat de betrokkene een onderdaan van de aangezochte Partij is, overweegt de aangezochte Partij, indien haar wetgeving dit toelaat en dit in overeenstemming is met de vereisten van deze wetgeving, op aanvraag van de verzoekende Partij de straf die is opgelegd krachtens het recht van de verzoekende Partij of het resterende gedeelte daarvan ten uitvoer te leggen.   
11.  De Partijen streven ernaar bilaterale en multilaterale overeenkomsten te sluiten teneinde uitlevering mogelijk te maken of de doeltreffendheid ervan te verhogen.   
12.  De Partijen kunnen overwegen bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten te sluiten, waarin hetzij op ad hoc basis, hetzij algemeen geldend, regelingen worden getroffen over de overbrenging naar hun land van personen die zijn veroordeeld tot gevangenisstraf of andere tot vrijheidsbeneming strekkende sancties wegens strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, met het doel hen aldaar hun straftijd te doen uitzitten.   

### Artikel  7  

####Wederzijdse rechtshulp

1.  De Partijen verlenen elkaar ingevolge dit artikel de ruimste mate van wederzijdse rechtshulp in onderzoeken, vervolgingen en gerechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot feiten die in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar zijn gesteld.   
2.  Wederzijdse rechtshulp, die in overeenstemming met dit artikel wordt verleend, kan worden verzocht voor de volgende doeleinden: 

a. het afnemen van getuigenissen of verklaringen van personen;  

b. het betekenen van gerechtelijke stukken;  

c. het uitvoeren van huiszoekingen en inbeslagnemingen;  

d. het onderzoeken van voorwerpen en terreinen;  

e. het verstrekken van gegevens en bewijsmateriaal;  

f. het verstrekken van originele exemplaren of gewaarmerkte afschriften van terzake dienende documenten en dossiers, waaronder begrepen bankdossiers, financiële stukken, ondernemingsbescheiden of commerciële dossiers;  

g. het identificeren of opsporen van opbrengsten, voorwerpen, hulpmiddelen of andere zaken voor het leveren van bewijs.     
3.  De Partijen kunnen elkaar alle andere vormen van wederzijdse rechtshulp verlenen die zijn toegestaan volgens de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij.   
4.  Op verzoek dienen de Partijen, voor zover verenigbaar met hun nationale wetgeving en praktijk, te vergemakkelijken of te bevorderen dat diegenen, die zich bereid verklaren bij onderzoeken te helpen of aan een procedure deel te nemen, waaronder begrepen personen in detentie, aanwezig of beschikbaar zijn.   
5.  Een Partij kan niet het bankgeheim inroepen als grond om te weigeren wederzijdse rechtshulp krachtens dit artikel te verlenen.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel laten onverlet de verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit andere bilaterale of multilaterale verdragen, waarbij wederzijdse rechtshulp in strafzaken geheel of gedeeltelijk is of zal worden geregeld.   
7.  Het achtste lid tot en met het negentiende lid van dit artikel gelden voor verzoeken die ingevolge dit artikel worden gedaan indien de betrokken Partijen niet gebonden zijn door een verdrag aangaande wederzijdse rechtshulp. Indien de Partijen wèl door een dergelijk verdrag zijn gebonden, gelden de overeenkomstige bepalingen van dat verdrag, tenzij de Partijen overeenkomen in plaats daarvan het achtste lid tot en met het negentiende lid van dit artikel toe te passen.   
8.  Partijen wijzen een autoriteit, of, indien nodig, autoriteiten aan, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor en bevoegd zijn tot het uitvoeren van verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp of tot toezending ervan aan de tot uitvoering bevoegde autoriteiten. Zij brengen de hiertoe aangewezen autoriteit of autoriteiten ter kennis aan de Secretaris-Generaal. De toezending van verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp en alle desbetreffende correspondentie geschiedt tussen de daartoe door de partij en aangewezen autoriteiten; deze bepaling geldt onverminderd het recht van een Partij te verlangen dat deze verzoeken en berichten langs diplomatieke weg aan haar worden gericht en, in dringende omstandigheden, indien mogelijk en indien Partijen zulks overeenkomen, via Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization).   
9.  Verzoeken worden schriftelijk gedaan in een voor de aangezochte Partij aanvaardbare taal. Elke Partij brengt de voor haar aanvaardbare taal of talen ter kennis van de Secretaris-Generaal. In dringende omstandigheden, en indien de Partijen zulks overeenkomen, kunnen verzoeken mondeling worden gedaan, maar zij dienen onverwijld schriftelijk te worden bevestigd.   
10.  Een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp omvat: 

a. de identiteit van de autoriteit die het verzoek doet;  

b. het onderwerp en de aard van het onderzoek, de vervolging of de procedure waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft, en de naam en de functies van de autoriteit die dit onderzoek, deze vervolging of deze procedure leidt;  

c. een samenvatting van de ter zake dienende feiten, behalve in geval van verzoeken om het betekenen van gerechtelijke stukken;  

d. een beschrijving van de gewenste hulp en bijzonderheden aangaande specifieke procedures die de verzoekende Partij gevolgd wenst te zien;  

e. indien mogelijk, de identiteit, verblijfplaats en nationaliteit van de betrokken personen;  

f. het doel waarvoor om het bewijsmateriaal, de gegevens of het optreden wordt verzocht.     
11.  De aangezochte Partij kan om aanvullende gegevens verzoeken wanneer dit voor de uitvoering van het verzoek in overeenstemming met haar nationale wetgeving nodig blijkt, of wanneer dit de uitvoering kan vergemakkelijken.   
12.  Een verzoek wordt uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij, voor zover dit niet in strijd is met de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij en indien mogelijk, overeenkomstig de in het verzoek vermelde procedures.   
13.  De verzoekende Partij dient door de aangezochte Partij verstrekte gegevens of bewijsmateriaal niet over te dragen of te gebruiken voor andere dan in het verzoek vermelde onderzoeken, vervolgingen of procedures, zonder voorafgaande toestemming van de aangezochte Partij.   
14.  De verzoekende Partij kan verlangen dat de aangezochte Partij het feit dat het verzoek is gedaan en de strekking van het verzoek vertrouwelijk behandelt, behalve voor zover daarvan moet worden afgeweken teneinde het verzoek uit te voeren. Indien de aangezochte Partij niet kan voldoen aan het vereiste van vertrouwelijkheid, stelt zij de verzoekende Partij hiervan onmiddellijk in kennis.   
15.  Wederzijdse rechtshulp kan worden geweigerd: 

a. indien het verzoek niet in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel wordt gedaan;  

b. indien de aangezochte Partij van mening is dat uitvoering van het verzoek haar soevereiniteit, veiligheid, openbare orde, of andere wezenlijke belangen vermoedelijk zal schaden;  

c. indien het de autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij door haar nationale wetgeving verboden zou zijn de verzochte handeling te verrichten ten aanzien van soortgelijke strafbare feiten, indien deze het onderwerp zouden zijn van onderzoek, vervolging of procedures onder hun eigen rechtsmacht;  

d. indien inwilliging van het verzoek in strijd zou zijn met de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij aangaande wederzijdse rechtshulp.     
16.  Weigeringen tot het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp worden met redenen omkleed.   
17.  Wederzijdse rechtshulp kan door de aangezochte Partij worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat deze een lopend onderzoek, een lopende vervolging of een lopende procedure doorkruist. In dit geval pleegt de aangezochte Partij overleg met de verzoekende Partij om te bepalen of de rechtshulp nog kan worden verleend onder de voorwaarden die de aangezochte Partij nodig acht.   
18.  Een getuige, deskundige of andere persoon die zich bereid verklaart te getuigen in een proces of te helpen bij een onderzoek, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Partij, wordt niet vervolgd, in hechtenis genomen, gestraft of onderworpen aan andere beperkingen van zijn persoonlijke vrijheid op dat grondgebied vanwege handelingen, nalatigheden of veroordelingen voorafgaande aan zijn vertrek van het grondgebied van de aangezochte Partij. Deze vrijgeleide houdt op wanneer de getuige, deskundige of andere persoon gedurende een tijdvak van vijftien achtereenvolgende dagen, of gedurende een door de Partijen overeengekomen tijdvak, vanaf de datum waarop hem officieel is meegedeeld dat zijn aanwezigheid door de rechterlijke autoriteiten niet langer is vereist, de mogelijkheid heeft gehad te vertrekken, maar desondanks vrijwillig op het grondgebied is gebleven, of het heeft verlaten en uit eigen vrije wil is teruggekeerd.   
19.  De gewone kosten van uitvoering van een verzoek komen ten laste van de aangezochte Partij, tenzij door de betrokken Partijen anders is overeengekomen. Indien aanzienlijke of buitengewone onkosten worden of zullen moeten worden gemaakt om aan het verzoek te voldoen, plegen de Partijen overleg om de voorwaarden te bepalen waarop het verzoek wordt uitgevoerd alsmede de wijze waarop de kosten zullen worden gedragen.   
20.  De Partijen overwegen, indien noodzakelijk, de mogelijkheid bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten te sluiten of regelingen te treffen die de doeleinden van de bepalingen in dit artikel dienen, aan deze bepalingen praktische uitvoering geven of de werking ervan verbeteren.   

### Artikel  8  

####Overdracht van strafvervolging

De Partijen overwegen de mogelijkheid de strafvervolging aan elkaar over te dragen van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten in gevallen waarin deze overdracht in het belang van een goede rechtsbedeling wordt geacht.  

### Artikel  9  

####Andere vormen van samenwerking en opleiding

1.  De Partijen werken nauw met elkaar samen, op een wijze die verenigbaar is met onderscheiden nationale rechts- en bestuursstelsels, teneinde de doeltreffendheid te vergroten van de opsporing en wetshandhaving met het oog op de bestrijding van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten. In het bijzonder zullen zij, op grond van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen: 

a. verbindingskanalen tussen hun bevoegde instanties en diensten tot stand brengen en onderhouden om de veilige en snelle uitwisseling van gegevens aangaande alle aspecten van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten te vergemakkelijken, waaronder begrepen verbanden met andere misdadige praktijken, indien de betrokken Partijen dit passend achten;  

b. met elkaar samenwerken in het uitvoeren van onderzoeken aangaande in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten die een internationaal karakter hebben, wat betreft: 

(i) de identiteit, verblijfplaats en activiteiten van personen die ervan worden verdacht te zijn betrokken bij in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten;  

(ii) het verkeer van uit het begaan van dergelijke strafbare feiten verworven opbrengsten en voorwerpen;  

(iii) het verkeer van verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen, stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II van dit Verdrag en hulpmiddelen die worden of zijn bestemd om te worden gebruikt bij het begaan van dergelijke strafbare feiten;    

c. in passende gevallen en indien dit niet in strijd is met het nationale recht, gezamenlijke teams vormen voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit lid, met inachtneming van de noodzaak van het beschermen van de veiligheid van personen en operaties. De functionarissen van een Partij die deel uitmaken van een dergelijk team moeten zich houden aan de aanwijzingen van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de operatie plaats vindt; in al deze gevallen dragen de betrokken Partijen er zorg voor dat de soevereiniteit van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de operatie plaats vindt, ten volle wordt geëerbiedigd;  

d. wanneer van toepassing, de benodigde hoeveelheden stoffen verstrekken voor analyse of opsporingsonderzoek;  

e. doeltreffende coördinatie tussen hun bevoegde instanties en diensten vergemakkelijken, en de uitwisseling bevorderen van personeel en andere deskundigen, waaronder begrepen de detachering van verbindingsfunctionarissen.     
2.  Elke Partij zal, voor zover nodig, gerichte opleidingsprogramma's opzetten, ontwikkelen of verbeteren voor haar wetshandhavend en ander personeel, waaronder begrepen douanebeambten, dat belast is met de bestrijding van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten. In deze programma's dienen in het bijzonder de volgende onderwerpen aan de orde te komen: 

a. methoden die worden gebruikt bij de opsporing en bestrijding van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten;  

b. routes en methoden die worden gebruikt door personen die ervan worden verdacht te zijn betrokken bij in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten, in het bijzonder in Staten van doorvoer, en passende maatregelen hiertegen;  

c. toezicht op de in- en uitvoer van verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en in Tabel I en Tabel II genoemde stoffen;  

d. opsporing van en toezicht op het verkeer van opbrengsten en voorwerpen verworven uit in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten, en verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en in Tabel I en Tabel II genoemde stoffen, en hulpmiddelen die worden of zijn bestemd om te worden gebruikt bij het begaan van deze feiten;  

e. methoden die worden gebruikt voor het overdragen, verbergen of verhullen van deze opbrengsten, goederen en hulpmiddelen;  

f. het verzamelen van bewijs;  

g. methoden voor het houden van toezicht in vrijhandelszones en vrijhavens;  

h. moderne technieken voor opsporing en wetshandhaving.     
3.  De Partijen helpen elkaar bij het ontwerpen en uitvoeren van onderzoeks- en opleidingsprogramma's die tot doel hebben hun deskundigheid op de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde gebieden te delen, en zij maken hiervoor tevens gebruik, wanneer dat passend wordt geacht, van regionale en internationale conferenties en studiebijeenkomsten voor het bevorderen van de samenwerking en het aanmoedigen van de bespreking van problemen van wederzijds belang, waaronder begrepen de bijzondere problemen en behoeften van Staten van doorvoer.   

### Artikel  10  

####Internationale samenwerking en hulp aan Staten van doorvoer

1.  De Partijen werken samen, rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van bevoegde internationale of regionale organisaties, om waar mogelijk hulp en steun te verlenen aan Staten van doorvoer, en in het bijzonder aan ontwikkelingslanden die behoefte hebben aan dergelijke hulp en steun, door middel van programma's voor technische samenwerking om de illegale invoer en doorvoer te beletten, of andere verwante activiteiten.   
2.  De Partijen kunnen zich, rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van bevoegde internationale of regionale organisaties, verbinden tot het verlenen van financiële hulp aan Staten van doorvoer teneinde de infrastructuur die nodig is voor doeltreffende bestrijding en voorkoming van sluikhandel uit te breiden en te versterken.   
3.  De Partijen kunnen bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten sluiten of regelingen treffen om de doeltreffendheid van de internationale samenwerking ingevolge dit artikel te vergroten en kunnen in dit verband financiële regelingen in overweging nemen.   

### Artikel  11  

####Gecontroleerde aflevering

1.  Indien geoorloofd volgens de grondbeginselen van hun onderscheiden nationale rechtsstelsels nemen de Partijen de nodige maatregelen om, binnen hun mogelijkheden, gepast gebruik van gecontroleerde aflevering op internationaal niveau mogelijk te maken, op grond van overeenkomsten of regelingen die wederzijds zijn overeengekomen, teneinde personen te identificeren die zijn betrokken bij in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten, en gerechtelijke stappen tegen hen te ondernemen.   
2.  Beslissingen om van gecontroleerde aflevering gebruik te maken, worden van geval tot geval genomen, waarbij zo nodig rekening wordt gehouden met financiële regelingen en afspraken ten aanzien van de uitoefening van rechtsmacht door de betrokken Partijen.   
3.  Illegale zendingen waarvoor gecontroleerde aflevering is over eengekomen, kunnen, wanneer de betrokken Partijen hiermee instemmen, worden onderschept en vervolgens worden doorgelaten, waarbij de verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen onaangeroerd blijven dan wel geheel of gedeeltelijk worden verwijderd of vervangen.   

### Artikel  12  

####Stoffen die vaak worden gebruikt bij de illegale vervaardiging van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen

1.  De Partijen dienen de door hen passend geachte maatregelen te treffen om te voorkomen dat de in Tabel I en Tabel II genoemde stoffen worden misbruikt voor de illegale vervaardiging van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen, en werken hiertoe met elkaar samen.   
2.  Indien een Partij of het Comité over gegevens beschikt die naar haar of zijn mening opneming van een stof in Tabel I of Tabel II noodzakelijk maken, doet die Partij of het Comité daarvan mededeling aan de Secretaris-Generaal, en verschaft hem de inlichtingen die deze mededeling staven. De in het tweede tot en met het zevende lid van dit artikel beschreven procedure geldt ook wanneer een Partij of het Comité over gegevens beschikt die het afvoeren van een stof van Tabel I of Tabel II, of het overbrengen van een stof van de ene Tabel naar de andere rechtvaardigen.   
3.  De Secretaris-Generaal doet deze mededeling en alle inlichtingen die hij nuttig acht, toekomen aan de Partijen, aan de Commissie en, indien de mededeling wordt gedaan door een Partij, aan het Comité. De Partijen doen hun commentaar op de mededeling toekomen aan de Secretaris-Generaal, tezamen met alle aanvullende gegevens die het Comité kunnen helpen een oordeel te vormen, en de Commissie kunnen helpen tot een beslissing te komen.   
4.  Indien het Comité, rekening houdend met de mate, het belang en de verscheidenheid van de vormen van legaal gebruik van de stof, alsmede de mogelijkheid en het gemak van het gebruik van vervangende stoffen zowel voor legale doeleinden als voor de illegale vervaardiging van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, tot de slotsom komt: 

a. dat de stof veelvuldig wordt gebruikt bij de illegale vervaardiging van een verdovend middel of een psychotrope stof;  

b. dat de omvang en mate van de illegale vervaardiging van een verdovend middel of een psychotrope stof zodanig ernstige moeilijkheden op het gebied van de volksgezondheid of van maatschappelijke aard scheppen, dat internationaal ingrijpen gerechtvaardigd is, zendt het het Comité aan de Commissie een beoordeling van de stof, waarbij wordt aangegeven wat de waarschijnlijke gevolgen zijn van toevoeging van de stof aan Tabel I of Tabel II op zowel legaal gebruik als op illegale vervaardiging, en doet het Comité aanbevelingen voor maatregelen van toezicht die in het licht van bovenbedoelde beoordeling passend zouden zijn.     
5.  De Commissie kan, rekening houdend met de commentaren van Partijen en de commentaren en aanbevelingen van het Comité, wiens beoordeling doorslaggevend zal zijn in wetenschappelijke aangelegenheden, en in aanmerking nemend eventuele andere ter zake dienende factoren, met een meerderheid van twee derde van haar leden besluiten een stof in Tabel I of Tabel II op te nemen.   
6.  Elk besluit dat de Commissie ingevolge dit artikel neemt, wordt door de Secretaris-Generaal ter kennis gebracht van alle Staten en andere organisaties die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag of gerechtigd zijn Partij te worden, en aan het Comité. Een dergelijk besluit treedt ten aanzien van elke Partij in werking honderdtachtig dagen na datum van een dergelijke kennisgeving.   
7.  

a. De besluiten die de Commissie ingevolge dit artikel neemt, worden aan de Raad voorgelegd voor een hernieuwd onderzoek, indien een Partij daarom verzoekt binnen honderdtachtig dagen nadat kennisgeving van het besluit is gedaan. Het verzoek dient te zijn gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal en dient te zijn vergezeld van alle terzakedoende gegevens waarmede het verzoek wordt gemotiveerd.  

b. De Secretaris-Generaal zendt afschriften van het verzoek en de ter zake dienende gegevens aan de Commissie, aan het Comité en aan alle Partijen, en verzoekt hun binnen negentig dagen hun commentaar in te dienen. Alle ontvangen commentaren worden ter overweging voorgelegd aan de Raad.  

c. De Raad kan het besluit van de Commissie bevestigen of ongedaan maken. Kennisgeving van het besluit van de Raad wordt gezonden aan alle Staten en andere gebieden en organisaties die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag of gerechtigd zijn Partij te worden, aan de Commissie en aan het Comité.     
8.  

a. Onverminderd de algemene gelding van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel vervatte bepalingen en de bepalingen van het Verdrag van 1961, het Verdrag van 1961 zoals gewijzigd en het Verdrag van 1971, nemen de Partijen de door hen passend geachte maatregelen voor het houden van toezicht binnen hun grondgebied op de vervaardiging en distributie van de stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II.  

b. Hiertoe kunnen de Partijen: 

(i) toezicht houden op alle personen en ondernemingen die zich bezighouden met de vervaardiging en distributie van deze stoffen;  

(ii) de inrichtingen en gebouwen waarin deze vervaardiging of distributie kan plaatsvinden onderwerpen aan een vergunningenstelsel;  

(iii) voorschrijven dat vergunninghouders zich in het bezit stellen van een machtiging voor het verrichten van de eerder genoemde handelingen;  

(iv) voorkomen dat fabrikanten en distributeurs grotere hoeveelheden van deze stoffen in voorraad hebben dan vereist is voor de normale bedrijfsvoering en de bestaande marktsituatie.       
9.  Elke Partij neemt ten aanzien van de stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II de volgende maatregelen: 

a. stelt in en houdt in stand een systeem van toezicht op de internationale handel in stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II teneinde de ontdekking van verdachte transacties te vergemakkelijken. Deze toezichtsystemen worden toegepast in nauwe samenwerking met fabrikanten, importeurs, exporteurs en groot- en kleinhandelaren, die de bevoegde autoriteiten inlichten over verdachte orders en transacties;  

b. voorziet in de inbeslagneming van elke in Tabel I of Tabel II genoemde stof indien er voldoende bewijs is dat deze is bestemd om te worden gebruikt bij de clandestiene vervaardiging van een verdovend middel of een psychotrope stof;  

c. stelt zo spoedig mogelijk de bevoegde autoriteiten en diensten van de betrokken Partijen op de hoogte indien er reden is om te veronderstellen dat de in-, uit- of doorvoer van een in Tabel I of Tabel II genoemde stof de clandestiene vervaardiging van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen tot doel heeft, en met name het verstrekken van gegevens over de wijze van betalen en alle andere belangrijke elementen die tot die veronderstelling hebben geleid;  

d. schrijft voor dat zendingen voor in- en uitvoer behoorlijk van etiketten en documenten zijn voorzien. Op handelsdocumenten zoals facturen, vrachtbrieven, douanepapieren en vervoersdocumenten worden vermeld de namen van de stoffen die worden in- of uitgevoerd, zoals gegeven in Tabel I of Tabel II, de hoeveelheid die wordt in- of uitgevoerd, en naam en adres van de exporteur, van de importeur en, indien beschikbaar, van de geadresseerde;  

e. verzekert dat de in letter (d) van dit artikel bedoelde documenten gedurende een tijdvak van ten minste twee jaar worden bewaard en beschikbaar kunnen worden gesteld voor inspectie door de bevoegde autoriteiten.     
10.  

a. In aanvulling op de bepalingen van het negende lid, en op verzoek van de belanghebbende Partij aan de Secretaris-Generaal, draagt elke Partij uit het grondgebied waarvan een in Tabel I genoemde stof zal worden uitgevoerd er zorg voor dat, voorafgaand aan deze uitvoer, de volgende gegevens door haar bevoegde autoriteiten worden verstrekt aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van het land waar de stof zal worden ingevoerd: 

(i) de naam en het adres van de exporteur, van de importeur en, indien beschikbaar, van de geadresseerde;  

(ii) de naam van de stof in Tabel I;  

(iii) de hoeveelheid van de uit te voeren stof;  

(iv) de verwachte plaats van invoer en de verwachte datum van verzending;  

(v) alle andere inlichtingen waarover wederzijds overeenstemming tussen de Partijen is bereikt.    

b. Een Partij kan strengere maatregelen van toezicht nemen dan die voorzien in dit lid indien dergelijke maatregelen naar haar oordeel gewenst of noodzakelijk zijn.     
11.  Wanneer een Partij aan een andere Partij inlichtingen verstrekt in overeenstemming met het negende en tiende lid van dit artikel kan de Partij die deze inlichtingen verstrekt verlangen dat de Partij die deze ontvangt alle handels-, bedrijfs- of beroepsgeheimen of fabrieks- of handelswerkwijzen als vertrouwelijk behandelt.   
12.  Elke Partij verstrekt het Comité jaarlijks, in de vorm en op de wijze die het Comité vaststelt en op formulieren die het Comité verstrekt, inlichtingen over: 

a. de in beslag genomen hoeveelheden van stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II en, indien bekend, hun herkomst;  

b. stoffen die niet in Tabel I of Tabel II zijn opgenomen, waarvan is vastgesteld dat zij zijn gebruikt bij de clandestiene vervaardiging van verdovende middelen of psychotrope stoffen, en die door de Partij van voldoende betekenis worden geacht om onder de aandacht van het Comité te worden gebracht;  

c. methoden van ontduiking en illegale vervaardiging.     
14.  De bepalingen van dit artikel gelden niet voor farmaceutische preparaten, noch voor andere preparaten die stoffen in Tabel I of Tabel II bevatten en die op zodanige wijze zijn samengesteld dat deze stoffen niet gemakkelijk kunnen worden gebruikt of met eenvoudig toe te passen middelen kunnen worden teruggewonnen.   

### Artikel  13  

####Materialen en apparatuur

De Partijen nemen de door hen passend geachte maatregelen om de handel in en het misbruik van materialen en apparatuur voor de illegale produktie of vervaardiging van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen te voorkomen en werken hiertoe samen.  

### Artikel  14  

####Maatregelen om de clandestiene teelt van planten die verdovende middelen bevatten, uit te roeien, en de illegale vraag naar verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen uit te bannen

1.  Maatregelen die door Partijen ingevolge dit Verdrag worden genomen, dienen niet minder streng te zijn dan de bepalingen van het Verdrag van 1961, het Verdrag van 1961 zoals gewijzigd en het Verdrag van 1971 met betrekking tot het uitroeien van de illegale teelt van planten die verdovende en psychotrope stoffen bevatten en het uitbannen van de illegale vraag naar verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen.   
2.  Elke Partij neemt passende maatregelen om op haar grondgebied de illegale teelt van planten die verdovende of psychotrope stoffen bevatten, zoals opium, cocaplanten en cannabisplanten, te voorkomen, en om deze planten uit te roeien, indien zij daar illegaal worden geteelt. Bij het nemen van deze maatregelen worden de fundamentele rechten van de mens geëerbiedigd en wordt naar behoren rekening gehouden met van oudsher toegestane vormen van gebruik, wanneer er historisch bewijs van dergelijk gebruik is, alsmede met de bescherming van het milieu.   
3.  

a. De Partijen kunnen samenwerken om de doeltreffendheid van de inspanningen tot uitroeiing te vergroten. Deze samenwerking kan in passende gevallen onder andere een ondersteuning inhouden van de geïntegreerde plattelandsontwikkeling, leidend tot economisch levensvatbare alternatieven voor de illegale teelt. Factoren als toegang tot markten, de beschikbaarheid van middelen en de heersende sociaal-economische omstandigheden dienen in aanmerking te worden genomen voordat dergelijke programma's voor plattelandsontwikkeling worden uitgevoerd. De Partijen kunnen andere passende vormen van samenwerking overeenkomen.  

b. De Partijen vergemakkelijken tevens het uitwisselen van wetenschappelijke en technische gegevens en het verrichten van onderzoek aangaande uitroeiing van illegale teelt.  

c. In alle gevallen waar zij gezamenlijke grenzen hebben, streven de Partijen naar samenwerking in uitroeiingsprogramma's in hun onderscheiden gebieden langs deze grenzen.     
4.  De Partijen nemen passende maatregelen gericht op het uitbannen of het verminderen van de clandestiene vraag naar verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, teneinde het menselijke leed te verminderen en de financiële drijfveren voor de sluikhandel weg te nemen. Deze maatregelen kunnen onder andere worden gebaseerd op de aanbevelingen van de Verenigde Naties, van gespecialiseerde organisaties van de Verenigde Naties zoals de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie, en andere bevoegde internationale organisaties, en op het Allesomvattende Interdisciplinaire Plan dat werd aangenomen door de Internationale conferentie inzake misbruik van en sluikhandel in verdovende middelen die werd gehouden in 1987, voor zover dit betrekking heeft op gouvernementele en niet-gouvernementele organisaties en particuliere inspanningen op het gebied van voorkoming, behandeling en wederaanpassing. De Partijen kunnen bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen aangaan gericht op het uitbannen of verminderen van de clandestiene vraag naar verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen.   
5.  De Partijen kunnen ook de nodige maatregelen nemen voor snelle vernietiging of legaal gebruik van verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en stoffen vermeld in Tabel I en Tabel II die zijn inbeslaggenomen of zijn geconfisqueerd, alsmede voor de toelaatbaarheid als bewijsmiddel van daartoe naar behoren gemerkte benodigde hoeveelheden van deze stoffen.   

### Artikel  15  

####Beroepsvervoerder

1.  De Partijen nemen passende maatregelen om er zorg voor te dragen dat vervoermiddelen die door beroepsvervoerders worden geëxploiteerd, niet worden gebruikt bij het begaan van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten; deze maatregelen kunnen bijzondere regelingen met beroepsvervoerders omvatten.   
2.  Elke Partij verlangt dat beroepsvervoerders redelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen nemen om te voorkomen dat hun vervoermiddelen worden gebruikt voor het begaan van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten. Deze voorzorgsmaatregelen kunnen omvatten: 

a. indien de hoofdvestiging van een beroepsvervoerder binnen het grondgebied van de Partij is gelegen: 

(i) het opleiden van personeel om verdachte zendingen of personen te identificeren;  

(ii) het bevorderen van de integriteit van het personeel;    

b. indien een beroepsvervoerder binnen het grondgebied van de Partij werkzaam is: 

(i) het vooraf indienen van vrachtbrieven, indien mogelijk;  

(ii) het gebruiken van moeilijk te vervalsen, individueel te verifieren zegels op verpakkingen;  

(iii) het zo vroeg mogelijk melden aan de desbetreffende autoriteiten van alle verdachte omstandigheden die verband kunnen houden met het begaan van in overeenstemming met artikel 3, eerste lid, strafbaar gestelde feiten.       
3.  Elke Partij streeft ernaar te bewerkstelligen dat beroepsvervoerders en de desbetreffende autoriteiten samenwerken op punten van binnenkomst en vertrek en in andere gebieden die onder douanetoezicht staan, teneinde ongeoorloofde toegang tot vervoermiddelen en lading te voorkomen en passende veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen.   

### Artikel  16  

####Handelsdocumenten en het etiketteren van zendingen voor uitvoer

1.  Elke Partij verlangt dat zendingen van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen voor wettige uitvoer behoorlijk zijn voorzien van documenten. Naast de vereisten voor documentatie krachtens artikel 31 van het Verdrag van 1961, artikel 31 van het Verdrag van 1961 zoals gewijzigd en artikel 12 van het Verdrag van 1971 dienen op handelsdocumenten zoals facturen, vrachtbrieven, douanepapieren en vervoersdocumenten te zijn vermeld de namen van de verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen die worden uitgevoerd zoals gegeven in de onderscheiden Lijsten van het Verdrag van 1961, het Verdrag van 1961 zoals gewijzigd en het Verdrag van 1971, de hoeveelheid die wordt uitgevoerd, alsmede de naam en het adres van de exporteur, van de importeur en, indien beschikbaar, van de geadresseerde.   
2.  Elke Partij verlangt dat zendingen van verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen die worden uitgevoerd niet op onjuiste wijze worden geëtiketteerd.   

### Artikel  17  

####Sluikhandel over zee

1.  De Partijen werken zoveel mogelijk samen om, in overeenstemming met het internationale zeerecht, de sluikhandel over zee tegen te gaan.   
2.  Een Partij die redelijke gronden heeft om te vermoeden dat een vaartuig dat haar vlag voert dan wel geen vlag voert of geen nationaliteitskentekens toont, bij sluikhandel is betrokken, kan de hulp inroepen van andere Partijen om het gebruik van het vaartuig voor dit doel tegen te gaan. De Partijen waarvan aldus de hulp wordt ingeroepen, verlenen deze hulp met de middelen waarover zij beschikken.   
3.  Een Partij die redelijke gronden heeft om te vermoeden dat een vaartuig dat in overeenstemming met het internationale recht de vrijheid van scheepvaart uitoefent en dat de vlag voert of de nationaliteitskentekens toont van een andere Partij, is betrokken bij sluikhandel, kan dit melden aan de vlaggestaat, kan verzoeken om bevestiging van de registratie en kan, indien de nationaliteit wordt bevestigd, de vlaggestaat verzoeken haar te machtigen ten aanzien van dat vaartuig passende maatregelen te nemen.   
4.  In overeenstemming met het derde lid of in overeenstemming met verdragen die tussen hen van kracht zijn of in overeenstemming met anderszins tussen die Partijen bestaande overeenkomsten of regelingen kan de vlaggestaat de verzoekende Staat machtigen om, onder andere: 

a. het vaartuig aan te houden;  

b. het vaartuig te doorzoeken;  

c. indien bewijs van betrokkenheid bij sluikhandel wordt gevonden, passende maatregelen te nemen ten aanzien van het vaartuig, de personen en de lading aan boord.     
5.  Wanneer ingevolge dit artikel maatregelen worden genomen, houden de betrokken Partijen er naar behoren rekening mede dat de veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee en van het vaartuig en de lading niet in gevaar mogen worden gebracht en dat de handelsbelangen en rechtsbelangen van de vlaggestaat of van andere belanghebbende Staten niet mogen worden geschaad.   
6.  De vlaggestaat kan, voor zover dit verenigbaar is met zijn verplichtingen in het eerste lid van dit artikel, zijn machtiging afhankelijk stellen van met de verzoekende Partij overeen te komen voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden betreffende aansprakelijkheid.   
7.  Voor de toepassing van het derde en vierde lid van dit artikel geeft een Partij onverwijld antwoord op ieder verzoek van een andere Partij om vast te stellen of een vaartuig dat haar vlag voert daartoe gerechtigd is, en op verzoeken om machtiging die worden ingediend ingevolge het derde lid. Op het tijdstip dat zij Partij bij dit Verdrag wordt, wijst elke Partij een autoriteit, of zonodig autoriteiten, aan voor het ontvangen en beantwoorden van dergelijke verzoeken. Deze aanwijzing wordt door tussenkomst van de Secretaris-Generaal aan alle andere Partijen meegedeeld binnen een maand nadat zij is geschied.   
8.  Een Partij die een van de maatregelen heeft genomen voorzien in dit artikel, stelt de betrokken vlaggestaat onmiddellijk op de hoogte van de resultaten van dat optreden.   
9.  De Partijen overwegen bilaterale of regionale overeenkomsten of regelingen aan te gaan om de bepalingen van dit artikel uit te voeren of de doeltreffendheid ervan te vergroten.   
10.  Maatregelen bedoeld in het vierde lid van dit artikel worden slechts tenuitvoergelegd door oorlogsschepen, militaire luchtvaartuigen, of andere vaartuigen of luchtvaartuigen die duidelijke merktekens tonen waaruit blijkt dat zij in dienst zijn van de staat en dat zij tot die maatregelen gemachtigd zijn.   
11.  Bij ieder optreden in overeenstemming met dit artikel wordt, in overeenstemming met het internationale zeerecht, er naar behoren rekening mee gehouden dat geen inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de rechten en verplichtingen en de uitoefening van de rechtsmacht van kuststaten en dat geen aantasting plaatsvindt van deze rechten, verplichtingen of rechtsmacht.   

### Artikel  18  

####Vrijhandelszones en vrijhavens

1.  De Partijen passen ter bestrijding van de sluikhandel in verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en stoffen in Tabel I en II in vrijhandelszones en in vrijhavens maatregelen toe die niet minder streng zijn dan de maatregelen die zij in andere delen van hun grondgebied toepassen.   
2.  De Partijen streven ernaar: 

a. toezicht te houden op het verkeer van goederen en personen in vrijhandelszones en vrijhavens en verlenen hiertoe de bevoegde autoriteiten bevoegdheid om inspectie uit te voeren van ladingen en inkomende en uitgaande vaartuigen, waaronder begrepen pleziervaartuigen en vissersvaartuigen, luchtvaartuigen en voertuigen, en om in passende gevallen bemanningsleden, passagiers en hun bagage aan een onderzoek te onderwerpen;  

b. een systeem in te stellen en ten uitvoer te leggen voor het opsporen van zendingen die vrijhandelszones en vrijhavens in- of uitgaan en die ervan verdacht worden verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en stoffen te bevatten als bedoeld in Tabel I en Tabel II;  

c. bewakingssystemen in te stellen en ten uitvoer te leggen in havengebieden, rond dokken en op luchthavens en grenscontroleposten in vrijhandelszones en vrijhavens.     

### Artikel  19  

####Het gebruik van de post

1.  In overeenstemming met hun verplichtingen krachtens de verdragen van de Wereld Post Unie, en in overeenstemming met de grondbeginselen van hun nationale rechtsstelsels nemen de Partijen maatregelen ter bestrijding van het gebruik van de post voor sluikhandel, en werken hiertoe met elkaar samen.   
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen omvatten in het bijzonder: 

a. gecoördineerd optreden ter voorkoming en het tegengaan van het gebruik van de post voor sluikhandel;  

b. het invoeren en in stand houden door tot opsporing en rechtshandhaving bevoegd personeel van methoden van onderzoek en toezicht die erop gericht zijn illegale zendingen van verdovende middelen, psychotrope stoffen en stoffen in Tabel I en Tabel II in de post op te sporen;  

c. wetgevende maatregelen om het gebruik mogelijk te maken van passende middelen voor het vergaren van bewijs ten behoeve van de vervolging.
