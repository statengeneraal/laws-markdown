In the case of offences established in accordance with this Convention, each State Party shall take appropriate measures, in accordance with its domestic law and with due regard to the rights of the defence, to seek to ensure that conditions imposed in connection with decisions on release pending trial or appeal take into consideration the need to ensure the presence of the defendant at subsequent criminal proceedings.   
5.  Each State Party shall take into account the gravity of the offences concerned when considering the eventuality of early release or parole of persons convicted of such offences.   
6.  Each State Party, to the extent consistent with the fundamental principles of its legal system, shall consider establishing procedures through which a public official accused of an offence established in accordance with this Convention may, where appropriate, be removed, suspended or reassigned by the appropriate authority, bearing in mind respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence.   
7.  Where warranted by the gravity of the offence, each State Party, to the extent consistent with the fundamental principles of its legal system, shall consider establishing procedures for the disqualification, by court order or any other appropriate means, for a period of time determined by its domestic law, of persons convicted of offences established in accordance with this Convention from: 

a) Holding public office; and  

b) Holding office in an enterprise owned in whole or in part by the State.     
8.  Paragraph 1 of this article shall be without prejudice to the exercise of disciplinary powers by the competent authorities against civil servants.   
9.  Nothing contained in this Convention shall affect the principle that the description of the offences established in accordance with this Convention and of the applicable legal defences or other legal principles controlling the lawfulness of conduct is reserved to the domestic law of a State Party and that such offences shall be prosecuted and punished in accordance with that law.   
10.  States Parties shall endeavour to promote the reintegration into society of persons convicted of offences established in accordance with this Convention.

Income or other benefits derived from such proceeds of crime, from property into which such proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or from property with which such proceeds of crime have been intermingled shall also be liable to the measures referred to in this article, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds of crime.   
7.  For the purpose of this article and article 55 of this Convention, each State Party shall empower its courts or other competent authorities to order that bank, financial or commercial records be made available or seized. A State Party shall not decline to act under the provisions of this paragraph on the ground of bank secrecy.   
8.  States Parties may consider the possibility of requiring that an offender demonstrate the lawful origin of such alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation, to the extent that such a requirement is consistent with the fundamental principles of their domestic law and with the nature of judicial and other proceedings.   
9.  The provisions of this article shall not be so construed as to prejudice the rights of bona fide third parties.   
10.  Nothing contained in this article shall affect the principle that the measures to which it refers shall be defined and implemented in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the domestic law of a State Party.   

### Article  32

1.  Each State Party shall take appropriate measures in accordance with its domestic legal system and within its means to provide effective protection from potential retaliation or intimidation for witnesses and experts who give testimony concerning offences established in accordance with this Convention and, as appropriate, for their relatives and other persons close to them.

Each State Party may adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to take into consideration, under such terms as and for the purpose that it deems appropriate, any previous conviction in another State of an alleged offender for the purpose of using such information in criminal proceedings relating to an offence established in accordance with this Convention.  

### Article  42  

####Jurisdiction

1.  Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences established in accordance with this Convention when: 

a) The offence is committed in the territory of that State Party; or

6.  Without prejudice to norms of general international law, this Convention shall not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a State Party in accordance with its domestic law.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

### Article  43  

####International cooperation

1.  States Parties shall cooperate in criminal matters in accordance with articles 44 to 50 of this Convention. Where appropriate and consistent with their domestic legal system, States Parties shall consider assisting each other in investigations of and proceedings in civil and administrative matters relating to corruption.   
2.  In matters of international cooperation, whenever dual criminality is considered a requirement, it shall be deemed fulfilled irrespective of whether the laws of the requested State Party place the offence within the same category of offence or denominate the offence by the same terminology as the requesting State Party, if the conduct underlying the offence for which assistance is sought is a criminal offence under the laws of both States Parties.   

### Article  44  

####Extradition

1.  This article shall apply to the offences established in accordance with this Convention where the person who is the subject of the request for extradition is present in the territory of the requested State Party, provided that the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable under the domestic law of both the requesting State Party and the requested State Party.   
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a State Party whose law so permits may grant the extradition of a person for any of the offences covered by this Convention that are not punishable under its own domestic law.   
3.  If the request for extradition includes several separate offences, at least one of which is extraditable under this article and some of which are not extraditable by reason of their period of imprisonment but are related to offences established in accordance with this Convention, the requested State Party may apply this article also in respect of those offences.   
4.  Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them. A State Party whose law so permits, in case it uses this Convention as the basis for extradition, shall not consider any of the offences established in accordance with this Convention to be a political offence.   
5.  If a State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention the legal basis for extradition in respect of any offence to which this article applies.   
6.  A State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall: 

a) At the time of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of or accession to this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether it will take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition with other States Parties to this Convention; and  

b) If it does not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition, seek, where appropriate, to conclude treaties on extradition with other States Parties to this Convention in order to implement this article.     
7.  States Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize offences to which this article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.   
8.  Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, conditions in relation to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition.   
9.  States Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating thereto in respect of any offence to which this article applies.   
10.  Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested State Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent and at the request of the requesting State Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his or her presence at extradition proceedings.   
11.  A State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does not extradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article applies solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at the request of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the domestic law of that State Party. The States Parties concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution.   
12.  Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nat ionals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought and that State Party and the State Par ty seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem appropriate, such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 11 of this article.   
13.  If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because the person sought is a national of the requested State Party, the requested State Party shall, if its domestic law so permits and in conformity with the requirements of such law, upon application of the requesting State Party, consider the enforcement of the sentence imposed under the domestic law of the requesting State Party or the remainder thereof.   
14.  Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with any of the offences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the domestic law of the State Party in the territory of which that person is present.   
15.  Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any one of these reasons.   
16.  States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.   
17.  Before refusing extradition, the requested State Party shall, where appropriate, consult with the requesting State Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present its opinions and to provide information relevant to its allegation.   
18.  States Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements or arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition.   

### Article  45  

####Transfer of sentenced persons

States Parties may consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements on the transfer to their territory of persons sentenced to imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty for offences established in accordance with this Convention in order that they may complete their sentences there.  

### Article  46  

####Mutual legal assistance

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by this Convention.   
2.  Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible under relevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the requested State Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences for which a legal person may be held liable in accordance with article 26 of this Convention in the requesting State Party.   
3.  Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article may be requested for any of the following purposes: 

a) Taking evidence or statements from persons;  

b) Effecting service of judicial documents;  

c) Executing searches and seizures, and freezing;

g) Identifying or tracing proceeds of crime, property, instrumentalities or other things for evidentiary purposes;  

h) Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting State Party;  

i) Any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law of the requested State Party;  

j) Identifying, freezing and tracing proceeds of crime in accordance with the provisions of chapter V of this Convention;  

k) The recovery of assets, in accordance with the provisions of chapter V of this Convention.     
4.  Without prejudice to domestic law, the competent authorities of a State Party may, without prior request, transmit information relating to criminal matters to a competent authority in another State Party where they believe that such information could assist the authority in undertaking or successfully concluding inquiries and criminal proceedings or could result in a request formulated by the latter State Party pursuant to this Convention.   
5.  The transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent authorities providing the information. The competent authorities receiving the information shall comply with a request that said information remain confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its use. However, this shall not prevent the receiving State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information that is exculpatory to an accused person. In such a case, the receiving State Party shall notify the transmitting State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the transmitting State Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the receiving State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay.   
6.  The provisions of this article shall not affect the obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance.   
7.  Paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant to this article if the States Parties in question are not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If those States Parties are bound by such a treaty, the corresponding provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the States Parties agree to apply paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article in lieu thereof. States Parties are strongly encouraged to apply those paragraphs if they facilitate cooperation.   
8.  States Parties shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of bank secrecy.   
9. 
a) A requested State Party, in responding to a request for assistance pursuant to this article in the absence of dual criminality, shall take into account the purposes of this Convention, as set forth in article 1;  

b) States Parties may decline to render assistance pursuant to this article on the ground of absence of dual criminality. However, a requested State Party shall, where consistent with the basic concepts of its legal system, render assistance that does not involve coercive action. Such assistance may be refused when requests involve matters of a de minimis nature or matters for which the cooperation or assistance sought is available under other provisions of this Convention;  

c) Each State Party may consider adopting such measures as may be necessary to enable it to provide a wider scope of assistance pursuant to this article in the absence of dual criminality.     
10.  A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of identification, testimony or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings in relation to offences covered by this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met: 

a) The person freely gives his or her informed consent;  

b) The competent authorities of both States Parties agree, subject to such conditions as those States Parties may deem appropriate.     
11.  For the purposes of paragraph 10 of this article: 

a) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall have the authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody, unless otherwise requested or authorized by the State Party from which the person was transferred;  

b) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State Party from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand, or as otherwise agreed, by the competent authorities of both States Parties;  

c) The State Party to which the person is transferred shall not require the State Party from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings for the return of the person;  

d) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State from which he or she was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State Party to which he or she was transferred.     
12.  Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 11 of this article so agrees, that person, whatever his or her nationality, shall not be prosecuted, detained, punished or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts, omissions or convictions prior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from which he or she was transferred.   
13.  Each State Party shall designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility and power to receive requests for mutual legal assistance and either to execute them or to transmit them to the competent authorities for execution. Where a State Party has a special region or territory with a separate system of mutual legal assistance, it may designate a distinct central authority that shall have the same function for that region or territory. Central authorities shall ensure the speedy and proper execution or transmission of the requests received. Where the central authority transmits the request to a competent authority for execution, it shall encourage the speedy and proper execution of the request by the competent authority. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the central authority designated for this purpose at the time each State Party deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of or accession to this Convention. Requests for mutual legal assistance and any communication related thereto shall be transmitted to the central authorities designated by the States Parties. This requirement shall be without prejudice to the right of a State Party to require that such requests and communications be addressed to it through diplomatic channels and, in urgent circumstances, where the States Parties agree, through the International Criminal Police Organization, if possible.   
14.  Requests shall be made in writing or, where possible, by any means capable of producing a written record, in a language acceptable to the requested State Party, under conditions allowing that State Party to establish authenticity. The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the language or languages acceptable to each State Party at the time it deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of or accession to this Convention. In urgent circumstances and where agreed by the States Parties, requests may be made orally but shall be confirmed in writing forthwith.   
15.  A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain: 

a) The identity of the authority making the request;  

b) The subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding to which the request relates and the name and functions of the authority conducting the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding;  

c) A summary of the relevant facts, except in relation to requests for the purpose of service of judicial documents;  

d) A description of the assistance sought and details of any particular procedure that the requesting State Party wishes to be followed;  

e) Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person concerned; and  

f) The purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought.     
16.  The requested State Party may request additional information when it appears necessary for the execution of the request in accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution.   
17.  A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic law of the requested State Party and, to the extent not contrary to the domestic law of the requested State Party and where possible, in accordance with the procedures specified in the request.   
18.  Wherever possible and consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law, when an individual is in the territory of a State Party and has to be heard as a witness or expert by the judicial authorities of another State Party, the first State Party may, at the request of the other, permit the hearing to take place by video conference if it is not possible or desirable for the individual in question to appear in person in the territory of the requesting State Party. States Parties may agree that the hearing shall be conducted by a judicial authority of the requesting State Party and attended by a judicial authority of the requested State Party.   
19.  The requesting State Party shall not transmit or use information or evidence furnished by the requested State Party for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings other than those stated in the request without the prior consent of the requested State Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the requesting State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evidence that is exculpatory to an accused person. In the latter case, the requesting State Party shall notify the requested State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the requested State Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the requesting State Party shall inform the requested State Party of the disclosure without delay.   
20.  The requesting State Party may require that the requested State Party keep confidential the fact and substance of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the requested State Party cannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting State Party.   
21.  Mutual legal assistance may be refused: 

a) If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this article;  

b) If the requested State Party considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, *ordre public* or other essential interests;  

c) If the authorities of the requested State Party would be prohibited by its domestic law from carrying out the action requested with regard to any similar offence, had it been subject to investigation, prosecution or judicial proceedings under their own jurisdiction;  

d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State Party relating to mutual legal assistance for the request to be granted.     
22.  States Parties may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.   
23.  Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance.   
24.  The requested State Party shall execute the request for mutual legal assistance as soon as possible and shall take as full account as possible of any deadlines suggested by the requesting State Party and for which reasons are given, preferably in the request. The requesting State Party may make reasonable requests for information on the status and progress of measures taken by the requested State Party to satisfy its request. The requested State Party shall respond to reasonable requests by the requesting State Party on the status, and progress in its handling, of the request. The requesting State Party shall promptly inform the requested State Party when the assistance sought is no longer required.   
25.  Mutual legal assistance may be postponed by the requested State Party on the ground that it interferes with an ongoing investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding.   
26.  Before refusing a request pursuant to paragraph 21 of this article or postponing its execution pursuant to paragraph 25 of this article, the requested State Party shall consult with the requesting State Party to consider whether assistance may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. If the requesting State Party accepts assistance subject to those conditions, it shall comply with the conditions.   
27.  Without prejudice to the application of paragraph 12 of this article, a witness, expert or other person who, at the request of the requesting State Party, consents to give evidence in a proceeding or to assist in an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding in the territory of the requesting State Party shall not be prosecuted, detained, punished or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in that territory in respect of acts, omissions or convictions prior to his or her departure from the territory of the requested State Party. Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert or other person having had, for a period of fifteen consecutive days or for any period agreed upon by the States Parties from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities, an opportunity of leaving, has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting State Party or, having left it, has returned of his or her own free will.   
28.  The ordinary costs of executing a request shall be borne by the requested State Party, unless otherwise agreed by the States Parties concerned. If expenses of a substantial or extraordinary nature are or will be required to fulfil the request, the States Parties shall consult to determine the terms and conditions under which the request will be executed, as well as the manner in which the costs shall be borne.   
29.  The requested State Party: 

a) Shall provide to the requesting State Party copies of government records, documents or information in its possession that under its domestic law are available to the general public;  

b) May, at its discretion, provide to the requesting State Party in whole, in part or subject to such conditions as it deems appropriate, copies of any government records, documents or information in its possession that under its domestic law are not available to the general public.     
30.  States Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the possibility of concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements that would serve the purposes of, give practical effect to or enhance the provisions of this article.

3.  Indien het verzoek om uitlevering diverse afzonderlijke strafbare feiten omvat, waarvan ten minste één strafbaar feit ingevolge dit artikel als uitleveringsdelict wordt aangemerkt terwijl andere niet als uitleveringsdelict worden aangemerkt vanwege de eraan verbonden periode van gevangenschap maar wel verband houden met de overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten, kan de aangezochte Staat die partij is dit artikel tevens ten aanzien van deze strafbare feiten toepassen.   
4.  Elk van de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt geacht te zijn opgenomen als een uitleveringsdelict in elk tussen de Staten die partij zijn bestaand uitleveringsverdrag. De Staten die partij zijn verplichten zich ertoe bedoelde strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder tussen hen te sluiten uitleveringsverdrag. In het geval een Staat die partij is dit Verdrag gebruikt als grondslag voor uitlevering, merkt hij, indien zijn nationale wet dit toestaat, overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten niet aan als politiek delicten.   
5.  Indien een Staat die partij is die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die partij is waarmee hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan hij dit Verdrag beschouwen als rechtsgrondslag voor uitlevering wat betreft de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is.   
6.  Een Staat die partij is die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag: 

a. stelt bij de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties ervan in kennis of hij dit Verdrag hanteert als de rechtsgrondslag voor medewerking aan uitlevering met andere Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag; en  

b. tracht, indien hij dit Verdrag niet hanteert als de rechtsgrondslag voor medewerking aan uitlevering, indien nodig, verdragen inzake uitlevering te sluiten met andere Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag teneinde dit artikel uit te voeren.     
7.  Staten die partij zijn die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag erkennen onderling de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is als uitleveringsdelicten.   
8.  Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de voorwaarden voorzien in het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is of in toepasselijke uitleveringsverdragen, met inbegrip van, onder andere, voorwaarden met betrekking tot de straf die minimaal vereist is voor uitlevering en de gronden waarop de aangezochte Staat die partij is uitlevering kan weigeren.   
9.  De Staten die partij zijn, trachten met inachtneming van hun nationale recht uitleveringsprocedures te bespoedigen en de vereisten betreffende de bewijslevering in dergelijke procedures te vereenvoudigen ten aanzien van elk strafbaar feit waarop dit artikel van toepassing is.   
10.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van zijn nationale wetgeving en zijn uitleveringsverdragen, kan de aangezochte Staat die partij is, nadat hij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden dit rechtvaardigen en dringend zijn en naar aanleiding van het verzoek van de verzoekende Staat die partij is, een persoon om wiens uitlevering wordt verzocht en die zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt in hechtenis nemen of andere passende maatregelen nemen om zijn of haar aanwezigheid bij de uitleveringsprocedure te waarborgen.   
11.  Een Staat die partij is op het grondgebied waarvan een vermeende dader wordt aangetroffen, is, indien hij een dergelijke persoon uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat hij of zij zijn onderdaan is niet uitlevert vanwege een strafbaar feit waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, verplicht om op verzoek van de om uitlevering verzoekende Staat die partij is de zaak zonder onnodige vertraging voor te leggen aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten ten behoeve van vervolging. Die autoriteiten nemen hun besluit en voeren hun procedures op dezelfde wijze uit als in het geval van andere ernstige strafbare feiten ingevolge het nationale recht van die Staat die partij is. De betrokken Staten die partij zijn, werken met elkaar samen, in het bijzonder op het gebied van procedures en bewijs, teneinde de doelmatigheid van de vervolging te waarborgen.   
12.  Wanneer het een Staat die partij is op grond van zijn nationale recht alleen is toegestaan een onderdaan uit te leveren of op andere wijze over te leveren onder de voorwaarde dat deze wordt teruggezonden naar die Staat die partij is om de straf te ondergaan die is opgelegd als gevolg van het proces of de procedure waarvoor om uitlevering of overlevering van de persoon werd verzocht, en deze Staat die partij is en de om uitlevering van de persoon verzoekende Staat die partij is, instemmen met deze optie en andere voorwaarden die zij gepast achten, is een dergelijke voorwaardelijke uitlevering of overlevering voldoende voor ontheffing van de in het elfde lid omschreven verplichting.   
13.  Indien een uitlevering, waarom wordt verzocht ten behoeve van de tenuitvoerlegging van een vonnis, wordt geweigerd omdat de gezochte persoon onderdaan is van de aangezochte Staat die partij is, neemt de aangezochte Staat die partij is, indien zijn nationale recht dat toestaat en overeenkomstig de vereisten van dat recht, op aanvraag van de verzoekende Partij de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis dat is gewezen krachtens het nationale recht van de verzoekende Staat die partij is, of van het resterende deel daarvan in overweging.   
14.  Elke persoon ten aanzien van wie procedures worden gevoerd in verband met een van de strafbare feiten waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt een eerlijke behandeling in alle fasen van het proces verzekerd, met inbegrip van het genot van alle rechten en waarborgen die zijn voorzien in het nationale recht van de Staat die partij is op het grondgebied waarvan die persoon zich bevindt.   
15.  Niets in dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat het een verplichting tot uitlevering zou inhouden indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is ernstige redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat het verzoek om uitlevering is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te straffen op grond van zijn geslacht, ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, etnische afkomst of politieke overtuiging of dat inwilliging van het verzoek de positie van die persoon om een van deze redenen ongunstig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.   
16.  De Staten die partij zijn, mogen een verzoek om uitlevering niet afwijzen uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat het strafbare feit geacht wordt tevens fiscale aangelegenheden te omvatten.   
17.  Alvorens uitlevering te weigeren, overlegt de aangezochte Staat die partij is, indien nodig, met de verzoekende Staat die partij is teneinde hem ruimschoots in de gelegenheid te stellen zijn opvattingen te presenteren en informatie te verstrekken ter staving van zijn beweringen.   
18.  De Staten die partij zijn, streven ernaar bilaterale en multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen te sluiten om uitlevering mogelijk te maken of de doeltreffendheid ervan te verhogen.   

### Artikel  45  

####Overbrenging van gevonniste personen

Staten die partij zijn, kunnen overwegen bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen te sluiten voor de overbrenging naar hun grondgebied van personen die zijn veroordeeld tot gevangenisstraf of andere vormen van vrijheidsbeneming voor overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten opdat zij het resterende deel van hun straf daar kunnen uitzitten.  

### Artikel  46  

####Wederzijdse rechtshulp

1.  De Staten die partij zijn, verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke wederzijdse rechtshulp bij de opsporing, vervolging en de gerechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen.   
2.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp wordt verleend in de ruimst mogelijke mate krachtens de relevante wetten, verdragen, overeenkomsten en regelingen van de aangezochte Staat die partij is met betrekking tot opsporing, vervolging en gerechtelijke procedures ten aanzien van de strafbare feiten waarvoor een rechtspersoon aansprakelijk kan worden gesteld overeenkomstig artikel 26 van dit Verdrag in de verzoekende Staat die partij is.   
3.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp die moet worden verleend overeenkomstig dit artikel kan worden verzocht voor elk van de volgende doeleinden: 

a. het opmaken van getuigenissen en verklaringen van personen;  

b. het betekenen van gerechtelijke documenten;  

c. het uitvoeren van huiszoekingen en inbeslagnemingen, alsmede bevriezing;  

d. het onderzoeken van voorwerpen en plaatsen;  

e. het verschaffen van informatie, stukken van overtuiging en beoordelingen door deskundigen;  

f. het verstrekken van originelen of gewaarmerkte afschriften van relevante documenten en dossiers, met inbegrip van bancaire, financiële, bedrijfs- of zakelijke dossiers;  

g. het identificeren of opsporen van opbrengsten van misdaad, goederen, hulpmiddelen of andere zaken ten behoeve van bewijsvoering;  

h. het vergemakkelijken van de vrijwillige verschijning van personen in de verzoekende Staat die partij is;  

i. elke andere vorm van hulp die niet in strijd is met het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is;  

j. het identificeren, bevriezen en opsporen van opbrengsten van misdaad overeenkomstig de bepalingen van hoofdstuk V van dit Verdrag;  

k. het terugkrijgen van activa overeenkomstig de bepalingen van hoofdstuk V van dit Verdrag.     
4.  Onverminderd het nationale recht kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Staat die partij is, zonder voorafgaand verzoek, informatie met betrekking tot criminele aangelegenheden zenden aan een bevoegde autoriteit in een andere Staat die partij is, indien zij aannemen dat deze informatie de autoriteit zou kunnen helpen bij het instellen of succesvol afsluiten van onderzoeken en strafrechtelijke procedures of zou kunnen leiden tot het formuleren van een verzoek krachtens dit Verdrag door de laatstgenoemde Staat die partij is.   
5.  De verzending van informatie ingevolge het vierde lid van dit artikel laat onderzoeken en strafrechtelijke procedures in de Staat van de bevoegde autoriteiten die de informatie verstrekken onverlet. De bevoegde autoriteiten die de informatie ontvangen, willigen een verzoek in om de genoemde informatie geheim te houden, ook tijdelijk, of beperkingen te stellen aan het gebruik ervan. Dit belet de ontvangende Staat die partij is evenwel niet tijdens zijn procedures informatie te verstrekken die ontlastend is voor een verdachte. In een dergelijk geval stelt de Staat die partij is de verzendende Staat die partij is voorafgaand aan de verstrekking daarvan in kennis, en overlegt, indien daarom is verzocht, met de verzendende Staat die partij is. Indien in een uitzonderlijk geval voorafgaande kennisgeving niet mogelijk is, stelt de ontvangende Staat die partij is de verzendende Staat die partij is onverwijld op de hoogte van de verstrekking.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel tasten de verplichtingen ingevolge een ander bilateraal of multilateraal verdrag dat wederzijdse rechtshulp geheel of ten dele regelt of zal regelen niet aan.   
7.  Het negende tot en met het negenentwintigste lid van dit artikel zijn van toepassing op ingevolge dit artikel gedane verzoeken indien de betrokken Staten die partij zijn niet gebonden worden door een verdrag inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp. Indien deze Staten die partij zijn gebonden zijn door een dergelijk verdrag, zijn de desbetreffende bepalingen van dat verdrag van toepassing, tenzij de Staten die partij zijn, overeenkomen in plaats daarvan het negende tot en met het negenentwintigste lid van dit artikel toe te passen. De Staten die partij zijn, worden sterk aangemoedigd deze leden toe te passen indien zij de samenwerking vergemakkelijken.   
8.  De Staten die partij zijn, weigeren niet wederzijdse rechtshulp ingevolge dit artikel te verlenen op grond van het bankgeheim.   
9.  

a. Een aangezochte Staat die partij is, die reageert op een verzoek om bijstand ingevolge dit artikel bij afwezigheid van dubbele strafbaarheid, houdt rekening met de doelen van dit Verdrag, zoals vervat in artikel 1;  

b. De Staten die partij zijn, mogen weigeren bijstand ingevolge dit artikel te verlenen op grond van het ontbreken van dubbele strafbaarheid. Een aangezochte Staat die partij is, verleent echter, wanneer dit in overeenstemming is met de grondbeginselen van zijn rechtsstelsel, bijstand waarbij geen sprake is van de toepassing van dwangmiddelen. Dergelijke bijstand kan worden geweigerd indien het verzoek zaken van ondergeschikt belang betreft of zaken waarvoor de gevraagde samenwerking of bijstand uit hoofde van andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag beschikbaar is;  

c. Elke Staat die partij is, kan overwegen maatregelen te nemen die nodig kunnen zijn om in ruimere mate hulp te kunnen bieden ingevolge dit artikel bij het ontbreken van dubbele strafbaarheid.     
10.  Een persoon die in hechtenis zit of een straf ondergaat op het grondgebied van een Staat die partij is, wiens aanwezigheid op het grondgebied van een andere Staat die partij is wordt verzocht voor identificatie, verhoor of een andere wijze van medewerking bij de verkrijging van bewijs voor opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures met betrekking tot strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, mag worden overgebracht, indien wordt voldaan aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. de persoon geeft vrijwillig zijn of haar toestemming op basis van volledige informatie;  

b. de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten die partij zijn, stemmen ermee in, overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die die Staten die partij zijn eventueel gepast achten.     
11.  Voor de toepassing van het tiende lid van dit artikel: 

a. is de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht bevoegd en verplicht de overgebrachte persoon in hechtenis te houden, tenzij hij anderszins verzocht of gemachtigd wordt door de Staat die partij is van waaruit de persoon is overgebracht;  

b. komt de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht onverwijld zijn verplichting na tot terugzending van de persoon voor inhechtenisneming door de Staat die partij is van waaruit deze persoon is overgebracht zoals vooraf overeengekomen, of op andere wijze overeengekomen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten die partij zijn;  

c. verlangt de Staat die partij is waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht niet van de Staat die partij is van waaruit de persoon is overgebracht dat deze een uitleveringsprocedure begint ten behoeve van de terugkeer van de persoon;  

d. krijgt de overgebrachte persoon vermindering van de straf die hij of zij in de Staat vanwaar hij of zij is overgebracht moet uitzitten met de periode die hij of zij in hechtenis heeft doorgebracht in de Staat die partij is waarnaar hij of zij is overgebracht.     
12.  Tenzij de Staat die partij is van waaruit een persoon overeenkomstig het tiende en elfde lid van dit artikel moet worden overgebracht daarvoor toestemming geeft, wordt die persoon, ongeacht zijn of haar nationaliteit, niet vervolgd of in hechtenis genomen, noch aan enige andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid onderworpen op het grondgebied van de Staat waarnaar deze persoon wordt overgebracht wegens handelen, nalaten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de Staat van waaruit deze persoon is overgebracht.   
13.  Elke Staat die partij is, wijst een centrale autoriteit aan die de verantwoordelijkheid draagt voor en bevoegd is tot het ontvangen van verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp en deze ofwel uit te voeren ofwel ter uitvoering te zenden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten. Indien een Staat die partij is een speciale regio of speciaal grondgebied heeft met een afzonderlijk stelsel voor wederzijdse rechtshulp, kan hij een aparte centrale autoriteit aanwijzen die dezelfde functie vervult voor die regio of dat grondgebied. De centrale autoriteiten verzekeren de spoedige en goede uitvoering of verzending van de ontvangen verzoeken. Indien de centrale autoriteit het verzoek ter uitvoering aan een bevoegde autoriteit zendt, moedigt zij de spoedige en goede uitvoering van het verzoek door de bevoegde autoriteit aan. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties wordt in kennis gesteld van de voor dit doel aangewezen centrale autoriteit op het tijdstip van nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag door elke Staat die partij is. De verzoeken om wederzijdse rechtshulp en mededelingen die daarmee verband houden worden gezonden aan de door de Staten die partij zijn aangewezen centrale autoriteiten. Dit vereiste geldt onverminderd het recht van een Staat die partij is te verlangen dat dergelijke verzoeken en mededelingen langs diplomatieke weg aan hem worden gericht en, in geval van nood, indien de Staten die partij zijn dat overeenkomen, zo mogelijk door tussenkomst van de Internationale Criminele Politieorganisatie.   
14.  De verzoeken worden schriftelijk gedaan, of waar mogelijk met elk middel waarmee een schriftelijk document kan worden geproduceerd, in een voor de aangezochte Staat die partij is aanvaardbare taal, onder voorwaarden die het die Staat die partij is mogelijk maken de authenticiteit vast te stellen. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties wordt in kennis gesteld van de voor elke Staat die partij is aanvaardbare taal of talen op het tijdstip van de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag door elke Staat die partij is. In geval van nood en indien overeengekomen door de Staten die partij zijn, kunnen verzoeken mondeling worden gedaan, maar dienen zij onverwijld schriftelijk te worden bevestigd.   
15.  Een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp bevat: 

a. de identiteit van de autoriteit die het verzoek doet;  

b. het onderwerp en de aard van de opsporing, de vervolging of de gerechtelijke procedure waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft en de naam en functie van de autoriteit die de opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure uitvoert;  

c. een samenvatting van de relevante feiten, met uitzondering van verzoeken ten behoeve van de betekening van gerechtelijke documenten;  

d. een beschrijving van de gewenste rechtshulp en de details van de specifieke procedure waarvan de verzoekende Staat die partij is wenst dat die gevolgd wordt;  

e. waar mogelijk de identiteit, het adres en de nationaliteit van de betrokken personen; en  

f. het doel waarvoor om het bewijsmateriaal, de informatie of de maatregelen wordt verzocht.     
16.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is, kan verzoeken om aanvullende informatie indien deze noodzakelijk blijkt voor de uitvoering van het verzoek overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht of wanneer deze de uitvoering kan vergemakkelijken.   
17.  Een verzoek wordt uitgevoerd overeenkomstig het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is en, voorzover niet in strijd met het nationale recht van de aangezochte Staat die partij is, en waar mogelijk, overeenkomstig de in het verzoek omschreven procedures.   
18.  Indien een persoon zich op het grondgebied van een Staat die partij is bevindt en als getuige of deskundige gehoord moet worden door de gerechtelijke autoriteiten van een andere Staat die partij is, kan de eerste Staat die partij is, op verzoek van de andere, waar mogelijk en overeenkomstig de grondbeginselen van het nationale recht, toestaan dat het verhoor plaatsvindt door middel van videoconferencing, indien het voor de persoon in kwestie niet mogelijk of wenselijk is persoonlijk te verschijnen op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is. De Staten die partij zijn, kunnen overeenkomen dat het verhoor wordt uitgevoerd door een gerechtelijke autoriteit van de verzoekende Staat die partij is en wordt bijgewoond door een gerechtelijke autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat die partij is.   
19.  De verzoekende Staat die partij is, gebruikt of zendt geen informatie of bewijsmateriaal verstrekt door de aangezochte Staat die partij is voor opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures anders dan vermeld in het verzoek zonder voorafgaande toestemming van de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Niets in dit lid belet de verzoekende Staat die partij is tijdens zijn procedures informatie of bewijsmateriaal bekend te maken die respectievelijk dat ontlastend is voor een verdachte. In het laatste geval stelt de verzoekende Staat die partij is de aangezochte Staat die partij is voorafgaand aan de bekendmaking daarvan in kennis, en overlegt, indien daarom is verzocht, met de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Indien in een uitzonderlijk geval voorafgaande kennisgeving niet mogelijk is, stelt de verzoekende Staat die partij is de aangezochte Staat die partij is onverwijld op de hoogte van de bekendmaking.   
20.  De verzoekende Staat die partij is, kan verlangen dat de aangezochte Staat die partij is het bestaan en de inhoud van het verzoek geheimhoudt, behalve voorzover bekendmaking nodig is voor de uitvoering van het verzoek. Indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is niet kan voldoen aan het vereiste van geheimhouding, stelt hij de verzoekende Staat die partij is daarvan onverwijld op de hoogte.   
21.  Wederzijdse rechtshulp kan worden geweigerd: 

a. indien het verzoek niet wordt gedaan overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel;  

b. indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is uitvoering van het verzoek schadelijk acht voor zijn soevereiniteit, veiligheid, openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen;  

c. indien het de autoriteiten van de aangezochte Staat die partij is krachtens zijn nationale recht verboden zou zijn de verzochte maatregel uit te voeren ten behoeve van een vergelijkbaar strafbaar feit, indien het onder hun eigen rechtsmacht zou worden onderworpen aan opsporing, vervolging of een gerechtelijke procedure;  

d. indien het in strijd zou zijn met het rechtsstelsel van de aangezochte Staat die partij is met betrekking tot wederzijdse rechtshulp om het verzoek te honoreren.     
22.  De Staten die partij zijn, mogen een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp niet afwijzen uitsluitend op grond van het feit dat het strafbare feit geacht wordt tevens fiscale aangelegenheden te omvatten.   
23.  Elke weigering van wederzijdse rechtshulp wordt met redenen omkleed.   
24.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is, voert het verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp zo spoedig mogelijk uit en houdt zoveel mogelijk rekening met eventuele uiterste termijnen die door de verzoekende Staat die partij is zijn vermeld en die met redenen zijn omkleed, bij voorkeur in het verzoek. De verzoekende Staat die partij is, kan redelijke verzoeken doen om informatie over de status en voortgang van maatregelen die door de aangezochte Staat die partij is zijn genomen om aan zijn verzoek te voldoen. De aangezochte Staat die partij is, antwoordt op redelijke verzoeken van de verzoekende Staat die partij is om informatie over de status en voortgang van de behandeling van het verzoek. De verzoekende Staat die partij is, stelt de aangezochte Staat die partij is onverwijld in kennis indien de verzochte rechtshulp niet langer nodig is.   
25.  De wederzijdse rechtshulp kan door de aangezochte Staat die partij is worden uitgesteld op grond van het feit dat een lopend onderzoek, een lopende vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure hierdoor wordt doorkruist.   
26.  Alvorens een verzoek ingevolge het eenentwintigste lid van dit artikel te weigeren of de uitvoering ervan uit te stellen ingevolge het vijfentwintigste lid van dit artikel, overlegt de aangezochte Staat die partij is met de verzoekende Staat die partij is om te overwegen of rechtshulp kan worden verleend onder de door hem nodig geachte voorwaarden en bepalingen. Indien de verzoekende Staat die partij is rechtshulp aanvaardt onder die voorwaarden, dient hij daaraan te voldoen.   
27.  Onverminderd de toepassing van het twaalfde lid van dit artikel, wordt een getuige, deskundige of andere persoon die op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat die partij is ermee instemt te getuigen in een procedure of mee te werken aan een onderzoek, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedure op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is, niet vervolgd, in hechtenis genomen, gestraft of onderworpen aan een andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid op dat grondgebied ten aanzien van handelen, nalaten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de aangezochte Staat die partij is. Een dergelijk vrijgeleide houdt op wanneer de getuige, deskundige of andere persoon gedurende vijftien achtereenvolgende dagen of gedurende een door de Staten die partij zijn overeengekomen tijdvak vanaf de datum waarop hij of zij officieel ervan in kennis is gesteld dat zijn of haar aanwezigheid niet langer verlangd wordt door de gerechtelijke autoriteiten, de mogelijkheid heeft gekregen te vertrekken, niettemin vrijwillig gebleven is op het grondgebied van de verzoekende Staat die partij is of, na te zijn vertrokken, vrijwillig is teruggekeerd.   
28.  De gewone kosten voor de uitvoering van een verzoek worden gedragen door de aangezochte Staat die partij is, tenzij anders is overeengekomen door de betrokken Staten die partij zijn. Indien met de uitvoering van het verzoek aanzienlijke kosten of kosten van buitengewone aard zijn of zullen zijn gemoeid, plegen de Staten die partij zijn overleg om de voorwaarden en omstandigheden te bepalen waaronder het verzoek zal worden uitgevoerd, alsmede de wijze waarop de kosten worden gedragen.   
29.  De aangezochte Staat die partij is: 

a. verstrekt aan de verzoekende Staat die partij is afschriften van overheidsdossiers, -documenten of -informatie waarover hij beschikt die krachtens zijn nationale wet toegankelijk zijn voor het algemene publiek;  

b. kan, naar eigen oordeel, aan de verzoekende Staat die partij is geheel of gedeeltelijk of onder door hem passend geachte voorwaarden, afschriften van overheidsdossiers, -documenten of -informatie waarover hij beschikt verstrekken die krachtens zijn nationale wet niet toegankelijk zijn voor het algemene publiek.     
30.  De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen, indien nodig, de mogelijkheid van het aangaan van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen die dienstig zijn voor, praktische uitvoering geven aan of bevorderlijk zijn voor de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  47  

####Overdracht van strafvervolging

De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen de mogelijkheid strafvervolging aan elkaar over te dragen van een overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit in de gevallen waarin een dergelijke overdracht geacht wordt in het belang te zijn van een goede rechtsbedeling, in het bijzonder in gevallen waarbij diverse jurisdicties betrokken zijn, teneinde de vervolging te concentreren.  

### Artikel  48  

####Samenwerking op het gebied van rechtshandhaving

1.  De Staten die partij zijn, werken in overeenstemming met hun onderscheiden nationale rechtsstelsels en bestuurlijke stelsels nauw met elkaar samen teneinde de doeltreffendheid te bevorderen van handhavingsmaatregelen ter bestrijding van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen. De Staten die partij zijn, nemen in het bijzonder doeltreffende maatregelen teneinde: 

a. communicatiekanalen te verbeteren en waar nodig te creëren tussen hun bevoegde autoriteiten, organisaties en diensten ter vergemakkelijking van de veilige en snelle uitwisseling van informatie met betrekking tot alle aspecten van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, met inbegrip van, indien de Staten die partij zijn dit van toepassing achten, verbanden met andere criminele activiteiten;  

b. samen te werken met andere Staten die partij zijn bij de opsporing ten aanzien van strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen betreffende: 

i. de identiteit, verblijfplaats en activiteiten van personen die worden verdacht van betrokkenheid bij die strafbare feiten of de verblijfplaats van andere betrokkenen;  

ii. de bewegingen van opbrengsten van misdaad of goederen verkregen door het plegen van dergelijke strafbare feiten;  

iii. de bewegingen van goederen, benodigdheden of andere hulpmiddelen gebruikt of bedoeld voor gebruik bij het plegen van die strafbare feiten;    

c. indien van toepassing de nodige goederen of hoeveelheden stoffen te verstrekken ten behoeve van analyse of opsporing;  

d. indien van toepassing, informatie uit te wisselen met andere Staten die partij zijn met betrekking tot specifieke middelen en methoden om de strafbare feiten te plegen die onder dit Verdrag vallen, met inbegrip van het gebruik van valse identiteiten, gewijzigde, vervalste of valse documenten of andere middelen om hun activiteiten te verhelen;  

e. doeltreffende coördinatie tussen hun bevoegde autoriteiten, organisaties en diensten te vergemakkelijken en de uitwisseling te bevorderen van personeel en andere deskundigen, met inbegrip van, met inachtneming van bilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen tussen de betrokken Staten die partij zijn, de detachering van verbindingsofficieren;  

f. informatie uit te wisselen en bestuursrechtelijke en andere maatregelen te coördineren die waar nodig zijn genomen ten behoeve van de vroegtijdige ontdekking van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen.     
2.  Teneinde uitvoering te geven aan dit Verdrag, overwegen de Staten die partij zijn bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen aan te gaan inzake rechtstreekse samenwerking tussen hun rechtshandhavingsorganisaties en, indien dergelijke overeenkomsten of regelingen reeds bestaan, deze aan te passen. Bij ontbreken van dergelijke overeenkomsten of regelingen tussen de betrokken Staten die partij zijn, kunnen de Staten die partij zijn overwegen dit Verdrag te beschouwen als de grondslag voor wederzijdse samenwerking op het gebied van rechtshandhaving ten aanzien van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen. Indien van toepassing, maken de Staten die partij zijn volledig gebruik van overeenkomsten of regelingen, met inbegrip van internationale of regionale organisaties, ter versterking van de samenwerking tussen hun rechtshandhavingsorganisaties.   
3.  De Staten die partij zijn, trachten waar dat in hun vermogen ligt samen te werken teneinde het hoofd te bieden aan de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen en worden gepleegd met behulp van moderne technologie.   

### Artikel  49  

####Gezamenlijke opsporing

De Staten die partij zijn, overwegen het aangaan van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen op grond waarvan ten behoeve van aangelegenheden die het voorwerp zijn van opsporing, vervolging of gerechtelijke procedures in een of meer Staten, de betrokken bevoegde autoriteiten gemeenschappelijke opsporingsinstanties kunnen oprichten. Bij het ontbreken van dergelijke overeenkomsten of regelingen kunnen gezamenlijke opsporingen op ad hoc-basis worden overeengekomen. De betrokken Staten die partij zijn, verzekeren dat de soevereiniteit van de Staat die partij is op het grondgebied waarvan een dergelijke opsporing moet plaatsvinden volledig wordt geëerbiedigd.  

### Artikel  50  

####Speciale opsporingstechnieken

1.  Teneinde corruptie doeltreffend te bestrijden neemt elke Staat die partij is, voorzover toegestaan volgens de grondbeginselen van zijn nationale rechtsstelsel en onder de door zijn nationale recht voorgeschreven voorwaarden, binnen zijn mogelijkheden de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn ten behoeve van het passend gebruik van gecontroleerde aflevering en, wanneer hij dat passend acht, voor het gebruik van andere speciale opsporingstechnieken, zoals elektronisch of andere vormen van toezicht en infiltratie-operaties, door zijn bevoegde autoriteiten op zijn grondgebied, en laat daaruit verkregen bewijsmateriaal toe in gerechtelijke procedures.   
2.  Ten behoeve van de opsporing van de strafbare feiten die onder dit Verdrag vallen, worden de Staten die partij zijn aangemoedigd, indien noodzakelijk, passende bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten of regelingen aan te gaan voor het gebruik van dergelijke speciale opsporingstechnieken in het kader van samenwerking op internationaal niveau. Deze overeenkomsten of regelingen worden aangegaan en uitgevoerd onder volledige eerbiediging van het grondbeginsel van de soevereine gelijkheid van Staten en worden onder strikte naleving van de bepalingen van die overeenkomsten of regelingen uitgevoerd.   
3.  Bij het ontbreken van een overeenkomst of regeling als bedoeld in het tweede lid van dit artikel, worden de beslissingen om die speciale opsporingstechnieken te gebruiken op internationaal niveau op ad-hocbasis genomen, waarbij zo nodig rekening wordt gehouden met financiële regelingen en akkoorden ten aanzien van de uitoefening van de rechtsmacht door de betrokken Staten die partij zijn.   
4.  De beslissingen over gecontroleerde aflevering op internationaal niveau kunnen, met de instemming van de betrokken Staten die partij zijn, methoden betreffen zoals het onderscheppen van goederen en fondsen en het toestaan dat deze goederen of fondsen intact worden gelaten of geheel of gedeeltelijk worden verwijderd of vervangen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####HET TERUGKRIJGEN VAN ACTIVA

### Artikel  51  

####Algemene bepaling

De teruggave van activa ingevolge dit hoofdstuk vormt een grondbeginsel van dit Verdrag en de Staten die partij zijn werken in dit opzicht in de ruimst mogelijke zin met elkaar samen en verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke hulp.  

### Artikel  52  

####Voorkomen en opsporen van de overmaking van opbrengsten van misdaad

1.  Onverminderd artikel 14 van dit Verdrag, neemt elke Staat die partij is de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn, overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht, om de financiële instellingen die onder zijn rechtsmacht vallen te verplichten de identiteit van cliënten te verifiëren, redelijke stappen te nemen om de identiteit vast te stellen van uiteindelijk begunstigden van fondsen die op rekeningen waarop grote bedragen staan zijn gestort en scherper toezicht te houden op rekeningen die personen die belangrijke openbare functies bekleden of hebben bekleed, alsmede hun familieleden en mensen in hun directe omgeving aanhouden of willen openen of die tussenpersonen namens hen aanhouden of willen openen. Een dergelijke verscherpte controle wordt redelijkerwijs opgezet om verdachte transacties op te sporen teneinde deze ter kennis te brengen van de bevoegde autoriteiten en mogen niet zodanig zijn dat zij financiële instellingen ervan weerhouden of verbieden met legitieme cliënten zaken te doen.   
2.  Teneinde de invoering van de maatregelen voorzien in het eerste lid van dit artikel te vergemakkelijken, neemt elke Staat die partij is, overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht en ingegeven door relevante initiatieven van regionale, interregionale en multilaterale organisaties gericht tegen het witwassen, de volgende maatregelen: 

a. het publiceren van richtlijnen inzake het soort natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon op wiens rekeningen de financiële instellingen binnen zijn rechtsmacht verscherpte controle zouden moeten uitoefenen, het soort rekeningen en transacties waaraan bijzondere aandacht moet worden besteed en de passende maatregelen die moeten worden genomen ten aanzien van het openen en bijhouden van dergelijke rekeningen en het documentenbeheer met betrekking daartoe; en  

b. waar passend, het op de hoogte stellen van financiële instellingen binnen zijn rechtsmacht, op verzoek van een andere Staat die partij is of uit eigen beweging, van de identiteit van een bepaalde natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon op wiens rekeningen dergelijke instellingen verscherpte controle moeten uitoefenen, in aanvulling op personen die de financiële instellingen daarnaast zouden kunnen identificeren.     
3.  In het kader van het tweede lid, onderdeel a, van dit artikel voert elke Staat die partij is maatregelen in om te verzekeren dat zijn financiële instellingen adequate dossiers bijhouden, gedurende een passend tijdvak, van rekeningen en transacties waarbij de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde personen betrokken zijn, die ten minste gegevens moeten bevatten over de identiteit van de cliënt en, voorzover mogelijk, van de uiteindelijk gerechtigde.   
4.  Met het oog op het voorkomen en ontdekken van overmakingen van opbrengsten van overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten, voert elke Staat die partij is passende en doeltreffende maatregelen in om, met behulp van zijn regelgevende en toezichthoudende autoriteiten, de vestiging te voorkomen van banken die niet fysiek aanwezig zijn en niet zijn aangesloten bij een gereguleerde financiële groep. Daarnaast kunnen Staten die partij zijn overwegen hun financiële instellingen te verplichten te weigeren betrekkingen als correspondentbank aan te gaan of voort te zetten met dergelijke instellingen en zich te hoeden voor het aangaan van betrekkingen met buitenlandse financiële instellingen die toestaan dat hun rekeningen worden gebruikt door banken die niet fysiek aanwezig zijn en niet zijn aangesloten bij een gereguleerde financiële groep.   
5.  Elke Staat die partij is, overweegt, overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht, het instellen van doeltreffende systemen voor het verstrekken van financiële informatie voor de daarvoor in aanmerking komende overheidsfunctionarissen en voorziet in passende sancties in geval van niet-naleving. Elke Staat die partij is, overweegt tevens de maatregelen te nemen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn bevoegde autoriteiten toe te staan informatie te delen met de bevoegde autoriteiten in andere Staten die partij zijn wanneer dit nodig is voor het onderzoeken, vorderen en terugkrijgen van de opbrengsten van overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten.   
6.  Elke Staat die partij is, overweegt de maatregelen te nemen die nodig kunnen zijn, overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht, om daarvoor in aanmerking komende overheidsfunctionarissen die een belang hebben in of een tekenbevoegdheid of andere bevoegdheid hebben ter zake van een financiële rekening in het buitenland te verplichten deze relatie ter kennis te brengen van de bevoegde autoriteiten en van deze rekeningen een adequate administratie bij te houden. Dergelijke maatregelen voorzien tevens in passende sancties bij niet-naleving.   

### Artikel  53  

####Maatregelen voor het rechtstreeks terugkrijgen van goederen

Overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht, neemt elke Staat die partij is: 

a. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om een andere Staat die partij is toe te staan een civiele vordering bij zijn rechters aanhangig te maken ter vaststelling van de titel op of de eigendom van goederen die zijn verworven door het plegen van een overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit;  

b. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn rechters toe te staan degenen die overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten hebben gepleegd te gelasten schadeloosstelling te betalen aan de andere Staat die partij is die door dergelijke strafbare feiten schade heeft geleden; en  

c. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn rechters of bevoegde autoriteiten, wanneer deze voor het besluit staan of zij tot confiscatie overgaan, toe te staan de vordering te erkennen van de andere Staat die partij is als rechtmatig eigenaar van goederen die zijn verworven door het plegen van een overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit.    

### Artikel  54  

####Mechanismen voor het terugkrijgen van goederen door internationale samenwerking bij confiscatie

1.  Overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht neemt elke Staat die partij is, met het oog op het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp krachtens artikel 55 van dit Verdrag met betrekking tot goederen die verworven zijn door of betrokken zijn bij het plegen van een overeenkomstig dit Verdrag strafbaar gesteld feit: 

a. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn bevoegde autoriteiten toe te staan uitvoering te geven aan een bevel tot confiscatie uitgevaardigd door een rechter van een andere Staat die partij is;

c. overweegt de Staat die partij is het nemen van de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om toe te staan dat dergelijke goederen worden geconfisqueerd zonder dat een strafrechtelijke veroordeling vereist is in zaken waarin de dader niet vervolgd kan worden vanwege zijn overlijden, vlucht of afwezigheid, of in andere van toepassing zijnde gevallen.     
2.  Overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht, neemt elke Staat die partij is, met het oog op het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp na een krachtens artikel 55, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag gedaan verzoek: 

a. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn bevoegde autoriteiten toe te staan goederen te bevriezen of in beslag te nemen na een bevel daartoe uitgevaardigd door een rechter of bevoegde autoriteit van een verzoekende Staat die partij is, dat voor de aangezochte Staat die partij is een redelijke basis is om aan te nemen dat er voldoende gronden bestaan voor het nemen van dergelijke maatregelen en dat op de goederen uiteindelijk een bevel tot confiscatie van toepassing zou zijn voor de uitvoering van het eerste lid, onderdeel a, van dit artikel;  

b. de maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn om zijn bevoegde autoriteiten toe te staan goederen te bevriezen of in beslag te nemen na een verzoek daartoe dat voor de aangezochte Staat een redelijke basis vormt om aan te nemen dat er voldoende gronden bestaan voor het nemen van dergelijke maatregelen en dat op de goederen uiteindelijk een bevel tot confiscatie van toepassing zou zijn voor de uitvoering van het eerste lid, onderdeel a, van dit artikel; en  

c. overweegt de Staat die partij is het nemen van aanvullende maatregelen om zijn bevoegde autoriteiten toe te staan goederen veilig te stellen voor confiscatie, zoals op grond van een aanhouding of vervolging in het buitenland met betrekking tot de verwerving van dergelijke goederen.

5.  Elke Staat die partij is, verstrekt de tekst van zijn wetten en voorschriften die gevolg geven aan dit artikel en van alle latere wijzigingen van die wetten en voorschriften of een beschrijving daarvan aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.

7.  Samenwerking krachtens dit artikel kan tevens worden geweigerd of voorlopige maatregelen kunnen worden opgeheven indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is niet tijdig voldoende bewijsmateriaal ontvangt of indien de goederen een zeer geringe waarde hebben.   
8.  Alvorens krachtens dit artikel een voorlopige maatregel op te heffen, geeft de aangezochte Staat die partij is, wanneer mogelijk, de verzoekende Staat die partij is de gelegenheid zijn argumenten uiteen te zetten die voor voortzetting van de maatregel pleiten.
