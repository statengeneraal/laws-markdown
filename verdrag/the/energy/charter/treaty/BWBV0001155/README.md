c) The conciliator shall seek the agreement of the parties to the dispute to a resolution thereof or upon a procedure to achieve such resolution. If within 90 days of his appointment he has failed to secure such agreement, he shall recommend a resolution to the dispute or a procedure to achieve such resolution and shall decide the interim tariffs and other terms and conditions to be observed for Transit from a date which he shall specify until the dispute is resolved.

4.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to 3, a Contracting Party may protect the rights of creditors, or ensure compliance with laws on the issuing, trading and dealing in securities and the satisfaction of judgements in civil, administrative and criminal adjudicatory proceedings, through the equitable, non-discriminatory, and good faith application of its laws and regulations.   
5.  Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Contracting Parties which are states that were constituent parts of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics may provide in agreements concluded between them that transfers of payments shall be made in the currencies of such Contracting Parties, provided that such agreements do not treat Investments in their Areas of Investors of other Contracting Parties less favourably than either Investments of Investors of the Contracting Parties which have entered into such agreements or Investments of Investors of any third state.

### PART  II  

### 1  

Where, in making an award, the tribunal finds that a measure of a regional or local government or authority of a Contracting Party (hereinafter referred to as the “Responsible Party") is not in conformity with a provision of this Treaty, the Responsible Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure observance of the Treaty in respect of the measure.  

### 2  

The Responsible Party shall, within 30 days from the date the award is made, provide to the Secretariat written notice of its intentions as to ensuring observance of the Treaty in respect of the measure. The Secretariat shall present the notification to the Charter Conference at the earliest practicable opportunity, and no later than the meeting of the Charter Conference following receipt of the notice. If it is impracticable to ensure observance immediately, the Responsible Party shall have a reasonable period of time in which to do so. The reasonable period of time shall be agreed by both parties to the dispute. In the event that such agreement is not reached, the Responsible Party shall propose a reasonable period for approval by the Charter Conference.  

### 3  

Where the Responsible Party fails, within the reasonable period of time, to ensure observance in respect of the measure, it shall at the request of the other Contracting Party party to the dispute (hereinafter referred to as the “Injured Party") endeavour to agree with the Injured Party on appropriate compensation as a mutually satisfactory resolution of the dispute.  

### 4  

If no satisfactory compensation has been agreed within 20 days of the request of the Injured Party, the Injured Party may with the authorization of the Charter Conference suspend such of its obligations to the Responsible Party under the Treaty as it considers equivalent to those denied by the measure in question, until such time as the Contracting Parties have reached agreement on a resolution of their dispute or the non-conforming measure has been brought into conformity with the Treaty.  

### 5  

In considering what obligations to suspend, the Injured Party shall apply the following principles and procedures: 

a) The Injured Party should first seek to suspend obligations with respect to the same Part of the Treaty as that in which the tribunal has found a violation.  

b) If the Injured Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations with respect to the same Part of the Treaty, it may seek to suspend obligations in other Parts of the Treaty. If the Injured Party decides to request authorization to suspend obligations under this subparagraph, it shall state the reasons therefor in its request to the Charter Conference for authorization.    

### 6  

On written request of the Responsible Party, delivered to the Injured Party and to the President of the tribunal that rendered the award, the tribunal shall determine whether the level of obligations suspended by the Injured Party is excessive, and if so, to what extent. If the tribunal cannot be reconstituted, such determination shall be made by one or more arbitrators appointed by the Secretary-General. Determinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be completed within 60 days of the request to the tribunal or the appointment by the Secretary-General. Obligations shall not be suspended pending the determination, which shall be final and binding.  

### 7  

In suspending any obligations to a Responsible Party, an Injured Party shall make every effort not to affect adversely the rights under the Treaty of any other Contracting Party.

### (B)  

####Rules Governing the Application of Provisions of the WTO Agreement.

1. In the absence of a relevant interpretation of the WTO Agreement adopted by the Ministerial Conference or the General Council of the World Trade Organization under paragraph 2 of article IX of the WTO Agreement concerning provisions applicable under Article 29(2)(a), the Charter Conference may adopt an interpretation.  

2. Requests for waivers under Article 29(2) and (6)(b) shall be submitted to the Charter Conference, which shall follow, in carrying out these duties, the procedures of paragraphs 3 and 4 of article IX of the WTO Agreement.  

3. Waivers of obligations in force in the WTO shall be considered in force for the purposes of Article 29 while they remain in force in the WTO.  

4. The provisions of article II of the GATT 1994 which have not been disapplied shall, without prejudice to Article 29(4), (5) and (7), be modified as follows: 

(i) All Energy Materials and Products listed in Annex EM II and Energy-Related Equipment listed in Annex EQ II imported from or exported to any other Contracting Party shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation, in excess of those imposed on the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7), or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the importing or exporting territory on the date referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence.  

(ii) Nothing in article II of the GATT 1994 shall prevent any Contracting Party from imposing at any time on the importation or exportation of any product: 

a) a charge equivalent to an internal tax imposed consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article III of GATT 1994 in respect of the like domestic product or in respect of an article from which the imported product has been manufactured or produced in whole or in part;  

b) any anti-dumping or countervailing duty applied consistently with the provisions of article VI of GATT 1994;  

c) fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services rendered.    

(iii) No Contracting Party shall alter its method of determining dutiable value or of converting currencies so as to impair the value of the standstill obligations provided for in Article 29(6) or (7).  

(iv) If any Contracting Party establishes, maintains or authorises, formally or in effect, a monopoly of the importation or exportation of any Energy Material or Product listed in Annex EM II or in respect of Energy-Related Equipment listed in EQ II, such monopoly shall not operate so as to afford protection on the average in excess of the amount of protection permitted by the standstill obligation provided for in Article 29(6) or (7). The provisions of this paragraph shall not limit the use by Contracting Parties of any form of assistance to domestic producers permitted by other provisions of this Treaty.  

(v) If any Contracting Party considers that a product is not receiving from another Contracting Party the treatment which the first Contracting Party believes to have been contemplated by the standstill obligation provided for in Article 29(6) or (7), it shall bring the matter directly to the attention of the other Contracting Party. If the latter agrees that the treatment contemplated was that claimed by the first Contracting Party, but declares that such treatment cannot be accorded because a court or other proper authority has ruled to the effect that the product involved cannot be classified under the tariff laws of such Contracting Party so as to permit the treatment contemplated in this Treaty, the two Contracting Parties, together with any other Contracting Parties substantially interested, shall enter promptly into further negotiations with a view to a compensatory adjustment of the matter.  

(vi) 

a) The specific duties and charges included in the Tariff Record relating to the Contracting Parties members of the International Monetary Fund, and margins of preference in specific duties and charges maintained by such Contracting Parties, are expressed in the appropriate currency at the par value accepted or provisionally recognized by the Fund at the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7). Accordingly, in case this par value is reduced consistently with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund by more than twenty per centum, such specific duties and charges and margins of preference may be adjusted to take account of such reduction; Provided that the Conference concurs that such adjustments will not impair the value of the standstill obligation provided for in Article 29(6) or (7) or elsewhere in this Treaty, due account being taken of all factors which may influence the need for, or urgency of, such adjustments.  

b) Similar provisions shall apply to any Contracting Party not a member of the Fund, as from the date on which such Contracting Party becomes a member of the Fund or enters into a special exchange agreement in pursuance of Article XV of GATT 1994.    

(vii) Each Contracting Party shall notify the Secretariat of the customs duties and charges of any kind applicable on the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6) first sentence. The Secretariat shall keep a Tariff Record of the customs duties and charges of any kind relevant for the purpose of the standstill on customs duties and charges of any kind under Article 29(6) or (7).    

5. The Decision of 26 March 1980 on “Introduction of a Loose-Leaf System for the Schedules of Tariff Concessions” (BISD 27S/24) shall not be applicable under Article 29(2)(a). The applicable provisions of the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 shall, without prejudice to Article 29(4), (5) or (7), apply with the following modifications: 

(i) In order to ensure transparency of the legal rights and obligations deriving from paragraph 1(b) of article II of GATT 1994, the nature and level of any “other duties or charges” levied on any Energy Materials and Products listed in Annex EM II or Energy-Related Equipment listed in Annex EQ II with respect to their importation or exportation, as referred to in that provision, shall be recorded in the Tariff Record at the levels applying at the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7) respectively, against the tariff item to which they apply. It is understood that such recording does not change the legal character of “other duties or charges”.  

(ii) “Other duties or charges” shall be recorded in respect of all Energy Materials and Products listed in Annex EM II and Energy-Related Equipment listed in Annex EQ II.  

(iii) It will be open to any Contracting Party to challenge the existence of an “other duty or charge”, on the ground that no such “other duty or charge” existed at the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or the relevant date under Article 29(7), for the item in question, as well as the consistency of the recorded level of any “other duty or charge” with the standstill obligation provided for by Article 29(6) or (7), for a period of one year after the entry into force of the Amendment to the trade-related provisions of this Treaty, adopted by the Charter Conference on 24 April 1998, or one year after the notification to the Secretariat of the level of customs duties and charges of any kind referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or Article 29(7), if that is the later.  

(iv) The recording of “other duties or charges” in the Tariff Record is without prejudice to their consistency with rights and obligations under GATT 1994 other than those affected by sub-paragraph (iii) above. All Contracting Parties retain the right to challenge, at any time, the consistency of any “other duty or charge” with such obligations.  

(v) “Other duties or charges” omitted from a notification to the Secretariat shall not subsequently be added to it and any “other duty or charge” recorded at a level lower than that prevailing on the applicable date shall not be restored to that level unless such additions or changes are made within six months of the notification to the Secretariat.    

6. Where the WTO Agreement refers to “duties inscribed in the Schedule” or to “bound duties”, there shall be substituted “the level of customs duties and charges of any kind permitted under Article 29(4) to (8)”.  

7. Where the WTO Agreement specifies the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement (or an analogous phrase) as the reference date for an action, there shall be substituted the date of entry into force of the Amendment to the trade-related provisions of this Treaty adopted by the Charter Conference on 24 April 1998.  

8. With respect to notifications required by the provisions made applicable by Article 29(2)(a): 

a) Contracting Parties which are not members of the WTO shall make their notifications to the Secretariat. The Secretariat shall circulate copies of the notifications to all Contracting Parties. Notifications to the Secretariat shall be in one of the authentic languages of this Treaty. The accompanying documents may be solely in the language of the Contracting Party;  

b) such requirements shall not apply to Contracting Parties to this Treaty which are also members of the WTO which provides for its own notification requirements.    

9. Where Article 29(2)(a) or (6)(b) applies, the Charter Conference shall carry out any applicable duties that the WTO Agreement assigned to the relevant bodies under the WTO Agreement.  

10. 

a) Interpretations of the WTO Agreement adopted by the Ministerial Conference or the General Council of the WTO under paragraph 2 of article IX of the WTO Agreement insofar as they interpret provisions applicable under Article 29(2)(a) shall apply.  

b) Amendments to the WTO Agreement under article X of the WTO Agreement that are binding on all members of the WTO (other then those under paragraph 9 of article X) insofar as they amend or relate to provisions applicable under Article 29(2)(a), shall apply unless a Contracting Party requests the Charter Conference to disapply or modify such amendment. The Charter Conference shall take the decision by a three-fourths majority of the Contracting Parties and determine the date of the disapplication or modification of such amendment. A request for the disapplication or modification of such amendment may include a request that the application of the amendment be suspended pending the decision of the Charter Conference. A request to the Charter Conference made under this paragraph shall be made within six months of the circulation of a notification from the Secretariat that the amendment has taken effect under the WTO Agreement.  

c) Interpretations, amendments, or new instruments adopted by the WTO, other than the interpretations and amendments applied under paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply.      

### 13  Annex TFU  

####Provisions regarding trade agreements between states which were constituent parts of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (In accordance with Article 29(2)b))

### 1  

Any agreement referred to in Article 29 2b) shall be notified in writing to the Secretariat by or on behalf of all of the parties to such agreement which sign or accede to this Treaty: 

a) in respect of an agreement in force as of a date three months after the date on which the first of such parties signs or deposits its instrument of accession to the Treaty, no later than six months after such date of signature or deposit; and  

b) in respect of an agreement which enters into force on a date subsequent to the date referred to in subparagraph a), sufficiently in advance of its entry into force for other states or Regional Economic Integration Organizations which have signed or acceded to the Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the “Interested Parties") to have a reasonable opportunity to review the agreement and make representations concerning it to the parties thereto and to the Charter Conference prior to such entry into force.    

### 2  

The notification shall include: 

a) copies of the original texts of the agreement in all languages in which it has been signed;  

b) a description, by reference to the items included in Annex EM, of the specific Energy Materials and Products to which it applies;  

c) an explanation, separately for each relevant provision of the WTO Agreement made applicable by Article 29(2)a), of the circumstances which make it impossible or impracticable for the parties to the agreement to conform fully with that provision;  

d) the specific measures to be adopted by each party to the agreement to address the circumstances referred to in subparagraph c); and  

e) a description of the parties' programmes for achieving a progressive reduction and ultimate elimination of the agreement's non-conforming provisions.    

### 3  

Parties to an agreement notified in accordance with paragraph 1 shall afford to the Interested Parties a reasonable opportunity to consult with them with respect to such agreement, and shall accord consideration to their representations. Upon the request of any of the Interested Parties, the agreement shall be considered by the Charter Conference, which may adopt recommendations with respect thereto.  

### 4  

The Charter Conference shall periodically review the implementation of agreements notified pursuant to paragraph 1 and the progress having been made towards the elimination of provisions thereof that do not conform with provisions of the WTO Agreement made applicable by Article 29(2)a). Upon the request of any of the Interested Parties, the Charter Conference may adopt recommendations with respect to such an agreement.  

### 5  

An agreement described in Article 29(2)b) may in case of exceptional urgency be allowed to enter into force without the notification and consultation provided for in subparagraph 1b), paragraphs 2 and 3, provided that such notification takes place and the opportunity for such consultation is afforded promptly. In such a case the parties to the agreement shall nevertheless notify its text in accordance with subparagraph 2a) promptly upon its entry into force.  

### 6  

Contracting Parties which are or become parties to an agreement described in Article 29(2)b) undertake to limit the non-conformities thereof with the provisions of the WTO Agreement made applicable by Article 29(2)a) to those necessary to address the particular circumstances and to implement such an agreement so as least to deviate from those provisions. They shall make every effort to take remedial action in light of representations from the Interested Parties and of any recommendations of the Charter Conference.  

### 14  Annex BR

### 15  Annex BRQ  

####List of Contracting Parties which shall not increase any customs duty or other charge above the level resulting from their commitments or any provisions applicable to them under the WTO agreement (In accordance with article 29 (7))

### 16  Annex D  

####Interim provisions for trade dispute settlement (In accordance with Article 29(9))

### 1  

a.  In their relations with one another, Contracting Parties shall make every effort through cooperation and consultations to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any dispute about existing measures that might materially affect compliance with the provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29, or about any measures that might nullify or impair any benefit accruing to a Contracting Party directly or indirectly under the provisions applicable to trade under Article 29.   
b.  A Contracting Party may make a written request to any other Contracting Party for consultations regarding any existing measure of the other Contracting Party that it considers might affect materially compliance with provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29, or any measure that might nullify or impair any benefit accruing to a Contracting Party directly or indirectly under the provisions applicable to trade under Article 29. A Contracting Party which requests consultations shall to the fullest extent possible indicate the measure complained of and specify the provisions of Article 5 or 29 and of the WTO Agreement that it considers relevant. Requests to consult pursuant to this paragraph shall be notified to the Secretariat, which shall periodically inform the Contracting Parties of pending consultations that have been notified.   
c.  A Contracting Party shall treat any confidential or proprietary information identified as such and contained in or received in response to a written request, or received in the course of consultations, in the same manner in which it is treated by the Contracting Party providing the information.   
d.  In seeking to resolve matters considered by a Contracting Party to affect compliance with provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29 as between itself and another Contracting Party, or to nullify or impair any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly under the provisions applicable to trade under Article 29, the Contracting Parties participating in consultations or other dispute settlement shall make every effort to avoid a resolution that adversely affects the trade of any other Contracting Party.   

### 2  

a.  If, within 60 days from the receipt of the request for consultation referred to in subparagraph 1b), the Contracting Parties have not resolved their dispute or agreed to resolve it by conciliation, mediation, arbitration or other method, either Contracting Party may deliver to the Secretariat a written request for the establishment of a panel in accordance with subparagraphs b) to f). In its request the requesting Contracting Party shall state the substance of the dispute and indicate which provisions of Article 5 or 29 and of the WTO Agreement are considered relevant. The Secretariat shall promptly deliver copies of the request to all Contracting Parties.   
b.  The interests of other Contracting Parties shall be taken into account during the resolution of a dispute. Any other Contracting Party having a substantial interest in a matter shall have the right to be heard by the panel and to make written submissions to it, provided that both the disputing Contracting Parties and the Secretariat have received written notice of its interest no later than the date of establishment of the panel, as determined in accordance with subparagraph c).   
c.  A panel shall be deemed to be established 45 days after the receipt of the written request of a Contracting Party by the Secretariat pursuant to subparagraph a).   
d.  A panel shall be composed of three members who shall be chosen by the Secretary-General from the roster described in paragraph 7. Except where the disputing Contracting Parties agree otherwise, the members of a panel shall not be citizens of Contracting Parties which either are party to the dispute or have notified their interest in accordance with subparagraph b), or citizens of states members of a Regional Economic Integration Organization which either is party to the dispute or has notified its interest in accordance with subparagraph b).   
e.  The disputing Contracting Parties shall respond within ten working days to the nominations of panel members and shall not oppose nominations except for compelling reasons.   
f.  Panel members shall serve in their individual capacities and shall neither seek nor take instruction from any government or other body. Each Contracting Party undertakes to respect these principles and not to seek to influence panel members in the performance of their tasks. Panel members shall be selected with a view to ensuring their independence, and that a sufficient diversity of backgrounds and breadth of experience are reflected in a panel.   
g.  The Secretariat shall promptly notify all Contracting Parties that a panel has been constituted.   

### 3  

a.  The Charter Conference shall adopt rules of procedure for panel proceedings consistent with this Annex. Rules of procedure shall be as close as possible to those of the WTO Agreement. A panel shall also have the right to adopt additional rules of procedure not inconsistent with the rules of procedure adopted by the Charter Conference or with this Annex. In a proceeding before a panel each disputing Contracting Party and any other Contracting Party which has notified its interest in accordance with subparagraph 2b), shall have the right to at least one hearing before the panel and to provide a written submission. Disputing Contracting Parties shall also have the right to provide a written rebuttal. A panel may grant a request by any other Contracting Party which has notified its interest in accordance with subparagraph 2b) for access to any written submission made to the panel, with the consent of the Contracting Party which has made it. The proceedings of a panel shall be confidential. A panel shall make an objective assessment of the matters before it, including the facts of the dispute and the compliance of measures with the provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29. In exercising its functions, a panel shall consult with the disputing Contracting Parties and give them adequate opportunity to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Contracting Parties, a panel shall base its decision on the arguments and submissions of the disputing Contracting Parties. Panels shall be guided by the interpretations given to the WTO Agreement within the framework of the WTO Agreement and shall not question the compatibility with Article 5 or 29 of practices applied by any Contracting Party which is a member of the WTO to other members of the WTO to which it applies the WTO Agreement and which have not been taken by those other members to dispute resolution under the WTO Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Contracting Parties, all procedures involving a panel, including the issuance of its final report, should be completed within 180 days of the date of establishment of the panel; however, a failure to complete all procedures within this period shall not affect the validity of a final report.   
b.  A panel shall determine its jurisdiction; such determination shall be final and binding. Any objection by a disputing Contracting Party that a dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the panel shall be considered by the panel, which shall decide whether to deal with the objection as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.   
c.  In the event of two or more requests for establishment of a panel in relation to disputes that are substantively similar, the Secretary-General may with the consent of all the disputing Contracting Parties appoint a single panel.   

### 4  

a.  After having considered rebuttal arguments, a panel shall submit to the disputing Contracting Parties the descriptive sections of its draft written report, including a statement of the facts and a summary of the arguments made by the disputing Contracting Parties. The disputing Contracting Parties shall be afforded an opportunity to submit written comments on the descriptive sections within a period set by the panel. Following the date set for receipt of comments from the Contracting Parties, the panel shall issue to the disputing Contracting Parties an interim written report, including both the descriptive sections and the panel's proposed findings and conclusions. Within a period set by the panel a disputing Contracting Party may submit to the panel a written request that the panel review specific aspects of the interim report before issuing a final report. Before issuing a final report the panel may, in its discretion, meet with the disputing Contracting Parties to consider the issues raised in such a request. The final report shall include descriptive sections (including a statement of the facts and a summary of the arguments made by the disputing Contracting Parties), the panel's findings and conclusions, and a discussion of arguments made on specific aspects of the interim report at the stage of its review. The final report shall deal with every substantial issue raised before the panel and necessary to the resolution of the dispute and shall state the reasons for the panel's conclusions. A panel shall issue its final report by providing it promptly to the Secretariat and to the disputing Contracting Parties. The Secretariat shall at the earliest practicable opportunity distribute the final report, together with any written views that a disputing Contracting Party desires to have appended, to all Contracting Parties.   
b.  Where a panel concludes that a measure introduced or maintained by a Contracting Party does not comply with a provision of Article 5 or 29 or with a provision of the WTO Agreement that applies under Article 29, the panel may recommend in its final report that the Contracting Party alter or abandon the measure or conduct so as to be in compliance with that provision.   
c.  Panel reports shall be adopted by the Charter Conference. In order to provide sufficient time for the Charter Conference to consider panel reports, a report shall not be adopted by the Charter Conference until at least 30 days after it has been provided to all Contracting Parties by the Secretariat. Contracting Parties having objections to a panel report shall give written reasons for their objections to the Secretariat at least 10 days prior to the date on which the report is to be considered for adoption by the Charter Conference, and the Secretariat shall promptly provide them to all Contracting Parties. The disputing Contracting Parties and Contracting Parties which notified their interest in accordance with subparagraph 2b) shall have the right to participate fully in the consideration of the panel report on that dispute by the Charter Conference, and their views shall be fully recorded.   
d.  In order to ensure effective resolution of disputes to the benefit of all Contracting Parties, prompt compliance with rulings and recommendations of a final panel report that has been adopted by the Charter Conference is essential. A Contracting Party which is subject to a ruling or recommendation of a final panel report that has been adopted by the Charter Conference shall inform the Charter Conference of its intentions regarding compliance with such ruling or recommendation. In the event that immediate compliance is impracticable, the Contracting Party concerned shall explain its reasons for non-compliance to the Charter Conference and, in light of this explanation, shall have a reasonable period of time to effect compliance. The aim of dispute resolution is the modification or removal of inconsistent measures.   

### 5  

a.  Where a Contracting Party has failed within a reasonable period of time to comply with a ruling or recommendation of a final panel report that has been adopted by the Charter Conference, a Contracting Party to the dispute injured by such non-compliance may deliver to the non-complying Contracting Party a written request that the non-complying Contracting Party enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing upon mutually acceptable compensation. If so requested the non-complying Contracting Party shall promptly enter into such negotiations.   
b.  If the non-complying Contracting Party refuses to negotiate, or if the Contracting Parties have not reached agreement within 30 days after delivery of the request for negotiations, the injured Contracting Party may make a written request for authorization of the Charter Conference to suspend obligations owed by it to the non-complying Contracting Party under Article 5 or 29.   
c.  The Charter Conference may authorize the injured Contracting Party to suspend such of its obligations to the non-complying Contracting Party, under provisions of Article 5 or 29 or under provisions of the WTO Agreement that apply under Article 29, as the injured Contracting Party considers equivalent in the circumstances.   
d.  The suspension of obligations shall be temporary and shall be applied only until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with Article 5 or 29 has been removed, or until a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.   

### 6  

a.  Before suspending such obligations the injured Contracting Party shall inform the non-complying Contracting Party of the nature and level of its proposed suspension. If the non-complying Contracting Party delivers to the Secretary-General a written objection to the level of suspension of obligations proposed by the injured Contracting Party, the objection shall be referred to arbitration as provided below. The proposed suspension of obligations shall be stayed until the arbitration has been completed and the determination of the arbitral panel has become final and binding in accordance with subparagraph e).   
b.  The Secretary-General shall establish an arbitral panel in accordance with subparagraphs 2d) to f), which if practicable shall be the same panel which made the ruling or recommendation referred to in subparagraph 4d), to examine the level of obligations that the injured Contracting Party proposes to suspend. Unless the Charter Conference decides otherwise the rules of procedure for panel proceedings shall be adopted in accordance with subparagraph 3a).   
c.  The arbitral panel shall determine whether the level of obligations proposed to be suspended by the injured Contracting Party is excessive in relation to the injury it experienced, and if so, to what extent. It shall not review the nature of the obligations suspended, except insofar as this is inseparable from the determination of the level of suspended obligations.   
d.  The arbitral panel shall deliver its written determination to the injured and the non-complying Contracting Parties and to the Secretariat within 60 days of the establishment of the panel or within such other period as may be agreed by the injured and the non-complying Contracting Parties. The Secretariat shall present the determination to the Charter Conference at the earliest practicable opportunity, and no later than the meeting of the Charter Conference following receipt of the determination.   
e.  The determination of the arbitral panel shall become final and binding 30 days after the date of its presentation to the Charter Conference, and any level of suspension of benefits allowed thereby may thereupon be put into effect by the injured Contracting Party in such manner as that Contracting Party considers equivalent in the circumstances, unless prior to the expiration of the 30 days period the Charter Conference decides otherwise.   
f.  In suspending any obligations to a non-complying Contracting Party, an injured Contracting Party shall make every effort not to affect adversely the trade of any other Contracting Party.   

### 7  

Each Contracting Party may designate two individuals who shall, in the case of Contracting Parties which are also member of the WTO, if they are willing and able to serve as panellists under this Annex, be persons whose names appear on the indicative list of governmental and non-governmental individuals, referred to in article 8 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes contained in Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement or who have in the past served as panellists on a GATT or WTO dispute settlement panel. The Secretary-General may also designate, with the approval of the Charter Conference, not more than ten individuals, who are willing and able to serve as panellists for purposes of dispute resolution in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4. The Charter Conference may in addition decide to designate for the same purposes up to 20 individuals, who serve on dispute settlement rosters of other international bodies, who are willing and able to serve as panellists. The names of all of the individuals so designated shall constitute the dispute settlement roster. Individuals shall be designated strictly on the basis of objectivity, reliability and sound judgement and, to the greatest extent possible, shall have expertise in international trade and energy matters, in particular as relates to provisions applicable under Article 29. In fulfilling any function under this Annex, designees shall not be affiliated with or take instructions from any Contracting Party.

####Final act of the European Energy Charter Conference

I. The final Plenary Session of the European Energy Charter Conference was held at Lisbon on 16–17 December 1994. Representatives of the Republic of Albania, the Republic of Armenia, Australia, the Republic of Austria, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Bulgaria, Canada, the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Estonia, the European Communities, the Republic of Finland, the French Republic, the Republic of Georgia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Iceland, Ireland, the Italian Republic, Japan, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Latvia, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Moldova, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Slovenia, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation, the Republic of Tajikistan, the Republic of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the Republic of Uzbekistan (hereinafter referred to as “the representatives") participated in the Conference, as did invited observers from certain countries and international organizations. 
###Background

II. During the meeting of the European Council in Dublin in June 1990, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands suggested that economic recovery in Eastern Europe and the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could be catalysed and accelerated by cooperation in the energy sector. This suggestion was welcomed by the Council, which invited the Commission of the European Communities to study how best to implement such cooperation. In February 1991 the Commission proposed the concept of a European Energy Charter. Following discussion of the Commission's proposal in the Council of the European Communities, the European Communities invited the other countries of Western and Eastern Europe, of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the non-European members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to attend a conference in Brussels in July 1991 to launch negotiations on the European Energy Charter. A number of other countries and international organizations were invited to attend the European Energy Charter Conference as observers. Negotiations on the European Energy Charter were completed in 1991 and the Charter was adopted by signature of a Concluding Document at a conference held at The Hague on 16-17 December 1991. Signatories of the Charter, then or subsequently, include all those listed in Section I above, other than observers. The signatories of the European Energy Charter undertook: 

– to pursue the objectives and principles of the Charter and implement and broaden their cooperation as soon as possible by negotiating in good faith a Basic Agreement and Protocols.   The European Energy Charter Conference accordingly began negotiations on a Basic Agreement – later called the Energy Charter Treaty – designed to promote East-West industrial cooperation by providing legal safeguards in areas such as investment, transit and trade. It also began negotiations on Protocols in the fields of energy efficiency, nuclear safety and hydrocarbons, although in the last case negotiations were later suspended until completion of the Energy Charter Treaty. Negotiations on the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental Aspects were successfully completed in 1994. 
###The Energy Charter Treaty

III. As a result of its deliberations the European Energy Charter Conference has adopted the text of the Energy Charter Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the “Treaty") which is set out in Annex 1 and Decisions with respect thereto which are set out in Annex 2, and agreed that the Treaty would be open for signature at Lisbon from 17 December 1994 to 16 June 1995. 
###Understandings

IV. By signing the Final Act, the representatives agreed to adopt the following Understandings with respect to the Treaty:  

### 1  

#### *With respect to the Treaty as a whole* 

a.  The representatives underline that the provisions of the Treaty have been agreed upon bearing in mind the specific nature of the Treaty aiming at a legal framework to promote long-term cooperation in a particular sector and as a result cannot be construed to constitute a precedent in the context of other international negotiations.   
b.  The provisions of the Treaty do not: 

(i) oblige any Contracting Party to introduce mandatory third party access; or  

(ii) prevent the use of pricing systems which, within a particular category of consumers, apply identical prices to customers in different locations.     
c.  Derogations from most favoured nation treatment are not intended to cover measures which are specific to an Investor or group of Investors, rather than applying generally.   

### 2  

#### *With respect to Article 1(5)* 

a.  It is understood that the Treaty confers no rights to engage in economic activities other than Economic Activities in the Energy Sector.   
b.  The following activities are illustrative of Economic Activity in the Energy Sector: 

(i) prospecting and exploration for, and extraction of, e.g., oil, gas, coal and uranium;  

(ii) construction and operation of power generation facilities, including those powered by wind and other renewable energy sources;  

(iii) land transportation, distribution, storage and supply of Energy Materials and Products, e.g., by way of transmission and distribution grids and pipelines or dedicated rail lines, and construction of facilities for such, including the laying of oil, gas, and coal-slurry pipelines;  

(iv) removal and disposal of wastes from energy related facilities such as power stations, including radioactive wastes from nuclear power stations;  

(v) decommissioning of energy related facilities, including oil rigs, oil refineries and power generating plants;  

(vi) marketing and sale of, and trade in Energy Materials and Products, e.g., retail sales of gasoline; and  

(vii) research, consulting, planning, management and design activities related to the activities mentioned above, including those aimed at Improving Energy Efficiency.     

### 3  

#### *With respect to Article 1(6)* 

For greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of any other Contracting Party, control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be considered, including the Investor's 

a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment;  

b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment; and  

c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.   Where there is doubt as to whether an Investor controls, directly or indirectly, an Investment, an Investor claiming such control has the burden of proof that such control exists.  

### 4  

#### *With respect to Article 1(8)* 

Consistent with Australia's foreign investment policy, the establishment of a new mining or raw materials processing project in Australia with total investment of $A 10 million or more by a foreign interest, even where that foreign interest is already operating a similar business in Australia, is considered as the making of a new investment.  

### 5  

#### *With respect to Article 1(12)* 

The representatives recognize the necessity for adequate and effective protection of Intellectual Property rights according to the highest internationally-accepted standards.  

### 6  

#### *With respect to Article 5(1)* 

The representatives' agreement to Article 5 is not meant to imply any position on whether or to what extent the provisions of the “Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures" annexed to the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations are implicit in articles III and XI of the GATT.  

### 7  

#### *With respect to Article 6* 

a.  The unilateral and concerted anti-competitive conduct referred to in Article 6(2) are to be defined by each Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and may include exploitative abuses.   
b.  “Enforcement" and “enforces" include action under the competition laws of a Contracting Party by way of investigation, legal proceeding, or administrative action as well as by way of any decision or further law granting or continuing an authorization.   

### 8  

#### *With respect to Article 7(4)* 

The applicable legislation would include provisions on environmental protection, land use, safety, or technical standards.  

### 9  

#### *With respect to Articles 9, 10 and Part V* 

As a Contracting Party's programmes which provide for public loans, grants, guarantees or insurance for facilitating trade or Investment abroad are not connected with Investment or related activities of Investors from other Contracting Parties in its Area, such programmes may be subject to constraints with respect to participation in them.  

### 10  

#### *With respect to Article 10(4)* 

The supplementary treaty will specify conditions for applying the Treatment described in Article 10(3). Those conditions will include, inter alia, provisions relating to the sale or other divestment of state assets (privatization) and to the dismantling of monopolies (demonopolization).  

### 11  

#### *With respect to Articles 10(4) and 29(6)* 

Contracting Parties may consider any connection between the provisions of Article 10(4) and Article 29(6).  

### 12  

#### *With respect to Article 14(5* 

It is intended that a Contracting Party which enters into an agreement referred to in Article 14(5) ensure that the conditions of such an agreement are not in contradiction with that Contracting Party's obligations under the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.  

### 13  

#### *With respect to Article 19(1) i)* 

It is for each Contracting Party to decide the extent to which the assessment and monitoring of Environmental Impacts should be subject to legal requirements, the authorities competent to take decisions in relation to such requirements, and the appropriate procedures to be followed.  

### 14  

#### *With respect to Articles 22 and 23* 

With regard to trade in Energy Materials and Products governed by Article 29, that Article specifies the provisions relevant to the subjects covered by Articles 22 and 23.  

### 15  

#### *With respect to Article 24* 

Exceptions contained in the GATT and Related Instruments apply between particular Contracting Parties which are parties to the GATT, as recognized by Article 4. With respect to trade in Energy Materials and Products governed by Article 29, that Article specifies the provisions relevant to the subjects covered by Article 24.  

### 16  

#### *With respect to Article 26(2)a)* 

Article 26(2) a) should not be interpreted to require a Contracting Party to enact Part III of the Treaty into its domestic law.  

### 17  

#### *With respect to Articles 26 and 27* 

The reference to treaty obligations in the penultimate sentence of Article 10(1) does not include decisions taken by international organizations, even if they are legally binding, or treaties which entered into force before 1 January 1970.  

### 18  

#### *With respect to Article 29(2)a)* 

a.  Where a provision of GATT 1947 or a Related Instrument referred to in this paragraph provides for joint action by parties to the GATT, it is intended that the Charter Conference take such action.   
b.  The notion “applied on 1 March 1994 and practised with regard to Energy Materials and Products by parties to GATT 1947 among themselves" is not intended to refer to cases where a party to the GATT has invoked article XXXV of the GATT, thereby disapplying the GATT vis-à-vis another party to the GATT, but nevertheless applies unilaterally on a de facto basis some provisions of the GATT vis-à-vis that other party to the GATT.   

### 19  

#### *With respect to Article 33* 

The provisional Charter Conference should at the earliest possible date decide how best to give effect to the goal of Title III of the European Energy Charter that Protocols be negotiated in areas of cooperation such as those listed in Title III of the Charter.  

### 20  

#### *With respect to Article 34* 

a.  The provisional Secretary-General should make immediate contact with other international bodies in order to discover the terms on which they might be willing to undertake tasks arising from the Treaty and the Charter. The provisional Secretary-General might report back to the provisional Charter Conference at the meeting which Article 45(4) requires to be convened not later than 180 days after the opening date for signature of the Treaty.   
b.  The Charter Conference should adopt the annual budget before the beginning of the financial year.   

### 21  

#### *With respect to Article 34(3)m)* 

The technical changes to Annexes might for instance include, delisting of non-signatories or of signatories that have evinced their intention not to ratify, or additions to Annexes N and VC. It is intended that the Secretariat would propose such changes to the Charter Conference when appropriate.  

### 22  

#### *With respect to Annex TFU(1)* 

a.  If some of the parties to an agreement referred to in paragraph 1 have not signed or acceded to the Treaty at the time required for notification, those parties to the agreement which have signed or acceded to the Treaty may notify on their behalf.   
b.  The need in general for notification of agreements of a purely commercial nature is not foreseen because such agreements should not raise a question of compliance with Article 29(2)a), even when they are entered into by state agencies. The Charter Conference could, however, clarify for purposes of Annex TFU which types of agreements referred to in Article 29(2)b) require notification under the Annex and which types do not.   

###Declarations

V. The representatives declared that Article 18(2) shall not be construed to allow the circumvention of the application of the other provisions of the Treaty. VI. The representatives also noted the following Declarations that were made with respect to the Treaty: 

1.  *With respect to Article 1(6)*  The Russian Federation wishes to have reconsidered, in negotiations with regard to the supplementary treaty referred to in Article 10(4), the question of the importance of national legislation with respect to the issue of control as expressed in the Understanding to Article 1(6).  

2. ) *With respect to Articles 5 and 10(11)* Australia notes that the provisions of Articles 5 and 10(11) do not diminish its rights and obligations under the GATT, including as elaborated in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, particularly with respect to the list of exceptions in Article 5(3), which it considers incomplete. Australia further notes that it would not be appropriate for dispute settlement bodies established under the Treaty to give interpretations of GATT articles III and XI in the context of disputes between parties to the GATT or between an Investor of a party to the GATT and another party to the GATT. It considers that with respect to the application of Article 10(11) between an Investor and a party to the GATT, the only issue that can be considered under Article 26 is the issue of the awards of arbitration in the event that a GATT panel or the WTO dispute settlement body first establishes that a trade-related investment measure maintained by the Contracting Party is inconsistent with its obligations under the GATT or the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures.  

3.  *With respect to Article 7*  The European Communities and their Member States and Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland declare that the provisions of Article 7 are subject to the conventional rules of international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines or, where there are no such rules, to general international law. They further declare that Article 7 is not intended to affect the interpretation of existing international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines, and cannot be considered as doing so.  

4.  *With respect to Article 10*  Canada and the United States each affirm that they will apply the provisions of Article 10 in accordance with the following considerations: For the purposes of assessing the treatment which must be accorded to Investors of other Contracting Parties and their Investments, the circumstances will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. A comparison between the treatment accorded to Investors of one Contracting Party, or the Investments of Investors of one Contracting Party, and the Investments or Investors of another Contracting Party, is only valid if it is made between Investors and Investments in similar circumstances. In determining whether differential treatment of Investors or Investments is consistent with Article 10, two basic factors must be taken into account. The first factor is the policy objectives of Contracting Parties in various fields insofar as they are consistent with the principles of non-discrimination set out in Article 10. Legitimate policy objectives may justify differential treatment of foreign Investors or their Investments in order to reflect a dissimilarity of relevant circumstances between those Investors and Investments and their domestic counterparts. For example, the objective of ensuring the integrity of a country's financial system would justify reasonable prudential measures with respect to foreign Investors or Investments, where such measures would be unnecessary to ensure the attainment of the same objectives insofar as domestic Investors or Investments are concerned. Those foreign Investors or their Investments would thus not be “in similar circumstances" to domestic Investors or their Investments. Thus, even if such a measure accorded differential treatment, it would not be contrary to Article 10. The second factor is the extent to which the measure is motivated by the fact that the relevant Investor or Investment is subject to foreign ownership or under foreign control. A measure aimed specifically at Investors because they are foreign, without sufficient countervailing policy reasons consistent with the preceding paragraph, would be contrary to the principles of Article 10. The foreign Investor or Investment would be “in similar circumstances" to domestic Investors and their Investments, and the measure would be contrary to Article 10.  

5.  *With respect to Article 25*  The European Communities and their Member States recall that, in accordance with article 58 of the Treaty establishing the European Community: 

a) companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community shall, for the right of establishment pursuant to Part Three, Title III, Chapter 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States; companies or firms which only have their registered office within the Community must, for this purpose, have an effective and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States;  

b) “companies and firms" means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profitmaking.   The European Communities and their Member States further recall that: Community law provides for the possibility to extend the treatment described above to branches and agencies of companies or firms not established in one of the Member States; and that, the application of Article 25 of the Energy Charter Treaty will allow only those derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential treatment resulting from the wider process of economic integration resulting from the Treaties establishing the European Communities.  

6.  *With respect to Article 40*  Denmark recalls that the European Energy Charter does not apply to Greenland and the Faroe Islands until notice to this effect has been received from the local governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. In this respect Denmark affirms that Article 40 of the Treaty applies to Greenland and the Faroe Islands.  

7.  *With respect to Annex G(4)*  

a) The European Communities and the Russian Federation declare that trade in nuclear materials between them shall be governed, until they reach another agreement, by the provisions of article 22 of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Russian Federation, of the other part, signed at Corfu on 24 June 1994, the exchange of letters attached thereto and the related joint declaration, and disputes regarding such trade will be subject to the procedures of the said Agreement.  

b) The European Communities and Ukraine declare that, in accordance with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed at Luxembourg on 14 June 1994 and the Interim Agreement thereto, initialled there the same day, trade in nuclear materials between them shall be exclusively governed by the provisions of a specific agreement to be concluded between the European Atomic Energy Community and Ukraine. Until entry into force of this specific agreement, the provisions of the Agreement on Trade and Economic and Commercial Cooperation between the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed at Brussels on 18 December 1989 shall exclusively continue to apply for trade in nuclear materials between them.  

c) The European Communities and Kazakhstan declare that, in accordance with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement initialled at Brussels on 20 May 1994, trade in nuclear materials between them shall be exclusively governed by the provisions of a specific agreement to be concluded between the European Atomic Energy Community and Kazakhstan. Until entry into force of this specific agreement, the provisions of the Agreement on Trade and Economic and Commercial Cooperation between the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed at Brussels on 18 December 1989 shall exclusively continue to apply for trade in nuclear materials between them.  

d) The European Communities and Kyrgyzstan declare that, in accordance with the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation initialled at Brussels on 31 May 1994, trade in nuclear materials between them shall be exclusively governed by the provisions of a specific agreement to be concluded between the European Atomic Energy Community and Kyrgyzstan. Until entry into force of this specific agreement, the provisions of the Agreement on Trade and Economic and Commercial Cooperation between the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed at Brussels on 18 December 1989 shall exclusively continue to apply for trade in nuclear materials between them.  

e) The European Communities and Tajikistan declare that trade in nuclear materials between them shall be exclusively governed by the provisions of a specific agreement to be concluded between the European Atomic Energy Community and Tajikistan. Until entry into force of this specific agreement, the provisions of the Agreement on Trade and Economic and Commercial Cooperation between the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed at Brussels on 18 December 1989 shall exclusively continue to apply for trade in nuclear materials between them.

– promotion of an energy mix designed to minimise negative environmental consequences in a cost-effective way through: 

(i) market-oriented energy prices which more fully reflect environmental costs and benefits;  

(ii) efficient and co-ordinated policy measures related to energy;  

(iii) use of new and renewable energies and clean technologies;    

– achieving and maintaining a high level of nuclear safety and ensuring effective co-operation in this field.      

### Title  II  

####IMPLEMENTATION

In order to attain the objectives set out above, the signatories will, within the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy resources, take co-ordinated action to achieve greater coherence of energy policies, which should be based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented price formation, taking due account of environmental concerns. They underline that practical steps to define energy policies are necessary in order to intensify co-operation in this sector and further stress the importance of regular exchanges of views on action taken, taking full advantage of the experience of existing international organizations and institutions in this field. The signatories recognize that commercial forms of co-operation may need to be complemented by intergovernmental co-operation, particularly in the area of energy policy formulation and analysis as well as in areas which are essential and not suitable to private capital funding. They undertake to pursue the objectives of creating a broader European energy market and enhancing the efficient functioning of the global energy market by joint or co-ordinated action under the Charter in the following fields: 

– access to and development of energy resources;  

– access to markets;  

– liberalization of trade in energy;  

– promotion and protection of investments;  

– safety principles and guidelines;  

– research, technological development, innovation and dissemination;  

– energy efficiency and environmental protection;  

– education and training.   In implementing this joint or co-ordinated action, they undertake to foster private initiative, to make full use of the potential of enterprises, institutions and all available financial sources, and to facilitate co-operation between such enterprises or institutions from different countries, acting on the basis of market principles. The signatories will ensure that the international rules on the protection of industrial, commercial and intellectual property are respected. 

1. Access to and development of energy resources Considering that efficient development of energy resources is a sine qua non for attaining the objectives of the Charter, the signatories undertake to facilitate access to and development of resources by the interested operators. To this end, they will ensure that rules on the exploration, development and acquisition of resources are publicly available and transparent; they recognize the need to formulate such rules wherever this has not yet been done and to take all necessary measures to co-ordinate their actions in this area. With a view to facilitating the development and diversification of resources, the signatories undertake to avoid imposing discriminatory rules on operators, notably rules governing the ownership of resources, internal operation of companies and taxation.  

2. Access to Markets The signatories will strongly promote access to local and international markets for energy products for the implementation of the objectives of the Charter. Such access to markets should take account of the need to facilitate the operation of market forces, and promote competition.  

3. Liberalization of trade in energy In order to develop and diversify trade in energy, the signatories undertake progressively to remove the barriers to such trade with each other in energy products, equipment and services in a manner consistent with the provisions of GATT, its related instruments, and nuclear non-proliferation obligations and undertakings. The signatories recognize that transit of energy products through their territories is essential for the liberalization of trade in energy products. Transit should take place in economic and environmentally sound conditions. They stress the importance of the development of commercial international energy transmission networks and their interconnection, with particular reference to electricity and natural gas and with recognition of the relevance of long-term commercial commitments. To this end, they will ensure the compatibility of technical specifications governing the installation and operation of such networks, notably as regards the stability of electricity systems.  

4. Promotion and protection of investments In order to promote the international flow of investments, the signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent legal framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant international laws and rules on investment and trade. They affirm that it is important for the signatory States to negotiate and ratify legally binding agreements on promotion and protection of investments which ensure a high level of legal security and enable the use of investment risk guarantee schemes. Moreover, the signatories will guarantee the right to repatriate profits or other payments relating to an investment and to obtain or use the convertible currency needed. They also recognize the importance of the avoidance of double taxation to foster private investment.  

5. Safety principles and guidelines Consistent with relevant major multilateral agreements, the signatories will: 

– implement safety principles and guidelines, designed to achieve and/or maintain high levels of safety, in particular nuclear safety and the protection of health and the environment;  

– develop such common safety principles and guidelines as are appropriate and/or agree to the mutual recognition of their safety principles and guidelines.    

6. Research, technological development, innovation and dissemination The signatories undertake to promote exchanges of technology and co-operation on their technological development and innovation activities in the fields of energy production, conversion, transport, distribution and the efficient and clean use of energy, in a manner consistent with nuclear non-proliferation obligations and undertakings. To this end, they will encourage co-operative efforts on: 

– research and development activities;  

– pilot or demonstration projects;  

– the application of technological innovations;

a. een bedrijf produkten van binnenlandse oorsprong of herkomst moet kopen of gebruiken, ongeacht of dit voorschrift geldt voor specifieke produkten, een bepaalde hoeveelheid van of een bepaalde waarde aan produkten, dan wel voor een bepaald deel van de omvang of waarde van zijn lokale produktie; of  

b. de aankoop of het gebruik van geïmporteerde produkten door een bedrijf moet worden beperkt tot een hoeveelheid die in een bepaalde verhouding staat tot de hoeveelheid of de waarde van de lokale produkten die het bedrijf uitvoert; of die een beperking oplegt aan:  

c. de invoer door een bedrijf van produkten die gebruikt worden bij of verband houden met de lokale produktie van dat bedrijf, in het algemeen, dan wel voor een hoeveelheid die in een bepaalde verhouding staat tot de omvang of de waarde van de lokale produktie die het bedrijf uitvoert;  

d. de invoer door een bedrijf van produkten die gebruikt worden bij of verband houden met de lokale produktie van dat bedrijf, welke beperking erin bestaat dat het bedrijf slechts toegang krijgt tot een bedrag aan deviezen dat in verhouding staat tot de aan het bedrijf toe te schrijven inbreng van deviezen; of  

e. de uitvoer of verkoop voor uitvoer van produkten door een bedrijf, ongeacht of deze beperking geldt voor specifieke produkten, voor een bepaalde hoeveelheid van of waarde aan produkten, dan wel voor een bepaald deel van de omvang of de waarde van zijn lokale produktie.     
3.  Geen enkele bepaling van het eerste lid mag worden uitgelegd als een beletsel voor een Verdragsluitende Partij om de in het tweede lid, letters a) en c), bedoelde met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregelen toe te passen als voorwaarde om in aanmerking te komen voor exportbevordering, buitenlandse hulp, overheidsopdrachten of programma's die voorzien in preferentiële tarieven of quota.   
4.  Ongeacht het eerste lid kan een Verdragsluitende Partij tijdelijk met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregelen handhaven die bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag door die Partij reeds meer dan 180 dagen van toepassing waren, zulks onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen inzake kennisgeving en uitfasering die zijn opgenomen in bijlage TRM.   

### Artikel  6  

####Mededinging

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij streeft naar vermindering van marktverstoringen en belemmeringen van de mededinging bij economische activiteit in de energiesector.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij zorgt ervoor dat zij binnen haar rechtsmacht de nodige en geschikte wetgeving ter bestrijding van unilaterale en overeengekomen mededingingbeperkende gedragingen bij economische activiteit in de energiesector tot stand brengt en doet naleven.   
3.  Verdragsluitende Partijen die ervaring hebben met het toepassen van de mededingingsregels dienen ernstig in overweging te nemen om desgevraagd en binnen de grenzen van de beschikbare middelen technische bijstand voor de ontwikkeling en toepassing van mededingingsregels te verlenen aan andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen bij de handhaving van hun mededingingsregels samenwerken door middel van onderling overleg en uitwisseling van informatie.   
5.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij van oordeel is dat een bepaalde mededingingbeperkende gedraging binnen het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een nadelige invloed heeft op een aanzienlijk belang ten aanzien van de in dit artikel aangegeven doeleinden, kan die Verdragsluitende Partij de andere Verdragsluitende Partij daarvan in kennis stellen en verzoeken dat de mededingingsautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij passende handhavingsmaatregelen treffen. Bij die kennisgeving verstrekt deze Verdragsluitende Partij voldoende informatie, opdat de andere Verdragsluitende Partij kan vaststellen op welke mededinging beperkende gedragingen de kennisgeving betrekking heeft, en biedt zij aan alle verdere informatie te geven en alle verdere medewerking te verlenen die binnen haar vermogen ligt. De Verdragsluitende Partij die een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen of, naar gelang van het geval, de betrokken mededingingsautoriteit(en) kan (kunnen) overleg plegen met de mededingingsautoriteiten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, neemt (nemen) het verzoek van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij ernstig in overweging bij hun besluit al dan niet handhavingsmaatregelen te nemen ten aanzien van de in de kennisgeving genoemde mededingingbeperkende gedraging. De Verdragsluitende Partij die een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen informeert de andere Verdragsluitende Partij over haar besluit of het besluit van de betrokken mededingingsautoriteiten en kan indien zij dit wenst de andere Verdragsluitende Partij informeren over de beweegredenen voor het besluit. Indien handhavingsmaatregelen worden genomen, doet de Verdragsluitende Partij die een kennisgeving heeft ontvangen mededeling aan de andere Verdragsluitende Partij van het resultaat daarvan en, voor zover mogelijk, van significante ontwikkelingen die zich inmiddels hebben voorgedaan.   
6.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel vereist dat een Verdragsluitende Partij informatie moet verstrekken in strijd met haar wetten betreffende openbaarmaking van informatie, vertrouwelijkheid en bedrijfsgeheimen.   
7.  De in het vijfde lid en artikel 27, eerste lid, beschreven procedures zijn binnen dit Verdrag de enige wijze waarop mogelijke geschillen betreffende de uitvoering of interpretatie van dit artikel kunnen worden geregeld.   

### Artikel  7  

####Doorvoer

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij neemt de nodige maatregelen ter vergemakkelijking van de doorvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten overeenkomstig het beginsel van vrije doorvoer en zonder onderscheid te maken naar oorsprong, bestemming of eigendom van die energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, zonder prijsdiscriminatie op grond van een dergelijk onderscheid en zonder onredelijke vertragingen, beperkingen of heffingen op te leggen.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen moedigen de bevoegde diensten ertoe aan om mee te werken aan: 

a. de modernisering van de energietransportvoorzieningen die noodzakelijk zijn voor de doorvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten;  

b. de ontwikkeling en exploitatie van energietransportvoorzieningen die het grondgebied van meer dan een Verdragsluitende Partij bestrijken;  

c. maatregelen om de gevolgen van onderbrekingen van de voorziening met energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten te ondervangen;  

d. het vergemakkelijken van de onderlinge verbinding van energietransportvoorzieningen.     
3.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij verbindt zich ertoe dat, wat betreft energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten in doorvoer, haar bepalingen inzake het vervoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten en het gebruik van energietransportvoorzieningen niet ongunstiger zijn dan voor dergelijke grondstoffen en produkten afkomstig van of bestemd voor haar eigen grondgebied, tenzij in een bestaande internationale overeenkomst anders is bepaald.   
4.  Ingeval doorvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten via energietransportvoorzieningen niet op commerciële voorwaarden kan geschieden, werpen de Verdragsluitende Partijen geen belemmeringen op voor het creëren van nieuwe capaciteit, tenzij in de vigerende wetgeving die niet in strijd is met het eerste lid anders is bepaald.   
5.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij over wier grondgebied doorvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten kan plaatsvinden is niet verplicht: 

a. toestemming te geven voor de aanleg of aanpassing van energietransportvoorzieningen; of  

b. toestemming te geven voor nieuwe of bijkomende doorvoerstromen via bestaande energietransportvoorzieningen,   waarvan zij tegenover de andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen kan aantonen dat daardoor de veiligheid of de doeltreffendheid van haar energiesystemen, inclusief de zekerheid van de voorziening, in gevaar zouden worden gebracht. Behoudens het bepaalde in het zesde en het zevende lid garanderen de Verdragsluitende Partijen de bestaande stromen van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten naar, van of tussen het grondgebied van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
6.  In geval van een geschil over een aangelegenheid in verband met de doorvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten over het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij mag die Verdragsluitende Partij, vóór de afsluiting van de in het zevende lid bedoelde procedures voor het beslechten van geschillen, de bestaande stroom van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten niet onderbreken of verminderen, toelaten dat een lichaam onder haar zeggenschap dat doet, dan wel van een lichaam onder haar rechtsmacht eisen dat dit de bestaande stroom van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten onderbreekt of vermindert, tenzij zulks uitdrukkelijk is vermeld in een contract of een andere overeenkomst over deze doorvoer of is toegestaan bij een besluit van de bemiddelaar.   
7.  De volgende bepalingen zijn van toepassing op een geschil als bedoeld in het zesde lid, zij het pas nadat alle contractuele of andere te voren overeengekomen middelen voor het beslechten van geschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil of tussen een in het zesde lid bedoeld lichaam en een lichaam van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, zijn uitgeput. 

a. Een Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil kan dit voorleggen aan de Secretaris-Generaal door middel van een kennisgeving waarin de aangelegenheden waarop het geschil betrekking heeft worden samengevat. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt alle Verdragsluitende Partijen hiervan in kennis.  

b. De Secretaris-Generaal wijst binnen dertig dagen na ontvangst van de kennisgeving in overleg met de partijen bij het geschil en de andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen een bemiddelaar aan. De bemiddelaar moet ervaring hebben met de aangelegenheden waarop het geschil betrekking heeft en mag geen onderdaan, staatsburger of ingezetene zijn van een partij bij het geschil of een van de andere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

c. De bemiddelaar streeft ernaar dat de partijen bij het geschil akkoord gaan met een oplossing ervan of met een procedure om een dergelijke oplossing te bereiken. Indien hij niet binnen negentig dagen na te zijn aangewezen een dergelijk akkoord heeft bewerkstelligd, doet hij een aanbeveling voor een oplossing van het geschil of een procedure om een dergelijke oplossing te bereiken, en neemt hij een besluit over de voorlopige tarieven en andere voorwaarden die voor de doorvoer in acht moeten worden genomen vanaf een datum die hij aangeeft totdat het geschil is opgelost.  

d. De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe erop toe te zien en ervoor te zorgen dat de lichamen onder hun zeggenschap of rechtsmacht een voorlopig besluit krachtens het zevende lid, letter c), inzake tarieven en voorwaarden in acht nemen gedurende twaalf maanden na het besluit van de bemiddelaar of totdat het geschil is opgelost, welke van beide tijdstippen eerder valt.  

e. Ongeacht letter b) kan de Secretaris-Generaal ervan afzien een bemiddelaar aan te wijzen indien naar zijn oordeel het geschil betrekking heeft op doorvoer die reeds het onderwerp is of is geweest van de in de letters a) tot en met d) opgenomen procedures voor het beslechten van geschillen en deze procedures niet tot een oplossing van het geschil hebben geleid.  

f. De Conferentie van het Handvest stelt standaardbepalingen vast betreffende de afwikkeling van de bemiddelingsprocedure en de vergoeding van bemiddelaars.     
8.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel doet afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen van een Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens het internationale recht, met inbegrip van het internationaal gewoonterecht, alsook krachtens bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten, met inbegrip van voorschriften inzake onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen.   
9.  Dit artikel mag niet zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor een Verdragsluitende Partij die niet beschikt over een bepaald type energietransportvoorzieningen dat wordt gebruikt voor doorvoer verplicht is maatregelen met betrekking tot dat type energietransportvoorzieningen te nemen ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel. Deze Verdragsluitende Partij is echter verplicht te voldoen aan het bepaalde in het vierde lid.   
10.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt verstaan onder: 

a. „Doorvoer": 

i. de overbrenging via het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij, dan wel naar of van op het grondgebied van die partij gelegen haveninstallaties voor laden of lossen van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten die afkomstig zijn van het grondgebied van een andere staat en bestemd zijn voor het grondgebied van een derde staat, met dien verstande dat hetzij die andere staat, hetzij die derde staat een Verdragsluitende Partij is; of  

ii. de overbrenging via het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten die afkomstig zijn van het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij en bestemd zijn voor het grondgebied van die andere Verdragsluitende Partij, tenzij de twee betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen daarover anders beslissen en deze beslissing door middel van een gezamenlijke aantekening in bijlage N opnemen. De twee Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen hun aantekeningen in bijlage N doorhalen door een gezamenlijke schriftelijke kennisgeving van hun voornemen aan het Secretariaat, dat deze kennisgeving doorzendt aan alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen. De doorhaling wordt van kracht vier weken na de kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat.    

b. „Energietransportvoorzieningen": hogedruk-gaspijpleidingen, hoog spanningsgrid-netwerken, aardoliepijpleidingen, kolenslikpijpleidingen, pijpleidingen voor olieprodukten en andere vaste installaties die specifiek bestemd zijn voor het behandelen van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten.     

### Artikel  8  

####Overdracht van technologie

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen, onder voorbehoud van hun wetten en voorschriften en de bescherming van de intellectuele eigendom, de toegang tot en de overdracht van energietechnologie op commerciële en niet-discriminerende basis te bevorderen, ten einde de handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten en de investeringen te ondersteunen en het doel van het Handvest te verwezenlijken.   
2.  Voor zover nodig voor de toepassing van het eerste lid heffen de Verdragsluitende Partijen derhalve bestaande belemmeringen op, en creëren zij geen nieuwe belemmeringen voor de overdracht van technologie op het gebied van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, alsmede uitrusting en diensten die hiermee samenhangen, onder voorbehoud van non-proliferatieverplichtingen en andere internationale verplichtingen.   

### Artikel  9  

####Toegang tot kapitaal

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen erkennen het belang van open kapitaalmarkten voor het bevorderen van de kapitaalstroom voor de financiering van de handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten en voor het doen en ondersteunen van investeringen in economische activiteit in de energiesector op het grondgebied van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, met name die wier economie zich in een overgangssituatie bevindt. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij streeft er derhalve naar toegang tot haar kapitaalmarkt te bevorderen voor bedrijven en onderdanen van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, met het oog op de financiering van handelstransacties in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten en met het oog op investeringen in economische activiteit in de energiesector op het grondgebied van die andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, onder voorwaarden die niet minder gunstig zijn dan die welke onder vergelijkbare omstandigheden gelden voor haar eigen bedrijven en onderdanen of voor bedrijven en onderdanen van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of derde staat, al naar gelang welke voorwaarden het gunstigst zijn.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan programma's vaststellen en in stand houden die toegang verschaffen tot overheidsleningen, subsidies, garanties of verzekeringen ter vergemakkelijking van handelsactiviteiten of investeringen in het buitenland. Zij stelt deze faciliteiten beschikbaar, met inachtneming van de doelstellingen, beperkingen en criteria van de desbetreffende programma's (met inbegrip van overwegingen, doelstellingen, beperkingen of criteria met betrekking tot de vestigingsplaats van de aanvrager van een dergelijke faciliteit of de plaats van levering van met steun van deze faciliteit geleverde goederen of diensten) voor investeringen in de economische activiteit in de energiesector van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen of voor de financiering van handelstransacties met betrekking tot energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten met andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Bij de uitvoering van programma's op het gebied van de economische activiteit in de energiesector ter verbetering van de economische stabiliteit en het investeringsklimaat van de Verdragsluitende Partijen, streven deze op passende wijze ernaar om de werkzaamheden van de op dit gebied opererende internationale financiële instellingen te bevorderen en gebruik te maken van de bij die instellingen aanwezige deskundigheid.   
4.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel belet 

a. financiële instellingen om hun eigen op marktbeginselen en bedrijfseconomische overwegingen gebaseerde krediet- of verzekeringssysteem toe te passen; of  

b. een Verdragsluitende Partij maatregelen te nemen 

i. om bedrijfseconomische redenen, met inbegrip van de bescherming van investeerders, consumenten, depositeurs, polishouders of personen ten aanzien waarvan een verstrekker van financiële diensten een fiduciaire verplichting heeft;  

ii. om de integriteit en stabiliteit van haar financieel systeem en kapitaalmarkten te waarborgen.       

### DEEL  III  

####BEVORDERING BESCHERMING EN BEHANDELING VAN INVESTERINGEN

### Artikel  10  

####Bevordering, bescherming en behandeling van investeringen

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij bevordert en schept overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag stabiele, billijke, gunstige en doorzichtige voorwaarden voor het doen van investeringen op haar grondgebied door investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen. Tot die voorwaarden behoort de verbintenis investeringen van investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen steeds eerlijk en billijk te behandelen. Dergelijke investeringen genieten voorts duurzame bescherming en zekerheid en de Verdragsluitende Partijen doen niet met onredelijke of discriminerende maatregelen afbreuk aan het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik en het genot ervan en de beschikking erover. In geen geval mogen deze investeringen minder gunstig worden behandeld dan het internationale recht, met inbegrip van in het kader van verdragen aangegane verplichtingen, vereist. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij moet verplichtingen die zij is aangegaan ten aanzien van investeerders of met betrekking tot investeringen door investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij nakomen.   
2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij streeft ernaar investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen wat betreft het doen van investeringen op haar grondgebied de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling toe te kennen.   
3.  In dit artikel wordt onder „behandeling" verstaan een behandeling toegekend door een Verdragsluitende Partij die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke zij toekent aan haar eigen investeerders of aan de investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of een derde staat, al naar gelang welke behandeling het gunstigst is.   
4.  Bij een aanvullend verdrag wordt, onder daarin op te nemen voorwaarden, aan elke partij daarbij de verplichting opgelegd om, wat betreft het doen van investeringen op haar grondgebied, aan investeerders van andere partijen de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling toe te kennen. Dit aanvullende verdrag staat open voor ondertekening door de staten en regionale organisaties voor economische integratie die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend of daartoe zijn toegetreden. De onderhandelingen over het aanvullende verdrag beginnen uiterlijk op 1 januari 1995 en het ligt in de bedoeling deze op 1 januari 1998 af te ronden.   
5.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij streeft ernaar om, wat betreft het doen van investeringen op haar grondgebied: 

a. uitzonderingen op de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling tot een minimum te beperken;  

b. bestaande beperkingen voor investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen geleidelijk weg te nemen.     
6.  

a. Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan, wat betreft het doen van investeringen op haar grondgebied, te allen tijde, via het Secretariaat, de Conferentie van het Handvest uit eigen beweging in kennis stellen van haar voornemen geen nieuwe uitzonderingen op de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling vast te stellen.  

b. Voorts kan een Verdragsluitende Partij te allen tijde uit eigen beweging de verplichting op zich nemen om, wat betreft het doen van investeringen in een aantal van de of in alle economische activiteiten in de energiesector op haar grondgebied, investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling toe te kennen. Een dergelijke verplichting dient ter kennis van het Secretariaat te worden gebracht en in bijlage VC te worden opgenomen en is bindend krachtens dit Verdrag.     
7.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kent aan investeringen op haar grondgebied van investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, en daarmee verband houdende activiteiten waaronder het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik en het genot daarvan of de beschikking daarover, een niet minder gunstige behandeling toe dan aan investeringen van haar eigen investeerders of van investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of derde staat en daarmee verband houdende activiteiten waaronder het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik, het genot daarvan of de beschikking daarover, al naar gelang welke behandeling het gunstigst is.   
8.  De modaliteiten voor de toepassing van het zevende lid met betrekking tot programma's in het kader waarvan een Verdragsluitende Partij subsidies of andere financiële steun verleent of contracten afsluit voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling op het gebied van energietechnologie, worden opgenomen in het in het vierde lid bedoelde aanvullende verdrag. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij stelt de Conferentie van het Handvest via het Secretariaat in kennis van de modaliteiten die zij toepast ten aanzien van de in dit lid bedoelde programma's.   
9.  Elke staat of regionale organisatie voor economische integratie die dit Verdrag ondertekent of tot dit Verdrag toetreedt, dient op de dag waarop hij/zij het Verdrag ondertekent of de akte van toetreding nederlegt, bij het Secretariaat een verslag in waarin een overzicht wordt gegeven van alle wettelijke, bestuursrechtelijke en andere maatregelen met betrekking tot: 

a. uitzonderingen op het tweede lid;  

b. de in het achtste lid bedoelde programma's.   Een Verdragsluitende Partij meldt met het oog op het actueel houden van haar verslag onverwijld elke wijziging bij het Secretariaat. De Conferentie van het Handvest bestudeert deze verslagen op gezette tijden. Met betrekking tot het bepaalde in letter a. kunnen in het verslag delen van de energiesector worden aangewezen waarin een Verdragsluitende Partij investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen de in het derde lid omschreven behandeling toekent. Met betrekking tot het bepaalde in letter b. kunnen bij de bestudering van het verslag door de Conferentie van het Handvest de effecten van dergelijke programma's op mededinging en investeringen in beschouwing worden genomen.   
10.  Ongeacht enige andere bepaling van dit artikel geldt de in het derde en het zevende lid omschreven behandeling niet voor de bescherming van intellectuele eigendom; de daarvoor geldende behandeling is die welke is omschreven in de desbetreffende bepalingen van de vigerende internationale overeenkomsten inzake de bescherming van de intellectuele eigendom waarbij de onderscheiden Verdragsluitende Partijen partij zijn.   
11.  Voor de toepassing van artikel 26 wordt de toepassing door een Verdragsluitende Partij van een investeringsmaatregel op handelsgebied als bedoeld in artikel 5, eerste en tweede lid, op een op dat tijdstip reeds bestaande investering van een investeerder van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij beschouwd, behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 5, derde en vierde lid, als een inbreuk op een verplichting van eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens dit Deel.   
12.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij zorgt ervoor dat haar interne wetgeving doeltreffende middelen biedt voor het doen gelden van aanspraken en de handhaving van rechten betreffende investeringen, investeringsovereenkomsten en investeringsvergunningen.   

### Artikel  11  

####Stafpersoneel

1.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij behandelt, onder voorbehoud van haar wettelijke en bestuursrechtelijke bepalingen betreffende binnenkomst, verblijf en arbeid van een natuurlijke persoon, te goeder trouw verzoeken van investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij en van stafpersoneel in dienst van dergelijke investeerders of werkzaam in het kader van investeringen van dergelijke investeerders; om haar grondgebied binnen te mogen komen en daar tijdelijk te verblijven voor activiteiten in verband met het doen of de ontwikkeling, het beheer, de instandhouding, het gebruik en het genot van of de beschikking over relevante investeringen, met inbegrip van het verstrekken van adviezen of essentiële technische diensten.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij staat aan investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij die investeringen op haar grondgebied hebben en voor investeringen van dergelijke investeerders toe naar keuze van die investeerder of investering stafleden in dienst te nemen, ongeacht nationaliteit en staatsburgerschap, op voorwaarde dat de betrokken stafleden toestemming hebben gekregen om het grondgebied van de eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij binnen te komen en daar te verblijven en te werken, en dat het betrokken dienstverband in overeenstemming is met de voorwaarden en termijnen die verbonden zijn aan de voor die stafleden verleende toestemming.   

### Artikel  12  

####Compensatie van verliezen

1.  Behoudens wanneer artikel 13 van toepassing is, wordt aan een investeerder van een Verdragsluitende Partij die met betrekking tot een investering op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een verlies lijdt ten gevolge van oorlog of een ander gewapend conflict, een nationale noodtoestand, burgerlijke ongeregeldheden of andere soortgelijke gebeurtenissen op dat grondgebied door laatstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij wat betreft restitutie, schadeloosstelling, compensatie of een andere regeling de gunstigste behandeling toegekend welke die Partij andere investeerders, hetzij eigen investeerders, hetzij investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, hetzij investeerders van een derde staat, toekent.   
2.  Onverminderd het eerste lid wordt een investeerder van een Verdragsluitende Partij die in één van de in het eerste lid genoemde situaties op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een verlies lijdt ten gevolge van 

a. de vordering van zijn investering of een deel daarvan door de strijdkrachten of de overheid van die Verdragsluitende Partij, of  

b. de vernietiging van zijn investering of een deel daarvan door de strijdkrachten of de overheid van die Verdragsluitende Partij, anders dan onder dwang van de omstandigheden,   restitutie of vergoeding toegekend, die in beide gevallen prompt, adequaat en doeltreffend is.   

### Artikel  13  

####Onteigening

1.  Investeringen van investeerders van een Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij mogen niet worden genationaliseerd, onteigend of onderworpen aan maatregelen met een soortgelijk effect als nationalisatie of onteigening (hierna te noemen „onteigening"), behalve wanneer de onteigening: 

a. geschiedt in het algemeen belang;  

b. niet discriminerend is;  

c. geschiedt met inachtneming van een behoorlijke rechtsgang; en  

d. gepaard gaat met de betaling van prompte, adequate en doeltreffende compensatie.   Die compensatie is gelijk aan de billijke marktwaarde van de onteigende investering op het tijdstip vlak voordat de onteigening of op handen zijnde onteigening zodanig bekend werd dat de investeringswaarde werd beïnvloed (hierna te noemen: de „datum van de waardebepaling"). Deze billijke marktwaarde wordt op verzoek van de investeerder berekend in een vrij inwisselbare valuta volgens de voor die valuta op de datum van de waardebepaling geldende marktwisselkoers. De compensatie omvat tevens rente over de periode tussen de onteigenings- en de betalingsdatum, welke berekend wordt tegen een commercieel, op marktbasis vastgesteld tarief.   
2.  De betrokken investeerder heeft recht op onverwijlde toetsing, krachtens het recht van de Verdragsluitende Partij die de onteigening verricht, van zijn zaak, de waardebepaling van zijn investeringen en de betaling van compensatie overeenkomstig de beginselen neergelegd in het eerste lid, door een gerechtelijke of andere onafhankelijke bevoegde instantie van die Partij.   
3.  Voor alle duidelijkheid wordt bepaald dat onteigening ook de gevallen omvat waarin een Verdragsluitende Partij de activa onteigent van een vennootschap of onderneming op haar grondgebied waarin een investeerder van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een investering, ook indien via aandelenbezit, heeft.   

### Artikel  14  

####Overmakingen van gelden in verband met investeringen

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt met betrekking tot investeringen op haar grondgebied door investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij het vrij verrichten van overmakingen van gelden naar en van haar grondgebied, waaronder de overmaking van: 

a. aanvangskapitaal en aanvullend kapitaal voor de instandhouding en ontwikkeling van een investering;  

b. opbrengsten;  

c. betalingen uit hoofde van een contract, met inbegrip van de aflossing van de hoofdsom en de betaling van de lopende rente ingevolge een leningsovereenkomst;  

d. onuitgegeven inkomsten en andere bezoldigingen van personeel dat in verband met die investering uit het buitenland aangeworven is;  

e. opbrengsten uit de volledige of gedeeltelijke verkoop of liquidatie van een investering of een deel daarvan;  

f. betalingen die voortvloeien uit de beslechting van een geschil; en  

g. compensatiebetalingen overeenkomstig de artikelen 12 en 13.     
2.  De in het eerste lid genoemde overmakingen geschieden onverwijld en in een vrij inwisselbare valuta.   
3.  Overmakingen worden verricht tegen de op de datum van de overmaking geldende wisselkoers voor spottransacties in de over te maken valuta. Bij ontstentenis van een deviezenmarkt is de toe te passen koers de meest recente koers die wordt toegepast op investeringen vanuit het buitenland of de meest recente wisselkoers die wordt toegepast voor de omrekening van valuta's in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, al naar gelang welke koers voor de investeerder het gunstigst is.   
4.  Ongeacht het bepaalde in het eerste, tweede en derde lid kan een Verdragsluitende Partij de rechten van crediteuren beschermen of naleving van wetten betreffende de uitgifte van en de handel in waardepapieren en van beslissingen in civiel-, bestuurs- en strafrechtelijke arbitrageprocedures waarborgen, door het op billijke, niet discriminerende wijze en te goeder trouw toepassen van haar wetten en voorschriften.   
5.  Ongeacht het bepaalde in het tweede lid kunnen Verdragsluitende Partijen die staten zijn die deel uitmaakten van de voormalige Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken, in onderling gesloten overeenkomsten bepalen dat overmakingen van betalingen worden uitgevoerd in de valuta's van die Partijen, mits dergelijke overeenkomsten er niet toe leiden dat investeringen op hun grondgebied van investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen minder gunstig worden behandeld dan investeringen van investeerders van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die een dergelijke overeenkomst zijn aangegaan of investeringen van investeerders van een derde staat.   
6.  Ongeacht het bepaalde in het eerste lid, letter b), kan een Verdragsluitende Partij de overbrenging van opbrengsten in natura beperken in gevallen waarin die Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), of de WTO-Overeenkomst gemachtigd is om de uitvoer of de verkoop voor uitvoer van het produkt waarin de opbrengst in natura bestaat te beperken of te verbieden, met dien verstande dat de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij toestaat opbrengsten in natura uit te keren zoals goedgekeurd of aangegeven in een investeringsovereenkomst, investeringsvergunning of andere schriftelijke overeenkomst tussen de Verdragsluitende Partij en een investeerder van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of diens investering.   

### Artikel  15  

####Subrogatie

1.  Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij of de door haar aangewezen instantie (de „schadeloos stellende partij" een betaling verricht uit hoofde van een schadeloosstelling of waarborg voor een investering van een investeerder (de „schadeloos gestelde partij") op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij (de „gastpartij") erkent de gastpartij dat 

a. alle uit die investering voortvloeiende rechten en vorderingen worden overgedragen aan de schadeloos stellende partij, en  

b. de schadeloos stellende partij gerechtigd is die rechten en die vorderingen op grond van subrogatie af te dwingen.     
2.  De schadeloos stellende partij kan te allen tijde aanspraak maken op 

a. dezelfde behandeling op het gebied van rechten en vorderingen die zij op grond van de in het eerste lid bedoelde overdracht heeft verworven, en  

b. dezelfde uit hoofde van die rechten en vorderingen te ontvangen bedragen   als waarop de schadeloos gestelde partij krachtens dit Verdrag recht had in verband met de betrokken investering.   
3.  Bij een procedure ingevolge artikel 26 mag een Verdragsluitende Partij niet als verdediging, motivering voor een tegeneis of voor aanspraak op vergoeding of om enige andere reden aanvoeren dat voor de naar bewering geleden schade of een deel daarvan uit hoofde van een verzekering of een waarborgbeding een schadeloosstelling of andere vorm van compensatie is of zal worden ontvangen.   

### Artikel  16  

####Verhouding tot andere overeenkomsten

Wanneer twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen reeds een internationale overeenkomst zijn aangegaan, of naderhand een internationale overeenkomst aangaan, waarvan de bepalingen betrekking hebben op het onderwerp van Deel III of Deel V van dit Verdrag, 

1. mag geen enkele bepaling van Deel III of Deel V van dit Verdrag zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor afbreuk wordt gedaan aan een bepaling in die overeenkomst, of aan een recht om geschillen ter zake krachtens die overeenkomst te regelen, en  

2. mag geen enkele bepaling in die overeenkomst zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor afbreuk wordt gedaan aan een bepaling van Deel III of Deel V van dit Verdrag of aan een recht om geschillen ter zake krachtens dit Verdrag te regelen,   wanneer die bepaling gunstiger is voor de investeerder of de investering.  

### Artikel  17  

####Niet-toepassing van Deel III onder bepaalde omstandigheden

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij behoudt zich het recht voor de voordelen van dit Deel te ontzeggen aan: 

1. een rechtspersoon, indien staatsburgers of onderdanen van een derde staat eigenaar zijn van of zeggenschap hebben over een dergelijke rechtspersoon en indien die rechtspersoon geen wezenlijke zakelijke activiteiten heeft op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar hij is opgericht, of  

2. een investering, indien de ontzeggende Verdragsluitende Partij vaststelt dat het een investering betreft van een investeerder van een derde staat waarmee of ten aanzien waarvan de ontzeggende Verdragsluitende Partij 

a. geen diplomatieke betrekkingen onderhoudt, of  

b. maatregelen treft of handhaaft die 

i. transacties met investeerders van die staat verbieden, of  

ii. overtreden of omzeild zouden worden indien de voordelen van dit Deel zouden worden verleend aan investeerders van die staat of aan hun investeringen.        

### DEEL  IV  

####DIVERSE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  18  

####Soevereiniteit over energiebronnen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen erkennen de soevereiniteit en de soevereine rechten van de staten met betrekking tot energiebronnen. Zij bevestigen opnieuw dat deze moeten worden uitgeoefend in overeenstemming met en met inachtneming van de regels van het internationaal recht.   
2.  Onverminderd de doelstelling de toegang tot energiebronnen en de exploratie en ontwikkeling daarvan op commerciële grondslag te bevorderen, laat het Verdrag de binnen de Verdragsluitende Partijen geldende regels inzake de eigendom van energiebronnen onverlet.   
3.  Elke staat behoudt in het bijzonder het recht vast te stellen welke geografische gebieden binnen zijn grondgebied gebruikt mogen worden voor de exploratie en ontwikkeling van zijn energiebronnen, op welke wijze een optimale winning kan plaatsvinden, in welk tempo zij mogen worden uitgeput of geëxploiteerd, alsmede het recht belastingen, royalty's of andere financiële vergoedingen voor die exploratie en exploitatie vast te stellen en te ontvangen, het recht voorschriften vast te stellen inzake de milieu- en veiligheidsaspecten van die exploratie, ontwikkeling en winning op zijn grondgebied, en het recht aan die exploratie en exploitatie deel te nemen, onder andere via directe overheidsparticipatie of via overheidsbedrijven.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe de toegang tot de energiebronnen te vergemakkelijken, onder andere door op niet discriminerende wijze aan de hand van gepubliceerde criteria, machtigingen, vergunningen, concessies en contracten te verlenen voor de prospectie en exploratie, dan wel voor de exploitatie of winning van energiebronnen.   

### Artikel  19  

####Milieu-aspecten

1.  Met het oog op duurzame ontwikkeling en rekening houdend met haar verplichtingen krachtens de internationale milieu-overeenkomsten waarbij zij partij is streeft elke Verdragsluitende Partij ernaar schadelijke milieu-effecten, zowel binnen als buiten haar grondgebied, die worden veroorzaakt door werkzaamheden, ongeacht de aard daarvan, binnen de energiecyclus op haar grondgebied op economisch verantwoorde wijze zo gering mogelijk te houden, daarbij naar behoren rekening houdend met veiligheidsoverwegingen. Daarbij handelt elke Verdragsluitende Partij op een wijze die een goede kosten/baten-verhouding waarborgt. In haar beleid en optreden streeft elke Verdragsluitende Partij ernaar voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen om achteruitgang van het milieu te voorkomen of zo gering mogelijk te houden. De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen dat de vervuiler op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partijen in beginsel de kosten van verontreiniging met inbegrip van grensoverschrijdende verontreiniging draagt, waarbij naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met het openbare belang en investeringen in de energiecyclus of de internationale handel niet mogen worden verstoord. De Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen derhalve: 

a. bij de opstelling en uitvoering van hun energiebeleid voortdurend rekening houden met milieu-overwegingen;  

b. bevorderen dat de prijsvorming in de gehele energiecyclus marktgericht is en dat milieukosten en -voordelen daarin vollediger weerspiegeld worden;  

c. gelet op artikel 34, vierde lid, samenwerking bevorderen bij het bereiken van de milieudoelstellingen van het Handvest alsook op het gebied van internationale milieunormen voor de energiecyclus, rekening houdend met de verschillen tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen qua nadelige effecten en bestrijdingskosten;  

d. in het bijzonder aandacht schenken aan de verbetering van de energie-efficiëntie, de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van hernieuwbare energiebronnen, de bevordering van het gebruik van schonere brandstoffen en de toepassing van technologieën en technologische middelen die de verontreiniging verminderen;  

e. het vergaren en tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen uitwisselen bevorderen van informatie over milieuvriendelijke en economisch doelmatige vormen van energiebeleid en rendabele praktijken en technologieën;  

f. bij het publiek het besef bevorderen van de milieu-effecten van energiesystemen, de mogelijkheden van voorkoming of bestrijding van de nadelige milieu-effecten daarvan, en de kosten die aan de diverse voorkomings- of bestrijdingsmaatregelen zijn verbonden;  

g. onderzoek, ontwikkeling en toepassing van energie-efficiënte en milieuvriendelijke technologieën, praktijken en procédés die de schadelijke milieu-effecten van alle aspecten van de energiecyclus op een economisch doelmatige wijze tot een minimum zullen reduceren, bevorderen en daarbij samenwerken;  

h. gunstige voorwaarden stimuleren voor de overdracht en verspreiding van dergelijke technologieën die te verenigen zijn met een toereikende en doeltreffende bescherming van de intellectuele eigendom;  

i. bevorderen dat de milieu-effecten van uit milieu-oogpunt significante investeringsprojecten op energiegebied in een vroeg stadium en voordat een besluit wordt genomen op doorzichtige wijze worden beoordeeld en vervolgens worden bewaakt;  

j. op internationaal niveau de kennis en de uitwisseling van informatie over relevante milieuprogramma's en -normen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen en de uitvoering van die programma's en normen bevorderen;  

k. op verzoek en binnen de grenzen van hun beschikbare middelen deelnemen aan de ontwikkeling en uitvoering van passende milieuprogramma's op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partijen.     
2.  Op verzoek van een of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen worden geschillen betreffende de toepassing of uitlegging van bepalingen van dit artikel door de Conferentie van het Handvest met het oog op een oplossing onderzocht, voorzover er geen regelingen voor de behandeling van dergelijke geschillen bestaan binnen andere ter zake bevoegde internationale organen.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt verstaan onder: 

a. „energiecyclus": de gehele energieketen met inbegrip van activiteiten in verband met prospectie, exploratie, produktie, omzetting, opslag, vervoer, distributie en verbruik van de verschillende vormen van energie, alsmede de behandeling en verwijdering van afvalstoffen en het niet langer verrichten en afsluiten van deze activiteiten met zo weinig mogelijk schadelijke milieu-effecten;  

b. „milieu-effecten": alle door een bepaalde activiteit veroorzaakte effecten op het milieu, met inbegrip van gezondheid en veiligheid van de mens, flora, fauna, bodem, lucht, water, klimaat, landschap en historische monumenten of andere fysieke structuren of de onderlinge beïnvloeding van deze factoren; dit begrip omvat tevens effecten op het cultureel erfgoed of de sociaal-economische omstandigheden als gevolg van wijzigingen van die factoren;  

c. „verbetering van de energie-efficiëntie": een zodanig optreden, dat dezelfde hoeveelheid van een goed of een dienst wordt geproduceerd zonder dat de kwaliteit of prestatie ervan wordt verminderd, doch de voor die produktie vereiste hoeveelheid energie wordt verminderd;  

d. „met een goede kosten/baten-verhouding": het bereiken van een gesteld doel tegen de laagste kosten of het bereiken van het beste resultaat tegen gegeven kosten.     

### Artikel  20  

####Doorzichtigheid

1.  In overeenstemming met artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), behoren wetten, voorschriften, rechterlijke besluiten en algemene bestuursrechtelijke beslissingen die van invloed zijn op de handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten of uitrusting op energiegebied, tot de maatregelen die onderworpen zijn aan de doorzichtigheidsregels van de WTO-Overeenkomst.   
2.  Wetten, voorschriften, rechterlijke besluiten en algemene bestuursrechtelijke beslissingen die een Verdragsluitende Partij in werking heeft doen treden, en vigerende overeenkomsten tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen die van invloed zijn op andere onder dit Verdrag vallende aangelegenheden worden eveneens onverwijld op zodanige wijze bekend gemaakt dat de Verdragsluitende Partijen en investeerders daarvan kennis kunnen nemen. Uit hoofde van dit lid kan een Verdragsluitende Partij niet worden verplicht vertrouwelijke informatie te onthullen die de rechtshandhaving belemmert, anderszins strijdig is met het openbaar belang of afbreuk doet aan de rechtmatige commerciële belangen van een investeerder.   
3.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij wijst één of meer informatiebureaus aan waartoe men zich kan wenden met verzoeken om informatie over bovengenoemde wetten, voorschriften, rechterlijke besluiten en bestuursrechtelijke beslissingen en doet daarvan onverwijld mededeling aan het Secretariaat, dat deze aanwijzing op verzoek mededeelt.   

### Artikel  21  

####Belastingen

1.  Behalve als bepaald in dit artikel worden door geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag rechten verleend of verplichtingen opgelegd met betrekking tot belastingmaatregelen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen. In geval van onverenigbaarheid van dit artikel met andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag heeft dit artikel, wat de onverenigbaarheid betreft, de voorrang.   
2.  Artikel 7, derde lid, is van toepassing op andere belastingmaatregelen dan belastingen op inkomen of kapitaal, met dien verstande dat de bepalingen van die artikelen niet van toepassing zijn op: 

a. een voordeel dat een Verdragsluitende Partij heeft toegekend overeenkomstig de belastingbepalingen van een verdrag, overeenkomst of regeling als bedoeld in het zesde lid, letter a), onder ii), van dit artikel; of  

b. een belastingmaatregel die ten doel heeft de doeltreffende inning van belastingen te waarborgen, behalve indien die maatregel van een Verdragsluitende Partij een willekeurige discriminatie tussen energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij of een willekeurige beperking van de krachtens de betreffende bepalingen van artikel 7, derde lid, toegekende voordelen inhoudt.     
3.  Artikel 10, tweede en zevende lid, zijn van toepassing op andere belastingmaatregelen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen dan belastingen op inkomen of kapitaal, met dien verstande dat geen van deze bepalingen: 

a. ertoe strekt dat verplichtingen tot toepassing van het meestbegunstigingsbeginsel worden opgelegd met betrekking tot voordelen die een Verdragsluitende Partij heeft toegekend overeenkomstig de belastingbepalingen van een verdrag, overeenkomst of regeling als bedoeld in het zevende lid, letter a), onder ii), van dit artikel of als uitvloeisel van het lidmaatschap van een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie; of  

b. van toepassing is op een belastingmaatregel die ten doel heeft de doeltreffende inning van belastingen te waarborgen, behalve indien de maatregel een willekeurige discriminatie tussen investeerders van de Verdragsluitende Partijen of een willekeurige beperking van de krachtens de investeringsbepalingen van dit Verdrag toegekende voordelen inhoudt.     
4.  Artikel 29, tweede tot en met achtste lid, is van toepassing op andere belastingmaatregelen dan belastingen op inkomen of kapitaal.   
5.  

a. Artikel 13 is van toepassing op belastingen.  

b. Wanneer in het kader van artikel 13 een geschil rijst, voor zover het betrekking heeft op de vraag of een belasting een onteigening vormt, dan wel of een belasting waarvan wordt beweerd dat deze een onteigening vormt, discriminerend is, geldt het volgende: 

i. De investeerder of de Verdragsluitende Partij die aanvoert dat er sprake is van onteigening legt het geschil over de vraag of de maatregel een onteigening dan wel discriminerend is, voor aan de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten. Laat de investeerder of de Verdragsluitende Partij dit na, dan leggen de instanties die worden verzocht geschillen te beslechten overeenkomstig artikel 26, tweede lid, letter c), of artikel 27, tweede lid, het geschil voor aan de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten.  

ii. De bevoegde belastingautoriteiten streven ernaar om het aldus voorgelegde geschil binnen een periode van zes maanden te regelen. Indien het gaat om een geschil inzake non-discriminatie, passen de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten de bepalingen inzake non-discriminatie van het relevante belastingverdrag toe, of passen zij, indien er geen non-discriminatiebepaling voorkomt in het op de belasting van toepassing zijnde relevante belastingverdrag of indien er geen belastingverdrag tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen van kracht is, de non-discriminatiebeginselen overeenkomstig het modelverdrag van de OESO betreffende belastingen op inkomen en kapitaal toe.  

iii. De instanties die worden verzocht geschillen te regelen overeenkomstig artikel 26, tweede lid, letter c), of artikel 27, tweede lid, kunnen rekening houden met eventuele conclusies van de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten over de vraag of de belasting een onteigening is. Die instanties houden rekening met eventuele binnen de bij letter b), onder ii), voorgeschreven termijn van zes maanden door de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten getrokken conclusies over de vraag of de belasting discriminerend is. Deze instanties kunnen ook rekening houden met eventuele na het verstrijken van de voorgeschreven periode van zes maanden door de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten getrokken conclusies.  

iv. In geen geval mag de betrokkenheid van de bevoegde belastingautoriteiten na het einde van de bij letter b), onder ii), bedoelde periode van zes maanden leiden tot een vertraging van de procedures ingevolge de artikelen 26 en 27.       
6.  Voor alle duidelijkheid wordt bepaald dat artikel 14 het recht van een Verdragsluitende Partij om een belasting op te leggen of te innen via bronheffing of andere middelen niet beperkt.   
7.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel: 

a. omvat de term „belastingmaatregel”: 

i. de bepalingen betreffende belastingen van de interne wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij of van een staatsrechtelijke onderverdeling of een plaatselijke autoriteit ervan; en  

ii. de bepalingen betreffende belastingen van verdragen ter voorkoming van dubbele belasting en van internationale overeenkomsten of regelingen waaraan de Verdragsluitende Partij gebonden is.    

b. worden als belastingen op het inkomen en het vermogen beschouwd alle belastingen die worden geheven op het gehele inkomen, op het gehele vermogen of op bestanddelen van het inkomen of vermogen, met inbegrip van belastingen op winsten uit de vervreemding van eigendom, onroerend-zaakbelasting, successierechten, belastingen op schenkingen of in wezen soortgelijke belastingen, belastingen op het totaalbedrag van de door ondernemingen betaalde lonen of salarissen, alsmede belastingen op de waardevermeerdering van vermogen.  

c. wordt onder „bevoegde belastingautoriteit” verstaan de bevoegde autoriteit overeenkomstig een overeenkomst inzake dubbele belasting tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen, of, bij ontstentenis van een van kracht zijnde overeenkomst de/het voor belastingen bevoegde minister of ministerie of hun gemachtigde vertegenwoordigers.  

d. voor alle duidelijkheid wordt bepaald dat de termen „belastingbepalingen" en „belastingen" geen betrekking hebben op douanerechten.     

### Artikel  22  

####Overheidsbedrijven en ondernemingen met een bevoorrechte status

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt dat een overheidsbedrijf dat zij opricht of in stand houdt zijn activiteiten met betrekking tot de verkoop of levering van goederen en diensten op haar grondgebied uitoefent op een wijze die strookt met de verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van Deel III van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij moedigt een overheidsbedrijf niet aan of eist niet van dat bedrijf dat het zijn activiteiten op haar grondgebied uitoefent op een wijze die niet strookt met de verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
3.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij waarborgt dat indien zij een lichaam opricht of in stand houdt en daaraan een regelgevende, administratiefrechtelijke of andere bestuursbevoegdheid verleent, het lichaam de bevoegdheid uitoefent op een wijze die strookt met de verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag.   
4.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij moedigt een lichaam waaraan zij uitsluitende of bijzondere voorrechten verleent, niet aan of eist niet van dat lichaam dat het zijn activiteiten op haar grondgebied uitoefent op een wijze die niet strookt met de verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag.   
5.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt de term „lichaam" geacht elke onderneming, instelling of andere organisatie of persoon te omvatten.   

### Artikel  23  

####Naleving door lagere overheden

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij is uit hoofde van dit Verdrag geheel verantwoordelijk voor de naleving van alle bepalingen van het Verdrag en treft daartoe alle haar ter beschikking staande redelijke maatregelen om naleving door de regionale en plaatselijke overheden en andere bestuurslichamen op haar grondgebied te waarborgen.   
2.  De bepalingen inzake regeling van geschillen in de Delen II, IV en V van dit Verdrag kunnen worden ingeroepen voor maatregelen die van invloed zijn op de naleving van het Verdrag door een Verdragsluitende Partij en die zijn getroffen door regionale of plaatselijke overheden of andere bestuurslichamen op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  24  

####Uitzonderingen

1.  Dit artikel is niet van toepassing op de artikelen 12, 13 en 29.   
2.  Andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag dan 

a. de in het eerste lid genoemde bepalingen; en  

b. wat het bepaalde onder i) betreft, de bepalingen van Deel III van het Verdrag beletten een Verdragsluitende Partij niet maatregelen aan te nemen of te doen uitvoeren: 

i. die nodig zijn om het leven en de gezondheid van mensen, dieren of planten te beschermen;  

ii. die van essentieel belang zijn voor de aankoop of distributie van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten in een situatie waarin de voorziening onvoldoende is door omstandigheden buiten de macht van die Verdragsluitende Partij, op voorwaarde dat deze maatregelen stroken met het beginsel dat 

A. alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen recht hebben op een billijk deel van de internationale voorziening van dergelijke energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten; en  

B. elke maatregel van dien aard die niet strookt met dit Verdrag onmiddellijk wordt opgeheven, zodra er een eind komt aan de situatie die er aanleiding toe was; of    

iii. ten behoeve van investeerders die leden van inlandse bevolkingsgroepen of personen of groepen met een sociale of economische achterstand zijn, of van hun investeringen, welke maatregelen als zodanig bij het Secretariaat worden aangemeld, op voorwaarde dat deze maatregelen 

A. geen wezenlijk effect hebben op de economie van die Verdragsluitende Partij; en  

B. voor buiten de doelgroep van die maatregelen vallende investeerders, geen onderscheid maken tussen investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij en investeerders van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij,     mits deze maatregelen geen verkapte beperkingen op economische activiteit in de energiesector vormen of een willekeurige of niet te rechtvaardigen discriminatie tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen of tussen investeerders of andere belanghebbenden van Verdragsluitende Partijen. Dergelijke maatregelen worden naar behoren gemotiveerd en mogen een voordeel dat één of meer andere Verdragsluitende Partijen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag redelijkerwijs mogen verwachten niet méér neutraliseren of verminderen dan strikt voor het aangegeven doel nodig is.     
3.  Andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag dan de in het eerste lid bedoelde mogen niet zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor een Verdragsluitende Partij wordt belet een maatregel te treffen welke die partij noodzakelijk acht: 

a. voor de bescherming van haar essentiële veiligheidsbelangen, met inbegrip van maatregelen: 

i. met betrekking tot de voorziening van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten van een militaire inrichting; of  

ii. in oorlogstijd, bij gewapende conflicten of andere noodsituaties in de internationale betrekkingen;    

b. met betrekking tot de uitvoering van nationaal beleid tot inachtneming van de niet-verspreiding van kernwapens of andere nucleaire explosiemiddelen of dat vereist is om te voldoen aan haar verplichtingen uit hoofde van het Verdrag inzake de niet-verspreiding van kernwapens, de Richtlijnen voor internationale nucleaire transacties en andere internationale verplichtingen of afspraken met betrekking tot de niet-verspreiding van kernwapens; of  

c. voor de handhaving van de openbare orde.   Een dergelijke maatregel mag geen verkapte doorvoerbeperking vormen.   
4.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag die voorzien in toepassing van het meestbegunstigingsbeginsel houden voor een Verdragsluitende Partij niet de verplichting in ook ten aanzien van de investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij een preferentiële behandeling toe te passen die: 

a. voortvloeit uit haar lidmaatschap van een vrijhandelsassociatie of douane-unie; of  

b. wordt toegekend uit hoofde van een bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomst inzake economische samenwerking tussen staten die deel uitmaakten van de voormalige Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken, in afwachting van een definitieve regeling van hun wederzijdse economische betrekkingen.     

### Artikel  25  

####Overeenkomsten tot economische integratie

1.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag mogen niet zo worden uitgelegd dat daardoor een Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij een overeenkomst tot economische integratie (hierna te noemen „OEI") verplicht is een tussen de partijen bij die OEI uit hoofde van hun lidmaatschap daarvan geldende preferentiële behandeling via de toepassing van het meestbegunstigingsbeginsel uit te breiden tot een andere Verdragsluitende Partij die geen partij is bij die OEI.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid wordt verstaan onder „OEI" een overeenkomst die gericht is op een substantiële liberalisering, onder andere van handel en investeringen, door alle discriminatie tussen of onder de partijen daarbij geheel of grotendeels weg te nemen via de afschaffing van bestaande discriminerende maatregelen en/of een verbod op nieuwe of stringentere discriminerende maatregelen, hetzij bij de inwerkingtreding van die overeenkomst of binnen een redelijke termijn.   
3.  Dit artikel laat de toepassing van de WTO-Overeenkomst krachtens artikel 29 onverlet.   

### DEEL  V  

####REGELING VAN GESCHILLEN

### Artikel  26  

####Regeling van geschillen tussen een investeerder en een Verdragsluitende Partij

1.  Geschillen tussen een Verdragsluitende Partij en een investeerder van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij over een investering van deze laatste op het grondgebied van eerstgenoemde Partij, die betrekking hebben op de beweerde niet-nakoming van een verplichting van eerstgenoemde Partij die voortvloeit uit Deel III van dit Verdrag, worden, zo mogelijk, door middel van een minnelijke schikking geregeld.   
2.  Indien dergelijke geschillen niet overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het eerste lid kunnen worden geregeld binnen een periode van drie maanden vanaf de datum waarop één van beide partijen bij het geschil om een minnelijke schikking heeft verzocht, wordt het geschil op verzoek van de betrokken investeerder voorgelegd: 

a. aan de rechters of administratiefrechtelijke instanties van de Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, of  

b. in overeenstemming met een toepasselijke, eerder overeengekomen procedure voor regeling van geschillen, of  

c. in overeenstemming met de volgende leden van dit artikel.     
3.  

a. Met inachtneming van uitsluitend het bepaalde in de letters b) en c) geeft elke Verdragsluitende Partij haar onvoorwaardelijke toestemming om een geschil te onderwerpen aan internationale arbitrage of bemiddeling overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit artikel.  

b. 

i. De in bijlage ID vermelde Verdragsluitende Partijen geven deze onvoorwaardelijke toestemming niet voor gevallen waarin de investeerder het geschil reeds eerder heeft voorgelegd overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letters a) of b).  

ii. Terwille van de doorzichtigheid doet elke in bijlage ID vermelde Verdragsluitende Partij, uiterlijk op de datum van nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring overeenkomstig artikel 39 of van de nederlegging van haar akte van toetreding overeenkomstig artikel 41, een schriftelijke verklaring over haar beleid, procedures en voorwaarden terzake aan het Secretariaat toekomen.    

c. Een in bijlage IA vermelde Verdragsluitende Partij geeft deze onvoorwaardelijke toestemming niet voor geschillen in verband met de laatste zin van artikel 10, eerste lid.     
4.  Indien de investeerder kiest voor de in het tweede lid, letter c), genoemde mogelijkheid, stemt hij er voorts schriftelijk mee in dat het geschil wordt voorgelegd aan: 

a. 

i. het Internationale Centrum voor Beslechting van Investeringsgeschillen, opgericht krachtens het Verdrag inzake de beslechting van geschillen met betrekking tot investeringen tussen Staten en onderdanen van andere Staten, dat op 18 maart 1965 in Washington voor ondertekening is opengesteld (hierna te noemen: ICSID-Verdrag), indien de Verdragsluitende Partij van de investeerder en de Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil beide partij zijn bij het ICSID-Verdrag, of  

ii. het Internationale Centrum voor Beslechting van Investeringsgeschillen, dat uit hoofde van het in letter a), onder i), genoemde Verdrag is opgericht, overeenkomstig de bepalingen betreffende de opening van aanvullende mogelijkheden voor het verlenen van administratieve diensten bij geschillen door het Secretariaat van het Centrum (hierna te noemen: Bepalingen inzake aanvullende mogelijkheden), indien de Verdragsluitende Partij van de investeerder of de Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, doch niet beide, partij is bij het ICSID-Verdrag;    

b. één scheidsman of een scheidsgerecht ad hoc, benoemd of ingesteld overeenkomstig de arbitrageprocedure van de VN-Commissie voor Internationaal Handelsrecht (UNCITRAL); of  

c. een scheidsrechterlijke procedure bij het Arbitrage-Instituut van de Kamer van Koophandel te Stockholm.     
5.  

a. De in het derde lid bedoelde toestemming alsook de in het vierde lid bedoelde schriftelijke toestemming van de investeerder moeten voldoen aan de vereisten voor: 

i. schriftelijke toestemming van de partijen bij een geschil in de zin van hoofdstuk II van het ICSID-Verdrag en in de zin van de bepalingen inzake aanvullende mogelijkheden; en  

ii. een „schriftelijke overeenkomst" in de zin van artikel II van het VN-Verdrag over de erkenning en tenuitvoerlegging van buitenlandse scheidsrechterlijke uitspraken, New York, 10 juni 1958 (hierna te noemen: „Verdrag van New York"); en  

iii. „de partijen bij een contract die een schriftelijke overeenkomst hebben gesloten" in de zin van artikel 1 van de UNCITRAL-arbitrageprocedure.    

b. Arbitrage overeenkomstig dit artikel vindt op verzoek van een partij bij het geschil plaats in een Staat die partij is bij het Verdrag van New York. De aldus voorgelegde geschillen worden voor de toepassing van artikel I van dat Verdrag geacht voort te vloeien uit een handelsrechtelijke betrekking of een handelstransactie.     
6.  Een overeenkomstig het vierde lid ingesteld scheidsgerecht beslist over de geschillen overeenkomstig dit Verdrag en de toepasselijke internationale rechtsregels en -beginselen.   
7.  Een investeerder, zijnde geen natuurlijke persoon, die op de datum van de in het vierde lid bedoelde schriftelijke instemming de nationaliteit heeft van een Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, en over wie investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij zeggenschap hebben voordat een geschil ontstaat tussen die investeerder en de eerstgenoemde Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt voor de toepassing van artikel 25, tweede lid, letter b), van het ICSID-Verdrag behandeld als een „onderdaan van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat" en voor de toepassing van artikel 1, zesde lid, van de Bepalingen inzake aanvullende mogelijkheden als een „onderdaan van een andere Staat".   
8.  Scheidsrechterlijke uitspraken, die de toekenning van rente kunnen omvatten, zijn definitief en bindend voor de partijen bij het geschil. Een scheidsrechterlijke uitspraak over een maatregel van een lagere overheid of instantie van de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij moet voorzien in de mogelijkheid dat die Verdragsluitende Partij een financiële schadevergoeding betaalt in plaats van een andere toegewezen compensatie. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij geeft onverwijld gevolg aan een dergelijke uitspraak en zorgt voor de doeltreffende tenuitvoerlegging van dergelijke uitspraken op haar grondgebied.   

### Artikel  27  

####Regeling van geschillen tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen streven ernaar geschillen over de toepassing of de uitlegging van dit Verdrag langs diplomatieke weg te regelen.   
2.  Wanneer het geschil niet binnen een redelijke termijn overeenkomstig het eerste lid geregeld is, kan elke Partij daarbij, tenzij anders bepaald in dit Verdrag of schriftelijk overeengekomen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen, en behoudens wat betreft de toepassing of interpretatie van artikel 6 of artikel 19 of, voor in bijlage IA vermelde Verdragsluitende Partijen, van de laatste zin van artikel 10, eerste lid, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de andere partij bij het geschil, de kwestie overeenkomstig dit artikel aan een scheidsgerecht ad hoc voorleggen.   
3.  Een dergelijk scheidsgerecht ad hoc wordt als volgt gevormd: 

a. De Verdragsluitende Partij die de procedure inleidt, benoemt binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid bedoelde schriftelijke kennisgeving van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij een lid van het scheidsgerecht en stelt de andere Verdragsluitende Partij daarvan in kennis;  

b. binnen 60 dagen na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid bedoelde schriftelijke kennisgeving benoemt de andere Verdragsluitende Partij bij het geschil eveneens een lid. Indien de benoeming niet binnen de voorgeschreven termijn geschiedt, kan de Verdragsluitende Partij die de procedure heeft ingeleid binnen 90 dagen na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid bedoelde schriftelijke kennisgeving verzoeken dat de benoeming plaatsvindt overeenkomstig letter d);  

c. Een derde lid, dat niet de nationaliteit of het staatsburgerschap mag hebben van een Verdragsluitende Partij die partij is bij het geschil, wordt benoemd door de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil. Dat lid wordt de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht. Indien de Verdragsluitende Partijen niet binnen 150 dagen na ontvangst van de in het tweede lid bedoelde kennisgeving overeenstemming bereiken over de benoeming van een derde lid, geschiedt de benoeming overeenkomstig letter d) op verzoek van een van beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, ingediend binnen 180 dagen na ontvangst van die kennisgeving;  

d. Benoemingen waarvan wordt verzocht dat zij worden verricht overeenkomstig deze letter, geschieden door de Secretaris-Generaal van het Permanente Hof van Internationale Arbitrage (PCIA) binnen 30 dagen na ontvangst van een verzoek daartoe. Indien hij verhinderd is zich van deze taak te kwijten, geschieden de benoemingen door de eerste Secretaris van het Bureau. Indien ook deze verhinderd is zich van deze taak te kwijten, geschieden de aanwijzingen door de plaatsvervanger met de hoogste anciënniteit.  

e. Bij benoemingen overeenkomstig de letters a tot en met d wordt rekening gehouden met de deskundigheid en ervaring, met name op de onder dit Verdrag vallende gebieden, van de te benoemen leden.  

f. Bij gebreke van een andersluidende overeenkomst tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn de arbitrageregels van de VN-Commissie voor Internationaal Handelsrecht (UNCITRAL) van toepassing, behoudens de wijzigingen die daarin zijn aangebracht door de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil of door de scheidsmannen. Het scheidsgerecht doet uitspraak met meerderheid van stemmen.  

g. Het scheidsgerecht beslist over het geschil overeenkomstig dit Verdrag en de toepasselijke regels en beginselen van het internationale recht.  

h. De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht is definitief en bindend voor de Verdragsluitende Partijen bij het geschil.  

i. Wanneer het scheidsgerecht in zijn uitspraak constateert dat een maatregel van een regionale of lokale overheid of instantie op het grondgebied van een in Deel I van bijlage P vermelde Verdragsluitende Partij niet in overeenstemming is met dit Verdrag, kan elk van beide partijen bij het geschil een beroep doen op de bepalingen van Deel II van bijlage P.  

j. De kosten van het scheidsgerecht, met inbegrip van de vergoedingen voor de leden, komen voor gelijke delen ten laste van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil. Het scheidsgerecht kan echter naar eigen goeddunken bepalen dat een groter aandeel in de kosten ten laste komt van één der Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil.  

k. Tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil anders overeenkomen, zetelt het scheidsgerecht in 's-Gravenhage en maakt het gebruik van de kantoren en faciliteiten van het Permanent Hof van Arbitrage.  

l. Een afschrift van de uitspraak wordt neergelegd bij het Secretariaat, dat dit ter algemene beschikking stelt.     

### Artikel  28  

####Niet-toepassing van artikel 27 op bepaalde geschillen

Een geschil tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de toepassing of uitlegging van artikel 5 of artikel 29 wordt niet volgens artikel 27 geregeld, tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil dit overeenkomen.  

### DEEL  VI  

####OVERGANGSBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  29  

####Voorlopige bepalingen inzake de met handel verband houdende aangelegenheden

1.  Zolang een of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen geen lid zijn van de WTO, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel van toepassing op de handel in energiegrondstoffen, energieproducten en uitrusting op energiegebied.   
2.  

a. De handel in energiegrondstoffen, energieproducten en uitrusting op energiegebied tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan ten minste één geen lid is van de WTO, wordt geregeld, behoudens het bepaalde onder letter b) en de uitzonderingen en voorschriften van bijlage W, door de bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst zoals deze worden toegepast en ten aanzien van energiegrondstoffen, energieproducten en uitrusting op energiegebied door de leden van de WTO onderling worden gehanteerd, alsof al die Verdragsluitende Partijen lid zijn van de WTO.  

b. De handel door een Verdragsluitende Partij die een staat is die deel uitmaakte van de voormalige Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken kan in plaats daarvan, behoudens de bepalingen van bijlage TFU, tot 1 december 1999 of totdat de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij tot de WTO wordt toegelaten, al naargelang wat het eerste plaatsvindt, door een overeenkomst tussen twee of meer van dergelijke staten worden geregeld.     
3.  

a. Elke Ondertekenende Partij bij dit Verdrag en elke staat of regionale organisatie voor economische integratie die voor 24 april 1998 tot dit Verdrag toetreedt, deponeert op de datum van ondertekening of van nederlegging van zijn akte van toetreding bij het Secretariaat een lijst van alle douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten op die datum worden geheven, met kennisgeving van de hoogte daarvan. Elke Ondertekenende Partij bij dit Verdrag en elke staat of regionale organisatie voor economische integratie die voor 24 april 1998 tot dit Verdrag toetreedt, deponeert op die datum bij het Secretariaat een lijst van alle douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer van uitrusting op energiegebied op die datum worden geheven, met kennisgeving van de hoogte daarvan.  

b. Elke staat of regionale organisatie voor economische integratie die voor of na 24 april 1998 tot dit Verdrag toetreedt, deponeert op de datum van nederlegging van zijn akte van toetreding bij het Secretariaat een lijst van alle douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer van energiegrondstoffen, energieproducten en uitrusting op energiegebied op die datum worden geheven met kennisgeving van de hoogte daarvan. Van alle wijzigingen van die douanerechten of andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer worden geheven, moet worden kennisgegeven aan het Secretariaat, dat de Verdragsluitende Partijen over die wijzigingen inlicht.     
4.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij streeft ernaar douanerechten of andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer worden geheven niet te verhogen: 

a. wat betreft de invoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten als vermeld in bijlage EM I of uitrusting op energiegebied als vermeld in bijlage EQ I en omschreven in Deel I van de in artikel II van de GATT 1994 bedoelde, op de Verdragsluitende Partij betrekking hebbende lijst, boven het in die lijst vermelde niveau, indien de Verdragsluitende Partij lid is van de WTO;  

b. wat betreft de uitvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten als vermeld in bijlage EM I of uitrusting op energiegebied als vermeld in bijlage EQ I en de invoer daarvan indien de Verdragsluitende Partij geen lid is van de WTO, boven het meest recent aan het Secretariaat kennisgegeven niveau, behalve wanneer dit is toegestaan krachtens de uit hoofde van het tweede lid, letter a), geldende bepalingen.     
5.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan een dergelijk douanerecht of andere heffing alleen dan boven het in het vierde lid bedoelde niveau verhogen indien: 

a. ingeval het een terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer geheven douanerecht of andere heffing betreft, een dergelijke handeling niet onverenigbaar is met de toepasselijke bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst, niet zijnde de in bijlage W genoemde bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst; of  

b. zij, in zo ruim mogelijke mate binnen de grenzen van haar wetgevingsprocedures, het Secretariaat in kennis heeft gesteld van haar voorstel voor een dergelijke verhoging, andere belanghebbende Verdragsluitende Partijen een redelijke gelegenheid heeft gegeven tot overleg over haar voorstel en eventuele opmerkingen van die Verdragsluitende Partijen in beschouwing heeft genomen.     
6.  Ten aanzien van handel tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan ten minste één geen lid is van de WTO, verhoogt die Verdragsluitende Partij geen douanerechten of andersoortige heffingen, welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer van energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten vermeld in bijlage EM II of van uitrusting op energiegebied vermeld in bijlage EQ II worden geheven, boven het laagste van de niveaus toegepast op de datum waarop de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest besluit de bedoelde post in de desbetreffende bijlage op te nemen. Een Verdragsluitende Partij mag een dergelijk douanerecht of andere heffing alleen dan boven dat niveau verhogen, indien: 

a. ingeval het een terzake van of in verband met de invoer geheven douanerecht of andere heffing betreft, een dergelijke handeling niet in strijd is met de toepasselijke bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst, niet zijnde de in bijlage W genoemde bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst; of  

b. in buitengewone omstandigheden die niet elders in dit Verdrag worden behandeld, de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest besluit een Verdragsluitende Partij te ontslaan van de haar anders uit hoofde van dit lid opgelegde verplichting en instemt met de verhoging van een douanerecht, afhankelijk van de voorwaarden die de Conferentie daaraan kan verbinden.     
7.  Onverminderd het zesde lid verhogen, in het geval van in dat lid bedoelde handel, de Verdragsluitende Partijen vermeld in bijlage BR wat betreft de in bijlage EM II opgenomen energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten, of in bijlage BRQ wat betreft de in bijlage EQ II opgenomen uitrusting op energiegebied, de douanerechten of andere heffingen niet boven het niveau voortvloeiend uit hun verplichtingen of de uit hoofde van de WTO-Overeenkomst voor hen geldende bepalingen.   
8.  Andere rechten en heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de in- of uitvoer van energiegrondstoffen, energieproducten of uitrusting op energiegebied worden geheven, zijn onderworpen aan de bepalingen van de Afspraak ten aanzien van de interpretatie van artikel II, eerste lid, letter b, van de GATT 1994 als gewijzigd overeenkomstig bijlage W.   
9.  bijlage D is van toepassing op: 

a. geschillen met betrekking tot het naleven van bepalingen die van toepassing zijn op handel bedoeld in dit artikel;  

b. geschillen met betrekking tot het toepassen door een Verdragsluitende Partij van maatregelen, al dan niet strijdig met de bepalingen van dit artikel, die volgens een andere Verdragsluitende Partij enig voordeel dat voor haar rechtstreeks of middellijk uit dit artikel voortvloeit teniet doen of aantasten; en  

c. tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn bij het geschil dit anders overeenkomen, geschillen met betrekking tot het naleven van artikel 5 tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan ten minste één geen lid is van de WTO,   met dien verstande dat bijlage D niet van toepassing is op geschillen tussen Verdragsluitende Partijen die in hoofdzaak rijzen in verband met een overeenkomst: 

i. waarvan kennis is gegeven overeenkomstig de andere eisen van het tweede lid, letter b), en van bijlage TFU, en die daaraan voldoet, of  

ii. waarbij een vrijhandelszone of een douane-unie wordt ingesteld als omschreven in artikel XXIV van de GATT 1994.     

### Artikel  30  

####Ontwikkelingen in internationale handelsregelingen

De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich ertoe, in het licht van de resultaten van de Uruguay-Ronde van multilaterale handelsbesprekingen zoals die hoofdzakelijk zijn neergelegd in de op 15 april 1994 te Marrakesh opgestelde Slotakte, uiterlijk op 1 juli 1995 of op de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, al naar gelang welk tijdstip later valt, te beginnen met het in overweging nemen van passende wijzigingen op dit Verdrag met het oog op aanneming daarvan door de Conferentie van het Handvest.  

### Artikel  31  

####Uitrusting op energiegebied

De voorlopige Conferentie van het Handvest maakt tijdens haar eerste vergadering een begin met het bestuderen van de opneming van uitrusting op energiegebied in de handelsbepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  32  

####Overgangsregelingen

1.  Gezien de tijd die nodig is om zich aan de eisen van een markteconomie aan te passen, kan een in bijlage T genoemde Verdragsluitende Partij, behoudens het bepaalde in het derde tot en met het zesde lid van dit artikel, de volledige nakoming van haar verplichtingen krachtens een of meer van de onderstaande bepalingen van dit Verdrag, tijdelijk opschorten: Artikel 6, tweede en vijfde lid Artikel 7, vierde lid Artikel 9, eerste lid Artikel 10, zevende lid – specifieke maatregelen Artikel 14, eerste lid, letter d – alleen wat betreft de overmaking van niet uitgegeven inkomsten Artikel 20, derde lid Artikel 22, eerste en derde lid   
2.  Andere Verdragsluitende Partijen verlenen een Verdragsluitende Partij die volledige nakoming overeenkomstig het eerste lid heeft opgeschort, bijstand om de voorwaarden te scheppen voor beëindiging van deze opschorting. Deze bijstand kan worden verleend in de vorm die zij het meest doeltreffend achten om te voorzien in de overeenkomstig het vierde lid, letter c, van dit artikel bekendgemaakte behoeften, indien nodig ook via bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten.   
3.  De toepasselijke bepalingen, de fases op de weg naar volledige uitvoering daarvan, de te nemen maatregelen en de datum waarop of, bij wijze van uitzondering, de omstandigheden als gevolg waarvan elke fase wordt beëindigd en de maatregel genomen, worden, voor elke Verdragsluitende Partij die zich beroept op overgangsregelingen, genoemd in bijlage T. Elk van deze Verdragsluitende Partijen neemt de genoemde maatregelen op de in die bijlage voor de desbetreffende bepaling en fase aangegeven datum. Verdragsluitende Partijen die overeenkomstig het eerste lid volledige nakoming tijdelijk hebben opgeschort, verbinden zich ertoe de relevante verplichtingen per 1 juli 2001 volledig na te komen. Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij het wegens uitzonderlijke omstandigheden nodig acht te verzoeken de duur van deze tijdelijke opschorting te verlengen of tot een voordien niet in bijlage T vermelde verdere tijdelijke opschorting te mogen overgaan, wordt de beslissing over een verzoek tot wijziging van bijlage T genomen door de Conferentie van het Handvest.   
4.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij die zich heeft beroepen op overgangsregelingen, stelt het Secretariaat ten minste eenmaal per twaalf maanden in kennis van : 

a. de uitvoering van in bijlage T genoemde maatregelen, en de algemene voortgang op de weg naar volledige nakoming;  

b. de voortgang die zij de volgende twaalf maanden denkt te maken op de weg naar volledige nakoming van haar verplichtingen, de problemen die zij voorziet en voorstellen voor een oplossing van die problemen;  

c. de behoefte aan technische bijstand ter vergemakkelijking van de voltooiing van de in bijlage T genoemde fases die nodig zijn voor de volledige uitvoering van dit Verdrag of om in letter b bedoelde problemen het hoofd te bieden, alsook om andere noodzakelijke marktgerichte hervormingen en de modernisering van haar energiesector te bevorderen;  

d. de eventuele noodzaak een verzoek als bedoeld in het derde lid te doen.     
5.  Het Secretariaat: 

a. zendt alle Verdragsluitende Partijen de in het vierde lid bedoelde kennisgevingen toe;  

b. zendt de in het tweede lid en het vierde lid, letter c, bedoelde verzoeken om en aanbiedingen van technische bijstand toe en bevordert actief de onderlinge afstemming van deze verzoeken en aanbiedingen, zo mogelijk met gebruikmaking van de binnen andere internationale organisaties bestaande regelingen;  

c. zendt alle Verdragsluitende Partijen aan het eind van elke periode van zes maanden een overzicht toe van alle kennisgevingen uit hoofde van het vierde lid, letter a of d.     
6.  De Conferentie van het Handvest evalueert jaarlijks de voortgang die de Verdragsluitende Partijen hebben gemaakt met de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit artikel alsmede de onderlinge afstemming van behoeften aan en aanbiedingen van technische bijstand als bedoeld in het tweede lid en het vierde lid, letter c. Bij die evaluatie kan zij besluiten passende maatregelen te nemen.

2.  Iedere Ondertekenende Partij bij het Handvest kan aan dergelijke onderhandelingen deelnemen.   
3.  Een Staat of een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie kan geen partij bij een protocol of verklaring worden, tenzij hij/zij Ondertekenende Partij bij het Handvest en Verdragsluitende Partij bij dit Verdrag is of dit tegelijkertijd wordt.   
4.  Behoudens het derde lid en het zesde lid, letter a, worden de slotbepalingen die van toepassing zijn op een protocol in dat protocol vastgesteld.   
5.  Een protocol is alleen van toepassing op de Verdragsluitende Partijen die zich daaraan gebonden verklaren en laat de rechten en verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen die geen partij bij het Protocol zijn, onverlet.   
6.  

a. Bij een protocol kunnen taken aan de Conferentie van het Handvest en functies aan het Secretariaat worden opgedragen, met dien verstande dat dit niet door middel van een wijziging van het protocol mag geschieden tenzij die wijziging wordt goedgekeurd door de Conferentie van het Handvest; deze goedkeuring is niet onderworpen aan krachtens het bepaalde in letter b) toegestane bepalingen van het protocol.  

b. Bij een protocol waarbij wordt voorzien in door de Conferentie van het Handvest te nemen beslissingen kan, behoudens het bepaalde in letter a, ten aanzien van deze beslissingen: 

i. een andere stemprocedure dan die van artikel 36 worden vastgesteld;  

ii. worden bepaald dat alleen partijen bij het protocol als Verdragsluitende Partijen in de zin van artikel 36 of als stemgerechtigd krachtens de voorschriften van het protocol worden beschouwd.

### DEEL  II  

### 1  

Wanneer het scheidsgerecht bij het vaststellen van een uitspraak van oordeel is dat een maatregel van een regionale of lokale overheid of instantie van een Verdragsluitende Partij (hierna „verantwoordelijke Partij" genoemd) niet in overeenstemming is met een bepaling van dit Verdrag, treft de verantwoordelijke Partij de in redelijkheid te verwachten maatregelen waarover zij beschikt om de naleving van het Verdrag met betrekking tot de maatregel te verzekeren.  

### 2  

De verantwoordelijke Partij meldt binnen 30 dagen aan het Secretariaat schriftelijk hoe zij denkt de naleving van het Verdrag met betrekking tot de maatregelen te verzekeren. Het Secretariaat legt deze kennisgeving voor aan de Conferentie van het Handvest zodra dit praktisch uitvoerbaar is, doch niet later dan bij de eerste bijeenkomst van de Conferentie van het Handvest na indiening van de kennisgeving. Wanneer onmiddellijke naleving niet uitvoerbaar of praktisch onuitvoerbaar is, wordt de verantwoordelijke Partij daartoe een redelijke termijn gegund. Deze termijn wordt vastgesteld door de twee partijen bij het geschil. Wanneer hierover geen overeenstemming kan worden bereikt, stelt de verantwoordelijke Partij een redelijke termijn ter goedkeuring door de Conferentie van het Handvest voor.  

### 3  

Wanneer de verantwoordelijke Partij niet binnen een redelijke termijn de naleving met betrekking tot de maatregel kan verzekeren, streeft zij op aanvraag van de andere Partij die partij is bij het geschil (hierna de „benadeelde Partij" genoemd) ernaar in overeenstemming met de benadeelde Partij een passende schadevergoeding vast te stellen als wederzijds bevredigende oplossing van het geschil.  

### 4  

Wanneer binnen 20 dagen na de aanvraag van de benadeelde Partij geen bevredigende schadevergoeding is overeengekomen, mag de benadeelde Partij, indien zij hiervoor de goedkeuring krijgt van de Conferentie van het Handvest, overgaan tot het opschorten van verplichtingen die zij jegens de verantwoordelijke Partij heeft en die zij beschouwt als gelijkwaardig aan de verplichtingen die jegens haar niet worden nagekomen ten gevolge van de maatregel waarop het geschil betrekking heeft, en wel totdat de Verdragsluitende Partijen hun geschil hebben weten op te lossen of de niet in overeenstemming zijnde maatregel in overeenstemming met het Verdrag is gebracht.  

### 5  

Bij het vaststellen van de op te schorten verplichtingen past de benadeelde Partij de volgende beginselen en procedures toe: 

a. De benadeelde Partij streeft ernaar eerst verplichtingen op te schorten die betrekking hebben op hetzelfde Deel van het Verdrag als dat ten aanzien waarvan het scheidsgerecht een schending heeft vastgesteld.  

b. Wanneer de benadeelde Partij van mening is dat het niet praktisch uitvoerbaar of doeltreffend is om verplichtingen uit hetzelfde Deel van het Verdrag op te schorten, kan zij een verzoek indienen om verplichtingen van andere Delen van het Verdrag op te schorten. Wanneer de benadeelde Partij besluit om een dergelijk verzoek tot het opschorten van verplichtingen in te dienen, geeft zij de redenen daarvoor aan in het verzoek aan de Conferentie van het Handvest.    

### 6  

Op schriftelijk verzoek van de verantwoordelijke Partij, in te dienen bij de benadeelde Partij en de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht dat de uitspraak heeft gedaan, stelt het scheidsgerecht vast of de mate waarin de benadeelde Partij verplichtingen heeft opgeschort excessief is, en zo ja in welke mate. Wanneer het scheidsgerecht niet opnieuw kan worden samengesteld, wordt deze vaststelling verricht door een of meer door de Secretaris-Generaal te benoemen arbiters. De vaststellingen overeenkomstig dit lid vinden plaats binnen 60 dagen na het verzoek aan het scheidsgerecht of de benoeming van arbiters door de Secretaris-Generaal. De verplichtingen mogen niet worden opgeschort zolang de vaststelling niet heeft plaatsgevonden; de vaststelling is definitief en bindend.  

### 7  

Bij het opschorten van verplichtingen jegens een verantwoordelijke Partij doet de benadeelde Partij al het mogelijke om de rechten krachtens het Verdrag van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen niet aan te tasten.

####Regels inzake de toepassing van de bepalingen van de WTO-overeenkomst

1. Bij gebrek aan een relevante interpretatie van de WTO-Overeenkomst, door de Ministeriële Conferentie of de Algemene Raad van de Wereldhandelsorganisatie krachtens artikel IX, tweede lid, van de WTO-Overeenkomst aangenomen met betrekking tot de uit hoofde van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), van toepassing zijnde bepalingen, kan de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest een interpretatie aannemen.  

2. Verzoeken om ontheffing uit hoofde van artikel 29, tweede lid, en zesde lid, letter b), worden voorgelegd aan de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest die bij de uitoefening van deze taken de procedures van artikel IX, derde en vierde lid, van de WTO-Overeenkomst volgt.  

3. In het kader van de WTO van kracht zijnde ontheffingen van verplichtingen worden voor de toepassing van artikel 29 geacht te gelden zolang zij in het kader van de WTO van kracht blijven.  

4. De bepalingen van artikel II van GATT 1994 die nog steeds worden toegepast worden, onverminderd artikel 29, vierde, vijfde en zevende lid, als volgt gewijzigd: 

i. Alle energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten vermeld in bijlage EM II en uitrusting op energiegebied vermeld in bijlage EQ II die worden ingevoerd uit of uitgevoerd naar een andere Verdragsluitende Partij zijn ook vrijgesteld van alle andere rechten of andersoortige heffingen welke terzake van of in verband met de invoer of uitvoer worden geheven en hoger zijn dan die welke op de datum van de in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, bedoelde standstill of krachtens artikel 29, zevende lid, gelden of hoger zijn dan die welke later bij of krachtens op de in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, bedoelde datum in het gebied van invoer of uitvoer van kracht zijnde wetten zouden moeten worden geheven.  

ii. Geen enkele bepaling van artikel II van GATT 1994 belet een Verdragsluitende Partij bij de invoer of uitvoer van enig artikel te eniger tijd te heffen: 

a. een heffing gelijkwaardig aan een binnenlandse belasting die overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het tweede lid van artikel III van GATT 1994 wordt geheven van het overeenkomstige binnenlandse product of van een product waaruit het geïmporteerde product geheel of gedeeltelijk is vervaardigd of geproduceerd;  

b. een antidumping- of compenserend recht toegepast overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel VI van GATT 1994;  

c. retributies of andere rechten evenredig aan de kosten van verleende diensten.    

iii. Een Verdragsluitende Partij mag niet haar methode voor het bepalen van de belastbare waarde of het omrekenen van valuta’s zodanig wijzigen, dat daardoor de waarde van de in artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid, vastgelegde standstill-verplichtingen wordt aangetast.  

iv. Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij, hetzij rechtens, hetzij in feite, een monopolie op de invoer of uitvoer van enige energiegrondstof of enig energieproduct vermeld in bijlage EM II of ten aanzien van de in bijlage EQ II vermelde uitrusting op energiegebied instelt, handhaaft of goedkeurt, mag dit monopolie niet ten gevolge hebben dat zulks gemiddeld een grotere mate van bescherming verschaft dan door de in artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid, bedoelde standstill-verplichting is toegestaan. Het bepaalde in dit lid legt de Verdragsluitende Partijen geen beperking op met betrekking tot enige vorm van steun aan binnenlandse producenten welke elders in dit Verdrag wordt toegestaan.  

v. Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij van oordeel is, dat een product van de zijde van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij niet een zodanige behandeling geniet als, naar de mening van de eerste Verdragsluitende Partij, is beoogd op grond van de in artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid, bedoelde standststill-verplichting, brengt zij de zaak terstond onder de aandacht van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij. Geeft de laatste toe dat de beoogde behandeling die is waarop de eerste Verdragsluitende Partij zegt recht te hebben, doch verklaart zij dat zulk een behandeling niet kan worden verleend, aangezien een rechtsprekend orgaan of ander bevoegd lichaam heeft beslist dat het betrokken product krachtens de tariefwetgeving van deze Verdragsluitende Partij niet zodanig kan worden ingedeeld dat een behandeling als in dit Verdrag bedoeld mogelijk is, dan treden de beide Verdragsluitende Partijen, tezamen met andere Verdragsluitende Partijen welke hierbij een aanmerkelijk belang hebben, terstond in nadere onderhandeling teneinde een billijke regeling te treffen welke in de plaats kan treden van de oorspronkelijk overeengekomene.  

vi. 

a. De specifieke rechten en heffingen welke zijn opgenomen in de Lijst van tarieven betrekking hebbende op de Verdragsluitende Partijen die lid zijn van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, en de preferentiële marges bij de specifieke rechten en heffingen welke door bedoelde Verdragsluitende Partijen worden toegepast, zijn in de desbetreffende valuta uitgedrukt tegen de pariwaarde welke op de datum van de in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, of krachtens artikel 29, zevende lid, bedoelde standstill door het Fonds is aangenomen of voorlopig erkend. Dientengevolge kunnen, ingeval deze pariwaarde overeenkomstig de Overeenkomst betreffende het Internationale Monetaire Fonds met meer dan twintig ten honderd wordt verminderd, deze specifieke rechten en heffingen en preferentiële marges aan zulk een vermindering worden aangepast, mits de Conferentie instemt met het feit dat zodanige aanpassingen de waarde van de in artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid, of elders in dit Verdrag bedoelde standstill-verplichting niet aantasten, rekening houdende met alle factoren die van invloed kunnen zijn op de noodzakelijkheid of de urgentie van zulke aanpassingen.  

b. Deze bepalingen zullen analoog van toepassing zijn op een Verdragsluitende Partij die geen lid van het Fonds is, van de dag af dat zij lid van het Fonds wordt of een speciale valuta-overeenkomst ingevolge artikel XV van GATT 1994 aangaat.    

vii. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij stelt het Secretariaat in kennis van alle douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen die van toepassing zijn op de datum van de in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, bedoelde standstill. Het Secretariaat houdt een Lijst van tarieven bij van de douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen die van belang zijn voor de standstill inzake douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen uit hoofde van artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid.    

5. Het besluit van 26 maart 1980 inzake de „Invoering van een losbladig systeem voor de lijsten van tariefconcessies” (BISD 27S/24) is niet van toepassing in het kader van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a). De toepasselijke bepalingen van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming betreffende de interpretatie van artikel II, eerste lid, letter b), van GATT 1994 zijn, onverminderd artikel 29, vierde, vijfde of zevende lid, van toepassing met de volgende wijzigingen: 

i. Met het oog op de doorzichtigheid van de wettelijke rechten en verplichtingen voortvloeiende uit het eerste lid, letter b), van artikel II van GATT 1994, worden de aard en het niveau van alle in die bepaling bedoelde „andere rechten of heffingen” die op de in- of uitvoer van alle energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten vermeld in bijlage EM II of uitrusting op energiegebied vermeld in bijlage EQ II worden geheven, vermeld in de Lijst van tarieven met de op de datum van de respectievelijk in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, of krachtens artikel 29, zevende lid, bedoelde standstill geldende niveaus naast de tariefpost waarop zij betrekking hebben. Overeengekomen wordt dat deze vermelding het wettelijk karakter van „andere rechten of heffingen” niet wijzigt.  

ii. Vermelding van „andere rechten of heffingen” vindt plaats voor alle energiegrondstoffen en energieproducten vermeld in bijlage EM II en uitrusting op energiegebied vermeld in bijlage EQ II.  

iii. Het staat elke Verdragsluitende Partij vrij om het bestaan van een „ander recht of andere heffing” te betwisten op grond van het feit dat een dergelijk „ander recht of andere heffing” op de datum van de in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, of de desbetreffende datum krachtens artikel 29, zevende lid, bedoelde standstill niet bestond voor de tariefpost in kwestie, alsmede op grond van de samenhang van het vermelde niveau van een „ander recht of andere heffing” met de in artikel 29, zesde of zevende lid, bedoelde standstill-verplichting, en wel gedurende een periode van een jaar na het van kracht worden van de wijziging van de met de handel verband houdende bepalingen van dit Verdrag, aangenomen door de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest op 24 april 1998, of een jaar na de kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat van het niveau van douanerechten en heffingen bedoeld in artikel 29, zesde lid, eerste zin, of artikel 29, zevende lid, indien die datum later valt.  

iv. De vermelding van „andere rechten of heffingen” in de Lijst van tarieven laat onverlet hun verenigbaarheid met andere rechten en verplichtingen uit hoofde van GATT 1994 dan die waarop punt iii) betrekking heeft. Alle Verdragsluitende Partijen behouden het recht de verenigbaarheid van een „ander recht of andere heffing” met die verplichtingen te allen tijde te betwisten.  

v. „Andere rechten of heffingen” die op een kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat zijn weggelaten, worden later niet aan die kennisgeving toegevoegd en „andere rechten of heffingen” waarvoor een lager niveau werd vermeld dan het bestaande op de toepasselijke datum worden niet tot dat niveau verhoogd, tenzij dergelijke toevoegingen of wijzigingen geschieden binnen zes maanden na de datum van kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat.    

6. Waar de WTO-Overeenkomst verwijst naar „in de lijst vermelde rechten” of naar „geconsolideerde rechten” wordt dit vervangen door „het niveau van krachtens artikel 29, vierde tot en met achtste lid, toegestane douanerechten en andersoortige heffingen”.  

7. Waar de WTO-Overeenkomst de datum van inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst (of een soortgelijke bewoording) als referentiedatum voor een actie vermeldt, wordt dit vervangen door de datum van inwerkingtreding van de wijziging van de met de handel verband houdende bepalingen van dit Verdrag, aangenomen door de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest op 24 april 1998.  

8. Met betrekking tot kennisgevingen vereist door de krachtens artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), toepasselijke bepalingen: 

a. doen de Verdragsluitende Partijen die geen lid zijn van de WTO hun kennisgevingen aan het Secretariaat. Het Secretariaat stuurt kopieën van de kennisgevingen aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen. Kennisgevingen aan het Secretariaat moeten gebeuren in één van de officiële talen van dit Verdrag. De begeleidende documenten mogen uitsluitend in de taal van de Verdragsluitende Partij zijn gesteld;  

b. gelden dergelijke eisen niet voor Verdragsluitende Partijen die ook lid zijn van de WTO die haar eigen eisen voor kennisgeving vaststelt.    

9. Waar artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), of zesde lid, letter b), van toepassing is, voert de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest alle toepasselijke taken uit die de WTO-Overeenkomst heeft toegewezen aan de in het kader van die Overeenkomst bevoegde instellingen.  

10. 

a. Interpretaties van de WTO-Overeenkomst aangenomen door de Ministeriële Conferentie of de Algemene Raad van de WTO krachtens artikel IX, tweede lid, van de WTO-Overeenkomst zijn van toepassing voorzover zij bepalingen interpreteren die van toepassing zijn uit hoofde van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a).  

b. Wijzigingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst op grond van artikel X van de WTO-Overeenkomst die bindend zijn voor alle leden van de WTO (andere dan die bedoeld in artikel X, negende lid) zijn, voorzover zij op grond van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), toepasselijke bepalingen wijzigen of daarop betrekking hebben, van toepassing tenzij een Verdragsluitende Partij de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest verzoekt een dergelijke wijziging niet-toepasselijk te verklaren of te veranderen. De Conferentie over het Energiehandvest besluit met een drie vierde meerderheid van de Verdragsluitende Partijen en stelt de datum van niet-toepasselijkheid of verandering van een dergelijke wijziging vast. Een verzoek om niet-toepasselijkheid of verandering van een dergelijke wijziging kan ook een verzoek omvatten om de toepassing van de wijziging op te schorten hangende het besluit van de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest. Een uit hoofde van dit lid tot de Conferentie over het Energiehandvest gericht verzoek wordt gedaan binnen zes maanden na verzending door het Secretariaat van een kennisgeving van het van kracht worden van de wijziging in het kader van de WTO-Overeenkomst.  

c. Interpretaties, wijzigingen of nieuwe instrumenten die door de WTO zijn aangenomen, andere dan de uit hoofde van de onder letter a) en letter b) toegepaste interpretaties en wijzigingen, zijn niet van toepassing.      

### 13  Bijlage TFU  

####Bepalingen betreffende handelsovereenkomsten tussen Staten die deel uitmaakten van de voormalige Sovjetunie (Overeenkomstig artikel 29, tweede lid, letter b))

### 1  

Overeenkomsten als bedoeld in artikel 29, tweede lid, letter b), worden schriftelijk aangemeld bij het Secretariaat door of namens alle partijen bij een dergelijke overeenkomst die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend of ertoe toetreden: 

a. wat betreft overeenkomsten die in werking treden drie maanden na de datum waarop de eerste partij haar akte van toetreding tot het Verdrag ondertekent of indient, uiterlijk zes maanden na die datum; en  

b. wat betreft overeenkomsten die in werking treden op een latere datum dan bedoeld bij letter a), op een zodanig tijdstip vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding dat andere staten of regionale organisaties voor economische integratie die het Verdrag hebben ondertekend of ertoe zijn toegetreden (verder „belanghebbende partijen" genoemd), redelijkerwijs de kans hebben om de overeenkomst te bestuderen en een eventueel protest daarover bij de partijen bij die overeenkomst en bij de Conferentie van het Handvest in te dienen alvorens zij in werking treedt.    

### 2  

De kennisgeving omvat: 

a. afschriften van de oorspronkelijke teksten van de overeenkomst in alle talen waarin zij is ondertekend;  

b. een beschrijving, door verwijzing naar de punten van bijlage EM, van de specifieke energiematerialen en energieprodukten waarop de overeenkomst van toepassing is;  

c. een verklaring voor elk van de relevante bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst die krachtens artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), van toepassing zijn, over de omstandigheden die het de partijen bij de overeenkomst onmogelijk of praktisch niet uitvoerbaar maken volledig te voldoen aan die bepaling;  

d. de specifieke maatregelen die door elk van de partijen bij de overeenkomst met betrekking tot de bij letter c) genoemde omstandigheden zullen worden getroffen; en  

e. een beschrijving van de programma's die de partijen zullen uitvoeren voor een geleidelijke vermindering en uiteindelijke intrekking van bepalingen die in strijd zijn met het onderhavige Verdrag.    

### 3  

De partijen bij een overeenkomstig het eerste lid aangemelde overeenkomst bieden de belanghebbende partijen een redelijke kans om over die overeenkomst met hen in overleg te treden en houden rekening met hun protesten. Op verzoek van een belanghebbende partij wordt de overeenkomst bestudeerd door de Conferentie van het Handvest, die daarover vervolgens aanbevelingen kan aannemen.  

### 4  

De Conferentie van het Handvest zorgt voor een periodieke evaluatie van de toepassing van overeenkomsten die krachtens het eerste lid zijn aangemeld en van de mate waarin vooruitgang is geboekt bij het intrekken van bepalingen daarvan die niet in overeenstemming zijn met bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst die van toepassing zijn geworden krachtens artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a). Op verzoek van een belanghebbende partij kan de Conferentie van het Handvest aanbevelingen aannemen over een dergelijke overeenkomst.  

### 5  

Een overeenkomst als beschreven in artikel 29, tweede lid, letter b) mag in geval van uitzonderlijke urgentie in werking treden voordat de in het eerste lid, letter b), het tweede lid en het derde lid voorgeschreven kennisgeving en overleg hebben plaatsgevonden, mits die kennisgeving alsnog plaatsvindt en onmiddellijk wordt voorzien in de mogelijkheid voor overleg. In een dergelijk geval geven de partijen bij de overeenkomst niettemin, overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letter a), onverwijld kennis van de tekst van de overeenkomst bij de inwerkingtreding ervan.  

### 6  

Verdragsluitende Partijen die partij zijn of worden bij een overeenkomst als beschreven in artikel 29, tweede lid, letter b), verbinden zich ertoe de mate waarin deze niet in overeenstemming is met de krachtens artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst te beperken tot hetgeen noodzakelijk is om rekening te houden met de bijzondere omstandigheden, en om een dergelijke overeenkomst zodanig ten uitvoer te leggen dat zo min mogelijk van die bepalingen wordt afgeweken.

a.  In hun onderlinge betrekkingen doen de Verdragsluitende Partijen al het mogelijke om door middel van samenwerking en overleg tot een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing te komen van elk geschil betreffende bestaande bepalingen dat concreet van invloed kan zijn op de naleving van de krachtens artikel 5 of artikel 29 op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen, of betreffende maatregelen die enig voordeel dat voor een Verdragsluitende Partij rechtstreeks of middellijk uit de krachtens artikel 29 op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen voortvloeit, kunnen teniet doen of uithollen   
b.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan een schriftelijk verzoek indienen bij elke andere Verdragsluitende Partij om overleg met betrekking tot elke bestaande maatregel van de andere Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan zij van mening is dat die concreet van invloed kan zijn op de naleving van de krachtens artikel 5 of artikel 29 op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen, of met betrekking tot maatregelen die enig voordeel dat voor een Verdragsluitende Partij rechtstreeks of middellijk uit de krachtens artikel 29 op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen voortvloeit, kunnen teniet doen of uithollen. Een Verdragsluitende Partij die om overleg verzoekt, geeft zo volledig mogelijk aan op welke maatregel de klacht betrekking heeft en welke bepalingen van artikel 5 of artikel 29 van de WTO-Overeenkomst zij relevant acht. Verzoeken om overleg overeenkomstig dit artikel worden aangemeld bij het Secretariaat, dat op gezette tijden de Verdragsluitende Partijen inlicht over lopend overleg waarvoor een kennisgeving heeft plaatsgevonden.   
c.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen behandelen alle vertrouwelijke en interne informatie die als zodanig is gekenmerkt en die is vervat in een schriftelijk verzoek of een antwoord daarop, dan wel is ontvangen in de loop van het overleg, op dezelfde wijze als de Verdragsluitende Partij die de informatie levert zou hebben gedaan.   
d.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen die deelnemen aan overleg of een andere vorm van geschillenbeslechting teneinde een oplossing te vinden voor een zaak die door een van de Verdragsluitende Partijen wordt beschouwd als een belemmering voor de naleving van de met de handel verband houdende bepalingen krachtens artikel 5 of artikel 29, of als een tenietdoen of uitholling van enig voordeel dat voor haar rechtstreeks of middellijk voortvloeit uit de krachtens artikel 29 op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen, doen al het mogelijke om een uitkomst te vermijden die de handel van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen nadelig beïnvloedt.   

### 2  

a.  Wanneer binnen 60 dagen na ontvangst van het in het eerste lid, letter b), bedoelde van het verzoek om overleg, de Verdragsluitende Partijen hun geschil niet hebben beslecht of niet zijn overeengekomen om het geschil door middel van overleg, bemiddeling, arbitrage of een andere methode te beslechten, kan elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen bij het Secretariaat een schriftelijk verzoek indienen voor het instellen van een panel overeenkomstig letter b) tot en met letter f). In haar verzoek geeft de verzoekende Verdragsluitende Partij aan wat de kern van het geschil is en welke bepalingen van artikel 5 of artikel 29 van de WTO-Overeenkomst relevant worden geacht. Het Secretariaat verstrekt alle Verdragsluitende Partijen onverwijld een afschrift van het verzoek.   
b.  Er wordt bij de beslechting van een geschil rekening gehouden met de belangen van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen. Andere Verdragsluitende Partijen die een wezenlijk belang hebben bij een zaak, hebben het recht door het panel te worden gehoord en er schriftelijke bijdragen bij in te dienen, op voorwaarde dat beide Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken, en het Secretariaat uiterlijk op de datum van het instellen van het panel, zoals vastgesteld overeenkomstig letter c), een schriftelijke uiteenzetting betreffende dit belang hebben ontvangen.   
c.  Panels worden geacht te zijn ingesteld 45 dagen na de ontvangst door het Secretariaat van het schriftelijk verzoek van de Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van letter a).   
d.  Panels worden samengesteld uit drie leden die door de Secretaris-Generaal uit de in het zevende lid beschreven rol worden gekozen. Tenzij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken anders overeenkomen, zijn de leden van het panel geen onderdaan van staten die als partij bij het geschil zijn betrokken of die overeenkomstig artikel 2, letter b), hun belang hebben kenbaar gemaakt, noch van staten die lid zijn van een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie die partij is bij het geschil of die overeenkomstig letter b) haar belang kenbaar heeft gemaakt.   
e.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken geven binnen tien werkdagen hun reactie op de benoeming van de panelleden en verzetten zich daartegen uitsluitend om dwingende redenen.   
f.  De panelleden nemen zitting in het panel op persoonlijke titel en nemen geen instructies aan van regeringen of andere lichamen, of verzoeken niet daarom. De Verdragsluitende Partijen verplichten zich ertoe deze beginselen te eerbiedigen en geen pogingen in het werk te stellen om de panelleden bij de uitoefening van hun taken te beïnvloeden. De panelleden worden zodanig uitgekozen dat hun onafhankelijkheid is gegarandeerd en dat in het panel een voldoende verscheidenheid van achtergrond en ervaring is vertegenwoordigd.   
g.  Het Secretariaat stelt onverwijld alle Verdragsluitende Partijen in kennis van de samenstelling van een panel.   

### 3  

a.  De Conferentie van het Handvest stelt een reglement van orde voor het panel vast dat in overeenstemming is met deze bijlage. Het reglement van orde dient zo nauw mogelijk aan te sluiten bij die van de WTO-Overeenkomst. Een panel heeft ook het recht aanvullende bepalingen op het reglement van orde vast te stellen, voor zover zij niet in tegenspraak zijn met het door de Conferentie van het Handvest vastgestelde reglement van orde of met deze bijlage. Bij de werkzaamheden van een panel hebben alle Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken en alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen die overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letter b), hun belang bij de zaak hebben aangemeld, het recht ten minste eenmaal te worden gehoord en om een schriftelijke bijdrage in te dienen. Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken hebben voorts het recht een schriftelijke weerlegging in te dienen. Een panel mag op verzoek van elke andere Verdragsluitende Partij die overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letter b), zijn belang heeft aangemeld, die partij inzage geven in alle schriftelijke stukken die zijn ingediend, voor zover de partij die ze heeft ingediend daarvoor toestemming heeft gegeven. De werkzaamheden van de panels zijn vertrouwelijk. Het panel geeft een objectieve beoordeling van de zaak die hem wordt voorgelegd, rekening houdend met de feitelijke gegevens met betrekking tot het geschil en de mate waarin maatregelen van invloed zijn op de naleving van de op de handel van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van artikel 5 of artikel 29. Bij de uitoefening van zijn functies treedt het panel in overleg met de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken en geeft hun voldoende gelegenheid om tot een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing te komen. Tenzij anders overeengekomen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken, baseert het panel zijn beslissing op de argumenten en ingediende bijdragen van de partijen. De panels laten zich leiden door de interpretaties die in het kader van de WTO-Overeenkomst aan de WTO-Overeenkomst worden gegeven en mogen de verenigbaarheid met artikel 5 of artikel 29 van praktijken die een Verdragsluitende Partij die lid is van de WTO, toepast ten aanzien van andere leden van de WTO op welke het de WTO-Overeenkomst toepast en die door de andere leden niet aan de WTO-geschillenbeslechting zijn onderworpen, niet ter discussie stellen. Tenzij anders overeengekomen door de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken, dienen alle procedures waarbij een panel is betrokken, met inbegrip van het opstellen van zijn eindverslag, te zijn voltooid binnen 180 dagen na het instellen van het panel; een eventuele overschrijding van deze periode doet echter geen afbreuk aan de geldigheid van het eindverslag.   
b.  Het panel stelt welk zijn rechtsbevoegdheid vast; deze beslissing is definitief en bindend. Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij die bij het geschil is betrokken aanvecht dat het geschil binnen het rechtsgebied van het panel valt, bestudeert het panel deze betwisting en spreekt zich erover uit of dit als een voorafgaand vraagstuk moet worden behandeld of moet worden toegevoegd aan de geschilpunten.   
c.  Wanneer twee verzoeken tot het instellen van een panel worden gedaan voor zaken die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn, kan de Secretaris-Generaal, met instemming van alle Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken, besluiten een enkel panel in te stellen.   

### 4  

a.  Na bestudering van alle weerleggingen dient het panel bij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken de beschrijvende delen in van zijn schriftelijk ontwerp-verslag, waarin onder andere alle feiten worden opgesomd en een samenvatting wordt gegeven van alle argumenten van de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen. De Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken wordt de mogelijkheid geboden binnen een door het panel vast te stellen periode schriftelijk te reageren op de beschrijvende delen van het ontwerp-verslag. Na afloop van de periode die het panel heeft vastgesteld voor het indienen van reacties door de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen, dient het panel bij de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken een tussentijds schriftelijk verslag in dat onder andere de beschrijvende delen en de door het panel voorgestelde bevindingen en conclusies bevat. Binnen een door het panel vast te stellen periode kan een bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij bij het panel een schriftelijk verzoek indienen om specifieke aspecten van het tussentijds verslag te herzien alvorens het eindverslag op te stellen. Alvorens het eindverslag in te dienen kan het panel naar eigen goeddunken in contact treden met de Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken om te overleggen over zaken die in een dergelijk verzoek aan de orde komen. Het eindverslag omvat de beschrijvende delen (waaronder een opsomming van de feiten en een samenvatting van de argumenten van de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen), de bevindingen van het panel en zijn conclusies, en een overzicht van de argumenten die over specifieke aspecten van het tussentijds verslag bij de bespreking daarvan naar voren zijn gebracht. Het eindverslag gaat in op alle wezenlijke zaken die het panel zijn voorgelegd en die nodig zijn om het geschil te beslechten, en vermeldt de redenen die het panel tot zijn besluit hebben doen komen. Het panel dient zijn eindverslag in door het onverwijld aan het Secretariaat en de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen te verstrekken. Het Secretariaat doet zo spoedig mogelijk het eindverslag, samen met alle schriftelijk ingediende standpunten die de bij het geschil betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen daaraan wensen toe te voegen, aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen toekomen.   
b.  Wanneer het panel tot de conclusie komt dat een maatregel die door een Verdragsluitende Partij wordt ingevoerd of wordt gehandhaafd niet in overeenstemming is met een bepaling van artikel 5 of artikel 29 of van een bepaling van de WTO-Overeenkomst, kan het panel in zijn eindverslag aanbevelen dat de Verdragsluitende Partij die maatregel wijzigt of intrekt teneinde aan die bepaling te voldoen.   
c.  De verslagen van het panel moeten door de Conferentie van het Handvest worden goedgekeurd. Om de Conferentie van het Handvest voldoende tijd te geven voor de bespreking van de panelverslagen, kunnen de verslagen pas minstens dertig dagen nadat het Secretariaat ze aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen heeft verstrekt, door de Conferentie van het Handvest worden goedgekeurd. De Verdragsluitende Partijen die bezwaren hebben tegen een panelverslag dienen hun bezwaren schriftelijk kenbaar te maken bij het Secretariaat ten minste tien dagen voor de datum waarop de Conferentie van het Handvest een besluit over de goedkeuring van het verslag moet nemen, en het Secretariaat geeft deze bezwaren onverwijld door aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen. De Verdragsluitende Partijen die bij het geschil zijn betrokken en de Verdragsluitende Partijen die hun belang in overeenstemming met het tweede lid, letter b), hebben aangemeld, hebben het recht volledig deel te nemen aan de bespreking van het panelverslag over dat geschil door de Conferentie van het Handvest, en hun standpunten worden volledig vastgelegd.   
d.  Teneinde een doeltreffende beslechting van geschillen tot voordeel van alle Verdragsluitende Partijen te verzekeren, is het van wezenlijk belang dat onverwijld gevolg wordt gegeven aan de uitspraken en aanbevelingen van een paneleindverslag dat door de Conferentie van het Handvest is goedgekeurd. Verdragsluitende Partijen tot wie een uitspraak of een aanbeveling van een door de Conferentie van het Handvest goedgekeurd paneleindverslag is gericht, delen de Conferentie van het Handvest mede hoe zij aan die uitspraak of aanbeveling denken te voldoen. Wanneer onmiddellijke naleving niet praktisch uitvoerbaar is, verstrekt de Verdragsluitende Partij de Conferentie van het Handvest een met redenen omklede verklaring daarvoor, en kan in dat geval rekenen op een redelijke termijn om te voldoen aan de uitspraak of aanbeveling. De geschillenbeslechtingsprocedure is gericht op het wijzigen of intrekken van onderling strijdige maatregelen.   

### 5  

a.  Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij niet binnen een redelijke termijn voldoet aan een uitspraak of aanbeveling van een door de Conferentie van het Handvest goedgekeurd paneleindverslag, kan een Verdragsluitende Partij die daarvan schade ondervindt bij de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij een schriftelijk verzoek indienen om onderhandelingen aan te gaan met het oog op het vaststellen van een wederzijds aanvaardbare schadevergoeding. De in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij gaat onverwijld in op een dergelijk verzoek tot het aangaan van onderhandelingen.   
b.  Wanneer de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij weigert te onderhandelen of indien de Verdragsluitende Partijen geen overeenstemming hebben bereikt binnen 30 dagen na het verzoek om de onderhandelingen te openen, mag de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij bij de Conferentie van het Handvest een schriftelijk verzoek indienen tot opschorting van haar verplichtingen krachtens artikel 5 of artikel 29 jegens de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij.   
c.  De Conferentie van het Handvest kan de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij toestaan de naleving op te schorten van haar verplichtingen jegens de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij uit hoofde van de bepalingen van artikel 5 of artikel 29, dan wel uit hoofde van de bepalingen van de WTO-Overeenkomst die krachtens artikel 29 van toepassing zijn, in de mate die de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij in deze omstandigheden als equivalent beschouwt.   
d.  De opschorting van verplichtingen is van tijdelijke aard en is alleen van toepassing tot de maatregel die in tegenspraak met artikel 5 of artikel 29 is bevonden, is ingetrokken, of tot een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing is gevonden.   

### 6  

a.  Alvorens over te gaan tot de opschorting van verplichtingen licht de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij in over de aard en de mate van de voorgestelde opschorting. Wanneer de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij bij de Secretaris-Generaal een schriftelijk bezwaarschrift indient betreffende de mate van opschorting van verplichtingen zoals voorgesteld door de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij, wordt het bezwaar onderworpen aan de hieronder beschreven arbitrageprocedure. De voorgestelde opschorting van verplichtingen wordt uitgesteld tot de arbitrage heeft plaatsgevonden en het arbitragepanel in overeenstemming met letter e) een definitieve en bindende uitspraak heeft gedaan.   
b.  De Secretaris-Generaal stelt overeenkomstig het tweede lid, letter d) tot en met letter f), een arbitragepanel samen dat, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, hetzelfde panel is dat de uitspraak of aanbeveling heeft gedaan waarnaar in het vierde lid, letter d) wordt verwezen, teneinde de mate van opschorting van verplichtingen die de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij voorstelt, te bestuderen. Tenzij de Conferentie van het Handvest anders beslist, wordt het reglement van orde voor panelwerkzaamheden overeenkomstig het derde lid, letter a), vastgesteld.   
c.  Het arbitragepanel stelt vast of en in welke mate de voorgestelde opschorting van verplichtingen door de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij excessief is in verhouding tot de geleden schade. Het panel spreekt zich niet uit over de aard van de opgeschorte verplichtingen, tenzij dit absoluut nodig is voor de vaststelling van de omvang van de opgeschorte verplichtingen.   
d.  Het arbitragepanel dient binnen 60 dagen na de instelling van het panel, dan wel binnen een door de benadeelde en de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij vrij vast te stellen termijn, een schriftelijke uitspraak in bij de benadeelde en de in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij en bij het Secretariaat. Het Secretariaat legt de uitspraak bij de eerste geschikte gelegenheid, doch uiterlijk op de eerste vergadering van de Conferentie van het Handvest na ontvangst van de uitspraak, voor aan de Conferentie van het Handvest.   
e.  De uitspraak van het arbitragepanel wordt definitief en bindend 30 dagen nadat zij is voorgelegd aan de Conferentie van het Handvest, waarna elke vorm van opschorting van verplichtingen die daardoor is toegestaan door de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij mag worden toegepast op de wijze die die Verdragsluitende Partij in de gegeven omstandigheden equivalent acht, tenzij de Conferentie van het Handvest binnen het verstrijken van de termijn van 30 dagen anders beslist.   
f.  Bij het opschorten van verplichtingen jegens een in gebreke blijvende Verdragsluitende Partij doet de benadeelde Verdragsluitende Partij al het mogelijke om de handel van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen niet nadelig te beïnvloeden.   

### 7  

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan twee personen benoemen, die, voor Verdragsluitende Partijen die lid zijn van de WTO, dezelfde personen zijn waarvan de namen voorkomen op de groslijst van regeringsfunctionarissen en anderen, bedoeld in artikel 8 van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming inzake de regels en procedures betreffende de beslechting van geschillen opgenomen in bijlage 2 bij de WTO-Overeenkomst of die in het verleden lid zijn geweest van een GATT- of WTO-panel ter beslechting van geschillen, voor zover deze personen in staat zijn en bereid zijn dienst te doen als leden van een panel als bedoeld in deze Bijlage. De Secretaris-Generaal kan ook, met goedkeuring van de Conferentie van het Handvest, maximaal tien personen benoemen die bereid zijn en geschikt zijn dienst te doen als panelleden ten behoeve van geschillenbeslechting overeenkomstig het tweede lid tot en met het vierde lid. De Conferentie van het Handvest kan daarnaast voor hetzelfde doel maximaal 20 personen benoemen die voorkomen op de rol van geschillenregelingspanels van andere internationale organisaties en die bereid en geschikt zijn om als panellid dienst te doen. De namen van al deze aldus benoemde personen vormen de geschillenregelingsrol. De personen worden uitsluitend op basis van objectiviteit, betrouwbaarheid en oordeelsvermogen benoemd en dienen over zoveel mogelijk ervaring te beschikken op het gebied van internationale handel en energie, inzonderheid met betrekking tot de bepalingen die krachtens artikel 29 van toepassing zijn. Bij het uitvoeren van hun taken in het kader van deze Bijlage dienen de panelleden niet gelieerd te zijn aan enige Verdragsluitende Partij, of daarvan instructies te ontvangen. De panelleden worden benoemd voor een hernieuwbare termijn van vijf jaar en totdat hun opvolgers zijn benoemd. Het panellid waarvan de termijn is verstreken, gaat door met het vervullen van de taken waarmee hij krachtens deze Bijlage is belast. Bij overlijden, opzegging of vastgestelde onbekwaamheid van een panellid kan de Verdragsluitende Partij of de Secretaris-Generaal die dat panellid heeft benoemd, voor de rest van de termijn van het panellid een andere persoon benoemen, waarbij geldt dat in het geval van een benoeming door de Secretaris-Generaal deze door de Conferentie van het Handvest moet worden goedgekeurd.  

### 8  

Onverlet de bepalingen van deze Bijlage worden de Verdragsluitende Partijen aangemoedigd gedurende de hele geschillenbeslechtingsprocedure met elkaar te blijven overleggen teneinde hun geschil bij te leggen.  

### 9  

De Conferentie van het Handvest kan andere lichamen of forums benoemen of aanwijzen voor het vervullen van de in deze Bijlage aan het Secretariaat en de Secretaris-Generaal gedelegeerde taken.  

### 10  

Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij zich beroept op artikel 29, negende lid, letter b), is deze bijlage van toepassing, met inachtneming van de volgende wijzigingen: 

a. de klagende partij dient een uitvoerige motivering in ter ondersteuning van een verzoek om overleg of om oprichting van een panel in verband met een maatregel die haars inziens enig voordeel dat voor haar rechtstreeks of middellijk uit artikel 29 voortvloeit, teniet doet of uitholt;  

b. wanneer wordt vastgesteld dat een maatregel uit artikel 29 voortvloeiende voordelen teniet doet of uitholt zonder dat artikel te schenden, bestaat er geen verplichting tot intrekking van de maatregel; in een dergelijk geval zal het panel evenwel aanbevelen dat de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij een voor beide partijen bevredigende vereffening uitvoert;  

c. het in het zesde lid, letter b., bedoelde arbitragepanel kan, op verzoek van één van de partijen, de omvang vaststellen van voordelen die zijn tenietgedaan of uitgehold en kan ook de middelen voorstellen om tot een wederzijds bevredigende vereffening te komen; dergelijke voorstellen zijn niet bindend voor de bij het geschil betrokken partijen.

###Artikel 6, tweede lid.

„Elke Verdragsluitende Partij zorgt ervoor dat zij binnen haar rechtsmacht de nodige wetten ter bestrijding van unilaterale en overeengekomen mededingingbeperkende gedragingen bij economische activiteit in de energiesector tot stand brengt en doet naleven." 
###Land: Albanië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving Er bestaat geen wet betreffende de bescherming van de mededinging in Albanië. De wet nr. 7746 van 28 juli 1993 betreffende koolwaterstoffen en de wet nr. 7796 van 17 februari 1994 betreffende mineralen bevatten geen bepalingen op dit gebied. Er bestaat geen wet betreffende elektriciteit, maar die bevindt zich wel in het voorbereidende stadium. Het is de bedoeling deze wet eind 1996 aan het Parlement voor te leggen. In deze wetten is Albanië van plan bepalingen over mededingingbeperkende gedragingen op te nemen. Uitfasering 1 januari 1998. 
###Land: Armenië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving In Armenië bestaat er thans een staatsmonopolie in de meeste energiesectoren. Er bestaat geen wet betreffende de bescherming van de mededinging en derhalve worden de regels voor de mededinging niet toegepast. Er zijn geen wetten betreffende energie. Het is de bedoeling de ontwerp-wetten betreffende energie in 1994 aan het Parlement voor te leggen. Er wordt overwogen in deze wetten bepalingen op te nemen betreffende oneerlijke mededinging, geharmoniseerd met de mededingingsregels van de EG. Uitfasering 31 december 1997. 
###Land: Azerbeidzjan

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving Er wordt thans gewerkt aan de voorbereiding van anti-monopolie-wetgeving. Einde van de uitfasering 1 januari 2000. 
###Land: Wit-Rusland

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving Er wordt thans gewerkt aan de voorbereiding van anti-monopolie-wetgeving. Uitfasering 1 januari 2000. 
###Land: Georgië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving De wetten betreffende het opheffen van monopolies bevinden zich thans in Georgië nog in het ontwikkelingsstadium, en daarom heeft de staat tot nu toe het monopolie voor vrijwel alle energiebronnen, hetgeen de mededinging in de energie- en brandstoffensector beperkt. Uitfasering 1 januari 1999. 
###Land: Kazachstan

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving De wet betreffende de ontwikkeling van de mededinging en de beperking van monopolistische activiteiten (nr. 656 van 11 juni 1991) is reeds goedgekeurd, maar is van algemene aard. Het is nodig wetgeving verder te ontwikkelen, met name door het aannemen van relevante amendementen of van een nieuwe wet. Uitfasering 1 januari 1998. 
###Land: Kirgizië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving De wet betreffende het anti-monopolie-beleid is reeds goedgekeurd. De overgangsperiode is nodig om de bepalingen van deze wet aan te passen aan de energiesector die thans nog strikt door de staat wordt gereglementeerd. Uitfasering 1 juli 2001. 
###Land: Moldavië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving De wet betreffende de beperking van monopolistische activiteiten en de bevordering van de mededinging van 29 januari 1992 voorziet in de organisatie van en de juridische grondslag voor de ontwikkeling van de mededinging en van maatregelen voor het verhinderen en beperken van monopolistische activiteiten; de wet is gericht op de totstandbrenging van vrije-markt-voorwaarden. De wet voorziet echter niet in concrete maatregelen ter bestrijding van oneerlijke mededinging in de energiesector, en voldoet niet volledig aan de eisen van artikel 6. In 1995 zal het Parlement een ontwerp worden voorgelegd van een wet betreffende de mededinging en van een staatsprogramma voor het opheffen van monopolies in de economie. De ontwerp-wet betreffende de energie die ook in 1995 aan het Parlement zal worden voorgelegd, zal eveneens ingaan op de opheffing van monopolies en de bevordering van mededinging in de energiesector. Uitfasering 1 januari 1998. 
###Land: Roemenië

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau Nationaal. Beschrijving De mededingingsregels worden nog niet toegepast in Roemenië. Er is een ontwerp-wet betreffende de bescherming van de mededinging voorgelegd aan het Parlement, die deze naar verwachting in 1994 zal goedkeuren. Het ontwerp bevat bepalingen met betrekking tot oneerlijke mededinging, geharmoniseerd met de mededingingsregels van de EG. Einde van de uitfasering 31 december 1996. 
###Land: De Russische Federatie

Sector Alle energiesectoren. Bestuursniveau De Federatie. Beschrijving In de Russische Federatie is een uitgebreid kader van anti-monopolie-wetgeving tot stand gebracht, maar er zullen verdere wettelijke en organisatorische maatregelen moeten worden genomen voor het verhinderen, beperken en wegnemen van monopolistische activiteiten en oneerlijke mededinging, met name in de energiesector. Uitfasering 1 juli 2001.

####Slotakte van de Conferentie van het Europees Energiehandvest

I. De laatste plenaire zitting van de Conferentie van het Europees Energiehandvest werd op 16 en 17 december 1994 gehouden te Lissabon. Vertegenwoordigers van de Republiek Albanië, de Republiek Armenië, Australië, de Republiek Oostenrijk, de Republiek Azerbeidzjan, België, de Republiek Wit-Rusland, de Republiek Bulgarije, Canada, de Republiek Kroatië, de Republiek Cyprus, de Tsjechische Republiek, het Koninkrijk Denemarken, de Republiek Estland, de Europese Gemeenschappen, de Republiek Finland, de Franse Republiek, de Republiek Georgië, de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland, de Helleense Republiek, de Republiek Hongarije, de Republiek IJsland, Ierland, de Italiaanse Republiek, Japan, de Republiek Kazachstan, de Republiek Kyrgyzstan, de Republiek Letland, het Prinsdom Liechtenstein, de Republiek Litouwen, het Groothertogdom Luxemburg, de Republiek Malta, de Republiek Moldavië, het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, het Koninkrijk Noorwegen, de Republiek Polen, de Portugese Republiek, Roemenië, de Russische Federatie, de Slowaakse Republiek, de Republiek Slovenië, het Koninkrijk Spanje, het Koninkrijk Zweden, de Zwitserse Confederatie, de Republiek Tadzjikistan, de Republiek Turkije, Turkmenistan, Oekraïne, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland, de Verenigde Staten van Amerika en Oezbekistan (hierna „de vertegenwoordigers" genoemd) namen aan de Conferentie deel, evenals waarnemers die door bepaalde landen en internationale organisaties op verzoek gezonden waren. 
###Achtergronden

II. Tijdens de Top van de Europese Raad in Dublin in juni 1990 opperde de eerste minister van Nederland het denkbeeld dat samenwerking in de energiesector zou kunnen fungeren als katalysator voor een sneller economisch herstel in Oost-Europa en de toenmalige Unie van Socialistische Sovjet-republieken. Dit idee werd verwelkomd door de Raad die de Commissie van de Europese Gemeenschappen dan ook uitnodigde te onderzoeken hoe een dergelijke samenwerking het beste tot stand zou kunnen worden gebracht. In februari 1991 werd daarop door de Commissie het plan voor een Europees Energiehandvest voorgesteld. Nadat het voorstel van de Commissie in de Raad van ministers van de Europese Gemeenschappen was besproken nodigden de Europese Gemeenschappen de andere landen van West- en Oost-Europa en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken, alsmede de niet-Europese leden van de Organisatie voor Economische Samenwerking en Ontwikkeling, uit in juli 1991 een conferentie bij te wonen in Brussel om een begin te maken met de onderhandelingen over een Europees Energiehandvest. Een aantal andere landen en internationale organisaties werd uitgenodigd om de Conferentie van het Europees Energiehandvest met de status van waarnemer bij te wonen. De onderhandelingen over het Europees Energiehandvest werden in 1991 afgesloten en het Handvest werd aangenomen toen op een op 16 en 17 december 1991 in Den Haag gehouden conferentie het desbetreffende Slotdocument werd ondertekend. Het Handvest werd op dat moment of in een later stadium ondertekend door alle landen die in afdeling I met name genoemd worden. De ondertekenaars van het Europees Energiehandvest hebben zich ertoe verbonden: 

– zich in te zetten voor de doelstellingen en beginselen van het Handvest en hun samenwerking zo snel mogelijk vorm te geven en uit te breiden door te goeder trouw te onderhandelen over een basisovereenkomst en de daarbij behorende protocollen.   De Conferentie van het Europees Energiehandvest begon derhalve met de onderhandelingen over een basisovereenkomst – later het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest genoemd – bestemd om de industriële samenwerking tussen Oost en West te bevorderen door wettelijke waarborgen in te stellen voor sectoren als investeringen, transito en handel. Zij maakte tevens een aanvang met onderhandelingen over protocollen betreffende de energie-efficiëntie, de nucleaire veiligheid en koolwaterstoffen, hoewel in het laatste geval de onderhandelingen in een later stadium werden opgeschort totdat het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest zou zijn voltooid. De onderhandelingen over het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest en het Protocol bij het Energiehandvest betreffende energie-efficiëntie en daarmee samenhangende milieu-aspecten werden in 1994 succesvol afgerond. 
###Het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest

III. Als gevolg van de beraadslagingen die door de Conferentie van het Europees Energiehandvest werden gehouden nam deze de tekst aan van het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest (hierna het „Verdrag" genoemd) dat is weergegeven in bijlage 1 en een aantal besluiten met betrekking daartoe, die zijn weergegeven in bijlage 2, terwijl voorts werd overeengekomen dat het Verdrag van 17 december 1994 tot 16 juni 1995 te Lissabon zou kunnen worden ondertekend. 
###Afspraken

IV. Door ondertekening van de Slotakte keurden de vertegenwoordigers met betrekking tot het Verdrag de volgende afspraken goed:  

### 1  

#### *Met betrekking tot het Verdrag in zijn geheel* 

a.  De vertegenwoordigers wijzen erop dat er bij de goedkeuring van de bepalingen van het Verdrag werd uitgegaan van de specifieke aard van het Verdrag dat erop gericht is een wettelijk kader te scheppen om een langdurige samenwerking in een speciale sector te bevorderen en dat deze als gevolg daarvan niet kunnen worden geïnterpreteerd als een precedent in de context van andere internationale onderhandelingen.   
b.  De bepalingen van het Verdrag: 

i. dwingen geen enkele Verdragsluitende Partij ertoe om een verplichte toegang van derden tot de netten in te voeren; noch  

ii. staan deze het gebruik van prijsstellingssystemen in de weg die ten aanzien van een bijzondere groep verbruikers identieke prijzen toepassen voor klanten op verschillende locaties.     
c.  Afwijkingen van een behandeling als meest begunstigde natie zijn niet bedoeld voor maatregelen die specifiek zijn voor een bepaalde investeerder of groep van investeerders, doch eerder bestemd om in het algemeen te worden toegepast.   

### 2  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 1, vijfde lid* 

a.  Overeengekomen wordt dat dit Verdrag geen rechten verleent op andere economische activiteiten dan economische activiteiten in de energiesector.   
b.  De volgende activiteiten zijn illustratief voor de economische activiteit in de energiesector: 

i. prospectie en exploratie alsmede winning van bij voorbeeld olie, gas, kolen en uranium;  

ii. constructie en exploitatie van installaties voor de opwekking van elektrische energie, met inbegrip van die welke worden aangedreven door wind en andere hernieuwbare energiebronnen;  

iii. transport over land, distributie, opslag van en bevoorrading met energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, bij voorbeeld via transmissie- en distributienetten en pijpleidingen of speciaal aangelegde spoorlijnen, alsmede de bouw van daarvoor bestemde installaties, met inbegrip van de aanleg van pijpleidingen voor olie, gas en kolenslik;  

iv. verwijdering van afval uit installaties voor de opwekking van energie zoals elektrische centrales, met inbegrip van radio-actief afval uit kerncentrales;  

v. de ontmanteling van installaties voor de opwekking van energie, met inbegrip van olieplatforms, olieraffinaderijen en elektrische centrales;  

vi. de marketing en verkoop van en handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, zoals de detailverkoop van benzine; en  

vii. activiteiten op het gebied van de research, consulting, planning, management en het ontwerpen in verband met de bovengenoemde activiteiten, met inbegrip van die welke erop gericht zijn om een efficiënt gebruik van energie te bevorderen.     

### 3  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 1, zesde lid* 

Ten behoeve van een grotere duidelijkheid over de vraag of een investering die in het gebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij direct of indirect wordt gecontroleerd door een investeerder van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, betekent zeggenschap over een investering een feitelijke controle die na onderzoek van de werkelijke omstandigheden in elke situatie bepaald wordt. Bij een dergelijk onderzoek dienen alle relevante factoren in ogenschouw te worden genomen, met inbegrip van 

a. de financiële belangen van de investeerder, met inbegrip van diens aandelenpakket in de betrokken investering;  

b. het vermogen van de investeerder om in belangrijke mate invloed uit te oefenen op het beheer en de exploitatie van de betrokken investering; en  

c. het vermogen van de investeerder om in belangrijke mate invloed uit te oefenen op de keuze van de leden van de Raad van bestuur of van andere bestuursorganen.   Voor zover er twijfels over bestaan of een investeerder direct of indirect controle uitoefent over een bepaalde investering, berust op een investeerder die aanspraak maakt op een dergelijke controle de bewijslast dat deze controle ook werkelijk bestaat.  

### 4  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 1, achtste lid* 

Overeenkomstig het buitenlandse investeringsbeleid van Australië wordt het opstarten van een nieuw mijnbouw- of grondstofverwerkend project in Australië met een totale investering van 10 miljoen Australische dollar of meer door een buitenlandse investeerder, beschouwd als een nieuwe investering, zelfs wanneer die buitenlandse investeerder reeds een soortgelijke onderneming in Australië exploiteert.  

### 5  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 1, twaalfde lid* 

De afgevaardigden erkennen de noodzaak voor een juiste en efficiënte bescherming van de rechten op het gebied van de intellectuele eigendom overeenkomstig de strengste internationaal aanvaarde normen.  

### 6  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 5, eerste lid* 

De overeenstemming die door de vertegenwoordigers werd bereikt met betrekking tot artikel 5 betekent niet dat er een standpunt wordt ingenomen met betrekking tot de vraag of dan wel in hoeverre de bepalingen van de „overeenkomst betreffende de met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregelen" die aan de Slotakte van de Uruguay Ronde van multilaterale handelsbesprekingen zijn gehecht, besloten liggen in de artikelen III en XI van de GATT.  

### 7  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 6* 

a.  De unilaterale en overeengekomen mededingingremmende gedragingen waarvan sprake is in artikel 6, tweede lid, dienen door iedere Verdragsluitende Partij te worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig de geldende wetten en kunnen misbruiken bij de exploitatie omvatten.   
b.  „Handhavingsmaatregelen" en „nalevingsprocedures" kunnen worden uitgevoerd op grond van de mededingingswetten van een Verdragsluitende Partij via onderzoek, wettelijke maatregelen of administratieve acties, alsmede via besluiten of andere wettelijke maatregelen op grond waarvan toestemming verleend wordt of blijft.   

### 8  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 7, vierde lid* 

De toepasselijke wetgeving kan bepalingen omvatten met betrekking tot milieubescherming, grondgebruik, veiligheid of technische normen.  

### 9  

#### *Ten aanzien van de artikelen 9 en 10 en Deel V* 

Aangezien de programma's van een Verdragsluitende Partij waarin openbare leningen, subsidies, garanties of waarborgen voor het vergemakkelijken van de handel of van investeringen in andere landen worden vastgesteld, geen verband houden met investeringen of daarmee verwante activiteiten van investeerders uit andere Verdragsluitende Partijen in de regio van eerstgenoemde partij, kunnen er voor dergelijke programma's beperkingen gelden ten aanzien van de deelneming daaraan.  

### 10  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 10, vierde lid* 

In het aanvullend verdrag zullen de voorwaarden worden vastgelegd voor de toepassing van de in artikel 10, derde lid, genoemde behandeling. Deze voorwaarden zullen onder meer bepalingen omvatten met betrekking tot het verkopen of het op andere wijze afstand doen van overheidsbedrijven (aankopen privatisering) en het ontmantelen van monopolies (demonopolisering).  

### 11  

#### *Ten aanzien van de artikelen 10, vierde lid, en 29, zesde lid* 

De Verdragsluitende Partijen mogen iedere samenhang zien tussen de bepalingen van artikel 10, vierde lid, en artikel 29, zesde lid.  

### 12  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 14, vijfde lid* 

Het is de bedoeling dat een Verdragsluitende Partij die toetreedt tot een overeenkomst als bedoeld in artikel 14, vijfde lid, de garantie geeft dat de voorwaarden van een dergelijke overeenkomst niet in tegenspraak zijn met de verplichtingen van die Verdragsluitende Partij krachtens de Artikelen van Overeenkomst van het Internationaal Monetair Fonds.  

### 13  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 19, eerste lid, letter i)* 

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij mag besluiten in hoeverre de beoordeling en controle op milieu-effecten dient te zijn onderworpen aan wettelijke eisen, welke autoriteiten bevoegd zijn om besluiten te nemen in verband met dat soort eisen en welke passende procedures daarbij gevolgd moeten worden.  

### 14  

#### *Ten aanzien van de artikelen 22 en 23* 

Met betrekking tot de onder artikel 29 vallende handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, zijn in dat artikel de bepalingen opgenomen die gelden ten aanzien van de inhoud van de artikelen 22 en 23.  

### 15  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 24* 

Uitzonderingen die vervat zijn in de GATT en bijbehorende instrumenten zijn van toepassing tussen individuele Verdragsluitende Partijen die tevens partij zijn bij de GATT, zoals in artikel 4 bepaald is. Met betrekking tot de onder artikel 29 vallende handel in energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten, zijn in dat artikel de bepalingen opgenomen die gelden ten aanzien van de inhoud van artikel 24.  

### 16  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 26, tweede lid, letter a)* 

Artikel 26, tweede lid, letter a), moet niet worden geïnterpreteerd in de zin dat een Verdragsluitende Partij verzocht wordt Deel III van het Verdrag in het nationale recht op te nemen.  

### 17  

#### *Ten aanzien van de artikelen 26 en 27* 

De verwijzing naar in het kader van verdragen aangegane verplichtingen in de voorlaatste zin van artikel 10, eerste lid, omvat geen besluiten die genomen werden door internationale organisaties, zelfs indien deze juridisch bindend zijn, of verdragen die vóór 1 januari 1970 van kracht zijn geworden.  

### 18  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a)* 

a.  Indien een bepaling uit de GATT 1947 of een bijbehorend instrument waarnaar in deze alinea wordt verwezen inhoudt dat er gezamenlijk actie wordt ondernomen door de Partijen bij de GATT is het de bedoeling dat dit door de Conferentie van het Handvest wordt gedaan.   
b.  De zinsnede „die op 1 maart 1994 van kracht zijn en ten aanzien van energiegrondstoffen en energieprodukten door de Partijen bij de GATT onderling worden toegepast" is niet bedoeld als een verwijzing naar gevallen waarbij een Partij bij de GATT een beroep heeft gedaan op artikel XXXV van de GATT, waarbij de GATT niet meer van toepassing is ten overstaan van een andere partij bij de GATT, doch past niettemin unilateraal op een de facto-basis sommige bepalingen van de GATT toe ten opzichte van die andere Partij bij de GATT.   

### 19  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 33* 

De voorlopige Conferentie van het Handvest moet zo spoedig mogelijk een besluit nemen over de wijze waarop het doel van titel III van het Europese Energiehandvest kan worden bereikt dat er moet worden onderhandeld over protocols in samenwerkingsgebieden zoals die welke in titel III van het Handvest genoemd worden.  

### 20  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 34* 

a.  De voorlopige Secretaris-Generaal dient onmiddellijk contact op te nemen met andere internationale organisaties ten einde te weten te komen op welke voorwaarden deze bereid zouden zijn om taken op zich te nemen die uit het Verdrag en het Handvest voortvloeien. De voorlopige Secretaris-Generaal zou hierover kunnen rapporteren aan de voorlopige Conferentie van het Handvest op de vergadering die volgens artikel 45, vierde lid, binnen 180 dagen na de openingsdatum voor de ondertekening van het Verdrag zou moeten worden bijeengeroepen.   
b.  De Conferentie van het Handvest dient de jaarlijkse begroting vast te stellen vóór het begin van het financieel jaar.   

### 21  

#### *Ten aanzien van artikel 34, derde lid, letter m)* 

De technische wijzigingen in bijlagen kunnen bij voorbeeld betrekking hebben op het afvoeren van landen die niet hebben ondertekend of die na ondertekening het voornemen kenbaar hebben gemaakt niet tot ratificering over te gaan, of op aanvullingen op de bijlagen N en VC. Het is de bedoeling dat het Secretariaat in voorkomend geval dergelijke wijzigingen voorstelt aan de Conferentie van het Handvest.  

### 22  

#### *Ten aanzien van bijlage TFU, eerste lid* 

a.  Indien sommige partijen bij een overeenkomst die in het eerste lid worden genoemd binnen de voor kennisgeving vereiste termijn het Verdrag niet hebben ondertekend of daartoe zijn toegetreden, kunnen die partijen bij de overeenkomst die het Verdrag reeds hebben ondertekend of daartoe zijn toegetreden namens hen de kennisgeving verrichten.   
b.  De algemene noodzaak om kennis te geven van overeenkomsten van zuiver commerciële aard werd niet vastgesteld omdat bij dergelijke overeenkomsten geen probleem zou ontstaan met betrekking tot de naleving van artikel 29, tweede lid, letter a), zelfs indien deze door overheidsbedrijven worden gesloten. De Conferentie van het Handvest zou evenwel met het oog op bijlage TFU kunnen verduidelijken bij welke soorten van de in artikel 29, tweede lid, letter b) genoemde overeenkomsten kennisgeving op grond van de bijlage noodzakelijk is en bij welke dit niet het geval is.   

###Verklaringen

V. De vertegenwoordigers verklaarden dat artikel 18, tweede lid, niet moet worden geïnterpreteerd als een mogelijkheid om de andere bepalingen van het Verdrag niet te hoeven toe te passen. VI. De vertegenwoordigers vestigden de aandacht op de volgende verklaringen die met betrekking tot het Verdrag werden afgelegd: 

1.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 1, zesde lid*  De Russische Federatie zou willen dat opnieuw wordt bekeken bij de onderhandelingen met betrekking tot het in artikel 10, vierde lid, genoemde aanvullend verdrag, welk belang moet worden gehecht aan nationale wetgeving met betrekking tot de kwestie van de controle als vermeld in de afspraak bij artikel 1, zesde lid.  

2.  *Ten aanzien van de artikelen 5 en 10, elfde lid*  Australië wijst erop dat de bepalingen van de artikelen 5 en 10, elfde lid, geen afbreuk doen aan zijn rechten en verplichtingen uit hoofde van het GATT, met inbegrip van die welke zijn uitgewerkt in de uit de Uruguay-Ronde voortgekomen Overeenkomst inzake de met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregelen, met name wat betreft de lijst van uitzonderingen in artikel 5, derde lid, die Australië onvolledig acht. Australië wijst er voorts op dat ingevolge het Verdrag ingestelde organen voor geschillenbeslechting geen interpretaties zouden moeten geven van de artikelen III en XI van het GATT in het kader van geschillen tussen partijen bij het GATT of tussen een investeerder van een partij bij het GATT en een andere partij bij het GATT. Australië is van oordeel dat ten aanzien van de toepassing van artikel 10, elfde lid, tussen een investeerder en een partij bij het GATT, de enige kwestie die op grond van artikel 26 kan worden bestudeerd, de kwestie van de arbitrale uitspraken is, ingeval een GATT-panel of het orgaan voor geschillenbeslechting van de WTO eerst vaststelt dat een door de Verdragsluitende Parij gehandhaafde met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregel onverenigbaar is met haar verplichtingen uit hoofde van het GATT of de Overeenkomst inzake de met de handel verband houdende investeringsmaatregelen.  

3.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 7*  De Europese Gemeenschappen en hun Lid-Staten alsmede Oostenrijk, Noorwegen, Zweden en Finland verklaren dat de bepalingen van artikel 7 onderworpen zijn aan de conventionele regels uit het internationaal recht betreffende de jurisdictie over onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen of, indien dergelijke regels ontbreken, aan het algemene internationaal recht. Zij verklaren voorts dat artikel 7 niet bedoeld is om de interpretatie van de bestaande internationale wetgeving met betrekking tot de jurisdictie over onderzeese kabels en pijpleidingen te beïnvloeden, en ook niet als zodanig kan worden beschouwd.  

4.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 10*  Canada en de Verenigde Staten bevestigen beide dat zij de bepalingen van artikel 10 zullen toepassen met inachtneming van het volgende: Om de behandeling te kunnen evalueren die aan investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen en hun investeringen dient te worden gegeven, zullen de omstandigheden geval per geval moeten worden bekeken. Een vergelijking tussen de behandeling die wordt gegeven aan investeerders van een bepaalde Verdragsluitende Partij, of de investeringen van investeerders van een bepaalde Verdragsluitende Partij en de investeringen of investeerders van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij, kan alleen worden gemaakt indien hierbij van dezelfde omstandigheden wordt uitgegaan. Bij de vaststelling of een verschillende behandeling van investeerders of investeringen verenigbaar is met artikel 10, moeten twee fundamentele factoren in aanmerking worden genomen. De eerste factor wordt gevormd door de beleidsdoelstellingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen op verschillende terreinen voor zover deze verenigbaar zijn met de principes van niet-discriminatie die in artikel 10 uiteen worden gezet. Gewettigde beleidsdoelstellingen kunnen een verschillende behandeling van buitenlandse investeerders of van hun investeringen rechtvaardigen om zodoende de ongelijkheid te weerspiegelen van de relevante omstandigheden tussen deze investeerders en hun investeringen enerzijds en hun nationale tegenhangers anderzijds. De doelstelling om de integriteit van het financieel systeem van een land te garanderen zou bij voorbeeld redelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen rechtvaardigen met betrekking tot buitenlandse investeerders of investeringen, terwijl dergelijke maatregelen niet noodzakelijk zouden zijn om dezelfde doelstellingen te bereiken wanneer het nationale investeerders of investeringen betreft. Deze buitenlandse investeerders of hun investeringen zouden derhalve, vergeleken met nationale investeerders of hun investeringen, „in identieke omstandigheden" verkeren. Zelfs indien een dergelijke maatregel een verschillende behandeling mogelijk zou maken, zou hij niet in tegenspraak zijn met artikel 10. De tweede factor is de mate waarin de maatregel wordt gemotiveerd door het feit dat de betrokken investeerder of investering buitenlands eigendom is of onder buitenlandse controle staat. Een maatregel die specifiek gericht is op investeerders omdat zij buitenlands zijn, zonder dat er beleidsmatig gezien voldoende redenen voorhanden zijn die met de voorgaande alinea kunnen worden verenigd, zou in tegenspraak zijn met de beginselen van artikel 10. De buitenlandse investeerder of investering zou „in identieke omstandigheden" verkeren als nationale investeerders en hun investeringen, en de maatregel zou dus in tegenspraak zijn met artikel 10.  

5.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 25*  De Europese Gemeenschappen en hun Lid-Staten wijzen erop dat overeenkomstig artikel 58 van het Verdrag tot oprichting van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap: 

a. de vennootschappen welke in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van een Lid-Staat zijn opgericht en welke hun statutaire zetel, hun hoofdbestuur of hun hoofdvestiging binnen de Gemeenschap hebben, worden voor het recht van vestiging overeenkomstig Deel drie, titel III, hoofdstuk 2, van het Verdrag tot oprichting van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, gelijkgesteld met de natuurlijke personen die onderdanen zijn van de Lid-Staten; vennootschappen welke uitsluitend hun hoofdvestiging binnen de Gemeenschap hebben dienen, voor dit doel, een daadwerkelijke en permanente band te hebben met de economie van één van de Lid-Staten;  

b. onder „vennootschappen" worden verstaan maatschappen naar burgerlijk recht of handelsrecht, de coöperatieve verenigingen of vennootschappen daaronder begrepen, en de overige rechtspersonen naar publiek- of privaat recht, met uitzondering van vennootschappen welke geen winst beogen.   De Europese Gemeenschappen en hun Lid-Staten wijzen er verder op dat: Het communautair recht de mogelijkheid verschaft om de hierboven omschreven behandeling uit te breiden tot filialen en agentschappen van vennootschappen die niet in één van de Lid-Staten gevestigd zijn; en voorts dat de toepassing van artikel 25 van het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest uitsluitend die afwijkingen mogelijk zal maken die noodzakelijk zijn om de voorkeursbehandeling te vrijwaren die een gevolg is van het voortgaande proces van economische integratie dat voortvloeit uit de Verdragen tot oprichting van de Europese Gemeenschappen.  

6.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 40*  Denemarken wijst erop dat het Europese Energiehandvest niet van toepassing is op Groenland en de Faeröer-eilanden zolang daarover geen mededeling is ontvangen van de plaatselijke regeringen van Groenland en de Faeröer-eilanden. Met betrekking hiertoe bevestigt Denemarken dat artikel 40 van het Verdrag van toepassing is op Groenland en de Faeröer-eilanden.  

7.  *Ten aanzien van bijlage G (4)*  

a. De Europese Gemeenschap en de Russische Federatie verklaren dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen tot aan het moment waarop zij een andere overeenkomst zullen sluiten de bepalingen van toepassing zijn van artikel 22 van de op 24 juni 1994 te Korfoe ondertekende Partnerschaps- en Samenwerkingsovereenkomst waarbij een partnerschap tot stand wordt gebracht tussen de Europese Gemeenschappen en hun Lid-Staten, enerzijds, en de Russische Federatie, anderzijds, alsmede de daaraan gehechte briefwisseling en de desbetreffende gemeenschappelijke verklaring, terwijl voor geschillen met betrekking tot deze handel de procedures van de genoemde Overeenkomst zullen gelden.  

b. De Europese Gemeenschappen en de Oekraïne verklaren in overeenstemming met de op 14 juni 1994 te Luxemburg ondertekende Partnerschaps- en Samenwerkingsovereenkomst en de daarbijbehorende, eveneens op dezelfde dag te Luxemburg geparafeerde, Interim-Overeenkomst, dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen de bepalingen van een tussen de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Oekraïne te sluiten specifieke overeenkomst uitsluitend van toepassing zullen zijn. Tot de inwerkingtreding van die specifieke Overeenkomst, zullen de bepalingen van de op 18 december 1989 te Brussel ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken uitsluitend van toepassing blijven voor hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen.  

c. De Europese Gemeenschappen en Kazachstan verklaren in overeenstemming met de op 20 mei 1994 te Brussel geparafeerde Partnerschaps- en Samenwerkingsovereenkomst, dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen de bepalingen van een tussen de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en Kazachstan te sluiten specifieke overeenkomst uitsluitend van toepassing zullen zijn. Tot de inwerkingtreding van die specifieke Overeenkomst, zullen de bepalingen van de op 18 december 1989 te Brussel ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken uitsluitend van toepassing blijven voor hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen.  

d. De Europese Gemeenschappen en Kirgizië verklaren in overeenstemming met de op 31 mei 1994 te Brussel geparafeerde Partnerschaps- en Samenwerkingsovereenkomst, dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen de bepalingen van een tussen de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en Kirgizië te sluiten specifieke overeenkomst uitsluitend van toepassing zullen zijn. Tot de inwerkingtreding van die specifieke Overeenkomst, zullen de bepalingen van de op 18 december 1989 te Brussel ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken uitsluitend van toepassing blijven voor hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen.  

e. De Europese Gemeenschappen en Tadzjikistan verklaren dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen de bepalingen van een tussen de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en Kirgizië te sluiten specifieke overeenkomst uitsluitend van toepassing zullen zijn. Tot de inwerkingtreding van die specifieke Overeenkomst, zullen de bepalingen van de op 18 december 1989 te Brussel ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken uitsluitend van toepassing blijven voor hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen.  

f. De Europese Gemeenschappen en Oezbekistan verklaren dat op hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen de bepalingen van een tussen de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en Oezbekistan te sluiten specifieke overeenkomst uitsluitend van toepassing zullen zijn. Tot de inwerkingtreding van die specifieke Overeenkomst, zullen de bepalingen van de op 18 december 1989 te Brussel ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, de Europese Gemeenschap voor Atoomenergie en de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken uitsluitend van toepassing blijven voor hun onderlinge handel in kernmaterialen.

### Bijlage  2  

####Besluiten met betrekking tot het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest

De Conferentie heeft de volgende besluiten goedgekeurd: 

1.  *Ten aanzien van het Verdrag als geheel*  In geval van strijdigheid tussen het Verdrag inzake Spitsbergen van 9 februari 1920 (het Svalbardverdrag) en het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest, prevaleert het Verdrag inzake Spitsbergen wat het punt van strijdigheid betreft, onverminderd de positie van de Verdragsluitende Partijen ten aanzien van het Svalbardverdrag. In geval van een dergelijke strijdigheid of van een geschil over de vraag of dan wel in hoeverre er sprake is van een dergelijke strijdigheid, zijn artikel 16 en Deel V van het Verdrag inzake het Energiehandvest niet van toepassing.  

2.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 10, zevende lid*  De Russische Federatie kan eisen dat firma's waarin door buitenlands kapitaal wordt deelgenomen, wettelijke toestemming verkrijgen voor het verhuur van federale eigendommen, mits de Russische Federatie zonder uitzondering de garantie verstrekt dat deze procedure niet wordt toegepast op een wijze die discriminerend is ten opzichte van de investeringen van investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

3.  *Ten opzichte van artikel 14*  <sup> 1)  * Dit besluit is opgesteld met dien verstande dat Verdragsluitende Partijen die daarvan gebruik willen maken en die tevens Partnerschaps- en Samenwerkingsovereenkomsten zijn aangegaan met de Europese Gemeenschappen en hun Lid-Staten welke een artikel bevatten waardoor deze eerder gesloten overeenkomsten door het Verdrag buiten werking worden gesteld, intentieverklaringen uitwisselen die het wettelijk effect hebben dat artikel 16 van het Verdrag met betrekking tot dit besluit op hen van toepassing wordt. De uitwisseling van deze verklaringen dient vóór de ondertekening te hebben plaatsgevonden.  </sup> 

1. De term „het vrij verrichten van transfers" in artikel 14, eerste lid, vormt geen belemmering voor een Verdragsluitende Partij (hierna „beperkende partij" genoemd) om beperkingen toe te passen op het verkeer van kapitaal door de eigen investeerders, mits: 

a. dergelijke beperkingen geen afbreuk doen aan de rechten die verleend zijn op grond van artikel 14, eerste lid, aan investeerders van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot hun investeringen;  

b. dergelijke restricties niet van invloed zijn op de lopende transacties; en  

c. de Verdragsluitende Partij er voor zorgt dat investeringen op haar grondgebied door de investeerders van alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen, wat de transfers betreft een behandeling krijgen die niet minder gunstig is dan die welke zij verleent aan investeringen van investeerders van één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen afzonderlijk of van een derde land, waarbij de meest gunstige wordt toegepast.    

2. Dit besluit is onderworpen aan een onderzoek door de Conferentie van het Handvest dat vijf jaar na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag zal plaatsvinden, doch uiterlijk op de datum als genoemd in artikel 32, derde lid.  

3. Geen Verdragsluitende Partij komt in aanmerking om dergelijke beperkingen toe te passen tenzij het om een Verdragsluitende Partij gaat die deel uitmaakte van de vroegere Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken, en deze Verdragsluitende Partij het voorlopige Secretariaat uiterlijk op 1 juli 1995 schriftelijk ervan in kennis heeft gesteld dat zij besloten heeft om in aanmerking te komen om beperkingen overeenkomstig dit besluit toe te passen.  

4. Voor alle duidelijkheid wordt bepaald dat met betrekking tot artikel 16 door niets in het besluit mag worden afgeweken van de aldaar genoemde rechten van een Verdragsluitende Partij, haar investeerders of hun investeringen, of van de verplichtingen van een Verdragsluitende Partij.  

5. In de zin van dit besluit: zijn „lopende transacties" lopende betalingen die verband houden met het verkeer van goederen, diensten of personen die verricht worden overeenkomstig de normaal geldende internationale praktijken en geen regelingen inhouden welke materieel gezien een combinatie vormen van een lopende betaling en een kapitaaltransactie, zoals uitgestelde betalingen en voorschotten, welke ten doel heeft om de respectieve wetgeving van de beperkende partij op dat gebied te ontduiken.    

4.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 14, tweede lid*  Onverminderd de eisen van artikel 14 en andere internationale verplichtingen zal Roemenië gedurende de overgang naar volledige convertibiliteit van zijn nationale munteenheid proberen de nodige stappen te ondernemen om de efficiency van de procedures voor de transfers van investeringsopbrengsten te verbeteren en zal in elk geval dergelijke transfers in een vrij inwisselbare munteenheid zonder beperking of een vertraging van meer dan zes maanden garanderen. Roemenië zal er voor zorgen dat investeringen op zijn gebied van investeerders van alle andere Verdragsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot transfers een niet minder gunstige behandeling krijgen dan die welke het toestaat aan investeringen van investeerders van een afzonderlijke Verdragsluitende Partij of van een derde land, waarbij de meest gunstige wordt toegepast.  

5.  *Ten aanzien van artikel 24, vierde lid, letter a), en artikel 25*  Een investering van een in artikel 1, zevende lid, letter a), onder ii), bedoelde investeerder, van een Verdragsluitende Partij die geen partij is bij een overeenkomst tot economische integratie, of van een lid van een vrijhandelszone of een douane-unie, komt in aanmerking voor een behandeling die wordt toegestaan uit hoofde van een dergelijke overeenkomst tot economische integratie, een vrijhandelszone of een douane-unie, op voorwaarde dat het bedrijf dat de investering doet: 

a. zijn statutaire zetel, hoofdbestuur of hoofdvestiging in het gebied van een partij bij die overeenkomst tot economische integratie, van een lid van die vrijhandelszone of van een lid van die douane-unie heeft; dan wel  

b. indien dit uitsluitend zijn statutaire zetel in dat gebied heeft, een daadwerkelijke en permanente band heeft met de economie van één van de partijen bij die overeenkomst tot economische integratie, van die vrijhandelszone of die douane-unie.
