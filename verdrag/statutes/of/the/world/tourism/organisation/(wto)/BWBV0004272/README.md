2. Het financiële jaar loopt van 1 januari tot 31 december.  

3. De begroting wordt bekostigd door middel van bijdragen van leden volgens een door de Vergadering vastgestelde verdeelsleutel, die is gebaseerd op het economische ontwikkelingspeil en op het belang van het internationale toerisme in ieder land, alsmede door middel van andere inkomsten van de Organisatie.  

4. De begroting wordt opgesteld in euro. De bijdragen van de leden worden in euro betaald of in een andere door de Vergadering vastgestelde valuta of combinatie van valuta’s. De Secretaris-Generaal kan evenwel bijdragen van leden in andere valuta’s aanvaarden tot een door de Vergadering toegestaan bedrag.  

5. Er wordt een Algemeen Fonds gevormd. Alle bijdragen van leden geleverd overeenkomstig § 3, inkomsten van diverse oorsprong en elk voorschot uit het Operationeel Fonds worden in het Algemeen Fonds gestort. Kosten verband houdend met het beheer der Organisatie, alsmede met het algemeen programma worden door het Algemeen Fonds gedragen.  

6. Er wordt een Operationeel Fonds gevormd, waarvan de omvang door de Vergadering wordt vastgesteld. De voorschotten op de bijdragen van de leden worden in dit Fonds gestort, alsmede alle andere inkomsten waaraan de Vergadering een zodanige bestemming toekent. Eventueel kunnen bedragen uit dit Fonds overgemaakt worden naar het Algemeen Fonds.  

7. Er kunnen Fondsen in beheer worden gevormd ten einde niet in de begroting van de Organisatie opgenomen werkzaamheden die van belang zijn voor bepaalde landen of groepen van landen te bekostigen; deze Fondsen worden door vrijwillige bijdragen bekostigd. De Organisatie kan een vergoeding voor het beheer van deze Fondsen vragen.  

8. De Vergadering bepaalt de bestemming van giften, legaten en andere buitengewone inkomsten die niet op de begroting van de Organisatie voorkomen.  

9. De Secretaris-Generaal legt een ontwerp-begroting voor aan de Raad ten minste drie maanden voor de datum van de desbetreffende bijeenkomst van de Raad. De Raad bestudeert dit ontwerp en legt de begroting aan de Vergadering voor ter definitieve bestudering en goedkeuring. De ontwerp-begroting van de Raad wordt de leden van de Vergadering ten minste drie maanden voor de desbetreffende bijeenkomst toegezonden.  

10. De Vergadering keurt jaarlijks de begroting voor de tweejaarlijkse financieringsperiode en de verdeelsleutel voor elk jaar goed, alsmede de jaarlijkse boekhouding die betrekking heeft op het beheer der Organisatie.

Op verzoek van de Raad kan de Vergadering niettemin dit lid toestaan deel te nemen aan de stemming en gebruik te maken van de diensten van de Organisatie, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het in gebreke blijven te betalen, te wijten is aan buiten de schuld van dat lid liggende omstandigheden.

Bij het berekenen van de verdeelsleutel dient ten aanzien van de geassocieerde en geaffilieerde leden rekening te worden gehouden met de verschillende aard van hun lidmaatschap en de beperkte rechten die zij binnen de Organisatie genieten.
