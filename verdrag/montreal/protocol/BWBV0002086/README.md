####Protocol van Montreal betreffende stoffen die de ozonlaag afbreken

De Partijen bij dit Protocol, Partij zijnde bij het Verdrag van Wenen ter bescherming van de ozonlaag, Indachtig de uit hoofde van dat Verdrag op hen rustende verplichting passende maatregelen te treffen om de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu te beschermen tegen de schadelijke gevolgen, voortvloeiend of vermoedelijk voortvloeiend uit activiteiten van de mens die veranderingen veroorzaken of vermoedelijk veroorzaken in de ozonlaag, Erkennende dat de uitworp van bepaalde stoffen over de gehele wereld de ozonlaag dusdanig kan afbreken en anderszins veranderen, dat daaruit vermoedelijk schadelijke gevolgen voor de gezondheid van de mens en het leefmilieu voortvloeien, Zich bewust van de mogelijke klimatologische gevolgen van de uitworp van deze stoffen, Beseffende dat maatregelen ter bescherming van de ozonlaag tegen afbraak gebaseerd zouden moeten zijn op ter zake dienende wetenschappelijke kennis, rekening houdend met technische en economische overwegingen, Vastbesloten de ozonlaag te beschermen door middel van voorzorgsmaatregelen die beogen de totale mondiale uitworp van stoffen die de ozonlaag afbreken op billijke wijze te beheersen, met het uiteindelijke doel deze uitworp geheel uit te bannen gebaseerd op ontwikkelingen in de wetenschappelijke kennis, rekening houdend met technische en economische overwegingen en met de bijzondere behoeften van ontwikkelingslanden, Erkennende dat er een bijzondere regeling noodzakelijk is om tegemoet te komen aan de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden, met inbegrip van het verschaffen van extra financiële middelen en het verschaffen van toegang tot de desbetreffende technologieën, indachtig het feit dat de hoeveelheid benodigde financiële middelen voorspeld kan worden, en dat die middelen een aanzienlijk verschil kunnen maken in de mate waarin de wereld in staat is het wetenschappelijk vastgestelde probleem van het afbreken van de ozonlaag en de schadelijke gevolgen daarvan op te lossen, Vaststellende dat op nationale en regionale schaal reeds voorzorgsmaatregelen zijn getroffen om de uitworp van bepaalde chloorfluorkoolwaterstoffen beheersen, Overwegende dat het van belang is internationale samenwerking te bevorderen op het gebied van onderzoek, ontwikkeling en overdracht van vervangende technologieën met betrekking tot de beheersing en vermindering van de uitworp van stoffen die de ozonlaag afbreken, met bijzondere aandacht voor de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden, Zijn als volgt overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  1  

####Begripomschrijvingen

Voor de toepassing van dit Protocol wordt verstaan onder: 

1. „Verdrag”: het Verdrag van Wenen ter bescherming van de ozonlaag van 22 maart 1985.  

2. „Partijen”: de Partijen bij dit Protocol, tenzij anders vermeld.  

3. „secretariaat”: het bij het Verdrag opgerichte secretariaat.  

4. „aan uitworpbeheersing onderworpen stof': een in Bijlage A, Bijlage B, Bijlage C of Bijlage E bij dit Protocol genoemde stof, ongeacht of deze als zodanig of in een mengsel voorkomt. Inbegrepen zijn de isomeren van die stof, behoudens bepalingen daarover in de desbetreffende Bijlage; niet inbegrepen zijn evenwel aan uitworpbeheersing onderworpen stoffen of mengsels in een ander industrieprodukt dan in een houder die wordt gebruikt voor het vervoer of de opslag van die stof.  

5. „produktie”: de hoeveelheid geproduceerde aan uitworpbeheersing onderworpen stoffen verminderd met de hoeveelheid die is vernietigd met behulp van door de Partijen goed te keuren technologieën, en verminderd met de hoeveelheid die geheel wordt gebruikt als grondstof bij de vervaardiging van andere chemicaliën. De hoeveelheid die, eventueel na bewerking, wordt hergebruikt, mag niet tot de „produktie” worden gerekend.  

6. „gebruik”: de produktie vermeerderd met de invoer verminderd met de uitvoer van aan uitworpbeheersing onderworpen stoffen.  

7. „berekende niveau” van produktie, invoer, uitvoer respectievelijk gebruik: de overeenkomstig artikel 3 vastgestelde niveaus,  

8. „industriële rationalisering”: het overdragen van de gehele of een gedeelte van het berekende niveau van produktie van de ene Partij aan een andere ter verhoging van de economische doelmatigheid of om te voorzien in verwachte tekorten in het aanbod ten gevolge van bedrijfssluitingen.    

### Artikel  2  

####Beheersingsmaatregelen

1.   Opgenomen door artikel 2A.    
2.   Vervangen door artikel 2B.    
3.  Elke Partij verzekert dat gedurende het tijdvak van 1 juli 1993 tot en met 30 juni 1994, en in elk tijdvak van twaalf maanden daarna, haar berekend gebruik van de in Groep I van Bijlage A genoemde aan uitworpbeheersing onderworpen stoffen jaarlijks niet meer zal bedragen dan tachtig procent van haar berekende consumptie over 1986. Elke Partij die één of meer van deze stoffen produceert, verzekert dat gedurende dezelfde tijdvakken haar berekende produktie van deze stoffen jaarlijks niet meer zal bedragen dan tachtig procent van haar berekende produktie over 1986.

####Financiële regelingen

1.  De Partijen stellen regelingen vast voor financiële en technische samenwerking, met inbegrip van de overdracht van technologieën, ten behoeve van de onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 van dit Protocol vallende Partijen, om hen in staat te stellen de in de artikelen 2A tot en met 2E en artikel 2I van het Protocol vervatte beheersingsmaatregelen, en in de artikelen 2F tot en met 2H vervatte beheersingsmaatregelen waartoe wordt besloten ingevolge artikel 5, lid een bis uit te voeren. Bijdragen in het kader van deze regelingen treden niet in de plaats van andere vormen van financiële steun aan de onder de werking van dat lid vallende Partijen. De regelingen dienen alle overeengekomen meerkosten te dekken die die Partijen maken ten einde hen in staat te stellen de beheersingsmaatregelen van het Protocol uit te voeren. De vergadering van de Partijen stelt een lijst van de categorieën van meerkosten samen die als richtsnoer zal dienen.   
2.  De krachtens het eerste lid vastgestelde regelingen omvatten onder andere de instelling van een Multilateraal Fonds. Zij kunnen tevens andere vormen van multilaterale, regionale en bilaterale samenwerking omvatten.   
3.  Het Multilaterale Fonds: 

a. dekt, door schenkingen of zachte leningen, naar gelang de situatie, en overeenkomstig door de Partijen vast te stellen criteria, de overeengekomen meerkosten;  

b. financiert bemiddeling tussen vraag en aanbod (clearing house activities) om: 

i. de onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 vallende Partijen, door middel van specifieke landenstudies en andere vormen van technische samenwerking, te helpen vast te stellen op welke gebieden zij behoefte hebben aan samenwerking;  

ii. technische samenwerking te vergemakkelijken om aan deze behoeften te voldoen;  

iii. overeenkomstig artikel 9 gegevens en materiaal te verspreiden, en workshops, cursussen en andere soortgelijke activiteiten te organiseren, ten behoeve van Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn; en  

iv. andere vormen van multilaterale, regionale en bilaterale samenwerking die beschikbaar zijn voor Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn, te vergemakkelijken en op die samenwerking toe te zien;    

c. financiert de secretariële diensten van het Multilaterale Fonds en de kosten van daarmee verband houdende ondersteunende activiteiten.     
4.  Het Multilaterale Fonds valt onder het gezag van de Partijen, die ter zake het algehele beleid bepalen.   
5.  De Partijen stellen een Uitvoerend Comité in voor het ontwikkelen en het toezien op de uitvoering van specifieke beleidsplannen, richtlijnen en bestuurlijke regelingen, met inbegrip van de besteding van middelen, ten einde de doeleinden van het Multilaterale Fonds te verwezenlijken. Het Uitvoerend Comité zal zich van zijn taken en verantwoordelijkheden, zoals vervat in zijn door de Partijen overeengekomen mandaat, kwijten met medewerking en ondersteuning van de Internationale Bank voor Herstel en Ontwikkeling (Wereldbank), het Milieuprogramma van de Verenigde Naties, het Ontwikkelingsprogramma van de Verenigde Naties of andere organisaties, afhankelijk van de terreinen waarop zij deskundig zijn. De leden van het Uitvoerend Comité, dat dient te zijn samengesteld op basis van een evenwichtige vertegenwoordiging van de onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 vallende Partijen enerzijds en de Partijen die daar niet onder vallen anderzijds, dienen door de Partijen te worden benoemd.   
6.  Het Multilaterale Fonds wordt gefinancierd door bijdragen van niet onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 vallende Partijen in inwisselbare valuta, of onder bepaalde omstandigheden, in natura en/of in hun nationale valuta, op basis van de contributieschaal van de Verenigde Naties. Andere Partijen worden aangemoedigd bijdragen te leveren. Bilaterale en, in bepaalde gevallen overeengekomen in een beslissing van de Partijen, regionale samenwerking kunnen, tot een bepaald percentage van de Partijen vast te stellen criteria, worden beschouwd als een bijdrage aan het Multilaterale Fonds, op voorwaarde dat die samenwerking ten minste: 

a. strikt verband houdt met naleving van de bepalingen van het Protocol;  

b. voorziet in extra middelen;  

c. overeengekomen meerkosten dekt.     
7.  De Partijen beslissen over het programmabudget van het Multilaterale Fonds voor ieder belastingtijdvak en over het percentage van bijdragen van iedere Partij aan dat budget.   
8.  Besteding van middelen die ter beschikking staan van het Multilaterale Fonds, behoeft de instemming van de begunstigde Partij.   
9.  Beslissingen van de Partijen krachtens dit artikel worden, wanneer mogelijk, met consensus genomen. Indien alle pogingen om consensus te bereiken vruchteloos zijn gebleken en er geen overeenstemming is bereikt, worden beslissingen genomen met een meerderheid van tweederde van de stemmen van de Partijen die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen, die een meerderheid vertegenwoordigen van de onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 vallende Partijen die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen en van de niet daaronder vallende Partijen die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen.   
10.  De in dit artikel bedoelde financiële regelingen laten regelingen die in de toekomst ten aanzien van andere milieuvraagstukken worden ontwikkeld, onverlet.   

### Artikel  10A  

####Overdracht van technologie

Elke Partij neemt alle mogelijke stappen, in overeenstemming met de krachtens de financiële regelingen gesteunde programma's, om te verzekeren: 

a. dat de best beschikbare, en voor het milieu veilige vervangende stoffen die voorhanden zijn en de daarmee verband houdende technologieën met spoed worden overgedragen aan de onder de werking van het eerste lid van artikel 5 vallende Partijen; en
