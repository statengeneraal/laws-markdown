##Protocol bij het Verdrag van 1979 betreffende grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging over lange afstand, inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen

####Protocol to the 1979 Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution on persistent organic pollutants

The Parties, Determined to implement the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, Recognizing that emissions of many persistent organic pollutants are transported across international boundaries and are deposited in Europe, North America and the Arctic, far from their site of origin, and that the atmosphere is the dominant medium of transport, Aware that persistent organic pollutants resist degradation under natural conditions and have been associated with adverse effects on human health and the environment, Concerned that persistent organic pollutants can biomagnify in upper trophic levels to concentrations which might affect the health of exposed wildlife and humans, Acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and especially its indigenous people, who subsist on Arctic fish and mammals, are particularly at risk because of the biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants, Mindful that measures to control emissions of persistent organic pollutants would also contribute to the protection of the environment and human health in areas outside the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's region, including the Arctic and international waters, Resolved to take measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize emissions of persistent organic pollutants, taking into account the application of the precautionary approach, as set forth in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, Noting the need for global action on persistent organic pollutants and recalling the role envisaged in chapter 9 of Agenda 21 for regional agreements to reduce global transboundary air pollution and, in particular, for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to share its regional experience with other regions of the world, Recognizing that there are subregional, regional and global regimes in place, including international instruments governing the management of hazardous wastes, their transboundary movement and disposal, in particular the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, Considering that the predominant sources of air pollution contributing to the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants are the use of certain pesticides, the manufacture and use of certain chemicals, and the unintentional formation of certain substances in waste incineration, combustion, metal production and mobile sources, Aware that techniques and management practices are available to reduce emissions of persistent organic pollutants into the air, Conscious of the need for a cost-effective regional approach to combating air pollution, Noting the important contribution of the private and non-governmental sectors to knowledge of the effects associated with persistent organic pollutants, available alternatives and abatement techniques, and their role in assisting in the reduction of emissions of persistent organic pollutants, Bearing in mind that measures taken to reduce persistent organic pollutant emissions should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international competition and trade, Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on emissions, atmospheric processes and effects on human health and the environment of persistent organic pollutants, as well as on abatement costs, and acknowledging the need to continue scientific and technical cooperation to further the understanding of these issues, Recognizing the measures on persistent organic pollutants already taken by some of the Parties on a national level and/or under other international conventions, Have agreed as follows:

### Annex  IV  

####Limit values for PCDD/F from major stationary sources

### I  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

A definition of dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) is provided in annex III to the present Protocol.  

### 2  

Limit values are expressed as ng/m³ or mg/m³ under standard conditions (273.15 K, 101.3 kPa, and dry gas).  

### 3  

Limit values relate to the normal operating situation, including start-up and shutdown procedures, unless specific limit values have been defined for those situations.  

### 4  

Sampling and analysis of all pollutants shall be carried out according to the standards laid down by the Comité européen de normalisation (CEN), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or the corresponding United States or Canadian reference methods. While awaiting the development of CEN or ISO standards, national standards shall apply.  

### 5  

For verification purposes, the interpretation of measurement results in relation to the limit value must also take into account the inaccuracy of the measurement method. A limit value is considered to be met if the result of the measurement, from which the inaccuracy of the measurement method is subtracted, does not exceed it.  

### 6  

Emissions of different congeners of PCDD/F are given in toxicity equivalents (TE) in comparison to 2,3,7,8-TCDD using the system proposed by the NATO Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society (NATO-CCMS) in 1988.  

### II  

####LIMIT VALUES FOR MAJOR STATIONARY SOURCES

### 7  

The following limit values, which refer to 11% O <sub>2</sub> concentration in flue gas, apply to the following incinerator types: 

Municipal solid waste (burning more than 3 tonnes per hour) 0.1 ng TE/m³  

Medical solid waste (burning more than 1 tonne per hour) 0.5 ng TE/m³  

Hazardous waste (burning more than 1 tonne per hour) 0.2 ng TE/m³    

### Annex  V  

####Best available techniques to control emissions of persistent organic pollutants from major stationary sources

### I  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

The purpose of this annex is to provide the Parties to the Convention with guidance in identifying best available techniques to allow them to meet the obligations in article 3, paragraph 5, of the Protocol. Further description of, and guidance regarding, such best available techniques is provided in a guidance document adopted by the Parties at a session of the Executive Body and may be updated as necessary by a consensus of the Parties meeting within the Executive Body.  

### 2  

“Best available techniques" (BAT) means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing in principle the basis for emission limit values designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and their impact on the environment as a whole: 

– “Techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;  

– “Available" techniques means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the territory of the Party in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;  

– “Best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.   In determining the best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the factors below, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and the principles of precaution and prevention: 

– The use of low-waste technology;  

– The use of less hazardous substances;  

– The furthering of recovery and recycling of substances generated and used in the process and of waste;  

– Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;  

– Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;  

– The nature, effects and volume of the emissions concerned;  

– The commissioning dates for new or existing installations;  

– The time needed to introduce the best available technique;  

– The consumption and nature of raw materials (including water) used in the process and its energy efficiency;  

– The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the emissions on the environment and the risks to it;  

– The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment.   The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.  

### 3  

Information regarding the effectiveness and costs of control measures is based on documents received and reviewed by the Task Force and the Preparatory Working Group on POPs. Unless otherwise indicated, the techniques listed are considered to be well established on the basis of operational experience.  

### 4  

Experience with new plants incorporating low-emission techniques, as well as with retrofitting of existing plants, is continuously growing. The regular elaboration and amendment of the guidance document referred to in paragraph 1 above will therefore be necessary. Best available techniques (BAT) identified for new plants can usually be applied to existing plants provided there is an adequate transition period and they are adapted.  

### 5  

The guidance document referred to in paragraph 1 above lists a number of control measures which span a range of costs and efficiencies. The choice of measures for any particular case will depend on a number of factors, including economic circumstances, technological infrastructure and capacity, and any existing air pollution control measures.  

### 6  

The most important POPs emitted from stationary sources are: 

a) Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/F);  

b) Hexachlorobenzene (HCB);  

c) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).   Relevant definitions are provided in annex III to the present Protocol.  

### II  

####MAJOR STATIONARY SOURCES OF POP EMISSIONS

### 7  

PCDD/F are emitted from thermal processes involving organic matter and chlorine as a result of incomplete combustion or chemical reactions. Major stationary sources of PCDD/F may be as follows: 

a) Waste incineration, including co-incineration;  

b) Thermal metallurgical processes, e.g. production of aluminium and other non-ferrous metals, iron and steel;  

c) Combustion plants providing energy;  

d) Residential combustion; and  

e) Specific chemical production processes releasing intermediates and by-products.    

### 8  

Major stationary sources of PAH emissions may be as follows: 

a) Domestic wood and coal heating;  

b) Open fires such as refuse burning, forest fires and after-crop burning;  

c) Coke and anode production;  

d) Aluminium production (via Soederberg process); and  

e) Wood preservation installations, except for a Party for which this category does not make a significant contribution to its total emissions of PAH (as defined in annex III).    

### 9  

Emissions of HCB result from the same type of thermal and chemical processes as those emitting PCDD/F, and HCB is formed by a similar mechanism. Major sources of HCB emissions may be as follows: 

a) Waste incineration plants, including co-incineration;  

b) Thermal sources of metallurgical industries; and  

c) Use of chlorinated fuels in furnace installations.

####Protocol bij het Verdrag van 1979 betreffende grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging over lange afstand, inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen

De Partijen, Vastbesloten het Verdrag betreffende grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging over lange afstand uit te voeren, Erkennend dat emissies van veel persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen over internationale grenzen heen worden meegevoerd en in Europa, Noord-Amerika en het noordpoolgebied, ver van hun plaats van oorsprong, worden gedeponeerd en dat de atmosfeer het belangrijkste transportmedium vormt, Zich ervan bewust dat persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen onder natuurlijke omstandigheden zeer slecht ontleden en in verband zijn gebracht met schadelijke gevolgen voor de volksgezondheid en het milieu, Bezorgd over het feit dat persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen door biomagnificatie op hogere trofische niveaus concentraties kunnen bereiken die de gezondheid van daaraan blootgestelde dieren en mensen kunnen aantasten, Erkennend dat de arctische ecosystemen en vooral de inheemse bevolking, die van arctische vissoorten en zoogdieren leeft, ten gevolge van de biomagnificatie van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, bijzonder bedreigd zijn, Indachtig het feit dat maatregelen ter beheersing van emissies van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen tevens zouden bijdragen tot de bescherming van het milieu en de volksgezondheid in gebieden buiten de regio van de Economische Commissie voor Europa van de Verenigde Naties, met inbegrip van de arctische en internationale wateren, Met het vaste voornemen voorzorgsmaatregelen te treffen teneinde emissies van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen voor te zijn, deze te vermijden of tot een minimum terug te brengen, rekening houdend met de toepassing van de aanpak volgens het voorzorgsbeginsel, zoals bedoeld in beginsel 15 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake milieu en ontwikkeling, Nogmaals bevestigend dat de Staten, overeenkomstig het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en de beginselen van internationaal recht, het soevereine recht hebben hun eigen hulpbronnen te exploiteren volgens hun eigen milieu- en ontwikkelingsbeleid alsmede ervoor verantwoordelijk zijn dat activiteiten die onder hun rechtsmacht of toezicht worden verricht, geen schade veroorzaken aan het milieu van andere Staten of van gebieden die buiten de grenzen van de nationale rechtsmacht vallen, Wijzend op de noodzaak van een mondiaal optreden met betrekking tot persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen en herinnerend aan de rol die regionale overeenkomsten volgens hoofdstuk 9 van Agenda 21 moeten vervullen bij het terugdringen in de gehele wereld van grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging en met name de rol van de Economische Commissie voor Europa van de Verenigde Naties die haar regionale ervaring met andere regio's van de wereld moet delen, Erkennend dat er subregionale, regionale en mondiale regelingen bestaan, waaronder internationale overeenkomsten betreffende het beheer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen, het grensoverschrijdende verkeer en de verwijdering daarvan, met name het Verdrag van Bazel inzake de beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en de verwijdering ervan, Overwegende dat het gebruik van bepaalde bestrijdingsmiddelen, de vervaardiging en het gebruik van bepaalde chemische stoffen en de onopzettelijke vorming van bepaalde stoffen bij afvalverbranding, verbranding, metaalproductie en mobiele bronnen, de belangrijkste oorzaken van luchtverontreiniging vormen die tot de accumulatie van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen bijdragen, Zich ervan bewust dat technieken en beheerspraktijken beschikbaar zijn om emissies van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen in de lucht terug te dringen, Zich bewust van de noodzaak van een kosteneffectieve regionale aanpak voor de bestrijding van luchtverontreiniging, Wijzend op de belangrijke bijdrage van de particuliere en de niet-gouvernementele sector aan de kennis van de effecten van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, beschikbare alternatieven en bestrijdingstechnieken alsook op de rol die zij mede spelen bij de terugdringing van emissies van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, In aanmerking nemend dat maatregelen ter vermindering van emissies van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen niet als middel tot willekeurige of ongerechtvaardigde discriminatie of als verkapte beperking van de internationale concurrentie of handel mogen dienen, In overweging nemend de bestaande wetenschappelijke en technische gegevens inzake emissies, atmosferische processen en effecten van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen op de volksgezondheid en het milieu alsook inzake de bestrijdingskosten en erkennend dat het noodzakelijk is de wetenschappelijke en technische samenwerking voort te zetten teneinde nog meer inzicht in deze problemen te verwerven, Erkennend de maatregelen inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen die reeds door bepaalde Partijen op nationaal niveau en/of in het kader van andere internationale verdragen zijn genomen, Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:

### Bijlage  IV  

####Grenswaarden voor PCDD/F uit belangrijke stationaire bronnen

### I  

####INLEIDING

### 1  

Bijlage III van dit Protocol bevat een definitie van dioxinen en furanen (PCDD/F).  

### 2  

De grenswaarden worden uitgedrukt in ng/m³ of mg/m³ onder standaardomstandigheden (273,15 K, 101,3 kPa, droog gas).  

### 3  

De grenswaarden gelden voor de normale bedrijfsomstandigheden, met inbegrip van de procedures voor opstarten en stilleggen, tenzij voor deze situaties specifieke grenswaarden zijn vastgesteld.  

### 4  

Bemonstering en analyse van alle verontreinigende stoffen gebeurt volgens de normen die zijn vastgesteld door de Europese Commissie voor Normalisatie (CEN), de Internationale Organisatie voor Normalisatie (ISO) of de dienovereenkomstige referentiemethoden van de Verenigde Staten of Canada. In afwachting van de ontwikkeling van CEN- of ISO-normen worden nationale normen gebruikt.  

### 5  

Voor controledoeleinden moet bij de interpretatie van de meetresultaten in vergelijking met de grenswaarden ook rekening worden gehouden met de onnauwkeurigheid van de meetmethode. Als het resultaat van de meting, verminderd met de onnauwkeurigheid van de meetmethode, niet hoger ligt dan de grenswaarde, wordt geacht aan de grenswaarde te zijn voldaan.  

### 6  

De emissie van de verschillende congeneren van PCDD/F wordt vermeld in toxiciteitequivalenten (TE), in vergelijking met 2,3,7,8-TCDD, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van het systeem dat in 1988 is voorgesteld door het Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society van de NAVO (NATO-CCMS).

### Bijlage  V  

####Beste beschikbare technieken voor de beperking van de emissie van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen door belangrijke stationaire bronnen

### I  

####INLEIDING

### 1  

Deze bijlage is bedoeld om de Partijen bij het verdrag richtsnoeren te geven bij de bepaling van de beste beschikbare technieken zodat ze kunnen voldoen aan de verplichtingen in artikel 3, lid 5, van het Protocol.  

### 2  

Onder „beste beschikbare technieken" (BBT) wordt verstaan: het meest doeltreffende en geavanceerde ontwikkelingsstadium van de activiteiten en exploitatiemethoden, waarbij de praktische bruikbaarheid van speciale technieken om in beginsel het uitgangspunt voor de emissiegrenswaarden te vormen is aangetoond, met het doel emissies en effecten op het milieu in zijn geheel te voorkomen, of wanneer dat niet mogelijk blijkt algemeen te beperken: 

– Onder „technieken" wordt verstaan: zowel de toegepaste technieken als de wijze waarop de installatie wordt ontworpen, gebouwd, onderhouden, geëxploiteerd en ontmanteld;  

– Onder „beschikbare" technieken wordt verstaan: op zodanige schaal ontwikkeld dat de betrokken technieken, kosten en baten in aanmerking genomen, economisch en technisch haalbaar in de betrokken industriële context kunnen worden toegepast, onafhankelijk van de vraag of die technieken al dan niet op het grondgebied van de betrokken Lid-Staat worden toegepast of geproduceerd, mits zij voor de exploitant op redelijke voorwaarden toegankelijk zijn;  

– Onder „beste" wordt verstaan: het meest doeltreffend voor het bereiken van een hoog algemeen niveau van bescherming van het milieu in zijn geheel.   Bij de bepaling van de beste beschikbare technieken moet in het algemeen of in specifieke gevallen bijzondere aandacht worden besteed aan onderstaande factoren, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met de te verwachten kosten en baten van een maatregel en het voorzorg- en het preventiebeginsel: 

– Het gebruik van technologie die weinig afval oplevert;  

– Het gebruik van minder gevaarlijke stoffen;  

– De bevordering van terugwinning en hergebruik van stoffen die tijdens het proces ontstaan en worden gebruikt en van afvalstoffen;  

– Vergelijkbare processen, installaties of exploitatiemethoden die met succes op industriële schaal zijn beproefd;  

– De vooruitgang van de techniek en de ontwikkeling van de wetenschappelijke kennis; de aard, de effecten en de omvang van de emissie;  

– De data van ingebruikneming van de nieuwe of bestaande installaties;  

– De tijd die nodig is voor het omschakelen op een betere beschikbare techniek;  

– Het verbruik en de aard van de grondstoffen (met inbegrip van water) die bij het proces worden gebruikt en de energie-efficiëntie daarvan;  

– De noodzaak om de algehele milieueffecten en milieurisico's van de emissie te voorkomen of tot een minimum te beperken;  

– De noodzaak om ongevallen te voorkomen en de gevolgen daarvan voor het milieu tot een minimum te beperken.   Het is niet de bedoeling om aan de hand van het begrip beste beschikbare technieken bepaalde technieken of technologie voor te schrijven, maar om rekening te houden met de technische karakteristieken van de desbetreffende installatie, de geografische locatie en de plaatselijke milieusituatie.  

### 3  

De informatie over de effectiviteit en de kosten van beperkende maatregelen is gebaseerd op documenten die door de Task force en de Voorbereidende werkgroep voor POP's zijn ontvangen en geëvalueerd. Tenzij anders wordt aangegeven, worden de vermelde technieken op basis van de ervaring in de praktijk als ingeburgerd beschouwd.  

### 4  

Er wordt voortdurend nieuwe ervaring opgedaan met nieuwe installaties waar technieken met een geringe emissie worden gebruikt en de aanpassing van bestaande installaties. De bijlage zal dan ook periodiek moeten worden geëvalueerd en aangepast. De beste beschikbare technieken voor nieuwe installaties kunnen meestal ook voor bestaande installaties worden gebruikt, mits er een adequate overgangsperiode is en de technieken worden aangepast.  

### 5  

In de bijlage is een aantal beperkende maatregelen met uiteenlopende kosten en efficiëntie opgenomen. Bij de keuze van maatregelen voor een specifiek geval zal rekening worden gehouden met een aantal factoren, zoals de economische situatie, de technologische infrastructuur en capaciteit, en eventuele reeds genomen maatregelen om de luchtverontreiniging te beperken.  

### 6  

De belangrijkste POP's die door stationaire bronnen worden uitgestoten zijn: 

a. polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen/furanen (PCDD/F);  

b. hexachloorbenzeen (HCB);  

c. polycyclische aromatische koolwaterstoffen (PAK's).   Definities van deze stoffen zijn opgenomen in bijlage III van dit Protocol.  

### II  

####BELANGRIJKE STATIONAIRE BRONNEN VAN POP-UITSTOOT

### 7  

PCDD/F worden uitgestoten door onvolledige verbranding of chemische reacties bij thermische processen waarbij organisch materiaal en chloor aanwezig zijn. Belangrijke stationaire bronnen van PCDD/F zijn: 

a. Afvalverbranding met inbegrip van bijstoken;  

b. Thermische metallurgische processen zoals de vervaardiging van aluminium en andere non-ferrometalen, ijzer en staal;  

c. Verbrandingsinstallaties die energie leveren;  

d. Huisverwarmingsinstallaties;  

e. Specifieke chemische productieprocessen waarbij tussen- en nevenproducten vrijkomen.    

### 8  

Belangrijke stationaire bronnen van PAK-uitstoot zijn: 

a. Woningverwarming met hout en kolen;  

b. Open vuur, bijvoorbeeld bij vuilverbranding, bosbranden en afbranden na de oogst;  

c. Kooks- en anodeproductie;  

d. Aluminiumproductie (via het Soederberg-procédé);  

e. Installaties voor houtverduurzaming, behalve voor een Partij waarvoor deze categorie geen significante bijdrage tot haar totale uitstoot van PAK's (zoals gedefinieerd in bijlage III) levert.    

### 9  

De emissie van HCB vindt plaats bij hetzelfde soort thermische en chemische processen als waarbij PCDD/F wordt uitgestoten en HCB ontstaat ook via een vergelijkbaar mechanisme. Belangrijke bronnen van HCB-emissie zijn: 

a. Installaties voor afvalverbranding met inbegrip van bijstoken;  

b. Thermische bronnen in de metallurgische industrie;  

c. Gebruik van gechloreerde brandstof in oveninstallaties.    

### III  

####ALGEMENE AANPAK BIJ DE BEPERKING OF PREVENTIE VAN DE EMISSIE VAN POP'S

### 10  

Er zijn verschillende manieren waarop de beperking of preventie van de emissie van POP's door stationaire bronnen kan worden aangepakt. Voorbeelden zijn de vervanging van de gebruikte materialen, wijzigingen in het procédé (waaronder onderhoud en bedrijfsvoering) en aanpassing van bestaande installaties. In de volgende lijst wordt een algemene indicatie gegeven van de beschikbare maatregelen, die afzonderlijk of gecombineerd kunnen worden toegepast: 

a. Vervanging van de gebruikte materialen wanneer dit POP's zijn of wanneer er een direct verband is tussen de materialen en de uitstoot van POP's door de bron;  

b. Een optimale milieuzorg zoals een goed beheer, preventieve onderhoudsprogramma's of wijzigingen in het procédé zoals gesloten systemen (b.v. in kooksfabrieken) of het gebruik van inerte elektrodes voor elektrolyse;  

c. Wijziging van het procédé om voor volledige verbranding te zorgen, zodat de vorming van POP's wordt voorkomen, via de aanpassing van parameters als de verbrandingstemperatuur of de verblijftijd;  

d. Methoden voor de reiniging van rookgassen zoals thermische of katalytische verbranding of oxidatie, stofvangers of adsorptie;  

e. Behandeling van restmaterialen, afval en zuiveringsslib, bijvoorbeeld door verhitting of door ze inert te maken.    

### 11  

De voor de verschillende maatregelen in de tabellen 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 en 9 vermelde emissieniveaus zijn meestal specifiek voor het desbetreffende geval. De emissieniveaus worden vermeld als percentage van de emissiegrenswaarden met conventionele technieken.  

### 12  

Kosten-batenoverwegingen kunnen worden gebaseerd op de totale kosten per jaar per eenheid emissiebeperking (inclusief investeringen en bedrijfskosten). De kosten van de beperking van de POP-emissie moeten ook worden bezien binnen het kader van de algehele economische aspecten van het proces, zoals de effecten van de beperkende maatregelen en de productiekosten. Gezien de vele factoren die een rol spelen, zijn de cijfers voor de investeringen en de bedrijfskosten voor elk geval zeer specifiek.  

### IV  

####TECHNIEKEN VOOR DE BEPERKING VAN DE PCDD/F-EMISSIE

### A  

####Afvalverbranding

### 13  

Afvalverbranding omvat de verbranding van stedelijk afval, gevaarlijk afval, medisch afval en zuiveringsslib.  

### 14  

De belangrijkste maatregelen om de emissie van PCDD/F door afvalverbrandingsinstallaties te beperken zijn: 

a. Primaire maatregelen ten aanzien van het verbrande afval;  

b. Primaire maatregelen ten aanzien van de procestechnieken;  

c. Maatregelen voor de regulering van fysische parameters van het verbrandingsproces en de rookgassen (temperatuur, koelsnelheid, zuurstofgehalte enz.);  

d. Rookgasreiniging;  

e. Behandeling van de restproducten van het reinigingsproces.    

### 15  

De *primaire maatregelen ten aanzien van het verbrande afval*, waarbij de materiaaltoevoer wordt aangepast door gehalogeneerde stoffen te vervangen door niet-gehalogeneerde stoffen, zijn niet geschikt voor de verbranding van stedelijk of gevaarlijk afval. In dat geval is het effectiever het verbrandingsproces aan te passen en secundaire maatregelen voor rookgasreiniging te nemen. De aanpassing van de materiaaltoevoer is een nuttige primaire maatregel om de hoeveelheid afval te beperken en heeft daarnaast als voordeel dat recycling mogelijk is. Dit kan leiden tot een indirecte beperking van de PCDD/F-uitstoot doordat er minder afval wordt verbrand.  

### 16  

De *wijziging van procestechnieken* om de verbrandingsomstandigheden te optimaliseren is een belangrijke en effectieve maatregel om de PCDD/F-uitstoot te beperken (meestal 850°C of hoger, regulering van de zuurstoftoevoer afhankelijk van de verbrandingswaarde en de consistentie van het afval, een voldoende verblijftijd – 850°C gedurende ongeveer 2 seconden – en turbulentie van het gas, voorkomen van gedeelten met koud gas in de verbrandingsoven enz.). Wervelbedverbranders leveren bij een lagere temperatuur dan 850°C afdoende emissieresultaten op. Voor bestaande verbrandingsinstallaties houdt dit meestal in dat de installatie een nieuw ontwerp moet krijgen en/of moet worden vervangen, hetgeen niet in alle landen economisch verantwoord zal zijn. Het koolstofgehalte van de as moet tot een minimum worden beperkt.  

### 17  

*Rookgasmaatregelen*. De volgende maatregelen kunnen worden genomen om tot een redelijk effectieve daling van het PCDD/F-gehalte in de rookgassen te komen. De *de novo* -synthese gebeurt bij ongeveer 250 tot 450°C. Deze maatregelen moeten eerst worden genomen voordat verder beperkingen mogelijk zijn om aan het eind van de schoorsteen tot de gewenste niveaus te komen: 

a. Snelle afkoeling van de rookgassen (zeer effectief en betrekkelijk goedkoop);  

b. Toevoeging van remmers als triethanolamine of triethylamine (kan ook zorgen voor reductie van stikstofoxiden), waarbij echter om veiligheidsredenen rekening moet worden gehouden met nevenreacties;  

c. Gebruik van systemen om stof op te vangen voor temperaturen tussen 800 en 1000°C, bijvoorbeeld keramische filters en cyclonen;  

d. Gebruik van elektrische ontladingssystemen bij lage temperatuur;  

e. Preventie van de afzetting van vliegas in het afvoersysteem voor de rookgassen.    

### 18  

Methoden voor *reiniging van de rookgassen* zijn: 

a. Klassieke stofvangers om de hoeveelheid aan deeltjes gebonden PCDD/F te beperken;  

b. Selectieve katalytische reductie of selectieve niet-katalytische reductie;  

c. Adsorptie met actieve kool of kooks in vaste of wervelbedsystemen;  

d. Verschillende soorten adsorptiemethoden en geoptimaliseerde gaswassystemen met mengsels van actieve kool, martinovenkool, kalk en kalksteenoplossingen in reactoren met een vast bed, een bewegend bed en een wervelbed. De opvangefficiëntie voor gasvormig PCDD/F kan worden verbeterd door op het oppervlak van een doekfilter een afdoende laag actieve kool aan te brengen.  

e. Oxidatie met H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub>;  

f. Katalytische verbrandingsmethoden met verschillende soorten katalysatoren (Pt/Al <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub> of koper-chromietkatalysatoren met verschillende promotors om het oppervlak te stabiliseren en veroudering van de katalysator tegen te gaan).    

### 19  

Met bovengenoemde methoden kan een PCDD/F-emissieniveau van 0,1 ng TE/m³ rookgas worden gehaald. Wanneer echter gebruik wordt gemaakt van adsorbers/filters met actieve kool of kooks moet ervoor worden gezorgd dat vrijkomende koolstofdeeltjes niet zorgen voor een stijging van de PCDD/F-uitstoot in een later stadium. Tevens moet worden opgemerkt dat adsorbers en stofvangers vóór katalysatoren (SCR-techniek) residuen met PCDD/F opleveren, die moeten worden opgewerkt of op correcte wijze moeten worden verwijderd.  

### 20  

Een vergelijking tussen de verschillende maatregelen om PCDD/F in rookgassen terug te dringen is een zeer gecompliceerde zaak die leidt tot een matrix met een breed scala van industriële installaties met uiteenlopende capaciteit en configuratie. Bij een vergelijking van de kosten moet ook rekening worden gehouden met de maatregelen om de uitstoot van andere verontreinigingen, zoals zware metalen (al dan niet aan deeltjes gebonden), tot een minimum te beperken. In de meeste gevallen is het dan ook niet mogelijk een direct verband te leggen met alleen de beperking van de PCDD/F-uitstoot. Tabel 1 bevat een overzicht met de beschikbare gegevens voor de verschillende maatregelen.  

### 21  

Verbrandingsinstallaties van medisch afval kunnen in veel landen een belangrijke bron van PCDD/F vormen. Bepaalde soorten medisch afval zoals delen van het menselijk lichaam, besmet afval, naalden, bloed, plasma en cytostatica worden als een speciaal soort gevaarlijk afval behandeld, terwijl ander medisch afval vaak ladingsgewijs ter plaatse wordt verbrand. Verbrandingsinstallaties die ladingsgewijs werken kunnen aan dezelfde eisen inzake de beperking van PCDD/F voldoen als andere afvalverbranders.  

### 22  

De Partijen zullen wellicht willen overwegen of een beleid ter stimulering van de verbranding van stedelijk en medisch afval in grote regionale installaties in plaats van kleinere installaties wenselijk is. Deze aanpak kan het gebruik van BBT rendabeler maken.  

### 23  

*De behandeling van residuen van het rookgasreinigingsproces*. In tegenstelling tot as van verbrandingsinstallaties bevatten deze residuen relatief hoge concentraties zware metalen, organische verontreinigingen (met inbegrip van PCDD/F), chloriden en sulfiden. De verwijdering daarvan moet dan ook op een gecontroleerde manier gebeuren. Met name bij natte gaswassers ontstaan grote hoeveelheden zuur verontreinigd vloeibaar afval. Er bestaan enkele speciale behandelingsmethoden zoals: 

a. De katalytische behandeling van doekfilterstof bij lage temperatuur en in zuurstofarm milieu;  

b. Reiniging van doekfilterstof met het 3-R-procédé (extractie van zware metalen met zuur en verbranding om organisch materiaal te vernietigen);  

c. Verglazing van doekfilterstof;  

d. Andere immobilisatiemethoden; en  

e. Het gebruik van plasmatechnologie.    

### B  

####Thermische processen in de metallurgische industrie

### 24  

Specifieke processen in de metallurgische industrie kunnen belangrijke resterende bronnen van PCDD/F-uitstoot zijn, zoals: 

a. De primaire ijzer- en staalindustrie (b.v. hoogovens, sinterfabrieken en ijzerertspelletisering);  

b. De secundaire ijzer- en staalindustrie; en  

c. De primaire en secundaire non-ferrometaalindustrie (koperproductie).   Tabel 2 bevat een overzicht van de maatregelen ter beperking van de PCDD/F-uitstoot voor de metallurgische industrie.  

### 25  

Installaties voor metaalproductie en -bewerking met PCDD/F-emissie kunnen voldoen aan een maximale emissieconcentratie van 0,1 ng TE/m³ (bij een rookgasdebiet van meer dan 5.000 m³ /uur) indien zij beperkende maatregelen gebruiken.  

#### *Sinterfabrieken* 

### 26  

Uit metingen bij sinterfabrieken in de ijzer- en staalindustrie is gebleken dat de PCDD/F-emissie meestal tussen 0,4 en 4 ng TE/m³ ligt. Eén meting bij één installatie zonder beperkende maatregelen leverde een concentratie van 43 ng TE/m³ op.  

### 27  

Gehalogeneerde verbindingen kunnen leiden tot de vorming van PCDD/F als zij in sinterfabrieken terechtkomen via de materiaaltoevoer (kooksbries, zoutgehalte in erts) of toegevoegd gerecycleerd materiaal (zoals walshuid, stof uit hoogovengas, stof uit filters of zuiveringsslib). Net als bij de verbranding van afval is er echter geen duidelijk verband tussen het chloorgehalte van de materiaaltoevoer en de emissie van PCDD/F. Het zal wellicht afdoende zijn het gebruik van verontreinigd restmateriaal te vermijden en de walshuid te ontoliën of te ontvetten voordat deze in de sinterfabriek wordt gebracht.  

### 28  

De meest effectieve manier om de emissie van PCDD/F te beperken is door de toepassing van een combinatie van de volgende secundaire maatregelen: 

a. Recirculatie van de rookgassen zorgt voor een significante beperking van de PCDD/F-emissie. Dit zorgt bovendien voor een significante daling van het rookgasdebiet, zodat ook de installatie van eventuele extra emissiebeperkende maatregelen goedkoper wordt;  

b. Installatie van doekfilters (in sommige gevallen gecombineerd met elektrostatische stofvangers) of elektrostatische stofvangers met injectie van actieve kool/martinovenkool/kalksteenmengsels in de rookgassen;  

c. Er zijn gasreinigingsmethoden ontwikkeld waarbij de rookgassen eerst worden gekoeld en vervolgens uitgeloogd met hogedruk gaswassers met scheiding door druppeldepositie. Een emissie van 0,2 tot 0,4 ng TE/m³ is haalbaar. Door toevoeging van een geschikt adsorbeermiddel zoals bruinkoolkooks/steenkoolgruis kan een concentratie van 0,1 ng TE/m³ worden gehaald.   
###*Tabel 1:* Vergelijking van de verschillende methoden voor rookgasreiniging en proceswijzigingen in afvalverbrandingsinstallaties om de PCDD/F-uitstoot te beperken

#### *Primaire en secundaire productie van koper* 

### 29  

In bestaande installaties voor de primaire en secundaire koperproductie is na rookgasreiniging een PCDD/F-emissieconcentratie van enkele picogrammen tot 2 ng TE/m³ haalbaar. Bij één koperschachtoven is vóór optimalisering van de aggregaten een PCDD/F-emissie tot 29 ng TE/m³ gemeten. In het algemeen is er een grote variatie in de PCDD/F-emissiewaarden van deze installaties vanwege de grote verschillen in de grondstoffen die in verschillende aggregaten en processen worden gebruikt.

In het algemeen zijn de volgende maatregelen geschikt om de PCDD/F-emissie te beperken: 

a. Voorsorteren van schroot;  

b. Voorbehandeling van schroot, bijvoorbeeld door verwijdering van kunststof of PVC-coatings, voorbehandeling van kabelschroot met uitsluitend koude/mechanische methoden;  

c. Koeling van de hete rookgassen (met hergebruik van warmte) om de verblijfstijd in het kritische temperatuurgebied in het rookgassysteem te beperken;  

d. Gebruik van zuurstof of met zuurstof verrijkte lucht in ovens of zuurstofinjectie in ventilatieovens (zorgt voor volledige verbranding en een minimaal rookgasvolume);  

e. Adsorptie in een reactor met vast bed of straalstroomwervelbed met actieve kool of kolenstof uit martinoven; en  

f. Katalytische oxidatie.    

#### *Staalproductie* 

### 31  

De PCDD/F-emissie bij oxystaalfabrieken voor de prìoductie van staal en bij hoogovens met een koepeloven, elektro-oven of vlamboogoven voor het smelten van gietijzer liggen significant onder 0,1 ng TE/m³. Bij een koudeluchtoven en een draaitrommeloven (smelten van gietijzer) ligt de PCDD/F-emissie hoger.  

### 32  

Vlamboogovens die bij de secundaire staalproductie worden gebruikt, kunnen een emissieconcentratie van 0,1 ng TE/m³ halen als de volgende maatregelen worden toegepast: 

a. Aparte opvang van de emissie bij laden en lossen; en  

b. Gebruik van een doekfilter of een elektrostatische stofvanger in combinatie met kooksinjectie.    

### 33  

De materiaaltoevoer voor vlamboogovens bevat vaak olie, emulsies of vet. Algemene primaire maatregelen voor de beperking van PCDD/F kunnen zijn: sorteren, ontoliën en verwijdering van de coating van schroot dat kunststoffen, rubber, verf, pigmenten en vulkaniseeradditieven kan bevatten.  

#### *Smelterijen in de secundaire aluminiumindustrie* 

### 34  

De PCDD/F-emissie van smelterijen in de secundaire aluminiumindustrie liggen ongeveer tussen 0,1 en 14 ng TE/m³ . De concentratie is afhankelijk van de aard van het smeltaggregaat, de gebruikte materialen en de gehanteerde technieken voor rookgaszuivering.  

### 35  

In het algemeen zorgen één- en meerfasendoekfilters, aangevuld met kalksteen/actieve kool/kool uit martinovens vóór het filter, voor een concentratie van maximaal 0,1 ng TE/m³ met een reductie-efficiëntie van 99%.3 met een reductie-efficiëntie van 99%.  

### 36  

Ook de volgende maatregelen komen in aanmerking: 

a. Minimalisering en aparte verwijdering en zuivering van anders verontreinigde rookgasstromen;  

b. Vermijding van de depositie van deeltjes uit rookgassen;  

c. Een snelle passage van het kritisch temperatuurtraject;  

d. Een betere voorsortering van aluminiumschroot uit shredders met behulp van zink/drijfscheidingstechnieken en scheiding door wervelstroomdepositie; en  

e. Verbetering van de reiniging vooraf van aluminiumschroot door de verwijdering van de coating en het drogen van spanen.    

### 37  

De mogelijkheden d en e zijn belangrijk omdat het onwaarschijnlijk is dat bij moderne smelttechnieken zonder toeslag (waarbij geen halogeniden worden gebruikt) het laagwaardige schroot kan worden verwerkt dat in draaitrommelovens kan worden gebruikt.  

### 38  

In het kader van het Verdrag inzake de bescherming van het mariene milieu in het Noordoostelijk deel van de Atlantische Oceaan zijn er besprekingen aan de gang over de herziening van een eerdere aanbeveling om het gebruik van hexachloorethaan in de aluminiumindustrie geleidelijk te staken.  

### 39  

De smelt kan met geavanceerde technologie worden behandeld, zoals stikstof/chloormengsels in een verhouding tussen 9:1 en 8:2, gasinjectieapparatuur voor fijne dispersie en stikstofspoeling vooraf en achteraf en vacuümontvetting. Bij stikstof/chloormengsels is een PCDD/F-concentratie van ongeveer 0,03 ng TE/m³ gemeten (vergeleken met meer dan 1 ng TE/m³ bij behandeling met uitsluitend chloor). Chloor is nodig voor de verwijdering van magnesium en andere ongewenste bestanddelen.  

### C  

####Verbranding van fossiele brandstoffen bij elektriciteitsfabrieken en in de industrie

### 40  

Bij de verbranding van fossiele brandstoffen bij elektriciteitsbedrijven en in de industrie (stookketels met een thermische capaciteit van meer dan 50 MW) zullen een verbeterde energie-efficiëntie en energiebesparing leiden tot een daling van de emissie van alle verontreinigende stoffen omdat er minder brandstof nodig is. Dit zal ook leiden tot een daling van de PCDD/F-emissie. Verwijdering van chloor uit kolen of olie is niet kosteneffectief, maar de tendens in de richting van gasgestookte installaties zorgt toch voor een daling van de PCDD/F-emissie in deze sector.  

### 41  

Er dient te worden opgemerkt dat de PCDD/F-emissie significant zou kunnen stijgen als afvalstoffen (zuiveringsslib, afgewerkte olie, rubberafval enz.) aan de brandstof wordt toegevoegd. De verbranding van afval voor de energievoorziening mag uitsluitend gebeuren in installaties met systemen voor rookgaszuivering die voor een zeer efficiënte verwijdering van PCDD/F zorgen (beschreven in deel A).  

### 42  

Het gebruik van technieken om de emissie van stikstofoxiden, zwaveldioxide en deeltjes in de rookgassen te beperken kan ook zorgen voor een beperking van de PCDD/F-emissie. Bij het gebruik van deze technieken zal de efficiëntie van de PCDD/F-verwijdering van installatie tot installatie verschillen. Er wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de ontwikkeling van technieken voor PCDD/F-verwijdering, maar zolang deze technieken nog niet op industriële schaal beschikbaar zijn, wordt er geen beste beschikbare techniek gespecificeerd voor PCDD/F-verwijdering.  

### D  

####Huisverwarmingsinstallaties

### 43  

De bijdrage van huisverwarmingsinstallaties tot de totale PCDD/F-emissie is minder significant wanneer op een correcte wijze gebruik wordt gemaakt van goedgekeurde brandstoffen. Daarnaast kunnen er grote regionale verschillen in de emissie optreden die veroorzaakt worden door de aard en de kwaliteit van de brandstof en de geografische dichtheid en het gebruik van de installatie.  

### 44  

Koolwaterstoffen in brandstoffen en verbrandingsgassen worden in huisverwarmingsinstallaties minder volledig verbrand dan in grote stookinstallaties. Dit is vooral het geval wanneer er gebruik wordt gemaakt van vaste brandstoffen zoals hout of kolen, waarbij de PCDD/F-concentratie in de rookgassen tussen 0,1 en 0,7 ng TE/m³ ligt.  

### 45  

Wanneer verpakkingsmateriaal tegelijk met vaste brandstoffen wordt verbrand, stijgt de PCDD/F-emissie. Het komt voor dat er in particuliere woningen afval en verpakkingsmateriaal wordt verbrand, ook al is dit in sommige landen verboden. Het staat wel vast dat huisvuil vanwege de stijgende verwijderingskosten in huisverwarmingsinstallaties wordt verbrand. Wanneer daarbij hout met verpakkingsafval wordt gebruikt, kan de PCDD/F-emissie stijgen van 0,06 ng TE/m³ (uitsluitend hout) tot 8 ng TE/m³ (bij 11 volumeprocent O <sub>2</sub>). Deze resultaten zijn bevestigd door onderzoek in verschillende landen waar in de verbrandingsgassen van huisverwarmingsinstallaties waar afval wordt verbrand, concentraties tot 114 ng TE/m³ (bij 13 volumeprocent zuurstof) zijn gemeten.  

### 46  

De emissie door huisverwarmingsinstallaties kan worden beperkt door uitsluitend brandstof van goede kwaliteit te gebruiken en geen afval, halogeenhoudende kunststoffen en ander materiaal te verbranden. Voorlichtingsprogramma's die gericht zijn op de kopers/gebruikers van huisverwarmingsinstallaties kunnen hierbij goede diensten bewijzen.  

### E  

####Verbrandingsinstallaties voor hout (capaciteit < 50 MW)

### 47  

Uit metingen bij houtverbrandingsinstallaties blijkt dat PCDD/F-concentraties boven 0,1 ng TE/m³ in de verbrandingsgassen voorkomen, met name bij onvolledige verbranding en/of wanneer de verbrande stoffen een hoger gehalte aan chloorhoudende verbindingen hebben dan normaal onbehandeld hout. De totale koolstofconcentratie in de verbrandingsgassen geeft een indicatie omtrent een eventuele slechte verbranding. Er is een correlatie gevonden tussen de CO-emissie, de volledigheid van de verbranding en de PCDD/F-emissie. Tabel 3 bevat een overzicht met enkele emissieconcentraties en -factoren voor houtverbrandingsinstallaties. 
###*Tabel 3:* Gekwantificeerde emissieconcentraties en -factoren voor houtverbrandingsinstallaties

| Brandstof  | Emissie-concentratie (ng TE/m³ )  | Emissie-factor (ng TE/kg)  | Emissie-factor (ng/GJ)  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Onbewerkt hout (beukenhout)  | 0,02 - 0,10  | 0,23 - 1,3  | 12 - 70  |
| Onbewerkte houtsnippers uit bossen  | 0,07 - 0,21  | 0,79 - 2,6  | 43 - 140  |
| Spaanplaat  | 0,02 - 0,08  | 0,29 - 0,9  | 16 - 50  |
| Stedelijk afvalhout  | 2,7 - 14,4  | 26 - 173  | 1400 - 9400  |
| Huisvuil  | 114  | 3230  | --- |
| Houtskool  | 0,03  | --- | --- |

### 48  

De verbranding van stedelijk afvalhout (sloophout) in bewegende roosters leidt tot een betrekkelijk hoge PCDD/F-emissie in vergelijking met ander hout dat geen afval is. Als primaire maatregel om de emissie te beperken kan ervoor worden gezorgd dat behandeld afvalhout niet in houtverbrandingsinstallaties wordt verbrand. De verbranding van behandeld hout moet uitsluitend in installaties met een adequate rookgasreiniging gebeuren om de PCDD/F-emissie tot een minimum te beperken.  

### V  

####TECHNIEKEN VOOR DE BEPERKING VAN DE PAK-EMISSIE

### A  

####Kooksproductie

### 49  

Bij de productie van kooks komen PAK's met name in de buitenlucht terecht: 

a. Bij het laden van de oven door de vulgaten;  

b. Door lekkage via de ovendeur, de klimpijpen en de deksels van de vulgaten; en  

c. Bij het leegdrukken van de oven en het afkoelen van de kooks.    

### 50  

Qua concentratie van benzo(a)pyreen (BaP) lopen de verschillende bronnen in een kooksbatterij sterk uiteen. De hoogste BaP-concentraties worden aan de bovenkant van de batterij en in de directe omgeving van de deuren gemeten.  

### 51  

De PAK-emissie bij de kooksproductie kan worden beperkt door de bestaande geïntegreerde ijzer- en staalfabrieken technisch te verbeteren. Dit kan betekenen dat oude kooksbatterijen worden gesloten en vervangen en dat de kooksproductie in zijn algemeenheid afneemt ten gunste van bijvoorbeeld de injectie van hoogwaardige kolen bij de staalproductie.  

### 52  

Een strategie ter beperking van de PAK-emissie door kooksbatterijen moet onder andere de volgende technische maatregelen omvatten: 

a. Vullen van de kooksovens: 

– Beperking van de deeltjesemissie bij het laden van de kolen uit de bunker in de vulwagens;  

– Gesloten systemen voor de verplaatsing van kolen wanneer gebruik wordt gemaakt van voorverwarming van kolen;  

– Afzuiging en daarna behandeling van de vulgassen, hetzij door de gassen in de dichtstbijzijnde oven te brengen, hetzij door ze via een verzamelleiding naar een naverbrander en vervolgens een stofafscheider te transporteren. In sommige gevallen kunnen de opgevangen vulgassen op de vulwagens worden verbrand, maar deze op vulwagens gebaseerde systemen leveren voor het milieu en qua veiligheid minder goede resultaten op. Door stoom- of waterinjectie in de klimpijpen moet voor voldoende zuiging worden gezorgd;    

b. Emissie bij de deksels van de vulgaten tijdens de verkooksing moet worden voorkomen door: 

– Het gebruik van vulgatdeksels die zeer goed afsluiten;  

– Afdichting van de vulgatdeksels met klei (of een even effectief materiaal) na iedere vulling;  

– Reiniging van de vulgatdeksels en -ringen voordat de vulgaten gesloten worden;  

– Zorgen dat de bovenkant van de oven vrij van kolenresten blijft;    

c. De deksels van de klimpijpen moeten van watersloten worden voorzien om te voorkomen dat gas en teer ontsnapt en de sloten moeten geregeld worden gereinigd om te zorgen dat ze goed blijven functioneren;  

d. De installatie om de kooksovendeuren te bedienen moet worden voorzien van systemen om het oppervlak van de afsluitingen op de deuren en deurramen van de oven te reinigen;  

e. Kooksovendeuren: 

– Er moet een zeer goede afdichting worden gebruikt (b.v. membraandeuren onder veerdruk);  

– De afdichting op de ovendeuren en de deurramen moet na ieder gebruik grondig worden gereinigd;  

– De deuren moeten zodanig worden ontworpen dat er een systeem voor het opvangen van deeltjes kan worden geïnstalleerd dat (via een verzamelleiding) bij het leegdrukken op een stofvanginstallatie kan worden aangesloten;    

f. De kookstransportmachine moet worden voorzien van een vaste afzuigkap, een vaste afvoerleiding en een vast gasreinigingssysteem (bij voorkeur een doekfilter);  

g. Bij het kooksblussen moeten emissiearme procedures worden gevolgd, bijvoorbeeld droge kooksblussing. Het verdient de voorkeur een nat blusprocédé te vervangen door droge kooksblussing, mits er een systeem met een gesloten circulatie wordt gebruikt om te voorkomen dat er afvalwater ontstaat. De hoeveelheid stof die bij de verwerking van droog gebluste kooks ontstaat, moet worden beperkt.    

### 53  

Het zogenaamde „non-recovery-cokemaking" proces emitteert aanzienlijk minder PAK dan het gangbaarder procédé met terugwinning van de bijproducten. Dit komt doordat er in dat geval een onderdruk in de oven heerst, zodat lekkage via de kooksovendeuren naar de buitenlucht onmogelijk is. Bij het verkooksen wordt het ruwgas uit de oven verwijderd door een natuurlijke trek, die voor een onderdruk in de oven zorgt. Deze ovens zijn niet geschikt voor de terugwinning van de chemische bijproducten uit ruwgas. In plaats daarvan worden de rookgassen van het verkooksingsproces (met PAK's) efficiënt verbrand bij hoge temperaturen en een lange verblijftijd. De afvalwarmte van deze verbranding wordt gebruikt voor de energievoorziening bij het verkooksen en het warmteoverschot kan worden gebruikt om stoom te maken. Met het oog op het rendement van dit verkooksingsprocédé is wellicht een installatie voor warmtekrachtkoppeling nodig om met de overmaat stoom elektriciteit op te kunnen wekken. Momenteel draait er slechts één kooksfabriek zonder terugwinning in de Verenigde Staten en één in Australië. Het procédé komt neer op een horizontale kameroven zonder terugwinning met een verbrandingskamer tussen twee ovens. De twee ovens worden om en om gevuld en verkookst. Zo is er altijd één oven die de verbrandingskamer van kooksovengas voorziet. De benodigde warmtebron wordt geleverd door de verbranding van kooksovengas in de verbrandingskamer. Het ontwerp van de verbrandingskamer zorgt voor de benodigde verblijfstijd (ongeveer 1 seconde) en hoge temperaturen (minimaal 900°C).  

### 54  

Er moet een effectief programma worden gebruikt voor de controle op lekkages uit de afdichting van de kooksovendeuren, de klimpijpen en de vulgatdeksels. Dit betekent controle op en registratie van lekkages met onmiddellijk herstel of onderhoud. Op deze manier kan een significante beperking van de diffuse emissie worden verwezenlijkt.  

### 55  

Aanpassing van bestaande kooksbatterijen om de condensatie van rookgassen uit alle bronnen (met warmteterugwinning) te vergemakkelijken zorgt voor een daling van de PAK-emissie in de lucht met 86 tot meer dan 90% (afvalwaterzuivering niet meegerekend). Rekening houdend met de teruggewonnen energie, het verwarmde water, het synthesegas en het bespaarde koelwater kunnen de investeringskosten in vijf jaar worden afgeschreven.  

### 56  

Bij een stijging van het volume van de kooksoven daalt het totale aantal ovens, het aantal keren dat de ovendeur wordt geopend (het aantal leeggedrukte ovens per dag), het aantal afdichtingen in een kooksbatterij en derhalve de PAK-emissie. Door een daling van de bedrijfs- en personeelskosten neemt ook de productiviteit toe.  

### 57  

Droge kooksblussystemen vereisten hogere investeringen dan natte methoden. De hogere bedrijfskosten kunnen worden gecompenseerd door de terugwinning van warmte die voor de oorverwarming van de kolen kan worden gebruikt. De energie-efficiëntie van een gecombineerd systeem met droge kooksblussing en voorverwarming van de kolen stijgt van 38 tot 65%. Door voorverwarming van de kolen neemt de productiviteit met 30% toe. Dit kan tot 40% worden opgevoerd omdat het verkooksingsproces homogener verloopt.  

### 58  

Alle tanks en installaties voor de opslag en behandeling van koolteer en koolteerproducten moeten worden voorzien van een efficiënte dampretourleiding en/of een dampafbraaksysteem. De bedrijfskosten van dampafbraaksystemen kunnen bij een autonoom naverbrandingsprocédé worden beperkt als de concentratie van de koolstofverbindingen in het afval hoog genoeg is.  

### 59  

Tabel 4 geeft een overzicht van de maatregelen ter beperking van de PAK-emissie bij de kooksproductie. 
###*Tabel 4:* Beperking van de PAK-emissie bij de kooksproductie

| Mogelijkheden  | Emissieniveau (%)  <sup> 1   Restemissie in vergelijking met emissie zonder maatregelen.    </sup> | Geraamde kosten  | Risico's  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Aanpassing van oude installaties met condensatie van de rookgassen uit alle bronnen omvat de volgende maatregelen:  | Totaal < 10 (zonder afvalwater)  | Hoog  | Zeer hoge emissie in afvalwater bij nat blussen. Deze methode mag alleen worden toegepast als het water in een gesloten systeem opnieuw wordt gebruikt.  |
| – Opvanging en naverbranding van de vulgassen bij het vullen van ovens of transport van de gassen naar de dichtstbijzijnde oven, voor zover mogelijk;  | 5  | (Rekening houdend met de terugwinning van energie, warm water, synthesegas en besparingen op koelwater kunnen de investeringskosten in 5 jaar worden afgeschreven).  | --- |
| – De emissie bij vulgatdeksels moet zoveel mogelijk worden voorkomen, bijvoorbeeld door een speciale constructie van de deksels en zeer effectieve afdichtingsmethoden. Kooksovendeuren moeten een zeer effectieve afdichting hebben. Vóór het sluiten van de vulgaten moeten de vulgatdeksels en -ringen worden gereinigd;  | < 5  | --- | --- |

| Emissiearme procedures voor het blussen van kooks, bijvoorbeeld droog kooksblussen.  | Geen emissie in water  | Hogere investeringskosten dan bij nat blussen (maar lagere kosten door het voorverwarmen van kolen en het gebruik van afvalwarmte).  | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intensiever gebruik van ovens met een hoog volume om de oven minder vaak te hoeven openen en het oppervlak van de afdichtingen te beperken.  | Aanzienlijk  | Investeringen ongeveer 10% hoger dan bij klassieke installaties.  | Meestal moet de kooksfabriek volledig worden aangepast of moet er een nieuwe kooksfabriek worden gebouwd.  |

### B  

####Anodeproductie

### 60  

De PAK-emissie bij de productie van anodes moet op een soortgelijke manier worden aangepakt als bij de productie van kooks.  

### 61  

Om de emissie van stof dat met PAK's verontreinigd is te beperken worden de volgende secundaire maatregelen gebruikt: 

a. Elektrostatische teerafscheiding;  

b. Combinatie van een klassieke elektrostatische teerafscheider met een natte elektrostatische afscheider om de efficiëntie te verhogen;  

c. Thermische naverbranding van de afvalgassen; en  

d. Droge gasreiniging met kalksteen/petroleumkooks of aluminiumoxide (Al <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub>).    

### 62  

De bedrijfskosten bij thermische naverbranding kunnen worden beperkt door autotherme naverbranding als de concentratie van de koolstofverbindingen in de rookgassen hoog genoeg is. Tabel 5 bevat een overzicht van de maatregelen ter beperking van de PAK-emissie bij de anodeproductie. 
###*Tabel 5:* Beperking van de PAK-emissie bij de anodeproductie

| Mogelijkheden  | Emissieniveau (%)  <sup> 1   Restemissie in vergelijking met emissie zonder maatregelen.    </sup> | Geraamde kosten  | Risico's  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Modernisering van oude installaties door beperking van de diffuse emissie met de volgende maatregelen:  | 3 - 10  | Hoog  | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| – Beperking van de lekkage;  | --- | --- | --- |
| – Installatie van flexibele afdichtingen bij de ovendeuren;  | --- | --- | --- |

### C  

####Aluminiumindustrie

### 63  

Aluminium wordt vervaardigd uit aluminiumoxide (AL <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub>) door elektrolyse in elektrisch in serie geschakelde cellen. De cellen worden afhankelijk van de aard van de anode ingedeeld als „Prebake" of Soederberg-cel.  

### 64  

„Prebake" cellen hebben anodes die bestaan uit gecalcineerde (gebakken) koolblokken die na gedeeltelijk verbruik worden vervangen. Soederberg-anodes worden in de cel gebakken met een mengsel van petroleumkooks en koolteerpek als bindmiddel.  

### 65  

De PAK-emissie is bij het Soederbergprocédé erg hoog. Primaire bestrijdingsmaatregelen zijn bijvoorbeeld modernisering van bestaande installaties en optimalisering van de processen, waardoor de PAK-emissie met 70-90% kan worden teruggedrongen. Een emissieniveau van 0,015 kg B(a)P/ton Al is haalbaar. Vervanging van de bestaande Soederberg-cellen door „Prebake" cellen zou een ingrijpende omschakeling van het huidige procédé vergen, maar zou betekenen dat de PAK-emissie vrijwel verdwijnt. De investeringskosten van een dergelijke vervanging zijn zeer hoog.  

### 66  

Tabel 6 bevat een overzicht van de maatregelen ter beperking van de PAK-emissie voor de aluminiumproductie. 
###*Tabel 6:* Beperking van de PAK-emissie bij de aluminiumproductie met het Soederberg-proces

| Mogelijkheden  | Emissieniveau (%)  <sup> 1   Restemissie in vergelijking met emissie zonder maatregelen.    </sup> | Geraamde kosten  | Risico's  |

| Vervanging van de Soederberg-elektrodes door:  | --- | --- | --- |
| – „Prebake" elektrodes (zonder gebruik van pekbindmiddelen);  | 3 - 30  | Hogere kosten voor elektrodes ongeveer 800 miljoen USD  | Soederberg-elektrodes zijn goedkoper dan „Prebake" elektrodes, omdat er geen installatie nodig is voor het bakken van anodes.  |
| – Inerte anodes  | --- | --- | Het onderzoek vordert, maar de verwachtingen zijn niet hoog gespannen.  |

### D  

####Huisverwarmingsinstallaties

### 67  

Bij huisverwarmingsinstallaties zoals kachels of open haarden kan PAK-emissie worden waargenomen, vooral wanneer hout of kolen worden gebruikt. Huishoudens kunnen een belangrijke bron van PAK-emissie zijn. Dit komt door het gebruik van open haarden en kleine stookinstallaties waar vaste brandstoffen worden verbrand. In sommige landen worden als brandstof voor kachels meestal kolen gebruikt. Kachels waarin kolen worden verbrand hebben een lagere PAK-emissie dan kachels waarin hout wordt verbrand, omdat de verbrandingstemperatuur hoger is en de brandstofkwaliteit consistenter.  

### 68  

Bovendien zijn er verbrandingssystemen met geoptimaliseerde functionele karakteristieken (b.v. de verbrandingssnelheid) die zorgen voor een effectieve beperking van de PAK-emissie door huisverwarmingsinstallaties. Geoptimaliseerde verbrandingsomstandigheden omvatten een geoptimaliseerd ontwerp van de verbrandingskamer en een geoptimaliseerde luchttoevoer. Er zijn verschillende technieken waarmee de verbrandingsomstandigheden worden geoptimaliseerd en de emissie wordt beperkt. Wat de emissie betreft zijn er significante verschillen tussen de verschillende technieken. Een moderne houtverbrandingsketel met een wateropvangtank, hetgeen overeenkomt met de BBT, zorgt voor een emissiebeperking met meer dan 90% in vergelijking met een ouderwetse ketel zonder wateropvangtank. Een moderne ketel heeft drie verschillende zones: een stookzone voor de vergassing van hout, een gasverbrandingszone met keramiek of een ander materiaal dat temperaturen tot zo'n 1000°C mogelijk maakt, en een convectiezone. De convectiezone, waar de warmte door het water wordt geabsorbeerd, moet zo lang en effectief zijn dat de gastemperatuur van 1000°C tot 250°C of minder kan dalen. Er zijn ook verschillende technieken om oude en verouderde ketels te voorzien van bijvoorbeeld wateropvangtanks, keramische bekleding en pellet-branders.  

### 69  

Een geoptimaliseerde verbrandingssnelheid gaat gepaard met een lage emissie van koolmonoxide (CO), de totale hoeveelheid koolwaterstoffen (TKW) en PAK's. De vaststelling van grenswaarden (regelingen voor typegoedkeuring) voor de emissie van CO en TKW heeft ook gevolgen voor de PAK-emissie. Bij een lage emissie van CO en TKW is ook de PAK-emissie laag. Aangezien PAK-metingen veel duurder zijn dan CO-metingen, is de vaststelling van een grenswaarde voor CO en TKW kosteneffectiever. Er wordt gewerkt aan een voorstel voor een CEN-norm voor kolen- en houtverbrandingsketels tot 300 kW (zie tabel 7).

### 70  

De emissie van houtkachels voor woningen kan worden beperkt: 

a. Voor bestaande kachels door voorlichtings- en bewustmakingsprogramma's om de gebruikers ervan te doordringen dat de kachels goed moeten worden gebruikt, dat uitsluitend onbehandeld hout moet worden gebruikt, dat een goede voorbereiding van de brandstof nodig is en dat het hout voldoende moet worden gedroogd;  

b. Voor nieuwe kachels door de toepassing van productnormen, zoals beschreven in het ontwerp van de CEN-norm (en gelijkwaardige productnormen in de Verenigde Staten en Canada).    

### 71  

Voor de beperking van de PAK-emissie kunnen ook meer algemene maatregelen worden genomen, zoals de ontwikkeling van gecentraliseerde systemen voor huishoudens en energiebesparing door bijvoorbeeld verbeterde thermische isolatie om het energieverbruik terug te dringen.

####Installaties voor houtverduurzaming

### 73  

Houtverduurzaming met PAK-houdende koolteerproducten kan een belangrijke bron van PAK-emissie in de lucht zijn. De emissie kan zich voordoen tijdens het impregneerproces zelf en tijdens de opslag, de bewerking en het gebruik van het geïmpregneerde hout in de open lucht.  

### 74  

De meest gebruikte PAK-houdende koolteerproducten zijn carbolineum en creosoot. Dit zijn beide PAK-houdende koolteerdestillaten voor de bescherming van hout tegen biologische aantasting.  

### 75  

De PAK-emissie door houtverduurzaming, installaties en opslagplaatsen, kan op verschillende manieren worden beperkt, afzonderlijk of gecombineerd ingevoerd, zoals: 

a. Voorschriften voor de opslagomstandigheden om de verontreiniging van bodem en oppervlaktewater door PAK-uitloging en verontreinigd regenwater te voorkomen (b.v. regendichte opslagplaatsen, dakbedekking, hergebruik van verontreinigd water bij het impregneerproces, kwaliteitseisen voor het vervaardigde materiaal);  

b. Maatregelen om de emissie in de lucht bij impregneerinstallaties te beperken (zo zou het warme hout van 90°C tot maximaal 30°C moeten worden afgekoeld voordat het naar opslagplaatsen wordt overgebracht. Een andere methode waarbij het hout onder vacuümomstandigheden met behulp van stoom onder druk met creosoot wordt geïmpregneerd, moet echter als BBT worden geaccentueerd);  

c. Een optimale dosering van houtverduurzamingsmiddel, waarbij het behandelde houtproduct in situ een adequate bescherming krijgt, kan als BBT worden beschouwd aangezien de behoefte aan vervanging daardoor wordt beperkt, hetgeen leidt tot een daling van de emissie door installaties voor houtverduurzaming;  

d. Gebruik van houtverduurzamingsmiddelen met een lager gehalte aan PAK's die tot de POP's behoren: 

– Mogelijk gebruik van gewijzigd creosoot, zijnde een destilleerfractie met kookpunt tussen 270°C en 355°C, waardoor de emissie van zowel de vluchtigere PAK's als de zwaardere toxischere PAK's wordt beperkt;  

– Ontmoediging van het gebruik van carbolineum zorgt ook voor een beperking van de PAK-emissie;    

e. Evaluatie en vervolgens eventueel gebruik van alternatieven, zoals vermeld in tabel 9, waardoor het gebruik van PAK-houdende producten tot een minimum wordt beperkt.    

### 76  

Verbranding van geïmpregneerd hout leidt tot de emissie van PAK's en andere schadelijke stoffen. Als dit hout wordt verbrand, moet het in installaties met adequate zuiveringstechnieken gebeuren. 
###*Tabel 9:* Mogelijke alternatieven voor houtverduurzaming met PAK-houdende producten

| Mogelijkheden  | Risico's  |
|:---|:---|
| Gebruik van andere materialen:  | andere milieuproblemen moeten worden geëvalueerd, zoals:  |
| – duurzaam geproduceerd hardhout (rivieroevers, omheiningen, poorten);  | – beschikbaarheid van op de juiste wijze geproduceerd hout;  |
| – kunststof (palen voor de tuinbouw);  | --- |
| – beton (dwarsliggers voor de spoorwegen);  | --- |
| – natuurlijke in plaats van kunstmatige constructies (rivieroevers, omheiningen enz.);  | – emissie die ontstaat bij de productie en verwijdering van kunststoffen, met name PVC.  |
| – onbehandeld hout.  | --- |
| Er zijn verschillende andere houtverduurzamingstechnieken in ontwikkeling waarbij geen impregnering met PAK-houdende producten plaatsvindt.  | --- |

####BEPERKING VAN GEHALOGENEERDE LOODVANGERS, ADDITIEVEN IN BRANDSTOFFEN EN SMEERMIDDELEN

### 6  

In sommige landen wordt 1,2-dibroommethaan in combinatie met 1,2-dichloormethaan als loodvanger in gelode benzine gebruikt. Bovendien ontstaat er tijdens het verbrandingsproces in de motor PCDD/F. Voor de toepassing van driewegkatalysatoren in auto's moet er ongelode benzine worden gebruikt. De toevoeging van loodvangers en andere gehalogeneerde verbindingen aan benzine en andere brandstoffen en aan smeermiddelen moet zo veel mogelijk worden vermeden.  

### 7

### III  

####MAATREGELEN TER BEPERKING VAN DE EMISSIE VAN POP'S DOOR MOBIELE BRONNEN

### A  

####Emissie van POP's door motorvoertuigen

### 8  

De POP-emissie door motorvoertuigen doet zich voor in de vorm van aan deeltjes gebonden PAK's die door voertuigen met een dieselmotor worden uitgestoten. PAK's worden ook uitgestoten door voertuigen met benzinemotor, maar in mindere mate.  

### 9  

Smeerolie en brandstoffen kunnen door het gebruik van additieven of door het productieprocédé gehalogeneerde verbindingen bevatten. Deze verbindingen kunnen tijdens de verbranding in PCDD/F worden omgezet die vervolgens met de uitlaatgassen worden uitgestoten.  

### B  

####Keuring en onderhoud

### 10  

Voor mobiele bronnen met dieselmotor kan de effectiviteit van de emissiebeperking van PAK's worden gewaarborgd door programma's om de mobiele bronnen periodiek te keuren op de emissie van deeltjes, de opaciteit bij vrije acceleratie of gelijkwaardige methoden.  

### 11  

Voor mobiele bronnen met benzinemotor kan de effectiviteit van de emissiebeperking van PAK's (naast andere bestanddelen van de uitlaatgassen) worden gewaarborgd door programma's voor een periodieke keuring van de brandstofregeling en de efficiëntie van de katalysator.  

### C  

####Technieken voor de beperking van de PAK-emissie door motorvoertuigen met diesel- en benzinemotor

### 1  

####Algemene aspecten van de gebruikte technologie

### 12  

Het is belangrijk ervoor te zorgen dat de voertuigen zodanig worden ontworpen dat zij tijdens het gebruik aan de emissienormen voldoen. Dit kan gebeuren door waarborging van de conformiteit van de productie, levenslange duurzaamheid, kwaliteitsgarantie voor onderdelen voor emissieregulering en het terughalen van voertuigen die gebreken vertonen. Bij gebruikte voertuigen kan door een effectief keurings- en onderhoudsprogramma worden gewaarborgd dat zij aan de normen voor emissiebeperking blijven voldoen.  

### 2  

####Technische maatregelen ter beperking van de emissie

### 13  

De volgende maatregelen ter beperking van de PAK-emissie zijn belangrijk: 

a. Specificaties voor de brandstofkwaliteit en wijzigingen in de motoren om de emissie te beperken voordat deze ontstaat (primaire maatregelen); en  

b. Toevoeging van systemen om de uitlaatgassen te reinigen, zoals oxidatiekatalysatoren of deeltjesvangers (secundaire maatregelen).    

### a  

#### *Dieselmotoren* 

### 14  

Wijziging van dieselbrandstof kan twee positieve effecten hebben: door een lager zwavelgehalte worden er minder deeltjes uitgestoten en wordt het omzettingsrendement van oxidatiekatalysatoren opgevoerd en door een beperking van de hoeveelheid di- en tricyclische aromaten worden er minder PAK's gevormd en uitgestoten.  

### 15  

Een primaire maatregel om de emissie te beperken is wijziging van de motor om voor een vollediger verbranding te zorgen. Er zijn veel verschillende wijzigingen in gebruik. In het algemeen wordt de samenstelling van de uitlaatgassen beïnvloed door wijzigingen in het ontwerp van de verbrandingskamer en door een hogere druk bij de brandstofinspuiting. Op dit moment worden in de meeste dieselmotoren mechanische regelsystemen gebruikt. In nieuwere motoren worden steeds vaker geautomatiseerde elektronische regelsystemen gebruikt die meer flexibiliteit bij de regulering van de emissie mogelijk maken. Een andere technologie om de emissie te beperken is een combinatie van uitlaatgasturbo en tussenkoeling. Dit systeem leidt tot een beperking van de NO <sub>x</sub> -emissie, brandstofbesparing en een toename van het afgegeven vermogen. Voor zware en lichte motoren is ook het gebruik van inlaatspruitstukafstelling een mogelijkheid.  

### 16  

Smeeroliebeperking is belangrijk om de verontreiniging door zwevende deeltjes terug te dringen, aangezien 10 tot 50% van de deeltjes uit motorolie ontstaat. Het olieverbruik kan worden beperkt door verbetering van de fabricagespecificaties voor motoren en door een betere afdichting van de motoren.  

### 17  

Secundaire maatregelen om de emissie te beperken houden in dat er systemen voor de behandeling van uitlaatgassen worden toegevoegd. In het algemeen is gebleken dat het gebruik van een oxidatiekatalysator in combinatie met een deeltjesfilter voor dieselmotoren goede resultaten oplevert bij de beperking van de PAK-emissie. Er wordt momenteel gewerkt aan de evaluatie van een deeltjesvanger-oxidator. Deze wordt aangebracht in het uitlaatsysteem voor het opvangen van zwevende deeltjes en kan tot op zekere hoogte zorgen voor regeneratie van het filter door verbranding van de opgevangen deeltjes met behulp van elektrische verwarming van het systeem of door een andere regeneratiemethode. Voor een echte regeneratie van passieve deeltjesvangers tijdens normaal gebruik is een regeneratiesysteem met een brander nodig of moeten additieven worden gebruikt.  

### b  

#### *Benzinemotoren* 

### 18  

PAK-beperkende maatregelen voor benzinemotoren zijn vooral gebaseerd op het gebruik van een driewegkatalysator met gesloten systeem, waardoor de emissie van koolwaterstoffen in het algemeen en dus ook van PAK's wordt beperkt.  

### 19  

Door een verbetering van het gedrag bij een koude start wordt de emissie van organische verbindingen in het algemeen en PAK's in het bijzonder beperkt (bijvoorbeeld startkatalysatoren, betere brandstofverdamping/verstuiving, verwarmde katalysatoren).  

### 20  

Tabel 2 bevat een overzicht van de maatregelen ter beperking van de PAK-emissie in de uitlaatgassen van motorvoertuigen voor het wegverkeer.
