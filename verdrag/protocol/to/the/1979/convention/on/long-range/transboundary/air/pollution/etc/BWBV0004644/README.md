##Protocol bij het Verdrag van 1979 betreffende grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging over lange afstand inzake de verdergaande vermindering van zwavelemissies

####Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution on further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions

The Parties, Determined to implement the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, Concerned that emissions of sulphur and other air pollutants continue to be transported across international boundaries and, in exposed parts of Europe and North America, are causing widespread damage to natural resources of vital environmental and economic importance, such as forests, soils and waters, and to materials, including historic monuments, and, under certain circumstances, have harmful effects on human health, Resolved to take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize emissions of air pollutants and mitigate their adverse effects, Convinced that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that such precautionary measures to deal with emissions of air pollutants should be cost-effective, Mindful that measures to control emissions of sulphur and other air pollutants would also contribute to the protection of the sensitive Arctic environment, Considering that the predominant sources of air pollution contributing to the acidification of the environment are the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, and the main technological processes in various industrial sectors, as well as transport, which lead to emissions of sulphur, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants, Conscious of the need for a cost-effective regional approach to combating air pollution that takes account of the variations in effects and abatement costs between countries, Desiring to take further and more effective action to control and reduce sulphur emissions, Cognizant that any sulphur control policy, however cost-effective it may be at the regional level, will result in a relatively heavy economic burden on countries with economies that are in transition to a market economy, Bearing in mind that measures taken to reduce sulphur emissions should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international competition and trade, Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on emissions, atmospheric processes and effects on the environment of sulphur oxides, as well as on abatement costs, Aware that, in addition to emissions of sulphur, emissions of nitrogen oxides and of ammonia are also causing acidification of the environment, Noting that under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in New York on 9 May 1992, there is agreement to establish national policies and take corresponding measures to combat climate change, which can be expected to lead to reductions of sulphur emissions, Affirming the need to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable development, Recognizing the need to continue scientific and technical cooperation to elaborate further the approach based on critical loads and critical levels, including efforts to assess several air pollutants and various effects on the environment, materials and human health, Underlining that scientific and technical knowledge is developing and that it will be necessary to take such developments into account when reviewing the adequacy of the obligations entered into under the present Protocol and deciding on further action, Acknowledging the Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions or Their Transboundary Fluxes by at least 30 per cent, adopted in Helsinki on 8 July 1985, and the measures already taken by many countries which have had the effect of reducing sulphur emissions,   Have agreed as follows:

<sup>a)</sup> If, in a given year before 2005, a Party finds that, due to a particularly cold winter, a particularly dry summer and un unforeseen short-term loss of capacity in the power supply system, domestically or in a neighbouring country, it cannot comply with its obligations under this annex, it may fulfil those obligations by averaging its national annual sulphur emissions for the year in question, the year preceding that year and the year following it, provided that the emission level in any single year is not more than 20% above the sulphur emission ceiling.

### Annex  IV  

####Control technologies for sulphur emissions from stationary sources

### 1  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

The aim of this annex is to provide guidance for identifying sulphur control options and technologies for giving effect to the obligations of the present Protocol.  

### 2  

The annex is based on information on general options for the reduction of sulphur emissions and in particular on emission control technology performance and costs contained in official documentation of the Executive Body and its subsidiary bodies.  

### 3  

Unless otherwise indicated, the reduction measures listed are considered, on the basis of operational experience of several years in most cases, to be the most well-established and economically feasible best available technologies. However, the continuously expanding experience of low-emission measures and technologies at new plants as well as of the retrofitting of existing plants will necessitate regular review of this annex.  

### 4  

Although the annex lists a number of measures and technologies spanning a wide range of costs and efficiencies, it cannot be considered as an exhaustive statement of control options. Moreover, the choice of control measures and technologies for any particular case will depend on a number of factors, including current legislation and regulatory provisions and, in particular, control technology requirements, primary energy patterns, industrial infrastructure, economic circumstances and specific in-plant conditions.  

### 5  

The annex mainly addresses the control of oxidized sulphur emissions considered as the sum of sulphur dioxide (SO <sub>2</sub>) and sulphur trioxide (SO <sub>3</sub>), expressed as SO <sub>2</sub>. The share of sulphur emitted as either sulphur oxides or other sulphur compounds from non-combustion processes and other sources is small compared to sulphur emissions from combustion.  

### 6  

When measures or technologies are planned for sulphur sources emitting other components, in particular nitrogen oxides, (NO <sub>x</sub>), particulates, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), it is worthwile to consider them in conjunction with pollutant-specific control options in order to maximize the overall abatement effect and minimize the impact on the environment and, especially, to avoid the transfer of air pollution problems to other media (such as waste water and solid waste).  

### II  

####MAJOR STATIONARY SOURCES FOR SULPHUR EMISSIONS

### 7  

Fossil fuel combustion processes are the main source of anthropogenic sulphur emissions from stationary sources. In addition, some non-combustion processes may contribute considerably to the emissions. The major stationary source categories, based on EMEP/CORINAIR'90, include: 

i) Public power, cogeneration and district heating plants: 

a) Boilers;  

b) Stationary combustion turbines and internal combustion engines;    

ii) Commercial, institutional and residential combustion plants: 

a) Commercial boilers;  

b) Domestic heaters;    

iii) Industrial combustion plants and processes with combustion: 

a) Boilers and process heaters;  

b) Processes, e.g. metallurgical operations such as roasting and sintering, coke oven plants, processing of titanium dioxide (TiO <sub>2</sub>), etc);  

c) Pulp production;    

iv) Non-combustion processes, e.g. sulphuric acid production, specific organic synthesis processes, treatment of metallic surfaces;  

v) Extraction, processing and distribution of fossil fuels;  

vi) Waste treatment and disposal, e.g. thermal treatment of municipal and industrial waste.    

### 8  

Overall data (1990) for the ECE region indicate that about 88% of total sulphur emissions originate from all combustion processes (20% from industrial combustion), 5% from production processes and 7% from oil refineries. The power plant sector in many countries is the major single contributor to sulphur emissions. In some countries, the industrial sector (including refineries) is also an important SO <sub>2</sub> emitter. Although emissions from refineries in the ECE region are relatively small, their impact on sulphur emissions from other sources is large due to the sulphur in the oil products. Typically 60% of the sulphur intake present in the crudes remains in the products, 30% is recovered as elemental sulphur and 10% is emitted from refinery stacks.  

### III  

####GENERAL OPTIONS FOR REDUCTION OF SULPHUR EMISSIONS FROM COMBUSTION

### 9  

General options for reduction of sulphur emissions are: 

i) Energy management measures: <sup> *)  Options (i) (a) and (b) are integrated in the energy structure and policy of a Party. Implementation status, efficiency and costs per sector are not considered here.  </sup> 

a) Energy saving The rational use of energy (improved energy efficiency/process operation, cogeneration and/or demand-side management) usually results in a reduction in sulphur emissions.  

b) Energy mix In general, sulphur emissions can be reduced by increasing the proportion of non-combustion energy sources (i.e. hydro, nuclear, wind, etc) to the energy mix. However, further environmental impacts to be considered.    

ii) Technological options: 

a) Fuel switching The SO <sub>2</sub> emissions during combustion are directly related to the sulphur content of the fuel used. Fuel switching (e.g. from high- to low-sulphur coals and/or liquid fuels, or from coal to gas) leads to lower sulphur emissions, but there may be certain restrictions, such as the availability of low-sulphur fuels and the adaptability of existing combustion systems to different fuels. In many ECE countries, some coal or oil combustion plants are being replaced by gas-fired combustion plants. Dual-fuel plants may facilitate fuel switching.  

b) Fuel cleaning Cleaning of natural gas is state-of-the-art technology and widely applied for operational reasons. Cleaning of process gas (acid refinery gas, coke oven gas, biogas, etc.) is alo state-of-the-art technology. Desulphurization of liquid fuels (light and middle fractions) is state-of-the-art technology. Desulphurization of heavy fractions is technically feasible; nevertheless, the crude properties should be kept in mind. Desulphurization of atmospheric residue (bottom products from atmospheric crude distillation units) for the production of low-sulphur fuel oil is not, however, commonly practised; processing low-sulphur crude is usually preferable. Hydro-cracking and full conversion technology have matured and combine high sulphur retention with improved yield of light products. The number of full conversion refineries is as yet limited. Such refineries typically recover 80 to 90% of the sulphur intake and convert all residues into light products or other marketable products. For this type of refinery, energy consumption and investment costs are increased. Typical sulphur content for refinery products is given in table 1 below.  Table 1 Sulphur content from refinery products (S content (%)) 

|
|
| --- | Typical present values  | Anticipated future values  |
| Gasoline  | 0.1  | 0.05  |
| Jet kerosene  | 0.1  | 0.01  |
| Diesel  | 0.05 - 0.3  | < 0.05  |
| Heating oil  | 0.1 - 0.2  | < 0.1  |
| Fuel oil  | 0.2 - 3.5  | < 1  |
| Marine Diesel  | 0.5 - 1.0  | < 0.5  |
| Bunker oil  | 3.0 - 5.0  | < 1 (coastal areas)  < 2 (high seas)  |

Current technologies to clean hard coal can remove approximately 50% of the inorganic sulphur (depending on coal properties) but none of the organic sulphur. More effective technologies are being developed which, however, involve higher specific investment and costs. Thus the efficiency of sulphur removal by coal cleaning is limited compared to flue gas desulphurization. There may be a country-specific optimization potential for the best combination of fuel cleaning and flue gas cleaning.  

c) Advanced combustion technologies These combustion technologies with improved thermal efficiency and reduced sulphur emissions include: fluidized-bed combustion (FBC): bubbling (BFBC), circulating (CFBC) and pressurized (PFBC); integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC); and combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) Stationary combustion turbines can be integrated into combustion systems in existing conventional power plants which can increase overall efficiency by 5 to 7 % leading, for example, to a significant reduction in SO <sub>2</sub> -emissions. However, major alternations to the existing furnace system become necessary. Fluidized-bed combustion is a combustion technology for burning hard coal and brown coal, but it can also burn other solid fuels such as petroleum coke and low-grade fuels such as waste, peat and wood. Emissions can additionally be reduced by integrated combustion control in the system due to the addition of lime/limestone to the bed material. The total installed capacity of FBC has reached approximately 30.000 MW <sub>th</sub> (250 to 350 plants), incuding 8,000 MW <sub>th</sub> in the capacity range of greater than 50 MW <sub>th</sub>. By-products from this process may cause problems with respect to use and/or disposal, and further development is required. The IGCC process includes coal gasification and combined-cycle power generation in a gas and steam turbine. The gasified coal is burnt in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine. Sulphur emission control is achieved by the use of state-of-the-art technology for raw gas cleaningfacilities upstream of the gas turbine. The technology also exists for heavy oil residues and bitumen emulsions. The installed capacity is presently about 1,000 MW <sub>el</sub> (5 plants). Combined-cycle gas-turbine power stations using natural gas as fuel with an energy efficiency of approximately 48 to 52% are currently being planned.  

d) Process and combustion modifications Combustion modifications comparable to the measures used for NO <sub>x</sub> emission control do not exist, as during combustion the organically and/or inorganically bound sulphur is almost completely oxidized (a certain percentage depending on the fuel properties and combustion technology is retained in the ash). In this annex dry additive processes for conventional boilers are considered as process modifications due to the injection of an agent into the combustion unit. However, experience has shown that, when applying these processes, thermal capacity is lowered, the Ca/S ratio is high and sulphur removal low. Problems with the further utilization of the by-product have to be considered, so that this solution should usually be applied as an intermediate measure and for smaller units (table 2).  Table 2 Emissions of sulphur oxides obtained from the application of technological options to fossil-fuelled boilers

<sup>a)</sup> For high sulphur content in the fuel the removal efficiency has to be adapted. However, the scope for doing so may be process-specific. Availability of these processes is usually 95%.  

<sup>b)</sup> Limited applicability for high-sulphur fuels.  

<sup>c)</sup> Emission in mg/m <sup>3</sup> (STP), dry, 6% oxygen for solid fuels, 3% oxygen for liquid fuels.  

<sup>d)</sup> Conversion factor depends on fuel properties, specific fuel gas volume and thermal efficiency of boiler (conversion factors (m <sup>3</sup> kWh <sub>el</sub>, thermal efficiency: 36%) used: hard coal: 3.50; brown coal: 4.20; heavy oil: 2.80).  

<sup>e)</sup> Specific investment cost relates to a small sample of installations.  

<sup>f)</sup> Specific investment cost includes denitrification process.   The table was established mainly for large combustion installations in the public sector. However, the control options are also valid for other sectors with similar exhaust gases.  

e) Flue gas desulphurization (FGD) processes These processes aim at removing already formed sulphur oxides, and are also referred to as secondary measures. The state-of-the-art technologies for flue gas treatment processes are all based on the removal of sulphur by wet, dry or semi-dry and catalytic chemical processes.   To achieve the most efficient programme for sulphur emission reductions beyond the energy management measures listed in (i) above a combination of technological options identified in (ii) above should be considered. In some cases options for reducing sulphur emissions may also result in the reduction of emissions of CO <sub>2</sub>, NO <sub>x</sub> and other pollutants. In public power, cogeneration and district heating plants, flue gas treatment processes used include: lime/limestone wet scrubbing (LWS); spray dry absorption (SDA); Wellman Lord process (WL); ammonia scrubbing (AS); and combined NO <sub>X</sub> /SO <sub>X</sub> removal processes (activated carbon process (AC) and combined catalytic NO <sub>x</sub> /SO <sub>x</sub> removal). In the power generation sector, LWS and SDA cover 85% and 10% respectively, of the installed FGD capacity. Several new flue gas desulphurization processes, such as electron beam dry scrubbing (EBDS) and Mark 13A, have not yet passed the pilot stage. Table 2 above shows the efficiency of the above-mentioned secondary measures based on the practical experience gathered from a large number of implemented plants. The implemented capacity as well as the capacity range are also mentioned. Despite comparable characteristics for several sulphur abatement technologies, local or plant-specific influences may lead to the exclusion of a given technology. Table 2 also includes the usual investment cost ranges for the sulphur abatement technologies listed in sections (ii) (c), (d) and (e). However, when applying these technologies to individual cases it should be noted that investment costs of emission reduction measures will depend amongst other things on the particular technologies used, the required control systems, the plant size, the extent of the required reduction and the time-scale of planned maintenance cycles. The table thus gives only a broad range of investment costs. Investment costs for retrofit generally exceed those for new plants.    

### IV  

####CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR OTHER SECTORS

### 10  

The control techniques listed in section 9 (ii) (a) to (e) are valid not only in the power plant sector but also in various other sectors of industry. Several years of operational experience have been acquired, in most cases in the power plant sector.  

### 11  

The application of sulphur abatement technologies in the industrial sector merely depends on the process's specific limitations in the relevant sectors. Important contributors to sulphur emissions and corresponding reduction measures are presented in table 3 below.  Table 3 

|
|
| Source  | Reduction measures  |
| Roasting of non-ferrous sulphides  Viscose production  | Wet sulphuric acid catalytic process (WSA)  Double-contact process  |
| Sulphuric acid production  | Double-contact-process, improved yield  |
| Kraft pulp production  | Variety of process-integrated measures  |

### 12  

In the sectors listed in table 3, process-integrated measures, including raw material changes (if necessary combined with sector-specific flue gas treatment), can be used to achieve the most effective reduction of sulphur emissions.  

### 13  

Reported examples are the following: 

a) In new kraft pulp mills, sulphur emission of less than 1 kg of sulphur per tonne of pulp AD (air dried) can be achieved; <sup> *)  Control of sulphur-to-sodium ratio is required, i.e. removal of sulphur in the form of neutral salts and use of sulphur-free sodium make-up.  </sup>  

b) In sulphite pulp mills, 1 to 1.5 kg of sulphur per tonne of pulp AD can be achieved;  

c) In the case of roasting of sulphides, removal efficiencies of 80 to 99% for 10,000 to 200,000 m <sup>3</sup> /h units have been reported (depending on the process);  

d) For one iron or sintering plant, an FGD unit of 320,000 m <sup>3</sup> /h capacity achieves a clean gas value below 100 mg SO <sub>x</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> at 6% 0 <sub>2</sub>;  

e) Coke ovens are achieving less than 400 mg SO <sub>x</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> at 6% 0 <sub>2</sub>;  

f) Sulphuric acid plants achieve a conversion rate larger than 99%;  

g) Advanced Claus plant achieves sulphur recovery of more than 99%.    

### V  

####BY-PRODUCTS AND SIDE-EFFECTS

### 14  

As efforts to reduce sulphur emissions from stationary sources are increased in the countries of the ECE region, the quantities of by-products will also increase.  

### 15  

Options which would lead to usable by-products should be selected. Furthermore, options that lead to increased thermal efficiency and minimize the waste disposal issue whenever possible should be selected. Although most by-products are usable or recyclable products such as gypsum, ammonia salts, sulphuric acid or sulphur, factors such as market conditions and quality standards need to be taken into account. Further utilization of FBC and SDA by-products have to be improved and investigated, as disposal sites and disposal criteria limit disposal in several countries.  

### 16  

The following side-effects will not prevent the implementation of any technology or method but should be considered when several sulphur abatement options are possible: 

a) Eenergy requirements of the gas treatment processes;  

b) Corrosion attack due to the formation of sulphuric acid by the reaction of sulphur oxides with water vapour;  

c) Increased use of water and waste water treatment;  

d) Reagent requirements;  

e) Solid waste disposal.    

### VI  

####MONITORING AND REPORTING

### 17  

The measures taken to carry out national strategies and policies for the abatement of air pollution include: legislation and regulatory provisions, economic incentives and disincentives; as well as technological requirements (best available technology).  

### 18  

In general, standards are set, per emission source, according to plant size, operating mode, combustion technology, fuel type and whether it is a new or existing plant. An alternative approach also used is to set a target for the reduction of total sulphur emissions from a group of sources and to allow a choice of where to take action to reach this target (the bubble concept).  

### 19  

Efforts to limit the sulphur emissions to the levels set out in the national framework legislation have to be controlled by a permanent monitoring and reporting system and reported to the supervising authorities.  

### 20  

Several monitoring systems, using both continuous and discontinuous measurement methods, are available. However, quality requirements vary. Measurements are to be carried out by qualified institutes using measuring and monitoring systems. To this end, a certification system can provide the best assurance.  

### 21  

In the framework of modern automated monitoring systems and process control equipment, reporting does not create a problem. The collection of data for further use is a state-of-the-art technique, however, data to be reported to competent authorities differ from case to case. To obtain better comparability, data sets and prescribing regulations should be harmonized. Harmonization is also desirable for quality assurance of measuring and monitoring systems. This should be taken into account when comparing data.  

### 22  

To avoid discrepancies and inconsistencies, key issues and parameters, including the following, must be well defined: 

a) Definition of standards expressed as ppmv, mg/Nm <sup>3</sup>, g/GJ, kg/h or kg/tonne of product. Most of these units need to be calculated and need specification in terms of gas temperature, humidity, pressure, oxygen content or heat input value;  

b) Definition of the period over which standards are to be averaged, expressed as hours, months or a year;  

c) Definition of failure times and corresponding emergency regulations regarding bypass of monitoring systems or shut-down of the installation;  

d) Definition of methods for back-filling of data missed or lost as a result of equipment failure;  

e) Definition of the parameter set to be measured. Depending on the type of industrial process, the necessary information may differ. This also involves the location of the measurement point within the system.    

### 23  

Quality control of measurements has to be ensured.

<sup>a)</sup> As guidance, for a plant with a multi-fuel firing unit involving the simultaneous use of two or more types of fuels, the competent authorities shall set emission limit values taking into account the emission limit values from column (ii) relevant for each individual fuel the rate of thermal input delivered by each fuel and, for refineries, the relevant specific characteristics of the plant. For refineries, such a combined limit value shall under no circumstances exceed 1700 mg SO <sub>2</sub> /NM <sup>3</sup>. In particular, the limit values shall not apply to the following plants: 

- Plants in which the products of combustion are used for direct heating, drying, or any other treatment of objects or materials, e.g. reheating furnaces, furnaces for heat treatment;  

- Post-combustion plants, i.e. any technical apparatus designed to purify the waste gases by combustion which is not operated as an independent combustion plant;  

- Facilities for the regeneration of catalytic cracking catalysts;  

- Facilities for the conversion of hydrogen sulphide into sulphur;  

- Reactors used in the chemical industry;  

- Coke battery furnaces;  

- Cowpers;  

- Waste incinerators;  

- Plants powered by diesel, petrol and gas engines or by gas turbines, irrespective of the fuel used.   In a case where a Party, due to the high sulphur content of indigenous solid or liquid fuels, cannot meet the emission limit values set forth in column (ii), it may apply the desulphurization rates set forth in column (iii) or a maximum limit value of 800 mg S0 <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> (although preferably not more than 650 mg SO <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup>. The Party shall report any such application to the Implementation Committee in the calendar year n which it is made. Where two or more separate new plants are installed in such a way that, taking technical and economic factors into account, their waste gases could, in the judgement of the competent authorities, be discharged through a common stack, the combination formed by such plants is to be regarded as a single unit.

### Bijlage  IV  

####Technologieën voor beheersing van zwavelemissies uit stationaire bronnen

### I  

####INLEIDING

1.  Deze bijlage heeft tot doel een richtsnoer te geven bij de vaststelling van de keuzen en technologieën voor de beheersing van zwavel ter nakoming van de verplichtingen van het huidige Protocol.   
2.  De bijlage is gebaseerd op de informatie over algemene keuzemogelijkheden voor de vermindering van zwavelemissies en met name over de resultaten en de kosten van de technologie voor emissiebeheersing die is opgenomen in de officiële documentatie van het Uitvoerend Orgaan en de daaraan ondergeschikte lichamen.   
3.  Tenzij anders aangegeven worden de opgesomde verminderingsmaatregelen, op basis van een in de meeste gevallen jarenlange praktijkervaring, geacht de best beschikbare technologieën te zijn die het meest gangbaar zijn en economisch het meest verantwoord zijn. Gezien het feit dat steeds meer ervaring wordt opgedaan met de toepassing van tot een lage emissie leidende maatregelen en technologieën in nieuwe installaties, alsook met de aanpassing van bestaande installaties, zal deze bijlage echter regelmatig moeten worden herzien.   
4.  Hoewel in de bijlage een aantal, qua kosten en doeltreffendheid sterk uiteenlopende, maatregelen en technologieën is opgenomen, mag zij echter niet als een uitputtende opsomming van de beschikbare beheersingsmogelijkheden worden beschouwd. Bovendien hangt de keuze van beheersingsmaatregelen en -technologieën voor elk bijzonder geval af van een aantal factoren, waaronder de geldende wet- en regelgeving, en, in het bijzonder, de aan de beheersingstechnologie gestelde eisen, de structuur van de primaire-energievoorziening, de industriële infrastructuur, de economische omstandigheden en de specifieke situatie in de betrokken installatie.   
5.  De bijlage heeft hoofdzakelijk betrekking op de beheersing van de emissies van zwaveloxiden, namelijk zwaveloxide (SO <sub>2</sub>) en zwaveltrioxide (SO <sub>3</sub>), dit laatste uitgedrukt als SO <sub>2</sub>. Het aandeel van zwavel uitgestoten als zwaveloxiden, of andere zwavelverbindingen vanuit processen waarbij geen verbranding optreedt, en vanuit andere bronnen, is klein vergeleken met zwavelemissies vanuit verbranding.   
6.  Wanneer maatregelen of technologieën worden gepland voor zwavelbronnen die ook andere stoffen uitstoten, met name stikstofoxiden (NO <sub>X</sub>), deeltjes, zware metalen en vluchtige organische stoffen (VOS), verdient het aanbeveling deze in samenhang met op specifieke verontreinigende stoffen gerichte beheersingsmethoden te beschouwen teneinde het totale bestrijdingseffect te maximaliseren en de inwerking op het milieu tot een minimum te beperken, en met name de verplaatsing van luchtverontreinigingsproblemen naar andere media (zoals afvalwater en vast afval) te voorkomen.   

### II  

####BELANGRIJKE STATIONAIRE BRONNEN VAN ZWAVELEMISSIES

7.  Verbranding van fossiele brandstoffen is de belangrijkste bron van antropogene zwavelemissies uit stationaire bronnen. Daarnaast kunnen enkele processen waarbij geen verbranding optreedt, aanzienlijk tot de emissies bijdragen. De belangrijkste categorieën stationaire bronnen, op basis van EMEP/CORINAIR’90, omvatten: 

i) Openbare elektriciteitscentrales, warmte/krachtkoppeling en stads/blokverwarming: 

a. stoomketels;  

b. stationaire verbrandingsturbines en inwendige-verbrandingsmotoren;    

ii) Verbrandingsinstallaties ten behoeve van winkel-, kantoor- en woonruimten: 

a. bedrijfsketels;  

b. verwarmingsinstallaties in woningen;    

iii) Industriële verbrandingsinstallaties en processen waarbij verbranding optreedt: 

a. stoomketels en procesfornuizen;  

b. processen, b.v. metallurgische bewerkingen zoals roosten en sinteren, cokesovens, verwerking van titaandioxide (TiO <sub>2</sub>), enz;  

c. pulpproduktie;    

iv) Processen waarbij geen verbranding optreedt, b.v. produktie van zwavelzuur, specifieke organische syntheseprocessen, behandeling van metalen oppervlakken;  

v) Winning, be/verwerking en distributie van fossiele brandstoffen;  

vi) Afvalbehandeling en -verwijdering, b.v. thermische behandeling van stedelijk en industrieel afval.     
8.  Uit de gegevens (1990) voor het ECE-gebied als geheel blijkt dat circa 88% van de totale zwavelemissies afkomstig is van de diverse verbrandingsprocessen (20% van industriële verbrandingsprocessen), 5% van produktieprocessen en 7% van olieraffinaderijen. De elektriciteitsproduktie is in veel landen de belangrijkste afzonderlijke veroorzaker van zwavelemissies. In sommige landen draagt de industriële sector (inclusief raffinaderijen) eveneens in sterke mate bij aan de SO <sub>2</sub> -uitstoot. Hoewel de emissies van raffinaderijen in het ECE-gebied betrekkelijk gering zijn, hebben zij een grote invloed op de zwavelemissies uit andere bronnen door de in de olieprodukten aanwezige zwavel. Normaal blijft 60% van de hoeveelheid zwavel in de ruwe olie achter in de geraffineerde produkten, wordt 60% teruggewonnen als zuivere zwavel en ontsnapt 10% via de schoorsteen.   

### III  

####ALGEMENE MOGELIJKHEDEN VOOR VERMINDERING VAN DE DOOR VERBRANDING VEROORZAAKTE ZWAVELEMISSIES

9.  Algemene mogelijkheden voor vermindering van de zwavelemissies zijn: 

i) Maatregelen voor energiebeheer: <sup> *)  De mogelijkheden (i) (a) en (b) zijn verwerkt in de energiestructuur en het energiebeleid van een Partij. Uitvoeringsstadium, efficiëntie en kosten per sector worden hier niet in beschouwing genomen.  </sup> 

a. energiebesparing Rationeel energiegebruik (verbeterde energie-efficiëntie/procesbesturing, warmte/krachtkoppeling en/of beheersing van de vraag) leidt gewoonlijk tot lagere zwavelemissies.  

b. samenstelling van het energiepakket In het algemeen kunnen zwavelemissies worden verminderd door het aandeel van niet door verbranding vrijkomende vormen van energie (waterkracht, kernenergie, windenergie, enz.) in het energiepakket te verhogen. Daarbij moet wel met bijkomende milieu-effecten rekening worden gehouden.    

ii) Technologische maatregelen: 

a. overschakeling op andere brandstoffen De omvang van de SO <sub>2</sub> -emissies bij verbranding houdt rechtstreeks verband met het zwavelgehalte van de gebruikte brandstof. Overschakeling op een andere brandstof (b.v. van steenkool met een hoog op steenkool met een laag zwavelgehalte en/of op vloeibare brandstoffen, of van steenkool op gas) leidt tot lagere zwavelemissies, maar er kunnen bepaalde beperkende factoren optreden, zoals de beschikbaarheid van brandstoffen met een laag zwavelgehalte en de mate waarin bestaande verbrandingsinstallaties aan andere brandstoffen kunnen worden aangepast. In veel ECE-landen wordt een aantal op kolen of olie werkende verbrandingsinstallaties vervangen door gasgestookte installaties. Zogenaamde „dual fuel” installaties kunnen overschakeling op andere brandstoffen vergemakkelijken.  

b. reiniging van brandstof Reiniging van aardgas is een geavanceerde technologie en wordt om operationele redenen op grote schaal toegepast. Reiniging van procesgas (zuur raffinaderijgas, cokesovengas, biogas, enz.) is eveneens een geavanceerde technologie. Ook de ontzwaveling van vloeibare brandstoffen (lichte en middelzware fracties) is een technologisch geavanceerd proces. Ontzwaveling van zware fracties is technisch uitvoerbaar; wel moet rekening worden gehouden met de eigenschappen van de betrokken ruwe olie. Ontzwaveling van het atmosferisch residu (bodemprodukten van bij atmosferische druk werkende destillatie-eenheden voor ruwe olie) met het oog op de produkie van stookolie met een laag zwavelgehalte wordt echter niet algemeen toegepast; verwerking van laagzwavelige ruwe olie verdient gewoonlijk de voorkeur. Hydrogenerend kraken en volledige conversie hebben zich tot volwaardige technologieën ontwikkeld; zij combineren een hoge zwavelonttrekking met een verbeterde opbrengst aan lichte produkten. Het aantal raffinaderijen waar volledige conversie plaatsvindt is nog beperkt. Karakteristiek voor dit type raffinaderijen is dat 80 à 90% van de in de ruwe olie aanwezige zwavel wordt teruggewonnen en dat alle residuen omgezet worden in lichte produkten of andere verhandelbare produkten. Het energieverbruik en de investeringskosten zijn bij dergelijke raffinaderijen echter wel hoger. In tabel 1 hierna volgend is het typische zwavelgehalte van raffinageprodukten aangegeven.  Tabel 1 Zwavelgehalte van raffinageprodukten (S-gehalte in %) 

| --- | --- | --- |
|---|---|---|
| --- | Typische huidige waarden  | Verwachte waarden voor waarden de toekomst  |
| Benzine  | 0,1  | 0,05  |
| Kerosine voor straalmotoren  | 0,1  | 0,01  |
| Dieselolie  | 0,05 - 0,3  | < 0,05  |
| Huisbrandolie  | 0,1 - 0,2  | < 0,1  |
| Stookolie  | 0,2 - 3,5  | < 1  |
| Scheepsdieselolie  | 0,5 - 1,0  | < 0,5  |
| Bunkerolie  | 3,0 - 5,0  | < 1 (kustgebieden)  < 2 (volle zee)  |

Met de bestaande technologieën voor het zuiveren van steenkool kan anorganische zwavel voor circa 50% (afhankelijk van de eigenschappen van de steenkool), maar organische zwavel in het geheel niet worden verwijderd. Er worden thans doeltreffender technologieën ontwikkeld, maar deze vergen hogere investeringen en kosten. Daardoor is het rendement van ontzwaveling door reiniging van de steenkool lager dan dat van rookgasontzwaveling. Het is mogelijk dat er specifiek voor een land een optimalisatiepotentieel bestaat voor de beste combinatie van brandstofreiniging en rookgasontzwaveling.  

c. geavanceerde verbrandingstechnologieën Verbrandingstechnologieën met verbeterd thermisch rendement en verlaagde zwavelemissies omvatten: wervelbedverbranding (FBC); vastbed (BFBC), circulerend bed (CFBC) en wervelbed onder druk (PFBC); kolenvergassing/stoom- en gasturbine (KV-STEG) (IGCC); gecombineerde stoomcyclus en gasturbines (CCGT). Stationaire verbrandingsturbines kunnen worden geïntegreerd in verbrandingssystemen in bestaande conventionele elektriciteitscentrales, waardoor het totale rendement met 5 à 7% kan worden opgevoerd, met onder andere een aanzienlijke verlaging van de SO <sub>2</sub> -uitstoot tot gevolg. Ingrijpende aanpassingen aan het bestaande ketelsysteem zijn evenwel niet noodzakelijk. Wervelbedverbranding is een techniek voor het verbranden van steenkool en bruinkool, maar is ook bruikbaar voor andere vaste brandstoffen zoals petroleumcokes en laagwaardige brandstoffen zoals afval, turf en hout. De emissies kunnen verder worden verlaagd door middel van geïntegreerde verbrandingsregeling in het systeem door toevoeging van kalk/kalksteen aan het bedmateriaal. De totale geïnstalleerde FBC-capaciteit bedraagt thans circa 30 000 MW <sub>th</sub> (250 à 350 installaties), waarvan 8 000 MW <sub>th</sub> in de klasse installaties met een capaciteit van meer dan 50 MW <sub>th</sub>. Het gebruik en/of de verwijdering van de bij dit proces gevormde bijprodukten kan problemen opleveren, en verdere ontwikkeling is vereist. Het IGCC-proces omvat kolenvergassing en elektriciteitsopwekking in een gecombineerde cyclus in een gas- en stoomturbine. De vergaste kool wordt verbrand in de verbrandingskamer van de gasturbine. Beheersing van de zwavelemissies wordt gerealiseerd door reiniging van het ruwe gas vóór de gasturbine met gebruikmaking van geavanceerde technologie. Deze technologie bestaat ook voor zware olieresiduen en bitumenemulsies. De geïnstalleerde capaciteit bedraagt thans circa 1 000 MW <sub>th</sub> (5 installaties). Aardgasgestookte elektriciteitscentrales met gecombineerde stoom-/gasturbinecyclus die een energie-efficiëntie van ca. 48 à 52% realiseren zijn thans in het ontwerpstadium.  

d. wijzigingen in processen en verbranding Van wijzigingen in de verbranding die vergelijkbaar zijn met de maatregelen die met het oog op NO <sub>x</sub> -emissiebeheersing worden toegepast is geen sprake, aangezien tijdens de verbranding vrijwel alle organisch en/of anorganisch gebonden zwavel oxydeert (een bepaald percentage, dat afhankelijk is van de eigenschappen van de brandstof en de toegepaste verbrandingstechnologie, blijft achter in de as). In deze bijlage worden de bij conventionele ketels toegepaste processen met behulp van droge additieven beschouwd als proceswijzigingen, aangezien een actieve stof in de verbrandingseenheid wordt gebracht. Uit ervaring is echter gebleken dat bij toepassing van deze processen de thermische capaciteit daalt, de Ca/S-verhouding hoog is en weinig zwavel wordt onttrokken. Ook moet rekening worden gehouden met problemen bij het verdere gebruik van de bijprodukten, zodat deze oplossing doorgaans slechts als een tijdelijke maatregel bruikbaar is, en alleen voor kleinere eenheden (tabel 2).

<sup>a)</sup> Voor brandstof met een hoog zwavelgehalte moet het ontzwavelingsrendement worden aangepast. De mogelijkheden hiertoe kunnen variëren naar gelang van het proces. De beschikbaarheid van deze processen bedraagt gewoonlijk 95%.  

<sup>b)</sup> Beperkte toepasbaarheid voor brandstoffen met een hoog zwavelgehalte.  

<sup>c)</sup> Emissie in mg/m <sup>3</sup> (STP), droog, 6% zuurstof voor vaste brandstoffen, 3% zuurstof voor vloeibare brandstoffen.  

<sup>d)</sup> De conversiefactor is afhankelijk van de eigenschappen van de brandstof, het specifieke volume van het rookgas en het thermische rendement van die ketel (gebruikte conversielagen m <sup>3</sup> /KW <sub>h</sub>, thermisch rendement: 36%; steenkool: 3,50; bruinkool: 4,20; zware stookolie: 2,80).  

<sup>e)</sup> De vermelde specifieke investeringskosten hebben betrekking op een kleine steekproef van installaties.  

<sup>f)</sup> De vermelde specifieke investeringskosten omvatten ook voorzieningen voor het verwijderen van stikstofoxiden.   Deze tabel is hoofdzakelijk opgesteld ten behoeve van grote stookinstallaties in de openbare sector. De beheersingsmethoden zijn echter ook geldig voor andere sectoren met vergelijkbare rookgassen.  

e. processen voor rookgasontwikkeling (FGD) Met deze processen wordt beoogd reeds gevormde zwaveloxiden te verwijderen; zij worden ook als secundaire maatregelen aangeduid. De geavanceerde technologieën voor rookgasbehandeling zijn alle gebaseerd op de verwijdering van zwavel door middel van natte, droge of semi-droge en katalytische chemische processen. Om een zo efficiënt mogelijk programma voor vermindering van de zwavelemissies te ontwikkelen naast de onder (i) vermelde maatregelen voor energiebeheer moet een combinatie van onder (ii) aangegeven technologische maatregelen worden overwogen. In sommige gevallen kunnen methodes voor vermindering van de zwavelemissies ook leiden tot een vermindering van de emissies van C0 <sub>2</sub>, NO <sub>x</sub> en andere verontreinigende stoffen. De in elektriciteitscentrales, warmte/kracht- en stadsverwarmingsinstallaties toegepaste processen voor rookgasbehandeling omvatten: natte reiniging met kalk/kalksteen (LWS), het sproeidroogproces (SDA), het Wellman Lord-proces (WL), reiniging met ammoniak (AS) en processen voor de gecombineerde verwijdering van NO <sub>x</sub> /SO <sub>x</sub> (gebruik van geactiveerde kool (AC) en gecombineerde katalytische verwijdering van NO <sub>x</sub> /SO <sub>x</sub>). In de sector elektriciteitsopwekking bestaat de geïnstalleerde FGD-capaciteit voor 85% resp. 10% uit LWS- en SDA-voorzieningen. Verschillende nieuwe rookgasontzwavelingsprocessen, zoals droge reiniging met een elektronenbundel (EBDS) en Mark 13A, bevinden zich nog in het proefstadium. In tabel 2 wordt het rendement van bovenvermelde secundaire maatregelen aangegeven op basis van de met een groot aantal installaties opgedane ervaring De geïnstalleerde capaciteit en het capaciteitsbereik worden eveneens vermeld. Door lokale of met de betrokken installatie samenhangende factoren kan het voorkomen dat van verschillende technologieën voor vermindering van de zwaveluitstoot met vergelijkbare kenmerken een bepaalde technologie in een gegeven geval niet bruikbaar is. Tabel 2 vermeldt tevens de marge waarbinnen de investeringskosten voor de onder (ii), c), d) en e), genoemde technologieën zich gewoonlijk bewegen. Bij de toepassing van deze technologieën in individuele gevallen dient er evenwel rekening mee te worden gehouden, dat de met maatregelen voor emissievermindering samenhangende investeringskosten onder andere worden bepaald door de specifieke technologieën die worden toegepast, de benodigde beheersingssystemen, de omvang van de installatie, de mate waarin de zwaveluitstoot moet worden verminderd en het tijdschema voor de geplande onderhoudscycli. De tabel geeft dus alleen een algemene indicatie van de investeringskosten. De investeringskosten voor de aanpassing van bestaande installaties overtreffen doorgaans die voor nieuwe installaties.       

### IV  

####BEHEERSINGSTECHNIEKEN VOOR ANDERE SECTOREN

10.  De in punt 9. (ii), a) t/m e), vermelde beheersingstechnieken zijn niet alleen geschikt voor de sector elektriciteitsopwekking, maar ook voor diverse andere sectoren van de industrie. Er is reeds gedurende verschillende jaren praktijkervaring mee opgedaan, in de meeste gevallen in elektriciteitscentrales.   
11.  De keuze van technologieën ter vermindering van zwavelemissies in de industrie wordt uitsluitend bepaald door de specifieke beperkingen van de in de betrokken sectoren toegepaste processen. In tabel 3 hieronder wordt een overzicht gegeven van een aantal belangrijke bronnen van zwavelemissies en de ter bestrijding daarvan genomen maatregelen.  Tabel 3 

|
|
| Bron  | Maatregel  |
| Roosten van non-ferrosulfiden  | Het katalytisch procédé waarbij zwavelzuur wordt gevormd (WSA)  |
| Viscoseproduktie  | Dubbel-contactprocédé  |
| Zwavelzuurproduktie  | Dubbel-contactprocédé, verbeterd rendement  |
| Kraftpulpproduktie  | Diverse in het proces geïntegreerde maatregelen  |

12.  In de in tabel 3 vermelde sectoren kan gebruik worden gemaakt van in het proces geïntegreerde maatregelen, inclusief verandering van grondstof (indien nodig gecombineerd met een specifiek op de betrokken sector afgestemde rookgasbehandeling), om de zwavelemissies zo doeltreffend mogelijk terug te dringen.   
13.  Uit de praktijk kunnen de volgende voorbeelden worden gegeven: 

a. In nieuwe kraftpulpfabrieken is een emissie van minder dan 1 kg zwavel per ton aan de lucht gedroogde (AD - air dried) pulp haalbaar; <sup> *)  Beheersing van de verhouding zwavel/natrium is noodzakelijk, m.a.w. zwavel moet in de vorm van neutrale zouten worden verwijderd en er moet gebruik worden gemaakt van zwavelvrij natrium.  </sup>  

b. In sulfietpulpfabrieken kan een emissie van 1 tot 1,5 kg zwavel per ton pulp AD worden gerealiseerd;  

c. Bij het roosten van sulfiden zijn verwijderingsrendementen van 80 à 99% gemeld voor installaties met een capaciteit van 10 000 tot 200 000 m <sup>3</sup> /uur (afhankelijk van het procédé);  

d. Bij één bepaalde installatie voor het sinteren van ijzererts wordt met een FGD-installatie met een capaciteit van 320 000 m <sup>3</sup> /uur voor het gezuiverde gas een waarde van minder dan 100 mg SO <sub>x</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> bij 6% O <sub>2</sub> gehaald;  

e. In cokesovens wordt een waarde van minder dan 400 mg SO <sub>x</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> bij 6% O <sub>2</sub> gerealiseerd;  

f. Installaties voor de produktie van zwavelzuur halen een conversiewaarde van meer dan 99%;  

g. Bij geavanceerde Clausinstallaties wordt een ontzwavelingsrendement van meer dan 99% gehaald.     

### V  

####BIJPRODUKTEN EN NEVENEFFECTEN

14.  Naarmate in de landen binnen het ECE-gebied de inspanningen worden opgevoerd om de zwavelemissies uit stationaire bronnen te verminderen, zullen ook de hoeveelheden bijprodukten toenemen.   
15.  Er moet worden gekozen voor methodes waarbij bruikbare bijprodukten ontstaan, en zoveel mogelijk voor methodes die een verhoogd thermisch rendement opleveren en waardoor het afvalverwijderingsprobleem tot een minimum wordt teruggebracht. Hoewel de meeste bijprodukten bruikbare of recycleerbare produkten zijn zoals gips, ammoniumzouten, zwavelzuur en zwavel, dient rekening te worden gehouden met factoren zoals marktomstandigheden en kwaliteitsnormen. Het gebruik van FBC- en SDA-bijprodukten moet worden verbeterd en tevens moet onderzoek worden gedaan naar verdere gebruiksmogelijkheden, aangezien in verschillende landen de beschikbaarheid van stortplaatsen en de geldende verwijderingscriteria een beperkende factor vormen voor de verwijdering van deze produkten.   
16.  De volgende neveneffecten vormen weliswaar geen beletsel voor de toepassing van een bepaalde technologie of methode, maar moeten wel degelijk in de overweging worden betrokken wanneer uit verschillende mogelijkheden voor vermindering van de zwavelemissies kan worden gekozen: 

a. Het energiebeslag van de gasbehandelingsprocessen;  

b. Corrosie door de vorming van zwavelzuur als gevolg van de reactie van zwaveloxiden met waterdamp;  

c. Hoger waterverbruik en de noodzaak meer afvalwater te behandelen;  

d. De eisen inzake reagentia;  

e. Verwijdering van vast afval.     

### VI  

####MONITORING EN RAPPORTAGE

17.  De maatregelen die worden genomen ter uitvoering van nationale strategieën en beleidsplannen voor vermindering van de luchtverontreiniging omvatten: wet- en regelgeving, positieve en negatieve economische prikkels, alsook technologische eisen (beste beschikbare technologie).   
18.  In het algemeen worden per emissiebron normen vastgesteld, afhankelijk van de omvang van de installatie, de wijze waarop deze functioneert, de verbrandingstechnologie, het brandstoftype en het feit of het een nieuwe, dan wel een bestaande installatie betreft. Een alternatieve methode bestaat erin een doelstelling voor vermindering van de totale zwavelemissies van een groep bronnen aan te geven en de keuze van de daartoe te nemen maatregelen vrij te laten („bubble concept”).   
19.  Om toezicht te houden op de inspanningen die worden gedaan om de zwavelemissies tot de in het kader van nationale wetgeving vastgelegde niveaus te beperken, moet een systeem voor permanente monitoring en rapportage aan de toezichthoudende instanties worden opgezet.   
20.  Verschillende bewakingssystemen, waarbij zowel continue als incidentele metingen worden uitgevoerd, zijn beschikbaar. De kwaliteitseisen lopen echter uiteen. De metingen moeten worden uitgevoerd door gekwalificeerde instellingen met gebruikmaking van welomschreven meet- en monitoringsystemen. Hiertoe kan een stelsel van certificering de beste garantie bieden.   
21.  Bij moderne geautomatiseerde monitoringsystemen en procesbeheersingsapparatuur levert rapportage geen problemen op. Het verzamelen van gegevens heeft zich tot een geavanceerde techniek ontwikkeld; de aan de bevoegde instanties te melden gegevens verschillen echter per geval. Voor een betere vergelijkbaarheid moeten de gegevensreeksen en de desbetreffende regelgeving worden geharmoniseerd. Harmonisatie is ook wenselijk voor de kwaliteitsverzekering van meet- en monitoringsystemen. Bij het vergelijken van gegevens dient hiermee rekening te worden gehouden.   
22.  Om discrepanties en tegenstrijdigheden te voorkomen moet een aantal kernelementen en parameters, waaronder de volgende, duidelijk worden omschreven: 

a. Normwaarden uitgedrukt in ppmv, mg/Nm <sup>3</sup>, g/GJ, kg/uur of kg/ton produkt. De meeste van deze eenheden moeten worden berekend en worden gespecificeerd voor een bepaalde gastemperatuur, vochtigheidsgraad, druk, zuurstofgehalte of thermische belasting;  

b. De periode waarover de normen dienen te worden gemiddeld, uitgedrukt in uren, maanden of jaren;  

c. Storingsperioden en de bij storing geldende noodmaatregelen met betrekking tot het overbruggen van de monitoringsystemen of het stilleggen van de installatie;  

d. Methodes voor het achteraf bepalen van door een defect aan de apparatuur gemiste of verloren gegane gegevens;  

e. De te meten reeks parameters. De informatie die vereist is kan variëren afhankelijk van de aard van het industriële proces. Ook de locatie van het meetpunt binnen het systeem moet worden bepaald.     
23.  Er moet voor kwaliteitszorg van de metingen worden gezorgd.

<sup>a)</sup> Als richtsnoer stellen de bevoegde instanties voor een installatie met een voor verschillende brandstoffen geschikte verbrandingseenheid waarin tegelijk twee of meer brandstoftypen worden verstookt, emissiegrenswaarden vast rekening houdend met de voor elke afzonderlijke brandstof geldende emissiegrenswaarde als vermeld in kolom (ii), de met elke brandstof gerealiseerde warmtetoevoer en, voor raffinaderijen, de relevante specifieke kenmerken van de installatie. Voor raffinaderijen mag deze gecombineerde grenswaarde in geen geval hoger zijn dan 1700 mg SO <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup>. De grenswaarden gelden met name niet voor de volgende installaties: 

installaties waar de verbrandingsprodukten worden gebruikt voor rechtstreekse verwarming, drogen of enige andere behandeling van voorwerpen of materialen, b.v. herverhittingsovens en ovens voor warmtebehandeling;  

naverbrandingsinstallaties, d.w.z. alle technische apparatuur die ontworpen is om afgassen te zuiveren door verbranding en die niet als een zelfstandige verbrandingsinstallatie wordt gebruikt;  

installaties voor het regenereren van bij het katalytisch kraken gebruikte katalysatoren;  

installaties voor de omzetting van waterstofsulfide in zwavel;  

in de chemische industrie gebruikte reactors;  

cokesbatterijovens;  

windverhilters van hoogovens;  

vuilverbrandingsinstallaties  

door diesel-, benzine- en gasmotoren of gasturbines aangedreven installaties, ongeacht de gebruikte brandstof.   Wanneer een Partij, wegens het hoge zwavelgehalte van de inheemse vaste vloeibare brandstoffen, niet kan voldoen aan de in kolom (ii) vermelde emissiegrenswaarden, dan kan zij de in kolom (iii) aangegeven ontzwavelingspercentages of een grenswaarde van maximaal 800 mg S0 <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> (zij het bij voorkeur niet hoger dan 650 mg SO <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup>) aanhouden. De Partij meldt deze afwijkingen bij het Implementatiecomité in het kalenderjaar waarin zij worden toegepast. Wanneer twee of meer afzonderlijke nieuwe installaties op zodanige wijze worden gebouwd dat, rekening houdend met technische en economische factoren, de afgassen daarvan naar het oordeel van de bevoegde instantie via een gemeenschappelijke schoorsteen zouden kunnen worden afgevoerd, dan wordt de door die installaties gevormde combinatie beschouwd als een enkele eenheid.  

<sup>b)</sup> Met mg SO <sub>2</sub> /Nm <sup>3</sup> wordt bedoeld de bij een temperatuur van 273° K en een druk van 101,3 kPa gemeten waarde, gecorrigeerd voor het gehalte aan waterdamp.
