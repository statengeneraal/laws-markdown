##Protocol bij het Verdrag van 1979 betreffende grensoverschrijdende luchtverontreiniging over lange afstand, inzake zware metalen

####Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals

The Parties, Determined to implement the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, Concerned that emissions of certain heavy metals are transported across national boundaries and may cause damage to ecosystems of environmental and economic importance and may have harmful effects on human health, Considering that combustion and industrial processes are the predominant anthropogenic sources of emissions of heavy metals into the atmosphere, Acknowledging that heavy metals are natural constituents of the Earth's crust and that many heavy metals in certain forms and appropriate concentrations are essential to life, Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on the emissions, geochemical processes, atmospheric transport and effects on human health and the environment of heavy metals, as well as on abatement techniques and costs, Aware that techniques and management practices are available to reduce air pollution caused by the emissions of heavy metals, Recognizing that countries in the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) have different economic conditions, and that in certain countries the economies are in transition, Resolved to take measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize emissions of certain heavy metals and their related compounds, taking into account the application of the precautionary approach, as set forth in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, Mindful that measures to control emissions of heavy metals would also contribute to the protection of the environment and human health in areas outside the UN/ECE region, including the Arctic and international waters, Noting that abating the emissions of specific heavy metals may provide additional benefits for the abatement of emissions of other pollutants, Aware that further and more effective action to control and reduce emissions of certain heavy metals may be needed and that, for example, effects-based studies may provide a basis for further action, Noting the important contribution of the private and non-governmental sectors to knowledge of the effects associated with heavy metals, available alternatives and abatement techniques, and their role in assisting in the reduction of emissions of heavy metals, Bearing in mind the activities related to the control of heavy metals at the national level and in international forums, Have agreed as follows:

### Annex  III  

####Best available techniques for controlling emissions of heavy metals and their compounds from the source categories listed in Annex II

### I  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

This annex aims to provide Parties with guidance on identifying best available techniques for stationary sources to enable them to meet the obligations of the Protocol.  

### 2  

“Best available techniques" (BAT) means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing in principle the basis for emission limit values designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and their impact on the environment as a whole: 

– “Techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;  

– “Available" techniques means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the territory of the Party in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;  

– “Best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.   In determining the best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the factors below, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and the principles of precaution and prevention: 

– The use of low-waste technology;  

– The use of less hazardous substances;  

– The furthering of recovery and recycling of substances generated and used in the process and of waste;  

– Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;  

– Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;  

– The nature, effects and volume of the emissions concerned;  

– The commissioning dates for new or existing installations;  

– The time needed to introduce the best available technique;  

– The consumption and nature of raw materials (including water) used in the process and its energy efficiency;  

– The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the emissions on the environment and the risks to it;  

– The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment.   The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.  

### 3  

The information regarding emission control performance and costs is based on official documentation of the Executive Body and its subsidiary bodies, in particular documents received and reviewed by the Task Force on Heavy Metal Emissions and the Ad Hoc Preparatory Working Group on Heavy Metals. Furthermore, other international information on best available techniques for emission control has been taken into consideration (e.g. the European Community's technical notes on BAT, the PARCOM recommendations for BAT, and information provided directly by experts).  

### 4  

Experience with new products and new plants incorporating lowe- emission techniques, as well as with the retrofitting of existing plants, is growing continuously; this annex may, therefore, need amending and updating.  

### 5  

The annex lists a number of measures spanning a range of costs and efficiencies. The choice of measures for any particular case will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, such as economic circumstances, technological infrastructure, any existing emission control device, safety, energy consumption and whether the source is a new or existing one.  

### 6  

This annex takes into account the emissions of cadmium, lead and mercury and their compounds, in solid (particle-bound) and/or gaseous form. Speciation of these compounds is, in general, not considered here. Nevertheless, the efficiency of emission control devices with regard to the physical properties of the heavy metal, especially in the case of mercury, has been taken into account.  

### 7  

Emission values expressed as mg/m <sup>3</sup> refer to standard conditions (volume at 273.15 K, 101.3 kPa, dry gas) not corrected for oxygen content unless otherwise specified, and are calculated in accordance with draft CEN (Comité européen de normalisation) and, in some cases, national sampling and monitoring techniques.  

### II  

####GENERAL OPTIONS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS OF HEAVY METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS

### 8  

There are several possibilities for controlling or preventing heavy metal emissions. Emission reduction measures focus on add-on technologies and process modifications (including maintenance and operating control). The following measures, which may be implemented depending on the wider technical and/or economic conditions, are available: 

a) Application of low-emission process technologies, in particular in new installations;  

b) Off-gas cleaning (secondary reduction measures) with filters, scrubbers, absorbers, etc.;  

c) Change or preparation of raw materials, fuels and/or other feed materials (e.g. use of raw materials with low heavy metal content);  

d) Best management practices such as good housekeeping, preventive maintenance programmes, or primary measures such as the enclosure of dust-creating units;  

e) Appropriate environmental management techniques for the use and disposal of certain products containing Cd, Pb, and/or Hg.    

### 9  

It is necessary to monitor abatement procedures to ensure that appropriate control measures and practices are properly implemented and achieve an effective emission reduction. Monitoring abatement procedures will include: 

a) Developing an inventory of those reduction measures identified above that have already been implemented;  

b) Comparing actual reductions in Cd, Pb and Hg emissions with the objectives of the Protocol;  

c) Characterizing quantified emissions of Cd, Pb and Hg from relevant sources with appropriate techniques;  

d) Regulatory authorities periodically auditing abatement measures to ensure their continued efficient operation.    

### 10  

Emission reduction measures should be cost-efficient. Cost-efficient strategy considerations should be based on total costs per year per unit abated (including capital and operating costs). Emission reduction costs should also be considered with respect to the overall process.  

### III  

####CONTROL TECHNIQUES

### 11  

The major categories of available control techniques for Cd, Pb and Hg emission abatement are primary measures such as raw material and/or fuel substitution and low-emission process technologies, and secondary measures such as fugitive emission control and off-gas cleaning. Sector-specific techniques are specified in chapter IV.  

### 12  

The data on efficiency are derived from operating experience and are considered to reflect the capabilities of current installations. The overall efficiency of flue gas and fugitive emission reductions depends to a great extent on the evacuation performance of the gas and dust collectors (e.g. suction hoods). Capture/collection efficiencies of over 99 per cent have been demonstrated. In particular cases experience has shown that control measures are able to reduce overall emissions by 90 per cent or more.  

### 13  

In the case of particle-bound emissions of Cd, Pb and Hg, the metals can be captured by dust-cleaning devices. Typical dust concentrations after gas cleaning with selected techniques are given in table 1. Most of these measures have generally been applied across sectors. The minimum expected performance of selected techniques for capturing gaseous mercury is outlined in table 2. The application of these measures depends on the specific processes and is most relevant if concentrations of mercury in the flue gas are high. 
### *Table 1: Performance of dust-cleaning devices expressed as hourly average dust concentrations*

Note: Medium- and low-pressure scrubbers and cyclones generally show lower dust removal efficiencies.

### 14  

Care should be taken to ensure that these control techniques do not create other environmental problems. The choice of a specific process because of its low emission into the air should be avoided if it worsens the total environmental impact of the heavy metals' discharge, e.g. due to more water pollution from liquid effluents. The fate of captured dust resulting from improved gas cleaning must also be taken into consideration. A negative environmental impact from the handling of such wastes will reduce the gain from lower process dust and fume emissions into the air.  

### 15  

Emission reduction measures can focus on process techniques as well as on off-gas cleaning. The two are not independent of each other; the choice of a specific process might exclude some gas-cleaning methods.  

### 16  

The choice of a control technique will depend on such parameters as the pollutant concentration and/or speciation in the raw gas, the gas volume flow, the gas temperature, and others. Therefore, the fields of application may overlap; in that case, the most appropriate technique must be selected according to case-specific conditions.  

### 17  

Adequate measures to reduce stack gas emissions in various sectors are described below. Fugitive emissions have to be taken into account. Dust emission control associated with the discharging, handling, and stockpiling of raw materials or by-products, although not relevant to long-range transport, may be important for the local environment. The emissions can be reduced by moving these activities to completely enclosed buildings, which may be equipped with ventilation and dedusting facilities, spray systems or other suitable controls. When stockpiling in unroofed areas, the material surface should be otherwise protected against wind entrainment. Stockpiling areas and roads should be kept clean.  

### 18  

The investment/cost figures listed in the tables have been collected from various sources and are highly case-specific. They are expressed in 1990 US$ (US$ 1 (1990) = ECU 0.8 (1990)). They depend on such factors as plant capacity, removal efficiency and raw gas concentration, type of technology, and the choice of new installations as opposed to retrofitting.  

### IV  

####SECTORS

### 19  

This chapter contains a table per relevant sector with the main emission sources, control measures based on the best available techniques, their specific reduction efficiency and the related costs, where available. Unless stated otherwise, the reduction efficiencies in the tables refer to direct stack gas emissions.  

#### *Combustion of fossil fuels in utility and industrial boilers (annex II, category 1)* 

### 20  

The combustion of coal in utility and industrial boilers is a major source of anthropogenic mercury emissions. The heavy metal content is normally several orders of magnitude higher in coal than in oil or natural gas.  

### 21  

Improved energy conversion efficiency and energy conservation measures will result in a decline in the emissions of heavy metals because of reduced fuel requirements. Combusting natural gas or alternative fuels with a low heavy metal content instead of coal would also result in a significant reduction in heavy metal emissions such as mercury. Integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant technology is a new plant technology with a low-emission potential.  

### 22  

With the exception of mercury, heavy metals are emitted in solid form in association with fly-ash particles. Different coal combustion technologies show different magnitudes of fly-ash generation: grate-firing boilers 20–40%; fluidized-bed combustion 15%; dry bottom boilers (pulverized coal combustion) 70–100% of total ash. The heavy metal content in the small particle size fraction of the fly-ash has been found to be higher.  

### 23  

Beneficiation, e.g. “washing" or “bio-treatment", of coal reduces the heavy metal content associated with the inorganic matter in the coal. However, the degree of heavy metal removal with this technology varies widely.  

### 24  

A total dust removal of more than 99.5% can be obtained with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) or fabric filters (FF), achieving dust concentrations of about 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup> in many cases. With the exception of mercury, heavy metal emissions can be reduced by at least 90–99%, the lower figure for the more easily volatilized elements. Low filter temperature helps to reduce the gaseous mercury off-gas content.  

### 25  

The application of techniques to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulates from the flue gas can also remove heavy metals. Possible cross media impact should be avoided by appropriate waste water treatment.  

### 26  

Using the techniques mentioned above, mercury removal efficiencies vary extensively from plant to plant, as seen in table 3. Research is ongoing to develop mercury removal techniques, but until such techniques are available on an industrial scale, no best available technique is identified for the specific purpose of removing mercury. 
### *Table 3: Control measures, reduction efficiencies and costs for fossil-fuel combustion emissions* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Reduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Combustion of fuel oil  | Switch from fuel oil to gas  | Cd, Pb: 100;  Hg: 70–80  | Highly case-specific  |
| Combustion of coal  | Switch from coal to fuels with lower heavy metals emissions  | Dust: 70–100  | Highly case-specific  |
| ESP (cold-side)  | Cd, Pb: > 90;  Hg: 10–40  | Specific investment US$ 5–10/m <sup>3</sup> waste gas per hour (> 200,000 m <sup>3</sup> /h)  |

Reduction in heavy metal emissions is a side benefit. (Specific investment US$ 60–250/kW <sub>el</sub>.)    </sup> | ..  |
| Fabric filters (FF)  | Cd: > 95;  Pb: > 99;  Hg: 10–60  | Specific investment US$ 8–15/m <sup>3</sup> waste gas per hour (> 200,000 m <sup>3</sup> /h)  |

#### *Primary iron and steel industry (annex II, category 2)* 

### 27  

This section deals with emissions from sinter plants, pellet plants, blast furnaces, and steelworks with a basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Emissions of Cd, Pb and Hg occur in association with particulates. The content of the heavy metals of concern in the emitted dust depends on the composition of the raw materials and the types of alloying metals added in steel-making. The most relevant emission reduction measures are outlined in table 4. Fabric filters should be used whenever possible; if conditions make this impossible, electrostatic precipitators and/or high-efficiency scrubbers may be used.  

### 28  

When using BAT in the primary iron and steel industry, the total specific emission of dust directly related to the process can be reduced to the following levels:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| Sinter plants  | 40 – 120 g/Mg  |
| Pellet plants  | 40 g/Mg  |
| Blast furnace  | 35 – 50 g/Mg  |
| BOF  | 35 – 70 g/Mg.  |

### 29  

Purification of gases using fabric filters will reduce the dust content to less than 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>, whereas electrostatic precipitators and scrubbers will reduce the dust content to 50 mg/m <sup>3</sup> (as an hourly average). However, there are many applications of fabric filters in the primary iron and steel industry that can achieve much lower values. 
### *Table 4: Emission sources, control measures, dust reduction efficiencies and costs for the primary iron and steel industry* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Dustreduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs (total costs US$)*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Sinter plants  | Emission optimized sintering  | ca. 50  | ..  |
| Scrubbers and ESP  | > 90  | ..  |
| Fabric filters  | > 99  | ..  |
| Pellet plants  | ESP + lime reactor + fabric filters  | > 99  | ..  |
| Scrubbers  | > 95  | ..  |
| Blast furnaces  | FF / ESP  | > 99  | ESP: 0.24–1/Mg pig-iron  |
| Blast furnace gas cleaning  | Wet scrubbers  | > 99  | ..  |
| --- | Wet ESP  | > 99  | ..  |
| BOF  | Primary dedusting: wet separator/ESP/FF  | > 99  | Dry ESP: 2.25/Mg steel  |
| --- | Secondary dedusting: dry ESP/FF  | > 97  | FF: 0.26/Mg steel  |
| Fugitive emissions  | Closed conveyor belts, enclosure, wetting stored feedstock, cleaning of roads  | 80–99  | ..  |

### 30  

Direct reduction and direct smelting are under development and may reduce the need for sinter plants and blast furnaces in the future. The application of these technologies depends on the ore characteristics and requires the resulting product to be processed in an electric arc furnace, which should be equipped with appropriate controls.  

#### *Secondary iron and steel industry (annex II, category 3)* 

### 31  

It is very important to capture all the emissions efficiently. That is possible by installing doghouses or movable hoods or by total building evacuation. The captured emissions must be cleaned. For all dust-emitting processes in the secondary iron and steel industry, dedusting in fabric filters, which reduces the dust content to less than 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>, shall be considered as BAT. When BAT is used also for minimizing fugitive emissions, the specific dust emission (including fugitive emission directly related to the process) will not exceed the range of 0.1 to 0.35 kg/Mg steel. There are many examples of clean gas dust content below 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> when fabric filters are used. The specific dust emission in such cases is normally below 0.1 kg/Mg.  

### 32  

For the melting of scrap, two different types of furnace are in use: open-hearth furnaces and electric arc furnaces (EAF) where open-hearth furnaces are about to be phased out.  

### 33  

The content of the heavy metals of concern in the emitted dust depends on the composition of the iron and steel scrap and the types of alloying metals added in steel-making. Measurements at EAF have shown that 95% of emitted mercury and 25% of cadmium emissions occur as vapour. The most relevant dust emission reduction measures are outlined in table 5. 
### *Table 5: Emission sources, control measures, dust reduction efficiencies and costs for the secondary iron and steel industry* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Dust reduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs (total costs US$)*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| EAF  | ESP  | > 99   | ..  |
| --- | FF  | > 99.5  | FF: 24/Mg steel  |

#### *Iron foundries (annex II, category 4)* 

### 34  

It is very important to capture all the emissions efficiently. That is possible by installing doghouses or movable hoods or by total building evacuation. The captured emissions must be cleaned. In iron foundries, cupola furnaces, electric arc furnaces and induction furnaces are operated. Direct particulate and gaseous heavy metal emissions are especially associated with melting and sometimes, to a small extent, with pouring. Fugitive emissions arise from raw material handling, melting, pouring and fettling. The most relevant emission reduction measures are outlined in table 6 with their achievable reduction efficiencies and costs, where available. These measures can reduce dust concentrations to 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>, or less. 
### *Table 6: Emission sources, control measures, dust reduction efficiencies and costs for iron foundries* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Dustreduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs (total costs US$)*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| EAF  | ESP  | > 99  | ..  |
| --- | FF  | > 99.5  | FF: 24/Mg iron  |
| Induction furnace  | FF/dry absorption + FF  | > 99  | ..  |
| Cold blast cupola  | Below-the-door take-off: FF  | > 98  | ..  |
| Above-the-door take-off:  | --- | --- |
| FF + pre-dedusting  | > 97  | 8–12/Mg iron  |
| FF + chemisorption  | > 99  | 45/Mg iron  |
| Hot blast cupola  | FF + pre-dedusting  | > 99  | 23/Mg iron  |
| --- | Disintegrator/ venturi scrubber  | > 97  | ..  |

### 35  

The iron foundry industry comprises a very wide range of process sites. For existing smaller installations, the measures listed may not be BAT if they are not economically viable.  

#### *Primary and secondary non-ferrous metal industry (annex II, categories 5 and 6)* 

### 36  

This section deals with emissions and emission control of Cd, Pb and Hg in the primary and secondary production of non-ferrous metals like lead, copper, zinc, tin and nickel. Due to the large number of different raw materials used and the various processes applied, nearly all kinds of heavy metals and heavy metal compounds might be emitted from this sector. Given the heavy metals of concern in this annex, the production of copper, lead and zinc are particularly relevant.  

### 37  

Mercury ores and concentrates are initially processed by crushing, and sometimes screening. Ore beneficiation techniques are not used extensively, although flotation has been used at some facilities processing low-grade ore. The crushed ore is then heated in either retorts, at small operations, or furnaces, at large operations, to the temperatures at which mercuric sulphide sublimates. The resulting mercury vapour is condensed in a cooling system and collected as mercury metal. Soot from the condensers and settling tanks should be removed, treated with lime and returned to the retort or furnace.  

### 38  

For efficient recovery of mercury the following techniques can be used: 

– Measures to reduce dust generation during mining and stockpiling, including minimizing the size of stockpiles;  

– Indirect heating of the furnace;  

– Keeping the ore as dry as possible;  

– Bringing the gas temperature entering the condenser to only 10 to 20°C above the dew point;  

– Keeping the outlet temperature as low as possible; and  

– Passing reaction gases through a post-condensation scrubber and/or a selenium filter.   Dust formation can be kept down by indirect heating, separate processing of fine grain classes of ore, and control of ore water content. Dust should be removed from the hot reaction gas before it enters the mercury condensation unit with cyclones and/or electrostatic precipitators.  

### 39  

For gold production by amalgamation, similar strategies as for mercury can be applied. Gold is also produced using techniques other than amalgamation, and these are considered to be the preferred option for new plants.  

### 40  

Non-ferrous metals are mainly produced from sulphitic ores. For technical and product quality reasons, the off-gas must go through a thorough dedusting (< 3 mg/m <sup>3</sup>) and could also require additional mercury removal before being fed to an SO3 contact plant, thereby also minimizing heavy metal emissions.  

### 41  

Fabric filters should be used when appropriate. A dust content of less than 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> can be obtained. The dust of all pyrometallurgical production should be recycled in-plant or off-site, while protecting occupational health.  

### 42  

For primary lead production, first experiences indicate that there are interesting new direct smelting reduction technologies without sintering of the concentrates. These processes are examples of a new generation of direct autogenous lead smelting technologies which pollute less and consume less energy.  

### 43  

Secondary lead is mainly produced from used car and truck batteries, which are dismantled before being charged to the smelting furnace. This BAT should include one melting operation in a short rotary furnace or shaft furnace. Oxy-fuel burners can reduce waste gas volume and flue dust production by 60%. Cleaning the flue-gas with fabric filters makes it possible to achieve dust concentration levels of 5 mg/m <sup>3</sup>.  

### 44  

Primary zinc production is carried out by means of roast-leach electrowin technology. Pressure leaching may be an alternative to roasting and may be considered as a BAT for new plants depending on the concentrate characteristics. Emissions from pyrometallurgical zinc production in Imperial Smelting (IS) furnaces can be minimized by using a double bell furnace top and cleaning with high-efficiency scrubbers, efficient evacuation and cleaning of gases from slag and lead casting, and thorough cleaning (< 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>) of the CO-rich furnace off-gases.  

### 45  

To recover zinc from oxidized residues these are processed in an IS furnace. Very low-grade residues and flue dust (e.g. from the steel industry) are first treated in rotary furnaces (Waelz-furnaces) in which a high-content zinc oxide is manufactured. Metallic materials are recycled through melting in either induction furnaces or furnaces with direct or indirect heating by natural gas or liquid fuels or in vertical New Jersey retorts, in which a large variety of oxidic and metallic secondary material can be recycled. Zinc can also be recovered from lead furnace slags by a slag fuming process.

| Zinc production  | Imperial smelting  | > 95  | 14/Mg Zn  |

### 46  

In general, processes should be combined with an effective dust collecting device for both primary gases and fugitive emissions. The most relevant emission reduction measures are outlined in tables 7 a) and b). Dust concentrations below 5 mg/m <sup>3</sup> have been achieved in some cases using fabric filters.  

#### *Cement industry (annex II, category 7)* 

### 47  

Cement kilns may use secondary fuels such as waste oil or waste tyres. Where waste is used, emission requirements for waste incineration processes may apply, and where hazardous waste is used, depending on the amount used in the plant, emission requirements for hazardous waste incineration processes may apply. However, this section refers to fossil fuel fired kilns.  

### 48  

Particulates are emitted at all stages of the cement production process, consisting of material handling, raw material preparation (crushers, dryers), clinker production and cement preparation. Heavy metals are brought into the cement kiln with the raw materials, fossil and waste fuels.  

### 49  

For clinker production the following kiln types are available: long wet rotary kiln, long dry rotary kiln, rotary kiln with cyclone preheater, rotary kiln with grate preheater, shaft furnace. In terms of energy demand and emission control opportunities, rotary kilns with cyclone preheaters are preferable.  

### 50  

For heat recovery purposes, rotary kiln off-gases are conducted through the preheating system and the mill dryers (where installed) before being dedusted. The collected dust is returned to the feed material.  

### 51  

Less than 0.5% of lead and cadmium entering the kiln is released in exhaust gases. The high alkali content and the scrubbing action in the kiln favour metal retention in the clinker or kiln dust.  

### 52  

The emissions of heavy metals into the air can be reduced by, for instance, taking off a bleed stream and stockpiling the collected dust instead of returning it to the raw feed. However, in each case these considerations should be weighed against the consequences of releasing the heavy metals into the waste stockpile. Another possibility is the hot-meal bypass, where calcined hot-meal is in part discharged right in front of the kiln entrance and fed to the cement preparation plant. Alternatively, the dust can be added to the clinker. Another important measure is a very well controlled steady operation of the kiln in order to avoid emergency shut-offs of the electrostatic precipitators. These may be caused by excessive CO concentrations. It is important to avoid high peaks of heavy metal emissions in the event of such an emergency shut-off.  

### 53  

The most relevant emission reduction measures are outlined in table 8. To reduce direct dust emissions from crushers, mills, and dryers, fabric filters are mainly used, whereas kiln and clinker cooler waste gases are controlled by electrostatic precipitators. With ESP, dust can be reduced to concentrations below 50 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. When FF are used, the clean gas dust content can be reduced to 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. 
### *Table 8: Emission sources, control measures, reduction efficiencies and costs for the cement industry* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Reduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Direct emissions from crushers, mills, dryers  | FF  | Cd, Pb: > 95  | ..  |
| Direct emissions from rotary kilns, clinker coolers  | ESP  | Cd, Pb: > 95  | ..  |
| Direct emissions from rotary kilns  | Carbon adsorption  | Hg: > 95  | ..  |

#### *Glass industry (annex II, category 8)* 

### 54  

In the glass industry, lead emissions are particularly relevant given the various types of glass in which lead is introduced as raw material (e.g. crystal glass, cathode ray tubes). In the case of soda-lime container glass, lead emissions depend on the quality of the recycled glass used in the process. The lead content in dusts from crystal glass melting is usually about 20–60%.  

### 55  

Dust emissions stem mainly from batch mixing, furnaces, diffuse leakages from furnace openings, and finishing and blasting of glass products. They depend notably on the type of fuel used, the furnace type and the type of glass produced. Oxy-fuel burners can reduce waste gas volume and flue dust production by 60%. The lead emissions from electrical heating are considerably lower than from oil/gas-firing.  

### 56  

The batch is melted in continuous tanks, day tanks or crucibles. During the melting cycle using discontinuous furnaces, the dust emission varies greatly. The dust emissions from crystal glass tanks (<5 kg/Mg melted glass) are higher than from other tanks (<1 kg/Mg melted soda and potash glass).  

### 57  

Some measures to reduce direct metal-containing dust emissions are: pelleting the glass batch, changing the heating system from oil/gas-firing to electrical heating, charging a larger share of glass returns in the batch, and applying a better selection of raw materials (size distribution) and recycled glass (avoiding lead-containing fractions). Exhaust gases can be cleaned in fabric filters, reducing the emissions below 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. With electrostatic precipitators 30 mg/m <sup>3</sup> is achieved. The corresponding emission reduction efficiencies are given in table 9.  

### 58  

The development of crystal glass without lead compounds is in progress. 
### *Table 9: Emission sources, control measures, dust reduction efficiencies and costs for the glass industry* 

|  *Emission source*   |  *Control measure(s)*   |  *Dust reduction efficiency (%)*   |  *Abatement costs (total costs)*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Direct emissions  | FF  | > 98  | ..  |
| ESP  | > 90  | ..  |

#### *Chlor-alkali industry (annex II, category 9)* 

### 59  

In the chlor-alkali industry, Cl <sub>2</sub>, alkali hydroxides and hydrogen are produced through electrolysis of a salt solution. Commonly used in existing plants are the mercury process and the diaphragm process, both of which need the introduction of good practices to avoid environmental problems. The membrane process results in no direct mercury emissions. Moreover, it shows a lower electrolytic energy and higher heat demand for alkali hydroxide concentration (the global energy balance resulting in a slight advantage for membrane cell technology in the range of 10 to 15%) and a more compact cell operation. It is, therefore, considered as the preferred option for new plants. Decision 90/3 of 14 June 1990 of the Commission for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources (PARCOM) recommends that existing mercury cell chlor-alkali plants should be phased out as soon as practicable with the objective of phasing them out completely by 2010.  

### 60  

The specific investment for replacing mercury cells by the membrane process is reported to be in the region of US$ 700–1000/Mg Cl <sub>2</sub> capacity. Although additional costs may result from, *inter alia*, higher utility costs and brine purification cost, the operating cost will in most cases decrease. This is due to savings mainly from lower energy consumption, and lower waste-water treatment and waste-disposal costs.  

### 61  

The sources of mercury emissions into the environment in the mercury process are: cell room ventilation; process exhausts; products, particularly hydrogen; and waste water. With regard to emissions into air, Hg diffusely emitted from the cells to the cell room are particularly relevant. Preventive measures and control are of great importance and should be prioritized according to the relative importance of each source at a particular installation. In any case specific control measures are required when mercury is recovered from sludges resulting from the process.  

### 62  

The following measures can be taken to reduce emissions from existing mercury process plants: 

– Process control and technical measures to optimize cell operation, maintenance and more efficient working methods;  

– Coverings, sealings and controlled bleeding-off by suction;  

– Cleaning of cell rooms and measures that make it easier to keep them clean; and  

– Cleaning of limited gas streams (certain contaminated air streams and hydrogen gas).    

### 63  

These measures can cut mercury emissions to values well below 2.0 g/Mg of Cl <sub>2</sub> production capacity, expressed as an annual average. There are examples of plants that achieve emissions well below 1.0 g/Mg of Cl <sub>2</sub> production capacity. As a result of PARCOM decision 90/3, existing mercury-based chlor-alkali plants were required to meet the level of 2 g of Hg/Mg of Cl <sub>2</sub> by 31 December 1996 for emissions covered by the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources. Since emissions depend to a large extent on good operating practices, the average should depend on and include maintenance periods of one year or less.  

#### *Municipal, medical and hazardous waste incineration (annex II, categories 10 and 11)* 

### 64  

Emissions of cadmium, lead and mercury result from the incineration of municipal, medical and hazardous waste. Mercury, a substantial part of cadmium and minor parts of lead are volatilized in the process. Particular actions should be taken both before and after incineration to reduce these emissions.  

### 65  

The best available technology for dedusting is considered to be fabric filters in combination with dry or wet methods for controlling volatiles. Electrostatic precipitators in combination with wet systems can also be designed to reach low dust emissions, but they offer fewer opportunities than fabric filters especially with pre-coating for adsorption of volatile pollutants.  

### 66  

When BAT is used for cleaning the flue gases, the concentration of dust will be reduced to a range of 10 to 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>; in practice lower concentrations are reached, and in some cases concentrations of less than 1 mg/m <sup>3</sup> have been reported. The concentration of mercury can be reduced to a range of 0.05 to 0.10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> (normalized to 11% O <sub>2</sub>).  

### 67  

The most relevant secondary emission reduction measures are outlined in table 10. It is difficult to provide generally valid data because the relative costs in US$/tonne depend on a particularly wide range of site-specific variables, such as waste composition.  

### 68  

Heavy metals are found in all fractions of the municipal waste stream (e.g. products, paper, organic materials). Therefore, by reducing the quantity of municipal waste that is incinerated, heavy metal emissions can be reduced. This can be accomplished through various waste management strategies, including recycling programmes and the composting of organic materials. In addition, some UN/ECE countries allow municipal waste to be landfilled. In a properly managed landfill, emissions of cadmium and lead are eliminated and mercury emissions may be lower than with incineration. Research on emissions of mercury from landfills is taking place in several UN/ECE countries.

### Annex  IV  

####Timescales for the application of limit values and best available techniques to new and existing stationary sources

The timescales for the application of limit values and best available techniques are: 

a) For new stationary sources: two years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol;  

b) For existing stationary sources: eight years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol. If necessary, this period may be extended for specific existing stationary sources in accordance with the amortization period provided for by national legislation.     

### Annex  V  

####Limit values for controlling emissions from major stationary sources

### I  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

Two types of limit value are important for heavy metal emission control: 

– Values for specific heavy metals or groups of heavy metals; and  

– Values for emissions of particulate matter in general.    

### 2  

In principle, limit values for particulate matter cannot replace specific limit values for cadmium, lead and mercury, because the quantity of metals associated with particulate emissions differs from one process to another. However, compliance with these limits contributes significantly to reducing heavy metal emissions in general. Moreover, monitoring particulate emissions is generally less expensive than monitoring individual species and continuous monitoring of individual heavy metals is in general not feasible. Therefore, particulate limit values are of great practical importance and are also laid down in this annex in most cases to complement or replace specific limit values for cadmium or lead or mercury.  

### 3  

Limit values, expressed as mg/m <sup>3</sup>, refer to standard conditions (volume at 273.15 K, 101.3 kPa, dry gas) and are calculated as an average value of one-hour measurements, covering several hours of operation, as a rule 24 hours. Periods of start-up and shutdown should be excluded. The averaging time may be extended when required to achieve sufficiently precise monitoring results. With regard to the oxygen content of the waste gas, the values given for selected major stationary sources shall apply. Any dilution for the purpose of lowering concentrations of pollutants in waste gases is forbidden. Limit values for heavy metals include the solid, gaseous and vapour form of the metal and its compounds, expressed as the metal. Whenever limit values for total emissions are given, expressed as g/unit of production or capacity respectively, they refer to the sum of stack and fugitive emissions, calculated as an annual value.  

### 4  

In cases in which an exceeding of given limit values cannot be excluded, either emissions or a performance parameter that indicates whether a control device is being properly operated and maintained shall be monitored. Monitoring of either emissions or performance indicators should take place continuously if the emitted mass flow of particulates is above 10 kg/h. If emissions are monitored, the concentrations of air pollutants in gas-carrying ducts have to be measured in a representative fashion. If particulate matter is monitored discontinuously, the concentrations should be measured at regular intervals, taking at least three independent readings per check. Sampling and analysis of all pollutants as well as reference measurement methods to calibrate automated measurement systems shall be carried out according to the standards laid down by the Comité européen de normalisation (CEN) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). While awaiting the development of the CEN or ISO standards, national standards shall apply. National standards can also be used if they provide equivalent results to CEN or ISO standards.  

### 5  

In the case of continuous monitoring, compliance with the limit values is achieved if none of the calculated average 24-hour emission concentrations exceeds the limit value or if the 24-hour average of the monitored parameter does not exceed the correlated value of that parameter that was established during a performance test when the control device was being properly operated and maintained. In the case of discontinuous emission monitoring, compliance is achieved if the average reading per check does not exceed the value of the limit. Compliance with each of the limit values expressed as total emissions per unit of production or total annual emissions is achieved if the monitored value is not exceeded, as described above.

### Annex  VII  

####Product management measures

### 1  

This annex aims to provide guidance to Parties on product management measures.  

### 2  

The Parties may consider appropriate product management measures such as those listed below, where warranted as a result of the potential risk of adverse effects on human health or the environment from emissions of one or more of the heavy metals listed in annex I, taking into account all relevant risks and benefits of such measures, with a view to ensuring that any changes to products result in an overall reduction of harmful effects on human health and the environment: 

a) The substitution of products containing one or more intentionally added heavy metals listed in annex I, if a suitable alternative exists;  

b) The minimization or substitution in products of one or more intentionally added heavy metals listed in annex I;  

c) The provision of product information including labelling to ensure that users are informed of the content of one or more intentionally added heavy metals listed in annex I and of the need for safe use and waste handling;  

d) The use of economic incentives or voluntary agreements to reduce or eliminate the content in products of the heavy metals listed in annex I; and  

e) The development and implementation of programmes for the collection, recycling or disposal of products containing one of the heavy metals in annex I in an environmentally sound manner.    

### 3  

Each product or product group listed below contains one or more of the heavy metals listed in annex I and is the subject of regulatory or voluntary action by at least one Party to the Convention based for a significant part on the contribution of that product to emissions of one or more of the heavy metals in annex I. However, sufficient information is not yet available to confirm that they are a significant source for all Parties, thereby warranting inclusion in annex VI. Each Party is encouraged to consider available information and, where satisfied of the need to take precautionary measures, to apply product management measures such as those listed in paragraph 2 above to one or more of the products listed below: 

a) Mercury-containing electrical components, i.e. devices that contain one or several contacts/sensors for the transfer of electrical current such as relays, thermostats, level switches, pressure switches and other switches (actions taken include a ban on most mercury-containing electrical components; voluntary programmes to replace some mercury switches with electronic or special switches; voluntary recycling programmes for switches; and voluntary recycling programmes for thermostats);  

b) Mercury-containing measuring devices such as thermometers, manometers, barometers, pressure gauges, pressure switches and pressure transmitters (actions taken include a ban on mercury-containing thermometers and ban on measuring instruments);

### Artikel  11  

####Beslechting van geschillen

1.  In geval van een geschil tussen twee of meer Partijen betreffende de uitleg of toepassing van dit Protocol trachten de betrokken Partijen het geschil te beslechten door middel van onderhandelingen of op een andere vreedzame wijze van hun eigen keuze. De Partijen bij het geschil stellen het uitvoerend orgaan in kennis van hun geschil.   
2.  Bij de bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van dan wel toetreding tot dit Protocol of op enig tijdstip daarna kan een Partij die geen regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, in een schriftelijke bij de depositaris ingediende akte verklaren dat zij, met betrekking tot een geschil betreffende de uitleg of toepassing van het Protocol, beide onderstaande wijzen van geschillenbeslechting of een daarvan ipso facto en zonder bijzondere overeenkomst als dwingend erkent ten opzichte van elke Partij die dezelfde verplichting aanvaardt: 

a. Voorlegging van het geschil aan het Internationale Gerechtshof;  

b. Arbitrage in overeenstemming met procedures die zo spoedig mogelijk door de Partijen op een zitting van het uitvoerend orgaan moeten worden aangenomen in een bijlage inzake arbitrage.   Een Partij die een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, kan een verklaring van gelijke strekking met betrekking tot arbitrage afleggen in overeenstemming met de onder b bedoelde procedures.   
3.  Een ingevolge lid 2 afgelegde verklaring blijft van kracht totdat zij overeenkomstig haar bepalingen haar geldigheid verliest dan wel tot drie maanden nadat een schriftelijke kennisgeving van opzegging is nedergelegd bij de depositaris.   
4.  Een nieuwe verklaring, een kennisgeving van opzegging of het vervallen van de geldigheid van een verklaring zijn op generlei wijze van invloed op de procedure voor het Internationale Gerechtshof of het scheidsgerecht, tenzij de Partijen bij het geschil anders overeenkomen.   
5.  Indien de Partijen bij het geschil, behalve ingeval de betrokken Partijen dezelfde wijze van geschillenbeslechting overeenkomstig lid 2 hebben aanvaard, er na twaalf maanden te rekenen vanaf de kennisgeving van de ene Partij aan de andere dat tussen hen een geschil bestaat, niet in zijn geslaagd hun geschil te beslechten op de in lid 1 bedoelde wijzen, wordt het geschil op verzoek van een van de Partijen bij het geschil onderworpen aan een conciliatie.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van lid 5 wordt een conciliatiecommissie opgericht. De commissie bestaat uit een gelijk aantal leden, die zijn benoemd door elke betrokken Partij of, wanneer bij de conciliatie betrokken Partijen eenzelfde belang hebben, door de groep die datzelfde belang heeft, en een voorzitter die door de aldus benoemde leden gezamenlijk is gekozen. De commissie doet uitspraak in de vorm van een aanbeveling, die de Partijen te goeder trouw in overweging nemen.

### Bijlage  III  

####Beste beschikbare technieken voor de beperking van de emissie van zware metalen en verbindingen daarvan door in Bijlage II vermelde categorieën van bronnen

### I  

####INLEIDING

### 1  

Deze bijlage is bedoeld om de Partijen bij het verdrag richtsnoeren te geven bij de bepaling van de beste beschikbare technieken zodat ze kunnen voldoen aan de verplichtingen van het Protocol.  

### 2  

Onder „beste beschikbare technieken" (BBT) wordt verstaan het meest doeltreffende en geavanceerde ontwikkelingsstadium van de activiteiten en exploitatiemethoden, waarbij de praktische bruikbaarheid van speciale technieken om in beginsel het uitgangspunt voor de emissiegrenswaarden te vormen is aangetoond, met het doel emissies en effecten op het milieu in zijn geheel te voorkomen, of wanneer dat niet mogelijk blijkt algemeen te beperken: 

– Onder „technieken" wordt verstaan zowel de toegepaste technieken als de wijze waarop de installatie wordt ontworpen, gebouwd, onderhouden, geëxploiteerd en ontmanteld;  

– Onder „beschikbare" technieken wordt verstaan op zodanige schaal ontwikkeld dat de betrokken technieken, kosten en baten in aanmerking genomen, economisch en technisch haalbaar in de betrokken industriële context kunnen worden toegepast, onafhankelijk van de vraag of die technieken al dan niet op het grondgebied van de betrokken lidstaat worden toegepast of geproduceerd, mits zij voor de exploitant op redelijke voorwaarden toegankelijk zijn;  

– Onder „beste" wordt verstaan het meest doeltreffend voor het bereiken van een hoog algemeen niveau van bescherming van het milieu in zijn geheel.   Bij de bepaling van de beste beschikbare technieken moet in het algemeen of in specifieke gevallen bijzondere aandacht worden besteed aan onderstaande factoren, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met de te verwachten kosten en baten van een maatregel en het voorzorg- en het preventiebeginsel: 

– Het gebruik van technologie die weinig afval oplevert;  

– Het gebruik van minder gevaarlijke stoffen;  

– De bevordering van terugwinning en recycling van stoffen die tijdens het proces ontstaan en worden gebruikt en van afvalstoffen;  

– Vergelijkbare processen, inrichtingen of exploitatiemethoden die met succes op industriële schaal zijn beproefd;  

– De vooruitgang van de techniek en de ontwikkeling van de wetenschappelijke kennis;  

– De aard, de effecten en de omvang van de emissie;  

– De data van ingebruikneming van de nieuwe of bestaande installaties;  

– De tijd die nodig is voor het omschakelen op een beste beschikbare techniek;  

– Het verbruik en de aard van de grondstoffen (met inbegrip van water) die bij het proces worden gebruikt en het rendement van de energie daarvan;  

– De noodzaak om de algehele milieueffecten en milieurisico's van de emissie te voorkomen of tot een minimum te beperken;  

– De noodzaak om ongevallen te voorkomen en de gevolgen daarvan voor het milieu tot een minimum te beperken.   Het is niet de bedoeling om aan de hand van het begrip beste beschikbare technieken bepaalde technieken of technologie voor te schrijven, maar om rekening te houden met de technische karakteristieken van de desbetreffende installatie, de geografische locatie en de plaatselijke milieusituatie.  

### 3  

De informatie over de effectiviteit en de kosten van beperkende maatregelen is gebaseerd op officiële documentatie van het uitvoerend orgaan en daaraan ondergeschikte lichamen, met name documenten die door de Task force emissie van zware metalen en de voorbereidende werkgroep ad hoc zware metalen zijn ontvangen en geëvalueerd. Voorts is andere internationale informatie over beste beschikbare technieken voor emissiebeperking in aanmerking genomen (bijvoorbeeld de technische notities inzake BBT van de Europese Gemeenschap, de PARCOM-aanbevelingen voor BBT en rechtstreeks door deskundigen verstrekte informatie).  

### 4  

Aangezien voortdurend nieuwe ervaring wordt opgedaan met nieuwe producten en nieuwe installaties waarin technieken met geringe emissie worden toegepast, alsook met de aanpassing van bestaande installaties, zal deze bijlage naar alle waarschijnlijkheid moeten worden gewijzigd en bijgewerkt.  

### 5  

De bijlage bevat een aantal qua kosten en rendement uiteenlopende maatregelen. De keuze van maatregelen voor een bepaald geval is afhankelijk van en kan worden beperkt door een aantal factoren, zoals economische omstandigheden, technologische infrastructuur, eventueel bestaande voorzieningen voor emissiebeperking, veiligheid, energieverbruik en of het een nieuwe dan wel bestaande bron betreft.  

### 6  

In deze bijlage wordt rekening gehouden met de emissies van cadmium, lood en kwik en verbindingen daarvan in vaste (deeltjesgebonden) en/of gasvorm. Er is in het algemeen geen onderscheid gemaakt naar de verschillende aggregatietoestanden van deze metalen. Er is niettemin rekening gehouden met de rendementen van voorzieningen voor emissiebeperking met betrekking tot de fysische eigenschappen van het zware metaal, met name in het geval van kwik.  

### 7  

Emissiewaarden, uitgedrukt in mg/m <sup>3</sup>, hebben betrekking op standaardcondities (volume bij 273,15 K, 101 kPa, droog gas), niet gecorrigeerd voor zuurstofgehalte, tenzij anders vermeld, en zijn berekend overeenkomstig ontwerp-CEN (Comité européen de normalisation)- en, in bepaalde gevallen, nationale bemonsterings- en monitoringtechnieken.  

### II  

####ALGEMENE OPTIES VOOR DE BEPERKING VAN DE EMISSIE VAN ZWARE METALEN EN VERBINDINGEN DAARVAN

### 8  

Er zijn verschillende mogelijkheden voor beheersing of voorkoming van emissies van zware metalen. Maatregelen voor emissiebeperking zijn toegespitst op nageschakelde technieken en wijzigingen in het proces (waaronder onderhoud en bedrijfsvoering). De volgende maatregelen, die afhankelijk van de overige technische en/of economische omstandigheden kunnen worden geïmplementeerd, zijn beschikbaar: 

a. Toepassing van procestechnologieën met geringe emissie, vooral in nieuwe installaties;  

b. Reiniging van afgas (secundaire beperkingsmaatregelen) met filters, wassers, absorbers enz.;  

c. Aanpassing of voorbehandeling van grondstoffen, brandstoffen en/of andere basismaterialen (bijvoorbeeld gebruik van grondstoffen met gering gehalte aan zware metalen);  

d. Milieuzorgsysteem zoals een goed beheer, preventieve onderhoudsprogramma's of primaire maatregelen zoals het omhullen van stofproducerende eenheden;  

e. Geschikte milieuzorgsysteem voor toepassing en verwijdering van bepaalde producten die Cd, Pb en/of Hg bevatten.    

### 9  

Het is noodzakelijk controle uit te oefenen op beperkingsprocedures om ervoor te zorgen dat geschikte emissiebeperkende maatregelen en -praktijken op de juiste wijze worden geïmplementeerd en tot een daadwerkelijke emissievermindering leiden. Onder controle van beperkingsprocedures vallen: 

a. Opstelling van een inventaris van de hierboven vermelde beperkingsmaatregelen die reeds zijn geïmplementeerd;  

b. Vergelijking van de werkelijke verminderingen in emissie van Cd, Pb en Hg met de doelstellingen van het Protocol;  

c. Karakterisering van gekwantificeerde emissies van Cd, Pb en Hg uit relevante bronnen met behulp van passende technieken;  

d. Periodieke audit van bestrijdingsmaatregelen door de bevoegde instanties om het blijvende rendement van de maatregelen te waarborgen.    

### 10  

Maatregelen voor emissiebeperking moeten kosteneffectief zijn. Strategische kosten-baten overwegingen moeten zijn gebaseerd op de totale kosten per jaar per eenheid emissiebeperking (inclusief investeringen en bedrijfskosten). De kosten van emissieverminderingen moeten eveneens in samenhang met het algehele proces worden bezien.  

### III  

####EMISSIEBEPERKENDE TECHNIEKEN

### 11  

De belangrijkste categorieën van beschikbare emissiebeperkende voor bestrijding van Cd, Pb en Hg-emissies zijn primaire maatregelen, zoals vervanging van grondstoffen en/of brandstoffen en procestechnologieën met geringe emissie, alsmede secundaire maatregelen, zoals beperking van diffuse emissies en rookgasreiniging. Sectorspecifieke technieken zijn in hoofdstuk IV vermeld.  

### 12  

De gegeven rendementen zijn gebaseerd op ervaring en worden geacht de mogelijkheden van bestaande installaties weer te geven. Het totale rendement inzake beperking van diffuse en rookgasemissies is grotendeels afhankelijk van het afvoervermogen van de gas- en stoffilters (bijvoorbeeld afzuigkappen). Er is aangetoond dat een vangstrendement van meer dan 99% kan worden bereikt. In bepaalde gevallen blijkt uit de ervaring dat emissiebeperkende maatregelen de totale emissie met 90% of meer kunnen verminderen.  

### 13  

Bij deeltjesgebonden emissies van Cd, Pb en Hg kunnen de metalen worden opgevangen door stoffilters. Tabel 1 geeft enkele karakteristieke stofconcentraties na gasreiniging met behulp van geselecteerde technieken. De meeste metingen hebben doorgaans betrekking op verschillende sectoren. Tabel 2 geeft de minimaal verwachte prestatie van geselecteerde technieken voor het opvangen van gasvormig kwik. De toepassing van deze maatregelen is afhankelijk van de specifieke processen en is vooral van betekenis indien de kwikconcentraties in het afgas hoog zijn. 
### *Tabel 1: Prestatie van ontstoffingssystemen, uitgedrukt als uur-gemiddelde stofconcentratie* 

|--- | Stofconcentraties na reiniging (mg/m <sup>3</sup>)  |
|:---|:---|
| Doekfilters  | < 10  |
| Doekfilters, membraantype  | < 1  |
| Droge elektrostatische stoffilters  | < 50  |
| Natte elektrostatische stoffilters  | < 50  |
| Hoogrendementswassers  | < 50  |

Opmerking: Wassers en cyclonen onder middelhoge en lage druk blijken doorgaans minder efficiënt voor ontstoffing.

Er moet voor worden gezorgd dat deze emissiebeperkende technieken geen andere milieuproblemen veroorzaken. De keuze van een bepaald proces op grond van de geringe emissie in de lucht moet worden vermeden indien daardoor het totale milieu-effect van de lozing van zware metalen wordt verergerd, bijvoorbeeld sterkere waterverontreiniging door het lozen van zware metalen als vloeibaar afval. De bestemming van het stof dat wordt opgevangen dankzij de verbeterde gasreiniging, moet eveneens in aanmerking worden genomen. Een negatief milieueffect ten gevolge van de behandeling van dergelijk afval vermindert de winst die met de afgenomen emissie van processtof en rookgas in de lucht is bereikt.  

### 15  

Emissiebeperkende maatregelen kunnen zowel op procestechnieken als op afgasreiniging worden toegespitst. De twee zijn niet onafhankelijk van elkaar; de keuze van een bepaald proces kan tot uitsluiting van bepaalde gasreinigingsmethoden leiden.  

### 16  

De keuze van een beheersingstechniek is afhankelijk van parameters zoals de concentratie en/of vorming van verontreinigende stoffen in het ruw gas, de gasvolumestroom, de gastemperatuur en andere. De toepassingsgebieden kunnen bijgevolg elkaar overlappen; in dat geval moet de meest geschikte techniek worden geselecteerd op basis van de specifieke omstandigheden.  

### 17  

Hieronder zijn adequate maatregelen ter beperking van rookgasemissie in verschillende sectoren beschreven. Er moet rekening worden gehouden met diffuse emissies. Stofemissiebeperking bij het lossen, de behandeling en de opslag van grondstoffen of bijproducten, hoewel niet relevant voor transport over lange afstand, kan voor het plaatselijke milieu belangrijk zijn. De emissie kan worden verminderd door deze activiteiten over te brengen naar volledig gesloten gebouwen, die kunnen worden voorzien van ventilatie- en ontstoffingsinrichtingen, sproeisystemen of andere geschikte beheersingsmiddelen. Bij opslag in niet-overdekte ruimten moet het materiaaloppervlak op een andere wijze tegen de wind worden beschermd. Opslagterreinen en -wegen moeten schoon worden gehouden.  

### 18  

De cijfers in de tabellen betreffende investeringen en kosten komen uit verschillende bronnen en zijn zeer specifiek voor elk afzonderlijk geval. Zij zijn uitgedrukt in USD van 1990 (1 USD (1990) = 0,8 ecu (1990)) en afhankelijk van factoren zoals capaciteit van de installatie, reinigingsrendement, ruwgasconcentratie, type technologie en de keuze tussen nieuwe installaties of aanpassing van bestaande installaties.  

### IV  

####SECTOREN

### 19  

Dit hoofdstuk bevat een tabel per betrokken sector met de voornaamste emissiebronnen, emissiebeperkende maatregelen op basis van de beste beschikbare technieken, de specifieke rendementen inzake beperking en de daaraan verbonden kosten, voor zover beschikbaar. Tenzij anders vermeld, hebben de in de tabellen opgegeven vangstrendementen betrekking op rechtstreekse rookgasemissie.  

#### *Het stoken van fossiele brandstoffen in elektriciteitscentrales en industriële ketels (bijlage II, categorie 1)* 

### 20  

Het stoken van steenkool in elektriciteitscentrales en industriële ketels is een belangrijke bron van antropogene kwikemissie. Het gehalte aan zware metalen in steenkool is gewoonlijk verschillende orden van grootte hoger dan in olie of aardgas.  

### 21  

Betere omzettingsrendementen en maatregelen voor energiebesparing moeten resulteren in minder emissie van zware metalen, aangezien minder brandstof is vereist. Het stoken van aardgas of alternatieve brandstoffen met een laag gehalte aan zware metalen in plaats van steenkool zou eveneens leiden tot een duidelijke vermindering in de emissie van zware metalen zoals kwik. De technologie van warmtekrachtcentrales met geïntegreerde vergassing is een nieuwe technologie met geringe emissie.  

### 22  

Met uitzondering van kwik worden zware metalen uitgeworpen in vaste vorm gebonden aan vliegasdeeltjes. Verschillende kolenstooktechnologieën leveren verschillende hoeveelheden vliegas op: roosterketels 20-40%; wervelbedverbranding 15%; droge ketels (met poederkool gestookt) 70-100% van de totale as. Het gehalte aan zware metalen in de kleine-deeltjesfractie van de vliegas blijkt hoger te zijn.  

### 23  

Voorbehandeling, bijvoorbeeld „wassen" of „bio-behandeling", van steenkool vermindert het gehalte aan zware metalen die aan anorganische materie in de steenkool zijn gebonden. De mate waarin zware metalen met behulp van deze technologie worden verwijderd, loopt evenwel sterk uiteen.  

### 24  

Met behulp van elektrostatische stoffilters (ESP) of doekfilters (DF) kan een totale stofverwijdering van meer dan 99,5% worden verkregen, waarbij in veel gevallen stofconcentraties van ongeveer 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup> worden bereikt. Met uitzondering van kwik kunnen emissies van zware metalen met ten minste 90–99% worden verminderd, waarbij het laagste cijfer geldt voor de meer diffuse elementen. Lage filtertemperatuur draagt bij tot het verminderen van het gehalte aan gasvormig kwik in rookgassen.  

### 25  

De toepassing van technieken ter vermindering van emissies van stikstofoxiden, zwaveldioxide en deeltjes uit rookgassen kan eveneens zware metalen verwijderen. Mogelijke effecten op andere media moeten worden vermeden door behandeling van het afvalwater.  

### 26  

Zoals uit tabel 3 blijkt vertoont het rendement van de kwikverwijdering, bij toepassing van de hierboven vermelde technieken, van installatie tot installatie aanzienlijke verschillen. Er wordt volop onderzoek verricht met het oog op de ontwikkeling van kwikverwijderingstechnieken, maar zolang dergelijke technieken niet op industriële schaal beschikbaar zijn, kan speciaal voor kwikverwijdering geen beste beschikbare techniek worden aangewezen. 
### *Tabel 3: Emissiebeperkende maatregelen, vangstrendement van de emissies door het stoken van fossiele brandstoffen* 

|  *Emissiebron*   |  *Emissiebeperkende maatregel(en)*   |  *Vangstrendement (%)*   |  *Bestrijdingskosten*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Verbranden van stookolie  | Van stookolie op gas overschakelen  | Cd, Pb: 100;  Hg: 70–80  | Sterk afhankelijk van het geval  |

#### *Primaire ijzer- en staalindustrie (bijlage II, categorie 2)* 

### 27  

Dit deel heeft betrekking op emissies uit sinterfabrieken, pelletfabrieken, hoogovens en staalfabrieken met een oxystaaloven. Emissies van Cd, Pb en Hg komen voor in combinatie met deeltjes. Het gehalte aan deze zware metalen in het uitgestoten stof is afhankelijk van de samenstelling van de grondstoffen en de soorten legeringsmetalen die bij de staalproductie worden toegevoegd. Tabel 4 bevat een overzicht van de meest relevante maatregelen voor emissiebeperking. Er moet zoveel mogelijk gebruik worden gemaakt van doekfilters; indien de omstandigheden dat niet toelaten kunnen elektrostatische stoffilters en/of hoogrendementswassers worden gebruikt.  

### 28  

Bij toepassing van de BBT in de primaire ijzer- en staalindustrie kan de totale specifieke stofemissie die rechtstreeks met het proces samenhangt, tot de volgende niveaus worden verminderd:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Sinterfabrieken  | 40 – 120 g/Mg  |
| Pelletfabrieken  | 40 g/Mg  |
| Hoogovens  | 35 – 50 g/Mg  |
| Oxystaalovens  | 35 – 70 g/Mg.  |

### 29  

Reiniging van gassen met gebruikmaking van doekfilters vermindert het stofgehalte tot minder dan 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>, terwijl elektrostatische stoffilters en wassers het stofgehalte tot 50 mg/m <sup>3</sup> verlagen (uurgemiddelde). Er zijn echter talrijke toepassingen van doekfilters in de primaire ijzer- en staalindustrie die veel lagere waarden kunnen bereiken. 
### *Tabel 4: Emissiebronnen, emissiebeperkende maatregelen, rendement van de stofvermindering voor de primaire ijzer- en staalindustrie*

| Diffuse emissies  | Gesloten transportbanden, omhulling, bevochtiging van opgeslagen basismaterialen, schoonmaken van wegen  | 80–99  | ..  |

### 30  

Directe reductie en directe smelting zijn in ontwikkeling en kunnen de behoefte aan sinterfabrieken en hoogovens in de toekomst doen afnemen. De toepassing van deze technologieën is afhankelijk van de ertseigenschappen en het resulterende product moet worden verwerkt in een vlamboogoven, die van de geëigende emissiebeperkende maatregelen moet zijn voorzien.  

#### *Secundaire ijzer- en staalindustrie (bijlage II, categorie 3)* 

### 31  

Het is zeer belangrijk alle emissies op efficiënte wijze op te vangen. Dat is mogelijk door het overkappen van de installatie of het installeren van verstelbare kappen of een dampafzuigsysteem voor het gehele gebouw. De opgevangen emissies moeten worden gereinigd. Voor alle stofuitstotende processen in de secundaire ijzer- en staalindustrie moet ontstoffing met doekfilters, die het stofgehalte tot minder dan 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup> terugdringt, als BBT worden beschouwd. Wanneer de BBT tevens wordt gebruikt voor het minimaliseren van diffuse emissies, zal de specifieke stofemissie (inclusief diffuse emissies die rechtstreeks met het proces samenhangen) niet buiten een bandbreedte van 0,1 tot 0,35 kg/Mg staal vallen. Er zijn talrijke voorbeelden van schoon gas met een stofgehalte van minder dan 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> bij gebruik van doekfilters. De specifieke stofemissies in dergelijke gevallen is normaliter lager dan 0,1 kg/Mg.  

### 32  

Voor het smelten van schroot worden twee verschillende soorten ovens gebruikt: martinovens en vlamboogovens, waarbij steeds minder gebruik wordt gemaakt van martinovens.  

### 33  

Het gehalte aan de vermelde zware metalen in het uitgeworpen stof is afhankelijk van de samenstelling van het ijzer- en staalschroot en de soorten legeringsmetalen die bij de staalproductie worden toegevoegd. Metingen bij vlamboogovens tonen aan dat 95% van het uitgestoten kwik en 25% van de cadmiumemissie in dampvorm voorkomen. Tabel 5 bevat een overzicht van de meest relevante maatregelen ter beperking van de stofemissie. 
### *Tabel 5: Emissiebronnen, emissiebeperkende maatregelen, rendement van de stofvermindering voor de secundaire ijzer- en staalindustrie* 

|  *Emissiebron*   |  *Emissiebeperkende maatregel(en)*   |  *Rendement van de stofvermindering (%)*   |  *Bestrijdingskosten (totale kosten USD)*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Vlamboogoven  | ESP  | > 99  | ..  |
| --- | DF  | > 99.5  | DF: 24/Mg staal  |

#### *IJzergieterijen (bijlage II, categorie 4)* 

### 34  

Het is zeer belangrijk alle emissies op efficiënte wijze op te vangen. Dat is mogelijk door het overkappen van de installatie of het installeren van verstelbare kappen of een dampafzuigsysteem voor het gehele gebouw. De opgevangen emissies moeten worden gereinigd. In ijzergieterijen wordt gebruik gemaakt van koepelovens, vlamboogovens en inductieovens. Directe emissie van deeltjes en gasvormige zware metalen doet zich voornamelijk voor bij het smelten en soms, in geringe mate, bij het gieten. Diffuse emissies komen voor bij het behandelen van grondstoffen, smelten, gieten en afbramen. De meest relevante maatregelen voor emissievermindering zijn in tabel 6 weergegeven met het haalbare rendement inzake vermindering voor zover beschikbaar. Deze maatregelen kunnen stofconcentraties tot 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup> of minder terugdringen.  

### 35  

Onder ijzergieterijen valt een zeer uiteenlopende waaier van installaties. Voor bestaande kleinere installaties is het mogelijk dat de vermelde maatregelen niet de BBT zijn, indien zij niet economisch verantwoord zijn. 
### *Tabel 6: Emissiebronnen, emissiebeperkende maatregelen, rendement van de stofvermindering voor ijzergieterijen* 

|  *Emissiebron*   |  *Emissiebeperkende maatregel(en)*   |  *Rendement van de stofvermindering (%)*   |  *Bestrijdingskosten (totale kosten USD)*   |

| --- | Desintegrator/venturiwasser  | > 97  | ..  |

#### *Primaire en secundaire non-ferro metaalindustrie (bijlage II, categorieën 5 en 6)* 

### 36  

Dit deel heeft betrekking op emissie en emissiebeperking van Cd, Pb en Hg bij de primaire en secundaire productie van non-ferrometalen zoals lood, koper, zink, tin en nikkel. Gezien het grote aantal verschillende grondstoffen die worden gebruikt en de talrijke processen die worden toegepast kunnen vrijwel alle soorten zware metalen en verbindingen daarvan door deze sector worden uitgestoten. In verband met de zware metalen waar het in deze bijlage over gaat is vooral de productie van koper, lood en zink hier van belang.  

### 37  

Kwikertsen en concentraten worden bij de verwerking in een eerste fase gebroken en soms gezeefd. Ertsverrijkingstechnieken worden niet algemeen toegepast, hoewel sommige inrichtingen die laagwaardig erts verwerken gebruik maken van flotatie. Het gebroken erts wordt vervolgens verhit in retorten, bij kleine installaties, of ovens, bij grote installaties, tot de temperatuur waarbij kwiksulfide sublimeert. De resulterende kwikdamp wordt gecondenseerd in een koelsysteem en als kwikmetaal opgevangen. Roet uit de condensoren en bezinktanks moet worden verwijderd en na behandeling met kalk naar de retort of de oven teruggaan.  

### 38  

Voor efficiënte terugwinning van kwik kunnen de volgende technieken worden toegepast: 

– Maatregelen ter vermindering van stofontwikkeling bij het ontginnen en opslaan, waarbij ernaar wordt gestreefd de voorraden zo klein mogelijk te houden;  

– Indirecte verhitting van de oven;  

– Het erts zo droog mogelijk houden;  

– De gastemperatuur bij de inlaat van de condensor niet hoger laten stijgen dan 10 tot 20°C boven het dauwpunt;  

– De uitlaattemperatuur zo laag mogelijk houden;  

– Reactiegassen door een wasser na condensatie en/of een seleniumfilter sturen.   Stofvorming kan worden tegengegaan door indirecte verhitting, afzonderlijke verwerking van fijnkorrelige ertssoorten en beheersing van het ertswatergehalte. Voordat het in de kwikcondensatie-eenheid gaat moet het hete reactiegas worden ontstoft met behulp van cyclonen en/of elektrostatische stoffilters.  

### 39  

Voor goudproductie door middel van amalgamatie kunnen soortgelijke strategieën als bij kwik worden toegepast. Goud wordt eveneens geproduceerd met behulp van andere technieken dan amalgamatie en voor nieuwe installaties moet daar dan ook de voorkeur aan worden gegeven.  

### 40  

Non-ferrometalen worden voornamelijk geproduceerd uit zwavelhoudende ertsen. Om redenen van techniek en productkwaliteit moet het afvoergas grondig worden ontstoft (< 3 mg/m <sup>3</sup>) en moet er eventueel nog kwik uit worden verwijderd voordat het aan een SO <sub>3</sub> -contactinstallatie wordt toegevoerd, waardoor tevens de emissie van zware metalen tot een minimum wordt beperkt.  

### 41  

Wanneer dat mogelijk is moet gebruik worden gemaakt van doekfilters. Er kan een stofgehalte van minder dan 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> worden verkregen. Het stof van alle pyrometallurgische productie moet binnen het bedrijf of elders worden gerecycled, zonder de gezondheid van de werknemers in gevaar te brengen.  

### 42  

Voor primaire loodproductie blijkt uit de eerste ervaringen dat er interessante nieuwe directe smeltreductietechnologieën zijn zonder sintering van de concentraten. Deze processen zijn voorbeelden van een nieuwe generatie van directe autogene loodsmelttechnologieën die minder verontreinigen en minder energie verbruiken.  

### 43  

Secundair lood wordt voornamelijk gewonnen uit gebruikte voertuigaccu's, die uit elkaar worden gehaald voordat zij in de smeltoven worden geladen. Deze BBT moet één smeltbewerking in een korte draaitrommeloven of schachtoven omvatten. Zuurstof-brandstofbranders kunnen het volume afgas en de productie van vliegas met 60% verminderen. Rookgasreiniging met doekfilters maakt stofconcentratieniveaus van 5 mg/m <sup>3</sup> mogelijk.  

### 44  

Primaire zinkproductie vindt plaats met behulp van roost-loog elektrowintechnologie. Uitloging onder druk kan een alternatief vormen voor het roosten en kan worden beschouwd als een BBT voor nieuwe installaties, afhankelijk van de eigenschappen van het concentraat. Emissies van pyrometallurgische zinkproductie in Imperial Smelting (IS)-ovens kunnen tot een minimum worden beperkt door gebruikmaking van een dubbele klokoventop en reiniging met behulp van efficiënte wassers, efficiënte afvoer en reiniging van de gassen van de slakken en het loodgieten alsook grondige reiniging (< 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>) van de CO-rijke ovengassen.  

### 45  

Voor het terugwinnen van zink uit geoxideerde residuen worden deze in een IS-oven bewerkt. Zeer laagwaardige residuen en vliegas (bijvoorbeeld van de staalindustrie) worden eerst behandeld in draaitrommelovens (Waelz-ovens) waarin een hoogwaardig zinkoxide is vervaardigd. Metaalhoudende materialen worden gerecycled door smelten in een inductieoven of een oven met directe of indirecte verhitting door aardgas of vloeibare brandstoffen dan wel in een verticale New Jersey retort, waarin een groot aantal soorten van oxidisch en metallisch secundair materiaal kan worden gerecycled. Zink kan eveneens worden teruggewonnen uit loodovenslakken door middel van afroking.

### 46  

In het algemeen moeten processen worden gecombineerd met een efficiënte stoffilter voor primaire gassen en diffuse emissies. De meest relevante emissiebeperkende maatregelen zijn weergegeven in de tabellen 7 (a) en (b). In bepaalde gevallen zijn met doekfilters stofconcentraties van minder dan 5 mg/m <sup>3</sup> bereikt.  

#### *Cementindustrie (bijlage II, categorie 7)* 

### 47  

Cementovens gebruiken ook wel secundaire brandstoffen zoals afvalolie of oude banden. Wanneer gebruik wordt gemaakt van afval, kunnen de emissievoorschriften voor afvalverbrandingsprocessen van toepassing zijn en wanneer gevaarlijk afval wordt gebruikt, kunnen, afhankelijk van de in de installatie gebruikte hoeveelheid, de emissievoorschriften voor verbrandingsprocessen van gevaarlijk afval van toepassing zijn. Dit deel heeft echter betrekking op met fossiele brandstoffen gestookte ovens.  

### 48  

Deeltjes worden uitgestoten in alle stadia van het cementproductieproces, dat bestaat uit materiaalbehandeling, voorbereiding van de grondstoffen (brekers, drogers), klinkerproductie en cementbereiding. Zware metalen worden met de grondstoffen, fossiele en afvalbrandstoffen in de cementoven gebracht.  

### 49  

Voor klinkerproductie zijn de volgende oventypen beschikbaar: lange natte draaitrommeloven, lange droge draaitrommeloven, draaitrommeloven met cycloonvoorverwarmer, draaitrommeloven met roostervoorverhitter en schachtoven. Uit een oogpunt van energieverbruik en mogelijkheden voor emissiebeperking moet de voorkeur worden gegeven aan draaitrommelovens met cycloonvoorverwarmer.  

### 50  

Voor warmteterugwinning wordt het afvoergas van de draaitrommeloven door het voorverwarmingssysteem en de drogers (voor zover aanwezig) geleid, voordat het wordt ontstoft. Het opgevangen stof wordt naar het basismateriaal teruggevoerd.  

### 51  

Minder dan 0,5% van het lood en het cadmium dat in de oven wordt gevoerd, komt vrij in de uitlaatgassen. Het hoge alkaligehalte en de processen in de oven zorgen ervoor dat het metaal wordt gebonden in het klinker- of ovenstof.  

### 52  

Emissie van zware metalen in de lucht kan worden teruggedrongen door bijvoorbeeld een ontluchtingsstroom af te voeren en het opgevangen stof op te slaan in plaats van het naar het basismateriaal terug te voeren. In elk geval moeten deze overwegingen worden afgewogen tegen de gevolgen van het storten van de zware metalen op de afvalhoop. Een andere mogelijkheid is het aftappen van het ruwe meel, waarbij een deel van het gecalcineerde ruwe meel vlak voor de oveningang wordt afgetapt en aan de cementbereidingsinstallatie wordt toegevoerd. Het stof kan ook aan de klinker worden toegevoegd. Een andere belangrijke maatregel is een zeer goed geregeld gelijkmatig ovenbedrijf teneinde noodonderbrekingen van de elektrostatische stoffilters te vermijden. Deze kunnen worden veroorzaakt door te hoge CO-concentraties. Het is belangrijk dat bij dergelijke noodonderbrekingen hoge pieken in de emissie van zware metalen worden vermeden.  

### 53  

Tabel 8 bevat een overzicht van de meest relevante emissiebeperkende maatregelen. Voor het terugdringen van directe stofemissie uit brekers, molens en drogers worden voornamelijk doekfilters gebruikt, terwijl uit de oven en van de klinkerkoeling afkomstige afgassen met behulp van elektrostatische stoffilters worden behandeld. Met ESP kan het stof worden beperkt tot concentraties van minder dan 50 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. Bij gebruik van DF kan het stofgehalte in het gereinigde gas worden verminderd tot 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. 
### *Tabel 8: Emissiebronnen, emissiebeperkende maatregelen, vangstrendement voor de cementindustrie* 

|  *Emissiebron*   |  *Emissiebeperkende maatregel(en)*   |  *Rendementvan de stofvermindering (%)*   |  *Bestrijdingskosten (totale kosten)*   |

| Directe emissie van roterende ovens  | Kooladsorptie  | Hg: > 95  | ..  |

#### *Glasindustrie (bijlage II, categorie 8)* 

### 54  

In de glasindustrie zijn loodemissies bijzonder belangrijk gezien de verschillende soorten glas waarin lood als grondstof voorkomt (bijvoorbeeld kristalglas, kathodestraalbuizen). Bij verpakkingsglas van natriumkalksilicaat is de loodemissie afhankelijk van de kwaliteit van het gerecycleerde glas dat in het proces wordt gebruikt. Het loodgehalte in stof dat van het smelten van kristalglas afkomstig is, bedraagt gewoonlijk circa 20–60%.  

### 55  

Stofemissies zijn voornamelijk afkomstig van de bereiding van het mengsel, ovens, diffuse lekkage uit ovenopeningen en het polijsten en stralen van glasproducten. Zij zijn met name afhankelijk van de gebruikte brandstof, het oventype en het geproduceerde glastype. „Oxy-fuel branders" kunnen het afgasvolume en de productie van rookgas met 60% verminderen. Bij elektrische verhitting is de loodemissie aanzienlijk lager dan bij het stoken met olie of gas.  

### 56  

Het mengsel wordt gesmolten in continue ovens, dagovens of kroezen. Tijdens de smeltcyclus waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van niet-continue ovens, varieert de stofemissie aanzienlijk. Stofemissies van kristalglasovens (<5 kg/Mg gesmolten glas) zijn groter dan van andere ovens (<1 kg/Mg gesmolten natron- en kaliglas).  

### 57  

Enkele maatregelen ter beperking van directe metaalhoudende stofemissies zijn: pelletiseren van het glasmengsel, overschakeling van olie of gas op elektrische verwarming, het aandeel van retourglas in het mengsel vergroten en een betere selectie van grondstoffen (grootte- distributie) en gerecycleerd glas (vermijden van loodhoudende fracties). Uitlaatgassen kunnen in doekfilters worden gereinigd, waarbij de emissie wordt teruggedrongen tot minder dan 10 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. Met elektrostatische stoffilters wordt 30 mg/m <sup>3</sup> bereikt. Tabel 9 bevat een overzicht van het rendement inzake emissievermindering van de verschillende maatregelen.  

### 58  

Momenteel wordt kristalglas zonder loodverbindingen ontwikkeld.

#### *Chloor-alkali-industrie (bijlage II, categorie 9)* 

### 59  

In de chloor-alkali-industrie worden, Cl <sub>2</sub>, natronloog en waterstof geproduceerd door middel van elektrolyse van een zoutoplossing. Het kwikproces en diafragmaproces worden veel gebruikt in bestaande fabrieken, waarbij een optimale bedrijfsvoering moet worden gehanteerd om milieuproblemen te voorkomen. Het membraanproces leidt niet tot directe kwikemissie. Bovendien blijkt de elektrolyse-energie lager te zijn en zijn er hogere temperaturen vereist voor de concentratie van natronloog (de totale energiebalans levert een licht voordeel voor membraanceltechnologie op in de orde van 10 tot 15%), terwijl met compactere cellen kan worden gewerkt. Deze technologie wordt derhalve als de te verkiezen optie voor nieuwe installaties beschouwd. Besluit 90/3 van 14 juni 1990 van de Commissie voor de voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee vanaf het land (PARCOM) beveelt aan bestaande chloor-alkali-installaties met kwikcellen zo spoedig mogelijk te vervangen en wel zodanig dat er in 2010 geen meer zijn.  

### 60  

De specifieke investering voor de vervanging van kwikcellen door het membraanproces wordt geraamd op 700 tot 1.000 USD/Mg Cl <sub>2</sub> -capaciteit. Hoewel extra kosten kunnen voortvloeien uit onder andere hogere utiliteitskosten en pekelzuiveringskosten, zullen de bedrijfskosten in de meeste gevallen afnemen, vooral dankzij besparingen door minder energieverbruik en lagere kosten van afvalwaterbehandeling en afvalverwijdering.  

### 61  

De bronnen van kwikemissies in het milieu bij het kwikproces zijn: cellenzaalventilatie, procesuitstoot; producten, met name waterstof, en afvalwater. Wat de emissie in de lucht betreft is vooral het diffuus uit de cellen naar de cellenzaal geëmitteerde Hg van betekenis. Preventieve maatregelen en beheersing zijn van groot belang en daaraan moet naar gelang van het relatieve belang van elke bron in een bepaalde installatie prioriteit worden gegeven. In elk geval zijn specifieke emissiebeperkende maatregelen vereist wanneer kwik wordt teruggewonnen uit slib dat van het proces afkomstig is.  

### 62  

De volgende maatregelen kunnen worden genomen om emissies van bestaande kwikprocesinstallaties terug te dringen: 

– Procesregeling en technische maatregelen voor optimale celwerking, onderhoud en efficiëntere bedrijfsmethoden;  

– Afdekking, afdichting en gecontroleerde ontluchting door middel van afzuiging;  

– Reiniging van cellenzaal en maatregelen die het gemakkelijker maken deze schoon te houden;  

– Reiniging van een aantal gasstromen (bepaalde verontreinigde luchtstromen en waterstofgas).    

### 63  

Deze maatregelen kunnen kwikemissies terugdringen tot waarden ver beneden 2,0 g/Mg Cl <sub>2</sub> -productiecapaciteit, uitgedrukt als jaargemiddelde. Er zijn voorbeelden van installaties die tot emissies ver beneden 1,0 g/Mg Cl <sub>2</sub> -productiecapacieit komen. Ingevolge PARCOM-besluit 90/3 dienden bestaande chloor-alkali-installaties die kwik gebruiken, uiterlijk op 31 december 1996 aan een niveau van 2 g Hg/Mg Cl <sub>2</sub> te voldoen voor emissies die onder het verdrag ter voorkoming van verontreiniging van de zee vanaf het land vallen. Aangezien emissies voor een groot gedeelte afhankelijk zijn van goede bedrijfspraktijken, zou het gemiddelde onderhoudsperioden van 1 jaar of minder moeten omvatten en daar ook door moeten worden bepaald.  

#### *Verbranding van stedelijk, medisch en gevaarlijk afval (bijlage II, categorieën 10 en 11)* 

### 64  

Verbranding van stedelijk, medisch en gevaarlijk afval leidt tot emissies van cadmium, lood en kwik. Kwik, een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid cadmium en geringere hoeveelheden lood komen daarbij in de gasfase. Zowel vóór als na de verbranding moeten bepaalde maatregelen worden genomen om deze emissies terug te dringen.  

### 65  

Doekfilters in combinatie met een droge of natte methode ter bestrijding van diffuse stoffen wordt als de beste beschikbare technologie voor ontstoffing beschouwd. Elektrostatische stoffilters in combinatie met natte systemen kunnen eveneens worden ingeschakeld om een lage stofemissie te bereiken, maar zij bieden minder mogelijkheden dan doekfilters, vooral met voorbekleding voor adsorptie van diffuse verontreinigingen.  

### 66  

Wanneer de BBT wordt toegepast voor het reinigen van rookgassen, wordt de stofconcentratie verminderd tot 10 à 20 mg/m <sup>3</sup>; in de praktijk worden lagere concentraties bereikt en in bepaalde gevallen is melding gemaakt van concentraties van minder dan 1 mg/m <sup>3</sup>. De kwikconcentratie kan worden teruggedrongen tot 0,05 à 0,10 mg/m <sup>3</sup> (betrokken op 11% O <sub>2</sub>).  

### 67  

Tabel 10 bevat een overzicht van de meest relevante secundaire emissiebeperkende maatregelen. Het is moeilijk algemeen geldige gegevens te verstrekken, omdat de relatieve kosten in USD/ton afhankelijk zijn van een bijzonder brede waaier van variabelen die specifiek voor de installatie zijn, zoals samenstelling van het afval.  

### 68  

Zware metalen komen voor in alle fracties van de stedelijke afvalstroom (bijvoorbeeld producten, papier, organische materialen). Door de te verbranden hoeveelheid stedelijk afval te verminderen kan dan ook de emissie van zware metalen worden teruggedrongen. Dit kan worden bewerkstelligd door verschillende afvalbeheersstrategieën, waaronder recyclingprogramma's en het composteren van organische materialen. Bovendien staan sommige VN/ECE-landen toe dat stedelijk afval wordt gestort. Op een correct beheerd stortterrein worden emissies van cadmium en lood uitgeschakeld en kunnen kwikemissies lager zijn dan bij verbranding. In verschillende VN/ECE-landen wordt onderzoek verricht naar kwikemissies uit stortterreinen.

### Bijlage  IV  

####Tijdschema voor de toepassing van grenswaarde en beste beschikbare technieken op nieuwe en bestaande stationaire bronnen

Voor de toepassing van grenswaarden en beste beschikbare technieken geldt het volgende tijdschema: 

a. Voor nieuwe stationaire bronnen: twee jaar na de datum waarop dit Protocol van kracht wordt;  

b. Voor bestaande stationaire bronnen: acht jaar na de datum waarop dit Protocol van kracht wordt. Indien nodig kan deze termijn voor bepaalde bestaande stationaire bronnen worden verlengd overeenkomstig de afschrijvingsperiode die in de nationale wetgeving is bepaald.     

### Bijlage  V  

####Grenswaarden voor de beperking van de emissie door belangrijke stationaire bronnen

### I  

####INLEIDING

### 1  

Twee soorten grenswaarden zijn belangrijk voor beheersing van de emissie van zware metalen: 

– Waarden voor specifieke zware metalen of groepen van zware metalen;  

– Waarden voor emissies van stof in het algemeen.    

### 2  

In beginsel kunnen grenswaarden voor stof niet de specifieke grenswaarden voor cadmium, lood en kwik vervangen, omdat de hoeveelheid metalen bij stofvormige emissies van proces tot proces verschilt. Naleving van deze grenswaarden draagt evenwel aanzienlijk bij tot vermindering van de emissie van zware metalen in het algemeen. Controle van stofvormige emissies is gewoonlijk minder duur dan controle van de verschillende soorten en continue controle van afzonderlijke zware metalen is doorgaans niet uitvoerbaar. Grenswaarden voor stof zijn bijgevolg van groot praktisch belang en zijn in deze bijlage in de meeste gevallen vastgesteld als aanvulling of vervanging van specifieke grenswaarden voor cadmium of lood of kwik.  

### 3  

Grenswaarden, uitgedrukt in mg/m <sup>3</sup>, gelden voor standaardcondities (volume bij 273,15 K, 101,3 kPa, droog gas) en worden berekend als een gemiddelde waarde van metingen gedurende één uur over meerdere uren van bedrijf, in de regel 24 uren. Opstart- en onderhoudsperioden worden niet in aanmerking genomen. De middelingstijd kan worden verlengd indien dat nodig is om voldoende nauwkeurige controleresultaten te verkrijgen. Met betrekking tot het zuurstofgehalte van het afgas gelden de waarden die voor geselecteerde belangrijke stationaire bronnen zijn gegeven. Verdunning om de concentraties van verontreinigende stoffen in afgassen te verlagen, is verboden. Grenswaarden voor zware metalen omvatten de vaste, gas- en dampvorm van het metaal en verbindingen daarvan, uitgedrukt als het metaal. Wanneer grenswaarden voor totale emissies zijn gegeven, uitgedrukt in g/eenheid van productie, respectievelijk capaciteit, hebben deze betrekking op het totaal van rookgas- en diffuse emissies, berekend als een gemiddelde waarde.  

### 4  

In gevallen waarin overschrijding van gegeven grenswaarden niet kan worden uitgesloten, moet controle worden uitgeoefend op de emissies dan wel op een prestatie-indicator die aangeeft of een regelsysteem naar behoren functioneert en goed wordt onderhouden. Indien de uitgestoten stof-vracht meer dan 10 kg/h bedraagt moet de controle op emissies of prestatie-indicatoren continu zijn. Indien emissies worden gecontroleerd, moeten de concentraties van luchtverontreinigende stoffen in gasafvoerkanalen op een representatieve wijze worden gemeten. Bij discontinue controle van stofvormige emissies moeten de concentraties op gezette tijdstippen worden gemeten met ten minste drie onafhankelijke registraties per controle. Bemonstering en analyse van alle verontreinigende stoffen alsook referentiemeetmethoden voor het ijken van geautomatiseerde meetsystemen, moeten worden uitgevoerd overeenkomstig de normen die door de Europese Commissie voor Normalisatie (CEN) of de Internationale Organisatie voor Normalisatie (ISO) zijn vastgesteld. In afwachting van de opstelling van de CEN- of ISO-normen, zijn de nationale normen van toepassing. Nationale normen kunnen eveneens worden toegepast indien zij resultaten opleveren die gelijkwaardig zijn met CEN- of ISO-normen.  

### 5  

Bij continue controle wordt geacht aan de grenswaarden te zijn voldaan indien geen van de berekende gemiddelde emissieconcentraties over 24 uren de grenswaarde overschrijdt of indien het 24-uurgemiddelde van de gecontroleerde parameter niet de gecorreleerde waarde overschrijdt van die parameter die tijdens een prestatieproef met een naar behoren functionerend en onderhouden regelsysteem werd vastgesteld. Bij discontinue emissiecontrole wordt geacht aan de grenswaarden te zijn voldaan indien de gemiddelde registratie per controle de grenswaarde niet overschrijdt. Geacht wordt te zijn voldaan aan elk van de grenswaarden, uitgedrukt als totale emissie per eenheid van productie of totale jaarlijkse emissie, indien de gecontroleerde waarde niet wordt overschreden, zoals hierboven beschreven.

### Bijlage  VI  

####Maatregelen inzake productbeheersing

### 1  

Tenzij in deze bijlage anders is bepaald, mag uiterlijk zes maanden na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol het loodgehalte van benzine die voor wegvoertuigen wordt verkocht, niet meer dan 0,013 g/l bedragen. Partijen die ongelode benzine met een loodgehalte van minder dan 0,013 g/l in de handel brengen, trachten dat niveau te behouden of nog te verlagen.  

### 2  

De Partijen streven ernaar dat de overschakeling op brandstoffen met een loodgehalte zoals vermeld in punt 1, resulteert in een algehele vermindering van de schadelijke effecten op de volksgezondheid en het milieu.  

### 3  

Indien een staat bepaalt dat het beperken van het loodgehalte van in de handel gebrachte benzine overeenkomstig punt 1 zou resulteren in ernstige sociaal-economische of technische problemen dan wel alles bij elkaar geen voordelen voor milieu of volksgezondheid zou opleveren, gezien onder andere de klimatologische situatie, kan hij de in dat punt vermelde termijn verlengen tot tien jaar, gedurende welke gelode benzine met een loodgehalte van ten hoogste 0,15 g/l in de handel mag worden gebracht. In dat geval moet de staat in een verklaring, die samen met de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding moet worden nedergelegd, uitdrukkelijk vermelden dat hij voornemens is de termijn te verlengen en het uitvoerend orgaan schriftelijk inlichten over de redenen daarvoor.  

### 4  

Een partij mag geringe hoeveelheden, tot 0,5% van de totale benzineverkoop, gelode benzine met een loodgehalte van ten hoogste 0,15 g/l in de handel brengen die voor oude wegvoertuigen is bestemd.  

### 5  

Elke partij moet uiterlijk vijf jaar, dan wel tien jaar voor landen met een overgangseconomie die in een met hun akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding neder te leggen verklaring te kennen geven een termijn van tien jaar te willen hanteren, concentratieniveaus bereiken die niet hoger zijn dan: 

a. 0,05 gewichtsprocenten kwik in alkali-mangaanbatterijen voor langdurig gebruik in extreme omstandigheden (bijvoorbeeld temperatuur onder 0°C of boven 50°C, blootstelling aan schokken);  

b. 0,025 gewichtsprocenten kwik in alle andere alkali-mangaanbatterijen.   De bovengenoemde grenswaarden mogen worden overschreden bij een nieuwe toepassing van een batterijtechnologie of het gebruik van een batterij in een nieuw product, indien redelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen zijn genomen om ervoor te zorgen dat de batterij of het product zonder een gemakkelijk te verwijderen batterij op een milieuvriendelijke manier wordt verwijderd. Alkali-mangaanknoopcellen en batterijen die uit knoopcellen zijn samengesteld zijn eveneens van deze verplichting vrijgesteld.  

### Bijlage  VII  

####Maatregelen inzake productiebeheer

### 1  

Deze bijlage heeft tot doel Partijen richtsnoeren te verstrekken voor maatregelen inzake productbeheer.  

### 2  

De Partijen kunnen geëigende maatregelen inzake productbeheer zoals de hieronder vermelde in overweging nemen, waar dat gerechtvaardigd is in verband met de potentiële risico's van schadelijke effecten op de volksgezondheid of het milieu van emissies van één of meer van de in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen, rekening houdend met alle relevante risico's en voordelen van dergelijke maatregelen, teneinde ervoor te zorgen dat eventuele wijzigingen in producten in totaal resulteren in een vermindering van schadelijke effecten voor de volksgezondheid en het milieu: 

a. Vervanging van producten waaraan één of meer in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen opzettelijk zijn toegevoegd, indien een geschikt alternatief bestaat;  

b. Minimalisering of vervanging in producten van één of meer in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen die opzettelijk zijn toegevoegd;  

c. Productinformatie met inbegrip van etikettering die de gebruikers inlicht over het feit dat één of meer in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen opzettelijk zijn toegevoegd en over de noodzaak van veilig gebruik en afvalbehandeling;  

d. Economische stimuleringsmaatregelen of vrijwillige overeenkomsten teneinde de aanwezigheid van de in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen te beperken of uit te schakelen;  

e. Uitwerking en implementatie van programma's voor milieuvriendelijke inzameling, recycling of verwijdering van producten die een van de in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen bevatten.    

### 3  

Elk hieronder vermeld product of groep van producten bevat één of meer van de in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen en is door ten minste één partij bij het verdrag onderworpen aan regelgeving of vrijwillige maatregelen, voor een belangrijk gedeelte op basis van de bijdrage van dat product tot emissies van één of meer van de in bijlage I vermelde zware metalen. Er is evenwel nog niet voldoende informatie beschikbaar om te bevestigen dat zij voor alle Partijen een belangrijke bron vormen en dat dus de opname daarvan in bijlage VI gerechtvaardigd is. Elke partij wordt aangemoedigd de beschikbare informatie te onderzoeken en, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat voorzorgsmaatregelen moeten worden getroffen, maatregelen inzake productbeheer, zoals die welke in punt 2 zijn genoemd, toe te passen op een of meer van de hieronder vermelde producten: 

a. Kwikhoudende elektrische componenten, d.w.z. apparaten met één of meer contacten/sensoren voor het overbrengen van elektrische stroom, zoals relais, thermostaten, niveauschakelaars, drukschakelaars en andere schakelaars (reeds getroffen maatregelen omvatten een verbod van de meeste kwikhoudende elektrische componenten, vrijwillige programma's ter vervanging van bepaalde kwikschakelaars door elektrische of speciale schakelaars, vrijwillige recyclingprogramma's voor schakelaars en vrijwillige recyclingprogramma's voor thermostaten);  

b. Kwikhoudende meetmiddelen zoals thermometers, manometers, barometers, drukmeters, drukschakelaars en drukoverbrengers (getroffen maatregelen omvatten een verbod van kwikhoudende thermometers en een verbod van meetinstrumenten);  

c. Kwikhoudende fluorescentielampen (getroffen maatregelen omvatten vermindering van het kwikgehalte per lamp via zowel vrijwillige programma's als regelgeving en vrijwillige recyclingprogramma's);  

d. Kwikhoudend tandamalgaam (getroffen maatregelen omvatten vrijwillige programma's en een verbod met vrijstellingen voor het gebruik van tandamalgaam en vrijwillige programma's ter stimulering van het opvangen van tandamalgaam uit de tandartsenpraktijk voordat het naar waterzuiveringsinstallaties wordt geloosd;  

e. Kwikhoudende bestrijdingsmiddelen, met inbegrip van zaadbehandeling (getroffen maatregelen omvatten een verbod van alle kwikhoudende bestrijdingsmiddelen, met inbegrip van zaadbehandeling, en een verbod van het gebruik van kwik als desinfecteermiddel);  

f. Kwikhoudende verf (getroffen maatregelen omvatten een verbod van alle dergelijke verfsoorten, een verbod van die verfsoorten voor gebruik binnenshuis en op kinderspeelgoed alsook een verbod van het gebruik in aangroeiwerende verf);  

g. Andere kwikhoudende batterijen dan de in bijlage VI bedoelde (getroffen maatregelen omvatten vermindering van het kwikgehalte via zowel vrijwillige programma's als regelgeving en milieuheffingen en vrijwillige recyclingprogramma's).    

####Besluit 1998/1 met betrekking tot criteria en procedures voor het toevoegen van zware metalen en producten aan het Protocol inzake zware metalen

De vertaling van het besluit is niet beschikbaar.
