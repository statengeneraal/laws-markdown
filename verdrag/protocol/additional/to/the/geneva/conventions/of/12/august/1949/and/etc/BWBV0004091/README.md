##Aanvullend Protocol bij de Verdragen van Genève van 12 augustus 1949, betreffende de bescherming van de slachtoffers van internationale gewapende conflicten (Protocol I)

####Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts (Protocol I)

PREAMBLE The High Contracting Parties, Proclaiming their earnest wish to see peace prevail among peoples, Recalling that every State has the duty, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to refrain in its international relations from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, Believing it necessary nevertheless to reaffirm and develop the provisions protecting the victims of armed conflicts and to supplement measures intended to reinforce their application, Expressing their conviction that nothing in this Protocol or in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 can be construed as legitimizing or authorizing any act of aggression or any other use of force inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming further that the provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and of this Protocol must be fully applied in all circumstances to all persons who are protected by those instruments, without any adverse distinction based on the nature or origin of the armed conflict or on the causes espoused by or attributed to the Parties to the conflict,   Have agreed on the following:

### Article  4  

####Legal status of the Parties of the conflict

The application of the Conventions and of this Protocol, as well as the conclusion of the agreements provided for therein, shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict. Neither the occupation of a territory nor the application of the Convention and this Protocol shall affect the legal status of the territory in question.  

### Article  5  

####Appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute

1.  It is the duty of the Parties to a conflict from the beginning of that conflict to secure the supervision and implementation of the Conventions and of this Protocol by the application of the system of Protecting Powers, including *inter alia* the designation and acceptance of those Powers, in accordance with the following paragraphs. Protecting Powers shall have the duty of safeguarding the interests of the Parties to the conflict.   
2.  From the beginning of a situation referred to in Article 1, each Party to the conflict shall without delay designate a Protecting Power for the purpose of applying the Conventions and this Protocol and shall, likewise without delay and for the same purpose, permit the activities of a Protecting Power which has been accepted by it as such after designation by the adverse Party.   
3.  If a Protecting Power has not been designated or accepted from the beginning of a situation referred to in Article 1, the International Committee of the Red Cross, without prejudice to the right of any other impartial humanitarian organization to do likewise, shall offer its goods offices to the Parties to the conflict with a view to the designation without delay of a Protecting Power to which the Parties to the conflict consent. For that purpose it may, *inter alia,* ask each Party to provide it with a list of at least five States which that Party considers acceptable to act as Protecting Power on its behalf in relation to an adverse Party, and ask each adverse Party to provide a list of at least five States which it would accept as the Protecting Power of the first Party; these lists shall be communicated to the Committee within two weeks after the receipt of the request; it shall compare them and seek the agreement of any proposed State named on both lists.   
4.  If, despite the foregoing, there is no Protecting Power, the Parties to the conflict shall accept without delay an offer which may be made by the International Committee of the Red Cross or by any other organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy, after due consultations with the said Parties and taking into account the result of these consultations, to act as a substitute. The functioning of such a substitute is subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict; every effort shall be made by the Parties to the conflict to facilitate the operations of the substitute in the performance of its tasks under the Conventions and this Protocol.   
5.  In accordance with Article 4, the designation and acceptance of Protecting Powers for the purpose of applying the Conventions and this Protocol shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict or of any territory, including occupied territory.   
6.  The maintenance of diplomatic relations between Parties to the conflict or the entrusting of the protection of a Party's interests and those of its nationals to a third State in accordance with the rules of international law relating to diplomatic relations is no obstacle to the designation of Protecting Powers for the purpose of applying the Conventions and this Protocol.   
7.  Any subsequent mention in this Protocol of a Protecting Power includes also a substitute.   

### Article  6  

####Qualified persons

1.  The High Contracting Parties shall, also in peacetime, endeavour, with the assistance of the national Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies, to train qualified personnel to facilitate the application of the Conventions and of this Protocol, and in particular the activities of the Protecting Powers.   
2.  The recruitment and training of such personnel are within domestic jurisdiction.   
3.  The International Committee of the Red Cross shall hold at the disposal of the High Contracting Parties the lists of persons so trained which the High Contracting Parties may have established and may have transmitted to it for that purpose.   
4.  The conditions governing the employment of such personnel outside the national territory shall, in each case, be the subject of special agreements between the Parties concerned.   

### Article  7  

####Meetings

The depositary of this Protocol shall convene a meeting of the High Contracting Parties, at the request of one or more of the said Parties and upon the approval of the majority of the said Parties, to consider general problems concerning the application of the Conventions and of the Protocol.

### Article  11  

####Protection of persons

1.  The physical or mental health and integrity of persons who are in the power of the adverse Party or who are interned, detained or otherwise deprived of liberty as a result of a situation referred to in Article 1 shall not be endangered by any unjustified act or omission. Accordingly, it is prohibited to subject the persons described in this Article to any medical procedure which is not indicated by the state of health of the person concerned and which is not consistent with generally accepted medical standards which would be applied under similar medical circumstances to persons who are nationals of the Party conducting the procedure and who are in no way deprived of liberty.   
2.  It is, in particular, prohibited to carry out on such persons, even with their consent: 

(a) physical mutilations;  

(b) medical or scientific experiments;  

(c) removal of tissue or organs for transplantation,   except where these acts are justified in conformity with the conditions provided for in paragraph 1.   
3.  Exceptions to the prohibition in paragraph 2 (c) may be made only in the case of donations of blood for transfusion or of skin for grafting, provided that they are given voluntarily and without any coercion or inducement, and then only for therapeutic purposes, under conditions consistent with generally accepted medical standards and controls designed for the benefit of both the donor and the recipient.   
4.  Any wilful act or omission which seriously endangers the physical or mental health or integrity of any person who is in the power of a Party other than the one on which he depends and which either violates any of the prohibitions in paragraphs 1 and 2 or fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph 3 shall be a grave breach of this Protocol.   
5.  The persons described in paragraph 1 have the right to refuse any surgical operation. In case of refusal, medical personnel shall endeavour to obtain a written statement to that effect, signed or acknowledged by the patient.   
6.  Each Party to the conflict shall keep a medical record for every donation of blood for transfusion or skin for grafting by persons referred to in paragraph 1, if that donation is made under the responsibility of that Party. In addition, each Party to the conflict shall endeavour to keep a record of all medical procedures undertaken with respect to any person who is interned, detained or otherwise deprived of liberty as a result of a situation referred to in Article 1. These records shall be available at all times for inspection by the Protecting Power.   

### Article  12  

####Protection of medical units

1.  Medical units shall be respected and protected at all times and shall not be the object of attack.   
2.  Paragraph 1 shall apply to civilian medical units, provided that they: 

(a) belong to one of the Parties to the conflict;  

(b) are recognized and authorized by the competent authority of one of the Parties to the conflict; or  

(c) are authorized in conformity with Article 9, paragraph 2, of this Protocol or Article 27 of the First Convention.     
3.  The Parties to the conflict are invited to notify each other of the location of their fixed medical units. The absence of such notification shall not exempt any of the Parties from the obligation to comply with the provisions of paragraph 1.   
4.  Under no circumstances shall medical units be used in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack. Whenever possible, the Parties to the conflict shall ensure that medical units are so sited that attacks against military objectives do not imperil their safety.   

### Article  13  

####Discontinuance of protection of civilian medical units

1.  The protection to which civilian medical units are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded.   
2.  The following shall not be considered as acts harmful to the enemy: 

(a) that the personnel of the unit are equipped with light individual weapons for their own defence or for that of the wounded and sick in their charge;  

(b) that the unit is guarded by a picket or by sentries or by an escort;  

(c) that small-arms and ammunition taken from the wounded and sick, and not yet handed to the proper service, are found in the units;  

(d) that members of the armed forces or other combatants are in the unit for medical reasons.     

### Article  14  

####Limitations on requisition of civilian medical units

1.  The Occupying Power has the duty to ensure that the medical needs of the civilian population in occupied territory continue to be satisfied.   
2.  The Occupying Power shall not, therefore, requisition civilian medical units, their equipment, their *matériel* or the services of their personnel, so long as these resources are necessary for the provision of adequate medical services for the civilian population and for the continuing medical care of any wounded and sick already under treatment.   
3.  Provided that the general rule in paragraph 2 continues to be observed, the Occupying Power may requisition the said resources, subject to the following particular conditions: 

(a) that the resources are necessary for the adequate and immediate medical treatment of the wounded and sick members of the armed forces of the Occupying Power or of prisoners of war;  

(b) that the requisition continues only while such necessity exists; and  

(c) that immediate arrangements are made to ensure that the medical needs of the civilian population, as well as those of any wounded and sick under treatment who are affected by the requisition, continue to be satisfied.     

### Article  15  

####Protection of civilian medical and religious personnel

1.  Civilian medical personnel shall be respected and protected.   
2.  If needed, all available help shall be afforded to civilian medical personnel in an area where civilian medical services are disrupted by reason of combat activity.   
3.  The Occupying Power shall afford civilian medical personnel in occupied territories every assistance to enable them to perform to the best of their ability, their humanitarian functions. The Occupying Power may not require that, in the performance of those functions, such personnel shall give priority to the treatment of any person except on medical grounds. They shall not be compelled to carry out tasks which are not compatible with their humanitarian mission.   
4.  Civilian medical personnel shall have access to any place where their services are essential, subject to such supervisory and safety measures as the relevant Party to the conflict may deem necessary.   
5.  Civilian religious personnel shall be respected and protected. The provisions of the Conventions and of this Protocol concerning the protection and identification of medical personnel shall apply equally to such persons.   

### Article  16  

####General protection of medical duties

1.  Under no circumstances shall any person be punished for carrying out medical activities compatible with medical ethics, regardless of the person benefiting therefrom.   
2.  Persons engaged in medical activities shall not be compelled to perform acts or to carry out work contrary to the rules of medical ethics or to other medical rules designed for the benefit of the wounded and sick or to the provisions of the Conventions or of this Protocol, or to refrain from performing acts or from carrying out work required by those rules and provisions.   
3.  No person engaged in medical activities shall be compelled to give to anyone belonging either to an adverse Party, or to his own Party except as required by the law of the latter Party, any information concerning the wounded and sick who are, or who have been, under his care, if such information would, in his opinion, prove harmful to the patients concerned or to their families. Regulations for the compulsory notification of communicable diseases shall, however, be respected.   

### Article  17  

####Role of the civilian population and of aid societies

1.  The civilian population shall respect the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, even if they belong to the adverse Party, and shall commit no act of violence against them. The civilian population and aid societies, such as national Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies, shall be permitted, even on their own initiative, to collect and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, even in invaded or occupied areas. No one shall be harmed, prosecuted, convicted or punished for such humanitarian acts.   
2.  The Parties to the conflict may appeal to the civilian population and the aid societies referred to in paragraph 1 to collect and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, and to search for the dead and report their location; they shall grant both protection and the necessary facilities to those who respond to this appeal. If the adverse Party gains or regains control of the area, that Party also shall afford the same protection and facilities for so long as they are needed.   

### Article  18  

####Identification

1.  Each Party to the conflict shall endeavour to ensure that medical and religious personnel and medical units and transports are identifiable.   
2.  Each Party to the conflict shall also endeavour to adopt and to implement methods and procedures which will make it possible to recognize medical units and transports which use the distinctive emblem and distinctive signals.   
3.  In occupied territory and in areas where fighting is taking place or is likely to take place, civilian medical personnel and civilian religious personnel should be recognizable by the distinctive emblem and an identity card certifying their status.   
4.  With the consent of the competent authority, medical units and transports shall be marked by the distinctive emblem. The ships and craft referred to in Article 22 of this Protocol shall be marked in accordance with the provisions of the Second Convention.   
5.  In addition to the distinctive emblem, a Party to the conflict may, as provided in Chapter III of Annex I to this Protocol, authorize the use of distinctive signals to identify medical units and transports. Exceptionally, in the special cases covered in that Chapter, medical transports may use distinctive signals without displaying the distinctive emblem.   
6.  The application of the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article is governed by Chapters I to III of Annex I to this Protocol. Signals designated in Chapter III of the Annex for the exclusive use of medical units and transports shall not, except as provided therein, be used for any purpose other than to identify the medical units and transports specified in that Chapter.   
7.  This Article does not authorize any wider use of the distinctive emblem in peacetime than is prescribed in Article 44 of the First Convention.   
8.  The provisions of the Conventions and of this Protocol relating to supervision of the use of the distinctive emblem and to the prevention and repression of any misuse thereof shall be applicable to distinctive signals.   

### Article  19  

####Neutral and other States not Parties to the conflict

Neutral and other States not Parties to the conflict shall apply the relevant provisions of this Protocol to persons protected by this Part who may be received or interned within their territory, and to any dead of the Parties to that conflict whom they may find.  

### Article  20  

####Prohibition of reprisals

Reprisals against the persons and objects protected by this Part are prohibited.  

### SECTION  II  

####MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION

### Article  21  

####Medical vehicles

Medical vehicles shall be respected and protected in the same way as mobile medical units under the Conventions and this Protocol.  

### Article  22  

####Hospital ships and coastal rescue craft

1.  The provisions of the Conventions relating to: 

(a) vessels described in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 of the Second Convention,  

(b) their lifeboats and small craft,  

(c) their personnel and crews, and  

(d) the wounded, sick and shipwrecked on board,   shall also apply where these vessels carry civilian wounded, sick and shipwrecked who do not belong to any of the categories mentioned in Article 13 of the Second Convention. Such civilians shall not, however, be subject to surrender to any Party which is not their own, or to capture at sea. If they find themselves in the power of a Party to the conflict other than their own they shall be covered by the Fourth Convention and by this Protocol.   
2.  The protection provided by the Conventions to vessels described in Article 25 of the Second Convention shall extend to hospital ships made available for humanitarian purposes to a Party to the conflict: 

(a) by a neutral or other State which is not a Party to that conflict; or  

(b) by an impartial international humanitarian organization,   provided that, in either case, the requirements set out in that Article are complied with.   
3.  Small craft described in Article 27 of the Second Convention shall be protected even if the notification envisaged by that Article has not been made. The Parties to the conflict are, nevertheless, invited to inform each other of any details of such craft which will facilitate their identification and recognition.   

### Article  23  

####Other medical ships and craft

1.  Medical ships and craft other than those referred to in Article 22 of this Protocol and Article 38 of the Second Convention shall, whether at sea or in other waters, be respected and protected in the same way as mobile medical units under the Conventions and this Protocol. Since this protection can only be effective if they can be identified and recognized as medical ships or craft, such vessels should be marked with the distinctive emblem and as far as possible comply with the second paragraph of Article 43 of the Second Convention.   
2.  The ships and craft referred to in paragraph 1 shall remain subject to the laws of war. Any warship on the surface able immediately to enforce its command may order them to stop, order them off, or make them take a certain course, and they shall obey every such command. Such ships and craft may not in any other way be diverted from their medical mission so long as they are needed for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked on board.   
3.  The protection provided in paragraph 1 shall cease only under the conditions set out in Articles 34 and 35 of the Second Convention. A clear refusal to obey a command given in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be an act harmful to the enemy under Article 34 of the Second Convention.   
4.  A Party to the conflict may notify any adverse Party as far in advance of sailing as possible of the name, description, expected time of sailing, course and estimated speed of the medical ship or craft, particularly in the case of ships of over 2,000 gross tons, and may provide any other information which would facilitate identification and recognition. The adverse Party shall acknowledge receipt of such information.   
5.  The provisions of Article 37 of the Second Convention shall apply to medical and religious personnel in such ships and craft.   
6.  The provisions of the Second Convention shall apply to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked belonging to the categories referred to in Article 13 of the Second Convention and in Article 44 of this Protocol who may be on board such medical ships and craft. Wounded, sick and shipwrecked civilians who do not belong to any of the categories mentioned in Article 13 of the Second Convention shall not be subject, at sea, either to surrender to any Party which is not their own, or to removal from such ships or craft; if they find themselves in the power of a Party to the conflict other than their own, they shall be covered by the Fourth Convention and by this Protocol.   

### Article  24  

####Protection of medical aircraft

Medical aircraft shall be respected and protected, subject to the provisions of this Part.  

### Article  25  

####Medical aircraft in areas not controlled by an adverse Party

In and over land areas physically controlled by friendly forces, or in and over sea areas not physically controlled by an adverse Party, the respect and protection of medical aircraft of a Party to the conflict is not dependent on any agreement with an adverse Party. For greater safety, however, a Party to the conflict operating its medical aircraft in these areas may notify the adverse Party, as provided in Article 29, in particular when such aircraft are making flights bringing them within range of surface-to-air weapons systems of the adverse Party.  

### Article  26  

####Medical aircraft in contact or similar zones

1.  In and over those parts of the contact zone which are physically controlled by friendly forces and in and over those areas the physical control of which is not clearly established, protection for medical aircraft can be fully effective only by prior agreement between the competent military authorities of the Parties to the conflict, as provided for in Article 29. Although, in the absence of such an agreement, medical aircraft operate at their own risk, they shall nevertheless be respected after they have been recognized as such.   
2.  “Contact zone” means any area on land where the forward elements of opposing forces are in contact with each other, especially where they are exposed to direct fire from the ground.   

### Article  27  

####Medical aircraft in areas controlled by an adverse Party

1.  The medical aircraft of a Party to the conflict shall continue to be protected while flying over land or sea areas physically controlled by an adverse Party, provided that prior agreement to such flights has been obtained from the competent authority of that adverse Party.   
2.  A medical aircraft which flies over an area physically controlled by an adverse Party without, or in deviation from the terms of, an agreement provided for in paragraph 1, either through navigational error or because of an emergency affecting the safety of the flight, shall make every effort to identify itself and to inform the adverse Party of the circumstances. As soon as such medical aircraft has been recognized by the adverse Party, that Party shall make all reasonable efforts to give the order to land or to alight on water, referred to in Article 30, paragraph 1, or to take other measures to safeguard its own interests, and, in either case, to allow the aircraft time for compliance, before resorting to an attack against the aircraft.   

### Article  28  

####Restrictions on operations of medical aircraft

1.  The Parties to the conflict are prohibited from using their medical aircraft to attempt to acquire any military advantage over an adverse Party. The presence of medical aircraft shall not be used in an attempt to render military objectives immune from attack.   
2.  Medical aircraft shall not be used to collect or transmit intelligence data and shall not carry any equipment intended for such purposes. They are prohibited from carrying any persons or cargo not included within the definition in Article 8, sub-paragraph (f). The carrying on board of the personal effects of the occupants or of equipment intended solely to facilitate navigation, communication or identification shall not be considered as prohibited.   
3.  Medical aircraft shall not carry any armament except smallarms and ammunition taken from the wounded, sick and shipwrecked on board and not yet handed to the proper service, and such light individual weapons as may be necessary to enable the medical personnel on board to defend themselves and the wounded, sick and shipwrecked in their charge.   
4.  While carrying out the flights referred to in Articles 26 and 27, medical aircraft shall not, except by prior agreement with the adverse Party, be used to search for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked.   

### Article  29  

####Notifications and agreements concerning medical aircraft

1.  Notifications under Article 25, or requests for prior agreement under Articles 26, 27, 28 (paragraph 4), or 31 shall state the proposed number of medical aircraft, their flight plans and means of identification, and shall be understood to mean that every flight will be carried out in compliance with Article 28.   
2.  A Party which receives a notification given under Article 25 shall at once acknowledge receipt of such notification.   
3.  A Party which receives a request for prior agreement under Articles 26, 27, 28 (paragraph 4), or 31 shall, as rapidly as possible, notify the requesting Party: 

(a) that the request is agreed to;  

(b) that the request is denied; or  

(c) of reasonable alternative proposals to the request. It may also propose a prohibition or restriction of other flights in the area during the time involved. If the Party which submitted the request accepts the alternative proposals, it shall notify the other Party of such acceptance.     
4.  The Parties shall take the necessary measures to ensure that notifications and agreements can be made rapidly,   
5.  The Parties stall also take the necessary measures to disseminate rapidly the substance of any such notifications and agreements to the military units concerned and shall instruct those units regarding the means of identification that will be used by the medical aircraft in question.   

### Article  30  

####Landing and inspection of medical aircraft

1.  Medical aircraft flying over areas which are physically controlled by an adverse Party, or over areas the physical control of which is not clearly established, may be ordered to land or to alight on water, as appropriate, to permit inspection in accordance with the following paragraphs. Medical aircraft shall obey any such order.   
2.  If such an aircraft lands or alights on water, whether ordered to do so or for other reasons, it may be subjected to inspection solely to determine the matters referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4. Any such inspection shall be commenced without delay and shall be conducted expeditiously. The inspecting Party shall not require the wounded and sick to be removed from the aircraft unless their removal is essential for the inspection. That Party shall in any event ensure that the condition of the wounded and sick is not adversely affected by the inspection or by the removal.   
3.  If the inspection discloses that the aircraft: 

(a) is a medical aircraft within the meaning of Article 8, subparagraph (j),  

(b) is not in violation of the conditions prescribed in Article 28, and  

(c) has not flown without or in breach of a prior agreement where such agreement is required,   the aircraft and those of its occupants who belong to the adverse Party or to a neutral or other State not a Party to the conflict shall be authorized to continue the flight without delay.   
4.  If the inspection discloses that the aircraft: 

(a) is not a medical aircraft within the meaning of Article 8, subparagraph (j),  

(b) is in violation of the conditions prescribed in Article 28, or  

(c) has flown without or in breach of a prior agreement where such agreement is required,   the aircraft may be seized. Its occupants shall be treated in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Conventions and of this Protocol. Any aircraft seized which had been assigned as a permanent medical aircraft may be used thereafter only as a medical aircraft.   

### Article  31  

####Neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict

1.  Except by prior agreement, medical aircraft shall not fly over or land in the territory of a neutral or other State not a Party to the conflict. However, with such an agreement, they shall be respected throughout their flight and also for the duration of any calls in the territory. Nevertheless they shall obey any summons to land or to alight on water, as appropriate.   
2.  Should a medical aircraft, in the absence of an agreement or in deviation from the terms of an agreement, fly over the territory of a neutral or other State not a Party to the conflict, either through navigational error or because of an emergency affecting the safety of the flight, it shall make every effort to give notice of the flight and to identify itself. As soon as such medical aircraft is recognized, that State shall make all reasonable efforts to give the order to land or to alight on water referred to in Article 30, paragraph 1, or to take other measures to safeguard its own interests, and, in either case, to allow the aircraft time for compliance, before resorting to an attack against the aircraft.   
3.  If a medical aircraft, either by agreement or in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 2, lands or alights on water in the territory of a neutral or other State not Party to the conflict, whether ordered to do so or for other reasons, the aircraft shall be subject to inspection for the purposes of determining whether it is in fact a medical aircraft. The inspection shall be commenced without delay and shall be conducted expeditiously. The inspecting Party shall not require the wounded and sick of the Party operating the aircraft to be removed from it unless their removal is essential for the inspection. The inspecting Party shall in any event ensure that the condition of the wounded and sick is not adversely affected by the inspection or the removal. If the inspection discloses that the aircraft is in fact a medical aircraft, the aircraft with its occupants, other than those who must be detained in accordance with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, shall be allowed to resume its flight, and reasonable facilities shall be given for the continuation of the flight. If the inspection discloses that the aircraft is not a medical aircraft, it shall be seized and the occupants treated in accordance with paragraph 4.   
4.  The wounded, sick and shipwrecked disembarked, otherwise than temporarily, from a medical aircraft with the consent of the local authorities in the territory of a neutral or other State not a Party to the conflict shall, unless agreed otherwise between that State and the Parties to the conflict, be detained by that State where so required by the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, in such a manner that they cannot again take part in the hostilities. The cost of hospital treatment and internment shall be borne by the State to which those persons belong.   
5.  Neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict shall apply any conditions and restrictions on the passage of medical aircraft over, or on the landing of medical aircraft in, their territory equally to all Parties to the conflict.   

### SECTION  III  

####MISSING AND DEAD PERSONS

### Article  32  

####General principle

In the implementation of this Section, the activities of the High Contracting Parties, of the Parties to the conflict and of the international humanitarian organizations mentioned in the Conventions and in this Protocol shall be prompted mainly by the right of families to know the fate of their relatives.  

### Article  33  

####Missing persons

1.  As soon as circumstances permit, and at the latest from the end of active hostilities, each Party to the conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing by an adverse Party. Such adverse Party shall transmit all relevant information concerning such persons in order to facilitate such searches.   
2.  In order to facilitate the gathering of information pursuant to the preceding paragraph, each Party to the conflict shall, with respect to persons who would not receive more favourable consideration under the Conventions and this Protocol: 

(a) record the information specified in Article 138 of the Fourth Convention in respect of such persons who have been detained, imprisoned or otherwise held in captivity for more than two weeks as a result of hostilities or occupation, or who have died during any period of detention;  

(b) to the fullest extent possible, facilitate and, if need be, carry out the search for and the recording of information concerning such persons if they have died in other circumstances as a result of hostilities or occupation.     
3.  Information concerning persons reported missing pursuant to paragraph 1 and requests for such information shall be transmitted either directly or through the Protecting Power or the Central Tracing Agency of the International Committee of the Red Cross or national Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies. Where the information is not transmitted through the International Committee of the Red Cross and its Central Tracing Agency, each Party to the conflict shall ensure that such information is also supplied to the Central Tracing Agency.   
4.  The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to agree on arrangements for teams to search for, identify and recover the dead from battlefield areas, including arrangements, if appropriate, for such teams to be accompanied by personnel of the adverse Party while carrying out these missions in areas controlled by the adverse Party. Personnel of such teams shall be respected and protected while exclusively carrying out these duties.   

### Article  34  

####Remains of deceased

1.  The remains of persons who have died for reasons related to occupation or in detention resulting from occupation or hostilities and those of persons not nationals of the country in which they have died as a result of hostilities shall be respected, and the gravesites of all such persons shall be respected, maintained and marked as provided for in Article 130 of the Fourth Convention, where their remains or gravesites would not receive more favourable consideration under the Conventions and this Protocol.   
2.  As soon as circumstances and the relations between the adverse Parties permit, the High Contracting Parties in whose territories graves and, as the case may be, other locations of the remains of persons who have died as a result of hostilities or during occupation or in detention are situated, shall conclude agreements in order: 

(a) to facilitate access to the gravesites by relatives of the deceased and by representatives of official graves registration services and to regulate the practical arrangements for such access;  

(b) to protect and maintain such gravesites permanently;  

(c) to facilitate the return of the remains of the deceased and of personal effects to the home country upon its request or, unless that country objects, upon the request of the next of kin.     
3.  In the absence of the agreements provided for in paragraph 2 (b) or (c) and if the home country of such deceased is not willing to arrange at its expense for the maintenance of such gravesites, the High Contracting Party in whose territory the gravesites are situated may offer to facilitate the return of the remains of the deceased to the home country. Where such an offer has not been accepted the High Contracting Party may, after the expiry of five years from the date of the offer and upon due notice to the home country, adopt the arrangements laid dawn in its own laws relating to cemeteries and graves.   
4.  A High Contracting Party in whose territory the gravesites referred to in this Article are situated shall be permitted to exhume the remains only: 

(a) in accordance with paragraphs 2 (c) and 3, or  

(b) where exhumation is a matter of overriding public necessity, including cases of medical and investigative necessity, in which case the High Contracting Party shall at all times respect the remains, and shall give notice to the home country of its intention to exhume the remains together with details of the intended place of reinterment.     

### PART  III  

####METHODS AND MEANS OF WARFARE COMBATANT AND PRISONER-OF-WAR STATUS

### SECTION  I  

####METHODS AND MEANS OF WARFARE

### Article  35  

####Basic rules

1.  In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.   
2.  It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.   
3.  It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which, are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.   

### Article  36  

####New weapons

In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.  

### Article  37  

####Prohibition of perfidy

1.  It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy: 

(a) the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;  

(b) the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;  

(c) the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and  

(d) the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.     
2.  Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.   

### Article  38  

####Recognized emblems

1.  It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red lion and sun or of other emblems, signs or signals provided for by the Conventions or by this Protocol. It is also prohibited to misuse deliberately in an armed conflict other internationally recognized protective emblems, signs or signals, including the flag of truce, and the protective emblem of cultural property.   
2.  It is prohibited to make use of the distinctive emblem of the United Nations, except as authorized by that Organization.   

### Article  39  

####Emblems of nationality

1.  It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.   
2.  It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations.   
3.  Nothing in this Article or in Article 37, paragraph 1 (d), shall affect the existing generally recognized rules of international law applicable to espionage or to the use of flags in the conduct of armed conflict at sea.   

### Article  40  

####Quarter

It is prohibited to order that there shall be no survivors, to threaten an adversary therewith or to conduct hostilities on this basis.  

### Article  41  

####Safeguard of an enemy hors de combat

1.  A person who is recognized or who, in the circumstances, should be recognized to be *hors de combat* shall not be made the object of attack.   
2.  A person is *hors de combat* if: 

(a) he is in the power of an adverse Party;  

(b) he clearly expresses an intention to surrender; or  

(c) he has been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and therefore is incapable of defending himself;   provided that in any of these cases he abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape.   
3.  When persons entitled to protection as prisoners of war have fallen into the power of an adverse Party under unusual conditions of combat which prevent their evacuation as provided for in Part III, Section I, of the Third Convention, they shall be released and all feasible precautions shall be taken to ensure their safety.   

### Article  42  

####Occupants of aircraft

1.  No person parachuting from an aircraft in distress shall be made the object of attack during his descent.   
2.  Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party, a person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack, unless it is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act.   
3.  Airborne troops are not protected by this Article.   

### SECTION  II  

####COMBATANT AND PRISONER-OF-WAR STATUS

### Article  43  

####Armed forces

1.  The armed forces of a Party to a conflict consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by a government or an authority not recognized by an adverse Party. Such armed forces shall be subject to an internal disciplinary system which, inter alia, shall enforce compliance with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.   
2.  Members of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict (other than medical personnel and chaplains covered by Article 33 of the Third Convention) are combatants, that is to say, they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.   
3.  Whenever a Party to a conflict incorporates a paramilitary or armed law inforcement agency into its armed forces it shall so notify the other Parties to the conflict.   

### Article  44  

####Combatants and prisoners of war

1.  Any combatant, as defined in Article 43, who falls into the power of an adverse Party shall be a prisoner of war.   
2.  While all combatants are obliged to comply with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, violations of these rules shall not deprive a combatant of his right to be a combatant or, if he falls into the power of an adverse Party, of his right to be a prisoner of war, except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4.   
3.  In order to promote the protection of the civilian population from the effects of hostilities, combatants are obliged to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack. Recognizing, however, that there are situations in armed conflicts where, owing to the nature of the hostilities an armed combatant cannot so distinguish himself, he shall retain his status as a combatant, provided that, in such situations, he carries his arms openly: 

(a) during each military engagement, and  

(b) during such time as he is visible to the adversary while he is engaged in a military deployment preceding the launching of an attack in which he is to participate.   Acts which comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall not be considered as perfidious within the meaning of Article 37, paragraph 1 (c).   
4.  A combatant who falls into the power of an adverse Party while failing to meet the requirements set forth in the second sentence of paragraph 3 shall forfeit his right to be a prisoner of war, but he shall, nevertheless, be given protections equivalent in all respect to those accorded to prisoners of war by the Third Convention and by this Protocol. This protection includes protections equivalent to those accorded to prisoners of war by the Third Convention in the case where such a person is tried and punished for any offences he has committed.   
5.  Any combatant who falls into the power of an adverse Party while not engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack shall not forfeit his rights to be a combatant and a prisoner of war by virtue of his prior activities.   
6.  This Article is without prejudice to the right of any person to be a prisoner of war pursuant to Article 4 of the Third Convention.   
7.  This Article is not intended to change the generally accepted practice of States with respect to the wearing of the uniform by combatants assigned to the regular, uniformed armed units of a Party to the conflict.   
8.  In addition to the categories of persons mentioned in Article 13 of the First and Second Conventions, all members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict, as defined in Article 43 of this Protocol, shall be entitled to protection under those Conventions if they are wounded or sick or, in the case of the Second Convention, shipwrecked at sea or in other waters.   

### Article  45  

####Protection of persons who have taken part in hostilities

1.  A person who takes part in hostilities and falls into the power of an adverse Party shall be presumed to be a prisoner of war, and therefore shall be protected by the Third Convention, if he claims the status of prisoner of war, or if he appears to be entitled to such status, or if the Party on which he depends claims such status on his behalf by notification to the detaining Power or to the Protecting Power. Should any doubt arise as to whether any such person is entitled to the status of prisoner of war, he shall continue to have such status and, therefore, to be protected by the Third Convention and this Protocol until such time as his status has been determined by a competent tribunal.   
2.  If a person who has fallen into the power of an adverse Party is not held as a prisoner of war and is to be tried by that Party for an offence arising out of the hostilities, he shall have the right to assert his entitlement to prisoner-of-war status before a judicial tribunal and to have that question adjudicated. Whenever possible under the applicable procedure, this adjudication shall occur before the trial for the offence. The representatives of the Protecting Power shall be entitled to attend the proceedings in which that question is adjudicated, unless, exceptionally, the proceedings are held in camera in the interest of State security. In such a case the detaining Power shall advise the Protecting Power accordingly.   
3.  Any person who has taken part in hostilities, who is not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and who does not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the Fourth Convention shall have the right at all times to the protection of Article 75 of this Protocol. In occupied territory, any such person, unless he is held as a spy, shall also be entitled, notwithstanding Article 5 of the Fourth Convention, to his rights of communication under that Convention.   

### Article  46  

####Spies

1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Conventions or of this Protocol, any member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict who falls into the power of an adverse Party while engaging in espionage shall not have the right to the status of prisoner of war and may be treated as a spy.   
2.  A member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict who, on behalf of that Party and in territory controlled by an adverse Party, gathers or attempts to gather information shall not be considered as engaging in espionage if, while so acting, he is in the uniform of his armed forces.   
3.  A member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict who is a resident of territory occupied by an adverse Party and who, on behalf of the Party on which he depends, gathers or attempts to gather information of military value within that territory shall not be considered as engaging in espionage unless he does so through an act of false pretences or deliberately in a clandestine manner. Moreover, such a resident shall not lose his right to the status of prisoner of war and may not be treated as a spy unless he is captured while engaging in espionage.   
4.  A member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict who is not a resident of territory occupied by an adverse Party and who has engaged in espionage in that territory shall not lose his right to the status of prisoner of war and may not be treated as a spy unless he is captured before he has rejoined the armed forces to which he belongs.   

### Article  47  

####Mercenaries

1.  A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.   
2.  A mercenary is any person who: 

(a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;  

(b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;  

(c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;  

(d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;  

(e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and  

(f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.     

### PART  IV  

####CIVILIAN POPULATION

### SECTION  I  

####GENERAL PROTECTION AGAINST EFFECTS OF HOSTILITIES

### Chapter  I  

####BASIC RULE AND FIELD APPLICATION

### Article  48  

####Basic rule

In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.  

### Article  49  

####Definition of attacks ad scope of application

1.  “Attacks” means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.   
2.  The provisions of this Protocol with respect to attacks apply to all attacks in whatever territory conducted, including the national territory belonging to a Party to the conflict but under the control of an adverse Party,   
3.  The provisions of this Section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.   
4.  The provisions of this Section are additional to the rules concerning humanitarian protection contained in the Fourth Convention, particularly in Part II thereof, and in other international agreements binding upon the High Contracting Parties, as well as to other rules of international law relating to the protection of civilians and civilian objects on land, at sea or in the air against the effects of hostilities.   

### Chapter  II  

####CIVILIANS AND CIVILIAN POPULATION

### Article  50  

####Definition of civilians and civilian population

1.  A civilian is any person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4 A (1), (2), (3) and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of this Protocol. In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian.   
2.  The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians.   
3.  The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population of its civilian character.   

### Article  51  

####Protection of the civilian population

1.  The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.   
2.  The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack, Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.   
3.  Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.   
4.  Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are: 

(a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective;  

(b) those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or  

(c) those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol;   and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.   
5.  Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate: 

(a) an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and  

(b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.     
6.  Attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited.   
7.  The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.   
8.  Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures provided for in Article 57.   

### Chapter  III  

####CIVILIAN OBJECTS

### Article  52  

####General protection of civilian objects

1.  Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.   
2.  Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.   
3.  In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.   

### Article  53  

####Protection of cultural objects and of places of worship

Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954, and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited: 

(a) to commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;  

(b) to use such objects in support of the military effort;  

(c) to make such objects the object of reprisals.    

### Article  54  

####Protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population

1.  Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.   
2.  It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.   
3.  The prohibitions in paragraph 2 shall not apply to such of the objects covered by it as are used by an adverse Party: 

(a) as sustenance solely for the members of its armed forces; or  

(b) if not as sustenance, then in direct support of military action, provided, however, that in no event shall actions against these objects be taken which may be expected to leave the civilian population with such inadequate food or water as to cause its starvation or force its movement.     
4.  These objects shall not be made the object of reprisals.   
5.  In recognition of the vital requirements of any Party to the conflict in the defence of its national territory against invasion, derogation from the prohibitions contained in paragraph 2 may be made by a Party to the conflict within such territory under its own control where required by imperative military necessity.   

### Article  55  

####Protection of the natural environment

1.  Care shall be taken in warfare to protect the natural environment against widespread, long-term and severe damage. This protection includes a prohibition of the use of methods or means of warfare which are intended or may be expected to cause such damage to the natural environment and thereby to prejudice the health or survival of the population.   
2.  Attacks against the natural environment by way of reprisals are prohibited.   

### Article  56  

####Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces

1.  Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.   
2.  The special protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease: 

(a) for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support;  

(b) for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support;  

(c) for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support.     
3.  In all cases, the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law, including the protection of the precautionary measures provided for in Article 57. If the protection ceases and any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 is attacked, all practical precautions shall be taken to avoid the release of the dangerous forces.   
4.  It is prohibited to make any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 the object of reprisals.   
5.  The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to avoid locating any military objectives in the vicinity of the works or installations mentioned in paragraph 1. Nevertheless, installations erected for the sole purpose of defending the protected works or installations from attack are permissible and shall not themselves be made the object of attack, provided that they are not used in hostilities except for defensive actions necessary to respond to attacks against the protected works or installations and that their armament is limited to weapons capable only of repelling hostile action against the protected works or installations.   
6.  The High Contracting Parties and the Parties to the conflict are urged to conclude further agreements among themselves to provide additional protection for objects containing dangerous forces.   
7.  In order to facilitate the identification of the objects protected by this Article, the Parties to the conflict may mark them with a special sign consisting of a group of three bright orange circles placed on the same axis, as specified in Article 16 of Annex I to this Protocol. The absence of such marking in no way relieves any Party to the conflict of its obligations under this Article.

### Article  63  

####Civil defence in occupied territories

1.  In occupied territories, civilian civil defence organizations shall receive from the authorities the facilities necessary for the performance of their tasks. In no circumstances shall their personnel be compelled to perform activities which would interfere with the proper performance of these tasks.

Notification of such assistance shall be given as soon as possible to any adverse Party concerned. In no circumstances shall this activity be deemed to be an interference in the conflict. This activity should, however, be performed with due regard to the security interests of the Parties to the conflict concerned.   
2.  The Parties to the conflict receiving the assistance referred to in paragraph 1 and the High Contracting Parties granting it should facilitate international co-ordination of such civil defence actions when appropriate. In such cases the relevant international organizations are covered by the provisions of this Chapter.   
3.  In occupied territories, the Occupying Power may only exclude or restrict the activities of civilian civil defence organizations of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict and of international co-ordinating organizations if it can ensure the adequate performance of civil defence tasks from its own resources or those of the occupied territory.   

### Article  65  

####Cessation of protection

1.  The protection to which civilian civil defence organizations, their personnel, buildings, shelters and *matériel* are entitled shall not cease unless they commit or are used to commit, outside their proper tasks, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit, and after such warning has remained unheeded.   
2.  The following shall not be considered as acts harmful to the enemy: 

(a) that civil defence tasks are carried out under the direction or control of military authorities;  

(b) that civilian civil defence personnel co-operate with military personnel in the performance of civil defence tasks, or that some military personnel are attached to civilian civil defence organizations;  

(c) that the performance of civil defence tasks may incidentally benefit military victims, particularly those who are *hors de combat.*     
3.  It shall also not be considered as an act harmful to the enemy that civilian civil defence personnel bear light individual weapons for the purpose of maintaining order or for self-defence. However, in areas where land fighting is taking place or is likely to take place, the Parties to the conflict shall undertake the appropriate measures to limit these weapons to handguns, such as pistols of revolvers, in order to assist in distinguishing between civil defence personnel and combatants. Although civil defence personnel bear other light individual weapons in such areas, they shall nevertheless be respected and protected as soon as they have been recognized as such.   
4.  The formation of civilian civil defence organizations along military lines, and compulsory service in them, shall also not deprive them of the protection conferred by this Chapter.   

### Article  66  

####Identification

1.  Each Party to the conflict shall endeavour to ensure that its civil defence organizations, their personnel, buildings and *matériel,* are identifiable while they are exclusively devoted to the performance of civil defence tasks. Shelters provided for the civilian population should be similarly identifiable.   
2.  Each Party to the conflict shall also endeavour to adopt and implement methods and procedures which will make it possible to recognize civilian shelters as well as civil defence personnel, buildings and *matériel* on which the international distinctive sign of civil defence is displayed.   
3.  In occupied territories and in areas where fighting is taking place or is likely to take place, civilian civil defence personnel should be recognizable by the international distinctive sign of civil defence and by an identity card certifying their status.   
4.  The international distinctive sign of civil defence is an equilateral blue triangle on an orange ground when used for the protection of civil defence organizations, their personnel, buildings and *matériel* and for civilian shelters.   
5.  In addition to the distinctive sign, Parties to the conflict may agree upon the use of distinctive signals for civil defence identification purposes.   
6.  The application of the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 is governed by Chapter V of Annex I to this Protocol.   
7.  In time of peace, the sign described in paragraph 4 may, with the consent of the competent national authorities, be used for civil defence identification purposes.   
8.  The High Contracting Parties and the Parties to the conflict shall take the measures necessary to supervise the display of the international distinctive sign of civil defence and to prevent and repress any misuse thereof.   
9.  The identification of civil defence medical and religious personnel, medical units and medical transports is also governed by Article 18.   

### Article  67  

####Members of the armed forces and military units assigned to civil defence organizations

1.  Members of the armed forces and military units assigned to civil defence organizations shall be respected and protected, provided that: 

(a) such personnel and such units are permanently assigned and exclusively devoted to the performance of any of the tasks mentioned in Article 61;  

(b) if so assigned, such personnel do not perform any other military duties during the conflict;  

(c) such personnel are clearly distinguishable from the members of the armed forces by prominently displaying the international distinctive sign of civil defence, which shall be as large as appropriate, and such personnel are provided with the identity card referred to in Chapter V of Annex I to this Protocol certifying their status;  

(d) such personnel and such units are equipped only with light individual weapons for the purpose of maintaining order or for selfdefence. The provisions of Article 65, paragraph 3 shall also apply in this case;  

(e) such personnel do not participate directly in hostilities, and do not commit, or are not used to commit, outside their civil defence tasks, acts harmful to the adverse Party;  

(f) such personnel and such units perform their civil defence tasks only within the national territory of their party.   The non-observance of the conditions stated in (e) above by any member of the armed forces who is bound by the conditions prescribed in (a) and (b) above is prohibited.   
2.  Military personnel serving within civil defence organizations shall, if they fall into the power of an adverse Party, be prisoners of war. In occupied territory they may, but only in the interest of the civilian population of that territory, be employed on civil defence tasks in so far as the need arises, provided however that, if such work is dangerous, they volunteer for such tasks.   
3.  The buildings and major items of equipment and transports of military units assigned to civil defence organizations shall be clearly marked with the international distinctive sign of civil defence. This distinctive sign shall be as large as appropriate.   
4.  The *matériel* and buildings of military units permanently assigned to civil defence organizations and exclusively devoted to the performance of civil defence tasks shall, if they fall into the hands of an adverse Party, remain subject to the laws of war. They may not be diverted from their civil defence purpose so long as they are required for the performance of civil defence tasks, except in case of imperative military necessity, unless previous arrangements have been made for adequate provision for the needs of the civilian population.

1.  Children shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against any form of indecent assault. The Parties to the conflict shall provide them with the care and aid they require, whether because of their age or for any other reason.   
2.  The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces.

### Article  78  

####Evacuation of children

1.  No Party to the conflict shall arrange for the evacuation of children, other than its own nationals, to a foreign country except for a temporary evacuation where compelling reasons of the health or medical treatment of the children or, except in occupied territory, their safety, so require. Where the parents or legal guardians can be found, their written consent to such evacuation is required. If these persons cannot be found, the written consent to such evacuation of the persons who by law or custom are primarily responsible for the care of the children is required. Any such evacuation shall be supervised by the Protecting Power in agreement with the Parties concerned, namely, the Party arranging for the evacuation, the Party receiving the children and any Parties whose nationals are being evacuated. In each case, all Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible precautions to avoid endangering the evacuation.   
2.  Whenever an evacuation occurs pursuant to paragraph 1, each child's education, including his religious and moral education as his parents desire, shall be provided while he is away with the greatest possible continuity.   
3.  With a view to facilitating the return to their families and country of children evacuated pursuant to this Article, the authorities of the Party arranging for the evacuation and, as appropriate, the authorities of the receiving country shall establish for each child a card with photographs, which they shall send to the Central Tracing Agency of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Each card shall bear, whenever possible, and whenever it involves no risk of harm to the child, the following information:

3.  Medical vehicles should exhibit one or more flashing blue lights visible from as far away as possible. The High Contracting Parties and, in particular, the Parties to the conflict which use lights of other colours should give notification of this.   
4.  The recommended blue colour is obtained when its chromaticity is within the boundaries of the ICI chromaticity diagram defined by the following equations:  

|
|
| green boundary  white boundary  purple boundary  | y = 0.065 + 0,805x  y = 0.400 – x  x = 0.133 + 0,600y  |

The recommended flashing rate of the blue light is between sixty and one hundred flashes per minute.   

### Article  8  

####Radio signal

In order to facilitate the Communications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, as well as the Communications referred to in Articles 22, 23 and 25 to 31 of the Protocol, the High Contracting Parties, the Parties to a conflict, or one of the Parties to a conflict, acting in agreement or alone, may designate, in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations in the Radio Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, and publish selected national frequencies to be used by them for such communications. The International Telecommunication Union shall be notified of these frequencies in accordance with procedures approved by a World Administrative Radio Conference.   

### Article  9  

####Electronic identification

1.  The Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) system, as specified in Annex 10 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944, as amended from time to time, may be used to identify and to follow the course of medical aircraft. The SSR mode and code to be reserved for the exclusive use of medical aircraft shall be established by the High Contracting Parties, the Parties to a conflict, or one of the Parties to a conflict, acting in agreement or alone, in accordance with procedures to be recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization.   
2.  Protected medical transports may, for their identification and location, use standard aeronautical radar transponders and/or maritime search and rescue radar transponders. It should be possible for protected medical transports to be identified by other vessels or aircraft equipped with secondary surveillance radar by means of a code transmitted by a radar transponder, e.g. in mode 3/A, fitted on the medical transports. The code transmitted by the medical transport transponder should be assigned to that transport by the competent authorities and notified to all the Parties to the conflict.   
3.  It should be possible for medical transports to be identified by submarines by the appropriate underwater acoustic signals transmitted by the medical transports. The underwater acoustic signal shall consist of the call sign (or any other recognized means of identification of medical transport) of the ship preceded by the single group YYY transmitted in morse on an appropriate acoustic frequency, e.g. 5kHz. Parties to a conflict wishing to use the underwater acoustic identification signal described above shall inform the Parties concerned of the signal as soon as possible, and shall, when notifying the use of their hospital ships, confirm the frequency to be employed.   
4.  Parties to a conflict may, by special agreement between them, establish for their use a similar electronic system for the identification of medical vehicles, and medical ships and craft.

Deze personen blijven de voordelen van de desbetreffende bepalingen van de Verdragen en dit Protocol genieten tot hun definitieve invrijheidstelling, repatriëring of nieuwe vestiging.    

### Artikel  4  

####Juridische status van de partijen bij het conflict

De toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol, alsook het sluiten van de overeenkomsten die daarin zijn voorzien, zijn niet van invloed op de juridische status van de partijen bij het conflict. Noch de bezetting van een gebied, noch de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol zijn van invloed op de juridische status van het desbetreffende gebied.  

### Artikel  5  

####Aanwijzing van beschermende mogendheden en van hun plaatsvervangers

1.  Het is de plicht van de partijen bij een conflict, om vanaf de aanvang van dat conflict de nakoming en de uitvoering van de Verdragen en dit Protocol te verzekeren door middel van toepassing van het stelsel van beschermende mogendheden, dat onder andere aanwijzing en aanvaarding van die mogendheden inhoudt overeenkomstig de volgende leden. De beschermende mogendheden zijn belast met het beschermen van de belangen van de partijen bij het conflict.   
2.  Bij de aanvang van een situatie als bedoeld in artikel 1 wijst iedere partij bij het conflict onverwijld een beschermende mogendheid aan met het oog op de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol en geeft, eveneens onverwijld en met hetzelfde doel, toestemming tot de werkzaamheden van een beschermende mogendheid die zij na aanwijzing door de tegenpartij als zodanig heeft aanvaard.   
3.  Indien bij de aanvang van een situatie als bedoeld in artikel 1 geen beschermende mogendheid is aangewezen of aanvaard, biedt het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis, onverminderd het recht van enige andere onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie hetzelfde te doen, de partijen bij het conflict zijn goede diensten aan met het oog op de onverwijlde aanwijzing van een beschermende mogendheid die de instemming van de partijen bij het conflict heeft. Te dien einde kan het Internationale Comité onder andere elke partij verzoeken, een lijst over te leggen van ten minste vijf Staten welke die partij aanvaardbaar acht om te haren behoeve ten opzichte van een tegenpartij als beschermende mogendheid op te treden, en elke tegenpartij verzoeken, een lijst over te leggen van ten minste vijf Staten die zij bereid is als beschermende mogendheid van de andere partij te aanvaarden; deze lijsten worden binnen twee weken na de ontvangst van het verzoek toegezonden aan het Comité, dat deze vergelijkt en zal trachten de instemming te verkrijgen van iedere Staat die op beide lijsten voorkomt.   
4.  Indien er ondanks het bovenstaande geen beschermende mogendheid is, dienen de partijen bij het conflict onverwijld een aanbod te aanvaarden, dat kan worden gedaan door het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of door enige andere organisatie die alle waarborgen van onpartijdigheid en doeltreffendheid biedt, na raadpleging van de bovenbedoelde partijen en met inachtneming van de uitkomst van die raadplegingen, om op te treden als plaatsvervanger. Een zodanige plaatsvervanger kan zijn functie slechts uitoefenen met toestemming van de partijen bij het conflict; de partijen bij het conflict moeten alles in het werk stellen om de werkzaamheden door de plaatsvervanger verricht bij de uitoefening van zijn taak krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol, te vergemakkelijken.   
5.  Overeenkomstig artikel 4 zijn de aanwijzing en de aanvaarding van beschermende mogendheden met het oog op de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol niet van invloed op de juridische status van de partijen bij het conflict of van enig gebied, daaronder begrepen bezet gebied.   
6.  Het feit dat de partijen bij het conflict diplomatieke betrekkingen met elkaar onderhouden, of dat een partij de bescherming van haar belangen en die van haar onderdanen aan een derde Staat heeft toevertrouwd overeenkomstig de regels van het volkenrecht betreffende de diplomatieke betrekkingen, vormt geen beletsel voor de aanwijzing van beschermende mogendheden met het oog op de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol.   
7.  Iedere navolgende vermelding in dit Protocol van een beschermende mogendheid omvat mede een plaatsvervanger.   

### Artikel  6  

####Deskundige personen

1.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen streven er ook in vredestijd naar met de hulp van nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon)-organisaties, deskundig personeel op te leiden om de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol en in het bijzonder de werkzaamheden van de beschermende mogendheden te vergemakkelijken.   
2.  De werving en de opleiding van zodanig personeel behoren tot de nationale competentie.   
3.  Het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis houdt de lijsten van de aldus opgeleide personen, die de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen met dat doel mochten hebben opgesteld en aan het Comité mochten hebben toegezonden, ter beschikking van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
4.  De voorwaarden, waaraan de tewerkstelling van zodanig personeel buiten nationaal grondgebied is onderworpen, vormen per geval onderwerp van bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen de betrokken partijen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Bijeenkomsten

De depositaris van dit Protocol roept een bijeenkomst van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen bijeen op verzoek van één of meer van die partijen en met de instemming van de meerderheid van die partijen, ten einde algemene problemen betreffende de toepassing van de Verdragen en dit Protocol te bestuderen.

Dit Deel, waarvan de bepalingen zijn bedoeld om de toestand van de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen te verbeteren, is van toepassing op allen die zich in een situatie bevinden als bedoeld in artikel 1, zonder enig nadelig onderscheid gebaseerd op ras, huidskleur, geslacht, taal, godsdienst of geloof, politieke of andere overtuiging, nationale of maatschappelijke afkomst, rijkdom, geboorte of andere status, of op enig ander soortgelijk criterium.   
2.  De desbetreffende bepalingen van de artikelen 27 en 32 van het Eerste Verdrag zijn van toepassing op permanente medische formaties en vervoermiddelen (met uitzondering van hospitaalschepen, waarop artikel 25 van het Tweede Verdrag van toepassing is) en het personeel daarvan, die voor humanitaire doeleinden ter beschikking van een partij bij het conflict zijn gesteld:

### Artikel  10  

####Bescherming en verzorging

1.  Alle gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, tot welke partij zij ook behoren, dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd.   
2.  Zij moeten onder alle omstandigheden menselijk worden behandeld en in de grootst mogelijke omvang en binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd de medische verzorging en aandacht ontvangen, die hun toestand vereist. Er mag op geen andere dan op medische gronden onderscheid tussen hen worden gemaakt.   

### Artikel  11  

####Bescherming van personen

1.  De lichamelijke en geestelijke gezondheid en integriteit van personen die zich in de macht van de tegenpartij bevinden of die zijn geïnterneerd, die gevangen worden gehouden of op andere wijze van hun vrijheid zijn beroofd ten gevolge van een situatie als bedoeld in artikel 1, mogen niet door enig ongerechtvaardigd handelen of nalaten in gevaar worden gebracht. Dientengevolge is het verboden de personen, bedoeld in dit artikel, te onderwerpen aan medische handelingen die niet noodzakelijk zijn als gevolg van de gezondheidstoestand van de betrokken persoon en die niet in overeenstemming zijn met de algemeen aanvaarde medische normen welke onder gelijke medische omstandigheden zouden worden toegepast ten aanzien van personen die onderdaan zijn van de voor de handelingen verantwoordelijke partij en die op geen enkele wijze van hun vrijheid zijn beroofd.   
2.  Het is in het bijzonder verboden bij dergelijke personen, zelfs met hun toestemming, uit te voeren: 

(a) lichamelijke verminkingen;  

(b) medische of wetenschappelijke experimenten;  

(c) verwijdering van weefsel of organen voor transplantatie, behalve wanneer die handelingen gerechtvaardigd zijn overeenkomstig de voorwaarden”, neergelegd in het eerste lid.     
3.  Uitzonderingen op het verbod, neergelegd in het tweede lid, letter c, kunnen alleen worden gemaakt in het geval dat bloed wordt afgestaan voor transfusie, of huid voor transplantatie, mits dit vrijwillig en zonder enige dwang of aandrang geschiedt, en dan nog slechts voor therapeutische doeleinden, onder omstandigheden die beantwoorden aan de algemeen aanvaarde medische normen en maatregelen van toezicht, die zowel het belang van de donor als van de ontvanger beogen.   
4.  Ieder opzettelijk handelen of nalaten, dat de lichamelijke of geestelijke gezondheid of integriteit in gevaar brengt van enige persoon, die zich in de macht bevindt van een andere partij dan de partij waartoe hij behoort, en dat hetzij een overtreding vormt van een van de verboden, neergelegd in het eerste en tweede lid, hetzij niet in overeenstemming is met de vereisten, vervat in het derde lid, levert een ernstige inbreuk op dit Protocol op.   
5.  De personen, bedoeld in het eerste lid, hebben het recht om iedere operatieve ingreep te weigeren. In het geval van een weigering dient het medische personeel te trachten een desbetreffende schriftelijke verklaring, ondertekend of bevestigd door de patiënt, te verkrijgen.   
6.  Iedere partij bij het conflict moet een medisch register bijhouden van alle gevallen van het afstaan van bloed voor transfusie of huid voor transplantatie door personen, bedoeld in het eerste lid, indien die afstand geschiedt onder verantwoordelijkheid van die partij. Bovendien dient iedere partij bij het conflict te trachten een register bij te houden van alle medische handelingen, uitgevoerd met betrekking tot iedere persoon die is geïnterneerd, die gevangen wordt gehouden of op andere wijze van zijn vrijheid is beroofd ten gevolge van een situatie als bedoeld in artikel 1. Deze registers dienen te allen tijde voor onderzoek door de beschermende mogendheid beschikbaar te zijn.   

### Artikel  12  

####Bescherming van medische formaties

1.  Medische formaties dienen te allen tijde te worden ontzien en beschermd en mogen niet worden aangevallen.   
2.  Het eerste lid is van toepassing op burgerlijke medische formaties, mits deze: 

(a) tot een van de partijen bij het conflict behoren;  

(b) zijn erkend en toegelaten door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een van de partijen bij het conflict; dan wel  

(c) zijn toegelaten overeenkomstig artikel 9, eerste lid, van dit Protocol of artikel 27 van het Eerste Verdrag.     
3.  De partijen bij het conflict worden uitgenodigd, elkaar van de plaats waar hun vaste medische formaties zich bevinden, in kennis te stellen. Het ontbreken van een dergelijke kennisgeving ontheft geen van de partijen van de verplichting, aan de bepalingen van het eerste lid te voldoen.   
4.  Onder geen enkele omstandigheid mogen medische formaties worden gebruikt om te trachten militaire objecten tegen aanvallen te beschermen. De partijen bij het conflict dienen er, zo mogelijk, zorg voor te dragen dat de medische formaties zich op zodanige plaatsen bevinden, dat aanvallen op militaire objecten hun veiligheid niet in gevaar brengen.   

### Artikel  13  

####Beëindiging van de bescherming van burgerlijke medische formaties

1.  De bescherming waarop de burgerlijke medische formaties recht hebben eindigt alleen wanneer deze worden gebruikt om buiten hun humanitaire taak voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen te verrichten. De bescherming eindigt evenwel slechts nadat een waarschuwing is gegeven waarin, telkens wanneer daartoe aanleiding is, een redelijke termijn wordt gesteld, en nadat aan die waarschuwing geen gevolg is gegeven.   
2.  Als voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen worden niet beschouwd: 

(a) het feit dat het personeel van de formatie is uitgerust met lichte, persoonlijke wapens voor zijn eigen verdediging of voor die van de gewonden en zieken, met de zorg waarvoor het is belast;  

b) het feit dat de formatie wordt bewaakt door een piket, door schildwachten of door een geleide;  

(c) het feit dat draagbare wapens en munitie, die van de gewonden en zieken zijn afgenomen en nog niet aan de bevoegde tak van dienst zijn afgeleverd, in de formatie worden aangetroffen;  

(d) het feit dat leden van de strijdkrachten of andere combattanten zich om medische redenen bij de formatie bevinden.     

### Artikel  14  

####Beperkingen op het vorderen van burgerlijke medische formaties

1.  De bezettende mogendheid heeft de plicht te verzekeren, dat onafgebroken kan worden voorzien in de medische behoeften van de burgerbevolking in bezet gebied.   
2.  De bezettende mogendheid mag derhalve geen burgerlijke medische formaties, hun uitrusting, hun materieel of de diensten van hun personeel vorderen, zolang die hulpmiddelen noodzakelijk zijn voor het verschaffen van toereikende medische diensten ten behoeve van de burgerbevolking en voor de voortzetting van de medische verzorging van de gewonden en zieken, die reeds onder behandeling zijn.   
3.  De bezettende mogendheid mag, mits hij de algemene regel, neergelegd in het tweede lid, in acht blijft nemen, de bovenbedoelde hulpmiddelen vorderen onder de volgende bijzondere voorwaarden: 

(a) dat de hulpmiddelen nodig zijn voor een toereikende en onmiddellijke medische behandeling van de gewonden en zieken van de strijdkrachten van de bezettende mogendheid of van krijgsgevangenen;  

(b) dat de vordering niet langer duurt dan gezien het bovenstaande noodzakelijk is;  

(c) dat onmiddellijk maatregelen worden genomen om te verzekeren dat onafgebroken kan worden voorzien in de medische behoeften van de burgerbevolking, evenals in die van de gewonden en zieken onder behandeling die door de vordering worden getroffen.     

### Artikel  15  

####Bescherming van burgerlijk medisch personeel en geestelijke verzorgers

1.  Burgerlijk medisch personeel dient te worden ontzien en beschermd.   
2.  Met alle beschikbare middelen moet, indien nodig, hulp worden verleend aan het burgerlijke medisch personeel in gebieden waar de burgerlijke medische diensten door de vijandelijkheden zijn ontwricht.   
3.  De bezettende mogendheid moet het burgerlijke medisch personeel in bezette gebieden alle bijstand verlenen om het in staat te stellen naar beste vermogen zijn humanitaire taak te vervullen. De bezettende mogendheid mag niet eisen, dat dit personeel bij de uitoefening van die taak voorrang geeft aan de behandeling van enige persoon, behalve op medische gronden. Het mag niet worden verplicht taken te verrichten die onverenigbaar zijn met zijn humanitaire opdracht.   
4.  Het burgerlijke medisch personeel moet toegang hebben tot alle plaatsen waar zijn diensten onmisbaar zijn; het is daarbij onderworpen aan de maatregelen van toezicht en aan de veiligheidsmaatregelen die de desbetreffende partij bij het conflict noodzakelijk acht.   
5.  Burgerlijke geestelijke verzorgers dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd. De bepalingen van de Verdragen en dit Protocol betreffende de bescherming en de herkenbaarheid van het medisch personeel zijn gelijkelijk op hen van toepassing.   

### Artikel  16  

####Algemene bescherming van de medische taakvervulling

1.  Niemand mag, onder welke omstandigheden ook, worden gestraft voor het uitvoeren van medische behandelingen die met de medische ethiek in overeenstemming zijn, ongeacht degenen aan wie deze handelingen ten goede komen.   
2.  Personen die medische handelingen uitvoeren, mogen niet worden verplicht daden of werkzaamheden te verrichten, die in strijd zijn met de regels van de medische ethiek of met andere medische regels, opgesteld in het belang van de gewonden en de zieken, of met de bepalingen van de Verdragen en dit Protocol, noch mogen zij worden gedwongen af te zien van het verrichten van daden of werkzaamheden, door die regels en bepalingen voorgeschreven.   
3.  Niemand die medische handelingen uitvoert, mag worden verplicht, aan iemand die behoort tot een tegenpartij of tot zijn eigen partij, behalve voor zover dat door de wetgeving van de laatstbedoelde partij wordt vereist, inlichtingen te verstrekken betreffende de gewonden en zieken die hij verzorgt of heeft verzorgd, indien deze inlichtingen naar zijn oordeel schadelijk zouden kunnen zijn voor de desbetreffende patiënten of hun families. De voorschriften inzake de verplichte melding van besmettelijke ziekten dienen evenwel in acht te worden genomen.   

### Artikel  17  

####Rol van de burgerbevolking en van de verenigingen tot hulpverlening

1.  De burgerbevolking dient de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen te ontzien, zelfs indien deze tot de tegenpartij behoren, en mag geen gewelddaden tegen hen begaan. Aan de burgerbevolking en de verenigingen tot hulpverlening, zoals nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon)-organisaties, is het toegestaan, zelfs eigener beweging de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen te verzamelen en te verzorgen, zelfs in gebieden waar een inval heeft plaatsgevonden of die zijn bezet. Niemand mag worden gedeerd, vervolgd, veroordeeld of gestraft voor dergelijke humanitaire handelingen.   
2.  De partijen bij het conflict kunnen een beroep doen op de burgerbevolking en de verenigingen tot hulpverlening, bedoeld in het eerste lid, de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen te verzamelen en te verzorgen, naar de doden te zoeken en de plaats waar deze zich bevinden te melden; de partijen dienen zowel bescherming als de noodzakelijke faciliteiten te verlenen aan diegenen die aan dit beroep gevolg hebben gegeven. Indien de tegenpartij het gebied in haar macht mocht krijgen, of wederom in haar macht mocht krijgen, moet zij deze bescherming en faciliteiten blijven verlenen zolang zij noodzakelijk zijn.   

### Artikel  18  

####Identificatie

1.  Iedere partij bij het conflict moet de herkenbaarheid trachten te verzekeren van het medische personeel, de geestelijke verzorgers en de medische formaties en transporten.   
2.  Iedere partij bij het conflict moet eveneens trachten, werkwijzen en procedures te aanvaarden en ten uitvoer te leggen die het mogelijk maken, medisch formaties en transporten te herkennen, die het kenteken en de herkenningsseinen gebruiken.   
3.  In bezet gebied en in gebieden, waar gevechten plaatsvinden of vermoedelijk zullen plaatsvinden, dienen het burgerlijke medisch personeel en de burgerlijke geestelijke verzorgers herkenbaar te zijn aan het kenteken en aan een identiteitskaart waaruit hun status blijkt.   
4.  De medische formaties en vervoermiddelen moeten, met toestemming van de bevoegde autoriteit, zijn voorzien van het kenteken. De schepen en vaartuigen, bedoeld in artikel 22 van dit Protocol, moeten van kentekenen zijn voorzien overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Tweede Verdrag.   
5.  Een partij bij het conflict kan, als bepaald in Hoofdstuk III van Bijlage I bij dit Protocol, het gebruik van herkenningsseinen naast het kenteken toestaan ter identificatie van medische formaties en vervoermiddelen. Bij wijze van uitzondering mogen medische vervoermiddelen, in de bijzondere in dat Hoofdstuk genoemde gevallen, herkenningsseinen gebruiken zonder het kenteken te tonen.   
6.  De uitvoering van de bepalingen van het eerste tot en met het vijfde lid van dit artikel wordt beheerst door de Hoofdstukken I tot en met III van de Bijlage bij dit Protocol. De seinen in Hoofdstuk III van de Bijlage omschreven en uitsluitend bestemd voor het gebruik door medische formaties en vervoermiddelen mogen, behalve als in dat Hoofdstuk bepaald, voor geen andere doeleinden worden gebruikt dan ter identificatie van de in dat Hoofdstuk omschreven medische formaties en vervoermiddelen.   
7.  Dit artikel staat geen uitgebreider gebruik van het kenteken toe in vredestijd dan is bepaald in artikel 44 van het Eerste Verdrag.   
8.  De bepalingen van de Verdragen en het Protocol betreffende het toezicht op het gebruik van het kenteken en betreffende het voorkomen en het tegengaan van enig misbruik daarvan zijn van toepassing op herkenningsseinen.   

### Artikel  19  

####Neutrale Staten en andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict

Neutrale Staten en andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict dienen de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit Protocol toe te passen ten aanzien van de personen die door dit Deel worden beschermd en die op hun grondgebied mochten worden toegelaten of geïnterneerd, alsmede op alle doden van de partijen bij het conflict die zij mochten vinden.  

### Artikel  20  

####Verbod van represailles

Represailles tegen personen en goederen, die door dit Deel worden beschermd, zijn verboden.  

### SECTIE  II  

####MEDISCH VERVOER

### Artikel  21  

####Medische voertuigen

Medische voertuigen dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd op dezelfde wijze als mobiele medische formaties krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol.  

### Artikel  22  

####Hospitaalschepen en kustreddingboten

1.  De bepalingen van de Verdragen betreffende: 

(a) de vaartuigen, omschreven in de artikelen 22, 24, 25 en 27 van het Tweede Verdrag,  

(b) hun reddingboten en kleine vaartuigen,  

(c) hun personeel en bemanningen,  

(d) de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen aan boord,   zijn eveneens van toepassing wanneer die vaartuigen burgers vervoeren die gewond, ziek of schipbreukeling zijn en niet behoren tot een van de categorieën, vermeld in artikel 13 van het Tweede Verdrag. Die burgers mogen evenwel niet worden overgedragen aan enige partij die niet hun eigen partij is, noch op zee gevangen worden genomen. Indien zij zich in de macht bevinden van een andere partij bij het conflict dan hun eigen partij, zijn het Vierde Verdrag en dit Protocol op hen van toepassing.   
2.  De bescherming door de Verdragen verleend aan de vaartuigen, omschreven in artikel 25 van het Tweede Verdrag, strekt zich mede uit tot de hospitaalschepen, voor humanitaire doeleinden aan een partij bij het conflict ter beschikking gesteld: 

(a) door een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij dat conflict;  

(b) door een onpartijdige internationale humanitaire organisatie mits in beide gevallen aan de in dat artikel vermelde vereisten is voldaan.     
3.  Kleine vaartuigen, omschreven in artikel 27 van het Tweede Verdrag, dienen te worden beschermd, zelfs indien de in dat artikel bedoelde kennisgeving niet is gedaan. De partijen bij het conflict worden evenwel uitgenodigd, elkaar van alle bijzonderheden met betrekking tot die vaartuigen in kennis te stellen, ten einde de identificatie en de herkenning daarvan te vergemakkelijken.   

### Artikel  23  

####Andere medische schepen en vaartuigen

1.  Medische schepen en vaartuigen die niet zijn schepen en vaartuigen, bedoeld in artikel 22 van dit Protocol en artikel 38 van het Tweede Verdrag dienen, hetzij op zee of in andere wateren, te worden ontzien en beschermd op dezelfde wijze als de mobiele medische formaties krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol. Deze schepen dienen, daar de bovengenoemde bescherming slechts kan worden verwezenlijkt indien zij kunnen worden geïdentificeerd en herkend als medische schepen of vaartuigen, te zijn voorzien van het kenteken, en zoveel mogelijk te voldoen aan het bepaalde in artikel 43, tweede lid, van het Tweede Verdrag.   
2.  De schepen en vaartuigen, bedoeld in het eerste lid, blijven onderworpen aan het oorlogsrecht. Ieder oorlogsschip dat aan de oppervlakte vaart en in staat is de opvolging van zijn bevel terstond af te dwingen, kan hun bevelen te stoppen, zich te verwijderen of een bepaalde route te volgen, en zij dienen ieder zodanig bevel op te volgen. Deze schepen en vaartuigen mogen, zolang zij nodig zijn voor de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen aan boord, op geen enkele andere wijze aan hun medische taak worden onttrokken.   
3.  De bescherming, verleend in het eerste lid, eindigt alleen in de omstandigheden, vermeld in de artikelen 34 en 35 van het Tweede Verdrag. Een duidelijke weigering om een bevel, gegeven overeenkomstig het tweede lid, op te volgen vormt een voor de vijand schadelijke handeling krachtens artikel 34 van het Tweede Verdrag.   
4.  Een partij bij het conflict kan iedere tegenpartij, zolang als mogelijk is vóór het vertrek van een medisch schip of vaartuig, in kennis stellen van de naam, de klasse, de verwachte vertrektijd, de koers en de geschatte snelheid ervan, in het bijzonder in het geval van schepen met een bruto inhoud van meer dan 2000 ton, en kan voorts alle gegevens verstrekken ter vergemakkelijking van de identificatie en herkenning. De tegenpartij moet de ontvangst van die gegevens bevestigen.   
5.  De bepalingen van artikel 37 van het Tweede Verdrag zijn van toepassing op het medisch personeel en de geestelijke verzorgers op die schepen en vaartuigen.   
6.  De bepalingen van het Tweede Verdrag zijn van toepassing op de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, die behoren tot de categorieën bedoeld in artikel 13 van het Tweede Verdrag en artikel 44 van dit Protocol, en die zich aan boord van dergelijke schepen en vaartuigen mochten bevinden. De burgers die gewond, ziek of schipbreukeling zijn en niet behoren tot een van de categorieën, vermeld in artikel 13 van het Tweede Verdrag, kunnen op zee niet worden overgedragen aan een partij die niet hun eigen partij is, noch kunnen zij van dergelijke schepen of vaartuigen worden verwijderd; indien zij zich in de macht bevinden van een andere partij bij het conflict dan hun eigen partij, zijn het Vierde Verdrag en dit Protocol op hen van toepassing.   

### Artikel  24  

####Bescherming van medische luchtvaartuigen

Medische luchtvaartuigen dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Deel.  

### Artikel  25  

####Medische luchtvaartuigen in gebieden die niet door een tegenpartij worden beheerst

In landgebieden die daadwerkelijk door bevriende strijdkrachten worden beheerst en in het luchtruim daarboven, of in zeegebieden die niet daadwerkelijk door een tegenpartij worden beheerst en in het luchtruim daarboven, is voor het ontzien en de bescherming van de medische luchtvaartuigen van een partij bij het conflict geen enkele overeenkomst met een tegenpartij vereist. Een partij bij het conflict die in deze gebieden van haar medische luchtvaartuigen gebruik maakt kan evenwel, met het oog op een grotere veiligheid, een kennisgeving als voorzien in artikel 29 tot de tegenpartij richten, in het bijzonder wanneer die luchtvaartuigen vluchten uitvoeren die hen binnen het bereik brengen van grond-lucht-wapensystemen van de tegenpartij.  

### Artikel  26  

####Medische luchtvaartuigen in contact-zones of soortgelijke zones

1.  In die delen van de contact-zone die daadwerkelijk door bevriende strijdkrachten worden beheerst en in het luchtruim daarboven, en in die gebieden die niet duidelijk daadwerkelijk door een bepaalde partij worden beheerst en in het luchtruim daarboven, kan de bescherming van de medische luchtvaartuigen slechts volkomen doeltreffend plaatsvinden krachtens een voorafgaande overeenstemming tussen de bevoegde militaire autoriteiten van de partijen bij het conflict, als voorzien in artikel 29. Ofschoon bij afwezigheid van een dergelijke overeenstemming de medische luchtvaartuigen hun werkzaamheden op eigen risico verrichten, moeten zij worden ontzien wanneer zij als zodanig zijn herkend.   
2.  „Contact-zone” betekent: ieder landgebied waar de vooruitgeschoven onderdelen van de tegenover elkaar staande strijdkrachten contact hebben gemaakt, in het bijzonder waar zij zijn blootgesteld aan rechtstreeks vuur vanaf de grond.   

### Artikel  27  

####Medische luchtvaartuigen in gebieden die worden beheerst door een tegenpartij

1.  De medische luchtvaartuigen van een partij bij het conflict blijven beschermd, wanneer zij over land- of zeegebieden vliegen, die daadwerkelijk worden beheerst door een tegenpartij, mits van de bevoegde autoriteit van die tegenpartij van te voren toestemming voor die vluchten is verkregen.   
2.  Een medisch luchtvaartuig dat over een gebied vliegt dat daadwerkelijk door een tegenpartij wordt beheerst, zonder de in het eerste lid voorziene toestemming of in afwijking van de voorwaarden, verbonden aan een dergelijke toestemming hetzij door een navigatiefout of ten gevolge van een noodtoestand die de veiligheid van de vlucht in gevaar brengt, dient alles in het werk te stellen om zich te identificeren en de tegenpartij van de omstandigheden in kennis te stellen. Zodra een zodanig medisch luchtvaartuig door de tegenpartij is herkend, dient die partij in redelijkheid alles in het werk te stellen om het bevel tot landen op het land of op het water, als bedoeld in artikel 30, te geven, of om andere maatregelen ter bescherming van haar eigen veiligheid te nemen, en in beide gevallen het luchtvaartuig tijd te geven aan dat bevel te voldoen of zich naar die maatregelen te gedragen, alvorens tot een aanval tegen het luchtvaartuig over te gaan.   

### Artikel  28  

####Beperkingen op het gebruik van medische luchtvaartuigen

1.  Het is de partijen bij het conflict verboden, hun medische luchtvaartuigen te gebruiken om enig voordeel over een tegenpartij te behalen. De aanwezigheid van medische luchtvaartuigen mag niet worden gebruikt om te trachten militaire doelen voor aanvallen te vrijwaren.   
2.  De medische luchtvaartuigen mogen niet worden gebruikt om militaire inlichtingen te verzamelen of over te brengen, en mogen geen enkele uitrusting, voor die doeleinden bestemd, vervoeren. Het is hun verboden personen of lading te vervoeren, die niet vallen onder de definitie, opgenomen in artikel 8, punt 6. Het vervoer aan boord van de persoonlijke bezittingen van de inzittenden of van materieel, uitsluitend bestemd om de navigatie, de communicatie of de identificatie te vergemakkelijken, wordt niet als verboden beschouwd.   
3.  De medische luchtvaartuigen mogen geen wapens vervoeren, behalve draagbare wapens en munitie, die van de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen aan boord zijn afgenomen en nog niet aan de bevoegde tak van dienst zijn afgeleverd, en die lichte persoonlijke wapens die nodig zijn om het medische personeel aan boord in staat te stellen zichzelf en de gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen, met de zorg waarvoor het is belast, te verdedigen.   
4.  De medische luchtvaartuigen mogen, wanneer zij de vluchten, bedoeld in de artikelen 26 en 27 uitvoeren, niet worden gebruikt om naar gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen te zoeken, zonder dat daarover van te voren overeenstemming met de tegenpartij is bereikt.   

### Artikel  29  

####Kennisgevingen en afspraken inzake medische luchtvaartuigen

1.  De kennisgevingen krachtens artikel 25, of de verzoeken om voorafgaande overeenstemming krachtens de artikelen 26, 27, 28, vierde lid, of 31, moeten het aantal medische luchtvaartuigen dat men voornemens is te gebruiken, het vluchtplan en de middelen ter identificatie aangeven en worden geacht in te houden, dat elke vlucht zal worden uitgevoerd met inachtneming van artikel 28.   
2.  Een partij die een kennisgeving, gedaan krachtens artikel 25 ontvangt, moet de ontvangst van die kennisgeving onmiddellijk bevestigen.   
3.  Een partij die een verzoek om voorafgaande overeenstemming krachtens de artikelen 26, 27, 28, vierde lid, of 31 ontvangt, moet de verzoekende partij zo snel mogelijk: 

(a) mededelen dat het verzoek is ingewilligd;  

(b) mededelen dat het verzoek is geweigerd; of  

(c) een redelijk tegenvoorstel met betrekking tot het verzoek doen. Zij kan eveneens een verbod of een beperking van andere vluchten in het gebied gedurende de desbetreffende periode voorstellen. Indien de partij die het verzoek heeft gedaan de tegenvoorstellen aanvaardt, stelt zij de andere partij van de aanvaarding in kennis.     
4.  De partijen moeten de nodige maatregelen nemen om te verzekeren, dat de kennisgevingen snel kunnen worden gedaan en de afspraken snel kunnen worden bereikt.   
5.  De partijen moeten eveneens de nodige maatregelen nemen om hetgeen die kennisgevingen en die afspraken behelzen snel aan de betrokken militaire formaties bekend te maken en moeten die formaties inlichtingen verstrekken inzake de middelen ter identificatie, die door de desbetreffende medische luchtvaartuigen zullen worden gebruikt.   

### Artikel  30  

####Landen en inspectie van medische luchtvaartuigen

1.  Medische luchtvaartuigen die vliegen boven gebieden die daadwerkelijk worden beheerst door een tegenpartij, of boven gebieden die niet duidelijk daadwerkelijk door een bepaalde partij worden beheerst, kunnen het bevel ontvangen te landen naar gelang van de omstandigheden, op het land of op het water, ten einde inspectie overeenkomstig de navolgende leden mogelijk te maken. De medische luchtvaartuigen moeten ieder zodanig bevel opvolgen.   
2.  Indien een dergelijk luchtvaartuig landt op het land of op het water, hetzij op bevel of om andere redenen, mag het uitsluitend aan inspectie worden onderworpen ter vaststelling van de zaken, vermeld in het derde en het vierde lid. Iedere zodanige inspectie moet onverwijld worden aangevangen en met voortvarendheid worden uitgevoerd. De inspecterende partij mag niet verlangen, dat de gewonden en zieken uit het vliegtuig worden verwijderd, tenzij verwijdering noodzakelijk is voor de inspectie. Die partij moet er in ieder geval voor zorgdragen, dat de toestand van de gewonden en zieken niet nadelig door de inspectie of de verwijdering wordt beïnvloed.   
3.  Indien de inspectie aantoont dat het luchtvaartuig: 

(a) een medisch luchtvaartuig is in de zin van artikel 8, letter j,  

(b) geen inbreuk maakt op de voorwaarden, omschreven in artikel 28, en,  

(c) indien voorafgaande overeenstemming is vereist, niet heeft gevlogen zonder, of in strijd met deze overeenstemming,   moet aan het luchtvaartuig en aan de inzittenden die behoren tot de tegenpartij of tot een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict, worden toegestaan de vlucht zonder oponthoud voort te zetten.   
4.  Indien de inspectie aantoont dat het luchtvaartuig: 

(a) geen medisch luchtvaartuig is in de zin van artikel 8, letter j,  

(b) inbreuk maakt op de voorwaarden, omschreven in artikel 28, of,  

(c) indien voorafgaande overeenstemming is vereist, heeft gevlogen zonder, of in strijd met deze overeenstemming,   kan het luchtvaartuig worden opgebracht. De inzittenden dienen te worden behandeld overeenkomstig de desbetreffende bepalingen van de Verdragen en dit Protocol. Ieder opgebracht luchtvaartuig dat was aangewezen als permanent medisch luchtvaartuig mag daarna uitsluitend als medisch luchtvaartuig worden gebruikt.   

### Artikel  31  

####Neutrale Staten of andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict

1.  Medische luchtvaartuigen mogen, behalve krachtens een voorafgaande overeenstemming, niet vliegen over of landen op het grondgebied van een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict. Indien een zodanige overeenstemming bestaat, dienen zij evenwel te worden ontzien gedurende hun gehele vlucht en eveneens gedurende een eventuele landing op dat grondgebied. Niettemin moeten zij ieder bevel tot landen op het land of op het water, naar gelang van de omstandigheden, opvolgen.   
2.  Indien een medisch luchtvaartuig, bij afwezigheid van overeenstemming of in afwijking van de voorwaarden waaronder de overeenstemming is tot stand gekomen, vliegt over het grondgebied van een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict, hetzij door een navigatiefout of ten gevolge van een noodtoestand die de veiligheid van de vlucht in gevaar brengt, dient het alles in het werk te stellen om de vlucht te melden en zich te identificeren. Zodra een zodanig medisch luchtvaartuig is herkend, dient die Staat in redelijkheid alles in het werk te stellen om het bevel tot landen op het land of op het water, als bedoeld in artikel 30, eerste lid, te geven, of om andere maatregelen ter bescherming van zijn eigen veiligheid te nemen, en in beide gevallen het luchtvaartuig tijd te geven om aan dat bevel te voldoen of zich naar die maatregelen te gedragen, alvorens tot een aanval tegen het luchtvaartuig over te gaan.   
3.  Indien een medisch luchtvaartuig, hetzij krachtens overeenstemming of in de omstandigheden, vermeld in het tweede lid, landt op het land of op het water behorend tot het grondgebied van een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict, hetzij op bevel of om andere redenen, wordt het luchtvaartuig aan inspectie onderworpen ten einde vast te stellen of het werkelijk een medisch luchtvaartuig is. De inspectie moet onverwijld worden aangevangen en met voortvarendheid worden uitgevoerd. De inspecterende partij mag niet verlangen, dat de gewonden en zieken van de partij die het luchtvaartuig gebruikt daaruit worden verwijderd, tenzij verwijdering noodzakelijk is voor de inspectie. De inspecterende partij moet er in ieder geval voor zorgdragen, dat de toestand van de gewonden en zieken niet nadelig door de inspectie of de verwijdering wordt beïnvloed. Indien de inspectie aantoont, dat het luchtvaartuig werkelijk een medisch luchtvaartuig is, wordt het luchtvaartuig met inzittenden, met uitzondering van degenen die overeenkomstig de regels van het bij gewapende conflicten toepasselijke volkenrecht gevangen dienen te worden gehouden, toegestaan de vlucht te hervatten, en dienen passende maatregelen ten behoeve van de voortzetting van de vlucht te worden genomen. Indien de inspectie aantoont, dat het luchtvaartuig geen medisch luchtvaartuig is, wordt het opgebracht en worden de inzittenden behandeld overeenkomstig het het vierde lid.   
4.  De gewonden, zieken en schipbreukelingen die, anders dan tijdelijk, met toestemming van de plaatselijke autoriteiten een medisch luchtvaartuig hebben verlaten op het grondgebied van een neutrale Staat of een andere Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict, worden, tenzij anders tussen die Staat en de partijen bij het conflict is overeengekomen, door die Staat gevangen gehouden, indien dit door de regels van het bij gewapende conflicten toepasselijke volkenrecht wordt voorgeschreven, en wel op zodanige wijze dat zij niet opnieuw aan de vijandelijkheden kunnen deelnemen. De kosten van behandeling in een ziekenhuis en van internering dienen door de Staat waartoe die personen behoren, te worden gedragen.   
5.  De neutrale Staten en de andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict moeten alle voorwaarden en beperkingen die zij opleggen aan de vlucht van medische luchtvaartuigen over, of aan de landing van medische luchtvaartuigen op hun grondgebied, gelijkelijk op alle partijen bij het conflict toepassen.   

### SECTIE  III  

####VERMISTEN EN DODEN

### Artikel  32  

####Algemeen beginsel

Bij de uitvoering van deze Sectie zullen de werkzaamheden van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, de partijen bij het conflict en de internationale humanitaire organisaties, vermeld in de Verdragen en dit Protocol voornamelijk worden ingegeven door het recht van families, kennis te nemen van het lot van verwanten.  

### Artikel  33  

####Vermisten

1.  Zodra de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, en uiterlijk onmiddellijk na het einde van de daadwerkelijke vijandelijkheden, dient iedere partij bij het conflict naar de personen die door een tegenpartij als vermist zijn opgegeven, te zoeken. Die partij dient alle ter zake dienende gegevens betreffende die personen door te geven ten einde het zoeken te vergemakkelijken.   
2.  Ten einde het verzamelen van gegevens ingevolge het vorige lid te vergemakkelijken, dient iedere partij met betrekking tot personen die niet krachtens de Verdragen en het Protocol gunstiger mochten worden behandeld: 

(a) de gegevens te registreren, omschreven in artikel 138 van het Vierde Verdrag, betreffende die personen die langer dan twee weken gevangen zijn gehouden, gevangenisstraf hebben ondergaan of op andere wijze van hun vrijheid zijn beroofd ten gevolge van vijandelijkheden of van een bezetting, of die tijdens hun gevangenhouding zijn overleden;  

(b) het zoeken naar en het registreren van gegevens omtrent die personen zoveel mogelijk te vergemakkelijken en zo nodig zelf te verrichten, indien deze in andere omstandigheden ten gevolge van vijandelijkheden of van een bezetting zijn overleden.     
3.  Gegevens betreffende personen die ingevolge het eerste lid als vermist zijn opgegeven en verzoeken om dergelijke gegevens dienen te worden doorgegeven, hetzij rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van de beschermende mogendheid, het Centrale Opsporingsbureau van het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis of nationale Rode Kruis (Rode Halve Maan, Rode Leeuw en Zon)-organisaties. Wanneer de gegevens niet via het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis en het Centrale Opsporingsbureau daarvan worden doorgegeven, dient iedere partij bij het conflict er zorg voor te dragen, dat die gegevens tevens aan het Centrale Opsporingsbureau worden verstrekt.   
4.  De partijen bij het conflict dienen ernaar te streven, tot overeenstemming te geraken over regelingen, waardoor het ploegen mogelijk wordt gemaakt naar de doden te zoeken, deze te identificeren en uit gebieden waar gevechten hebben plaatsgevonden weg te halen, met inbegrip van regelingen waardoor het, indien wenselijk, mogelijk wordt gemaakt dat die ploegen worden vergezeld door personeel van de tegenpartij wanneer zij hun taak vervullen in gebieden die door de tegenpartij worden beheerst. Het personeel van die ploegendienst dient, wanneer het uitsluitend de genoemde functie vervult, te worden ontzien en beschermd.   

### Artikel  34  

####Stoffelijke overschotten

1.  Het stoffelijk overschot van personen die zijn overleden door oorzaken verband houdende met een bezetting, of die zijn overleden tijdens gevangenhouding voortkomend uit een bezetting of uit vijandelijkheden, alsook het stoffelijk overschot van personen die geen onderdaan zijn van het land waar zij zijn overleden ten gevolge van vijandelijkheden, dienen te worden ontzien, en het graf van alle zodanige personen dient te worden ontzien, onderhouden en aangeduid, als bepaald in artikel 130 van het Vierde Verdrag, wanneer het stoffelijk overschot of graf geen gunstiger behandeling krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol mocht ontvangen.   
2.  Zodra de omstandigheden en de betrekkingen tussen de tegenpartijen dat toelaten, moeten de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen op wier grondgebied graven zijn gelegen van personen die ten gevolge van vijandelijkheden of tijdens een bezetting of gevangenhouding zijn overleden of, in voorkomende gevallen, andere plaatsen waar zich stoffelijke overschotten van zodanige personen bevinden, overeenkomsten sluiten ten einde: 

(a) de toegang tot de graven te vergemakkelijken voor de familieleden van de overledenen en de vertegenwoordigers van de officiële gravendiensten, en regelingen van praktische aard voor die toegang vast te stellen;  

(b) dergelijke graven duurzaam te beschermen en te ontzien;  

(c) de terugkeer te vergemakkelijken van het stoffelijk overschot en de persoonlijke bezittingen van de overledenen naar het land van herkomst, op verzoek van dat land of op verzoek van de naaste familieleden, tenzij het bedoelde land daartegen bezwaar maakt.     
3.  Indien geen overeenkomsten als voorzien in het tweede lid, letters b of c, zijn gesloten en indien het land van herkomst van deze overledenen niet bereid is op zijn kosten voor het onderhoud van die graven zorg te dragen, kan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij op wier grondgebied de graven zijn gelegen aanbieden, maatregelen te treffen ter vergemakkelijking van de terugkeer van de stoffelijke overschotten van de overledenen naar het land van herkomst. Indien een dergelijk aanbod niet wordt aanvaard, kan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij na verloop van vijf jaar, te rekenen vanaf de dag van het aanbod en na kennisgeving aan het land van herkomst, de voorschriften, neergelegd in haar eigen wetgeving met betrekking tot begraafplaatsen en graven, toepassen.   
4.  Het is een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, op wier grondgebied de graven bedoeld in dit artikel zijn gelegen, slechts toegestaan de stoffelijke overschotten op te graven: 

(a) in overeenstemming met het tweede lid, letter c, en het derde lid, of  

(b) wanneer opgraving dwingend is geboden door het algemeen belang, waaronder begrepen medische noodzaak en noodzaak verband houdende met de opsporing, in welk geval de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij te allen tijde de stoffelijke overschotten dient te ontzien en het land van herkomst in kennis dient te stellen van haar voornemen de stoffelijke overschotten op te graven, waarbij zij bijzonderheden betreffende de voorgenomen plaats van herbegrafenis dient te vermelden.

####METHODEN EN MIDDELEN VAN OORLOGVOERING

### Artikel  35  

####Grondregels

1.  In geen enkel gewapend conflict is het recht van de partijen bij het conflict ten aanzien van de keuze der methoden of middelen van oorlogvoering onbegrensd.   
2.  Het is verboden wapens, projectielen en stoffen alsmede methoden van oorlogvoering te gebruiken, die naar hun aard overbodig letsel of onnodig leed veroorzaken.   
3.  Het is verboden, methoden of middelen van oorlogvoering te gebruiken, bestemd om omvangrijke, langdurige en ernstige schade aan het natuurlijk milieu toe te brengen, of die dergelijke schade, naar kan worden verwacht, zullen toebrengen.   

### Artikel  36  

####Nieuwe wapens

Op een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij rust bij de bestudering, ontwikkeling, aanschaf of invoering van een nieuw wapen, een nieuw middel of een nieuwe methode van oorlogvoering de verplichting, vast te stellen of het gebruik daarvan, in bepaalde of in alle omstandigheden, door dit Protocol of door enige andere regel van het ten aanzien van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij toepasselijke volkenrecht is verboden.  

### Artikel  37  

####Verbod van perfidie

1.  Het is verboden een tegenstander te doden, te verwonden of gevangen te nemen door middel van perfidie. Gedragingen die het vertrouwen wekken bij een tegenstander ten einde deze te doen geloven dat hij gerechtigd is tot bescherming krachtens de regels van het volkenrecht toepasselijk in geval van gewapende conflicten of dat hij verplicht is zodanige bescherming te verlenen, met de bedoeling dat vertrouwen te misbruiken, leveren perfidie op. Voorbeelden van perfidie zijn: 

(a) het voorwenden van het voornemen tot onderhandelen onder de parlementaire vlag of het voorwenden van overgave;  

(b) het voorwenden, uitgeschakeld te zijn door verwondingen of ziekte;  

(c) het voorwenden van het bezit van de status van burger of van non-combattant;  

(d) het voorwenden van het bezit van een beschermde positie door het gebruik van tekens, kentekenen of uniformen van de Verenigde Naties, van neutrale Staten of van andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict.     
2.  Krijgslisten zijn niet verboden. Dergelijke listen zijn gedragingen die zijn bedoeld om een tegenstander te misleiden of hem er toe te bewegen roekeloos te handelen, maar die geen regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in geval van gewapende conflicten schenden, en die niet verraderlijk zijn doordat niet wordt getracht het vertrouwen van een tegenstander te wekken met betrekking tot bescherming krachtens dat recht. Voorbeelden van krijgslisten zijn: het gebruik van camouflage, lokmiddelen, schijnoperaties en onjuiste inlichtingen.   

### Artikel  38  

####Erkende kentekenen

1.  Het is verboden ongepast gebruik te maken van het kenteken van het Rode Kruis, de Rode Halve Maan of de Rode Leeuw en Zon, of van andere kentekenen, tekens of seinen, als voorzien in de Verdragen of dit Protocol. Het is eveneens verboden, in een gewapend conflict opzettelijk misbruik te maken van andere internationaal erkende beschermende kentekenen, tekens of seinen, daaronder begrepen de parlementaire vlag en het beschermende kenteken van culturele goederen.   
2.  Het is verboden gebruik te maken van het kenteken van de Verenigde Naties, behalve wanneer het gebruik door die Organisatie is toegestaan.   

### Artikel  39  

####Nationaliteitskenteken

1.  Het is verboden in een gewapend conflict gebruik te maken van de vlaggen of de militaire kentekenen, onderscheidingstekens of uniformen van neutrale Staten of andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict.   
2.  Het is verboden gebruik te maken van de vlaggen of militaire kentekenen, onderscheidingstekens of uniformen van de tegenpartijen tijdens aanvallen of met het oogmerk militaire operaties te dekken, te begunstigen, te beschermen of te belemmeren.   
3.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel of van artikel 37, eerste lid, letter d, vormt een aantasting van de bestaande, algemeen erkende regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in geval van spionage of het gebruik van vlaggen tijdens gewapende conflicten op zee.   

### Artikel  40  

####Kwartier

Het is verboden het bevel te geven dat niemand mag overleven, een tegenstander daarmee te dreigen of op die grondslag de vijandelijkheden te bedrijven.  

### Artikel  41  

####Bescherming van een vijand builen gevecht

1.  Een persoon die, naar wordt onderkend, of in de gegeven omstandigheden zou moeten worden onderkend, buiten gevecht verkeert, mag niet het doelwit van een aanval worden gemaakt.   
2.  Een persoon verkeert buiten gevecht indien: 

(a) hij zich in de macht van een tegenpartij bevindt;  

(b) hij duidelijk het voornemen te kennen geeft, zich over te geven; of  

(c) hij het bewustzijn heeft verloren of op andere wijze door verwondingen of ziekte is uitgeschakeld, en daarom niet in staat is zich te verdedigen,   mits hij zich in alle genoemde gevallen onthoudt van iedere vijandelijke handeling en niet tracht te ontvluchten.   
3.  Wanneer personen die aanspraak kunnen maken op bescherming als krijgsgevangene, in handen van een tegenpartij zijn gevallen onder ongebruikelijke gevechtsomstandigheden die hun evacuatie, als geregeld in Deel III, Sectie I, van het Derde Verdrag verhinderen, dienen zij te worden vrijgelaten en dienen alle voorzorgen die praktisch uitvoerbaar zijn te worden getroffen om hun veiligheid te waarborgen.   

### Artikel  42  

####Inzittenden van luchtvaartuigen

1.  Niemand die met een parachute uit een vliegtuig in nood springt, mag gedurende zijn neerdaling het doelwit van een aanval worden gemaakt.   
2.  Aan een persoon die met een parachute uit een vliegtuig in nood is gesprongen dient, zodra hij bij zijn landing terecht komt op gebied dat door een tegenpartij wordt beheerst, de gelegenheid te worden geboden zich over te geven, voordat hij het doelwit van een aanval wordt gemaakt, tenzij het duidelijk is dat hij een vijandelijke handeling verricht.   
3.  Luchtlandingstroepen worden niet door dit artikel beschermd.   

### SECTIE  II  

####DE STATUS VAN COMBATTANT EN VAN KRIJGSGEVANGENE

### Artikel  43  

####De strijdkrachten

1.  De strijdkrachten van een partij bij een conflict bestaan uit alle georganiseerde strijdkrachten, groepen en eenheden die onder een bevel staan dat tegenover die partij verantwoordelijk is voor het gedrag van zijn ondergeschikten, zelfs indien die partij wordt vertegenwoordigd door een niet door een tegenpartij erkende regering of autoriteit. Deze strijdkrachten dienen te zijn onderworpen aan een intern krijgstuchtelijk systeem, dat onder andere de nakoming van de regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in geval van gewapende conflicten, dient te verzekeren.   
2.  De leden van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij een conflict, die niet zijn medisch personeel of geestelijke verzorgers op wie artikel 33 van het Derde Verdrag betrekking heeft, zijn combattanten en hebben derhalve het recht om rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deel te nemen.   
3.  Wanneer een partij bij het conflict een paramilitaire organisatie, of een gewapende dienst belast met politietaken, in zijn strijdkrachten opneemt, moet zij de andere partijen bij het conflict daarvan in kennis stellen.   

### Artikel  44  

####Combattanten en krijgsgevangenen

1.  Iedere combattant, als omschreven in artikel 43, die in handen van een tegenpartij valt wordt als krijgsgevangene beschouwd.   
2.  Alle combattanten zijn verplicht de regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in gewapende conflicten, in acht te nemen; schendingen van die regels ontnemen evenwel een combattant niet het recht om als combattant te worden beschouwd of, indien hij in handen van een tegenpartij valt, het recht om als krijgsgevangene te worden beschouwd, behalve in de gevallen als voorzien in het derde en het vierde lid.   
3.  Ter bevordering van een bescherming van de burgerbevolking tegen de gevolgen van de vijandelijkheden, zijn de combattanten verplicht zich van de burgerbevolking te onderscheiden wanneer zij een aanval of een militaire operatie ter voorbereiding van een aanval uitvoeren. Gelet evenwel op het feit dat er zich in een gewapend conflict situaties voordoen, waarin het een gewapende combattant door de aard van de vijandelijkheden niet mogelijk is zich van de burgerbevolking te onderscheiden, behoudt deze zijn status van combattant, mits hij in zulke situaties zijn wapens openlijk draagt: 

(a) gedurende ieder militair treffen, en  

(b) gedurende de tijd dat hij zichtbaar is voor de tegenpartij bij het betrekken van militaire posities, voorafgaande aan het inzetten van een aanval waaraan hij moet deelnemen.   Handelingen die voldoen aan de in dit lid neergelegde vereisten worden niet als perfide in de zin van artikel 37, eerste lid, letter c, beschouwd.   
4.  Een combattant die in handen van een tegenpartij valt terwijl hij niet aan de vereisten, neergelegd in de tweede zin van het derde lid, voldoet, verliest het recht om als krijgsgevangene te worden beschouwd, maar hem dient niettemin bescherming te worden verleend die in alle opzichten gelijkwaardig is aan die welke het Derde Verdrag en dit Protocol aan krijgsgevangenen toekennen. Deze bescherming omvat mede bescherming die gelijkwaardig moet zijn aan die welke het Derde Verdrag aan krijgsgevangenen toekent, ingeval een zodanige persoon wordt berecht en gestraft voor enig strafbaar feit dat hij heeft begaan.   
5.  Geen enkele combattant die in handen van een tegenpartij valt, zonder dat hij op dat moment deelneemt aan een aanval of een militaire operatie ter voorbereiding van een aanval, verliest uit hoofde van zijn voorafgaande activiteiten het recht als combattant en als krijgsgevangene te worden beschouwd.   
6.  Dit artikel laat onverlet het recht van enige persoon om krachtens artikel 4 van het Derde Verdrag als krijgsgevangene te worden beschouwd.   
7.  Dit artikel heeft niet ten doel, verandering te brengen in de algemeen aanvaarde statenpraktijk met betrekking tot het dragen van het uniform door de combattanten die behoren tot de geregelde geüniformeerde gewapende eenheden van een partij bij het conflict.   
8.  Naast de categorieën personen, vermeld in de artikelen 13 van het Eerste en het Tweede Verdrag, kunnen alle leden van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict, als omschreven in artikel 43 van dit Protocol, aanspraak maken op bescherming krachtens die Verdragen, indien zij gewond of ziek zijn of, in het geval van het Tweede Verdrag, op zee of in andere wateren schipbreuk hebben geleden.   

### Artikel  45  

####Bescherming van de personen die aan de vijandelijkheden hebben deelgenomen

1.  Een persoon die aan vijandelijkheden deelneemt en in handen van een tegenpartij valt, wordt geacht krijgsgevangene te zijn en dient derhalve door het Derde Verdrag te worden beschermd, indien hij de status van krijgsgevangene inroept, indien blijkt dat hij aanspraak op een zodanige status heeft of indien de partij waartoe hij behoort een zodanige status te zijnen gunste inroept door middel van een kennisgeving aan de gevangenhoudende of aan de beschermende mogendheid. Indien er enige twijfel mocht rijzen over de vraag, of een zodanige persoon aanspraak op de status van krijgsgevangene heeft, dient hij die status te behouden en derhalve door het Derde Verdrag en dit Protocol te worden beschermd, totdat zijn status door een bevoegde rechterlijke instantie is vastgesteld.   
2.  Indien een persoon die in handen van een tegenpartij is gevallen, niet als krijgsgevangene wordt vastgehouden, en door die partij zal worden berecht wegens een strafbaar feit, verband houdende met de vijandelijkheden, dient hij het recht te hebben om zijn aanspraak op de status van krijgsgevangene voor een rechterlijke instantie geldend te maken en een uitspraak betreffende die kwestie te verkrijgen. Steeds wanneer dat krachtens de toepasselijke procesregels mogelijk is, dient die uitspraak te worden gedaan voorafgaand aan het proces met betrekking tot het strafbare feit. De vertegenwoordigers van de beschermende mogendheid hebben het recht, het proces waarin betreffende de bovenbedoelde kwestie uitspraak wordt gedaan, bij te wonen, behalve in uitzonderlijke gevallen waarin het proces in het belang van de veiligheid van de Staat achter gesloten deuren wordt gevoerd. In een dergelijk geval moet de gevangenhoudende mogendheid de beschermende mogendheid daarvan in kennis stellen.   
3.  Ieder die heeft deelgenomen aan vijandelijkheden, die geen aanspraak heeft op de status van krijgsgevangene en die geen gunstiger behandeling krachtens het Vierde Verdrag geniet, dient te allen tijde recht te hebben op de bescherming, verleend door artikel 75 van dit Protocol. In bezet gebied heeft iedere zodanige persoon, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 5 van het Vierde Verdrag, eveneens aanspraak op het recht van communicatie krachtens dat Verdrag, behalve wanneer hij als spion wordt vastgehouden.   

### Artikel  46  

####Spionnen

1.  Niettegenstaande enige andere bepaling van de Verdragen of dit Protocol heeft een lid van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict, die in handen van een tegenpartij valt terwijl hij spionage bedrijft, geen recht op de status van krijgsgevangene, en kan als spion worden behandeld.   
2.  Een lid van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict die, ten behoeve van die partij en op gebied dat door een tegenpartij wordt beheerst, inlichtingen verzamelt of tracht te verzamelen, wordt niet geacht spionage te bedrijven indien hij, terwijl hij zodanige handelingen verricht, het uniform draagt van de strijdkrachten waartoe hij behoort.   
3.  Een lid van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict, die inwoner is van een door een tegenpartij bezet gebied en die, ten behoeve van de partij waartoe hij behoort inlichtingen van militair belang binnen dat grondgebied verzamelt of tracht te verzamelen, wordt niet geacht spionage te bedrijven, tenzij hij zulks onder valse voorwendsels of opzettelijk op heimelijke wijze doet. Bovendien verliest zo'n inwoner zijn recht op de status van krijgsgevangene niet en mag niet als spion worden behandeld, tenzij hij wordt gevat terwijl hij spionage bedrijft.   
4.  Een lid van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict, die geen inwoner is van door een tegenpartij bezet gebied en die op dat gebied spionage heeft bedreven, verliest zijn recht op de status van krijgsgevangene niet en mag niet worden behandeld als spion, tenzij hij wordt gevat voordat hij zich weer bij de strijdkrachten waartoe hij behoort, heeft gevoegd.   

### Artikel  47  

####Huurlingen

1.  Een huurling heeft niet het recht op de status van combattant of van krijgsgevangene.   
2.  Een huurling is iedere persoon: 

(a) die plaatselijk of in het buitenland speciaal is aangeworven om te vechten in een gewapend conflict;  

(b) die daadwerkelijk en rechtstreeks deelneemt aan de vijandelijkheden;  

(c) die voornamelijk door het verlangen naar persoonlijk gewin wordt gedreven aan de vijandelijkheden deel te nemen en aan wie daadwerkelijk door of vanwege een partij bij het conflict een materiële vergoeding is beloofd die de aan combattanten van gelijke rang en functie bij de strijdkrachten van die partij beloofde of betaalde vergoeding aanzienlijk te boven gaat;  

(d) die geen onderdaan is van een partij bij het conflict, noch inwoner van door een partij bij het conflict beheerst gebied;  

(e) die geen lid is van de strijdkrachten van een partij bij het conflict; en  

(f) die niet door een Staat die geen partij is bij het conflict met een officiële opdracht, als lid van de strijdkrachten van die Staat, is uitgezonden.     

### DEEL  IV  

####BURGERBEVOLKING

### SECTIE  I  

####ALGEMENE BESCHERMING TEGEN DE GEVOLGEN VAN DE VIJANDELIJKHEDEN

### Hoofdstuk  I  

####GRONDREGEL EN TOEPASSINGSGEBIED

### Artikel  48  

####Grondregel

Ten einde te verzekeren, dat de burgerbevolking en de burgerobjecten worden ontzien en beschermd, dienen de partijen bij het conflict te allen tijde onderscheid te maken tussen de burgerbevolking en combattanten en tussen burgerobjecten en militaire doelen en dienen zij derhalve hun operaties uitsluitend tegen militaire doelen te richten.  

### Artikel  49  

####Definitie van aanvallen en toepassingsgebied

1.  „Aanvallen” betekent: daden van geweld gericht tegen de tegenstander, hetzij offensieve hetzij defensieve.   
2.  De bepalingen van dit Protocol met betrekking tot aanvallen zijn van toepassing op alle aanvallen, op welk gebied ook uitgevoerd, met inbegrip van nationaal grondgebied dat aan een partij bij het conflict toebehoort maar door een tegenstander wordt beheerst.   
3.  De bepalingen van deze Sectie zijn van toepassing op alle krijgsverrichtingen te land, in de lucht of ter zee die de burgerbevolking, de individuele burgers of burgerobjecten te land kunnen treffen. Zij zijn voorts van toepassing op alle aanvallen vanuit zee of uit de lucht op doelen op het land, maar laten overigens de regels van het volkenrecht, van toepassing bij gewapende conflicten ter zee of in de lucht, onverlet.   
4.  De bepalingen van deze Sectie vormen een aanvulling op de regels betreffende de humanitaire bescherming, neergelegd in het Vierde Verdrag, in het bijzonder in Deel II daarvan, en in andere voor de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen bindende internationale overeenkomsten, evenals op andere regels van het volkenrecht betreffende de bescherming van burgers en burgerobjecten te land, ter zee of in de lucht tegen de gevolgen van vijandelijkheden.   

### Hoofdstuk  II  

####BURGERS EN BURGERBEVOLKING

### Artikel  50  

####Definitie van burgers en burgerbevolking

1.  Burger is ieder die niet behoort tot een van de categorieën personen, bedoeld in artikel 4, letter A, 1, 2, 3 en 6 van het Derde Verdrag en in artikel 43 van dit Protocol. Bij twijfel of iemand burger is, wordt hij als burger beschouwd.   
2.  De burgerbevolking omvat alle personen die burgers zijn.   
3.  De aanwezigheid onder de burgerbevolking van personen die niet onder de definitie van burgers vallen, ontneemt haar de civiele hoedanigheid niet.   

### Artikel  51  

####Bescherming van de burgerbevolking

1.  De burgerbevolking en de afzonderlijke burgers genieten algemene bescherming tegen uit militaire operaties voortvloeiende gevaren. Om deze bescherming te verwezenlijken dienen de volgende regels, die een aanvulling vormen op de andere van toepassing zijnde regels van het volkenrecht, onder alle omstandigheden in acht te worden genomen.   
2.  Noch de burgerbevolking als zodanig, noch de afzonderlijke burgers mogen het doelwit van een aanval vormen. Daden van geweld of bedreiging met geweld, waarvan het belangrijkste oogmerk is de burgerbevolking angst aan te jagen, zijn verboden.   
3.  De burgers genieten de in deze Sectie verleende bescherming, behalve indien en zolang zij rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deelnemen.   
4.  Niet-onderscheidende aanvallen zijn verboden. Niet-onderscheidende aanvallen zijn: 

(a) aanvallen die niet op een bepaald militair doel zijn gericht;  

(b) aanvallen waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van strijdmiddelen of -methoden die niet op een bepaald militair doel kunnen worden gericht; of  

(c) aanvallen waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van strijdmiddelen of -methoden waarvan de gevolgen niet kunnen worden beperkt zoals dit Protocol vereist;   en die derhalve in alle genoemde gevallen naar hun aard, militaire doelen en burgers of burgerobjecten zonder onderscheid kunnen treffen.   
5.  De volgende soorten aanvallen dienen onder andere als niet-onderscheidend te worden beschouwd: 

(a) aanvallen door middel van een bombardement, met welke middelen en methoden dan ook, waarbij een aantal duidelijk gescheiden en als zodanig te onderscheiden militaire doelen, gelegen in een stad, dorp of andere streek waarin zich een vergelijkbare concentratie burgers of burgerobjecten bevindt, worden aangemerkt als één enkel militair doel; en  

(b) aanvallen die, naar kan worden verwacht bijkomend verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking, verwonding van burgers, schade aan burgerobjecten of een combinatie daarvan ten gevolge zullen hebben, in een mate die buitensporig zou zijn in verhouding tot het verwachte tastbare en rechtstreekse militaire voordeel.     
6.  Aanvallen op de burgerbevolking of burgers bij wijze van represaille zijn verboden.   
7.  De aanwezigheid of de bewegingen van de burgerbevolking of van afzonderlijke burgers mogen niet worden gebruikt om bepaalde plaatsen of gebieden te vrijwaren voor militaire operaties, in het bijzonder niet wanneer daarbij wordt getracht militaire doelen tegen aanvallen af te schermen of militaire operaties te dekken, te begunstigen of te belemmeren. De partijen bij het conflict mogen de bewegingen van de burgerbevolking of van afzonderlijke burgers niet in een bepaalde richting leiden ten einde te trachten militaire doelen tegen aanvallen af te schermen of militaire operaties te dekken.   
8.  Geen enkele overtreding van deze verboden ontslaat de partijen bij het conflict van hun juridische verplichtingen met betrekking tot de burgerbevolking en de burgers, daaronder begrepen de verplichting om de in artikel 57 voorziene voorzorgsmaatregel te treffen.   

### Hoofdstuk  III  

####BURGEROBJECTEN

### Artikel  52  

####Algemene bescherming van burgerobjecten

1.  Burgerobjecten mogen niet het doelwit van een aanval worden en tegen die objecten mogen geen represailles worden genomen. Burgerobjecten zijn alle objecten die geen militaire doelen als omschreven in het tweede lid, zijn.   
2.  Aanvallen dienen strikt tot militaire doelen te worden beperkt. Voor zover het objecten betreft, zijn militaire doelen uitsluitend die objecten die naar hun aard, ligging, bestemming of gebruik een daadwerkelijke bijdrage tot de krijgsverrichtingen leveren en waarvan de gehele of gedeeltelijke vernietiging, verovering of onbruikbaarmaking onder de omstandigheden van dat moment een duidelijk militair voordeel oplevert.   
3.  In geval van twijfel of een object dat gewoonlijk dienst doet voor civiele doeleinden, zoals plaatsen van godsdienstige verering, een huis of ander soort woning of een school, wordt gebruikt om een daadwerkelijke bijdrage te leveren aan de krijgsverrichtingen, dient ervan te worden uitgegaan dat het niet voor het laatst genoemd doel wordt gebruikt.   

### Artikel  53  

####Bescherming van culturele goederen en plaatsen van godsdienstige verering

Onverminderd de bepalingen van het Verdrag van 's-Gravenhage inzake de bescherming van culturele goederen in geval van een gewapend conflict van 14 mei 1954 en van andere op deze bescherming betrekking hebbende internationale akten, is het verboden: 

(a) vijandelijke handelingen te verrichten, gericht tegen de historische monumenten, de kunstwerken of plaatsen van godsdienstige verering die het culturele of geestelijke erfgoed van de volkeren vormen;  

(b) dergelijke goederen te gebruiken ter ondersteuning van de militaire inspanning;  

(c) represailles tegen dergelijke goederen te nemen.    

### Artikel  54  

####Bescherming van voor het overleven van de burgerbevolking onmisbare objecten

1.  Het uithongeren van burgers als methode van oorlogsvoering is verboden.   
2.  De volgende daden zijn verboden: het aanvallen, vernietigen, weghalen of onbruikbaar maken van voor het overleven van de burgerbevolking onmisbare objecten, zoals voedingsmiddelen, landbouwgebieden waar voedingsmiddelen worden geproduceerd, oogsten, vee, drinkwaterinstallaties en -voorraden en bevloeiingswerken, met het oogmerk om, wegens de waarde welke die objecten voor het levensonderhoud hebben, de burgerbevolking of de tegenpartij daarvan te beroven, ongeacht of de beweegreden van een dergelijke daad is de burgers uit te hongeren, hen ertoe te bewegen weg te trekken, of welke andere beweegreden ook.   
3.  De verboden, neergelegd in het tweede lid, zijn niet van toepassing op de daarin bedoelde objecten die door een tegenpartij worden gebruikt: 

(a) uitsluitend voor het levensonderhoud van de leden van haar strijdkrachten; of  

(b) indien niet voor het levensonderhoud, dan toch als rechtstreekse ondersteuning van krijgsverrichtingen, mits evenwel in geen geval handelingen tegen die objecten worden ondernomen, waardoor naar kan worden verwacht voor de burgerbevolking zo weinig voedsel of water zou overblijven dat zij zou verhongeren of worden gedwongen weg te trekken.     
4.  Tegen deze objecten mogen geen represailles worden genomen.   
5.  Gelet op het levensbelang dat iedere partij bij het conflict heeft bij de verdediging van haar grondgebied tegen invallen, mag zij binnen dat gebied, voor zover dat door haarzelf wordt beheerst, van de in het tweede lid neergelegde verboden afwijken, wanneer dat wegens dwingende militaire noodzaak is geboden.   

### Artikel  55  

####Bescherming van het natuurlijk milieu

1.  Bij de krijgsverrichtingen moet ervoor worden gewaakt, dat het natuurlijk milieu tegen omvangrijke, langdurige en ernstige schade wordt beschermd. Deze bescherming omvat mede het verbod van het gebruik van strijdmiddelen en -methoden die zijn bestemd om zodanige schade aan het natuurlijk milieu toe te brengen dat daardoor de gezondheid of de overleving van de burgerbevolking in gevaar wordt gebracht, of dat dergelijke schade naar kan worden verwacht, zal worden toegebracht.   
2.  Aanvallen gericht tegen het natuurlijk milieu bij wijze van represaille zijn verboden.   

### Artikel  56  

####Bescherming van werken en installaties die gevaarlijke krachten bevatten

1.  Werken of installaties die gevaarlijke krachten bevatten, te weten stuwdammen, dijken en kerncentrales, mogen niet het doelwit van een aanval worden gemaakt, zelfs niet wanneer zij militaire doelen zijn indien die aanvallen het vrijkomen van gevaarlijke krachten zouden veroorzaken en daardoor zware verliezen aan mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking teweeg zouden brengen. Andere militaire doelen gelegen op of in de nabijheid van die werken of installaties, mogen niet het doelwit van een aanval worden gemaakt indien die aanvallen het vrijkomen van gevaarlijke krachten uit die werken of installaties zouden veroorzaken en daardoor zware verliezen aan mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking teweeg zouden brengen.   
2.  De in het eerste lid voorziene bijzondere bescherming tegen aanvallen eindigt: 

(a) wat stuwdammen of dijken betreft, alleen indien deze worden gebruikt voor andere dan hun gebruikelijke bestemming en voor geregelde, aanzienlijke en rechtstreekse ondersteuning van de militaire operaties, en indien die aanvallen het enige praktisch uitvoerbare middel vormen om die ondersteuning te beëindigen;  

(b) wat kerncentrales betreft, alleen indien deze elektrische energie leveren voor geregelde, aanzienlijke en rechtstreekse ondersteuning van de militaire operaties, en indien die aanvallen het enige praktisch uitvoerbare middel vormen om die ondersteuning te beëindigen;  

(c) wat de andere militaire doelen, gelegen op of in de nabijheid van die werken of installaties betreft, alleen indien deze worden gebruikt voor geregelde, aanzienlijke en rechtstreekse ondersteuning van de militaire operaties, en indien die aanvallen het enige praktisch uitvoerbare middel vormen om die ondersteuning te beëindigen.     
3.  In alle gevallen kan de burgerbevolking en kunnen de individuele burgers blijvend aanspraak maken op de volledige bescherming, hun door het volkenrecht verleend, met inbegrip van de bescherming, voortvloeiende uit de in artikel 57 voorziene voorzorgsmaatregelen. Indien de bescherming eindigt en een van de in het eerste lid vermelde werken, installaties of militaire doelen wordt aangevallen, moeten alle praktisch uitvoerbare maatregelen worden genomen om het vrijkomen van de gevaarlijke krachten te verhinderen.   
4.  Het is verboden represailles te nemen tegen de in het eerste lid vermelde werken, installaties of militaire doelen.   
5.  De partijen bij het conflict moeten trachten te vermijden, militaire doelen in de nabijheid van de in het eerste lid vermelde werken of installaties te plaatsen. Niettemin zijn installaties, gebouwd met het uitsluitende doel de beschermde werken of installaties tegen aanvallen te verdedigen, toegestaan en mogen deze zelf geen doelwit van een aanval worden gemaakt, mits zij niet worden gebruikt bij de vijandelijkheden, behalve voor defensieve handelingen die noodzakelijk zijn om aanvallen op de beschermde werken of installaties te beantwoorden, en mits hun bewapening is beperkt tot wapens die slechts geschikt zijn om een vijandelijke actie tegen de beschermde werken of installaties af te weren.   
6.  Aan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en de partijen bij het conflict wordt dringend verzocht, onderling nadere overeenkomsten te sluiten om objecten die gevaarlijke krachten bevatten, aanvullende bescherming te verschaffen.   
7.  Ten einde de herkenbaarheid van de door dit artikel beschermde objecten te bevorderen, kunnen de partijen bij het conflict deze voorzien van een bijzonder kenteken, bestaande uit een groep van drie feloranje, op één as geplaatste cirkels, als aangegeven in artikel 16 van Bijlage I bij dit Protocol. De afwezigheid van een zodanige aanduiding ontheft geen enkele partij bij het conflict in enig opzicht van haar verplichtingen krachtens dit artikel.   

### Hoofdstuk  IV  

####VOORZORGSMAATREGELEN

### Artikel  57  

####Voorzorgen bij aanvallen

1.  Bij het uitvoeren van de militaire operaties moet er voortdurend voor worden gewaakt, dat de burgerbevolking, de burgers en de burgerobjecten worden ontzien.   
2.  Met betrekking tot aanvallen dienen de volgende voorzorgen te worden genomen: 

(a) zij die een aanval voorbereiden of tot een aanval besluiten dienen: 

(i) al het praktisch uitvoerbare te doen om zich ervan te vergewissen, dat de aan te vallen doelen geen burgers of burgerobjecten zijn en geen bijzondere bescherming genieten, maar militaire doelen vormen in de zin van artikel 52, tweede lid, en dat de bepalingen van dit Protocol niet verbieden deze aan te vallen;  

(ii) alle praktisch uitvoerbare voorzorgen te nemen bij de keuze van de middelen en methoden voor de aanval, ten einde bijkomend verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking, verwonding van burgers en schade aan burgerobjecten te voorkomen en deze in elk geval tot het uiterste te beperken;  

(iii) af te zien van enige aanval die naar kan worden verwacht mede bijkomend verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking, verwonding van burgers, schade aan burgerobjecten of een combinatie daarvan zal veroorzaken, in een mate welke buitensporig zou zijn in verhouding tot het te verwachten tastbare en rechtstreekse militaire voordeel;    

(b) een aanval dient te worden afgelast of opgeschort, wanneer blijkt dat het doel geen militair doel is of een bijzondere bescherming geniet, of wanneer blijkt dat de aanval naar kan worden verwacht mede bijkomend verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking, verwonding van burgers, schade aan burgerobjecten of een combinatie daarvan zou veroorzaken, in een mate welke buitensporig zou zijn in verhouding tot het te verwachten tastbare en rechtstreekse militaire voordeel;  

(c) omtrent aanvallen die ook de burgerbevolking zouden kunnen treffen, dient op effectieve wijze vooraf een waarschuwing te worden gegeven, tenzij de omstandigheden dat niet toelaten.     
3.  Wanneer een keuze mogelijk is tussen verschillende militaire doelen om een gelijkwaardig militair voordeel te behalen, dient dat doel te worden uitgekozen, waarop de aanval naar kan worden verwacht het minste gevaar voor de levens van de burgerbevolking en voor de burgerobjecten oplevert.   
4.  Bij het uitvoeren van militaire operaties ter zee of in de lucht dient elke partij bij het conflict, in overeenstemming met haar rechten en verplichtingen krachtens de regels van volkenrecht, toepasselijk in gewapende conflicten alle redelijke voorzorgen te nemen om verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking en schade aan burgerobjecten te voorkomen.   
5.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel mag worden uitgelegd als machtiging tot enige aanval op de burgerbevolking, burgers of burgerobjecten.   

### Artikel  58  

####Voorzorgen tegen de gevolgen van aanvallen

De partijen bij het conflict dienen voor zover dat ook maar enigszins praktisch uitvoerbaar is: 

(a) onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 49 van het Vierde Verdrag, te trachten de burgerbevolking, de individuele burgers en de burgerobjecten onder hun gezag uit de nabijheid van militaire doelen te verwijderen;  

(b) te vermijden, militaire doelen in of nabij dichtbevolkte gebieden te plaatsen;  

(c) alle andere noodzakelijke voorzorgen te nemen om de burgerbevolking, de individuele burgers en de burgerobjecten onder hun gezag tegen de uit de militaire operaties voortvloeiende gevaren te beschermen.    

### Hoofdstuk  V  

####PLAATSEN EN ZONES ONDER SPECIALE BESCHERMING

### Artikel  59  

####Onverdedigde plaatsen

1.  Het is de partijen bij het conflict verboden, met welke middelen ook, onverdedigde plaatsen aan te vallen.   
2.  De ter zake bevoegde autoriteiten van een partij bij het conflict kunnen iedere bewoonde plaats gelegen in de nabijheid van of in een zone, waar de strijdkrachten contact gemaakt hebben en welke gemakkelijk door een tegenpartij kan worden bezet, tot onverdedigde plaats verklaren. Een zodanige plaats dient aan de volgende voorwaarden te voldoen: 

(a) alle combattanten, evenals de mobiele wapens en de mobiele militaire uitrusting moeten zijn verwijderd;  

(b) vaste militaire installaties of inrichtingen mogen niet voor vijandelijke doeleinden worden gebruikt;  

(c) de autoriteiten of de bevolking mogen geen vijandelijke daden verrichten; en  

(d) er mogen geen activiteiten ter ondersteuning van de militaire operaties worden ondernomen.     
3.  De aanwezigheid op deze plaats van personen die bijzondere bescherming krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol genieten, en van politie die de opdracht heeft gekregen om daar te blijven uitsluitend om de orde te handhaven, is niet in strijd met de in het tweede lid vervatte voorwaarden.   
4.  De verklaring, gedaan krachtens het tweede lid, dient te worden gericht tot de tegenpartij en dient zo precies mogelijk de grenzen van de onverdedigde plaats vast te stellen en te beschrijven. De partij bij het conflict, tot welke de verklaring is gericht, dient de ontvangst ervan te bevestigen en de plaats als onverdedigde plaats aan te merken, tenzij in feite niet is voldaan aan de in het tweede lid vervatte voorwaarden, in welk geval zij de partij, die de verklaring heeft afgelegd, daarvan onverwijld in kennis dient te stellen. Ook indien niet is voldaan aan de in het tweede lid vervatte voorwaarden blijft de plaats de bescherming genieten die wordt verleend door de andere bepalingen van dit Protocol en de andere regels van het Volkenrecht, toepasselijk in gewapende conflicten.   
5.  De partijen bij het conflict kunnen onderling overeenkomsten sluiten betreffende het in het leven roepen van onverdedigde plaatsen, ook indien dergelijke plaatsen niet voldoen aan de in het tweede lid vervatte voorwaarden. De overeenkomst dient zo precies mogelijk de grenzen van de onverdedigde plaats te om- en te beschrijven; zo nodig kan zij bepalingen omtrent de wijze van toezicht inhouden.   
6.  De partij die een plaats beheerst, welke onderwerp van een zodanige overeenkomst vormt, dient haar zoveel mogelijk van met de andere partij overeengekomen kentekenen te voorzien; deze kentekenen dienen zodanig te worden geplaatst dat zij duidelijk zichtbaar zijn, in het bijzonder bij de omtrek en de grenzen en aan de hoofdwegen.   
7.  Een plaats verliest haar status van onverdedigde plaats, wanneer zij niet meer voldoet aan de voorwaarden die zijn neergelegd in het tweede lid of in de overeenkomst, bedoeld in het vijfde lid. In een dergelijk geval blijft de plaats de bescherming genieten die wordt verleend door de andere bepalingen van dit Protocol en de andere regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in gewapende conflicten.   

### Artikel  60  

####Gedemilitariseerde zones

1.  Het is de partijen bij het conflict verboden, hun militaire operaties uit te strekken tot de zones, waaraan zij bij overeenkomst de status van gedemilitariseerde zone hebben toegekend, indien die uitbreiding in strijd is met de bepalingen van een zodanige overeenkomst.   
2.  De overeenkomst dient uitdrukkelijk te worden aangegaan; zij kan mondeling of schriftelijk worden gesloten, hetzij rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van een beschermende mogendheid of een onpartijdige humanitaire organisatie, en kan bestaan uit wederkerige en overeenstemmende verklaringen. De overeenkomst kan zowel in vredestijd als na het uitbreken van de vijandelijkheden worden gesloten, en dient zo precies mogelijk de grenzen van de gedemilitaiseerde zone vast te stellen en te beschrijven, en - zo nodig - bepalingen omtrent het toezicht in te houden.   
3.  Onderwerp van een zodanige overeenkomst kan in de regel iedere zone zijn die aan de volgende voorwaaarden voldoet: 

(a) alle combattanten, evenals de mobiele wapens en de mobiele militaire uitrusting moeten zijn verwijderd;  

(b) vaste militaire installaties of inrichtingen mogen niet voor vijandelijke doeleinden worden gebruikt;  

(c) de autoriteiten of de bevolking mogen geen vijandelijke daden verrichten;  

(d) alle activiteiten, verband houdende met de militaire inspanningen, moeten zijn geëindigd.   De partijen bij het conflict dienen af te spreken welke interpretatie moet worden gegeven aan de voorwaarde, vervat in letter (d), en over de toelating tot de gedemilitariseerde zone van andere personen dan de in het vierde lid genoemde personen.   
4.  De aanwezigheid in deze zone van personen die een bijzondere bescherming krachtens de Verdragen en dit Protocol genieten, en van politie die daar verblijft met het uitsluitende doel, de orde te handhaven, is niet in strijd met de in het derde lid vervatte voorwaarden.   
5.  De partij die een zodanige zone beheerst, dient haar zoveel mogelijk van met de andere partij overeengekomen kentekenen te voorzien; deze kentekenen dienen zodanig te worden geplaatst dat zij duidelijk zichtbaar zijn, in het bijzonder bij de omtrek en de grenzen en aan de hoofdwegen.   
6.  Wanneer het strijdtoneel zich in de richting van een gedemilitariseerde zone verplaatst en de partijen bij het conflict ter zake overeenstemming hebben bereikt, mag geen van hen de zone gebruiken voor doeleinden die in verband staan met de militaire operaties, of de status ervan eenzijdig herroepen.   
7.  Indien één van de partijen bij het conflict een wezenlijke inbreuk maakt op de inhoud van de bepalingen van het derde of het zesde lid, is de andere partij ontslagen van haar verplichtingen krachtens de overeenkomst, waarbij aan de zone de status van gedemilitariseerde zone werd toegekend. In een dergelijk geval verliest de zone haar status, maar blijft zij de bescherming genieten die wordt verleend door de andere bepalingen van dit Protocol en de andere regels van volkenrecht, toepasselijk in gewapende conflicten.

### Artikel  62  

####Algemene bescherming

1.  Burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming en hun personeel dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Protocol, in het bijzonder van deze Sectie. Zij zijn gerechtigd hun taak op het gebied van de civiele bescherming te vervullen, behalve in geval van dwingende militaire noodzaak.   
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn eveneens van toepassing op burgers die, hoewel zij niet behoren tot een burgerinstelling voor de civiele bescherming, gevolg geven aan een oproep van de bevoegde autoriteiten en onder hun toezicht taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming vervullen.   
3.  Gebouwen en materieel die worden gebruikt voor doeleinden op het gebied van de civiele bescherming alsmede schuilgelegenheden die zijn bestemd voor de burgerbevolking vallen onder de werking van artikel 52. Objecten die worden gebruikt voor doeleinden op het gebied van de civiele bescherming mogen niet worden vernietigd, noch mag daaraan een andere bestemming worden gegeven, behalve door de partij aan welke zij toebehoren.   

### Artikel  63  

####Civiele bescherming in bezette gebieden

1.  In bezette gebieden dienen de instellingen voor de civiele bescherming van de autoriteiten de voor de vervulling van hun taak noodzakelijke faciliteiten te ontvangen. Het personeel ervan mag onder geen enkele omstandigheid worden verplicht handelingen te verrichten die een juiste vervulling van die taak verhinderen. De bezettende mogendheid mag op geen enkele wijze verandering brengen in de structuur of het personeel van dergelijke instellingen, waardoor de doeltreffende uitoefening van hun taak in gevaar zou kunnen worden gebracht. Van deze instellingen mag niet worden geëist, dat zij voorrang geven aan de onderdanen of de belangen van die mogendheid.   
2.  De bezettende mogendheid mag de burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming niet verplichten, dwingen of bewegen hun taak te vervullen op voor de belangen van de burgerbevolking nadelige wijze.   
3.  De bezettende mogendheid mag het personeel voor de civiele bescherming om veiligheidsredenen ontwapenen.   
4.  De bezettende mogendheid mag aan gebouwen of materieel, die toebehoren aan of in gebruik zijn bij een organisatie voor de civiele bescherming, niet een andere bestemming geven of deze vorderen indien dat schadelijk voor de burgerbevoliing zou zijn.   
5.  Mits de algemene regel, neergelegd in het vierde lid, blijvend in acht wordt genomen, mag de bezettende mogendheid die hulpmiddelen vorderen of daaraan een andere bestemming geven onder de volgende bijzondere voorwaarden: 

(a) dat de gebouwen of het materieel nodig zijn in verband met andere behoeften van de burgerbevolking;  

(b) dat de vordering of andere bestemming niet langer duurt dan gezien het bovenstaande noodzakelijk is.     
6.  De bezettende mogendheid mag aan de schuilgelegenheden die ter beschikking van de burgerbevolking zijn gesteld of die die bevolking nodig heeft, niet een andere bestemming geven, noch deze vorderen.   

### Artikel  64  

####Burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming behorende tot neutrale Staten of andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict, en internationale coördinerende instellingen

1.  De artikelen 62, 63, 65 en 66 zijn eveneens van toepassing op het personeel en het materieel van de burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming, behorende tot neutrale Staten of andere Staten welke geen partij zijn bij het conflict, die met toestemming en onder toezicht van een partij bij het conflict taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming als vermeld in artikel 61 vervullen op het grondgebied van die partij. Aan iedere betrokken tegenpartij dient zo spoedig mogelijk kennis te worden gegeven van een zodanige bijstand. Deze activiteit mag onder geen enkele omstandigheid worden aangemerkt als inmenging in het conflict. Bij de uitoefening ervan dient evenwel rekening te worden gehouden met de veiligheidsbelangen van de betrokken partijen bij het conflict.   
2.  De partijen bij het conflict die de in het eerste lid bedoelde bijstand ontvangen, en de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen die deze verlenen, moeten indien nodig de internationale coördinatie van zodanige acties op het gebied van de civiele verdediging vergemakkelijken. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van dit Hoofdstuk op de desbetreffende internationale instellingen van toepassing.   
3.  In bezette gebieden mag de bezettende mogendheid de activiteiten van de burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming, behorende tot neutrale Staten of andere Staten die geen partij zijn bij het conflict, en van internationale coördinerende instellingen alleen verbieden of beperken indien zij kan waarborgen, dat de taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming met gebruikmaking van haar eigen hulpbronnen of van die van het bezette grondgebied in voldoende mate kunnen worden vervuld.   

### Artikel  65  

####Beëindiging van de bescherming

1.  De bescherming waarop de burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming en het personeel, de gebouwen, de schuilgelegenheden en het materieel aanspraak hebben, eindigt alleen, wanneer deze buiten hun eigenlijke taak voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen verrichten of worden gebruikt om dergelijke handelingen te verrichten. De bescherming eindigt evenwel slechts nadat een waarschuwing is gegeven waarin, telkens wanneer daartoe aanleiding is, een redelijke termijn wordt gesteld, en nadat aan die waarschuwing geen gevolg is gegeven.   
2.  Als voor de vijand schadelijke handelingen worden niet beschouwd: 

(a) het feit dat taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming worden vervuld onder leiding of toezicht van militaire autoriteiten;  

(b) het feit dat burgerpersoneel voor de civiele bescherming samenwerkt met militair personeel bij de vervulling van taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming, of dat militair personeel is ingedeeld bij burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming;  

(c) het feit dat de vervulling van taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming mede ten goede zou kunnen komen aan militaire slachtoffers, in het bijzonder aan diegenen die buiten gevecht zijn gesteld.     
3.  Het feit dat het burgerpersoneel voor de civiele bescherming lichte persoonlijke wapens draagt ter handhaving van de orde of voor zijn eigen verdediging wordt evenmin als een voor de vijand schadelijke handeling beschouwd. In gebieden waar gevechten te land plaatsvinden of vermoedelijk zullen plaatsvinden, dienen de partijen bij het conflict evenwel passende maatregelen te nemen om deze wapens te beperken tot handvuurwapens, zoals pistolen of revolvers, ten einde het onderscheid tussen het personeel voor de civiele bescherming en de combattanten te vergemakkelijken. Zelfs indien het personeel voor de civiele bescherming andere lichte persoonlijke wapens draagt in dergelijke gebieden dient het niettemin te worden ontzien en beschermd zodra het als zodanig is herkend.   
4.  Het feit dat burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming op dezelfde wijze als de krijgsmacht zijn georganiseerd, of dat de dienst daarbij verplicht is, ontneemt hun evenmin de in dit hoofdstuk verleende bescherming.   

### Artikel  66  

####Identificatie

1.  Iedere partij bij het conflict moet de herkenbaarheid trachten te verzekeren van haar burgerinstellingen voor de civiele bescherming en het personeel, de gebouwen en het materieel daarvan, wanneer deze uitsluitend dienst doen voor de vervulling van taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming. De herkenbaarheid van de schuilgelegenheden, bestemd voor de burgerbevolking, dient op dezelfde wijze te worden verzekerd.   
2.  Iedere partij bij het conflict moet eveneens trachten werkwijzen en procedures te aanvaarden en uit te voeren, die de herkenbaarheid mogelijk maken van schuilgelegenheden voor de burgerbevolking, alsmede van personeel, gebouwen en materieel voor de civiele bescherming, die het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming dragen of waarop dat is aangebracht.   
3.  In bezette gebieden en in gebieden waar gevechten plaatsvinden of vermoedelijk zullen plaatsvinden, behoort het personeel voor de civiele bescherming herkenbaar te zijn aan het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming en aan een identiteitskaart, waaruit zijn status blijkt.   
4.  Het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming is een gelijkzijdig blauwe driehoek op een oranje veld, wanneer dit wordt gebruikt voor de bescherming van instellingen voor de civiele bescherming, het personeel, de gebouwen en het materieel daarvan, en voor schuilgelegenheden voor de burgerbevolking.   
5.  De partijen bij het conflict kunnen naast het kenteken, het gebruik overeenkomen van herkenningsseinen ter identificatie van de diensten voor de civiele bescherming.   
6.  De uitvoering van de bepalingen van het eerste tot en met het vierde lid wordt beheerst door Hoofdstuk V van Bijlage I bij dit Protocol.   
7.  In vredestijd kan het in het vierde lid omschreven teken met toestemming van de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten worden gebruikt ter identificatie van de diensten voor de civiele bescherming.   
8.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en de partijen bij het conflict dienen de noodzakelijke maatregelen te nemen voor het toezicht op het gebruik van het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming en voor het voorkomen en tegengaan van misbruik daarvan.   
9.  De herkenbaarheid van medisch personeel en geestelijke verzorgers, medische formaties en medische vervoermiddelen voor de civiele bescherming wordt eveneens beheerst door artikel 18.   

### Artikel  67  

####Leden van de strijdkrachten en militaire formaties die zijn ingedeeld bij instellingen voor de civiele bescherming

1.  Leden van de strijdkrachten en militaire formaties die zijn ingedeeld bij instellingen voor de civiele bescherming dienen te worden ontzien en beschermd, mits: 

(a) dat personeel en die formaties permanent zijn bestemd en uitsluitend dienen voor de vervulling van een der in artikel 61 genoemde taken;  

(b) dat personeel, wanneer het eenmaal die bestemming heeft gekregen, geen andere militaire taken verricht gedurende het conflict;  

(c) dat personeel zich duidelijk van de andere leden van de strijdkrachten onderscheidt doordat het duidelijk zichtbaar het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming draagt, dat voldoende groot dient te zijn, en mits dat personeel is voorzien van de in Hoofdstuk V van Bijlage I bij dit Protocol genoemde identiteitskaart, waaruit zijn status blijkt;  

(d) dat personeel en die formaties slechts zijn uitgerust met lichte persoonlijke wapens ter handhaving van de orde of voor hun eigen verdediging. De bepalingen van het derde lid van artikel 65 zijn in dit geval eveneens van toepassing;  

(e) dat personeel niet rechtstreeks aan de vijandelijkheden deelneemt en buiten zijn taak op het gebied van de civiele bescherming geen voor de tegenpartij schadelijke handelingen verricht of wordt gebruikt om zodanige handelingen te verrichten;  

(f) dat personeel en die formaties hun taak op het gebied van de civiele bescherming uitsluitend binnen het nationale grondgebied van hun eigen partij vervullen.   Het is ieder lid van de strijdkrachten dat is gebonden door de hierboven onder letters a en b gestelde voorwaarden, verboden de hierboven onder letter e gestelde voorwaarden niet in acht te nemen.   
2.  De leden van de strijdkrachten die dienst doen binnen een instelling voor de civiele bescherming worden, wanneer zij in handen van een tegenpartij vallen, als krijgsgevangene beschouwd. In bezet gebied mogen zij worden tewerkgesteld ten behoeve van taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming, in zoverre dat noodzakelijk is, mits die tewerkstelling uitsluitend in het belang van de burgerbevolking van dat gebied is en geschiedt op basis van vrijwilligheid wanneer dat werk gevaarlijk is.   
3.  Op de gebouwen en de belangrijkste gedeelten van de uitrusting en vervoermiddelen van bij instellingen voor de civiele bescherming ingedeelde militaire formaties dient het internationale kenteken van de civiele bescherming duidelijk te zijn aangebracht. Dit kenteken dient voldoende groot te zijn.   
4.  Het materieel en de gebouwen van de militaire formaties, die permanent bij instellingen voor de civiele bescherming zijn ingedeeld en uitsluitend zijn bestemd om taken op het gebied van de civiele bescherming te vervullen, blijven, indien zij in handen van een tegenpartij vallen, onderworpen aan het oorlogsrecht. Aan dat materieel en die gebouwen mag echter geen andere bestemming dan die op het gebied van de civiele bescherming worden gegeven zolang zij nodig zijn voor de vervulling van taken op dat gebied, behalve in geval van dwingende militaire noodzaak, tenzij van tevoren voorzieningen zijn getroffen om in voldoende mate in de behoeften van de burgerbevolking te kunnen voorzien.   

### SECTIE  II  

####HULPVERLENING TEN BEHOEVE VAN DE BURGERBEVOLKING

### Artikel  68  

####Toepassingsgebied

De bepalingen van deze Sectie zijn van toepassing op de burgerbevolking als omschreven in dit Protocol, en vormen een aanvulling op de artikelen 23, 55, 59, 60, 61 en 62 en de andere desbetreffende bepalingen van het Vierde Verdrag.  

### Artikel  69  

####Fundamentele behoeften in bezette gebieden

1.  De bezettende mogendheid dient naast haar verplichting betreffende levensmiddelen en geneeskundige benodigdheden, vermeld in artikel 55 van het Vierde Verdrag, met alle haar ten dienste staande middelen en zonder enig nadelig onderscheid, eveneens te verzekeren dat kleding, bedden en beddegoed worden verstrekt, evenals noodonderdak, andere benodigdheden die onmisbaar zijn voor het overleven van de burgerbevolking van het bezette gebied, en goederen die nodig zijn voor de eredienst.   
2.  Op hulpverleningsacties ten behoeve van de burgerbevolking van bezette gebieden zijn de artikelen 59, 60, 61, 62, 108, 109, 110 en 111 van het Vierde Verdrag en artikel 71 van dit Protocol van toepassing; deze acties dienen onverwijld te worden uitgevoerd.   

### Artikel  70  

####Hulpverleningsacties

1.  Wanneer de burgerbevolking van enig grondgebied, dat door een partij bij het conflict wordt beheerst en dat niet is bezet, niet voldoende is voorzien van de benodigdheden, vermeld in artikel 69, dienen hulpverleningsacties te worden ondernomen, welke humanitair van aard zijn en worden uitgevoerd zonder enig nadelig onderscheid, mits de bij die acties betrokken partijen daarmee instemmen. Aanbiedingen voor zodanige hulp worden niet aangemerkt als inmenging in het gewapende conflict, noch als onvriendschappelijke handelingen. Bij de verdeling van de hulpzendingen moet voorrang worden gegeven aan de personen aan wie krachtens het Vierde Verdrag of dit Protocol een voorkeursbehandeling of een bijzondere bescherming dient te worden verleend, zoals kinderen, aanstaande moeders, kraamvrouwen en zogende moeders.   
2.  De partijen bij het conflict, alsmede iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, dienen de snelle en ongehinderde doorgang toe te staan en te vergemakkelijken van alle zendingen, uitrusting en personeel voor hulpverlening, ter beschikking gesteld overeenkomstig deze Sectie, zelfs indien zodanige hulp is bestemd voor de burgerbevolking van de tegenpartij.   
3.  De partijen bij het conflict, alsmede iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die de doorgang van zendingen, uitrusting en personeel voor hulpverlening overeenkomstig het tweede lid toestaat: 

(a) hebben het recht regelingen van technische aard vast te stellen, daaronder begrepen doorzoeking en fouillering, krachtens welke een dergelijke doorgang is toegestaan;  

(b) kunnen een zodanige toestemming afhankelijk stellen van de voorwaarde, dat de verdeling van de zendingen geschiedt onder plaatselijk toezicht van een beschermende mogendheid;  

(c) mogen goederen voor hulpverlening op geen enkele wijze een andere bestemming geven, noch de doorzending daarvan vertragen, behalve in geval van dringende noodzaak in het belang van de betrokken burgerbevolking.     
4.  De partijen bij het conflict dienen zendingen voor hulpverlening te beschermen en de snelle verdeling daarvan te vergemakkelijken..   
5.  De partijen bij het conflict, alsmede iedere betrokken Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, dienen doeltreffende internationale coördinatie van de in het eerste lid bedoelde hulpverleningsacties te stimuleren en te vergemakkelijken.   

### Artikel  71  

####Personeel, deelnemende aan de hulpverleningsacties

1.  Indien nodig kan de hulp die bij een hulpverleningsactie wordt verschaft mede personeel voor hulpverlening omvatten, in het bijzonder voor het transport en de verdeling van de hulpzendingen; de deelneming van dergelijk personeel is onderworpen aan de toestemming van de partij op het grondgebied waarvan het zijn taken zal vervullen.   
2.  Zodanig personeel dient te worden ontzien en beschermd.   
3.  Iedere partij die hulpgoederen ontvangt moet het in het eerste lid bedoelde personeel voor hulpverlening zoveel mogelijk bijstand verlenen bij de vervulling van zijn taak op het gebied van de hulpverlening. Alleen in geval van dwingende militaire noodzaak mogen de activiteiten van het personeel voor hulpverlening worden beperkt of mogen op zijn bewegingen tijdelijk beperkingen worden aangebracht.   
4.  Het personeel voor hulpverlening mag onder geen enkele omstandigheid de grenzen van zijn taak, als aangegeven door dit Protocol, overschrijden. In het bijzonder dient het rekening te houden met de vereisten in verband met de veiligheid, die gelden voor de partij op het grondgebied waarvan het zijn taak vervult. De opdracht van elk lid van het personeel dat deze voorwaarden niet in acht neemt, kan worden beëindigd.   

### SECTIE  III  

####BEHANDELING VAN PERSONEN IN DE MACHT VAN EEN PARTIJ BIJ HET CONFLICT

### Hoofdstuk  I  

####TOEPASSINGSGEBIED EN BESCHERMING VAN PERSONEN EN OBJECTEN

### Artikel  72  

####Toepassingsgebied

De bepalingen van deze Sectie vormen een aanvulling op de regels betreffende de humanitaire bescherming van de zich in de macht van een partij bij het conflict bevindende burgers en burgerobjecten, neergelegd in het Vierde Verdrag, in het bijzonder in de Delen I en III daarvan, evenals op de andere toepasselijke regels van het volkenrecht betreffende de bescherming van de fundamentele rechten van de mens gedurende internationale gewapende conflicten.  

### Artikel  73  

####Vluchtelingen en staatlozen

Personen die vóór de aanvang van de vijandelijkheden werden beschouwd als staatlozen of als vluchtelingen krachtens de desbetreffende door de betrokken partijen aanvaarde internationale akten of krachtens de nationale wetgeving van de Staat die hen heeft opgenomen of waar zij verblijven, zijn beschermde personen in de zin van de Delen I en III van het Vierde Verdrag, onder alle omstandigheden en zonder enig nadelig onderscheid.  

### Artikel  74  

####Gezinshereniging

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en de partijen bij het conflict dienen op alle mogelijke wijzen de hereniging te vergemakkelijken van gezinnen die ten gevolge van gewapende conflicten zijn uiteengeraakt en dienen in het bijzonder het werk te bevorderen van de humanitaire organisaties die deze taak vervullen, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de Verdragen en dit Protocol en overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden veiligheidsvoorschriften.  

### Artikel  75  

####Fundamentele waarborgen

1.  Personen die zich in de macht van een partij bij het conflict bevinden en die niet een gunstiger behandeling genieten krachtens de Verdragen of dit Protocol dienen, voor zover zij zijn betrokken bij een situatie als bedoeld in artikel 1 van dit Protocol, onder alle omstandigheden menselijk te worden behandeld en dienen tenminste de door dit artikel verleende bescherming te ontvangen zonder enig nadelig onderscheid, gebaseerd op ras, huidkleur, geslacht, taal, godsdienst of geloof, politieke of andere overtuiging, nationale of maatschappelijke afkomst, rijkdom, geboorte of andere status, of op enig ander soortgelijk criterium.

(iii) lijfstraffen; en  

(iv) verminking;

(e) het dreigen om een van de bovengenoemde daden te begaan.     
3.  Ieder die wordt gearresteerd, gevangen gehouden of geïnterneerd wegens handelingen in verband met het gewapende conflict, dient onverwijld, in een taal die hij verstaat, op de hoogte te worden gebracht van de redenen, waarom die maatregelen zijn genomen. Behalve in het geval van arrestatie of gevangenhouding wegens strafbare feiten dienen zodanige personen op zo kort mogelijke termijn te worden vrijgelaten en in ieder geval zodra de omstandigheden die de arrestatie, de gevangenhouding of de internering rechtvaardigen, hebben opgehouden te bestaan.   
4.  Geen veroordeling mag worden uitgesproken en geen straf mag ten 'uitvoer worden gelegd met betrekking tot een persoon die schuldig is bevonden aan een strafbaar feit verband houdende met het gewapende conflict, dan krachtens voorafgaand vonnis, gewezen door een onpartijdige en op regelmatige wijze samengestelde rechtbank die de algemeen erkende beginselen van behoorlijk procesrecht in acht neemt, welke mede het volgende inhouden: 

(a) de procedure dient erin te voorzien, dat een verdachte onverwijld op de hoogte wordt gebracht van de bijzonderheden van het strafbare feit dat hem ten laste wordt gelegd, en dient deze verdachte voor en tijdens het proces alle nodige rechten en middelen voor zijn verdediging te verschaffen;

(c) niemand kan worden vervolgd of veroordeeld wegens een handelen of nalaten, dat rechtens geen strafbaar feit opleverde naar het nationale of internationale recht dat op hem van toepassing was ten tijde dat dit handelen of nalaten geschiedde; evenmin mag een zwaardere straf worden opgelegd dan die welke van toepassing was ten tijde van dit handelen of nalaten; indien de wet na het begaan van het strafbare feit in de oplegging van een lichtere straf mocht voorzien, dient de overtreder daarvan te profiteren;  

(d) ieder die wegens een strafbaar feit wordt vervolgd, wordt voor onschuldig gehouden totdat zijn schuld volgens de wet is bewezen;  

(e) ieder die wegens een strafbaar feit wordt vervolgd, heeft het recht in zijn tegenwoordigheid te worden berecht;  

(f) niemand mag worden gedwongen tegen zichzelf te getuigen of een bekentenis af te leggen;  

(g) ieder die wegens een strafbaar feit wordt vervolgd, heeft het recht, de getuigen à charge te ondervragen of te doen ondervragen en het oproepen en ondervragen van getuigen à décharge te doen geschieden op dezelfde voorwaarden als geschiedt ten aanzien van de getuigen à charge;  

(h) niemand mag door dezelfde partij worden vervolgd of gestraft wegens een strafbaar feit met betrekking waartoe eerder op grond van bepalingen van formeel en materieel strafrecht een onherroepelijk vonnis is gewezen, waarbij die persoon werd vrijgesproken of veroordeeld;  

(i) ieder die wordt vervolgd wegens een strafbaar feit heeft er recht op, dat het vonnis in het openbaar wordt uitgesproken;  

(j) een veroordeelde dient bij zijn veroordeling op de hoogte te worden gesteld van de rechtsmiddelen en andere middelen die hem ter beschikking staan en van de termijnen waarbinnen die moeten worden aangewend.     
5.  Vrouwen die van hun vrijheid zijn beroofd om redenen, verband houdende met het gewapende conflict, dienen te worden ondergebracht in verblijven die zijn gescheiden van die van de mannen. Zij dienen onder rechtstreeks toezicht van vrouwen te worden geplaatst. Niettemin moeten gezinnen, wanneer deze gevangen worden gehouden of zijn geïnterneerd, zoveel mogelijk op dezelfde plaats en in gezinsverband worden gehuisvest.   
6.  Personen die zijn gearresteerd, gevangen worden gehouden of zijn geïnterneerd om redenen, verband houdende met het gewapende conflict, dienen de door dit artikel verleende bescherming te genieten tot hun definitieve invrijheidstelling, repatriëring of nieuwe vestiging, ook na het einde van het gewapende conflict.   
7.  Ten einde iedere onzekerheid weg te nemen met betrekking tot de vervolging en berechting van personen, beschuldigd van oorlogsmisdrijven of misdrijven tegen de menselijkheid, gelden de volgende beginselen: 

(a) personen die worden beschuldigd van zodanige misdrijven dienen gerechtelijk te worden vervolgd en berecht overeenkomstig de regels van het toepasselijke volkenrecht;  

(b) aan een ieder die niet een gunstiger behandeling krachtens de Verdragen of dit Protocol geniet, dient de in dit artikel verleende behandeling te worden toegekend, ongeacht of de misdrijven waarvan hij wordt beschuldigd ernstige inbreuken van de Verdragen of dit Protocol opleveren.     
8.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel mag worden uitgelegd als een beperking of een aantasting van enige andere, gunstiger bepaling die een ruimere bescherming krachtens de regels van het toepasselijke volkenrecht toekent aan de personen, op wie het eerste lid van toepassing is.

Dit reglement verzekert, dat de taken van de Voorzitter van de Commissie te allen tijde kunnen worden uitgeoefend en dat deze, in het geval van een onderzoek, worden uitgeoefend door iemand die geen onderdaan is van een partij bij het conflict.   
7.  De administratieve kosten van de Commissie worden gedekt door contributies van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen die een verklaring krachtens het tweede lid hebben afgelegd, en door vrijwillige contributies. De partij of de partijen bij het conflict die om een onderzoek verzoeken, dienen de nodige gelden voor te schieten voor de kosten, gemaakt door een Kamer; deze gelden worden terugbetaald door de partij of de partijen waartegen de beschuldigingen naar voren zijn gebracht, tot een bedrag van 50% van de kosten van de Kamer. Wanneer voor de Kamer van de andere zijde eveneens beweringen naar voren zijn gebracht, dient iedere partij 50% van de benodigde gelden voor te schieten.   

### Artikel  91  

####Aansprakelijkheid

Een partij bij het conflict die de bepalingen van de Verdragen of dit Protocol schendt, is gehouden indien daartoe aanleiding is schadevergoeding te betalen. Zij is aansprakelijk voor alle handelingen, verricht door de personen die deel uitmaken van haar strijdkrachten.

De partijen bij het conflict kunnen het eentalige model van figuur 1 als richtsnoer nemen. Zij dienen elkaar bij het uitbreken van de vijandelijkheden een voorbeeld te zenden van het model dat zij gebruiken, indien dat model afwijkt van dat van figuur 1. De identiteitskaarten moeten, indien mogelijk, worden opgemaakt in twee exemplaren, waarvan er één dient te worden bewaard door de autoriteit die de kaarten afgeeft; deze moet controle blijven uitoefenen op de kaarten die zij heeft uitgegeven.   
3.  Onder geen enkele omstandigheid mag het permanente burgerlijke medisch personeel en de permanente burgerlijke geestelijke verzorgers hun identiteitskaart worden afgenomen. In het geval van verlies van een kaart zijn zij gerechtigd een duplicaat te ontvangen.   

### Artikel  2  

####Identiteitskaart voor het tijdelijke burgerlijke medisch personeel en de tijdelijke burgerlijke geestelijke verzorgers

1.  De identiteitskaart voor het tijdelijke burgerlijke medisch personeel en de tijdelijke burgerlijke geestelijke verzorgers dient zoveel mogelijk gelijk te zijn aan de in artikel 1 van deze voorschriften bedoelde kaart. De partijen bij het conflict kunnen het model van figuur 1 als richtsnoer nemen.

### Hoofdstuk  III  

####HERKENNINGSEISEN

### Artikel  5  

####Facultatief gebruik

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 6 van deze Voorschriften mogen de seinen, in dit Hoofdstuk omschreven en bestemd om uitsluitend door medische formaties en vervoermiddelen te worden gebruikt, niet worden gebruikt voor andere doeleinden. Het gebruik van alle in dit Hoofdstuk bedoelde seinen is facultatief.   
2.  Tijdelijke medische luchtvaartuigen, waarop hetzij door tijdgebrek of wegens hun bijzondere eigenschappen het kenteken niet kan worden aangebracht, kunnen de in dit Hoofdstuk toegestane eisen gebruiken. De doeltreffendste methode tot identificatie en herkenning van medische luchtvaartuigen is evenwel het gebruik van een visueel sein, hetzij het kenteken of het in artikel 6 omschreven lichtsein of beide, aangevuld door de andere in de artikelen 7 en 8 van deze Voorschriften bedoelde seinen.   

### Artikel  6  

####Lichtsein

1.  Het lichtsein, bestaande uit een blauw flitslicht, dient te worden gebruikt door medische luchtvaartuigen om hun identiteit kenbaar te maken. Andere luchtvaartuigen mogen dit sein niet gebruiken. De aanbevolen blauwe kleur wordt verkregen door middel van de volgende driekleurencoördinaten:  

| --- | --- |
|---|---|
| kleurbegrenzing/groen  | *y =* 0.065 + 0.805x  |
| kleurbegrenzing/wit  | *y* = 0.400 - x  |
| kleurbegrenzing/purper  | x = 0.133 + 0.600y  |

De aanbevolen frequentie van de blauwe flitsen is tussen zestig en honderd flitsen per minuut.   
2.  De medische luchtvaartuigen dienen te zijn uitgerust met de lichten die nodig zijn om het lichtsein in zoveel mogelijk richtingen zichtbaarheid te geven.   
3.  Bij afwezigheid van een bijzondere overeenkomst tussen de partijen bij het conflict, waarin het gebruik van blauwe flitslichten wordt voorbehouden voor de identificatie van medische voertuigen en medische schepen en vaartuigen, is het gebruik van zodanige seinen niet verboden voor andere voertuigen of schepen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Radioberichtgeving

1.  Het radiobericht bestaat uit een radiotelefonische of radiotelegrafische mededeling, voorafgegaan door een prioriteitsherkenningssein, dat dient te zijn aangewezen en goedgekeurd door een Mondiale Administratieve Radioconferentie van de Internationale Vereniging voor Telecommunicatie. Het signaal moet driemaal worden uitgezonden vóór de roepnaam van het desbetreffende medische transport. Deze mededeling dient in het Engels te worden uitgezonden met passende tussenpozen op een frequentie of op frequenties, aangewezen overeenkomstig het derde lid. Het gebruik van het prioriteitssein is uitsluitend voorbehouden aan medische formaties en vervoermiddelen.   
2.  De in het eerste lid vermelde mededeling per radio, voorafgegaan door het prioriteitsherkenningssein, dient de volgende gegevens over te brengen: 

(a) roepnaam van het medische transport;  

(b) positie van het medische transport;  

(c) nummer en type van de medische vervoermiddelen;  

(d) voorgenomen route;  

(e) geschatte tijdsduur van de tocht en geschat tijdstip van vertrek en aankomst, naar gelang van de omstandigheden;  

(f) ieder ander gegeven zoals vlieghoogte, bewaakte radiofrequenties, overeengekomen talen en wijze van gebruik en codes van radarbewaking met- behulp van herkenningsbakens.     
3.  Ter vergemakkelijking van de verbindingen, bedoeld in het eerste en het tweede lid, evenals van de verbindingen, bedoeld in de artikelen 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 en 31 van het Protocol, kunnen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, de partijen bij een conflict of één van de partijen bij een conflict, in onderlinge overeenstemming of ieder afzonderlijk, overeenkomstig de Tabel van toewijzingen van frequenties van het bij het Internationale Verdrag betreffende de Telecommunicatie gevoegde Radioreglement, daartoe uitgekozen nationale frequenties aanwijzen en bekendmaken om door hen voor zodanige verbindingen te worden gebruikt. Deze frequenties dienen te worden medegedeeld aan de Internationale Vereniging voor Telecommunicatie overeenkomstig een door een Mondiale Administratieve Radioconferentie goed te keuren procedure.   

### Artikel  8  

####Elektronische identificatie

1.  Het radar-bewakingssysteem met behulp van herkenningsbakens (SSR-systeem), als omschreven in Bijlage 10 bij het Verdrag van Chicago inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart van 7 december 1944, zoals dat periodiek is gewijzigd, kan worden gebruikt om een medisch luchtvaartuig te identificeren en de vlucht daarvan te volgen. De wijze van gebruik en de codes die moeten worden voorbehouden voor het uitsluitende gebruik door medische luchtvaartuigen dienen te worden vastgesteld door de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, de partijen bij een conflict of één van de partijen bij een conflict, in onderlinge overeenstemming of ieder afzonderlijk, overeenkomstig een door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie aan te bevelen procedure.   
2.  De partijen bij een conflict kunnen in een bijzondere overeenkomst voor onderling gebruik een soortgelijk elektronisch systeem voor de identificatie van medische voertuigen en van medische schepen en vaartuigen vaststellen.   

### Hoofdstuk  IV  

####VERBINDINGEN

### Artikel  9  

####Radioverbindingen

Het in artikel 7 van deze Voorschriften voorziene prioriteitssein kan voorafgaan aan de daarvoor in aanmerking komende radioverbindingen van de medische formaties en vervoermiddelen ter toepassing van de krachtens de artikelen 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 en 31 van het Protocol gevolgde procedures.  

### Artikel  10  

####Gebruik van internationale codes

De medische formaties en vervoermiddelen kunnen tevens de door de Internationale Vereniging voor Telecommunicatie, de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie en de Intergouvernementele Maritieme Consultatieve Organisatie vastgestelde codes en seinen gebruiken. Deze codes en seinen dienen te worden gebruikt in overeenstemming met de door die Organisaties opgestelde normen, gebruiken en procedures.  

### Artikel  11  

####Andere verbindingsmiddelen

Wanneer in het radioverkeer twee weg-verbindingen niet mogelijk zijn, kunnen de seinen, voorzien in het door de Intergouvernementele Maritieme Consultatieve Organisatie aangenomen Internationale Seinboek of in de desbetreffende Bijlage bij het Verdrag van Chicago inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart van 7 december 1944, zoals dat periodiek is gewijzigd, worden gebruikt.  

### Artikel  12  

####Vluchtplannen

De in artikel 29 van het Protocol voorziene overeenkomsten en mededelingen betreffende vluchtplannen dienen zoveel mogelijk te worden geformuleerd overeenkomstig door de Internationale Burgerluchtvaartorganisatie opgestelde procedures.  

### Artikel  13  

####Seinen en procedures voor de onderschepping van medische luchtvaartuigen

Wanneer een onderscheppingsvliegtuig wordt gebruikt om de identiteit van een medisch luchtvaartuig tijdens de vlucht vast te stellen of om dat medisch luchtvaartuig het bevel tot landen te geven overeenkomstig de artikelen 30 en 31 van het Protocol, dienen de visuele standaardprocedures en de radiostandaardprocedures betreffende onderschepping, voorgeschreven door Bijlage 2 bij het Verdrag van Chicago inzake de burgerluchtvaart van 7 december 1944, zoals dat periodiek is gewijzigd, te worden gebruikt door het onderscheppingsvliegtuig en het medische luchtvaartuig.
