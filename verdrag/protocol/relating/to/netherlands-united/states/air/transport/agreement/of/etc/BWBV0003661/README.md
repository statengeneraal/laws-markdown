However, nothing in this paragraph shall limit the rights of one Contracting Party to require airlines designated under this Article by the other Contracting Party to adhere to requirements relating to the protection of passenger funds and passenger cancellation and refund rights.   
(c).  Neither Contracting Party shall require a designated airline of the other Contracting Party, in respect of the carriage of traffic from the territory of that other Contracting Party on a one-way or roundtrip basis, to submit more than a declaration of conformity with the laws, regulations and rules of that other Contracting Party referred to under paragraph (b) of this Article or of a waiver of these regulations or rules granted by the aeronautical authorities of that other Contracting Party.

####Enforcement

(a).  The Contracting Party in whose territory the traffic originates shall, for practical purposes, have exclusive jurisdiction for the enforcement of its rules and regulations.   
(b).  The Contracting Parties shall cooperate with each other on enforcement matters. Where evidence is obtained of a possible violation of the rules of the other Contracting Party with regard to traffic originating in that Party's territory, a Contracting Party shall transmit such evidence to the other Contracting Party for investigation and appropriate enforcement action, instead of interrupting flights or interfering with traffic which originated in the territory of the other Contracting Party.   
(c).  Each Contracting Party may take such steps as it considers necessary to regulate the conduct of its own airlines, charterers, travel organizers, agents, forwarders or shippers offering or organizing services covered by the Agreement and this Protocol.

### Article  9  

####Aviation Security

The Contracting Parties reaffirm their grave concern about acts or threats against the security of aircraft, which jeopardize the safety of persons or property, adversely affect the operation of air services and undermine public confidence in the safety of civil aviation. The Contracting Parties agree to provide maximum aid to each other with a view to preventing hijackings and sabotage to aircraft, airports and air navigation facilities and threats to aviation security. The Contracting Parties reaffirm their commitments under and shall have regard to the provisions of the Convention on Offences and certain other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on September 14, 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on December 16, 1970, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on September 23, 1971. The Contracting Parties shall also have regard to applicable aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Contracting Parties agree to observe the security provisions required by each Party for entry into the territory of that Party. The Parties agree to take adequate measures to screen passengers and their carry-on items. When incidents or threats of hijacking or sabotage against aircraft, airports or air navigation facilities occur, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications intended to terminate such incidents rapidly and safely. Each Contracting Party shall give sympathetic consideration to any request from the other for special security measures for its aircraft or passengers to meet a particular threat.  

### Article  10  

####Commercial Operations

(a).  Each designated airline shall have the right to perform its own ground handling in the territory of the other Contracting Party or to use the services of an authorized agent of its choice. Such agents shall be freely authorized, subject to the availability of airport facilities.   
(b).  

1. User charges that may be imposed by the competent charging authorities or bodies of one Contracting Party on the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party shall be just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. In any event, any such charge shall be assessed on the airlines of the other Contracting Party on terms not less favorable than the most favorable terms available to any other airline at the time the charges are assessed.  

2. User charges imposed on the airlines of the other Contracting Party may reflect, but shall not exceed, an equitable portion of the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport, air navigation, airport environmental, and aviation security facilities and services, and in the case of airports, may provide for a reasonable rate of return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which charges are made shall be provided on an efficient basis. Reasonable notice shall be given prior to changes in user charges.  

3. Each Contracting Party shall encourage consultations between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and airlines using the services and facilities, and shall encourage the competent charging authorities or bodies and the airlines to exchange such information as may be necessary for an accurate review of the reasonableness of the charges in light of the principles of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article.     

### Article  11

### Article  13  

####Revision of Agreement

Consultations shall be scheduled at an early date for the purpose of concluding within six months a new air transport agreement governing all types of air services which would incorporate the provisions of this Protocol and up-to-date provisions on such matters as airworthiness and security standards, user charges, commercial operations and arbitration.

De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij heeft/hebben het recht internationaal chartervervoer van passagiers (en hun bagage) en/of vracht te verrichten tussen een punt of punten in de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij via tussenliggende punten naar een punt of punten in de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij en verdergelegen punten, met dien verstande dat de dienst een punt moet aandoen op het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de luchtvaartmaatschappij aanwijst. Bij het uitvoeren van de onder dit artikel vallende diensten heeft/hebben de luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ook het recht: 

1. te landen op elk punt binnen of buiten het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen;  

2. vervoer te verrichten via het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

3. op hetzelfde luchtvaartuig vervoer te combineren van oorsprong uit het grondgebied van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij met vervoer van oorsprong uit het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij;  

4. op hetzelfde luchtvaartuig vervoer te combineren van oorsprong uit of bestemd voor een punt of punten na een op haar grondgebied gelegen punt met vervoer tussen de V.S. en Nederland; en  

5. op hetzelfde luchtvaartuig vervoer te combineren afkomstig uit of bestemd voor een tussenliggend punt of tussenliggende punten of vervoer van oorsprong uit of bestemd voor een punt of punten verder gelegen dan het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met vervoer tussen de V.S. en Nederland.   Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt aanvragen van de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij(en) van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om vervoer te verrichten dat niet onder dit artikel valt, in welwillende overweging op basis van hoffelijkheid en wederkerigheid.   
(b).  Een door een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschapij die internationale charterluchtdiensten verricht die hun oorsprong hebben op het grondgebied van een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, kan zich naar keuze houden aan de wetten, voorschriften en regels inzake charters van haar eigen land of aan die van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Indien een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verschillende regels, voorschriften, voorwaarden, bedingen of beperkingen toepast op een of meer van haar luchtvaartmaatschappijen, of op luchtvaartmaatschappijen van verschillende landen, is elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij aan de minst beperkende criteria onderworpen. Geen enkele bepaling in deze paragraaf beperkt evenwel de rechten van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij om van ingevolge dit artikel door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen te verlangen dat deze zich houden aan de eisen betreffende de bescherming van de gelden van passagiers en de rechten van passagiers inzake annulering en teruggave van gelden.   
(c).

### Artikel  5  

####Eerlijke mededinging

1.  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij stelt de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op eerlijke, gelijke en non-discriminatoire wijze in de gelegenheid tot concurrentie met de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
2.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen beperkt eenzijdig de omvang van het verkeer, de frequentie of de regelmaat van de dienst, dan wel het type of de typen luchtvaartuig(en) geëxploiteerd door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, behalve voor zover noodzakelijk is om redenen van douanetechnische, technische, operationele of milieutechnische aard, onder eenvormige voorwaarden die in overeenstemming zijn met artikel 15 van het Verdrag.   
3.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen legt aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een verplichting tot eerste weigering, een proportionele beperking (,uplift ratio’), een heffing voor verklaring van geen bezwaar of enige andere eis op met betrekking tot de capaciteit, de frequentie of het vervoer die onverenigbaar zou zijn met de doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst.   
4.  Geen van beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlangt dat luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dienstregelingen, programma's voor charterluchtdiensten, of vluchtuitvoeringsplannen ter goedkeuring aan haar voorleggen, behalve voor zover vereist op non-discriminatoire basis, om eenvormige voorwaarden te handhaven als voorzien in het tweede lid van dit artikel, of als specifiek in deze Overeenkomst toegestaan. Indien een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij indiening van gegevens ter informatie verlangt, beperkt zij de administratieve last van de vereisten en procedures betreffende indiening voor tussenpersonen in het luchtvervoer en voor de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tot een minimum.   

### Artikel  7  

####Goedkeuring van vluchten of programma's

(a).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij beperkt zoveel mogelijk de administratieve beslommeringen voor de charteraars en de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij inzake de aanmeldingsvereisten en -procedures.   
(b).  Een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, die voornemens is chartervervoer te verrichten, aanvangend op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, dient de toepasselijke regels van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij na te leven.   
(c).  Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlangt van een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, met betrekking tot het verrichten van chartervervoer, aanvangend op het grondgebied van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, dat deze meer overlegt dan een verklaring dat is voldaan aan de in de aanwijzing van die andere Partij omschreven regels, dan wel dat door de luchtvaartautoriteiten van die andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ontheffing van die regels is verleend.   
(d).  Niettegenstaande lid (c) hierboven kan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verlangen dat een aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij van te voren de gegevens omtrent de vluchten verstrekt, die nodig zijn ten behoeve van de douane, de luchthavens en de luchtverkeersleiding.   
(e).  De aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen dienen de bestaande procedures in acht te nemen met betrekking tot de beurtregeling bij het gebruik van de luchthaven, en desgevraagd aan de betrokken autoriteiten van te voren mededeling te doen inzake vluchten of series van vluchten.   
(f).  Geen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verlangt voorafgaande toestemming voor vluchten, of mededeling van gegevens daaromtrent, door de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, behalve zoals is bepaald in de leden (b), (c), (d) en (e) hierboven.   

### Artikel  8  

####Tenuitvoerlegging

(a).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij op wier grondgebied het verkeer aanvangt, bezit uitsluitende bevoegdheid tot tenuitvoerlegging van haar regels en voorschriften.   
(b).  De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen werken samen in aangelegenheden inzake tenuitvoerlegging. Een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij draagt, wanneer bewijsmateriaal inzake een mogelijke schending van de regels van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij wordt verkregen met betrekking tot verkeer, aanvangend op het grondgebied van die Partij, dat bewijsmateriaal aan die andere Partij over voor onderzoek en passende maatregelen tot tenuitvoerlegging, in plaats van vluchten te onderbreken of vervoer te belemmeren, aangevangen op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
(c).  Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan de maatregelen nemen die zij noodzakelijk acht ter regeling van het gedrag van haar eigen luchtvaartmaatschappijen, charteraars, reisorganisatoren, vertegenwoordigers, expediteurs of verladers, die diensten aanbieden of organiseren waarop de Overeenkomst en dit Protocol van toepassing zijn. Deze regelingen vormen evenwel geen uitsluiting of beperking van de bevoegdheid van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tot regeling, binnen haar grondgebied en overeenkomstig haar nationale wetten, van het gedrag van zodanige organisaties of personen van de eerstbedoelde Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   

### Artikel  9  

####Beveiliging van de luchtvaart

De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bevestigen opnieuw hun ernstige bezorgdheid over handelingen of bedreigingen tegen de veiligheid van luchtvaartuigen, die de veiligheid van personen of goederen in gevaar brengen, de exploitatie van luchtdiensten nadelig beïnvloeden en het vertrouwen van het publiek in de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart ondermijnen. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen elkaar de grootst mogelijke hulp te verschaffen met het oog op het voorkomen van kapingen en sabotage aan luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens en luchtvaartfaciliteiten, alsmede van bedreigingen van de veiligheid van de luchtvaart. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen bevestigen opnieuw hun verplichtingen krachtens, en houden rekening met de bepalingen van het op 14 september 1963 te Tokio ondertekende Verdrag inzake strafbare feiten en bepaalde andere handelingen begaan aan boord van luchtvaartuigen, het op 16 december 1970 te 's-Gravenhage ondertekende Verdrag tot bestrijding van het wederrechtelijk in zijn macht brengen van luchtvaartuigen, en het op 23 september 1971 te Montreal ondertekende Verdrag tot bestrijding van wederrechtelijke gedragingen, gericht tegen de veiligheid van de burgerluchtvaart. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen houden eveneens rekening met de toepasselijke bepalingen inzake de beveiliging van de luchtvaart, vastgesteld door de Internationale Organisatie voor de Burgerluchtvaart. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen komen overeen de door elke Partij vereiste beveiligingsmaatregelen voor de binnenkomst op het grondgebied van die Partij in acht te nemen. De Partijen komen overeen passende voorzieningen te treffen om passagiers en hun handbagage te controleren. Wanneer zich voorvallen of bedreigingen van kaping of sabotage tegen luchtvaartuigen, luchthavens of luchtvaartfaciliteiten voordoen, staan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen elkaar bij door het berichtenverkeer te vergemakkelijken, bestemd om dergelijke voorvallen snel en veilig te beëindigen. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij neemt ieder verzoek van de andere tot bijzondere beveiligingsvoorzieningen voor haar luchtvaartuigen of passagiers ten einde aan een bijzondere bedreiging het hoofd te bieden in welwillende overweging.  

### Artikel  10  

####Commerciële aspecten

(a).  Elke aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappij heeft het recht haar eigen afhandeling op de grond te verrichten op het grondgebied van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, of gebruik te maken van de diensten van een bevoegde vertegenwoordiger van haar keuze. Zodanige vertegenwoordigers worden onbeperkt toegelaten, afhankelijk van de beschikbaarheid van luchthavenfaciliteiten.   
(b).  

1. Gebruiksvergoedingen die door de daartoe bevoegde autoriteiten of organen van de ene Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening kunnen worden gebracht aan de aangewezen luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij dienen billijk, redelijk, en non-discriminatoir te zijn en naar billijkheid te worden verdeeld over de categorieën gebruikers. In elk geval worden deze gebruiksvergoedingen aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening gebracht op voorwaarden die niet minder gunstig zijn dan de gunstigste voorwaarden die gelden voor andere luchtvaartmaatschappijen op het tijdstip waarop de vergoedingen in rekening worden gebracht.  

2. Aan de luchtvaartmaatschappijen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij in rekening gebrachte verbruiksvergoedingen kunnen een weerspiegeling zijn van, doch mogen niet meer bedragen dan, een billijk gedeelte van de volledige kosten van de daartoe bevoegde autoriteiten of organen voor het verschaffen van de desbetreffende luchthaven-, luchtnavigatie-, luchthavenmilieutechnische en de veiligheid van de luchtvaart betreffende voorzieningen en diensten en kunnen in het geval van luchthavens een redelijk rendement omvatten van de activa, na afschrijving. De voorzieningen en diensten waarvoor vergoedingen in rekening worden gebracht worden efficiënt verschaft. Van veranderingen in gebruiksheffingen dient op redelijke termijn voorafgaande kennisgeving te worden gedaan.  

3. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij bevordert het overleg tussen de autoriteiten of organen op haar grondgebied die bevoegd zijn kosten in rekening te brengen en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen die van de diensten en voorzieningen gebruik maken, en bevordert dat de autoriteiten of organen die bevoegd zijn kosten in rekening te brengen en de luchtvaartmaatschappijen de gegevens uitwisselen die nodig kunnen zijn voor een nauwkeurige toetsing van de redelijkheid van de kosten in het licht van de beginselen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel.     

### Artikel  11  

####Capaciteit

Artikel 10 van de Overeenkomst wordt gewijzigd door het tweede lid daarvan te schrappen, en de op 25 november 1969 gewisselde brieven inzake artikel 10 van de Overeenkomst zijn niet langer van kracht.  

### Artikel  12  

####Multilaterale overeenkomst

Indien een multilaterale overeenkomst inzake het charterluchtvervoer, door beide Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aanvaard, in werking treedt, worden de Overeenkomst en dit Protocol gewijzigd ten einde overeen te stemmen met de bepalingen van de multilaterale overeenkomst.  

### Artikel  13  

####Herziening van de Overeenkomst

Op korte termijn zal overleg plaatsvinden met het doel binnen zes maanden een nieuwe luchtvaartovereenkomst te sluiten die van toepassing is op alle soorten luchtdiensten en waarin de bepalingen van dit Protocol zijn opgenomen, alsook aan de ontwikkelingen aangepaste bepalingen inzake aangelegenheden zoals luchtwaardigheid en beveiligingsmaatstaven, gebruiksvergoedingen, commerciële aspecten en arbitrage.  

### Artikel  14  

####Inwerkingtreding

De bepalingen van dit Protocol worden toegepast vanaf de datum van ondertekening daarvan totdat een nieuwe luchtvaartovereenkomst, als voorzien in artikel 13 van dit Protocol, in werking treedt.
