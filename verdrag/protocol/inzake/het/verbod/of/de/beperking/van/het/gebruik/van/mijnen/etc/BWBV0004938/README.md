### Article  2  

####Definitions

For the purpose of this Protocol: 

1. “Mine” means a munition placed under, on or near the ground or other surface area and designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person or vehicle.  

2. “Remotely-delivered mine” means a mine not directly emplaced but delivered by artillery, missile, rocket, mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an aircraft. Mines delivered from a land-based system from less than 500 metres are not considered to be “remotely delivered”, provided that they are used in accordance with Article 5 and other relevant Articles of this Protocol.  

3. “Anti-personnel mine” means a mine primarily designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.  

4. “Booby-trap” means any device or material which is designed, constructed, or adapted to kill or injure, and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act.  

5. “Other devices” means manually-emplaced munitions and devices including improvised explosive devices designed to kill, injure or damage and which are actuated manually, by remote control or automatically after a lapse of time.  

6. “Military objective” means, so far as objects are concerned, any object which by its nature, location, purpose or use makes an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.  

7. “Civilian objects” are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 6 of this Article.  

8. “Minefield” is a defined area in which mines have been emplaced and “ mined area” is an area which is dangerous due to the presence of mines. “Phoney minefield” means an area free of mines that simulates a minefield. The term “minefield” includes phoney minefields.  

9. “Recording” means a physical, administrative and technical operation designed to obtain, for the purpose of registration in official records, all available information facilitating the location of minefields, mined areas, mines, booby-traps and other devices.  

10. “Self-destruction mechanism” means an incorporated or externally attached automatically-functioning mechanism which secures the destruction of the munition into which it is incorporated or to which it is attached.  

11. “Self-neutralization mechanism” means an incorporated automatically-functioning mechanism which renders inoperable the munition into which it is incorporated.  

12. “Self-deactivating” means automatically rendering a munition inoperable by means of the irreversible exhaustion of a component, for example, a battery, that is essential to the operation of the munition.  

13. “Remote control” means control by commands from a distance.  

14. “Anti-handling device” means a device intended to protect a mine and which is part of, linked to, attached to or placed under the mine and which activates when an attempt is made to tamper with the mine.  

15. “Transfer” involves, in addition to the physical movement of mines into or from national territory, the transfer of title to and control over the mines, but does not involve the transfer of territory containing emplaced mines.    

### Article  3  

####General restrictions on the use of mines, booby-traps and other devices

1.  This Article applies to: 

a) mines;  

b) booby-traps; and  

c) other devices.     
2.  Each High Contracting Party or party to a conflict is, in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol, responsible cfor all mines, booby-traps, and other devices employed by it and undertakes to clear, remove, destroy or maintain them as specified in Article 10 of this Protocol.   
3.  It is prohibited in all circumstances to use any mine, booby-trap or other device which is designed or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.   
4.  Weapons to which this Article applies shall strictly comply with the standards and limitations specified in the Technical Annex with respect to each particular category.   
5.  It is prohibited to use mines, booby-traps or other devices which employ a mechanism or device specifically designed to detonate the munition by the presence of commonly available mine detectors as a result of their magnetic or other non-contact influence during normal use in detection operations.   
6.  It is prohibited to use a self-deactivating mine equipped with an anti-handling device that is designed in such a manner that the anti-handling device is capable of functioning after the mine has ceased to be capable of functioning.   
7.  It is prohibited in all circumstances to direct weapons to which this Article applies, either in offence, defence or by way of reprisals, against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians or civilian objects.   
8.  The indiscriminate use of weapons to which this Article applies is prohibited. Indiscriminate use is any placement of such weapons: 

a) which is not on, or directed against, a military objective. In case of doubt as to whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used;  

b) which employs a method or means of delivery which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or  

c) which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.     
9.  Several clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects are not to be treated as a single military objective.   
10.  All feasible precautions shall be taken to protect civilians from the effects of weapons to which this Article applies. Feasible precautions are those precautions which are practicable or practically possible taking into account all circumstances ruling at the time, including humanitarian and military considerations. These circumstances include, but are not limited to: 

a) the short- and long-term effect of mines upon the local civilian population for the duration of the minefield;  

b) possible measures to protect civilians (for example, fencing, signs, warning and monitoring);  

c) the availability and feasibility of using alternatives; and  

d) the short- and long-term military requirements for a minefield.     
11.  Effective advance warning shall be given of any emplacement of mines, booby-traps and other devices which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.   

### Article  4  

####Restrictions on the use of anti-personnel mines

It is prohibited to use anti-personnel mines which are not detectable, as specified in paragraph 2 of the Technical Annex.

####Restrictions on the use of anti-personnel mines other than remotely-delivered mines

1.  This Article applies to anti-personnel mines other than remotely-delivered mines.   
2.  It is prohibited to use weapons to which this Article applies which are not in compliance with the provisions on self-destruction and self-deactivation in the Technical Annex, unless: 

a) such weapons are placed within a perimeter-marked area which is monitored by military personnel and protected by fencing or other means, to ensure the effective exclusion of civilians from the area. The marking must be of a distinct and durable character and must at least be visible to a person who is about to enter the perimeter-marked area; and  

b) such weapons are cleared before the area is abondoned, unless the area is turned over to the forces of another State which accept responsibility for the maintenance of the protections required by this Article and the subsequent clearance of those weapons.     
3.  A party to a conflict is relieved from further compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs 2a) and 2b) of this Article only if such compliance is not feasible due to forcible loss of control of the area as a result of enemy military action, including situations where direct enemy military action makes it impossible to comply. If that party regains control of the area, it shall resume compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs 2a) and 2b) of this Article.   
4.  If the forces of a party to a conflict gain control of an area in which weapons to which this Article applies have been laid, such forces shall, to the maximum extent feasible, maintain and, if necessary, establish the protections required by this Article until such weapons have been cleared.   
5.  All feasible measures shall be taken to prevent the unauthorized removal, defacement, destruction or concealment of any device, system or material used to establish the perimeter of a perimeter-marked area.   
6.  Weapons to which this Article applies which propel fragments in a horizontal arc of less than 90 degrees and which are placed on or above the ground may be used without the measures provided for in sub-paragraph 2a) of this Article for a maximum period of 72 hours, if: 

a) they are located in immediate proximity to the military unit that emplaced them; and  

b) the area is monitored by military personnel to ensure the effective exclusion of civilians.

3.  It is prohibited to use remotely-delivered mines other than anti-personnel mines, unless, to the extent feasible, they are equipped with an effective self-destruction or self-neutralization mechanism and have a back-up self-deactivation feature, which is designed so that the mine will no longer function as a mine when the mine no longer serves the military purpose for which it was placed in position.   
4.  Effective advance warning shall be given of any delivery or dropping of remotely-delivered mines which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.   

### Article  7  

####Prohibitions on the use of booby-traps and other devices

i) historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples; or  

j) animals or their carcasses.     
2.  It is prohibited to use booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material.   
3.  Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 3, it is prohibited to use weapons to which this Article applies in any city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians in which combat between ground forces is not taking place or does not appear to be imminent, unless either: 

a) they are placed on or in the close vicinity of a military objective; or  

b) measures are taken to protect civilians from their effects, for example, the posting of warning sentries, the issuing of warnings or the provision of fences.     

### Article  8  

####Transfers

1.  In order to promote the purposes of this Protocol, each High Contracting Party: 

a) undertakes not to transfer any mine the use of which is prohibited by this Protocol;  

b) undertakes not to transfer any mine to any recipient other than a State or a State agency authorized to receive such transfers;

### Article  9  

####Recording and use of information on minefields, mined areas, mines, booby-traps and other devices

1.  All information concerning minefields, mined areas, mines, booby-traps and other devices shall be recorded in accordance with the provisions of the Technical Annex.   
2.  All such records shall be retained by the parties to a conflict, who shall, without delay after the cessation of active hostilities, take all necessary and appropriate measures, including the use of such information, to protect civilians from the effects of minefields, mined areas, mines, booby-traps and other devices in areas under their control. At the same time, they shall also make available to the other party or parties to the conflict and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations all such information in their possession concerning minefields, mined areas, mines, booby-traps and other devices laid by them in areas no longer under their control; provided, however, subject to reciprocity, where the forces of a party to a conflict are in the territory of an adverse party, either party may withhold such information from the Secretary-General and the other party, to the extent that security interests require such withholding, until neither party is in the territory of the other. In the latter case, the information withheld shall be disclosed as soon as those security interests permit. Wherever possible, the parties to the conflict shall seek, by mutual agreement, to provide for the release of such information at the earliest possible time in a manner consistent with the security interests of each party.

Whenever feasible the minefield record shall show the exact location of every mine, except in row minefields where the row location is sufficient. The precise location and operating mechanism of each booby-trap laid shall be individually recorded.    

b) The estimated location and area of remotely-delivered mines shall be specified by coordinates of reference points (normally corner points) and shall be ascertained and when feasible marked on the ground at the earliest opportunity. The total number and type of mines laid, the date and time of laying and the self-destruction time periods shall also be recorded.  

c) Copies of records shall be held at a level of command sufficient to guarantee their safety as far as possible.  

d) The use of mines produced after the entry into force of this Protocol is prohibited unless they are marked in English or in the respective national language or languages with the following information: 

(i) name of the country of origin;  

(ii) month and year of production; and  

(iii) serial number or lot number.   The marking should be visible, legible, durable and resistant to environmental effects, as far as possible.    

2. Specifications on detectability 

a) With respect to anti-personnel mines produced after 1 January 1997, such mines shall incorporate in their construction a material or device that enables the mine to be detected by commonly-available technical mine detection equipment and provides a response signal equivalent to a signal from 8 grammes or more of iron in a single coherent mass.  

b) With respect to anti-personnel mines produced before 1 January 1997, such mines shall either incorporate in their construction, or have attached prior to their emplacement, in a manner not easily removable, a material or device that enables the mine to be detected by commonly-available technical mine detection equipment and provides a response signal equivalent to a signal from 8 grammes or more of iron in a single coherent mass.  

c) In the event that a High Contracting Party determines that it cannot immediately comply with sub-paragraph b), it may declare at the time of its notification of consent to be bound by this Protocol that it will defer compliance with sub-paragraph b) for a period not to exceed 9 years from the entry into force of this Protocol.

Dit Protocol is niet van toepassing in situaties van binnenlandse ongeregeldheden en spanningen, zoals rellen, op zichzelf staande en sporadische gewelddadigheden en andere soortgelijke daden die geen gewapende conflicten zijn.   
3.  In geval van gewapende conflicten die geen internationaal karakter hebben en die zich voordoen op het grondgebied van een van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, is elke partij bij het conflict gehouden het bepaalde inzake de verboden en de beperkingen van dit Protocol toe te passen.   
4.  Op geen enkele bepaling van dit Protocol kan een beroep worden gedaan voor het maken van inbreuk op de soevereiniteit van een staat of de verantwoordelijkheid van de regering om met alle wettelijke middelen de openbare orde in de staat te handhaven of te herstellen of de nationale eenheid en de territoriale integriteit van de staat te verdedigen.   
5.  Op geen enkele bepaling van dit Protocol kan een beroep worden gedaan ter rechtvaardiging van directe of indirecte interventie, om welke reden dan ook, in het gewapend conflict of in de binnenlandse of buitenlandse aangelegenheden van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan dit conflict zich voordoet.   
6.  Door de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Protocol op partijen bij een conflict die geen Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn en die dit Protocol hebben aanvaard, wordt noch impliciet, noch expliciet hun juridische status of die van een betwist grondgebied gewijzigd.   

### Artikel  2  

####Begripsomschrijvingen

Voor de toepassing van dit Protocol wordt verstaan onder: 

1. „Mijn”: een stuk munitie geplaatst onder, op of vlak boven de grond of ander oppervlak en ontworpen om te exploderen door de aanwezigheid of nabijheid van of het contact met een persoon of voertuig.  

2. „Op afstand gelegde mijn”: een mijn die niet rechtstreeks wordt geplaatst, maar wordt overgebracht door artillerie, projectielen, raketten, mortieren of soortgelijke middelen, of afgeworpen vanuit een vliegtuig. Mijnen die vanaf een systeem te land op minder dan 500 meter worden overgebracht, worden niet geacht „op afstand gelegd” te zijn, mits zij worden gebruikt in overeenstemming met artikel 5 en de andere desbetreffende artikelen van dit Protocol.  

3. „Anti-personeelmijn”: een mijn die hoofdzakelijk is ontworpen om te exploderen door de aanwezigheid of de nabijheid van ofwel het contact met een persoon en die ertoe is bestemd een of meer personen buiten gevecht te stellen, letsel toe te brengen of te doden.  

4. „Valstrikmijn”: een mechanisme of stof ontworpen, geconstrueerd of aangepast om te doden of letsel toe te brengen en dat onverwacht werkt wanneer een persoon een ogenschijnlijk onschuldig voorwerp aanraakt of nadert, of een ogenschijnlijk veilige handeling verricht.  

5. „Andere mechanismen”: met de hand geplaatste munitie en mechanismen, met inbegrip van geïmproviseerde explosieve mechanismen, ontworpen om te doden, letsel of schade toe te brengen, en die in werking worden gesteld met de hand, door bediening op afstand dan wel automatisch na het verstrijken van een bepaalde tijd.  

6. „Militair doel”: voor zover het objecten betreft, ieder object dat naar zijn aard, ligging, bestemming of gebruik een daadwerkelijke bijdrage tot de krijgsverrichtingen levert en waarvan de gehele of gedeeltelijke vernietiging, verovering of onbruikbaarmaking onder de omstandigheden van dat moment een duidelijk militair voordeel oplevert.  

7. „Burgerobjecten”: alle objecten die geen militaire doelen zijn zoals omschreven onder punt 6 van dit artikel.  

8. „Mijnenveld”: een afgebakend gebied waarin mijnen zijn geplaatst en „bemijnd gebied”: een gebied dat gevaarlijk is ten gevolge van de aanwezigheid van mijnen. „Vals mijnenveld”: een gebied zonder mijnen dat een mijnenveld simuleert. De term „mijnenveld” heeft mede betrekking op valse mijnenvelden.  

9. „Registratie”: een feitelijke, administratieve en technische handeling, verricht met het oogmerk, ten behoeve van opneming in de officiële registers, alle beschikbare informatie te verkrijgen waardoor de plaatsbepaling van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen wordt vergemakkelijkt.  

10. „Zelfvernietigingsmechanisme”: een automatisch werkend in de munitie opgenomen of daaraan bevestigd mechanisme dat zorgt voor de vernietiging van de munitie waarin het is opgenomen of waaraan het is bevestigd.  

11. „Zelfneutraliseringsmechanisme”: een automatisch werkend in de munitie opgenomen mechanisme dat de munitie waarin het is opgenomen onbruikbaar maakt.  

12. „Zelfdeactivering”: het automatisch buiten werking stellen van munitie door middel van onomkeerbare uitputting van een onderdeel, bijvoorbeeld een batterij, dat essentieel is voor het functioneren van de munitie.  

13. „Afstandsbediening”: bediening op afstand.  

14. „Anti-hanteermechanisme”: een mechanisme bestemd voor het beschermen van een mijn, dat onderdeel is van, verbonden met, bevestigd aan of geplaatst onder de mijn en dat in werking wordt gesteld wanneer een poging wordt gedaan de mijn te manipuleren.  

15. „Overdracht”: naast de fysieke verplaatsing van mijnen naar of van het grondgebied van een staat, de overdracht van het eigendomsrecht en van de zeggenschap over de mijnen, maar niet de overdracht van een grondgebied waarop mijnen zijn geplaatst.    

### Artikel  3  

####Algemene beperkingen op het gebruik van mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen

1.  Dit artikel is van toepassing op: 

a. mijnen;  

b. valstrikmijnen; en  

c. andere mechanismen.     
2.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij of partij bij een conflict is, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Protocol, verantwoordelijk voor alle mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen die door haar worden gebruikt en verbindt zich ertoe deze te ruimen, te verwijderen, te vernietigen of te onderhouden zoals is bepaald in artikel 10 van dit Protocol.   
3.  Het is onder alle omstandigheden verboden mijnen, valstrikmijnen of andere mechanismen te gebruiken die zijn ontworpen om overbodig letsel of onnodig leed te veroorzaken of die naar hun aard dergelijk letsel of leed kunnen veroorzaken.   
4.  Wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moeten strikt voldoen aan de eisen en beperkingen die in de Technische Bijlage per categorie worden gesteld.   
5.  Het is verboden mijnen, valstrikmijnen of andere mechanismen te gebruiken die zijn uitgerust met een mechanisme of toestel dat speciaal is ontworpen om de munitie te laten exploderen, zonder dat er contact is, onder invloed van het magnetisch veld of onder invloed van iets anders als gevolg van de aanwezigheid van een normaal verkrijgbare mijndetector, die gewoonlijk wordt gebruikt voor detectiewerkzaamheden.   
6.  Het is verboden een zelfdeactiverende mijn te gebruiken die is uitgerust met een anti-hanteermechanisme en die op een zodanige wijze is ontworpen dat het anti-hanteermechanisme kan blijven functioneren wanneer de mijn zelf niet meer kan functioneren.   
7.  Het is onder alle omstandigheden verboden wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, offensief, defensief of bij wijze van represaille, te richten tegen de burgerbevolking als zodanig of tegen individuele burgers of burgerobjecten.   
8.  Het niet-onderscheidend gebruik van wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, is verboden. Niet-onderscheidend gebruik is iedere plaatsing van deze wapens: 

a. die niet is op, of gericht tegen, een militair doel. Bij twijfel over de vraag of een object dat gewoonlijk bestemd is voor civiele doeleinden, zoals een plaats voor godsdienstige verering, een huis of ander onderkomen of een school, wordt gebruikt om een effectieve bijdrage aan een militaire actie te leveren, wordt dit object geacht hiertoe niet te worden gebruikt;  

b. waarbij een methode of wijze van leggen wordt gehanteerd die niet tegen een bepaald militair doel kan worden gericht; of  

c. die, naar kan worden verwacht, zal leiden tot bijkomend verlies van mensenlevens onder de burgerbevolking, verwondingen van burgers, schade aan burgerobjecten of een combinatie daarvan, in een mate die buitensporig zou zijn in verhouding tot het verwachte tastbare rechtstreekse militaire voordeel.     
9.  Verscheidene duidelijk gescheiden militaire doelen die zijn gesitueerd in een stad, dorp of ander gebied waarin zich een vergelijkbare concentratie burgers of burgerobjecten bevindt, kunnen niet als één militair doel worden beschouwd.   
10.  Alle praktisch uitvoerbare voorzorgsmaatregelen dienen te worden genomen ter bescherming van burgers tegen de uitwerking van de wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is. Praktisch uitvoerbare voorzorgsmaatregelen zijn die voorzorgsmaatregelen die uitvoerbaar of praktisch mogelijk zijn, rekening houdend met alle omstandigheden van het moment, met inbegrip van humanitaire en militaire overwegingen. Deze omstandigheden zijn de volgende, waarbij echter geen sprake is van een limitatieve opsomming: 

a. het korte- en lange-termijneffect van mijnen op de lokale burgerbevolking zolang het mijnenveld blijft bestaan;  

b. mogelijke maatregelen om de burgers te beschermen (bijvoorbeeld afzetting, markering, waarschuwing en bewaking);  

c. de beschikbaarheid en praktische uitvoerbaarheid van alternatieven; en  

d. de militaire noodzakelijkheid op korte en lange termijn van een mijnenveld.     
11.  Er dient op effectieve wijze een waarschuwing te worden gegeven vóór elke plaatsing van mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen die de burgerbevolking zouden kunnen treffen, tenzij de omstandigheden dat niet toelaten.   

### Artikel  4  

####Beperkingen op het gebruik van anti-personeelmijnen

Het is verboden anti-personeelmijnen te gebruiken die niet op te sporen zijn in de zin van punt 2 van de Technische Bijlage.

2.  Het is verboden wapens te gebruiken waarop dit artikel van toepassing is en die niet voldoen aan de bepalingen inzake zelfvernietiging en zelfdeactivering in de Technische Bijlage, tenzij: 

a. dergelijke wapens worden geplaatst in een gebied waarvan de omtrek wordt gemarkeerd en dat wordt bewaakt door militair personeel en wordt beschermd door een afzetting of andere middelen om burgers doeltreffend te verhinderen het gebied te betreden. De markering moet herkenbaar en duurzaam zijn en moet ten minste zichtbaar zijn voor een persoon die zich in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van dit gebied bevindt; en  

b. dergelijke wapens worden geruimd voordat het gebied wordt verlaten, tenzij het gebied wordt overgedragen aan de strijdkrachten van een andere staat, die de verantwoordelijkheid aanvaardt voor het onderhoud van de in dit artikel vereiste beschermingsmiddelen en, vervolgens, de ruiming van deze wapens.     
3.  Een partij bij een conflict wordt slechts ontheven van de verplichting te voldoen aan het bepaalde in het tweede lid, onder a) en b) van dit artikel indien zij daartoe wordt verhinderd omdat zij is gedwongen de zeggenschap over het gebied op te geven als gevolg van een vijandelijke militaire actie, of indien zij hiertoe niet in staat is vanwege een rechtstreekse vijandelijke militaire actie. Indien die partij weer de zeggenschap over dit gebied heeft, is zij opnieuw verplicht aan het bepaalde in het tweede lid onder a en b van dit artikel te voldoen.   
4.  Indien de strijdkrachten van een partij bij een conflict de zeggenschap krijgen over een gebied waarin wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is zijn geplaatst, dienen zij, totdat deze wapens zijn geruimd, zo veel mogelijk, de in dit artikel vereiste beschermingsmiddelen te onderhouden en, indien nodig, aan te brengen.   
5.  Alle uitvoerbare maatregelen dienen te worden genomen ter voorkoming van onbevoegde verwijdering, beschadiging, vernieling of achterhouding van een mechanisme, systeem of materialen gebruikt om de omtrek van een gebied te markeren.

2.  Het is verboden op afstand gelegde anti-personeelmijnen te gebruiken die niet voldoen aan de bepalingen inzake zelfvernietiging en zelfdeactivering in de Technische Bijlage.   
3.  Het is verboden op afstand gelegde mijnen, anders dan antipersoneelmijnen, te gebruiken, tenzij deze, voor zover mogelijk, zijn uitgerust met een doeltreffend zelfvernietigings- of zelfneutraliseringsmechanisme en een aanvullende inrichting hebben voor zelfdeactivering die zodanig is ontworpen dat de mijnen niet langer als zodanig functioneren wanneer de mijnen niet langer het militaire doel dienen waarvoor zij zijn geplaatst.   
4.  Er dient op doeltreffende wijze een waarschuwing te worden gegeven, voorafgaand aan het leggen of het afwerpen van op afstand gelegde mijnen die ook de burgerbevolking zouden kunnen treffen, tenzij de omstandigheden dit niet toelaten.   

### Artikel  7  

####Verbod van het gebruik van valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen

1.  Onverminderd de bij gewapende conflicten toe te passen regels van het volkenrecht met betrekking tot bedrog en verraad, is het onder alle omstandigheden verboden valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen te gebruiken die op enigerlei wijze zijn gehecht aan of verbonden met:

2.  Het is verboden valstrikmijnen of andere mechanismen te gebruiken in de vorm van kennelijk ongevaarlijke draagbare voorwerpen die speciaal zijn ontworpen en geproduceerd om explosief materiaal te bevatten.   
3.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 3, is het verboden wapens waarop dit artikel van toepassing is te gebruiken in een stad, dorp of ander gebied waarin zich een vergelijkbare concentratie van burgers bevindt, waar geen gevecht tussen landstrijdkrachten plaatsvindt of op korte termijn te verwachten lijkt, tenzij: 

a. deze worden geplaatst op of in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van een militair doel; of  

b. maatregelen worden genomen om de burgers tegen hun uitwerking te beschermen, bijvoorbeeld door het plaatsen van schildwachten, het doen uitgaan van waarschuwingen of het aanbrengen van afzettingen.     

### Artikel  8  

####Overdracht

1.  Ter bevordering van de doelstellingen van dit Protocol, verplicht elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zich ertoe: 

a. geen mijnen over te dragen waarvan het gebruik bij dit Protocol is verboden;  

b. geen mijnen over te dragen aan een ontvanger, niet zijnde een staat of een orgaan van een staat dat bevoegd is deze te ontvangen;  

c. terughoudendheid te betrachten bij de overdracht van mijnen waarvan het gebruik bij dit Protocol is beperkt. In het bijzonder verbindt iedere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zich ertoe geen anti-personeelmijnen over te dragen aan staten die niet door dit Protocol zijn gebonden, tenzij de ontvangende staat ermee instemt dit Protocol toe te passen; en  

d. ervoor in te staan dat elke overdracht overeenkomstig dit artikel geschiedt met volledige inachtneming, door zowel de overdragende als de ontvangende staat, van de relevante bepalingen van dit Protocol en de toepasselijke normen van het internationale humanitaire recht.     
2.  Indien een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij verklaart dat zij naleving van de specifieke bepalingen met betrekking tot het gebruik van bepaalde mijnen, zoals is geregeld in de Technische Bijlage, uitstelt, blijft het eerste lid, onder a), van dit artikel, echter op die mijnen van toepassing.   
3.  Alle Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen onthouden zich, zolang dit Protocol nog niet in werking is getreden, van alle handelingen die in strijd zouden zijn met het eerste lid, onder a), van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  9  

####Registratie en gebruik van informatie inzake mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen

2.  Al deze gegevens dienen te worden bewaard door de partijen bij een conflict die, onmiddellijk na de beëindiging van de daadwerkelijke vijandelijkheden, alle nodige en passende maatregelen dienen te nemen, waaronder het gebruik van deze informatie, teneinde de burgers te beschermen tegen de uitwerking van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen in de gebieden waarover zij zeggenschap hebben. Tegelijkertijd verschaffen alle partijen bij een conflict aan de andere partij of partijen en aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties alle informatie betreffende mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen die zij hebben geplaatst in gebieden waarover zij geen zeggenschap meer hebben; wanneer echter, met inachtneming van wederkerigheid, de strijdkrachten van een partij bij een conflict zich op het grondgebied van de tegenpartij bevinden, kan elke partij nalaten dergelijke informatie te verschaffen aan de Secretaris-Generaal en de andere partij, voor zover veiligheidsbelangen dit eisen, totdat geen partij zich meer op het grondgebied van de andere partij bevindt. In het laatste geval dient de achtergehouden informatie te worden verspreid zodra de genoemde veiligheidsbelangen dit toelaten. De partijen bij het conflict dienen er, indien mogelijk, naar te streven, in onderlinge overeenstemming, regelingen te treffen voor het vrijgeven van deze informatie op zo kort mogelijke termijn en op een wijze die verenigbaar is met de veiligheidsbelangen van elke partij.   
3.  Dit artikel laat het bepaalde in de artikelen 10 en 12 van dit Protocol onverlet.   

### Artikel  10  

####Het ruimen van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen en internationale samenwerking

1.  Onmiddellijk na de beëindiging van de daadwerkelijke vijandelijkheden dienen alle mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen te worden geruimd, verwijderd, vernietigd of onderhouden in overeenstemming met artikel 3 en artikel 5, tweede lid, van dit Protocol.   
2.  De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en de partijen bij een conflict nemen deze verantwoordelijkheid op zich ten aanzien van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen in de gebieden waarover zij zeggenschap hebben.   
3.  Wanneer een partij geen zeggenschap meer heeft over de gebieden waarin zij mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen heeft gelegd, verleent zij aan de partij die de zeggenschap heeft over dit gebied krachtens het tweede lid van dit artikel, voor zover laatstgenoemde partij dit toestaat, de technische en materiële bijstand die nodig is om deze verantwoordelijkheid te dragen.   
4.  Steeds wanneer dat nodig is, streven de partijen ernaar overeenstemming te bereiken, zowel onderling als, indien nodig, met andere staten en met internationale organisaties, inzake de verlening van technische en materiële bijstand, met inbegrip, indien de omstandigheden zich daartoe lenen, van gezamenlijk optreden, noodzakelijk om deze verantwoordelijkheden na te komen.   

### Artikel  11  

####Technologische samenwerking en bijstand

1.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij verplicht zich ertoe een zo ruim mogelijke uitwisseling van uitrustingen, materieel en wetenschappelijke en technische informatie inzake de toepassing van dit Protocol en van mijnruimmiddelen te bevorderen en heeft het recht te participeren in een dergelijke uitwisseling. In het bijzonder leggen de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen geen onredelijke beperkingen op inzake het leveren van uitrustingen voor het ruimen van mijnen en daarmee verband houdende technologische informatie voor humanitaire doeleinden.   
2.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij verbindt zich ertoe informatie te verstrekken ten behoeve van de databank inzake mijnruiming die in het kader van de Verenigde Naties is ingesteld, in het bijzonder informatie betreffende diverse mijnruimmiddelen en -technieken, alsmede lijsten van deskundigen, gespecialiseerde organisaties of nationale contactpunten inzake mijnruiming.   
3.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die daartoe in staat is, verleent bijstand ten behoeve van mijnruiming via organen van de Verenigde Naties, andere internationale organisaties of op bilaterale basis, of stort een financiële bijdrage in het Vrijwillig Mijnruimingsfonds van de Verenigde Naties (United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance).   
4.  Verzoeken van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen om bijstand, onderbouwd met relevante informatie, kunnen worden gericht tot de Verenigde Naties, tot andere daarvoor in aanmerking komende organisaties of tot andere staten. De verzoeken kunnen worden ingediend bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die deze doorzendt naar alle Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen en naar de bevoegde internationale organisaties.   
5.  Wanneer verzoeken tot de Verenigde Naties worden gericht, kan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, binnen de hem ter beschikking staande mogelijkheden, de nodige maatregelen nemen om de situatie te beoordelen en, in samenwerking met de verzoekende Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij, bepalen welke bijstand ten behoeve van mijnruiming dient te worden verleend of op welke wijze uitvoering aan het Protocol dient te worden gegeven. De Secretaris-Generaal kan tevens verslag uitbrengen aan de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen over elk van deze beoordelingen en over de aard en de omvang van de verzochte bijstand.   
6.  Onverminderd hun constitutionele en andere wettelijke bepalingen verplichten de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zich tot samenwerking en overdracht van technologie ter vergemakkelijking van de uitvoering van de in dit Protocol vermelde relevante verboden en beperkingen.   
7.  Elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij heeft het recht, desgewenst, te trachten technische bijstand te verkrijgen van een andere Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij en deze te ontvangen met betrekking tot specifieke relevante technologie, anders dan op het gebied van wapens, voor zover noodzakelijk en mogelijk, teneinde de periode van opschorting van de naleving van bepaalde bepalingen, zoals in de Technische Bijlage bepaald, te bekorten.

####Technische Bijlage

1. Registratie 

a. De registratie van de locatie van andere dan op afstand gelegde mijnen, van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen, geschiedt in overeenstemming met de volgende bepalingen: 

i. de locatie van de mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden en de gebieden waar valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen zijn geplaatst, dient nauwkeurig te worden aangegeven, gerelateerd aan de coördinaten van ten minste twee referentiepunten en door middel van de geraamde omvang van het gebied waar deze wapens liggen met betrekking tot die referentiepunten;  

ii. kaarten, diagrammen of andere gegevens dienen zodanig te worden opgesteld dat zij de locatie van mijnenvelden, bemijnde gebieden, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen aangeven, gerelateerd aan de referentiepunten; deze gegevens dienen tevens hun omtrek en omvang aan te geven; en  

iii. ten behoeve van de opsporing en het ruimen van mijnen, valstrikmijnen en andere mechanismen dienen kaarten, diagrammen of andere gegevens volledige informatie te bevatten inzake type, nummer, plaatsingsmethode, type ontstekingsinrichting en levensduur, datum en tijdstip waarop zij zijn gelegd, antihanteermechanisme (indien aanwezig) en andere relevante informatie met betrekking tot alle aldus geplaatste wapens. Steeds wanneer dit mogelijk is, dient het document inzake een mijnenveld de exacte locatie van elke mijn aan te geven, behalve in mijnenvelden met een rijenpatroon, in welk geval de locatie van de rijen voldoende is. De exacte locatie en het werkingsmechanisme van elke gelegde valstrikmijn dienen afzonderlijk te worden geregistreerd.    

b. De geraamde locatie en het verspreidingsgebied van op afstand gelegde mijnen dient te worden aangegeven, gerelateerd aan de coördinaten van referentiepunten (doorgaans de hoekpunten) en dient te worden geverifieerd en bij de eerste daarvoor in aanmerking komende gelegenheid, indien mogelijk, op de grond te worden gemarkeerd. Het totale aantal en het type gelegde mijnen, de datum en het tijdstip waarop deze zijn gelegd en de zelfvernietigingstermijn dienen eveneens te worden geregistreerd.  

c. Exemplaren van de documenten dienen op een bevelsniveau te worden bewaard dat hoog genoeg is om de veiligheid ervan zo veel mogelijk te kunnen waarborgen.  

d. Het gebruik van mijnen die zijn vervaardigd na de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol is verboden, tenzij zij zijn voorzien van de volgende gegevens, in het Engels of in de nationale taal of talen: 

i. naam van het land van herkomst;  

ii. productiejaar en -maand; en  

iii. serienummer of partijnummer.   Deze gegevens dienen voor zover mogelijk zichtbaar, leesbaar, duurzaam en bestand tegen omgevingsinvloeden te zijn.    

2. Specificaties inzake de opspoorbaarheid 

a. In de constructie van na 1 januari 1997 geproduceerde antipersoneelmijnen dient een stof of mechanisme te worden opgenomen dat ervoor zorgt dat de mijn kan worden opgespoord met behulp van gangbare technische mijnopsporingsmiddelen en dat een responssignaal afgeeft dat equivalent is aan een signaal van 8 gram of meer ijzer dat een enkele coherente massa vormt.  

b. In de constructie van vóór 1 januari 1997 geproduceerde antipersoneelmijnen dient een stof of mechanisme te worden opgenomen – of vóór de plaatsing op een niet gemakkelijk te verwijderen wijze aan deze mijnen worden gehecht – dat ervoor zorgt dat de mijn kan worden opgespoord met behulp van gangbare technische mijnopsporingsmiddelen en dat een responssignaal afgeeft dat equivalent is aan een signaal van 8 gram of meer ijzer dat een enkele coherente massa vormt.  

c. Wanneer een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij van oordeel is dat zij niet onmiddellijk aan het bepaalde onder b kan voldoen, kan zij bij haar kennisgeving van het feit dat zij ermee instemt door dit Protocol te worden gebonden verklaren dat zij de naleving van het bepaalde onder b uitstelt gedurende een periode van ten hoogste 9 jaar vanaf de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol. Gedurende deze periode zal zij het gebruik van anti-personeelmijnen die niet aan deze bepalingen voldoen zo veel mogelijk beperken.    

3. Specificaties inzake zelfvernietiging en zelfdeactivering 

a. Alle op afstand gelegde anti-personeelmijnen dienen zodanig te worden ontworpen en geproduceerd dat niet meer dan 10% van de in werking gestelde mijnen zichzelf niet binnen 30 dagen na de plaatsing vernietigt. Elke mijn dient te zijn voorzien van een aanvullend zelfdeactiveringsmechanisme dat zodanig is ontworpen en geproduceerd dat, in combinatie met het zelfvernietigingsmechanisme, niet meer dan een op de duizend in werking gestelde mijnen 120 dagen na plaatsing nog als mijn functioneert.  

b. Alle niet op afstand gelegde mijnen die buiten gemarkeerde gebieden als bedoeld in artikel 5 van dit Protocol worden gebruikt, moeten voldoen aan de onder a bedoelde eisen inzake zelfvernietiging en zelfdeactivering  

c. Wanneer een Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij van oordeel is dat zij niet onmiddellijk aan het bepaalde onder a en/of b kan voldoen, kan zij bij haar kennisgeving van het feit dat zij ermee instemt door dit Protocol te worden gebonden verklaren dat zij met betrekking tot vóór de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol geproduceerde mijnen de naleving van het bepaalde onder a en/of b uitstelt gedurende een periode van ten hoogste 9 jaar vanaf de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol. Gedurende deze periode van uitstel: 

i. verplicht de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij zich ertoe het gebruik van anti-personeelmijnen die niet aan deze bepalingen voldoen zo veel mogelijk te beperken; en  

ii. voldoet de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij wat betreft de op afstand gelegde anti-personeelmijnen aan de eisen inzake zelfvernietiging of zelfdeactivering en, wat betreft andere anti-personeelmijnen, ten minste aan de eisen inzake zelfdeactivering.      

4. Internationale markering voor mijnenvelden en bemijnde gebieden Borden die gelijk zijn aan het bijgevoegde en hieronder beschreven voorbeeld moeten worden gebruikt om mijnenvelden en bemijnde zones te markeren, opdat deze door de burgerbevolking kunnen worden gezien en herkend: 

a. afmetingen en vorm: een driehoek of vierkant van ten minste 28 cm (11 inches) x 20 cm (7.9 inches) voor een driehoek, en 15 cm (6 inches) per zijde voor een vierkant;  

b. kleur: rood of oranje met een gele reflecterende rand;  

c. symbool: het symbool waarvan de illustratie in het Aanhangsel staat of een ander symbool dat gemakkelijk herkenbaar is als symbool dat een gevaarlijk gebied aanduidt in het gebied waar het moet worden aangebracht;  

d. taal: op het bord moet het woord „mijnen” staan in een van de zes officiële verdragstalen (Arabisch, Chinees, Engels, Frans, Russisch en Spaans) en in de hoofdtaal of -talen van dat gebied; en  

e. spreiding: de borden moeten rondom het mijnenveld of een bemijnd gebied worden geplaatst op een zodanige afstand dat zij door burgers die het gebied naderen vanaf elk punt kunnen worden gezien.”
