####PROTOCOL ON ROAD SIGNS AND SIGNALS

The States Parties to this Protocol, desiring to ensure the safety of road traffic and to facilitate international road traffic by a uniform system of road signalling, have agreed upon the following provisions:     
### PART  I  

####General provisions

### Article  1  

The contracting Parties to this Protocol accept the system of road signalling described herein and undertake to introduce it as soon as possible. For this purpose they will erect the signs set out in this Protocol as and when new signs are put up or those now in existence are renewed. Signs which do not conform to the system provided in this Protocol shall be completely replaced within a period not exceeding ten years from the date of the coming into force of this Protocol in respect of each of the Contracting Parties.  

### Article  2  

The Contracting Parties undertake, as soon as this Protocol comes into force, to replace signs which, although they have the distinguishing features of a sign belonging to the system provided in this Protocol, are used with a different meaning from the one attaching to that sign in this system.  

### PART  II  

####Roadside traffic signs

### CHAPTER  I  

####General

### Article  3  

The international system of roadside traffic signs shall comprise three classes of signs namely: 

(a) Danger signs;  

(b) Signs giving definite instructions subdivided into: 

(i) Prohibitory signs,  

(ii) Mandatory signs;    

(c) Informative signs subdivided into: 

(i) Indication signs,  

(ii) Advance direction signs and direction signs,  

(iii) Place and route identification signs.      

### Article  4  

There shall be a distinctive shape for each class of sign.  

### Article  5  

1.  The symbols as indicated on the signs shown in the tables appended to this Protocol shall be accepted bij the Contracting Parties as the fundamental basis of their roadside traffic signs. As a rule they shall appear within the signplate.   
2.  Where Contracting Parties consider it necessary to modify the symbols, these modifications shall be such as not to alter the essential character of the symbols.   
3.  For the purpose of facilitating the interpretation of the signs additional information may be given on a rectangular plate below the sign.   
4.  Where an inscription is used within or below a sign, it shall be in the national language or languages, and if so desired in one of the official languages of the United Nations. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the inscription “stop” referred to in article 33, paragraph 2.   
5.  New signs created by Contracting Parties in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 17 of the Convention on Road Traffic opened for signature at Geneva on 19 September 1949, shall be communicated to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall notify all Contracting Parties.   

### Article  6  

1.  The colours used on the signs, symbols and inscriptions shall be those prescribed in this Protocol, unless exceptional conditions make them impracticable.   
2.  Where the colours to be used are optional, each country shall employ the same colours for any one class of signs used under the same conditions.   
3.  The reverse side of signs shall be of a neutral colour except in the case of the signs III, C.I *a, b* and symbol II, A. 15 when affixed to he reverse side of sign II, A. 14.   

### Article  7  

The use of lighting or of reflecting materials or devices is recommended at least for danger signs and signs giving definite instructions where such use improves the visibility of roadside traffic signs at night time; but they should not dazzle road users or obscure the legibility of the symbol or the inscription.  

### Article  8  

1.  The dimensions of sign plates shall be such that the sign can be easily seen from a distance and easily understood near at hand.   
2.  The dimensions of various signs shall be standardised in each country so as to ensure the maximum uniformity. In general, two sizes shall be used for each type, namely, a standard size and a reduced size for use where conditions do not permit or the safety of road users does not require the erection of the standard sizes. In exceptional circumstances, a special small type sign may be used inside built up areas or for repeating the main sign.   

### Article  9  

1.  Outside built-up areas, the centre line of the signs shall be not more than 2 m from the nearside edge of the carriageway unless special circumstances render this impracticable.   
2.  In built-up areas and mountainous country, the distance between the edge of the sign nearest the carriageway and a vertical line drawn from the edge of the carriageway shall be not less than 0.50 m. In exceptional cases, however, this distance may be reduced.   

### Article  10  

1.  In this Protocol the height of signs above the ground shall mean the height of the lower edge of the signs from the level of the road.   
2.  So far as possible a uniform height shall be observed over the same route.   

### CHAPTER  II  

####Class I. Danger signs

### Article  11  

1.  The danger signs shall be in the shape of an equilateral triangel with one point upwards except in the case of sign “Priority road ahead” (I, 22) which shall have a point downwards.   
2.  These signs shall have a red border with white or light yellow ground. Symbols shall be black or dark.   
3.  For signs of the standard size, the length of each side of the triangle shall be not less than 0.90 m and for the reduced size, not less than 0.60 m.   
4.  The signs shall be placed on the side of the road appropriate to the direction of the traffic concerned and facing that traffic. They may be repeated on the other side of the road.   
5.  Unless otherwise provided hereafter in this Protocol, the signs shall be placed at not less than 150 m and not more than 250 m from the hazard unless this is impracticable on account of local conditions. In such exceptional cases the sign shall be erected at less than 150 m, but as far as possible from the hazard and special provisions shall be made.   
6.  The height of signs shall be not more than 2.20 m and, outside built-up areas, not less than 0.60 m.

### Article  47  

1.  If a signalling system is installed at a level-crossing to give warning of the approach of a train or of the imminent closing of the gates or half-gates, it shall consist either 

(a) subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article, of a flashing red light or two red lights flashing alternately and placed on the same post; such light or lights being accompanied or not being accompanied by a sound signal; or  

(b) of a simple sound signal.     
2. 
(a) All level-crossings equipped with gates or half-gates operated from a box from which the gates are not visible shall be equipped with the signalling system described in paragraph I(a) or in paragraph l(b) above;  

(b) All level-crossings equipped with gates or half-gates operated automatically by the approach of trains shall be equipped with the signalling system described in paragraph l(a) above.     
3.  The signal provided for in paragraph 1 of this article means that no road-user may pass.   
4.  Exceptionally, on roads where the level-crossing is near an intersection equipped with the traffic light signals described in article 53 of this Protocol, the signalling referred to in paragraph 1 of the present article may be replaced either by the three-colour light system described in the aforesaid article 53 or by the amber and red lights only of that system; the amber and red lights shall then have for all road-users the meaning indicated in article 53 for vehicular traffic. In the event of such replacement, the approach sign provided for by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of article 15 may be dispensed with if, by reason of local conditions, it would be difficult to affix it in such a way that it would be sufficiently visible.   
5.  At every level-crossing equipped with gates or half-gates the operation of which is controlled automatically by the approach of a train or is controlled from an operating box from which the gates or half-gates are not visible, the closing movement of the gates or halfgates shall be such that road-users approaching the crossing or already on it when the signalling device comes into operation shall have time to stop before reaching the crossing, or to clear it.   

### Article  48  

At all level-crossings equipped with gates or half-gates, the gates or half-gates shall be kept in operation during the whole period when train services are in operation. Should a level-crossing with gates or half-gates be permanently reclassified as a level-crossing without gates or half-gates, the gates or half-gates shall be removed to avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the users of the road.  

### Article  49  

The devices signalling the approach of trains prescribed in article 47, paragraph l(a) of this Protocol shall be placed in the immediate vicinity of the railway and, if a sign in the form of a Saint Andrew's cross is used, wherever possible on the same post as that sign. Where signalling is automatic, appropriate measures shall be taken to guard against any defect in the working of a signal and to ensure that the signal cannot be misinterpreted if it fails to work or works incorrectly.  

### Article  50  

Level-crossings shall not be without either gates or half-gates and signalling of the approach of trains unless the railway line on both sides of the level-crossing is clearly visible to road-users, having regard, in particular, to the speed of the trains, so that the driver of a vehicle approaching the railway from either side may have time to stop before entering the level-crossing when a train is in sight and road-users who have already entered the crossing when a train appears have time to clear the crossing.  

### PART  IV  

####Signals to be made by traffic police

### Article  51  

Traffic police shall be so equipped and stationed as to be visible to alle road users.  

### Article  52  

1.  Signals to be made by traffic police shall conform to one of the two following systems: 
### *First system* 

Signal A — to indicate ”Stop” to the vehicles approaching the officer from the front: arm raised vertically, palm of the hand to the front. Signal C — to indicate ”Stop” to the vehicles approaching the officer from the rear: arm extended horizontally to the side of the road to which the traffic concerned is keeping, palm of the hand to the front. Signals A and C may be used simultaneously.   ![10000055606](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055606)
![10000055607](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055607)
![10000055608](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055608)

### *Second system* 

Signal B — to indicate ”Stop” to the vehicles approaching the officer from the front: arm extended horizontally to the side of the road to which the traffic concerned is keeping, palm of the hand to the front. Signal C — to indicate ”Stop” to the vehiclues approaching the officer from the rear: arm extended horizontally to the side of the road to which the traffic concerned is keeping: palm of the hand to the front. Signals B and C may be used simultaneously.   
2.  Under both systems, a beckoning gesture with the hand may be made to call vehicles forward.   

### PART  V  

####Traffic light signals

### Article  53  

1.  The lights of the traffic light signals shall be given the following meaning: 

(a) In a three-coloured system: Red indicates that vehicular traffic must not pass the signal; Green indicates that vehicular traffic may pass the signal; When amber is used after the green signal, it shall be taken as prohibiting vehicular traffic from proceeding beyond the signal unless the vehicle is so close to the signal when the amber signal first appears that it cannot safely be stopped before passing the signal; — When amber is used in conjunction with or after the red signal, it indicates an impending change in the indications of the signal and shall not be taken as permitting verhicular traffic to proceed.  

(b) In the two-colour system: Red indicates that vehicular traffic must not pass the signal; Green indicates that vehicular traffic may pass the signal; The combination of green and red shall have the same meaning as amber after green in the three-colour system.     
2.  When a single amber intermittent light is used, it shall indicate “caution”.   
3.  The lights shall be placed one above the other. As a rule the red light shall be placed at the top and the green light at the bottom. Where an amber light is used, it shall be placed between the red and the green lights.   
4.  When traffic light signals are placed at the side of the carriageway, the height of the lower edge of the lowest light above the carriageway shall normally be not less than 2 m and not more than 3.50 m; where possible, every light signal should be repeated on the opposite side of the intersection. When they are suspended over the carriageway, the height of the lower edge of the lowest light above the carriageway shall be not less than 4.50 m.   

### PART  VI  

####Road markings

### Article  54  

1.  Where a carriageway outside a built-up area has more than two lanes, these shall as a rule be made clearly distinguishable.   
2.  Where a three-lane carriageway outside a built-up area passes through sections where the visibility is not sufficient, or at other danger points, the total width of the carriageway shall be divided only into two lanes.   
3.  Where a carriageway has two lanes in any section where the visibility is not sufficient and at other danger points, the lanes should be clearly distinguishable.   
4.  The marking of lanes as provided for under paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article indicates that under normal traffic conditions no vehicle shall deviate from the lane reserved for traffic proceeding in its direction.   

### Article  55  

1.  Where the edges of the carriageway are defined by means of lights or reflecting devices, two different colours may be used for such lights or devices.   
2.  Either red or orange may be used to indicate the edge of the carriageway on the side of the road of the direction of the traffic, and white to indicate the edge of the carriageway on the opposite side.   
3.  Where lights or reflecting devices are used to indicate the presence of posts or refuges in the carriageway, white or amber colours should be employed.   

### PART  VII

####PROTOCOL NOPENS DE VERKEERSTEKENS

De Staten, Partij bij dit Protocol, verlangend de veiligheid van het wegverkeer te verzekeren en het internationale wegverkeer te vergemakkelijken door een gelijkvormig stelsel van verkeerstekens, zijn de volgende bepalingen overeengekomen:     
### DEEL  I  

####Algemene bepalingen

### Artikel  1  

De Partijen bij dit Protocol aanvaarden het daarin omschreven stelsel van verkeerstekens en verbinden zich hetzelve zo spoedig mogelijk in te voeren. Zij plaatsen daartoe de in dit Protocol opgenomen verkeerstekens zo dikwijls nieuwe tekens geplaatst of de thans bestaande vernieuwd moeten worden. De volledige vervanging van de verkeerstekens, welke niet met het in dit Protocol voorgeschreven stesel overeenkomen, vindt plaats binnen tien jaren na het tijdstip, waarop dit Protocol voor de onderscheidene Partijen in werking treedt.  

### Artikel  2  

De Verdragsluitende Partijen verbinden zich die verkeerstekens, welke weliswaar hetzelfde kenmerkend uiterlijk hebben als een teken, behorend tot het in dit Protocol voorgeschreven stelsel, doch met een andere strekking dan die welke dat verkeersteken in dit stelsel heeft worden gebruikt, te vervangen zodra dit Protocol in werking treedt.  

### DEEL  II  

####Verkeerstekens langs de weg

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

### Artikel  3  

Het internationale stelsel van verkeerstekens langs de weg omvat drie categorieën van tekens en wel: 

a. gevaarstekens;  

b. tekens, welke een bepaald voorschrift weergeven, onderscheiden in: 

1. verbodstekens;  

2. gebodstekens.    

c. tekens, welke een enkele aanduiding inhouden, onderscheiden in: 

1. aanwijzingstekens;  

2. richtingvooraanduidings- en richtingaanduidingstekens;  

3. plaatsaanduidings- en wegaanduidingstekens.      

### Artikel  4  

Voor elke categorie van tekens heeft het verkeersbord een afzonderlijke vorm.  

### Artikel  5  

1.  De symbolen van de verkeerstekens, zoals deze in de bij dit Protocol behorende tabellen zijn weergegeven, worden door de Partijen aanvaard als de grondslag voor hun verkeerstekens langs de weg. Als regel blijven de tekens binnen de omlijning van het verkeersbord.   
2.  Zo dikwijls de Partijen het nodig oordelen de symbolen te wijzigen, moeten de wijzigingen van dien aard zijn, dat zij het wezenlijke kenmerk der symbolen niet aantasten.   
3.  Ter verduidelijking van de tekens mogen toelichtende mededelingen worden gedaan op een onder het verkeersbord aangebracht rechthoekig bord.   
4.  Zo dikwijls in de tekens zelf of op de aanvullingsborden een opschrift wordt gebezigd, luidt dit in de nationale taal of talen, alsmede desgewenst in een der officiële talen van de Verenigde Naties. De bepalingen van dit lid zijn niet van toepassing op het opschrift „stop” als bedoeld in artikel 33, lid 2.   
5.  Nieuwe tekens, door de Partijen ingevoerd overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste lid van artikel 17 van het op 19 September 1949 te Genève voor ondertekening opengestelde Verdrag nopens het wegverkeer worden aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties medegedeeld, die alle Partijen daarvan kennis geeft.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  Voor de tekens, symbolen en opschriften worden de in dit Protocol voorgeschreven kleuren gebruikt, tenzij bijzondere omstandigheden de toepassing er van verhinderen.   
2.  Wanneer de keuze der kleuren vrij is, past elk land voor eenzelfde categorie van tekens, gebruikt onder gelijke omstandigheden, dezelfde kleuren toe.   
3.  De keerzijde der verkeersborden draagt een neutrale kleur behoudens voorzoveel betreft de borden, weergegeven onder III, C, 1 *a* en III, C, 1 *b* en het symbool, weergegeven onder II, A, 15 indien dit aan de keerzijde van het onder II, A, 14 weergegeven bord is aangebracht.   

### Artikel  7  

Het gebruik van lichten of van reflecterende materialen of voorwerpen wordt tenminste aanbevolen voor gevaarstekens en tekenswaarmede bepaalde aanwijzingen worden gegeven, wanneer het gebruik daarvan des nachts bijdraagt tot de zichtbaarheid van verkeerstekens langs de weg; doch zij mogen de weggebruikers niet verblinden of de duidelijkheid van het symbool of van het opschrift nadelig beïnvloeden.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  De afmetingen der verkeersborden zijn zodanig, dat het teken op een afstand goed zichtbaar is en goed begrijpelijk van nabij.   
2.  Ter verzekering van de grootst mogelijke eenvormigheid zijn de afmetingen der onderscheidene tekens in elk land genormaliseerd. Als regel worden voor elk soort verkeersteken twee formaten gebruikt, te weten een standaard formaat en een verkleind formaat ten gebruike onder omstandigheden, welke de opstelling van het standaard formaat verhinderen of zo dikwijls de veiligheid der weggebruikers zulks niet vereist. Onder bijzondere omstandigheden mag binnen bebouwde kommen of ter herhaling van het hoofdteken een speciaal klein formaat teken worden gebruikt.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Buiten bebouwde kommen bedraagt de afstand tussen de midden loodlijn van het verkeersbord en de naastbijzijnde kant van de rijweg ten hoogste 2 meter, tenzij bijzondere omstandigheden zulks verhinderen.   
2.  Binnen bebouwde kommen en in bergachtige streken bedraagt de afstand tussen de naar de rijweg gekeerde rand van het verkeersbord en een op de kant van de rijweg opgerichte verticale lijn tenminste 50 centimeter. In bijzondere omstandigheden mag deze afstand evenwel kleiner zijn.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  In dit Protocol betekent de hoogte van verkeersborden boven de grond: de hoogte, gemeten van de benedenzijde van het bord tot het door de weg gaande horizontale vlak.   
2.  Voorzoveel mogelijk wordt langs eenzelfde weg een gelijke hoogte in acht genomen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Categorie I. Gevaarstekens

### Artikel  11  

1.  De borden voor de gevaarstekens hebben de vorm van een gelijkzijdige driehoek met één punt omhoog gericht, behalve dat voor het teken *nadering voorrangsweg* (I, 22), waarvan één punt omlaag is gericht.   
2.  Deze verkeersborden hebben een rode rand om een witte of gele achtergrond. De symbolen zijn zwart, althans donker van kleur.   
3.  Voor tekens van het standaard formaat bedraagt de lengte van elke zijde van de driehoek tenminste 90 centimeter; van het verkleinde formaat tenminste 60 centimeter.   
4.  De tekens zijn aangebracht aan de wegzijde, waarlangs het verkeer, waarop zij betrekking hebben, nadert en zijn het verkeer tegemoet gewend. Zij mogen aan de andere zijde van de weg worden herhaald.   
5.  Voorzover hierna in dit Protocol niet anders wordt bepaald, zijn de tekens aangebracht op een afstand van tenminste 150 en ten hoogste 250 meter van het gevaarlijke punt, waarop zij doelen, tenzij zulks ten gevolge van plaatselijke omstandigheden onuitvoerbaar is. In dergelijke uitzonderingsgevallen wordt het teken aangebracht op minder dan 150 meter afstand, doch zo ver mogelijk verwijderd van het gevaarlijke punt en worden bijzondere voorzieningen getroffen.   
6.  De hoogte der tekens bedraagt ten hoogste 2.20 meter en, buiten bebouwde kommen, tenminste 60 centimeter.   
7.  De tekens zijn zo aangebracht, dat zij niet aan het oog kunnen worden onttrokken en geen hinder aan voetgangers kunnen berokkenen.   

### Artikel  12  

Het teken „UITHOLLING OVERDWARS” (I, 1) wordt gebruikt, waar het bevoegde gezag zulks nodig oordeelt ter aanduiding van de nadering van weggedeelten waarvan het wegdek oneffen is, van een dwars over de weg lopende goot of greppel of van een bult in de weg of een hoge brug.   ![10000055536](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055536)

### Artikel  13  

1.  Het teken *gevaarlijke bocht* of *gevaarlijke bochten* (I, 2) wordt slechts gebruikt ter aanduiding van de nadering van een bocht of van bochten, welke gevaarlijk zijn door hun uiterlijke eigenschappen of door gebrek aan zicht.   ![10000055420](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055420)

2.  Ter vervanging van het hierboven bedoelde teken mag elk der Partijen tekens kiezen, welke een duidelijker aanduiding van de bocht of bochten inhouden. Zulk een vervanging is voor het gehele grondgebied van de betrokken Partij van toepassing. Deze vervangende tekens zijn: 

I, 3 — bocht naar rechts;  

I, 4 — bocht naar links;  

I, 5 — S-bocht, eerst naar rechts;  

I, 6 — S-bocht, eerst naar links.     ![10000055421](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055421)

![10000055424](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055424)

### Artikel  14  

1.  Het teken *kruispunt* (I, 7) wordt gebruikt, waar het bevoegde gezag zulks nodig oordeelt ter aanduiding van de nadering van een splitsing, een kruising of een vereniging van wegen.

Waar het bevoegde gezag zulks noodzakelijk acht kan een verticaal bord, dat drie rode balken, schuin gericht en tegen een witte of gele achtergrond vertoont, worden aangebracht onder een teken van het type I, 8 of I, 9, mits borden van dezelfde vorm, welke onderscheidenlijk twee rode balken en een rode balk, schuin gericht en tegen een witte of gele achtergrond vertonen, als afzonderlijke tekens op ongeveer tweederde en op eenderde van de afstand tussen het eerste teken en de spoorbaan zijn aangebracht. De figuren I, 8 *a*, I, 9 *a*, I, 8/9 *b* en I, 8/9 *c* zijn voorbeelden van deze borden.   ![10000055602](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055602)

### Artikel  47  

1.  Wanneer bij een spoorwegovergang een signaalinrichting is aangebracht om te waarschuwen dat een trein nadert of de afsluitbomen of de halve afsluitbomen op het punt staan te worden gesloten, bestaat de inrichting: 

(a) onder inachtneming van het in lid 4 van dit artikel bepaalde, in een rood flikkerlicht of in twee rode afwisselende flikkerende en aan dezelfde stijl aangebrachte lichten; dit licht of deze lichten worden al dan niet door een geluidssignaal begeleid; of  

(b) in een eenvoudig geluidssignaal.     
2.  

(a) Alle spoorwegovergangen, voorzien van afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen, welke worden bediend van een plaats vanwaar de spoorbomen niet zichtbaar zijn, zijn voorzien van een signaalinrichting als hierboven omschreven in lid 1 (a) of in lid 1 (b).  

(b) Alle spoorwegovergangen, voorzien van afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen, welke automatisch door de nadering van een trein worden bediend, zijn voorzien van een signaalinrichting als hierboven omschreven in lid 1 (a).     
3.  Het signaal bedoeld in lid 1 van dit artikel betekent dat geen enkele weggebruiker de spoorbaan mag oversteken.   
4.  Op wegen waar de spoorwegovergang zich bij een kruispunt bevindt, dat is voorzien van de in artikel 53 van dit Protocol omschreven lichtsignalen ten behoeve van het verkeer, kunnen in uitzonderingsgevallen de signalen, genoemd in lid 1 van dit artikel worden vervangen door het in artikel 53 omschreven stelsel met drie kleuren of uitsluitend door de gele en rode lichten van dat stelsel; in dat geval hebben de gele en rode lichten voor alle weggebruikers de betekenis welke daaraan in artikel 53 met betrekking tot voertuigen wordt gegeven. Bij een vervanging als hierboven bedoeld kan het in lid 1 of lid 2 van artikel 15 omschreven naderingsteken vervallen indien, tengevolge van plaatselijke omstandigheden, het moeilijk zou zijn dit op zodanige wijze te bevestigen dat het voldoende zichtbaar is.   
5.  Op elke spoorwegovergang, voorzien van afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen, welke automatisch worden bediend door de nadering van een trein of welke worden bediend van een plaats vanwaar de afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen niet zichtbaar zijn, is de snelheid waarmede de afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen worden gesloten, zodanig dat weggebruikers die de spoorwegovergang naderen of er zich reeds op bevinden wanneer het signaaltoestel in werking treedt, tijdig kunnen stilhouden alvorens zij de spoorwegovergang bereiken, of in de gelegenheid zijn deze tijdig te verlaten.   

### Artikel  48  

Bij alle spoorwegovergangen, voorzien van afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen, worden de afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen doorlopend bediend zolang er treinverkeer plaatsvindt. Wordt de hoedanigheid van spoorwegovergang met afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen duurzaam vervangen door die van onbewaakte overgang, dan worden de spoorbomen of halve spoorbomen verwijderd, teneinde elk misverstand van de zijde der weggebruikers te voorkomen.  

### Artikel  49  

De apparaten welke overeenkomstig de voorschriften van artikel 47, lid 1 (a) van dit Protocol de nadering van een trein aankondigen, worden in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van de spoorbaan aangebracht en, indien een teken in de vorm van het Andreaskruis wordt gebruikt, zo mogelijk aan dezelfde stijl als dit teken bevestigd. Wanneer de signalen automatisch worden gegeven, worden afdoende maatregelen genomen om defect raken van een signaal te voorkomen, alsmede om elke mogelijkheid tot misverstaan van de strekking van het signaal uit te sluiten, indien dit niet of gebrekkig werkt.  

### Artikel  50  

Spoorwegovergangen zijn niet zonder afsluitbomen of halve afsluitbomen, noch zonder signalen welke de nadering van een trein aankondigen, tenzij de spoorbaan van beide zijden van de overgang voor de weggebruikers duidelijk zichtbaar is, waarbij in het bijzonder rekening wordt gehouden met de snelheid der treinen, zodat de bestuurder van een voertuig, van welke zijde hij de spoorbaan ook nadert, tijd heeft voor de spoorwegovergang stil te houden, wanneer er een trein in zicht is en de weggebruikers die zich bij de nadering van een trein reeds op de overweg bevinden, de overgang tijdig kunnen verlaten.  

### DEEL  IV  

####Tekens, te geven door de verkeerspolitie

### Artikel  51  

Verkeersagenten zijn zodanig toegerust en opgesteld, dat zij voor alle weggebruikers zichtbaar zijn.  

### Artikel  52  

1.  De door de verkeersagenten te geven tekens stemmen overeen met een der twee volgende stelsels. 
### *Eerste stelsel* 

Teken A — stopteken voor voertuigen, welke de verkeersagent van voren naderen: omhoog gestrekte arm met de handpalm naar voren gekeerd. Teken C — stopteken voor voertuigen, welke de verkeersagent van achteren naderen: een arm zijwaarts gestrekt naar de kant van de rijbaan, waarlangs het betrokken verkeer nadert, met de handpalm naar voren gekeerd. De tekens A en C mogen gelijktijdig worden gebruikt.   ![10000055484](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055484)
![10000055485](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055485)
![10000055486](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055486)

### *Tweede stelsel* 

Teken B — stop teken voor voertuigen, welke de verkeersagent van voren naderen: een arm zijwaarts gestrekt naar de kant van de rijbaan, waarlangs het betrokken verkeer nadert, met de handpalm naar voren gekeerd. Teken C — stopteken voor voertuigen, welke de verkeersagent van achteren naderen: een arm zijwaarts gestrekt naar de kant van de rijbaan, waarlangs het betrokken verkeer nadert, met de handpalm naar voren gekeerd. De tekens B en C mogen gelijktijdig worden gebruikt.   
2.  Bij beide stelsels mag een wenkend gebaar met de hand worden gemaakt om voertuigen te doen voortgaan.   

### DEEL  V  

####Lichtsignalen ten behoeve van het verkeer

### Artikel  53  

1.  De lichten van de lichtsignalen ten behoeve van het verkeer hebben de volgende betekenis: 

a. Bij een stelsel met drie kleuren betekent rood licht, dat voertuigen het signaal niet voorbij mogen rijden en groen licht, dat voertuigen het signaal voorbij mogen gaan; geel licht, wanneer het gebruikt wordt na het groene licht, dat voertuigen het signaal niet voorbij mogen rijden, tenzij het voertuig bij het aangaan van het gele licht het signaal zo dicht is genaderd, dat het uit veiligheidsoogpunt niet meer kan stilhouden vóór het signaal; geel licht, wanneer het wordt gebruikt te zamen met of na het rode licht, dat een verandering van de aanwijzing van het signaal op handen is en niet, dat voertuigen mogen doorrijden.  

b. Bij een stelsel met twee kleuren betekent rood licht, dat voertuigen het signaal niet voorbij mogen rijden; groen licht, dat voertuigen het signaal voorbij mogen rijden; rood licht, dat verschijnt, terwijl het groene licht blijft branden, hetzelfde als het gele licht, dat op het groene volgt bij het stelsel met drie kleuren.     
2.  Wanneer een enkel geel knipperlicht wordt gebruikt, betekent dit: „voorzichtig!”.   
3.  De verschillende lichten zijn boven elkaar aangebracht. Als regel is het rode licht boven en het groene licht beneden aangebracht. Bij gebruik van een geel licht is dit laatste tussen het rode en het groene licht aangebracht.   
4.  Wanneer lichtsignalen ter zijde van de rijweg zijn aangebracht, bedraagt de afstand tussen de benedenrand van het laagste licht en de rijweg als regel ten minste 2 meter en ten hoogste 3,50 meter; voor zoveel mogelijk behoort elk lichtsignaal aan de overzijde van het kruispunt te worden herhaald. Wanneer de signalen boven de rijweg zijn aangebracht, bedraagt de afstand tussen de benedenrand van het laagste licht en de rijweg ten minste 4,50 meter.   

### DEEL  VI  

####Op het wegdek aangebrachte tekens

### Artikel  54  

1.  Wanneer een rijbaan buiten een bebouwde kom in meer dan twee rijstroken is verdeeld, behoren deze duidelijk te onderscheiden te zijn.   
2.  Wanneer een rijbaan met drie rijstroken buiten een bebouwde kom gedeelten bevat, waar het zicht onvoldoende is, dan wel bij andere gevaarlijke punten, wordt de totale breedte van de rijbaan slechts in tweeën verdeeld.   
3.  Op gedeelten van een rijbaan met twee rijstroken, waar het zicht onvoldoende is, alsmede op andere gevaarlijke punten, behoren de rijstroken duidelijk te onderscheiden te zijn.   
4.  Het aangeven van rijstroken als bepaald in het tweede en derde lid betekent, dat een voertuig onder normale verkeersomstandigheden de voor zijn richting bestemde rijstrook niet behoort te verlaten.   

### Artikel  55  

1.  Wanneer de kanten van de rijbaan door middel van lichten of reflectoren zijn aangegeven, kunnen daartoe twee verschillende kleuren worden gebruikt.   
2.  Rood of oranje kunnen worden gebruikt om de kant van de rijbaan aan te geven aan de wegzijde, waarlangs het betrokken verkeer nadert en wit ter aanduiding van de kant van de rijbaan aan de overzijde.   
3.  Bij gebruik van lichten of reflectoren ter aanduiding van de aanwezigheid van verkeerszuilen of vluchtheuvels op de rijbaan verdienen wit en geel de voorkeur.   

### DEEL  VII  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  56  

1.  Dit Protocol is tot 31 December 1949 opengesteld voor ondertekening door de Staten, welke het op 19 September 1949 te Genève voor ondertekening opengestelde Verdrag nopens het wegverkeer hebben ondertekend.   
2.  Dit Verdrag wordt bekrachtigd. De bekrachtigingsoorkonden worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties.   
3.  Met ingang van 1 Januari 1950 is dit Protocol opengesteld voor toetreding door Staten, welke het Verdrag nopens het wegverkeer hebben ondertekend, alsmede door Staten, welke daartoe toetreden of daartoe toegetreden zijn. Het Protocol is eveneens opengesteld voor toetreding voor en namens afhankelijke gebieden, waarvan de Verenigde Naties het besturend lichaam vormen, indien eveneens toetreding tot het Verdrag voor en namens het betrokken afhankelijke gebied heeft plaats gevonden.   
4.  Toetreding geschiedt door nederlegging van een toetredingsoorkonde bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  57  

1.  Elke Staat kan bij de ondertekening, de bekrachtiging of de toetreding, alsook te allen tijde daarna in een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties gerichte kennisgeving verklaren, dat de bepalingen van dit Protocol mede van toepassing zullen zijn voor één of meer der gebieden, voor welker buitenlandse betrekkingen hij verantwoordelijk is. Deze bepalingen worden voor de in de kennisgeving genoemde gebieden van toepassing dertig dagen na ontvangst dier kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal of, bijgeval het Protocol op dat tijdstip nog niet in werking is getreden, op het tijdstip van in werking treden van het Protocol.   
2.  Voor zover de omstandigheden zulks toelaten verbinden de Partijen zich zo spoedig mogelijk de nodige maatregelen te treffen, ten einde de toepasselijkheid van dit Protocol uit te strekken tot de gebieden, voor welker buitenlandse betrekkingen zij verantwoordelijk zijn, behoudens, voor zover om grondwettelijke redenen vereist, de toestemming van de Regering dier gebieden.   
3.  Elke Staat, welke overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel een verklaring heeft afgelegd, waarbij dit Protocol van toepassing wordt verklaard voor een gebied, voor welks buitenlandse betrekkingen hij verantwoordelijk is, kan te allen tijde daarna in een tot de Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties gerichte kennisgeving verklaren, dat dit Protocol niet langer van toepassing zal zijn voor het in die kennisgeving genoemde gebied. In dat geval zal het Protocol na verstrijken van een jaar sinds de datum der kennisgeving ophouden voor dat gebied van toepassing te zijn.   

### Artikel  58  

Dit Protocol treedt in werking vijftien maanden na nederlegging van de vijfde bekrachtigings- of toetredingsoorkonde. Voor Staten, welke na dat tijdstip dit Protocol bekrachtigen of daartoe toetreden, treedt het in werking vijftien maanden na nederlegging van hun bekrachtigings- of toetredingsoorkonde. De Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties stelt de Staten, welke dit Protocol hebben ondertekend of daartoe zijn toegetreden, alsmede andere Staten, welke waren uitgenodigd tot bijwoning van de conferentie van de Verenigde Naties voor wegverkeer en verkeer met motorrijtuigen, in kennis van het tijdstip, waarop dit Protocol in werking treedt.  

### Artikel  59  

Door dit Protocol te bekrachtigen of daartoe toe te treden, verbindt elke Staat, welke Partij is bij het op 30 Maart 1931 te Genève voor ondertekening opengestelde Verdrag tot het brengen van eenheid in de verkeerstekens, zich dat Verdrag op te zeggen binnen drie maanden na het tijdstip van nederlegging van zijn bekrachtigings- of toetredingsoorkonde ter zake van dit Protocol.  

### Artikel  60  

1.  Elk der Verdragsluitende Staten kan een of meer wijzigingen van dit Protocol voorstellen. Van de tekst van een voorgestelde wijziging wordt kennis gegeven aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die hem aan alle Partijen bij dit Protocol doet toekomen met verzoek binnen vier maanden mede te delen of zij: 

a. verlangen, dat een conferentie ter overweging van de voorgestelde wijziging wordt bijeengeroepen;  

b. de aanvaarding van de voorgestelde wijziging zonder conferentie voorstaan;  

c. de verwerping van de voorgestelde wijziging zonder conferentie voorstaan.   De voorgestelde wijziging wordt door de Secretaris-Generaal eveneens doorgezonden aan alle Staten, niet Partij bij dit Verdrag, welke waren uitgenodigd tot bijwoning van de Conferentie der Verenigde Naties voor wegverkeer en verkeer met motorrijtuigen.   
2.  De Secretaris-Generaal roept een conferentie van de Partijen bij dit Protocol ter overweging van de voorgestelde wijziging bijeen, indien het bijeenroepen van een conferentie wordt verlangd door tenminste eenderde der Partijen. De Secretaris-Generaal nodigt behalve de Partijen bij dit Protocol voor de conferentie uit de Staten, niet Partij bij dit Protocol, welke waren uitgenodigd tot bijwoning van de conferentie der Verenigde Naties voor wegverkeer en verkeer met motorrijtuigen, alsmede Staten, wier deelneming naar het oordeel van de Economische en Sociale Raad gewenst is. De bepalingen van dit lid zijn niet van toepassing ingeval een wijziging van dit Protocol overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van dit artikel is aangenomen.   
3.  Een wijziging van dit Protocol, welke door de conferentie met tweederde meerderheid van stemmen is aangenomen, wordt ter kennis van alle Partijen gebracht ter fine van aanvaarding. Elke wijziging treedt negentig dagen na haar aanvaarding door tweederde gedeelte der Partijen in werking voor alle Partijen behalve die, welke voor het in werking treden verklaren de wijziging niet aan te nemen.   
4.  De conferentie kan ten tijde van de aanneming van een wijziging van dit Protocol met tweederde meerderheid van stemmen besluiten, dat de wijziging van zodanige betekenis is, dat Partijen, welke hebben verklaard haar niet te aanvaarden en zulks niet alsnog binnen een periode van twaalf maanden na het in werking treden van de wijziging doen, na verloop dier periode ophouden Partij bij dit Protocol te zijn.   
5.  Ingeval een tweederde meerderheid der Partijen overeenkomstig het eerste lid onder *b* van dit artikel de Secretaris-Generaal mededeelt de aanvaarding van de wijziging zonder conferentie voor te staan, wordt deze beslissing door de Secretaris-Generaal aan alle Partijen kennis gegeven. De wijziging wordt dan na verloop van negentig dagen na de datum dier kennisgeving van kracht voor alle Partijen, behalve die, welke binnen die periode aan de Secretaris-Generaal mededelen tegen de wijziging bezwaar te hebben.   
6.  Voorzoveel betreft wijzigingen, welke niet onder de werking van het vierde lid van dit artikel vallen, blijven de bestaande bepalingen van kracht voor de Partijen, welke een verklaring overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel hebben afgelegd of overeenkomstig het vijfde lid hun bezwaar tegen de wijziging hebben kenbaar gemaakt.   
7.  Partijen, welke met betrekking tot een wijziging een verklaring overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel hebben afgelegd of overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van hun bezwaar hebben kennis gegeven, kunnen deze verklaring onderscheidenlijk dat bezwaar te allen tijde intrekken door een aan de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving. De wijziging is dan voor de betrokken Partij van kracht met ingang van het tijdstip van ontvangst der kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal.   

### Artikel  61  

Dit Protocol kan met inachtneming van een termijn van een jaar worden opgezegd door een daartoe strekkende kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties, die daarvan mededeling doet aan de Staten, welke het Protocol hebben ondertekend of daartoe zijn toegetreden. Na verloop van deze termijn treedt het Protocol voor de Partij, welke het aldus heeft opgezegd, buiten werking.  

### Artikel  62  

Een geschil tussen twee of meer Partijen, de uitleg of de toepassing van dit Protocol betreffende, hetwelk zij door onderhandeling noch anderzins kunnen oplossen, kan door elk der betrokken Partijen schriftelijk bij het Internationale Gerechtshof ter beslissing aanhangig worden gemaakt.  

### Artikel  63  

Geen bepaling van dit Protocol wordt geacht de Partijen te beletten de maatregelen te nemen, welke zij voor hun buiten- of binnenlandse veiligheid noodzakelijk achten, voorzoveel die maatregelen verenigbaar zijn met het Handvest der Verenigde Naties en beperkt blijven tot de vereisten der gegeven omstandigheden.  

### Artikel  64  

1.  Afgezien van de kennisgevingen ingevolge artikel 5, lid 5, artikel 58, artikel 60, leden 1, 3 en 5 en artikel 61, stelt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties de in het eerste lid van artikel 56 bedoelde Staten in kennis van: 

a. ondertekeningen, bekrachtigingen en toetredingen overeenkomstig artikel 56;  

b. kennisgevingen overeenkomstig artikel 57 met betrekking tot de toepasselijkheid van dit Protocol voor bepaalde gebieden;  

c. verklaringen, waarbij Staten overeenkomstig het derde lid van artikel 60 wijzigingen van het Protocol aanvaarden;  

d. bezwaren tegen wijzigingen van het Protocol, door Staten overeenkomstig het vijfde lid van artikel 60 ter kennis van de Secretaris-Generaal gebracht;  

e. het tijdstip van in werking treden van wijzigingen van het Protocol overeenkomstig het derde en vijfde lid van artikel 60;  

f. het tijdstip, waarop een Staat overeenkomstig het vierde lid van artikel 60 heeft opgehouden Partij bij het Protocol te zijn;  

g. het intrekken van bezwaren tegen een wijziging overeenkomstig het zevende lid van artikel 60;  

h. de lijst van Staten, gebonden door een wijziging van het Protocol;  

i. opzeggingen van het Verdrag tot het brengen van eenheid in de verkeerstekens van 30 Maart 1931 overeenkomstig artikel 59 van dit Protocol;  

j. opzeggingen van dit Protocol overeenkomstig artikel 61.     
2.  Het origineel van dit Protocol wordt nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal, die aan de in het eerste lid van artikel 56 bedoelde Staten gewaarmerkte afschriften ervan doet toekomen.   
3.  De Secretaris-Generaal is gemachtigd dit Protocol bij het in werking treden te registreren.   

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekende vertegenwoordigers, nadat zij elkander hun volmachten hebben overgelegd en deze in goede en behoorlijke vorm hebben bevonden, dit Protocol hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te Genève, de 19de September negentienhonderd negen en veertig in één exemplaar in de Engelse en Franse taal, zijnde beide teksten gelijkelijk authentiek.
