####Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime

Preambule The States Parties to this Protocol, Declaring that effective action to prevent and combat the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air requires a comprehensive international approach, including cooperation, the exchange of information and other appropriate measures, including socio-economic measures, at the national, regional and international levels, Recalling General Assembly resolution 54/212 of 22 December 1999, in which the Assembly urged Member States and the United Nations system to strengthen international cooperation in the area of international migration and development in order to address the root causes of migration, especially those related to poverty, and to maximize the benefits of international migration to those concerned, and encouraged, where relevant, interregional, regional and subregional mechanisms to continue to address the question of migration and development, Convinced of the need to provide migrants with humane treatment and full protection of their rights, Taking into account the fact that, despite work undertaken in other international forums, there is no universal instrument that addresses all aspects of smuggling of migrants and other related issues, Concerned at the significant increase in the activities of organized criminal groups in smuggling of migrants and other related criminal activities set forth in this Protocol, which bring great harm to the States concerned, Also concerned that the smuggling of migrants can endanger the lives or security of the migrants involved, Recalling General Assembly resolution 53/111 of 9 December 1998, in which the Assembly decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental ad hoc committee for the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive international convention against transnational organized crime and of discussing the elaboration of, inter alia, an international instrument addressing illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants, including by sea, Convinced that supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime with an international instrument against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air will be useful in preventing and combating that crime, Have agreed as follows:

PREAMBULE De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Protocol, Verklarend dat doeltreffende maatregelen ter voorkoming en bestrijding van de smokkel van migranten over land, over zee en door de lucht een alomvattende internationale aanpak vereist, met inbegrip van samenwerking, de uitwisseling van informatie en andere passende maatregelen, waaronder sociaal-economische maatregelen, op nationaal, regionaal en internationaal niveau, In herinnering roepend resolutie 54/212 van de Algemene Vergadering van 22 december 1999, waarin de Vergadering de lidstaten en het systeem van de Verenigde Naties aanspoorde de internationale samenwerking op het gebied van internationale migratie en ontwikkeling te intensiveren teneinde de oorzaken aan te pakken die ten grondslag liggen aan migratie, in het bijzonder die welke verband houden met armoede, en de voordelen van internationale migratie voor de betrokkenen te optimaliseren, en, waar relevant, internationale, regionale en subregionale mechanismen aanmoedigde zich te blijven inzetten voor de kwestie van migratie en ontwikkeling, Overtuigd van de noodzaak van een humane behandeling van migranten en de volledige bescherming van hun rechten, Rekening houdend met het feit dat er, ondanks het werk, verricht door andere internationale fora, geen universeel instrument bestaat dat alle aspecten van de smokkel van migranten en aanverwante kwesties aanpakt, Bezorgd over de sterke toename van de activiteiten van criminele organisaties bij het smokkelen van migranten en aanverwante criminele activiteiten als omschreven in dit Protocol, die veel schade berokkenen aan de betrokken Staten, Voorts bezorgd over het feit dat de smokkel van migranten het leven of de veiligheid van de betrokken migranten in gevaar kan brengen, In herinnering roepend resolutie 53/111 van de Algemene Vergadering van 9 december 1998, waarin de Vergadering besloot een „open-ended" intergouvernementele ad hoc-commissie in het leven te roepen ten behoeve van de opstelling van een alomvattend internationaal verdrag tegen grensoverschrijdende georganiseerde misdaad en ter bespreking van de uitwerking van, onder andere, een internationaal instrument dat de illegale handel in en het vervoer van migranten, met inbegrip van over zee, aanpakt, Ervan overtuigd dat aanvulling van het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties tegen grensoverschrijdende georganiseerde misdaad met een internationaal instrument tegen de smokkel van migranten over land, over zee en door de lucht nuttig zal zijn voor de voorkoming en bestrijding van die misdaad, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

1.  Een Staat die partij is die redelijke gronden heeft voor de verdenking dat een schip dat onder zijn vlag vaart of waarvan beweerd wordt dat het in die Staat is ingeschreven, dat geen nationaliteit heeft of dat, hoewel het vaart onder een vreemde vlag of weigert een vlag te voeren, in feite de nationaliteit heeft van de betrokken Staat die partij is, betrokken is bij het smokkelen van migranten over zee, kan de andere Staten die partij zijn verzoeken om bijstand bij het bestrijden van het gebruik van het schip voor dat doel. De Staten die partij zijn, verlenen desgevraagd bijstand voor zover dat binnen hun macht ligt.   
2.  Een Staat die partij is die redelijke gronden heeft voor de verdenking dat een schip dat gebruik maakt van de vrijheid van scheepvaart in overeenstemming met het internationale recht en dat onder de vlag vaart of de registratiekenmerken vertoont van een andere Staat die partij is, betrokken is bij het smokkelen van migranten over zee, kan de Vlaggenstaat daarvan in kennis stellen, verzoeken om bevestiging van de inschrijving, en, bij bevestiging, verzoeken om toestemming van de Vlaggenstaat om passende maatregelen te nemen ten aanzien van dat schip. De Vlaggenstaat kan de verzoekende Staat toestemming geven onder andere: 

a. aan boord te gaan van het schip;  

b. het schip te doorzoeken; en  

c. indien bewijzen worden gevonden dat het schip betrokken is bij het smokkelen van migranten over zee, passende maatregelen te nemen ten aanzien van het schip en de personen en lading aan boord, zoals toegestaan door de Vlaggenstaat.     
3.  Een Staat die partij is die een maatregel heeft genomen overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, stelt de Vlaggenstaat onverwijld in kennis van de resultaten van die maatregel.   
4.  Een Staat die partij is, beantwoordt met spoed een verzoek van een andere Staat die partij is om te bepalen of een schip waarvan beweerd wordt dat het bij hem is ingeschreven of onder zijn vlag vaart daartoe gerechtigd is, alsmede op een overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel gedaan verzoek om toestemming.   
5.  Een Vlaggenstaat kan, overeenkomstig artikel 7 van dit Protocol, zijn toestemming afhankelijk stellen van tussen hem en de verzoekende Staat overeen te komen voorwaarden, met inbegrip van voorwaarden met betrekking tot verantwoordelijkheid en de reikwijdte van te nemen doeltreffende maatregelen. Een Staat die partij is, neemt geen aanvullende maatregelen zonder de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de Vlaggenstaat, uitgezonderd maatregelen tegen onmiddellijk gevaar voor het leven van personen of maatregelen die voortvloeien uit toepasselijke bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten.   
6.  Elke Staat die partij is, wijst een autoriteit of, waar nodig, autoriteiten aan voor het ontvangen en beantwoorden van verzoeken om bijstand, om bevestiging van inschrijving of van het recht van een schip onder zijn vlag te varen en om toestemming voor het nemen van passende maatregelen.

7.  Een Staat die partij is die redelijke gronden heeft voor de verdenking dat een schip betrokken is bij het smokkelen van migranten over zee en geen nationaliteit heeft of kan worden gelijkgesteld aan een schip zonder nationaliteit, kan aan boord gaan en het schip doorzoeken. Indien bewijs wordt gevonden dat de verdenking bevestigt, neemt die Staat die partij is passende maatregelen in overeenstemming met het toepasselijke nationale en internationale recht.

d. verzekert hij, binnen de beschikbare middelen, dat elke maatregel die ten aanzien van het schip wordt genomen, niet schadelijk is voor het milieu.     
2.  Indien de redenen voor de uit hoofde van artikel 8 van dit Protocol genomen maatregelen ongegrond blijken, wordt het schip schadeloos gesteld voor elk eventueel verlies of elke eventuele schade, mits met het schip geen enkele handeling is verricht die de genomen maatregelen rechtvaardigt.   
3.  Bij elke overeenkomstig dit hoofdstuk aangenomen of uitgevoerde maatregel dient zorgvuldig rekening te worden gehouden met de noodzaak geen belemmering te veroorzaken van of schade te berokkenen aan: 

a. de rechten en verplichtingen en de uitoefening van de rechtsmacht van kuststaten in overeenstemming met het internationale recht van de zee; of  

b. de bevoegdheid van de Vlaggenstaat om rechtsmacht en toezicht uit te oefenen bij bestuurlijke, technische en sociale aangelegenheden betreffende het schip.
