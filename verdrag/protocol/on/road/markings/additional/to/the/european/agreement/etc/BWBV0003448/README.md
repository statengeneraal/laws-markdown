The text of any proposed amendment, accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, shall be transmitted to the Secretary-General, who shall communicate it to all Contracting Parties. The Contracting Parties shall have the opportunity of informing him within a period of twelve months following the date of its circulation whether they: (a) accept the amendment; or (b) reject the amendment; or (c) wish that a conference be convened to consider the amendment. The Secretary-General shall also transmit the text of the proposed amendment to the other States referred to in article 2 of this Protocol.   
2. 
(a) Any proposed amendment communicated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this article shall be deemed to be accepted if within the period of twelve months referred to in the preceding paragraph less than one-third of the Contracting Parties inform the Secretary-General that they either reject the amendment or wish that conference be convened to consider it. The Secretary-General shall notify all Contracting Parties of each acceptance or rejection of any proposed amendment and of requests that a conference be convened. If the total number of such rejections and requests received during the specified period of twelve months is less than one-third of the total number of Contracting Parties, the Secretary-General shall notify all Contracting Parties that the amendment will enter into force six months after the expiry of the period of twelve months referred to in paragraph 1 of this article for all Contracting Parties except those which, during the period specified, have rejected the amendment or requested the convening of a conference to consider it.  

(b) Any Contracting Party which, during the said period of twelve months, has rejected a proposed amendment or requested the convening of a conference to consider it may at any time after the end of such period notify the Secretary-General that it accepts the amendment, and the Secretary-General shall communicate such notification to all the other Contracting Parties. The amendment shall enter into force, with respect to the Contracting Party which has notified its acceptance, six months after the date on which the Secretary-General receives the notification.     
3.  If a proposed amendment has not been accepted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article and if within the period of twelve months specified in paragraph 1 of this article less than half of the total number of the Contracting Parties inform the Secretary-General that they reject the proposed amendment and if at least one-third of the total number of Contracting Parties, but not less than five, inform him that they accept it or wish a conference to be convened to consider it, the Secretary-General shall convene a conference for the purpose of considering the proposed amendment or any other proposal which may be submitted to him in accordance with paragraph 4 of this article.   
4.  If a conference is convened in accordance with paragraph 3 of this article, the Secretary-General shall invite to it all the Contracting Parties and the other States referred to in article 2 of this Protocol. He shall request all States invited to the conference to submit to him, at least six months before its opening date, any proposals which they may wish the conference to consider in addition to the proposed amendment and shall communicate such proposals, at least three months before the opening date of the conference, to all States invited to the conference.   
5.

7.  Indepently of the amendment procedure prescribed in paragraphs 1-6 of this article, the annex to this Protocol may be amended by agreement between the competent administrations of all Contracting Parties. If the administration of a Contracting Party states that its national law obliges it to subordinate its agreement to the grant of a specific authorization or to the approval of a legislative body, the competent administration of the Contracting Party in question shall be considered to have consented to the amendment to the annex only at such time as it notifies the Secretary-General that it has obtained the required authorization or approval. The agreement between the competent administrations may provide that, during a transitional period, the former provisions of the annex shall remain in force, in whole or in part, simultaneously with the new provisions. The Secretary-General shall appoint the date of entry into force of the new provisions.   
8.  Each State shall, at the time of signing, ratifying, or acceding to this Protocol, inform the Secretary-General of the name and address of its administration competent in the matter of agreement as contemplated in paragraph 7 of this article.

If the Parties in dispute fail to agree on the choice of an arbitrator or arbitrators within three months after the request for arbitration, any of those Parties may request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a single arbitrator to whom the dispute shall be submitted for decision.   
2.  The award of the arbitrator or arbitrators appointed in accordance with paragraph 1 of this article shall be binding upon the Contracting Parties in dispute.   

### Article  10  

Nothing in this Protocol shall be construed as preventing a Contracting Party from taking such action, compatible with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and limited to the exigencies of the situation, as it considers necessary to its external or internal security.  

### Article  11  

1.  Any State may, at the time if signing this Protocol or of depositing its instrument of ratification or accession, declare that it does not consider itself bound by article 9 of this Protocol.

(b) The length of the strokes of a broken line used for warning in accordance with Article 26, paragraph 2 (a) (ii), of the Convention should be from two to four times the length of the gaps.”   
### *Paragraph 6* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “A continuous line should be not less than 20 m (65 ft.) long.” 
###B. Traffic lane markings

The distinction between (i) “Outside built-up areas” and (ii) “In built-up areas” shall not apply. 
### *Paragraph 8, first sentence* 

This sentence shall read as follows: “On two-way carriageways having two lanes, the centre line of the carriageway should be indicated by a longitudinal marking (diagram A-2).” 
### *Paragraph 9* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “On two-way carriageways having three lanes, the lanes should, as a general rule, be indicated by broken lines (diagram A-3). One or two continuous lines or a broken line adjacent to a continuous line should be used only in specific cases. Two continuous lines may be used on approaches to hill crests, intersections and level crossings and where there is reduced visibility.” 
### *Paragraph 10* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “On two-way carriageways having more than three lanes, the two directions of traffic should be separated by a continuous line, However, on the approaches to level crossings and in other special circumstances, two continuous lines may be used. The lanes shall be marked by broken lines (diagram A-4). When only one continuous line is used it shall be wider than the lane-lines used on the same section of road.” 
### *Paragraph 11* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “If the additional sub-paragraph inserted after Article 26, paragraph 2 (b), of the Convention is applied, each edge of the reversible lane(s) may be marked by a double broken warning line used in conformity with Article 26, paragraph 2 (a) (ii), of the Convention (diagrams A-5 and A-6).” 
### *Additional paragraph to be inserted immediately after paragraph 11* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagram A-7 gives an example of the marking of a one-way road. Diagram A-8 gives an example of the marking of a carriageway of a motorway.” 
### *Paragraph 13* 

The words “diagrams 2 and 3” shall read: “diagram A-31”. 
### *Additional paragraph to be inserted immediately after paragraph 13.* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagrams A-9 and A-10 give examples of the marking of acceleration lanes and of deceleration lanes. Diagram A-11 gives an example of the marking of a combination of an acceleration lane and a deceleration lane”. 
###C. Markings for particular situations

### *Paragraph 14* 

The words “diagram 4” and “diagrams 5 and 6” shall be replaced by “diagram A-33”. 
### *Paragraph 15* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “ ‘Range of vision’ means the distance at which an object of a certain height placed on the carriageway can be seen by an observer on the carriageway whose eye is at the same height or lower. When it is necessary to prohibit the use of the part of the carriageway reserved for oncoming traffic at certain intersections, or at places where the range of vision is restricted (hill crest, bend in the road, etc.) or on sections where the carriageway is narrow or has some other peculiarity, restriction should be imposed, on sections where the range of vision is less than a certain minimum M, by means of continuous lines laid out in accordance with diagrams A-12 to A-19. Where local circumstances make it impossible to use continuous lines, warning lines in conformity with Article 26, paragraph 2 (a) (ii), of the Convention should be used.” <sup> 1)  In view of the present characteristics of motor vehicle design it is suggested that 1 m (3 ft. 4 in.) should be regarded as the height of the eye and 1.20 m (4 ft.) as the height of the object.  </sup> 
### *Paragraph 16* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “The value to be adopted for M varies with road and traffic conditions. In the diagrams A-12 to A-19, A (or D) is the point where the range of vision becomes less than M, while C (or B) is the point where the range of vision again begins to exceed M.” 
### *Paragraph 17* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagrams A-12 (a), A-12 (b), A-13 (a), A-15 and A-16 give examples of the marking of two-lane roads in various cases (bend or vertical curve, existence or absence of a central area where the range of vision exceeds M in both directions).” 
### *Paragraph 18* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “On three-lane roads two methods are possible: 

(a) The carriageway may be reduced to two broader lanes, a procedure which may be regarded as preferable if the road carries a large proportion of two-wheeled vehicles and/or if the section reduced to two lanes is relatively short and remote from any other similar section (diagrams A-12 (c), A-12 (d), A-13 (b), A-17 and A-18).  

(b) To take advantage of the full width of the carriageway, one of the two directions of traffic may be offered two lanes. On vertical curves the privileged direction should be the ascending one. Diagram A-12 (e) gives an example of a hill crest where sections AB and CD do not overlap. Where they do overlap, this type of marking prevents overtaking in the central area where the range of vision is sufficient in both directions. To avoid this the marking of diagram A-13 (c) may be adopted. Diagram A-14 shows the marking of a convex change of slope. The marking is the same whether AB and CD overlap or not. On bends combined with a fairly substantial gradient the same principles may be adopted. On level bends two lanes may be offered to vehicles travelling on the outside of the bend, such vehicles having better visibility when overtaking. Diagram A-19 gives an example of such marking, which is the same whether AB and CD overlap or not.”   
### *Paragraphs 19 to 21* 

The provisions of these paragraphs shall not apply. 
### *Paragraph 22, first sentence* 

This sentence shall read as follows: “In diagrams A-20 and A-21, which show the lines used to indicate a change in width of the available carriageway, and in diagram A-22, which shows an obstacle or the beginning of a central reservation necessitating a deviation of the continuous line(s), the inclination of the line(s) should preferably be 1/50 or less on fast roads and 1/20 or less on roads where speeds do not exceed 60 km/h (37 m.p.h.).” 
### *Paragraph 23* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “A continuous line should be preceded by a warning line in accordance with Article 26, paragraph 2 (a) (ii), of the Convention for a distance of at least 100 m (333 ft.) on fast roads and at least 50 m (166 ft.) on roads where speeds do not exceed 60 km/h. This warning line may be supplemented or replaced by deviation arrows (deflecting arrows). Diagrams A-23 and A-24 give examples of such arrows. Where more than two arrows are used, the distance between successive arrows should diminish as the hazard is approached (diagrams A-25 and A-26).” 
###D. Border lines indicating the limits of the carriageway

### *Paragraph 26* 

### *Additional sentences to be inserted at the end of this paragraph* 

These sentences shall read as follows: “The width of the border line should be at least 0.10 m (4 in.). The width of the border line on a motorway or similar road should be at least 0.15 m (6 in.).” 
###E. Marking of obstructions

### *Paragraph 27* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagrams A-22 and A-27 give examples of the marking to be used near an island or any other obstruction on the carriageway.” 
###F. Guide lines and arrows at intersections

### *Paragraph 28* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: '“At certain intersections, if it is desirable to show drivers how to cross the intersection and how to turn left in countries with righthand traffic or how to turn right in countries with left-hand traffic, guide lines or arrows may be used. The recommended length of strokes and gaps is 0.50 m (1 ft. 8 in.) (diagrams A-28 and A-29). The guide lines shown in diagram A-29 (a) may be supplemented by arrows. The arrows shown in diagram A-29 (b) may be supplemented by guide lines.”  

8. *Ad Annex 8 to the Convention* (Road markings) - *Chapter III* (Transverse markings) 
###B. Stop lines

### *Paragraph 30* 

A reference to diagram A-30 shall be added at the end of this paragraph. 
### *Paragraph 32* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Stop lines may be supplemented by longitudinal lines (diagram A-31). They may also be supplemented by the word “STOP” inscribed on the carriageway (diagram A-32).” 
###C. Line indicating points at which drivers must give way

### *Paragraph 33* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “The minimum width of the line should be 0.20 m (8 in.) and the maximum width 0.60 m (24 in.) (diagram A-34 (a)). The length of the strokes should be at least twice their width. The line may be replaced by triangles marked side by side on the ground with their vertices pointing towards the driver who is required to give way. The bases of these triangles should measure at least 0.40 m (16 in.) but not more than 0.60 m (24 in.) and their height should be at least 0.60 m (24 in.) but not more than 0.70 m (28 in.) (diagram A-34 (b)).” 
### *Paragraph 35* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “The marking(s) referred to in paragraph 34 above may be supplemented by a triangle drawn on the carriageway as shown in the examples given in diagrams A-34 and A-35.” 
###D. Pedestrian crossings

### *Paragraph 37* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “The space between the stripes marking a pedestrian crossing should be at least equal to the width of the stripes and not more than twice that width: the width of a space and stripe together should be between 0.80 m (2 ft. 8 in.) and 1.40 m (4 ft. 8 in.). The minimum width recommended for pedestrian crossings is 2.50 m (8 ft.) on roads on which the speed limit is 60 km/h (37 m.p.h.) or less (diagram A-36). On other roads the minimum width of pedestrian crossings is 4 m (13 ft.). For safety reasons, pedestrian crossings on such roads should be equipped with traffic light signals.” 
###E. Cyclist crossings

### *Paragraph 38* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Cyclist crossings should be indicated by two broken lines. The broken line should preferably be made up of squares (0.40-0.60) x (0.40-0.60) m [(16-24) x (16-24) in.] separated by gaps equal in length to the side of the squares. The width of the crossings should be not less than 1.80 m (6 ft.) for one-way cycle tracks and not less than 3 m (9 ft. 9 in.) for two-way cycle tracks. On oblique crossings the squares may be replaced by parallelograms with their sides parallel respectively to the centre line of the road and to the centre line of the track (diagram A-37). Studs and buttons should not be used. Diagram A-38 gives an example of an intersection where the cycle track is part of a priority road.”  

9. *Ad Annex 8 to the Convention* (Road markings) - *Chapter IV* (Other markings) 
###A. Lane selection arrow markings

### *Paragraph 39* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “On roads having sufficent traffic lanes to separate vehicles approaching an intersection, the lanes to be used may be indicated by lane selection arrow markings on the surface of the carriageway (diagrams A-39 to A-41). Lane selection arrows may also be used on a one-way road to confirm the direction of traffic. The lane selection arrows should be not less than 2 m (6 ft. 7 in.) long. They may be supplemented by word markings on the carriageway.” 
###B. Oblique parallel lines

### *Paragraph 40* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Oblique parallel lines should be so inclined as to deflect traffic from the area they define. Chevron markings, likewise so inclined as to deflect traffic from the hazard, may be used at points of divergence and convergence (diagram A-42). Diagram A-42 a gives an example of an area which vehicles moving alongside the continuous line must not enter and which vehicles moving alongside the broken line may enter only with care. Diagram A-21 shows the marking of areas entry into which is strictly prohibited.” 
###C. Word markings

### *Paragraph 42* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “The letters and numerals should be considerably elongated in the direction of traffic movement because of the small angle at which they are seen by approaching drivers. Where approach speeds do not exceed 60 km/h (37 m.p.h.) the letters and numerals should be at least 1.60 m (5 ft. 4 in.) in height (diagrams A-43 to A-48). Where approach speeds exceed 60 km/h, the letters and numerals should be at least 2.50 m (8 ft.) in height. Examples of letters and numerals 4 m in height are given in diagram A-49 to A-54.” 
### *Paragraph 43* 

The provision of this paragraph shall not be applied. 
###E. Markings on the carriageway and on adjacent structures

(i)  *Markings indicating parking restrictions*  
### *Paragraph 45* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagrams A-55 and A-56 give examples of markings indicating a prohibition on parking.”  

(ii)  *Marking of obstructions*  
### *Paragraph 46* 

This paragraph shall read as follows: “Diagram A-57 gives an example of a marking on an obstacle. Such markings should take the form of alternate black and white or alternate black and yellow stripes.”

### Artikel  6  

1.  Nadat dit Protocol twaalf maanden van kracht is geweest, kan elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een of meer wijzigingen in dit Protocol voorstellen. De tekst van de wijzigingsvoorstellen, vergezeld van een memorie van toelichting, wordt toegezonden aan de Secretaris-Generaal, die deze ter kennis van alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen brengt. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen hebben de gelegenheid hem, binnen een tijdvak van twaalf maanden te rekenen van de datum van kennisgeving, mede te delen of zij: (a) de wijziging aanvaarden; of (b) de wijziging verwerpen; of (c) wensen dat een conferentie wordt bijeengeroepen ter bestudering van de wijziging. De Secretaris-Generaal doet de tekst van de voorgestelde wijziging tevens toekomen aan alle andere Staten als bedoeld in artikel 2 van dit Protocol.   
2.  

(a) Elke voorgestelde wijziging waarvan overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel kennis is gegeven, wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard, indien, binnen het tijdvak van twaalf maanden bedoeld in het voorgaande lid, minder dan een derde van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de Secretaris-Generaal heeft medegedeeld dat zij de wijziging verwerpen, dan wel dat zij wensen dat een conferentie wordt bijeengeroepen ter bestudering van de wijziging. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in kennis van elke aanvaarding of verwerping van elke voorgestelde wijziging en van verzoeken om een conferentie bijeen te roepen. Indien het totale aantal van dergelijke verwerpingen en verzoeken die gedurende het voorgeschreven tijdvak van twaalf maanden zijn ontvangen minder dan een derde bedraagt van het totale aantal Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, stelt de Secretaris-Generaal alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ervan in kennis dat de wijziging van kracht zal worden zes maanden na afloop van het tijdvak van twaalf maanden bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel en wel voor alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met uitzondering van die welke gedurende het voorgeschreven tijdvak de wijziging hebben verworpen of hebben verzocht een conferentie bijeen te roepen om haar te bestuderen.  

(b) Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die gedurende genoemd tijdvak van twaalf maanden een voorgestelde wijziging heeft verworpen of heeft verzocht een conferentie bijeen te roepen om haar bestuderen, kan te allen tijde na afloop van bedoeld tijdvak de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis stellen dat zij de wijziging aanvaardt en de Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze kennisgeving aan alle andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mede. De wijziging wordt dan ten aanzien van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die kennis heeft gegeven van het aanvaarden daarvan, van kracht zes maanden na de datum waarop de Secretaris-Generaal de kennisgeving heeft ontvangen.     
3.  Indien een voorgestelde wijziging niet is aanvaard overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel en indien binnen het tijdvak van twaalf maanden als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel minder dan de helft van het totale aantal Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen de Secretaris-Generaal heeft medegedeeld dat zij de voorgestelde wijziging verwerpen en indien ten minste een derde van het totale aantal Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, maar niet minder dan vijf, hem mededeelt haar te aanvaarden dan wel wenst dat een conferentie wordt bijeengeroepen om haar te bestuderen, roept de Secretaris-Generaal een conferentie bijeen ten einde de voorgestelde wijziging of ieder ander voorstel te bestuderen, dat hem wordt voorgelegd overeenkomstig het vierde lid van dit artikel.   
4.  Indien een conferentie is bijeengeroepen overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, nodigt de Secretaris-Generaal alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en de andere Staten bedoeld in artikel 2 van dit Protocol daartoe uit. Hij verzoekt alle tot de conferentie uitgenodigde Staten hem uiterlijk zes maanden voor de openingsdatum van de conferentie alle voorstellen voor te leggen die zij behalve de voorgestelde wijziging ook door de conferentie wensen te laten bestuderen en hij deelt dergelijke voorstellen uiterlijk drie maanden voor de openingsdatum van de conferentie mede aan alle tot de conferentie uitgenodigde Staten.   
5.  

(a) Elke wijziging op dit Protocol wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard indien zij is aanvaard door een twee derde meerderheid van de ter conferentie vertegenwoordigde Staten, mits deze meerderheid ten minste twee derde bedraagt van de ter conferentie vertegenwoordigde Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. De Secretaris-Generaal stelt alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen in kennis van het aanvaarden van de wijziging en de wijziging wordt van kracht twaalf maanden na de datum van deze kennisgeving en wel voor alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met uitzondering van die, welke gedurende dit tijdvak de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis hebben gesteld dat zij de wijziging verwerpen.  

(b) Een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die de wijziging gedurende genoemd tijdvak van twaalf maanden heeft verworpen kan de Secretaris-Generaal te allen tijde ervan in kennis stellen dat zij de wijziging aanvaardt, en de Secretaris-Generaal deelt deze kennisgeving mede aan alle andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. De wijziging wordt ten aanzien van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die kennis heeft gegeven van het aanvaarden daarvan, van kracht zes maanden na ontvangst van deze kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal, of aan het eind van genoemd tijdvak van twaalf maanden, welke van eide data het laatst valt.     
6.  Indien de voorgestelde wijziging niet wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel en indien aan de in het derde lid van dit artikel voorgeschreven voorwaarden met betrekking tot het bijeenroepen van een conferentie niet is voldaan, wordt de voorgestelde wijziging geacht te zijn verworpen.   
7.  Onafhankelijk van de wijzigingsprocedure voorgeschreven in het eerste tot en met het zesde lid van dit artikel, kan de Bijlage bij dit Protocol bij overeenkomst tussen de bevoegde administraties van alle Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen worden gewijzigd. Indien de administratie van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij verklaart dat haar nationale wetgeving haar verplicht haar instemming afhankelijk te stellen van de verlening van een bijzondere machtiging of van de goedkeuring van een wetgevend lichaam, wordt de bevoegde administratie van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij beschouwd eerst met de wijziging van de Bijlage te hebben ingestemd op het tijdstip waarop zij de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis heeft gesteld dat zij de vereiste machtiging of goedkeuring heeft verkregen. De overeenkomst tussen de bevoegde administraties kan bepalen dat tijdens een overgangsperiode de vroegere bepalingen van de Bijlage geheel of gedeeltelijk van kracht zullen blijven naast de nieuwe bepalingen. De Secretaris-Generaal bepaalt de datum van inwerkingtreding van de nieuwe bepalingen.   
8.  Elke Staat deelt op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bekrachtiging van of toetreding tot dit Protocol de Secretaris-Generaal de naam en het adres mede van zijn ter zake van de overeenkomst bevoegde administratie zoals bedoeld in het zevende lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  7  

Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan dit Protocol opzeggen door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte schriftelijke kennisgeving. De opzegging wordt van kracht een jaar na de datum van ontvangst van deze kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal. Elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die ophoudt Partij te zijn bij het Verdrag inzake verkeerstekens dat op 8 november 1968 te Wenen voor ondertekening werd opengesteld en bij de Europese Overeenkomst tot aanvulling van dat Verdrag, die op 1 mei 1971 te Genève voor ondertekening werd opengesteld, houdt op dezelfde datum op Partij te zijn bij dit Protocol.  

### Artikel  8  

Dit Protocol houdt op van kracht te zijn indien het aantal Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen gedurende een tijdvak van twaalf achtereenvolgende maanden minder is dan vijf, of op het tijdstip waarop het Verdrag inzake verkeerstekens dat op 8 november 1968 te Wenen voor ondertekening werd opengesteld, of de Europese Overeenkomst tot aanvulling van dat Verdrag, die op 1 mei 1971 te Genève voor ondertekening werd opengesteld, ophoudt van kracht te zijn.  

### Artikel  9  

1.  Elk geschil tussen twee of meer Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Protocol en dat door de partijen bij het geschil niet door onderhandelingen of door andere middelen tot regeling van een geschil kan worden opgelost, wordt onderworpen aan arbitrage indien een der bij het geschil betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zulks verzoekt en wordt hiertoe voorgelegd aan een of meer scheidsmannen die in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de partijen bij het geschil wordt of worden gekozen. Indien de partijen bij het geschil niet binnen drie maanden na het verzoek om arbitrage tot overeenstemming kunnen komen omtrent de keuze van een scheidsman of van scheidsmannen, kan een van die partijen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties verzoeken een enkele scheidsman te benoemen, aan wie het geschil ter oplossing wordt voorgelegd.   
2.  De uitspraak van de overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel benoemde scheidsman of scheidsmannen is bindend voor de bij een geschil betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   

### Artikel  10  

Niets in dit Protocol mag zo worden uitgelegd dat een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij daardoor zou worden belet de maatregelen te nemen die deze Partij noodzakelijk acht voor haar buitenlandse of binnenlandse veiligheid en die verenigbaar zijn met de bepalingen van het Handvest der Verenigde Naties en beperkt blijven tot de vereisten der gegeven omstandigheden.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Elke Staat kan bij de ondertekening van dit Protocol of bij de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding verklaren dat hij zich niet gebonden acht door artikel 9 van dit Protocol. Andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn niet gebonden door artikel 9 met betrekking tot een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een zodanige verklaring heeft afgelegd.   
2.  Elk voorbehoud ten aanzien van dit Protocol, met uitzondering van het voorbehoud bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, is toegestaan, op voorwaarde dat het schriftelijk wordt gemaakt en dat het, indien het is gemaakt voor de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging of van toetreding, in die akte wordt bevestigd.   
3.  Elke Staat stelt bij de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging van dit Protocol of bij toetreding daartoe de Secretaris-Generaal schriftelijk ervan in kennis in hoeverre een voorbehoud gemaakt ten aanzien van het Verdrag inzake verkeerstekens, dat op 8 november 1968 te Wenen voor ondertekening werd opengesteld, of ten aanzien van de Europese Overeenkomst tot aanvulling van dat Verdrag, die op 1 mei 1971 te Genève voor ondertekening werd opengesteld, tevens op dit Protocol van toepassing is. Voorbehouden ten aanzien van het Verdrag inzake verkeerstekens die niet zijn genoemd in de kennisgeving gedaan bij de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging van dit Protocol of bij toetreding daartoe worden als niet van toepassing op dit Protocol beschouwd.   
4.  De Secretaris-Generaal deelt de voorbehouden en kennisgevingen krachtens dit artikel mede aan alle Staten bedoeld in artikel 2 van dit Protocol.   
5.  Elke Staat die een verklaring heeft afgelegd, een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt of een kennisgeving heeft gedaan krachtens dit artikel kan deze te allen tijde intrekken door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving.   
6.  Elk voorbehoud gemaakt overeenkomstig het tweede lid of ter kennis gebracht overeenkomstig het derde lid van dit artikel, 

(a) wijzigt voor de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt of ter kennis gebracht, de bepalingen van het Protocol waarop het voorbehoud betrekking heeft, zulks overeenkomstig de draagwijdte van het voorbehoud;  

(b) wijzigt deze bepalingen in dezelfde mate voor de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen ten aanzien van hun betrekkingen met de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die het voorbehoud heeft gemaakt of ter kennis gebracht.     

### Artikel  12

### *Paragraaf 9* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „Op rijbanen bestemd voor verkeer in beide richtingen met drie rijstroken dienen de rijstroken als algemene regel te zijn aangegeven door onderbroken strepen (diagram A-3). Een of twee doorgetrokken strepen of een onderbroken streep naast een doorgetrokken streep dienen slechts in bepaalde gevallen te worden gebruikt. Twee doorgetrokken strepen kunnen worden gebruikt op toegangswegen tot heuveltoppen, kruisingen en gelijkvloerse oversteekplaatsen en wanneer het zicht beperkt is.” 
### *Paragraaf 10* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „Op rijbanen bestemd voor verkeer in beide richtingen met meer dan drie rijstroken, dienen beide verkeersrichtingen van elkaar te zijn gescheiden door een doorgetrokken streep. Op toegangswegen tot gelijkvloerse oversteekplaatsen en in andere bijzondere omstandigheden kunnen evenwel twee doorgetrokken strepen worden gebruikt. De rijstroken dienen te worden aangegeven door onderbroken strepen (diagram A-4). Wanneer slechts één doorgetrokken streep wordt gebruikt, dient deze breder te zijn dan de rijstrookstrepen die op hetzelfde weggedeelte worden gebruikt.” 
### *Paragraaf 11* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „Indien de toegevoegde alinea ingevoegd na artikel 26, tweede lid, letter (b) van het Verdrag, wordt toegepast, kan elke zijkant van de omkeerbare strook (stroken) worden aangegeven door een dubbele onderbroken waarschuwingsstreep gebruikt overeenkomstig artikel 26, tweede lid, letter (a) onder (ii) van het Verdrag (diagrammen A-5 en A-6).”

###C. Tekens voor bepaalde situaties

### *Paragraaf 14* 

De woorden „diagram 4” en „diagrammen 5 en 6” dienen te worden vervangen door „diagram A-33”. 
### *Paragraaf 15* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „’Gezichtsveld’ betekent de afstand waarop een voorwerp van een bepaalde hoogte, dat op de rijbaan is geplaatst, kan worden gezien door een waarnemer op de rijbaan wiens ogen op dezelfde hoogte of lager zijn. In gevallen waar het nodig is het gebruik van dat deel van de rijbaan te verbieden, dat bestemd is voor verkeer uit tegengestelde richting op bepaalde kruisingen, of daar waar het gezichtsveld is beperkt (heuveltop, bocht in de weg, enz.) of op weggedeelten waar de rijbaan smal is of een andere eigenaardigheid vertoont, dienen beperkingen te worden toegepast voor weggedeelten waar het zicht minder bedraagt dan een zeker minimum M, en wel met behulp van doorgetrokken strepen volgens diagrammen A-12 tot A-19. Wanneer plaatselijke omstandigheden het gebruik van doorgetrokken strepen onmogelijk maken, dienen waarschuwingsstrepen overeenkomstig artikel 26, tweede lid, letter (a) onder (ii), van het Verdrag te worden gebruikt.” <sup> 1)  Gezien de huidige modellen voertuigen wordt voorgesteld 1 m te beschouwen als de hoogte van het oog en 1,20 m als de hoogte van het voorwerp.  </sup> 
### *Paragraaf 16* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „De waarde die voor M dient te worden aangenomen is afhankelijk van de situatie op de weg en de verkeersomstandigheden. In de diagrammen A-12 tot A-19 is A (of D) het punt waar het gezichtsveld kleiner wordt dan M, terwijl C (of B) het punt is waar het gezichtsveld groter wordt dan M.” 
### *Paragraaf 17* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „De diagrammen A-12 (a), A-12 (b), A-13 (a), A-15 en A-16 geven voorbeelden van de aanduiding van wegen met twee rijstroken in verschillende gevallen (bocht of neerwaartse helling, het al dan niet aanwezig zijn van een centraal gebied waar het gezichtsveld groter is dan M in beide richtingen).” 
### *Paragraaf 18* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „Voor wegen met drie rijstroken zijn twee methoden mogelijk: 

(a) de rijbaan kan worden teruggebracht tot twee bredere rijstroken, een werkwijze waaraan de voorkeur kan worden gegeven indien het verkeer op de weg in hoofdzaak bestaat uit tweewielige voertuigen en/of indien het tot twee rijstroken teruggebrachte weggedeelte betrekkelijk kort is en ver verwijderd van een soortgelijk ander weggedeelte (diagrammen A-12 (c), A-12 (d), A-13 (b), A-17 en A-18).  

(b) Om de volledige breedte van de rijbaan te benutten, kunnen aan één van de beide verkeersrichtingen twee stroken worden gegeven. Bij verticale bogen dient de bevoorrechte richting de opwaartse te zijn. Diagram A-12 (e) geeft een voorbeeld van een heuveltop waar de gedeelten AB en CD niet samenvallen. Daar waar zij wel samenvallen, belet deze soort aanduiding het inhalen in het centrale gedeelte waar het gezichtsveld in beide richtingen voldoende is. Ten einde dit te vermijden kan de aanduiding van diagram A-13 (c) worden gebruikt. Diagram A-14 toont de aanduiding van een convexe verandering van een helling. De aanduiding is dezelfde, ongeacht of AB en CD samenvallen. In bochten die gecombineerd zijn met een vrij sterke helling kunnen dezelfde beginselen worden aangehouden. In vlak liggende bochten kunnen twee rijstroken worden gegeven aan voertuigen die aan de buitenzijde van de bocht rijden, daar zulke voertuigen beter zicht hebben wanneer zij inhalen. Diagram A-19 geeft een voorbeeld van zulk een aanduiding, die dezelfde is ongeacht of AB en CD samenvallen.”   
### *Paragrafen 19 tot en met 21* 

De bepalingen van deze paragrafen zijn niet van toepassing. 
### *Paragraaf 22, eerste zin* 

Deze zin wordt als volgt gelezen: „Op diagrammen A-20 en A-21, die de strepen tonen die worden gebruikt om een verandering van de beschikbare breedte van de rijbaan aan te geven, en op diagram A-22 dat een belemmering toont of het begin van een verkeerseiland dat het noodzakelijk maakt van de doorgetrokken streep (strepen) af te wijken, dient de hoek van de streep (strepen) bij voorkeur 1/50 of minder te zijn op wegen waar snel wordt gereden en 1/20 of minder op wegen waar de snelheid 60 km per uur niet te boven gaat.” 
### *Paragraaf 23* 

Deze paragraaf wordt als volgt gelezen: „Een doorgetrokken streep dient te worden voorafgegaan door een waarschuwingsstreep overeenkomstig artikel 26, tweede lid, letter (a), onder (ii) van het Verdrag, over een afstand van ten minste 100 m op wegen waar snel wordt gereden en van ten minste 50 m op wegen waar de snelheid 60 km per uur niet te boven gaat. Deze waarschuwingsstreep kan worden aangevuld of vervangen door afbuigende pijlen. Diagrammen A-23 en A-24 geven voorbeelden van zulke pijlen. Wanneer meer dan twee pijlen worden gebruikt, dient de afstand tussen de achtereenvolgende pijlen kleiner te worden naarmate men het gevaar nadert (diagrammen A-25 en A-26).”
