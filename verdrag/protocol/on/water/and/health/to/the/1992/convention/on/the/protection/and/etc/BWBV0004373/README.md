### Article  5  

####Principles and approaches

In taking measures to implement this Protocol, the Parties shall be guided in particular by the following principles and approaches: 

a) The precautionary principle, by virtue of which action to prevent, control or reduce water-related disease shall not be postponed on the ground that scientific research has not fully proved a causal link between the factor at which such action is aimed, on the one hand, and the potential contribution of that factor to the prevalence of water-related disease and/or transboundary impacts, on the other hand;  

b) The polluter-pays principle, by virtue of which costs of pollution prevention, control and reduction shall be borne by the polluter;  

c) States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction;  

d) Water resources shall be managed so that the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs;  

e) Preventive action should be taken to avoid outbreaks and incidents of water-related disease and to protect water resources used as sources of drinking water because such action addresses the harm more efficiently and can be more cost-effective than remedial action;  

f) Action to manage water resources should be taken at the lowest appropriate administrative level;  

g) Water has social, economic and environmental values and should therefore be managed so as to realize the most acceptable and sustainable combination of those values;  

h) Efficient use of water should be promoted through economic instruments and awareness-building;  

i) Access to information and public participation in decision-making concerning water and health are needed, inter alia, in order to enhance the quality and the implementation of the decisions, to build public awareness of issues, to give the public the opportunity to express its concerns and to enable public authorities to take due account of such concerns. Such access and participation should be supplemented by appropriate access to judicial and administrative review of relevant decisions;  

j) Water resources should, as far as possible, be managed in an integrated manner on the basis of catchment areas, with the aims of linking social and economic development to the protection of natural ecosystems and of relating water-resource management to regulatory measures concerning other environmental mediums. Such an integrated approach should apply across the whole of a catchment area, whether transboundary or not, including its associated coastal waters, the whole of a groundwater aquifer or the relevant parts of such a catchment area or groundwater aquifer;  

k) Special consideration should be given to the protection of people who are particularly vulnerable to water-related disease;  

l) Equitable access to water, adequate in terms both of quantity and of quality, should be provided for all members of the population, especially those who suffer a disadvantage or social exclusion;  

m) As a counterpart to their rights and entitlements to water under private law and public law, natural and legal persons and institutions, whether in the public sector or the private sector, should contribute to the protection of the water environment and the conservation of water resources; and  

n) In implementing this Protocol, due account should be given to local problems, needs and knowledge.

basisbehoeften van de mens noodzakelijk is voor zowel een betere gezondheid als voor duurzame ontwikkeling, Het nut voor de gezondheid en het welzijn van de mens erkennend dat voortvloeit uit gezond en schoon water en een harmonisch en deugdelijk functionerende wateromgeving, Zich ervan bewust dat oppervlaktewateren en grondwater hernieuwbare hulpbronnen zijn met een beperkt vermogen zich te herstellen van de nadelige gevolgen van menselijke activiteiten op hun kwantiteit en kwaliteit, dat iedere nalatigheid deze grenzen te eerbiedigen, kan leiden tot nadelige gevolgen op zowel de korte als de lange termijn voor de gezondheid en het welzijn van degenen die van deze hulpbronnen en hun kwaliteit afhankelijk zijn, en dat dientengevolge duurzaam beheer van de hydrologische kringloop essentieel is om te voorzien in menselijke behoeften en het milieu te beschermen, Zich er tevens van bewust van de gevolgen voor de volksgezondheid van tekorten aan water van een toereikende kwaliteit om te voorzien in de basisbehoeften van de mens en zich bewust van de ernstige gevolgen van dergelijke tekorten, in het bijzonder voor kwetsbare, kansarme en sociaal uitgesloten personen, Zich ervan bewust dat de voorkoming, beheersing en vermindering van aan water gerelateerde ziekten belangrijke taken zijn die alleen afdoende kunnen worden vervuld door nauwere samenwerking op alle niveaus en tussen alle sectoren, zowel binnen landen als tussen Staten, Zich er tevens van bewust dat toezicht op aan water gerelateerde ziekten en de instelling van systemen voor vroegtijdige waarschuwing en bestrijdingssystemen belangrijke aspecten zijn van de voorkoming, beheersing en vermindering van aan water gerelateerde ziekten, Zich baserend op de conclusies van de Conferentie over Milieu en Ontwikkeling van de Verenigde Naties (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), in het bijzonder de Verklaring van Rio inzake milieu en ontwikkeling en Agenda 21, alsmede op het programma voor de verdere implementatie van Agenda 21 (New York, 1997) en het daaruit voortvloeiende besluit van de Commissie inzake Duurzame Ontwikkeling betreffende het duurzaam beheer van zoet water (New York, 1998), Geïnspireerd door de desbetreffende bepalingen van het [Verdrag inzake de bescherming en het gebruik van grensoverschrijdende waterlopen en internationale meren](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/the/protection/and/use/of/transboundary/watercourses/and/etc/BWBV0001174/README.md) van 1992, en benadrukkend dat zowel bredere toepassing van die bepalingen als aanvulling van [dat Verdrag](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/the/protection/and/use/of/transboundary/watercourses/and/etc/BWBV0001174/README.md) met verdere maatregelen ter versterking van de bescherming van de volksgezondheid geboden is, Gelet op het Verdrag inzake milieueffectrapportage in grensoverschrijdend verband van 1991, het [Verdrag inzake de

### Artikel  5  

####Beginselen en benaderingen

Bij het nemen van maatregelen ter uitvoering van dit Protocol worden de Partijen in het bijzonder geleid door de volgende beginselen en benaderingen: 

a. het voorzorgsbeginsel, uit hoofde waarvan ingrijpen ter vermijding, beheersing of vermindering van aan water gerelateerde ziekten niet mag worden uitgesteld om de reden dat het bestaan niet volledig door wetenschappelijk onderzoek is aangetoond van een causaal verband tussen de factor waarop een dergelijk ingrijpen is gericht enerzijds en de mogelijke bijdrage van die factor aan de wijde verspreiding van aan water gerelateerde ziekten en/of grensoverschrijdende effecten anderzijds;  

b. het beginsel dat de vervuiler betaalt, uit hoofde waarvan de kosten van maatregelen ter voorkoming, beheersing en vermindering van verontreiniging worden gedragen door de vervuiler;  

c. Staten hebben, in overeenstemming met het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en de grondbeginselen van het internationale recht, het soevereine recht hun eigen hulpbronnen te exploiteren volgens hun eigen milieu- en ontwikkelingsbeleid, en hebben de verantwoordelijkheid te waarborgen dat activiteiten verricht onder hun rechtsmacht of toezicht geen schade veroorzaken aan het milieu van andere Staten of van gebieden die buiten de grenzen van de nationale rechtsmacht vallen;
