####Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers

The Parties to this Protocol, Recalling article 5, paragraph 9, and article 10, paragraph 2, of the 1998 Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention), Recognizing that pollutant release and transfer registers provide an important mechanism to increase corporate accountability, reduce pollution and promote sustainable development, as stated in the Lucca Declaration adopted at the first meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention, Having regard to principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Having regard also to the principles and commitments agreed to at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in particular the provisions in chapter 19 of Agenda 21, Taking note of the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its nineteenth special session, 1997, in which it called for, inter alia, enhanced national capacities and capabilities for information collection, processing and dissemination, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means, Having regard to the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, which encourages the development of coherent, integrated information on chemicals, such as through national pollutant release and transfer registers, Taking into account the work of the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety, in particular the 2000 Bahia Declaration on Chemical Safety, the Priorities for Action Beyond 2000 and the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register/Emission Inventory Action Plan, Taking into account also the activities undertaken within the framework of the Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals, Taking into account furthermore the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in particular its Council Recommendation on Implementing Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers, in which the Council calls upon member countries to establish and make publicly available national pollutant release and transfer registers, Wishing to provide a mechanism contributing to the ability of every person of present and future generations to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, by ensuring the development of publicly accessible environmental information systems, Wishing also to ensure that the development of such systems takes into account principles contributing to sustainable development such as the precautionary approach set forth in principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Recognizing the link between adequate environmental information systems and the exercise of the rights contained in the Aarhus Convention, Noting the need for cooperation with other international initiatives concerning pollutants and waste, including the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, Recognizing that the objectives of an integrated approach to minimizing pollution and the amount of waste resulting from the operation of industrial installations and other sources are to achieve a high level of protection for the environment as a whole, to move towards sustainable and environmentally sound development and to protect the health of present and future generations, Convinced of the value of pollutant release and transfer registers as a cost-effective tool for encouraging improvements in environmental performance, for providing public access to information on pollutants released into and transferred in and through communities, and for use by Governments in tracking trends, demonstrating progress in pollution reduction, monitoring compliance with certain international agreements, setting priorities and evaluating progress achieved through environmental policies and programmes, Believing that pollutant release and transfer registers can bring tangible benefits to industry through the improved management of pollutants, Noting the opportunities for using data from pollutant release and transfer registers, combined with health, environmental, demographic, economic or other types of relevant information, for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of potential problems, identifying 'hot spots', taking preventive and mitigating measures, and setting environmental management priorities, Recognizing the importance of protecting the privacy of identified or identifiable natural persons in the processing of information reported to pollutant release and transfer registers in accordance with applicable international standards relating to data protection, Recognizing also the importance of developing internationally compatible national pollutant release and transfer register systems to increase the comparability of data, Noting that many member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the European Community and the Parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement are acting to collect data on pollutant releases and transfers from various sources and to make these data publicly accessible, and recognizing especially in this area the long and valuable experience in certain countries, Taking into account the different approaches in existing emission registers and the need to avoid duplication, and recognizing therefore that a certain degree of flexibility is needed, Urging the progressive development of national pollutant release and transfer registers, Urging also the establishment of links between national pollutant release and transfer registers and information systems on other releases of public concern, Have agreed as follows:

De Partijen bij dit Protocol, Herinnerend aan artikel 5, negende lid, en artikel 10, tweede lid, van het Verdrag betreffende toegang tot informatie, inspraak in besluitvorming en toegang tot de rechter inzake milieuaangelegenheden van 1998 (het Verdrag van Aarhus), Erkennend dat registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen een belangrijk mechanisme bieden voor vergroting van de verantwoordelijkheid van bedrijven, terugdringing van vervuiling en bevordering van duurzame ontwikkeling, zoals gesteld in de Verklaring van Lucca, die tijdens de eerste vergadering van de Partijen bij het Verdrag van Aarhus is aangenomen, Gelet op beginsel 10 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling van 1992, Tevens gelet op de beginselen en verplichtingen overeengekomen tijdens de Conferentie van de Verenigde Naties over Milieu en Ontwikkeling van 1992, met name de bepalingen van hoofdstuk 19 van Agenda 21, Gelet op het Programma inzake de verdere implementatie van Agenda 21, in 1997 aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties tijdens de negentiende speciale zitting, waarin zij opriep tot, onder andere, meer nationale capaciteit en mogelijkheden voor het verzamelen, verwerken en verspreiden van informatie, teneinde toegang van de burgers tot informatie over wereldwijde milieukwesties te vergemakkelijken met behulp van passende middelen, Gelet op het implementatieplan van de Wereldtop inzake duurzame ontwikkeling van 2002, waarin de ontwikkeling wordt aangemoedigd van samenhangende, geïntegreerde informatie over chemische stoffen, bijvoorbeeld door middel van registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen, Rekening houdend met het werk van het Intergouvernementeel Forum voor de veiligheid van chemische stoffen, met de name de Verklaring van Bahia inzake de veiligheid van chemische stoffen van 2000, de prioriteiten voor maatregelen na 2000 en het actieplan ten behoeve van registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen/emissie-inventarissen, Tevens rekening houdend met de activiteiten ondernomen in het kader van het interorganisatieprogramma voor het verantwoord beheer van chemische stoffen, Voorts rekening houdend met het werk van de Organisatie voor Economische Samenwerking en Ontwikkeling, met name de Aanbeveling van de Raad betreffende de invoering van registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen, waarin de Raad lidstaten oproept nationale registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen in te stellen en voor het publiek toegankelijk te maken, Geleid door de wens te voorzien in een mechanisme dat ertoe bijdraagt dat iedere persoon, van de huidige en toekomstige generaties, in een milieu kan leven dat geschikt is voor zijn of haar gezondheid en welzijn, door de ontwikkeling te waarborgen van voor het publiek toegankelijke milieu-informatiesystemen, Tevens geleid door de wens te waarborgen dat bij de ontwikkeling van dergelijke systemen rekening wordt gehouden met de beginselen die bijdragen aan duurzame ontwikkeling zoals de voorzorgsbenadering bedoeld in beginsel 15 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling van 1992, Erkennend de relatie tussen adequate milieu-informatiesystemen en de uitoefening van de rechten vervat in het Verdrag van Aarhus, Gelet op de noodzaak met andere internationale initiatieven samen te werken met betrekking tot verontreinigende stoffen en afval, met inbegrip van het Verdrag van Stockholm inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen van 2001 en het Verdrag van Bazel inzake de beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en de verwijdering ervan van 1989, Erkennend dat de doelstellingen van een geïntegreerde aanpak teneinde de verontreiniging en de hoeveelheid afvalstoffen die resulteren uit het exploiteren van industriële installaties en andere bronnen tot een minimum terug te brengen, eruit bestaan een hoge mate van bescherming van het milieu als geheel tot stand te brengen, een duurzame en milieuverantwoorde ontwikkeling te bevorderen, en de gezondheid van de huidige en toekomstige generaties te beschermen, Overtuigd van de waarde van registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen als een kosteneffectief middel om betere milieuprestaties te bevorderen, om het publiek toegang te geven tot informatie over verontreinigende stoffen die vrijkomen in en overgebracht worden naar en door gemeenschappen, en om door regeringen te worden gebruikt voor het identificeren van trends, het aantonen van vooruitgang bij het terugdringen van verontreiniging, het controleren van de naleving van bepaalde internationale verdragen, het stellen van prioriteiten en het evalueren van de vooruitgang die dankzij milieubeleid en –programma’s is geboekt, Van mening dat registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen de industrie concrete voordelen zullen brengen door het verbeterde beheer van verontreinigende stoffen, Gelet op de mogelijkheden de gegevens uit de registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen, in combinatie met gezondheids-, milieu, demografische, economische en andere relevante informatie, te gebruiken om een beter begrip te verwerven van mogelijke problemen, ‘hot spots’ te identificeren, preventieve en mitigerende maatregelen te nemen, en prioriteiten te stellen op het gebied van milieubeheer, Erkennend het belang van het beschermen van de privacy van geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke personen bij het verwerken van informatie die is doorgegeven aan registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen in overeenstemming met van toepassing zijnde internationale normen inzake de bescherming van persoonsgegevens, Tevens erkennend het belang van het ontwikkelen van nationale registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen die op internationaal niveau compatibel zijn teneinde de vergelijkbaarheid van gegevens te vergroten, Gelet op het feit dat veel lidstaten van de Economische Commissie voor Europa van de Verenigde Naties, de Europese Gemeenschap en de Partijen bij de Noord-Amerikaanse Vrijhandelsovereenkomst inspanningen verrichten om gegevens te verzamelen over uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen uit diverse bronnen, en het publiek toegang tot deze gegevens te geven, en met name erkennend de uitgebreide en waardevolle ervaring die bepaalde landen hebben op dit gebied, Rekening houdend met de verschillende benaderingen die bij de bestaande emissieregisters worden gehanteerd en de noodzaak duplicatie te voorkomen, en derhalve erkennend dat een zekere mate van flexibiliteit geboden is, Met klem verzoekend om de gestage ontwikkeling van nationale registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen, Tevens met klem verzoekend om het aanbrengen van koppelingen tussen nationale registers inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen en informatiesystemen inzake overige uitstoten van publiek belang, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

1.  Elke Partij waarborgt dat het publiek toegang krijgt tot de informatie vervat in haar register inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen, zonder dat een bepaald belang behoeft te worden gesteld, en in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Protocol, voornamelijk door te waarborgen dat het register langs elektronische weg middels openbare telecommunicatienetwerken rechtstreeks toegankelijk is.   
2.  Wanneer het publiek de informatie vervat in haar register niet op eenvoudige wijze rechtstreeks kan inzien langs elektronische weg, waarborgt elke Partij dat haar bevoegde autoriteit deze informatie op verzoek langs een andere doelmatige weg beschikbaar stelt, zulks zo spoedig mogelijk en uiterlijk binnen een maand nadat het verzoek is ingediend.   
3.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het vierde lid, waarborgt elke Partij dat toegang tot de informatie vervat in haar register kostenloos is.   
4.  Elke Partij kan haar bevoegde autoriteit toestaan kosten te heffen voor de reproductie en verzending van de in het tweede lid bedoelde specifieke informatie, maar deze vergoeding gaat een redelijk bedrag niet te boven.   
5.  Wanneer het publiek de informatie vervat in haar register niet op eenvoudige wijze rechtstreeks kan inzien langs elektronische weg, zorgt elke Partij ervoor dat haar register langs elektronische weg geraadpleegd kan worden in openbare gelegenheden, bijvoorbeeld openbare bibliotheken, kantoren van plaatselijke autoriteiten of andere daarvoor in aanmerking komende plaatsen.   

### Artikel  12

c. de vertrouwelijkheid van commerciële en industriële informatie, wanneer deze informatie bij wet beschermd wordt om een legitiem economisch belang te beschermen;  

d. intellectuele eigendomsrechten; of  

e. de vertrouwelijkheid van persoonsgegevens en/of –dossiers met betrekking tot een natuurlijke persoon wanneer die persoon niet heeft ingestemd met de bekendmaking van de informatie aan het publiek, wanneer het nationaal recht voorziet in deze vertrouwelijkheid. De bovengenoemde gronden voor vertrouwelijkheid worden restrictief uitgelegd, met inachtneming van het met bekendmaking gediende openbare belang en in aanmerking nemend of de informatie betrekking heeft op uitstoten in het milieu.     
2.  In het kader van het eerste lid, onderdeel c, kan alle informatie met betrekking tot uitstoten die van belang is voor de bescherming van het milieu in aanmerking komen voor bekendmaking in overeenstemming met het nationaal recht.   
3.  Wanneer informatie ingevolge het eerste lid vertrouwelijk blijft, wordt in het register aangegeven welke soort informatie niet bekend wordt gemaakt, indien mogelijk bijvoorbeeld door het verstrekken van generieke informatie over de chemische stoffen, en waarom de informatie niet bekend wordt gemaakt.

3.  Elke Partij waarborgt dat, wanneer een besluit tot het instellen of wezenlijk veranderen van haar register is genomen, het publiek tijdig zal worden geïnformeerd over de beslissing en de overwegingen die daaraan ten grondslag liggen.   

### Artikel  14  

####Toegang tot de rechter

1.  Elke Partij waarborgt, binnen het kader van haar nationale wetgeving, dat eenieder die meent dat zijn of haar verzoek om informatie ingevolge artikel 11, tweede lid, veronachtzaamd, ten onrechte geheel of gedeeltelijk afgewezen, onvoldoende beantwoord of anderszins niet behandeld is in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dat lid, toegang heeft tot een herzieningsprocedure voor een rechterlijke instantie of een ander bij wet ingesteld onafhankelijk en onpartijdig orgaan.   
2.  De vereisten van het eerste lid laten de respectieve rechten en verplichtingen van Partijen uit hoofde van bestaande van toepassing zijnde verdragen tussen hen die betrekking hebben op het onderwerp van dit artikel, onverlet.   

### Artikel  15  

####Capaciteitsopbouw

1.  Elke Partij bevordert de bewustwording van het publiek van haar register inzake de uitstoot en overbrenging van verontreinigende stoffen en waarborgt dat steun en begeleiding worden gegeven bij het verkrijgen van toegang tot het register en het begrijpen en gebruiken van de daarin vervatte informatie.

### Bijlage  IV  

*Arbitrage*  

1. Indien een geschil aan arbitrage wordt onderworpen ingevolge artikel 23, tweede lid, van dit Protocol stelt/stellen een of meer partijen de andere partij of partijen langs diplomatieke weg, alsmede het secretariaat, in kennis van het onderwerp van arbitrage, onder vermelding van de artikelen van dit Protocol over de uitlegging of toepassing waarvan een geschil is ontstaan. Het secretariaat zendt de ontvangen informatie toe aan alle Partijen bij dit Verdrag.  

2. Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden. De eisende partij(en) en de andere partij(en) bij het geschil benoemen elk een arbiter, en de twee aldus benoemde arbiters wijzen met gezamenlijke instemming de derde arbiter aan, die voorzitter van het scheidsgericht wordt. De derde arbiter mag geen onderdaan van een van de partijen bij het geschil zijn, noch mag hij of zij zijn of haar gewone verblijfplaats op het grondgebied van een van die partijen hebben, of in dienst zijn bij een van hen, of in een andere hoedanigheid reeds bij de aangelegenheid betrokken zijn geweest.  

3. Indien de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht niet is aangewezen binnen twee maanden na de benoeming van de tweede arbiter, wijst de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, op verzoek van een van beide partijen bij het geschil, binnen een nieuwe termijn van twee maanden de voorzitter aan.  

4. Indien een van de partijen bij het geschil niet binnen een maand nadat zij het verzoek daartoe heeft ontvangen, een arbiter heeft benoemd, kan de andere partij dit mededelen aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die binnen een nieuwe termijn van twee maanden de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht aanwijst. Vervolgens verzoekt de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht de partij die nog geen arbiter heeft benoemd, dit binnen twee maanden te doen. Indien zij dit binnen dat tijdvak niet doet, deelt de voorzitter dit mede aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die vervolgens binnen een volgend tijdvak van twee maanden de benoeming verricht.  

5. Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing in overeenstemming met het internationale recht en met de bepalingen van dit Protocol.  

6. Ieder krachtens de bepalingen van deze Bijlage ingesteld scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedureregels vast.  

7. De beslissingen van het scheidsgerecht betreffende zowel procedures als aan hem voorgelegde aangelegenheden worden genomen met een meerderheid van stemmen van zijn leden.  

8. Het scheidsgerecht kan alle passende maatregelen nemen ter vaststelling van de feiten.  

9. De partijen bij het geschil doen alles wat in hun vermogen ligt om het werk van het scheidsgerecht te vergemakkelijken, met name door: 

a. het scheidsgerecht alle relevante documenten, voorzieningen en informatie te verstrekken;  

b. het scheidsgerecht indien nodig in staat te stellen getuigen of deskundigen op te roepen en te horen.    

10. De partijen en de arbiters beschermen de vertrouwelijkheid van de informatie die zij gedurende de procedure bij het scheidsgerecht in vertrouwen krijgen.  

11. Het scheidsgerecht kan, op verzoek van een van de partijen, tussentijdse beschermingsmaatregelen aanbevelen.  

12. Indien een van de partijen bij het geschil niet voor het scheidsgerecht verschijnt of haar zaak niet verdedigt, kan de andere partij het scheidsgerecht verzoeken de procedure voort te zetten en zijn uiteindelijke beslissing te nemen. Het feit dat een partij niet voor het scheidsgerecht verschijnt of haar zaak niet verdedigt, vormt geen belemmering voor de voortzetting van de procedure. Alvorens zijn uiteindelijke beslissing te nemen, dient het scheidsgerecht zich ervan te vergewissen dat de eis feitelijk en rechtens gegrond is.  

13. Het scheidsgerecht kan tegeneisen die rechtstreeks voortkomen uit de aangelegenheid die het onderwerp van het geschil is, horen en erover beslissen.  

14. Tenzij het scheidsgerecht anders bepaalt vanwege de bijzondere omstandigheden van de zaak, worden de kosten van het scheidsgerecht, met inbegrip van de honorering van zijn leden, in gelijke delen gedragen door de partijen bij het geschil. Het scheidsgericht houdt een overzicht van al zijn kosten bij, en verstrekt de partijen daarvan een eindopgave.  

15. Iedere Partij bij dit Protocol die een belang van juridische aard heeft bij de aangelegenheid die het onderwerp van geschil is, en waarvoor de beslissing van het scheidsgerecht gevolgen kan hebben, kan zich met de instemming van het scheidsgerecht voegen in de procedure.  

16. Het scheidsgerecht doet zijn uitspraak binnen vijf maanden na de datum waarop het werd ingesteld, tenzij het het noodzakelijk acht deze termijn te verlengen met een termijn van ten hoogste vijf maanden.  

17. De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht dient vergezeld te gaan van een uiteenzetting van de gronden. De uitspraak is onherroepelijk en bindend voor alle partijen bij het geschil. De uitspraak wordt door het scheidsgerecht toegezonden aan de partijen bij het geschil en aan het secretariaat. Het secretariaat zendt de ontvangen informatie toe aan alle Partijen bij dit Protocol.  

18. Ieder geschil dat tussen partijen ontstaat betreffende de uitlegging of tenuitvoerlegging van de uitspraak kan door elk van de partijen worden voorgelegd aan het scheidsgerecht dat de uitspraak heeft gedaan of, indien het daaraan niet kan worden voorgelegd, aan een ander scheidsgerecht dat hiertoe wordt ingesteld op dezelfde wijze als het eerstbedoelde scheidsgerecht.
