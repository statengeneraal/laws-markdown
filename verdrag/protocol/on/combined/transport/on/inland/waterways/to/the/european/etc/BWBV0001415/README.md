### Annex  II  

####Terminals in ports of importance for International Combined Transport

Numbering of terminals in inland waterway ports  

<sup> *)  Terminals are considered to be important for international combined transport if they form together with the respective inland waterways and coastal routes a coherent network for combined transport, and if they are already used for combined transport.  </sup>  

All terminals in inland waterway ports of importance for international combined transport shall have numbers consisting of the number of the waterway they belong to followed by a hyphen followed by two digits corresponding to a port on a specific waterway, numbered in order from west to east and from north to south. Terminals in inland waterway ports contained in the European Agreement on Main Inland Waterways of International Importance (AGN) and in this Protocol shall be preceded by the letters “C-P"; terminals important only for international combined transport and therefore contained only in this Protocol shall be preceded by the letter “C".

### Annex  III  

*Technical and operational minimum requirements of European Inland Waterways of importance for International Combined Transport*  

a)  *Technical characteristics of C-E waterways*  The main technical characteristics of C-E waterways shall generally be in conformity with the classification of European inland waterways set out in *Table 1*. For the evaluation of different C-E waterways, the characteristics of classes Vb-VII are to be used, taking account of the following principles: 

(i) The class of a waterway shall be determined by the horizontal dimensions of motor vessels, barges and pushed convoys, and primarily by the main standardized dimension, namely their beam or width;  

(ii) The values for Class Vb in *Table 1* are to be regarded as important minimum objectives to be reached within the framework of relevant infrastructure development programmes. For new inland waterways to be utilized for combined transport a minimum draught of 280 cm should be ensured;  

(iii) The following minimum requirements are considered necessary in order to make a waterway suitable for container transport: inland navigation vessels with a width of 11.4 m and a length of approximately 110 m must be able to operate with three or more layers of containers; otherwise a permissible length of pushed convoys of 185 m should be ensured, in which case they could operate with two layers of containers;  

(iv) When modernizing existing waterways and/or building new ones, vessels and convoys of greater dimensions should always be taken into account;  

(v) In order to ensure more efficient container transport, the highest possible bridge clearance value should be ensured in accordance with footnote 4 of Table 1 ; <sup> 1)  If, however, the proportion of empty containers exceeds 50%, observance of a value for the minimum height under bridges which is higher than that indicated in footnote to *Table 1* should be considered.  </sup>  

(vi) On waterways with fluctuating water levels, the value of the recommended draught should correspond to the draught reached or exceeded for 240 days on average per year (or for 60% of the navigation period). The value of the recommended height under bridges (5.25, 7.00 or 9.10 m) should be ensured over the highest navigation level, where possible and economically reasonable;  

(vii) A uniform class, draught and height under bridges should be ensured either for the whole waterway or at least for substantial sections thereof;  

(viii) Where possible, the parameters of adjacent inland waterways should be the same or similar;  

(ix) The highest draught (4.50 m) and minimum bridge clearance (9.10 m) values should be ensured on all parts of the network that are directly connected with coastal routes;  

(x) A minimum bridge clearance of 7.00 m should be ensured on waterways that connect important sea ports with the hinterland and are suitable for efficient container and river-sea traffic;  

(xi) Coastal routes listed in *Annex I* above are intended to ensure the integrity of the C-E waterways' network throughout Europe and are meant to be used, within the meaning of this Protocol, by river-sea vessels whose dimensions should, where possible and economically viable, meet the requirements for selfpropelled units suitable for navigating on inland waterways of classes Vb and above.       ![10000012006](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000012006)
Footnotes to Table 1 

1 The first figure takes into account the existing situations, whereas the second one represents both future developments and, in some cases, existing situations.  

2 Allows for a safety clearance of about 0.30 m between the uppermost point of the vessel's structure or its load and a bridge.  

3 Allows for expected future developments in ro-ro, container and river-sea navigation.  

4 Checked for container transport: 5.25 m for vessels transporting 2 layers of containers; 7.00 m for vessels transporting 3 layers of containers: 9.10 m for vessels transporting 4 layers of containers. 50% of the containers may be empty or ballast should be used.  

5 The draught value for a particular inland waterway to be determined according to the local conditions.  

6 Convoys consisting of a larger number of barges can also be used on some sections of waterways of class VII. In this case, the horizontal dimensions may exceed the values shown in the table.   

b)  *Operational minimum requirements for C-E waterways*  C-E waterways should meet the following essential operational criteria in order to be able to ensure reliable international traffic: 

(i) Through traffic should be ensured throughout the navigation period, with the exception of the breaks mentioned below;  

(ii) The navigation period may be shorter than 365 days only in regions with severe climatic conditions, where the maintaining of channels free of ice in the winter season is not possible and a winter break is therefore necessary. In these cases, dates should be fixed for the opening and closure of navigation. The duration of breaks in the navigation period caused by natural phenomena such as ice, floods, etc. should be kept to a minimum by appropriate technical and organizational measures;  

(iii) The duration of breaks in the navigation period for regular maintenance of locks and other hydraulic works should be kept to a minimum. Users of a waterway where maintenance work is planned should be kept informed of the dates and duration of the envisaged break in navigation. In cases of unforeseen failure of locks or other hydraulic facilities, or other *force majeure*, the duration of breaks should be kept as limited as possible using all appropriate measures to remedy the situation;  

(iv) No breaks shall be admissible during low water periods. A reasonable limitation of admissible draught may nevertheless be allowed on waterways with fluctuating water levels. However, a minimum draught of 1.20 m should be ensured at all times, with the recommended or characteristic draught being ensured or exceeded for 240 days per year. In regions referred to in subparagraph (ii) above, the minimum draught of 1.20 m should be ensured for 60% of the navigation period on average;  

(v) Operating hours of locks, movable bridges and other infrastructure works shall be such that round-the-clock (24-hour) navigation can be ensured on working days, if economically feasible. In specific cases, exceptions may be allowed due to organizational and/or technical reasons. Reasonable hours of navigation should also be ensured during holidays and at weekends.    

c)  *Technical and operational minimum requirements for terminals in ports*  The network of C-E waterways shall be complemented by a system of terminals in inland waterway ports. Each terminal shall meet the following technical and operational minimum requirements: 

(i) It should be situated on a C-E waterway;  

(ii) It should be capable of accommodating vessels or pushed convoys used on the relevant C-E waterway in conformity with its class;  

(iii) It should be connected with main roads and railway lines (preferably belonging to the network of international roads and railway lines established by the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR), the European Agreement on Main International Railway Lines (AGC) and the European Agreement on Important International Combined Transport Lines and Related Installations (AGTC));  

(iv) Its aggregate cargo handling capacity should be in the order of 30,000 to 40,000 TEUs a year;  

(v) It should offer suitable conditions for the development of a port industrial zone;  

(vi) All the facilities necessary for usual operations in international traffic should be available;  

(vii) With a view to ensuring the protection of the environment, reception facilities for the disposal of waste generated on board ships should be available in ports of international importance;  

(viii) Efficient transshipment of containers and other intermodal transport units (swap-bodies, semi-trailers, goods road vehicles, etc.) should be ensured and sufficient capacity for the intermediate storage of containers and suitable equipment for container handling should be available;  

(ix) Regular container handling should be made economical with specific and tailor-made terminals for combined transport;  

(x) Apart from the actual transshipment of containers (mainly with container cranes having a capacity of 15 to 20 units per hour), a large number of other services should be offered by these terminals. These services could include the organization of the onward transport of containers, the storage of empty units as well as maintenance and repair of damaged containers;  

(xi) For ro-ro services special facilities should be available, such as loading ramps, special berths and parking areas;  

(xii) Berths for inland water vessels used in combined transport should provide for a guaranteed draught of at least 2.80 m and desirably 3.5 m, a length suitable to accommodate vessels with a length of at least 110 m and a bridge clearance equal to that of the adjoining waterways;  

(xiii) Efficient handling of consignments in the terminals can substantially contribute to achieving efficient international combined transport services, especially if the following requirements are met: The period from the latest time of acceptance of goods to the departure of vessels and from the arrival of vessels to the beginning of unloading of containers should not exceed one hour, unless the wishes of customers regarding the latest time of acceptance or disposal of goods can be complied with by other means; The waiting periods for road vehicles delivering or collecting loading units should be as short as possible (20 minutes maximum); These requirements can be met through appropriate arrangement and dimensioning of the various elements of the transshipment terminal (see (viii));  

(xiv) The individual functional areas of a terminal are again composed of a number of system components. In order to obtain a transshipment terminal which is optimal in all respects, it is necessary to provide well-balanced dimensions for the individual system components, since the efficiency of the terminal is determined by its weakest component.

### Bijlage  I  

####Belangrijke binnenwateren voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer

Nummering van binnenwateren van internationaal belang  

<sup> *)  Binnenwateren worden van belang geacht voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer, indien zij thans worden gebruikt voor regelmatig internationaal gecombineerd vervoer, indien zij als belangrijke aanvoerlijnen voor internationaal vervoer fungeren of indien wordt verwacht dat zij in de nabije toekomst belangrijk worden voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer (zie artikel 1, onder b).  </sup>  

### 1  

Alle belangrijke binnenwateren voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer, hebben twee-, vier-, of zes-cijferige nummers, voorafgegaan door de letters „C-E" . <sup> **)  C-E-binnenwateren zijn opgenomen in het Europees Verdrag inzake de binnenlandse hoofdwaterwegen van internationaal belang (AGN) en in dit Protocol.  </sup>  

### 2  

Elementaire hoofdgedeelten van het net van C-E-waterwegen worden aangeduid met tweecijferige nummers en hun zijrivieren en aftakkingen daarvan („zijrivieren van zijrivieren") respectievelijk met vier- en zescijferige nummers.  

### 3  

Hoofdvaarroutes die voornamelijk in noord-zuidrichting lopen, toegang geven tot zeehavens en het ene zeebekken met het andere verbinden, krijgen de nummers 10, 20, 30, 40 en 50, oplopend van west naar oost.  

### 4  

Hoofdvaarroutes die voornamelijk in west-oostrichting lopen en die drie of meer in punt 3 hierboven vermelde binnenwateren kruisen, krijgen de nummers 60, 70, 80 en 90, in oplopende volgorde van noord naar zuid.  

### 5  

Andere binnenlandse hoofdvaarwegen worden aangegeven met tweecijferige nummers tussen de nummers van de beide hoofdvaarroutes, vermeld in 3 en 4 hierboven, waartussen zij zich bevinden.  

### 6  

In het geval van zijrivieren (of zijrivieren van zijrivieren) duiden de eerste twee (of vier) cijfers het desbetreffende belangrijkste deel van het waterwegennet aan en de laatste twee op het nummer van de zijrivier in kwestie, genummerd in volgorde van het begin tot het eind van het belangrijkste deel, zoals beschreven in onderstaande tabel. Even nummers worden gebruikt voor rechter zijrivieren en oneven nummers voor linker zijrivieren.

### Bijlage  II  

####Terminals in belangrijke havens voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer

<sup> ***)  Terminals worden geacht van belang te zijn voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer, indien zij tezamen met de respectieve binnenwateren en kustroutes een samenhangend net voor gecombineerd vervoer vormen en indien zij reeds voor gecombineerd vervoer worden gebruikt.  </sup>   
### *Nummering van terminals in binnenhavens* 

Alle terminals in belangrijke binnenhavens voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer dragen een nummer bestaande uit het nummer van het vaarwater waaraan zij liggen, gevolgd door een liggend streepje, gevolgd door twee cijfers, die corresponderen met een haven aan een specifiek vaarwater, genummerd van west naar oost en van noord naar zuid. De terminals in binnenhavens die zijn opgenomen in het Europees Verdrag inzake de binnenlandse hoofdwaterwegen van internationaal belang (AGN) en in dit Protocol worden voorafgegaan door de letters „C-P"; de terminals die uitsluitend van belang zijn voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer en daarom alleen in dit Protocol zijn opgenomen, worden voorafgegaan door de letter „C".

####Technische en operationele minimumeisen voor belangrijke Europese binnenwateren voor internationaal gecombineerd vervoer

a.  *Technische kenmerken van C-E-wateren*  De belangrijkste technische kenmerken van C-E-wateren komen doorgaans overeen met de in *Tabel 1* opgenomen classificatie van Europese binnenwateren. Voor de beoordeling van de verschillende C-E-wateren dienen de kenmerken van de categorieën Vb-VII te worden gehanteerd, met inachtneming van de volgende beginselen: 

i. De categorie vaarverbinding wordt bepaald door de horizontale afmetingen van motorvaartuigen, duwbakken en duwstellen en wel primair op basis van de belangrijkste standaardafmeting: de grootste breedte;  

ii. De waarden voor categorie Vb in *Tabel 1* dienen als belangrijke minimumdoelstellingen te worden beschouwd, waaraan in het kader van relevante programma's voor de ontwikkeling van infrastructuur dient te worden voldaan. Voor nieuwe binnenwateren die dienst gaan doen voor gecombineerd vervoer dient een minimale diepgang van 280 cm te worden verzekerd;  

iii. Wil een vaarverbinding zich lenen voor containervervoer, dan dient deze aan de volgende minimumeisen te voldoen: binnenvaartschepen met een breedte van 11,4 m en een lengte van ongeveer 110 m moeten met drie lagen containers of meer kunnen varen; anders moet worden gezorgd dat een duwstellengte van 185 m is toegestaan, in welk geval deze vaartuigen met twee lagen containers zouden kunnen varen;  

iv. Bij het moderniseren van bestaande wateren en/of het aanleggen van nieuwe dient steeds rekening te worden gehouden met vaartuigen en duwstellen van grotere afmetingen;  

v. Om doelmatiger containervervoer te waarborgen, dient te worden gezorgd voor een zo groot mogelijke doorvaarthoogte, in overeenstemming met voetnoot 4 van Tabel 1 ; <sup> 3)  Indien het percentage lege containers echter meer dan 50% bedraagt, zou een ruimere minimumdoorvaarhoogte onder bruggen dan vermeld in voetnoot 4 van *Tabel 1* moeten worden overwogen.  </sup>  

vi. Op wateren met een veranderlijk waterpeil moet de waarde van de aanbevolen diepgang overeenkomen met die welke gemiddeld 240 dagen per jaar (of 60% van de navigatieperiode) wordt bereikt of overtroffen. De waarde van de aanbevolen doorvaarhoogte onder bruggen (5,25, 7,00 of 9,10 m) moet, voor zover dat mogelijk en economisch haalbaar is, voor het hoogste vaarpeil worden gegarandeerd;  

vii. Voor de hele vaarverbinding of althans aanzienlijke gedeelten hiervan dienen een uniforme categorie, diepgang of doorvaarhoogte onder bruggen te worden gewaarborgd;  

viii. Waar mogelijk moeten de parameters van aangrenzende binnenwateren hetzelfde of vergelijkbaar zijn;  

ix. De grootste diepgang (4,50 m) en de grootste minimumdoorvaarhoogte onder bruggen (9,10 m) moeten op alle delen van het net die rechtstreeks in verbinding staan met kustroutes worden verzekerd;  

x. Een minimumdoorvaarhoogte van 7 m moet worden gewaarborgd op vaarwegen die belangrijke zeehavens verbinden met het achterland en die geschikt zijn voor doelmatig containervervoer en verkeer van de rivier naar zee en andersom;  

xi. De in *Bijlage 1* vermelde kustroutes beogen de continuïteit van het net van C-E-vaarwegen in heel Europa te verzekeren en zijn bestemd om te worden gebruikt, in de zin van dit Protocol, door kruiplijncoasters, waarvan de afmetingen, voor zover mogelijk en economisch haalbaar, voldoen aan de vereisten voor vaartuigen met eigen aandrijving die geschikt zijn voor het bevaren van binnenwateren van de categorieën Vb en hoger.   ![10000012006](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000012006)
Voetnoten bij tabel 1 

1) Het eerste cijfer correspondeert met de bestaande situaties, terwijl het tweede zowel de toekomstige ontwikkelingen, als, in sommige gevallen, de bestaande situaties weergeeft.  

2) Laat een veiligheidsmarge van ongeveer 0,30 m tussen het hoogste punt van de opbouw of de lading van het vaartuig en een brug.  

3) Houdt rekening met de verwachte toekomstige ontwikkelingen in ro-ro-, container- en kustvaart.  

4) Geverifieerde hoogte voor containervervoer: 5,25 voor vaartuigen die 2 lagen containers vervoeren; 7,00 m voor vaartuigen die drie lagen containers vervoeren; 9,10 voor vaartuigen die 4 lagen containers vervoeren. 50% van de containers mag leeg zijn; boven dit percentage moet ballast worden gebruikt.  

5) De diepgangswaarde voor een bepaald binnenwater, vast te stellen in overeenstemming met de lokale omstandigheden.  

6) Op sommige delen van wateren van categorie VII kunnen ook duwstellen bestaande uit een groter aantal duwbakken varen. In dit geval mogen de horizontale afmetingen groter zijn dan de in deze tabel vermelde waarden.      

b.  *Operationele minimumeisen voor C-E-wateren*  C-E-wateren moeten voldoen aan de volgende essentiële operationele criteria om betrouwbaar internationaal vervoer te kunnen waarborgen: 

i. Gedurende de gehele navigatieperiode, met uitzondering van de hieronder vermelde onderbrekingen, moet het scheepvaartverkeer worden gewaarborgd;  

ii. De navigatieperiode mag alleen korter zijn dan 365 dagen in gebieden met een streng klimaat, waar het in de wintertijd niet mogelijk is een vaargeul ijsvrij te houden en onderbreking van de scheepvaart in de winter dus noodzakelijk is. In deze gevallen moeten data worden vastgesteld voor openstelling en sluiting van de scheepvaart. De duur van de onderbrekingen van de navigatieperiode als gevolg van natuurverschijnselen als bevriezing, overstromingen, enzovoorts, dient met behulp van adequate technische en organisatorische maatregelen tot een minimum te worden beperkt;  

iii. De duur van onderbrekingen van de navigatieperiode wegens regelmatig onderhoud van sluizen en andere hydraulische voorzieningen dient tot een minimum te worden beperkt. De gebruikers van wateren waar onderhoudswerkzaamheden op het programma staan, moeten op de hoogte worden gehouden van de data en de duur van de beoogde onderbreking van de scheepvaart. Wanneer sluizen of andere hydraulische voorzieningen onverwacht gebreken vertonen of in andere gevallen van overmacht, moet de duur van de onderbrekingen met behulp van alle geëigende middelen om de problemen te verhelpen, zo veel mogelijk worden beperkt.  

iv. Gedurende periodes van laagwater zijn onderbrekingen niet toegestaan. Op wateren met een veranderend waterpeil kunnen echter redelijke beperkingen van toelaatbare diepgang worden toegestaan. Er dient echter te allen tijde een minimumdiepgang van 1,20 m te worden gewaarborgd en de aanbevolen of gebruikelijke diepgang moet 240 dagen per jaar worden gewaarborgd of overtroffen. In de in punt ii hierboven bedoelde gebieden moet gemiddeld gedurende 60% van de navigatieperiode een minimumdiepgang van 1,20 m worden gewaarborgd.  

v. Bedieningstijden van sluizen, beweegbare bruggen en andere infrastructurele werken dienen zodanig te zijn dat op werkdagen 24 uur per dag kan worden gevaren, indien dit economisch haalbaar is. In specifieke gevallen kunnen om organisatorische en/of technische redenen uitzonderingen worden toegestaan. Tijdens feestdagen en weekends dienen tevens redelijke vaaruren te worden gewaarborgd.    

c.  *Technische en operationele minimumeisen voor terminals in havens.*  Het net van C-E-wateren dient te worden aangevuld met een stelsel van terminals in binnenhavens. Elke terminal dient aan de volgende technische en operationele minimumeisen te voldoen: 

i. Hij moet aan een C-E water zijn gelegen;  

ii. Hij moet geschikt zijn voor vaartuigen of duwstellen die op de desbetreffende C-E-wateren overeenkomstig de categorie daarvan worden gebruikt;  

iii. Hij moet in verbinding staan met de hoofdwegen en -spoorlijnen (die bij voorkeur behoren tot het door de Europese Overeenkomst inzake internationale hoofdverkeerswegen (AGR), de Europese Overeenkomst inzake belangrijke internationale spoorwegen (AGC) en de Europese Overeenkomst inzake belangrijke lijnen voor het internationaal gecombineerd vervoer en daarmee samenhangende installaties (AGTC) tot stand gebrachte internationale wegen- en spoorwegennet;  

iv. De gecombineerde vrachtafhandelingscapaciteit moet liggen in de orde van grootte van 30.000 tot 40.000 TEU per jaar;  

v. Hij moet passende voorwaarden bieden om een bedrijventerrein in een havengebied te ontwikkelen;  

vi. Alle voor de gebruikelijke activiteiten in het internationale vervoer benodigde voorzieningen dienen beschikbaar te zijn;  

vii. Ten einde het milieu te beschermen, dienen in internationaal belangrijke havens voorzieningen aanwezig te zijn voor het in ontvangst nemen van aan boord van schepen gegenereerd afval;  

viii. Er dienen voorzieningen aanwezig te zijn om containers en andere intermodale vervoerseenheden (wissellaadbakken, opleggers, vrachtwagens, enz.) doelmatig over te slaan, er moet voldoende capaciteit aanwezig zijn voor tijdelijke opslag van containers en er moeten passende voorzieningen zijn om containers af te handelen;  

ix. Regelmatige afhandeling van containers moet met specifieke terminals op maat voor gecombineerd vervoer renderend worden gemaakt;  

x. Afgezien van de feitelijke overslag van containers (hoofdzakelijk met containerkranen met een capaciteit van 15 tot 20 eenheden per uur), moeten deze terminals een groot aantal andere diensten aanbieden. Dit zouden diensten kunnen zijn op het gebied van de organisatie van doorvoer van containers, de opslag van lege eenheden/containers, alsmede onderhoud en reparatie van beschadigde containers;  

xi. Voor ro-ro-diensten moeten bijzondere voorzieningen beschikbaar zijn, zoals laadplatforms, speciale aanlegplaatsen en parkeerruimten;  

xii. Bij aanlegplaatsen voor binnenvaartschepen die worden gebruikt bij gecombineerd vervoer moet de diepgang gegarandeerd ten minste 2,80 m bedragen en bij voorkeur 3,5 m, zij moeten zijn berekend op schepen van ten minste 110 m lengte en de doorvaarhoogte onder bruggen moet gelijk zijn aan die van de aangrenzende wateren;  

xiii. Doelmatige afhandeling van ladingen in de terminals kan in aanzienlijke mate bijdragen aan de totstandbrenging van doelmatige internationale gecombineerde vervoersdiensten, met name indien aan de volgende vereisten wordt voldaan: Het tijdvak tussen het laatste tijdstip van aanvaarding van goederen en het vertrek van vaartuigen en vanaf de aankomst van vaartuigen tot de aanvang van het lossen van containers mag niet langer zijn dan één uur, tenzij op andere wijze kan worden voldaan aan de wensen van afnemers met betrekking tot het uiterste tijdstip van aanvaarding of het lossen van goederen; De wachttijden voor vrachtwagens die laadeenheden afleveren of ophalen moeten zo kort mogelijk zijn (maximaal 20 minuten); Aan deze eisen kan worden voldaan met behulp van passende voorzieningen en door het hanteren van de juiste afmetingen van de verschillende elementen van de overslagterminal (zie viii);  

xiv. De individuele werkruimten van een terminal bestaan weer uit een aantal systeemonderdelen. Om te komen tot een in alle opzichten optimale overslagterminal, dienen de individuele systeemonderdelen qua afmetingen goed met elkaar in evenwicht te zijn, want de doelmatigheid van de terminal wordt bepaald door zijn zwakste onderdeel.
