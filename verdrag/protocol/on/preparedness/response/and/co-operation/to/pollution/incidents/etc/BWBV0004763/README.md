### Annex  

####Reimbursement of Costs of Assistance

### 1  

a) Unless an agreement concerning the financial arrangements governing actions of Parties to deal with pollution incidents has been concluded on a bilateral or multilateral basis prior to the pollution incident, Parties shall bear the costs of their respective actions in dealing with pollution in accordance with subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (ii). 

(i) If the action was taken by one Party at the express request of another Party, the requesting Party shall reimburse to the assisting Party the costs of its action. The requesting Party may cancel its request at any time, but in that case it shall bear the costs already incurred or committed by the assisting Party.  

(ii) If the action was taken by a Party on its own initiative, this Party shall bear the costs of its action.    

b) The principles laid down in subparagraph a) shall apply unless the Parties concerned otherwise agree in any individual case.    

### 2  

Unless otherwise agreed, the costs of action taken by a Party at the request of another Party shall be fairly calculated according to the law and current practice of the assisting Party concerning the reimbursement of such costs.  

### 3  

The Party requesting assistance and the assisting Party shall, where appropriate, co-operate in concluding any action in response to a compensation claim. To that end, they shall give due consideration to existing legal regimes. Where the action thus concluded does not permit full compensation for expenses incurred in the assistance operation, the Party requesting assistance may ask the assisting Party to waive reimbursement of the expenses exceeding the sums compensated or to reduce the costs which have been calculated in accordance with paragraph 2. It may also request a postponement of the reimbursement of such costs. In considering such a request, assisting Parties shall give due consideration to the needs of the developing countries.  

### 4  

The provisions of this Protocol shall not be interpreted as in any way prejudicing the rights of Parties to recover from third parties the costs of actions to deal with pollution or the threat of pollution under other applicable provisions and rules of national and international law.

### Artikel  1  

####Algemene bepalingen

1.  De Partijen verplichten zich, afzonderlijk of gezamenlijk, alle passende maatregelen te nemen, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Protocol en de Bijlage daarbij, ter voorbereiding op en ter bestrijding van een voorval van verontreiniging door gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen.   
2.  De Bijlage bij dit Protocol maakt een integrerend deel uit van dit Protocol en een verwijzing naar dit Protocol vormt tegelijkertijd een verwijzing naar de Bijlage.   
3.  Dit Protocol is niet van toepassing op oorlogsschepen, marinehulpschepen of andere schepen in eigendom van of in beheer bij een Staat, die tijdelijk uitsluitend worden ingezet voor niet-commerciële overheidsdienst. Elke Partij waarborgt evenwel, door het nemen van passende maatregelen die de werkzaamheden of de operationele kwaliteiten van dergelijke schepen in haar eigendom of beheer niet aantasten, dat dergelijke schepen, voor zover redelijk en uitvoerbaar, opereren in overeenstemming met dit Protocol.   

### Artikel  2

Voor de toepassing van dit Protocol: 

1. wordt onder voorval van verontreiniging door gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen (hierna genoemd: voorval van verontreiniging) verstaan: elke gebeurtenis of opeenvolging van gebeurtenissen met dezelfde oorzaak, met inbegrip van vuur of ontploffing, die leidt of kan leiden tot het lozen, vrijkomen of uitstoten van schadelijke en gevaarlijke stoffen en die een bedreiging vormt of kan vormen voor het mariene milieu, of voor de kust of daarmee samenhangende belangen van één of meer Staten en die noodmaatregelen of onmiddellijk optreden vergt.  

2. wordt onder gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen verstaan: elke stof anders dan olie die, indien in het mariene milieu gebracht, waarschijnlijk gevaar oplevert voor de gezondheid van de mens, de levende rijkdommen en het mariene leven schaadt, afbreuk doet aan de leefbaarheid of ander rechtmatig gebruik van de zee belemmert.  

3. wordt onder zeehavens en inrichtingen voor de overslag van gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen verstaan: havens of voorzieningen waar zulke stoffen worden geladen in of gelost uit schepen.  

4. wordt onder Organisatie verstaan: de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie.  

5. wordt onder Secretaris-Generaal verstaan: de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie.

Zowel de vereisten voor rampenplannen als de meldingsprocedures dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met de toepasselijke bepalingen van de binnen de Organisatie ontwikkelde verdragen die voor die Partij in werking zijn getreden. Rampenplannen voor voorvallen van verontreiniging aan boord voor offshore-installaties, met inbegrip van drijvende inrichtingen voor productie, opslag en lossen en drijvende inrichtingen voor opslag, moeten worden geregeld door nationale bepalingen en/of bedrijfsinterne milieuzorgsystemen, en zijn uitgezonderd van de toepassing van dit artikel.   
2.  Elke Partij verlangt dat de autoriteiten of exploitanten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor onder haar rechtsmacht vallende zeehavens en inrichtingen voor de overslag van gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen waarvan zij meent dat deze daarvoor in aanmerking komen, beschikken over rampenplannen of soortgelijke regelingen voor voorvallen van verontreiniging door gevaarlijke en schadelijke stoffen waarvan zij meent dat deze daarvoor in aanmerking komen, die zijn afgestemd op het in overeenstemming met artikel 4 ingestelde nationale systeem en goedgekeurd in overeenstemming met door de bevoegde nationale autoriteit vastgestelde procedures.   
3.  Wanneer de desbetreffende autoriteiten van een Partij kennis nemen van een voorval van verontreiniging, doen zij hiervan mededeling aan andere Staten waarvan de belangen waarschijnlijk door dat voorval worden aangetast.   

### Artikel  4  

####Nationale en regionale systemen voor voorbereiding en bestrijding

### Bijlage  

####Vergoeding van kosten van bijstand

### 1  

a. Tenzij voorafgaand aan het voorval van verontreiniging een bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomst is gesloten inzake de financiële regelingen aangaande het optreden van Partijen ter bestrijding van voorvallen van verontreiniging, dragen de Partijen de kosten van hun onderscheiden optreden bij de bestrijding van verontreiniging in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in punt i of punt ii. 

i. Indien het optreden door een Partij op uitdrukkelijk verzoek van een andere Partij geschiedde, vergoedt de verzoekende Partij de hulpverlenende Partij de kosten van haar optreden. De verzoekende Partij kan haar verzoek te allen tijde intrekken, maar dient in dat geval de kosten te dragen die reeds zijn gemaakt door de hulpverlenende Partij, of waartoe deze zich reeds heeft verbonden.  

ii. Indien het optreden door een Partij uit eigen beweging geschiedde, draagt die Partij de kosten van haar optreden.    

b. Tenzij de betrokken Partijen in een afzonderlijk geval anders zijn overeengekomen, zijn de in letter a vervatte beginselen van toepassing.    

### 2  

Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, worden de kosten van optreden door een Partij op verzoek van een andere Partij op billijke wijze berekend overeenkomstig het recht en de geldende praktijk van de hulpverlenende Partij, betreffende de vergoeding van dergelijke kosten.  

### 3  

De Partij die om hulp verzoekt en de hulpverlenende Partij werken, indien van toepassing, samen bij de afhandeling van een vordering naar aanleiding van een aanspraak op vergoeding. Daartoe schenken zij de nodige aandacht aan bestaande rechtsregimes. Wanneer de aldus afgehandelde vordering niet leidt tot volledige vergoeding van de met de hulp gemoeide uitgaven, kan de Partij die om de hulp verzoekt de hulpverlenende Partij vragen af te zien van aanspraak op terugbetaling van uitgaven die de vergoeding overstijgen, of vragen om verlaging van de in overeenstemming met het tweede lid berekende kosten. Zij kan ook verzoeken om uitstel van vergoeding van bedoelde kosten. Bij de behandeling van een dergelijk verzoek schenkt de hulpverlenende Partij de nodige aandacht aan de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden.  

### 4  

De bepalingen van dit Protocol mogen niet zodanig worden geïnterpreteerd dat daardoor afbreuk wordt gedaan aan de rechten van Partijen betreffende het op derden verhalen van de kosten van maatregelen naar aanleiding van verontreiniging of de dreiging van verontreiniging, zulks uit hoofde van andere toepasselijke bepalingen en regels van nationaal en internationaal recht.
