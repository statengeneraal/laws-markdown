In afwachting van de voltooiing van die stapsgewijze afschaffing wordt, wanneer het nodig is zich te ontdoen van afval door verbranding in de open lucht, rekening gehouden met de windrichting, de windkracht en het soort afval dat wordt verbrand om afzetting van deeltjes te beperken en te vermijden dat deze worden afgezet in gebieden van bijzondere biologische, wetenschappelijke, historische of esthetische betekenis of van betekenis als wildernis, met inbegrip van, met name, de gebieden die bescherming genieten uit hoofde van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica.   

### Artikel  4  

####Andere wijzen van verwijderen van afval op land

1.  Afval dat niet is afgevoerd, of gestort of verbrand overeenkomstig de artikelen 2 en 3 wordt niet verwijderd in ijsvrije gebieden of in zoetwatersystemen.   
2.  Sanitair afval, vloeibaar huishoudelijk afval alsmede ander vloeibaar afval dat niet is afgevoerd uit het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is, wordt zo min mogelijk verwijderd op zeeijs, ijsplaten of de ijskap, met dien verstande dat afval ontstaan in landinwaarts op ijsplaten of op de ijskap gelegen stations mag worden gestort in diepe ijsputten, waar een dergelijke storting de enig uitvoerbare methode is. Dergelijke putten worden niet aangelegd op bekende stroomlijnen in ijs die eindigen bij ijsvrije gebieden of in gebieden met een hoge afsmelting.   
3.  Afval ontstaan in bivakken wordt zoveel mogelijk door de veroorzaker van dat afval afgevoerd naar ondersteunende stations of schepen om te worden verwijderd overeenkomstig deze Bijlage.   

### Artikel  5  

####Het lozen van afval in zee

1.  Sanitair afval alsmede vloeibaar huisafval kan direct in zee worden geloosd, daarbij rekening houdend met het assimilatievermogen van het ontvangende mariene milieu en op voorwaarde dat: 

a. de lozing geschiedt, indien uitvoerbaar, op een plaats waar voorwaarden aanwezig zijn voor een onmiddellijke verdunning en een snelle verspreiding; en  

b. grote hoeveelheden afval (ontstaan in stations waar de gemiddelde wekelijkse bezetting in de australe zomer uit ongeveer 30 personen of meer bestaat) ten minste een maceratiebewerking heeft ondergaan.     
2.  Het bijprodukt dat ontstaat bij de behandeling van sanitair afval met behulp van een roterende biologische waterzuiveringstrommel of met soortgelijke procédés kan worden verwijderd in zee mits die verwijdering geen nadelige invloed heeft op het plaatselijke milieu en mits die verwijdering in zee tevens in overeenstemming is met Bijlage IV bij het Protocol.   

### Artikel  6  

####Opslag van afval

Al het afval dat dient te worden afgevoerd uit het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is, dan wel anderszins dient te worden verwijderd, wordt zodanig tijdelijk opgeslagen dat verspreiding daarvan in het milieu wordt voorkomen.  

### Artikel  7  

####Verboden produkten

Er worden geen polychloorbifenylen (PCB's), niet-steriele aarde, polystyrene bolletjes, chips of soortgelijke vormen van verpakking, of pesticiden (anders dan vereist voor wetenschappelijke, medische of hygiënische doeleinden) binnengebracht op het land of ijsplaten of in het water in het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is.  

### Artikel  8  

####Afvalbeheersplanning

1.  Elke Partij die zelfactiviteiten uitvoert in het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is, stelt ten aanzien van die activiteiten een classificatiesysteem voor het verwijderen van afval op als basis voor de registratie van afval en ten einde onderzoek te vergemakkelijken ter evaluatie van de milieu-effecten van wetenschappelijke activiteiten en daarmee samenhangende logistieke ondersteuning. Hiertoe wordt geproduceerd afval geclassificeerd als: 

a. sanitair afval en vloeibaar huishoudelijk afval (Groep 1);  

b. ander vloeibaar afval en chemicaliën, met inbegrip van brandstoffen en smeermiddelen (Groep 2);  

c. te verbranden vaste stoffen (Groep 3);  

d. ander vast afval (Groep 4); en  

e. radioactief materiaal (Groep 5).     
2.  Ten einde het effect van afval op het Antarctische milieu verder te beperken, stelt elke Partij afvalbeheersplannen op die zij jaarlijks toetst en bijstelt (met inbegrip van afvalbeperking, opslag en verwijdering), en waarin voor elke vaste plaats, voor bivakken in het algemeen en voor elk schip (anders dan kleine boten die onderdeel zijn van de bedrijfsvoering van vaste plaatsen of van schepen en rekening houdend met bestaande beheersplannen voor schepen) het volgende wordt vermeld: 

a. programma's voor het schoonmaken van bestaande afvalstorten verbrandingsplaatsen en verlaten werkplaatsen;  

b. van kracht zijnde en geplande afvalbeheersregelingen, met inbegrip van definitieve verwijdering;  

c. van kracht zijnde en geplande regelingen om de gevolgen van afval en afvalbeheer voor het milieu te analyseren; en  

d. andere pogingen om de gevolgen van afval en afvalbeheer voor het milieu tot een minimum te beperken.     
3.  Elke Partij stelt voor zover mogelijk een inventaris op van locaties waar in het verleden activiteiten hebben plaatsgevonden (zoals overslagplaatsen, brandstofdepots, veldbases, neergestorte vliegtuigen) voordat de informatie verloren is gegaan, zodat met die locaties rekening kan worden gehouden bij het in de toekomst plannen van wetenschappelijke programma's (zoals chemisch onderzoek van het ijs, milieuvervuilende stoffen in korstmossen of het boren naar ijskernen).   

### Artikel  9  

####Toezending en toetsing van afvalbeheersplannen

1.  De overeenkomstig artikel 8 opgestelde afvalbeheersplannen, rapporten over de uitvoering hiervan en de inventarissen bedoeld in artikel 8, derde lid, maken onderdeel uit van de jaarlijkse informatieuitwisselingen overeenkomstig de artikelen III en VII van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica en daarmee verband houdende Aanbevelingen krachtens artikel IX van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica.   
2.  Elke Partij zendt afschriften van haar afvalbeheersplannen en rapporten inzake de uitvoering en toetsing hiervan, aan de Commissie.   
3.  De Commissie kan afvalbeheersplannen en rapporten daarover toetsen en kan commentaren hierop, met inbegrip van suggesties om de effecten tot een minimum te beperken en wijzigingen en verbetering van de plannen, ter bestudering aan de Partijen voorleggen.   
4.  De Partijen kunnen informatie uitwisselen en advies verstrekken over, onder andere, ter beschikking staande schone technologieën, aanpassing van bestaande installaties, speciale eisen ten aanzien van uitstromende vloeistoffen en passende verwijderings- en loosmethoden.   

### Artikel  10  

####Beheersprocedures in de praktijk

Elke Partij: 

a. wijst een functionaris aan die afvalbeheersplannen ontwikkelt en controleert; ter plekke wordt deze verantwoordelijkheid overgedragen aan een geschikte persoon op elke plaats;  

b. ziet erop toe dat leden van haar expedities training krijgen die erop gericht is om het effect van haar werkzaamheden op het Antarctisch milieu te beperken en hen op de hoogte te stellen van de eisen van deze Bijlage; en  

c. ontmoedigt het gebruik van produkten vervaardigd van polyvinylchloride (PVC) en ziet erop toe dat haar expedities naar het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is ingelicht worden over PVC-produkten die zij eventueel binnenbrengen in het gebied waarop het Verdrag inzake Antarctica van toepassing is, zodat deze produkten vervolgens overeenkomstig deze Bijlage kunnen worden verwijderd.    

### Artikel  11  

####Toetsing

####Aanwijzingsprocedures

1.  Ontwerp-Beheersplannen dienen te worden ingediend bij de Commissie, de Wetenschappelijke Commissie voor Onderzoek op Antarctica en, indien van toepassing, de Commissie voor de Instandhouding van de Levende Rijkdommen in de Antarctische Wateren. Bij het uitbrengen van haar advies aan de Consultatieve Vergadering van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica houdt de Commissie rekening met eventuele opmerkingen van de Wetenschappelijke Commissie voor Onderzoek op Antarctica en, indien van toepassing, de Commissie voor de Instandhouding van de Levende Rijkdommen in de Antarctische Wateren. Daarna kunnen de ontwerp-Beheersplannen worden goedgekeurd door de Consultatieve Partijen bij het Verdrag inzake Antarctica door een maatregel, aangenomen tijdens een Consultatieve Vergadering van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica in overeenstemming met artikel IX, eerste lid, van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica. Tenzij in de maatregel anders is aangegeven, wordt het Beheersplan geacht te zijn goedgekeurd 90 dagen na de sluiting van de Consultatieve Vergadering van het Verdrag inzake Antarctica tijdens welke de maatregel werd aangenomen, tenzij één of meer Consultatieve Partijen binnen dat tijdvak de Depositaris ervan in kennis stellen dat zij een verlenging van die termijn wensen of dat zij de maatregel niet kunnen goedkeuren.   
2.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de artikelen 4 en 5 van het Protocol, wordt geen zeegebied aangewezen als Speciaal Beschermd Antarctisch Gebied of Speciaal Beheerd Antarctisch Gebied zonder de voorafgaande goedkeuring van de Commissie voor de Instandhouding van de Levende Rijkdommen in de Antarctische Wateren.   
3.  De aanwijzing van een Speciaal Beschermd Antarctisch Gebied of een Speciaal Beheerd Antarctisch Gebied geschiedt voor onbepaalde tijd, tenzij in het Beheersplan anders is bepaald. Ten minste eens in de vijf jaar,dient een Beheersplan te worden getoetst. Het dient, zo nodig, te worden bijgewerkt.   
4.  Beheersplannen kunnen worden gewijzigd of ingetrokken in overeenstemming met het eerste lid hierboven.   
5.  Na goedkeuring worden Beheersplannen onverwijld door de Depositaris toegezonden aan alle Partijen. De Depositaris houdt een register bij van alle tot dusver goedgekeurde Beheersplannen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Vergunningen
