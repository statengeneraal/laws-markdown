Any such refusal can be based only on the grounds which would apply, under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in the case of a mark deposited direct with the Office which notifies the refusal. However, protection may not be refused, even partially, by reason only that the applicable legislation would permit registration only in a limited number of classes or for a limited number of goods or services.   
2.  

a) Any Office wishing to exercise such right shall notify its refusal to the International Bureau, together with a statement of all grounds, within the period prescribed by the law applicable to that Office and at the latest, subject to subparagraphs b) and c), before the expiry of one year from the date on which the notification of the extension referred to in paragraph 1 has been sent to that Office by the International Bureau.  

b) Notwithstanding subparagraph a), any Contracting Party may declare that, for international registrations made under this Protocol, the time limit of one year referred to in subparagraph a) is replaced by 18 months.  

c) Such declaration may also specify that, when a refusal of protection may result fom an opposition to the granting of protection, such refusal may be notified by the Office of the said Contracting Party to the International Bureau after the expiry of the 18-month time limit. Such an Office may, with respect to any given international registration, notify a refusal of protection after the expiry of the 18-month time limit, but only if 

(i) it has, before the expiry of the 18-month time limit, informed the International Bureau of the possibility that oppositions may be led after the expiry of the 18-month time limit, and  

(ii) The notification of the refusal based on an opposition is made within a time limit of one month from the expiry of the opposition period and, in any case, not later than seven months from the date on which the opposition period begins.    

d) Any declaration under subparagraphs b) or c) may be made in the instruments referred to in Article 14.2), and the effective date of the declaration shall be the same as the date of entry into force of this Protocol with respect to the State or intergovernmental organization having made the declaration. Any such declaration may also be made later, in which case the declaration shall have effect three months after its receipt by the Director General of the Organization (hereinafter referred to as "the Director General"), or at any later date indicated in the declaration, in respect of any international registration whose date is the same as or is later than the effective date of the declaration.  

e) Upon the expiry of a period of ten years from the entry into force of this Protocol, the Assembly shall examine the operation of the system established by subparagraphs (a) to (d). Thereafter, the provisions of the said subparagraphs may be modified by a unanimous decision of the Assembly . <sup> *  Interpretative statement adopted by the Assembly of the Madrid Union:   ‘‘Article 5(2)(e) of the Protocol is understood as allowing the Assembly to keep under review the operation of the system established by subparagraphs (a) to (d), it being also understood that any modification of those provisions shall require a unanimous decision of the Assembly.’’  </sup>     
3.  The International Bureau shall, without delay, transmit one of the copies of the notification of refusal to the holder of the international registration. The said holder shall have the same remedies as if the mark had been deposited by him direct with the Office which has notified its refusal. Where the International Bureau has received information under paragraph 2c)(i), it shall, without delay, transmit the said information to the holder of the international registration.   
4.  The grounds for refusing a mark shall be communicated by the International Bureau to any interested party who may so request.   
5.  Any Office which has not notified, with respect to a given international registration, any provisional or final refusal to the International Bureau in accordance with paragraphs 1) and 2) shall, with respect to that international registration, lose the benefit of the right provided for in paragraph 1).   
6.  Invalidation, by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party, of the effects, in the territory of that Contracting Party, of an international registration may not be pronounced without the holder of such international registration having, in good time, been afforded the opportunity of defending his rights. Invalidation shall be notified to the International Bureau.   

### Article  5bis  

####Documentary Evidence of Legitimacy of Use of Certain Elements of the Mark

Documentary evidence of the legitimacy of the use of certain elements incorporated in a mark, such as armorial bearings, escutcheons, portraits, honorary distinctions, titles, trade names, names of persons other than the name of the applicant, or other like inscriptions, which might be required by the Offices of the Contracting Parties shall be exempt from any legalization as well as from any certification other than that of the Office of origin.

### Article  8  

####Fees for International Application and Registration

####Protocol bij de Schikking van Madrid betreffende de internationale inschrijving van merken aangenomen te Madrid op 27 juni 1989

### Artikel  1  

####Lidmaatschap van de Unie van Madrid

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Protocol (hierna te noemen „de overeenkomstsluitende Staten”), zelfs wanneer zij geen Partij zijn bij de Schikking van Madrid betreffende de internationale inschrijving van merken, zoals herzien te Stockholm in 1967 en zoals gewijzigd in 1979 (hierna te noemen „de Schikking van Madrid (Stockholm)”), en de organisaties bedoeld in artikel 14, eerste lid, letter b, die Partij zijn bij dit Protocol (hierna te noemen „de overeenkomstsluitende Organisaties”) zijn lid van dezelfde Unie als die waarvan de landen die Partij zijn bij de Schikking van Madrid (Stockholm) lid zijn. Met „overeenkomstsluitende Partijen” worden in dit Protocol telkens zowel overeenkomstsluitende Staten als overeenkomstsluitende Organisaties bedoeld.  

### Artikel  2  

####De verkrijging van bescherming door middel van internationale inschrijving

1.  Wanneer een aanvrage om de inschrijving van een merk is ingediend bij de Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij, of wanneer een merk is ingeschreven in het register van de Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij, kan, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Protocol, de persoon ten name van wie die aanvrage (hierna te noemen „de basisaanvrage”) of die inschrijving (hierna te noemen „de basisinschrijving”) is geschied, bescherming van zijn merk verkrijgen op het grondgebied van de overeenkomstsluitende Partijen door dat merk te doen inschrijven in het register van het Internationale Bureau van de Wereldorganisatie voor de Intellectuele Eigendom (hierna onderscheidenlijk te noemen „de internationale inschrijving”, „het internationale register”, „het Internationale Bureau” en „de Organisatie”), mits, 

(i) ingeval de basisaanvrage is ingediend bij de Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Staat of ingeval de basisinschrijving is verricht door een zodanige Administratie, de persoon ten name van wie die aanvrage of inschrijving is geschied onderdaan is van die overeenkomstsluitende Staat, of zijn woonplaats, dan wel een daadwerkelijke en wezenlijke inrichting van overheid of handel heeft in genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Staat,  

(ii) ingeval de basisaanvrage is ingediend bij de Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Organisatie of ingeval de basisinschrijving is verricht door een zodanige Administratie, de persoon ten name van wie die aanvrage of inschrijving is geschied onderdaan is van een lidstaat van die overeenkomstsluitende Organisatie of zijn woonplaats, dan wel een daadwerkelijke en wezenlijke inrichting van nijverheid of handel heeft op het grondgebied van genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Organisatie.     
2.  De aanvrage om internationale inschrijving (hierna te noemen „de internationale aanvrage”) wordt ingediend bij het Internationale Bureau door tussenkomst van de Administratie waarbij de basisaanvrage was ingediend of waardoor de basisinschrijving was verricht (hierna te noemen „de Administratie van oorsprong”), naargelang het geval.   
3.  Met een „Administratie” of een „Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij” wordt in dit Protocol telkens bedoeld een administratie die namens een overeenkomstsluitende Partij is belast met de inschrijving van merken en met „merken” worden in dit Protocol telkens bedoeld handelsmerken en dienstmerken.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit Protocol wordt verstaan onder „grondgebied van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij”, wanneer de overeenkomstsluitende Partij een Staat is, het grondgebied van die Staat en, wanneer de overeenkomstsluitende Partij een intergouvernementele organisatie is, het grondgebied waarop het oprichtingsverdrag van die intergouvernementele organisatie van toepassing is.   

### Artikel  3  

####Internationale aanvrage

1.  Elke internationale aanvrage uit hoofde van dit Protocol moet worden ingediend op het door het reglement van uitvoering voorgeschreven formulier. De Administratie van oorsprong dient te verklaren dat de bijzonderheden die voorkomen in de internationale aanvrage overeenkomen met de bijzonderheden die op het tijdstip van de verklaring voorkomen in de basisaanvrage of de basisinschrijving, naargelang het geval. Voorts dient genoemde Administratie te vermelden: 

(i) in geval van een basisaanvrage, de datum en het nummer van de aanvrage,  

(ii) in geval van een basisinschrijving, de datum en het nummer van de inschrijving, alsmede de datum en het nummer van de aanvrage waaruit de basisinschrijving is voortgevloeid.   De Administratie van oorsprong dient ook de datum van de internationale aanvrage te vermelden.   
2.  De aanvrager dient opgave te doen van de waren en diensten waarvoor bescherming van het merk wordt gevraagd, alsmede, indien mogelijk, van de klasse of klassen volgens de classificatie vastgesteld bij de Overeenkomst van Nice betreffende de internationale classificatie van waren en diensten voor de inschrijving van merken. Indien de aanvrager deze opgave niet doet, deelt het Internationale Bureau de waren en diensten in in de overeenkomstige klassen van genoemde classificatie. De door de aanvrager opgegeven klasse-indeling is onderworpen aan toezicht door het Internationale Bureau, dat genoemd toezicht uitoefent in overleg met de Administratie van oorsprong. Bij verschil van mening tussen genoemde Administratie en het Internationale Bureau is de mening van het Bureau doorslaggevend.   
3.  Indien de aanvrager de kleur als onderscheidend kenmerk van zijn merk verlangt, is hij gehouden 

(i) ervan melding te maken en bij de internationale aanvrage een verklaring te voegen die de verlangde kleur of combinatie van kleuren aanwijst;  

(ii) bij zijn internationale aanvrage gekleurde exemplaren van bedoeld merk te voegen, die worden gehecht aan de kennisgevingen van inschrijving, uitgaande van het Internationale Bureau; het aantal exemplaren wordt bepaald bij het reglement van uitvoering.     
4.  Het Internationale Bureau schrijft de overeenkomstig artikel 2 gedeponeerde merken onmiddellijk in. De internationale inschrijving dient de datum te dragen waarop de internationale aanvrage werd ontvangen door de Administratie van oorsprong, mits de internationale aanvrage door het Internationale Bureau is ontvangen binnen een termijn van twee maanden te rekenen vanaf die datum. Indien de internationale aanvrage niet binnen die termijn is ontvangen, draagt de internationale inschrijving de datum waarop genoemde internationale aanvrage door het Internationale Bureau werd ontvangen. Het Internationale Bureau geeft onverwijld kennis van de internationale inschrijving aan de betrokken Administraties. In het internationale register ingeschreven merken worden openbaar gemaakt in een door het Internationale Bureau uitgegeven regelmatig verschijnend blad, met gebruikmaking van de bijzonderheden vervat in de internationale aanvrage.   
5.  Met het oog op de openbaarheid die aan in het internationale register ingeschreven merken dient te worden gegeven, ontvangt elke Administratie van het Internationale Bureau een aantal kosteloze exemplaren en een aantal exemplaren tegen verminderde prijs van genoemd blad, onder de voorwaarden vastgesteld door de in artikel 10 genoemde Algemene Vergadering (hierna te noemen „de Algemene Vergadering”). Bedoelde openbaarmaking wordt toereikend beschouwd voor de doeleinden van alle overeenkomstsluitende Partijen en van de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving kan geen andere openbaarmaking worden verlangd.   

### Artikel  3bis  

####Territoriale werking

Slechts op verzoek van de persoon die de internationale aanvrage indient of die rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving is, strekt de uit de internationale inschrijving voortvloeiende bescherming zich uit tot een overeenkomstsluitende Partij. Ten aanzien van de overeenkomstsluitende Partij waarvan de Administratie de Administratie van oorsprong is, kan evenwel niet een zodanig verzoek worden gedaan.  

### Artikel  3ter  

####Verzoek om ,,territoriale uitstrekking”

1.  Een verzoek de uit de internationale inschrijving voortvloeiende bescherming uit te strekken tot een overeenkomstsluitende Partij dient afzonderlijk in de internationale aanvrage te worden vermeld.   
2.  Een verzoek om territoriale uitstrekking kan ook na de internationale inschrijving worden gedaan. Een zodanig verzoek moet worden ingediend op het bij het reglement van uitvoering voorgeschreven formulier. Het wordt onmiddellijk aangetekend door het Internationale Bureau, dat daarvan onverwijld kennisgeeft aan de betrokken Administratie(s). Bedoelde aantekening wordt openbaar gemaakt in het door het Internationale Bureau uitgegeven regelmatig verschijnende blad. Bedoelde territoriale uitstrekking is van kracht vanaf de datum waarop zij is aangetekend in het internationale register; zij houdt op te gelden, wanneer de internationale inschrijving waarop zij betrekking heeft, vervalt.   

### Artikel  4  

####Gevolgen van de internationale inschrijving

1.  

a) Vanaf de datum van inschrijving of aantekening overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de artikelen 3 en 3 <sup>ter</sup>, is de bescherming van het merk in elk van de betrokken overeenkomstsluitende Partijen dezelfde alsof het merk rechtstreeks bij de Administratie van die overeenkomstsluitende Partij was gedeponeerd. Indien aan het Internationale Bureau geen weigering ter kennis is gebracht overeenkomstig artikel 5, eerste en tweede lid, of indien een overeenkomstig genoemd artikel ter kennis gebrachte weigering later is ingetrokken, is de bescherming van het merk in de betrokken overeenkomstsluitende Partij vanaf genoemde datum dezelfde alsof het merk was ingeschreven door de Administratie van die overeenkomstsluitende Partij.  

b) De in artikel 3 bedoelde klasse-indeling van waren en diensten bindt de overeenkomstsluitende Partij niet wat betreft de vaststelling van de omvang van de bescherming van het merk.     
2.  Elke internationale inschrijving geniet het recht van voorrang, vastgesteld bij artikel 4 van het Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom, zonder dat het nodig is de formaliteiten voorgeschreven onder letter D van dat artikel te vervullen.   

### Artikel  4bis  

####Internationale inschrijving in de plaats van een nationale of een regionale inschrijving

1.  Wanneer een merk dat het voorwerp is van een nationale of een regionale inschrijving bij de Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij ook het voorwerp is van een internationale inschrijving en beide inschrijvingen zijn geschied ten name van dezelfde persoon, wordt de internationale inschrijving geacht in de plaats te treden van de nationale of de regionale inschrijving, zonder afbreuk te doen aan de uit hoofde van laatstgenoemde inschrijvingen verkregen rechten, mits 

(i) de uit de internationale inschrijving voortvloeiende bescherming zich uitstrekt tot genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Partij krachtens artikel 3 <sup>ter</sup>, eerste en tweede lid.  

(ii) alle in de nationale of de regionale inschrijving vermelde waren en diensten ook zijn vermeld in de internationale inschrijving met betrekking tot genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Partij,  

(iii) bedoelde uitstrekking van kracht wordt na de datum van de nationale of de regionale inschrijving.     
2.  De in het eerste lid bedoelde Administratie is gehouden op aanvrage in haar register van de internationale inschrijving aantekening te houden.   

### Artikel  5  

####Weigering en nietigverklaring van de internationale inschrijving ten aanzien van bepaalde overeenkomstsluitende Partijen

1.  Wanneer de toepasselijke wetgeving zulks toelaat, heeft een Administratie van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij die door het Internationale Bureau ervan in kennis is gesteld dat uit hoofde van artikel 3 <sup>ter</sup>, eerste of tweede lid, de bescherming voortvloeiende uit de internationale inschrijving zich uitstrekt tot die overeenkomstsluitende Partij, het recht in een kennisgeving van weigering te verklaren dat in genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Partij geen bescherming kan worden verleend aan het merk dat het voorwerp is van bedoelde uitstrekking. Een zodanige weigering is slechts geoorloofd op grond van omstandigheden die, krachtens het Verdrag van Parijs tot bescherming van de industriële eigendom, zouden gelden voor een merk dat rechtstreeks is gedeponeerd bij de Administratie die van de weigering kennisgeeft. De bescherming kan evenwel niet worden geweigerd, zelfs niet gedeeltelijk, enkel op grond van het feit dat de toepasselijke wetgeving de inschrijving slechts in een beperkt aantal klassen of voor een beperkt aantal waren of diensten zou toelaten.   
2.  

a) Een Administratie die van dit recht gebruik wenst te maken dient haar weigering, met opgave van alle redenen, ter kennis te brengen van het Internationale Bureau binnen de termijn voorgeschreven door de voor die Administratie toepasselijke wet en uiterlijk, met inachtneming van de letters b en c, vóór het verstrijken van een jaar te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop de in het eerste lid bedoelde kennisgeving van uitstrekking door het Internationale Bureau aan die Administratie is toegezonden.  

b) Niettegenstaande letter a kan een overeenkomstsluitende Partij verklaren dat voor internationale inschrijvingen uit hoofde van dit Protocol de onder letter a genoemde termijn van een jaar wordt vervangen door 18 maanden.  

c) Bedoelde verklaring kan ook aangeven dat, wanneer een weigering van bescherming het gevolg is van oppositie tegen het verlenen van bescherming, bedoelde weigering door de Administratie van genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Partij aan het Internationale Bureau ter kennis wordt gebracht na het verstrijken van de termijn van 18 maanden. Bedoelde Administratie kan met betrekking tot elke internationale inschrijving een weigering van bescherming ter kennis brengen na het verstrijken van de termijn van 18 maanden, maar slechts indien 

(i) zij vóór het verstrijken van de termijn van 18 maanden het Internationale Bureau heeft ingelicht over de mogelijkheid dat oppositie wordt aangetekend na het verstrijken van de termijn van 18 maanden, en  

(ii) de kennisgeving van de weigering op grond van oppositie plaatsvindt binnen een termijn van ten hoogste een maand te rekenen vanaf het verstrijken van de oppositietermijn en in elk geval uiterlijk zeven maanden na de datum waarop de oppositietermijn aanvangt.    

d) Een verklaring uit hoofde van de letters b of c kan worden afgelegd in de akten bedoeld in artikel 14, tweede lid, en de datum van vankrachtwording van de verklaring is dezelfde als de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol ten aanzien van de Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie die de verklaring heeft afgelegd. Een zodanige verklaring kan ook later worden afgelegd, in welk geval de verklaring van kracht wordt drie maanden nadat zij is ontvangen door de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie (hierna te noemen „de Directeur-Generaal”), of op een latere in de verklaring aangegeven datum, met betrekking tot een internationale inschrijving waarvan de datum dezelfde is als of later valt dan de datum van vankrachtwording van de verklaring.  

e) Na het verstrijken van een termijn van tien jaar te rekenen vanaf de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol bestudeert de Algemene Vergadering de werking van het bij de letters a tot en met d ingestelde stelsel. Daarna kunnen de bepalingen van genoemde letters worden gewijzigd bij een met eenparigheid van stemmen genomen besluit van de Algemene Vergadering . <sup> *  Interpretatieve verklaring aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Unie van Madrid:   ,,Artikel 5, tweede lid, letter e, van het Protocol wordt zodanig uitgelegd dat de Algemene Vergadering de werking van het bij de letters a tot en met d ingestelde stelsel voortdurend kan toetsen, waarbij wel te verstaan is dat voor wijzigingen van deze bepalingen besluiten met eenparigheid van stemmen van de Algemene Vergadering vereist zijn.’’  </sup>     
3.  Het Internationale Bureau zendt onverwijld een van de exemplaren van de kennisgeving van de weigering toe aan de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving. Genoemde rechthebbende heeft dezelfde middelen van beroep als indien het merk door hem rechtstreeks was gedeponeerd bij de Administratie die haar weigering ter kennis heeft gebracht. Wanneer het Internationale Bureau inlichtingen heeft ontvangen uit hoofde van het tweede lid, letter c, punt i, zendt het genoemde inlichtingen onverwijld toe aan de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving.   
4.  De redenen van een weigering van een merk worden door het Internationale Bureau medegedeeld aan elke belanghebbende die zulks verzoekt.   
5.  Een Administratie die met betrekking tot een internationale inschrijving geen voorlopige of definitieve weigering ter kennis heeft gebracht van het Internationale Bureau in overeenstemming met het eerste en het tweede lid, verliest met betrekking tot die internationale inschrijving het recht als bedoeld in het eerste lid.   
6.  De nietigverklaring van een internationale inschrijving door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij voor het grondgebied van die overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan niet worden uitgesproken zonder de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving tijdig in de gelegenheid te hebben gesteld zijn rechten te verdedigen. De nietigverklaring wordt ter kennis gebracht van het Internationale Bureau.   

### Artikel  5bis  

####Bewijsstukken van de wettigheid van het gebruik van bepaalde bestanddelen van het merk

Bewijsstukken van de wettigheid van het gebruik van bepaalde in een merk opgenomen bestanddelen als wapens, wapenschilden, portretten, eervolle onderscheidingen, titels, handelsnamen of namen van personen anders dan die van de aanvrager, of andere overeenkomstige vermeldingen, welke door de Administraties van de overeenkomstsluitende Partijen mochten worden gevorderd, zijn vrijgesteld van elke legalisatie, alsmede van elke andere waarmerking dan die door de Administratie van oorsprong.  

### Artikel  5ter  

####Afschriften van aantekeningen in het register; Nieuwheidsonderzoeken; Uittreksels uit het internationale register

1.  Het Internationale Bureau verstrekt aan een ieder die daartoe aanvraag doet, tegen een in het reglement van uitvoering vastgestelde taks, een afschrift van de aantekeningen in het internationale register met betrekking tot een bepaald merk.   
2.  Het Internationale Bureau kan zich ook tegen vergoeding belasten met een nieuwheidsonderzoek onder de merken die het voorwerp zijn van internationale inschrijvingen.   
3.  Uittreksels uit het internationale register die met het oog op hun overlegging in een der overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn aangevraagd, zijn vrijgesteld van elke legalisatie.   

### Artikel  6  

####Geldigheidsduur van de internationale inschrijving; Afhankelijkheid en onafhankelijkheid van de internationale inschrijving

1.  De inschrijving van een merk bij het Internationale Bureau geschiedt voor tien jaar, met de mogelijkheid tot verlenging onder de in artikel 7 genoemde voorwaarden.   
2.  Na het verstrijken van een termijn van vijf jaar te rekenen vanaf de datum van de internationale inschrijving wordt de inschrijving onafhankelijk van de basisaanvrage of de daaruit voortvloeiende inschrijving, dan wel van de basisinschrijving, naargelang het geval, met inachtneming van de volgende bepalingen.   
3.  De bescherming die voortvloeit uit de al dan niet overgedragen internationale inschrijving kan niet meer worden ingeroepen indien vóór het verstrijken van vijf jaar te rekenen vanaf de datum van de internationale inschrijving, de basisaanvrage of de daaruit voortvloeiende inschrijving, dan wel de basisinschrijving, naargelang het geval, is ingetrokken of verlopen of het voorwerp is geweest van afstand of van een definitieve uitspraak van verwerping, herroeping, doorhaling of nietigverklaring, met betrekking tot alle of enkele waren en diensten die in de internationale inschrijving zijn vermeld. Hetzelfde geldt indien 

(i) een beroep tegen een uitspraak waarbij de rechtsgevolgen van de basisaanvrage worden geweigerd,  

(ii) een rechtsvordering tot intrekking van de basisaanvrage of herroeping, doorhaling of nietigverklaring van de uit de basisaanvrage voortvloeiende inschrijving, dan wel van de basisinschrijving, of  

(iii) oppositie tegen de basisaanvrage  

na het verstrijken van de termijn van vijf jaar, leidt tot een definitieve uitspraak van verwerping, herroeping, doorhaling of nietigverklaring, of een definitieve uitspraak waarbij de intrekking wordt gelast, van de basisaanvrage, of de daaruit voortvloeiende inschrijving, dan wel de basisinschrijving, naargelang het geval, mits het beroep, de rechtsvordering of het verzet aanvang heeft genomen vóór het verstrijken van genoemde termijn. Hetzelfde geldt indien de basisaanvrage is ingetrokken of afstand is gedaan van de uit de basisaanvrage voortvloeiende inschrijving of van de basisinschrijving, na het verstrijken van de termijn van vijf jaar, mits genoemde aanvrage of inschrijving op het tijdstip van de intrekking of de afstand het voorwerp was van een onder de punten i, ii of iii genoemde procedure en bedoelde procedure aanvang heeft genomen vóór het verstrijken van genoemde termijn.     
4.  De Administratie van oorsprong brengt, zoals voorgeschreven in het reglement van uitvoering, de krachtens het derde lid ter zake dienende feiten en uitspraken ter kennis van het Internationale Bureau en het Internationale Bureau stelt, zoals voorgeschreven in het reglement van uitvoering, de belanghebbenden in kennis en verricht dienovereenkomstig alle openbaarmakingen. De Administratie van oorsprong verzoekt, indien van toepassing, het Internationale Bureau de internationale inschrijving, voor zover noodzakelijk, door te halen en het Internationale Bureau handelt dienovereenkomstig.   

### Artikel  7  

####Verlenging van de internationale inschrijving

1.  Een internationale inschrijving kan worden verlengd door een termijn van tien jaar te rekenen vanaf het tijdstip waarop de voorgaan de termijn afloopt, enkel door het storten van het basisemolument en, met inachtneming van artikel 8, zevende lid, van een extra emolument en een aanvullingsemolument als bedoeld in artikel 8, tweede lid.   
2.  Verlenging mag generlei wijziging in de internationale inschrijving in haar laatste vorm met zich meebrengen.   
3.  Zes maanden vóór het verstrijken van de termijn van bescherming herinnert het Internationale Bureau, door het toezenden van een officieus bericht, de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving en zijn eventuele gemachtigde aan de exacte datum waarop de termijn verstrijkt.   
4.  Door storting van een bij het reglement van uitvoering vastgestelde extra taks kan voor de verlenging van de internationale inschrijving een termijn van uitstel van zes maanden worden verleend.   

### Artikel  8  

####Emolumenten voor de internationale aanvrage en inschrijving

1.  De Administratie van oorsprong kan naar eigen goeddunken een taks vaststellen en te haren voordele innen, die zij van de aanvrager van de internationale inschrijving of van de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving kan vorderen in verband met de indiening van de internationale aanvrage of de verlenging van de internationale inschrijving.   
2.  De inschrijving van een merk bij het Internationale Bureau is afhankelijk van de voorafgaande betaling van een internationaal emolument dat, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het zevende lid, letter a, omvat: 

(i) een basisemolument;  

(ii) een extra emolument voor de vierde en elke volgende klasse van de internationale classificatie waarin de waren en diensten waarop het merk betrekking heeft, is ingedeeld; een aanvullingsemolument voor ieder verzoek tot uitstrekking van de bescherming uit hoofde van artikel 3 <sup>ter</sup>.     
3.  Het extra emolument genoemd in het tweede lid, punt ii, kan evenwel, zonder dat zulks ten nadele strekt van de datum van inschrijving, worden betaald binnen een door het reglement van uitvoering vastgestelde termijn indien het aantal klassen van waren of diensten is vastgesteld of wordt betwist door het Internationale Bureau. Indien na het verstrijken van genoemde termijn het extra emolument niet is betaald of de lijst van waren of diensten niet in de vereiste mate door de aanvrager is beperkt, wordt de internationale aanvrage als vervallen beschouwd.   
4.  De jaarlijkse opbrengst van de verschillende ontvangsten voor de internationale inschrijving, met uitzondering van de in het tweede lid, punten ii en iii, genoemde, worden in gelijke delen onder de overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verdeeld door het Internationale Bureau, na aftrek van de kosten en lasten gemoeid met de uitvoering van dit Protocol.   
5.  Het totaalbedrag van de in het tweede lid, punt ii, bedoelde extra emolumenten wordt aan het einde van elk jaar onder de betrokken overeenkomstsluitende Partijen verdeeld naar evenredigheid van het aantal merken waarvoor in elk van die Partijen in dat jaar bescherming is aangevraagd, waarbij dit aantal, wat betreft de overeenkomstsluitende Partijen die een vooronderzoek kennen, met een door het reglement van uitvoering te bepalen coëfficiënt wordt vermenigvuldigd.   
6.  Het totaalbedrag van de in het tweede lid, punt iii, bedoelde aanvullingsemolumenten wordt verdeeld volgens dezelfde regels als bepaald in het vijfde lid.   
7.  

a) Een overeenkomstsluitende Partij kan verklaren dat zij, in verband met elke internationale inschrijving waarin zij is vermeld uit hoofde van artikel 3 <sup>ter</sup> en in verband met de verlenging van elke zodanige internationale inschrijving, in plaats van een aandeel in de opbrengst van het extra emolument en het aanvullingsemolument, een emolument (hierna te noemen „het individuele emolument”) wenst te ontvangen, waarvan het bedrag wordt vermeld in de verklaring en dat kan worden gewijzigd in latere verklaringen, maar dat niet hoger mag zijn dan het bedrag dat de Administratie van genoemde overeenkomstsluitende Partij gerechtigd zou zijn om te ontvangen van een aanvrager voor een inschrijving van tien jaar, dan wel van de rechthebbende op een inschrijving voor de verlenging met tien jaar van die inschrijving, van het merk in het register van genoemde Administratie, waarbij bedoeld bedrag wordt verminderd met de besparingen voortvloeiende uit de internationale procedure. Wanneer een zodanig individueel emolument verschuldigd is, 

(i) zijn geen extra emolumenten als bedoeld in het tweede lid, punt i, verschuldigd indien uit hoofde van artikel 3 <sup>ter</sup> slechts overeenkomstsluitende Partijen zijn vermeld die een verklaring uit hoofde van dit lid hebben afgelegd, en  

(ii) zijn geen aanvullingsemolumenten als bedoeld in het tweede lid, punt iii, verschuldigd ten aanzien van een overeenkomstsluitende Partij die een verklaring heeft afgelegd uit hoofde van dit lid.    

b) Een verklaring uit hoofde van dit lid, letter a, kan worden afgelegd in de akten bedoeld in artikel 14, tweede lid, en de datum van vankrachtwording van de verklaring is dezelfde als de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol ten aanzien van de Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie die de verklaring heeft afgelegd.   Een zodanige verklaring kan ook later worden afgelegd, in welk geval de verklaring van kracht wordt drie maanden nadat zij is ontvangen door de Directeur-Generaal, of op een latere in de verklaring aangegeven datum, met betrekking tot een internationale inschrijving waarvan de datum dezelfde is als of later valt dan de datum van vankrachtwording van de verklaring.   

### Artikel  9  

####Aantekening van wijzigingen in de eigendom van een internationale inschrijving

Op verzoek van de persoon ten name van wie de internationale inschrijving is geschied, of op verzoek van een belanghebbende Administratie, die dit verzoek ambtshalve doet, of op verzoek van een belanghebbende, houdt het Internationale Bureau in het internationale register aantekening van elke wijziging in de eigendom van die inschrijving ten aanzien van alle of enkele overeenkomstsluitende Partijen op het grondgebied waarvan genoemde inschrijving van kracht is en met betrekking tot alle of enkele waren en diensten die in de inschrijving zijn vermeld, mits de nieuwe rechthebbende een persoon is die krachtens artikel 2, eerste lid, gerechtigd is internationale aanvragen in te dienen.  

### Artikel  9bis  

####Aantekening van bepaalde aangelegenheden betreffende een internationale inschrijving

Het Internationale Bureau houdt in het internationale register aantekening van 

(i) elke naams- of adreswijziging van de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving,  

(ii) de aanwijzing van een gemachtigde van de rechthebbende op de internationale inschrijving en elk ander ter zake dienend feit betreffende de gemachtigde,  

(iii) elke beperking met betrekking tot alle of enkele overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van de waren en diensten vermeld in de internationale inschrijving,  

(iv) elke afstand, doorhaling of nietigverklaring van de internationale inschrijving ten aanzien van alle of enkele overeenkomstsluitende Partijen,
