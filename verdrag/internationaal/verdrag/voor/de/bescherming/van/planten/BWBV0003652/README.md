####International Plant Protection Convention

Preamble The contracting parties, 

– recognizing the necessity for international cooperation in controlling pests of plants and plant products and in preventing their international spread, and especially their introduction into endangered areas;  

– recognizing that phytosanitary measures should be technically justified, transparent and should not be applied in such a way as to constitute either a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction, particularly on international trade;  

– desiring to ensure close coordination of measures directed to these ends;  

– desiring to provide a framework for the development and application of harmonized phytosanitary measures and the elaboration of international standards to that effect;  

– taking into account internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human and animal health, and the environment; and  

– noting the agreements concluded as a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, including the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures;     have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I

### Article  VII  

####Requirements in relation to imports

1.  With the aim of preventing the introduction and/or spread of regulated pests into their territories, contracting parties shall have sovereign authority to regulate, in accordance with applicable international agreements, the entry of plants and plant products and other regulated articles and, to this end, may: 

a. prescribe and adopt phytosanitary measures concerning the importation of plants, plant products and other regulated articles, including, for example, inspection, prohibition on importation, and treatment;  

b. refuse entry or detain, or require treatment, destruction or removal from the territory of the contracting party, of plants, plant products and other regulated articles or consignments thereof that do not comply with the phytosanitary measures prescribed or adopted under subparagraph (a);  

c. prohibit or restrict the movement of regulated pests into their territories;  

d. prohibit or restrict the movement of biological control agents and other organisms of phytosanitary concern claimed to be beneficial into their territories.     
2.  In order to minimize interference with international trade, each contracting party, in exercising its authority under paragraph 1 of this Article, undertakes to act in conformity with the following: 

a. Contracting parties shall not, under their phytosanitary legislation, take any of the measures specified in paragraph 1 of this Article unless such measures are made necessary by phytosanitary considerations and are technically justified.  

b. Contracting parties shall, immediately upon their adoption, publish and transmit phytosanitary requirements, restrictions and prohibitions to any contracting party or parties that they believe may be directly affected by such measures.  

c. Contracting parties shall, on request, make available to any contracting party the rationale for phytosanitary requirements, restrictions and prohibitions.  

d. If a contracting party requires consignments of particular plants or plant products to be imported only through specified points of entry, such points shall be so selected as not to unnecessarily impede international trade. The contracting party shall publish a list of such points of entry and communicate it to the Secretary, any regional plant protection organization of which the contracting party is a member, all contracting parties which the contracting party believes to be directly affected, and other contracting parties upon request. Such restrictions on points of entry shall not be made unless the plants, plant products or other regulated articles concerned are required to be accompanied by phytosanitary certificates or to be submitted to inspection or treatment.  

e. Any inspection or other phytosanitary procedure required by the plant protection organization of a contracting party for a consignment of plants, plant products or other regulated articles offered for importation, shall take place as promptly as possible with due regard to their perishability.  

f. Importing contracting parties shall, as soon as possible, inform the exporting contracting party concerned or, where appropriate, the re-exporting contracting party concerned, of significant instances of non-compliance with phytosanitary certification. The exporting contracting party or, where appropriate, the re-exporting contracting party concerned, should investigate and, on request, report the result of its investigation to the importing contracting party concerned.  

g. Contracting parties shall institute only phytosanitary measures that are technically justified, consistent with the pest risk involved and represent the least restrictive measures available, and result in the minimum impediment to the international movement of people, commodities and conveyances.  

h. Contracting parties shall, as conditions change, and as new facts become available, ensure that phytosanitary measures are promptly modified or removed if found to be unnecessary.  

i. Contracting parties shall, to the best of their ability, establish and update lists of regulated pests, using scientific names, and make such lists available to the Secretary, to regional plant protection organizations of which they are members and, on request, to other contracting parties.  

j. Contracting parties shall, to the best of their ability, conduct surveillance for pests and develop and maintain adequate information on pest status in order to support categorization of pests, and for the development of appropriate phytosanitary measures. This information shall be made available to contracting parties, on request.     
3.  A contracting party may apply measures specified in this Article to pests which may not be capable of establishment in its territories but, if they gained entry, cause economic damage. Measures taken against these pests must be technically justified.   
4.  Contracting parties may apply measures specified in this Article to consignments in transit through their territories only where such measures are technically justified and necessary to prevent the introduction and/or spread of pests.   
5.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent importing contracting parties from making special provision, subject to adequate safeguards, for the importation, for the purpose of scientific research, education, or other specific use, of plants and plant products and other regulated articles, and of plant pests.   
6.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent any contracting party from taking appropriate emergency action on the detection of a pest posing a potential threat to its territories or the report of such a detection. Any such action shall be evaluated as soon as possible to ensure that its continuance is justified. The action taken shall be immediately reported to contracting parties concerned, the Secretary, and any regional plant protection organization of which the contracting party is a member.

g) De Verdragsluitende Partijen stellen uitsluitend fytosanitaire maatregelen in die technisch gerechtvaardigd zijn en in overeenstemming zijn met het ziekte- of plaagrisico, en die de minst beperkende maatregelen zijn die beschikbaar zijn en die zo min mogelijk het internationale verkeer van mensen, goederen en vervoermiddelen belemmeren.  

h) De Verdragsluitende Partijen dragen er zorg voor dat, bij veranderende omstandigheden en nieuwe feiten, de fytosanitaire maatregelen onmiddellijk worden gewijzigd of ingetrokken indien deze onnodig worden bevonden.  

i) De Verdragsluitende Partijen dragen er zo goed mogelijk zorg voor dat zij lijsten van gereguleerde ziekten en plagen opstellen en bijhouden, met gebruikmaking van de wetenschappelijke namen, en deze ter beschikking stellen aan de Secretaris, de regionale organisaties voor de bescherming van planten waarvan zij lid zijn en, op verzoek, aan andere Verdragsluitende Partijen;  

j) De Verdragsluitende Partijen zullen zo goed mogelijk toezicht houden op ziekten en plagen en adequate gegevens verzamelen en bijhouden over de ontwikkeling van de ziekte of plaag teneinde de onderverdeling van ziekten in categorieën te ondersteunen, en voor de ontwikkeling van passende fytosanitaire maatregelen. Deze gegevens worden op verzoek aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen ter beschikking gesteld.     
3.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan de in dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen toepassen op ziekten die mogelijk niet in staat zijn zich te vestigen op haar grondgebied, maar, indien zij haar grondgebied zouden binnenkomen, economische schade zouden veroorzaken. De tegen deze ziekten en plagen getroffen maatregelen moeten technisch gerechtvaardigd zijn.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen de in dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen alleen op transito-goederen door hun grondgebied toepassen wanneer deze maatregelen technisch gerechtvaardigd zijn en noodzakelijk zijn voor de voorkoming van het binnendringen en/of de verspreiding van ziekten en plagen.   
5.  Niets in dit artikel weerhoudt importerende Verdragsluitende Partijen ervan speciale voorzieningen op te stellen, met inachtneming van gepaste waarborgen, ten aanzien van de invoer, ten behoeve van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, onderwijs of andere specifieke doeleinden, van planten, plantaardige producten en andere gereguleerde artikelen en van plantenziekten en -plagen.   
6.  Niets in dit artikel weerhoudt een Verdragsluitende Partij ervan de passende noodmaatregelen te nemen naar aanleiding van het ontdekken van een ziekte of plaag die een potentiële bedreiging voor haar grondgebied betekent, of de melding van een dergelijke ontdekking. Deze maatregelen worden zo snel mogelijk geëvalueerd teneinde ervoor zorg te dragen dat de voortzetting hiervan wordt gerechtvaardigd. De genomen maatregelen worden onmiddellijk gemeld aan de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen, aan de Secretaris en aan alle regionale organisaties voor de bescherming van planten waarvan de Verdragsluitende Partij lid is.

Indien er een geschil bestaat betreffende de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag, of indien een Verdragsluitende Partij van mening is dat een handeling van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij in strijd is met de verplichtingen van die Partij krachtens de artikelen V en VII van dit Verdrag, vooral met betrekking tot de gronden voor het verbieden of beperken van de invoer van planten, plantaardige producten of andere gereguleerde artikelen die uit haar grondgebieden komen, treden de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen zo snel mogelijk in onderling overleg teneinde tot een oplossing voor het geschil te komen.   
2.  Indien het geschil niet kan worden opgelost met de in het eerste lid bedoelde middelen, kan de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij of kunnen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO verzoeken een commissie van deskundigen te benoemen om het geschil te onderzoeken, in overeenstemming met de regels en procedures die door de Commissie kunnen worden opgesteld.   
3.  In de commissie van deskundigen nemen vertegenwoordigers zitting die door elk van de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen worden aangewezen. De commissie van deskundigen onderzoekt het geschil, rekening houdend met alle documenten en ander bewijsmateriaal die door de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen worden ingediend. De commissie van deskundigen stelt een rapport samen met betrekking tot de technische aspecten van het geschil met het doel tot een oplossing van het geschil te komen. De voorbereiding van het rapport en de goedkeuring daarvan geschieden overeenkomstig de door de Commissie opgestelde regels en procedures, en het wordt door de Directeur-Generaal gezonden naar de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen. Het rapport kan eveneens, op verzoek daartoe van de desbetreffende instantie, worden voorgelegd aan de bevoegde instantie van de internationale organisatie die is belast met het oplossen van handelsgeschillen.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen dat de aanbevelingen van een zodanige commissie van deskundigen, hoewel niet bindend, tot uitgangspunt zullen dienen voor het opnieuw bestuderen van de zaak naar aanleiding waarvan het geschil gerezen is door de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
5.  De betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen dragen elk een gelijk aandeel in de kosten van deskundigen.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel vormen een aanvulling op en doen geen afbreuk aan procedures voor de beslechting van geschillen vastgelegd in andere internationale overeenkomsten waarin handelskwesties worden geregeld.   

### Artikel  XIV  

####Vervanging van vroegere overeenkomsten

Dit Verdrag beëindigt en vervangt tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen de Internationale Overeenkomst tot wering van de druifluis (Phylloxera) van 3 november 1881, de aanvullende Conventie ondertekend te Bern op 15 april 1889 en het Internationale Verdrag tot bescherming van planten ondertekend te Rome op 16 april 1929.  

### Artikel  XV  

####Territoriale toepassing

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan ten tijde van de bekrachtiging of de toetreding of op ieder tijdstip daarna, aan de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO een verklaring doen toekomen dat dit Verdrag mede van toepassing is op alle of bepaalde gebieden voor de internationale betrekkingen waarvan deze Verdragsluitende Partij verantwoordelijk is. Dit Verdrag is op alle in deze verklaring genoemde gebieden van toepassing met ingang van de dertigste dag na ontvangst van de verklaring door de Directeur-Generaal.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die aan de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO een verklaring heeft doen toekomen overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel, kan te allen tijde een aanvullende verklaring indienen die de draagwijdte van vroegere verklaringen wijzigt of een eind maakt aan de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag met betrekking tot een gebied. Een zodanige wijziging of beëindiging wordt van kracht met ingang van de dertigste dag na ontvangst van de verklaring door de Directeur-Generaal.   
3.  De Directeur-Generaal van de FAO doet aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen mededeling van alle krachtens dit artikel ontvangen verklaringen.   

### Artikel  XVI  

####Aanvullende overeenkomsten

1.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen, voor het behandelen van bijzondere problemen op het gebied van de bescherming van planten die speciale aandacht of optreden vereisen, aanvullende overeenkomsten sluiten. Deze overeenkomsten kunnen van toepassing zijn op specifieke regio's, specifieke ziekten, specifieke planten en plantaardige producten, specifieke wijzen van internationaal vervoer van planten en plantaardige producten, of anderszins een aanvulling vormen op de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Iedere aanvullende overeenkomst treedt voor elke betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij in werking na de aanvaarding daarvan in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de desbetreffende aanvullende overeenkomsten.   
3.  De aanvullende overeenkomsten ondersteunen de intentie van dit Verdrag en dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met de beginselen en de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, alsmede met de beginselen van doorzichtigheid, non-discriminatie en het vermijden van verkapte beperkingen, met name ten aanzien van de internationale handel.   

### Artikel  XVII  

####Bekrachtiging en toetreding

2.  Zodra dit Verdrag ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel XXII in werking is getreden, kunnen de niet-ondertekenende Staten en de Lidorganisaties van de FAO toetreden. Toetreding geschiedt door nederlegging van een akte van toetreding bij de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO die daarvan mededeling doet aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Wanneer een Lidorganisatie van de FAO een Partij bij dit Verdrag wordt, doet de Lidorganisatie overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel II, zevende lid, van het Statuut van de FAO, indien nodig, ten tijde van haar toetreding, mededeling van die wijzigingen of ophelderingen ten aanzien van haar bevoegdheidsverklaring die is ingediend op grond van artikel II, vijfde lid, van het Statuut van de FAO die nodig zijn voor haar aanvaarding van dit Verdrag. Iedere Partij bij dit Verdrag kan, te allen tijde, een Lidorganisatie van de FAO die een Partij bij dit Verdrag is verzoeken om informatie teneinde te achterhalen wie, de Lidorganisatie of de lidstaten daarvan, verantwoordelijk is voor de uitvoering van specifieke aangelegenheden waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is. De Lidorganisatie verstrekt deze informatie binnen een redelijke termijn.   

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Niet-Verdragsluitende Partijen

De Verdragsluitende Partijen moedigen iedere staat of Lidorganisatie van de FAO die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag, aan dit Verdrag te aanvaarden, en moedigen iedere niet-verdragsluitende partij aan fytosanitaire maatregelen toe te passen die in overeenstemming zijn met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en met alle ingevolge dit Verdrag aangenomen internationale standaarden.  

### Artikel  XIX  

####Talen

1.  De authentieke talen van dit Verdrag zijn alle officiële talen van de FAO.   
2.

### Artikel  XX  

####Technische bijstand

De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen de verlening van technische bijstand aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen te bevorderen, met name aan de in ontwikkeling zijnde Verdragsluitende Partijen, hetzij op bilaterale basis of door tussenkomst van de desbetreffende internationale organisaties, teneinde de uitvoering van dit Verdrag te vergemakkelijken.  

### Artikel  XXI  

####Wijziging

1.  Elk voorstel van een Verdragsluitende Partij tot wijziging van dit Verdrag moet bij de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO worden ingediend.   
2.  Elk voorstel tot wijziging van dit Verdrag dat door de Directeur- Generaal van de FAO van een Verdragsluitende Partij is ontvangen, moet aan een gewone of buitengewone zitting van de Commissie ter goedkeuring worden voorgelegd. Indien de wijziging belangrijke technische veranderingen inhoudt of aanvullende verplichtingen oplegt aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen, moet deze door een uit deskundigen bestaande en door de FAO bijeengeroepen adviescommissie worden onderzocht, alvorens ter goedkeuring aan de Commissie te worden voorgelegd.   
3.  Van elke voorgestelde wijziging van dit Verdrag, behalve van wijziging van de Bijlage, moet door de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen bericht worden gezonden; dit dient uiterlijk te geschieden op het tijdstip waarop de agenda van de zitting van de Commissie waarin de zaak behandeld zal worden, verzonden wordt.   
4.  Voor elke voorgestelde wijziging van dit Verdrag is de goedkeuring vereist van de Commissie; zij wordt van kracht op de dertigste dag nadat zij door twee derde van de Verdragsluitende Partijen is aanvaard. Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt een door een Lidorganisatie van de FAO nedergelegde akte niet beschouwd als een aanvulling op akten die zijn nedergelegd door de lidstaten van een dergelijke organisatie.   
5.  Wijzigingen die nieuwe verplichtingen inhouden voor de Verdragsluitende Partijen worden echter pas voor elk van de Verdragsluitende Partijen afzonderlijk van kracht op de dertigste dag na aanvaarding door die Verdragsluitende Partij. De akten van aanvaarding van wijzigingen die nieuwe verplichtingen inhouden, worden nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO, die alle Verdragsluitende Partijen mededeling doet van de ontvangst van zodanige akten en van het van kracht worden van de wijzigingen.   
6.  Voorstellen tot wijziging van de in de Bijlage van dit Verdrag opgenomen modellen van fytosanitaire certificaten worden gezonden aan de Secretaris en worden door de Commissie ter goedkeuring onderzocht. Goedgekeurde wijzigingen van het in de Bijlage bij dit Verdrag opgenomen model van fytosanitaire certificaten worden van kracht negentig dagen nadat hiervan door de Secretaris mededeling is gedaan aan de Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
7.  Gedurende een periode van ten hoogste twaalf maanden gerekend vanaf het moment van wijziging van de in de Bijlage van dit Verdrag opgenomen fytosanitaire certificaten tot het moment waarop dit Verdrag van kracht wordt, heeft de voorgaande versie van de certificaten voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag eveneens juridische geldigheid.   

### Artikel  XXII  

####Inwerkingtreding

Zodra dit Verdrag door drie ondertekenende Staten is bekrachtigd, zal het tussen hen in werking treden. Het treedt ten aanzien van elke daarna bekrachtigende of toetredende Staat of Lidorganisatie van de FAO in werking met ingang van de datum van nederlegging van zijn c.q. haar akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.  

### Artikel  XXIII  

####Opzegging

1.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan te allen tijde bericht van opzegging van dit Verdrag zenden, welk bericht gericht moet zijn aan de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO. De Directeur-Generaal doet hiervan onmiddellijk mededeling aan alle Verdragsluitende Partijen.   
2.  De opzegging wordt van kracht één jaar na de datum van ontvangst van het bericht door de Directeur-Generaal van de FAO.
