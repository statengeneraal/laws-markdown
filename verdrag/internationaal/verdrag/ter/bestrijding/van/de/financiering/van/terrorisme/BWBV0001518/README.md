##Internationaal Verdrag ter bestrijding van de financiering van terrorisme

####International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism

Preamble The States Parties to this Convention, Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of good-neighbourliness and friendly relations and cooperation among States, Deeply concerned about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, Recalling the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, contained in General Assembly resolution 50/6 of 24 October 1995, Recalling also all the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the matter, including resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994 and its annex on the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, in which the States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaffirmed their unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomever committed, including those which jeopardize the friendly relations among States and peoples and threaten the territorial integrity and security of States, Noting that the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism also encouraged States to review urgently the scope of the existing international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimination of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that there is a comprehensive legal framework covering all aspects of the matter, Recalling General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, paragraph 3, subparagraph (f), in which the Assembly called upon all States to take steps to prevent and counteract, through appropriate domestic measures, the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations, whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable, social or cultural goals or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking, drug dealing and racketeering, including the exploitation of persons for purposes of funding terrorist activities, and in particular to consider, where appropriate, adopting regulatory measures to prevent and counteract movements of funds suspected to be intended for terrorist purposes without impeding in any way the freedom of legitimate capital movements and to intensify the exchange of information concerning international movements of such funds, Recalling also General Assembly resolution 52/165 of 15 December 1997, in which the Assembly called upon States to consider, in particular, the implementation of the measures set out in paragraphs 3 (a) to (f) of its resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Recalling further General Assembly resolution 53/108 of 8 December 1998, in which the Assembly decided that the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 should elaborate a draft international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing to supplement related existing international instruments, Considering that the financing of terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole, Noting that the number and seriousness of acts of international terrorism depend on the financing that terrorists may obtain, Noting also that existing multilateral legal instruments do not expressly address such financing, Being convinced of the urgent need to enhance international cooperation among States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators, Have agreed as follows:

### Article  11  

1.

When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested State Party may, at its option, consider this Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State.

4.  If necessary, the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated, for the purposes of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 7, paragraphs 1 and 2.

4.  Each State Party may give consideration to establishing mechanisms to share with other States Parties information or evidence needed to establish criminal, civil or administrative liability pursuant to article 5.   
5.  States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance or information exchange that may exist between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrangements, States Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their domestic law.   

### Article  13  

None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded, for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance, as a fiscal offence. Accordingly, States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that it concerns a fiscal offence.

### Article  15  

Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance, if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons.  

### Article  16  

1.  A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of identification, testimony or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the investigation or prosecution of offences set forth in article 2 may be transferred if the following conditions are met:

Preambule De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, Indachtig de doelstellingen en beginselen van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties betreffende de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid en de bevordering van goed nabuurschap, vriendschappelijke betrekkingen en samenwerking tussen Staten, Ernstig bezorgd over de toename over de gehele wereld van daden van terrorisme, in al zijn gedaantes en verschijningsvormen; In herinnering brengend de Verklaring van 24 oktober 1995 ter gelegenheid van het vijftigjarig bestaan van de Verenigde Naties, vervat in resolutie 50/6 van de Algemene Vergadering van 24 oktober 1995; Tevens in herinnering brengend alle relevante resoluties terzake van de Algemene Vergadering, waaronder resolutie 49/60 van 9 december 1994 met als bijlage de Verklaring inzake maatregelen tot uitbanning van internationaal terrorisme, waarin de lidstaten van de Verenigde Naties opnieuw plechtig hun ondubbelzinnige veroordeling bevestigen van alle terroristische daden, methoden en praktijken als misdadig en ongerechtvaardigd, ongeacht waar en door wie zij zijn begaan, met inbegrip van daden die de vriendschappelijke betrekkingen tussen Staten en volkeren schaden en de territoriale integriteit en veiligheid van Staten bedreigen; Vaststellend dat de Verklaring inzake maatregelen tot uitbanning van internationaal terrorisme Staten tevens aanmoedigt het toepassingsgebied van de bestaande internationale wettelijke bepalingen inzake de preventie, bestrijding en uitbanning van terrorisme in al zijn gedaantes en verschijningsvormen spoedig te herzien teneinde een volledig wettelijk kader te scheppen dat alle aspecten van terrorisme omvat; In herinnering brengend resolutie 51/210 van de Algemene Vergadering van 17 december 1996, derde alinea, onderdeel f., waarin de Vergadering alle Staten opriep om stappen te ondernemen voor het, met passende nationale maatregelen, voorkomen en verhinderen van de financiering van terroristen en terroristische organisaties, of deze financiering nu rechtstreeks is of onrechtstreeks via organisaties die ook liefdadige, sociale of culturele doelstellingen hebben of voorgeven te hebben of die tevens zijn betrokken bij wederrechtelijke activiteiten zoals onwettige wapenhandel, handel in verdovende middelen en afpersing, waaronder het inzetten van personen ten dienste van het financieren van terroristische activiteiten, en in het bijzonder om te overwegen waar nodig regulerende maatregelen te nemen voor het voorkomen en verhinderen van verkeer van fondsen waarvan wordt vermoed dat zij bestemd zijn voor terroristische doeleinden, zonder op enige wijze de vrijheid van rechtmatig kapitaalverkeer te belemmeren, alsmede de uitwisseling van informatie over het internationale verkeer van dergelijke fondsen te intensiveren; Tevens in herinnering brengend resolutie 52/165 van de Algemene Vergadering van 15 december 1997, waarin de Vergadering Staten opriep in het bijzonder aandacht te schenken aan de uitvoering van de maatregelen in de derde alinea a. tot en met f. van haar resolutie 51/210 van 17 december 1996; Voorts in herinnering brengend resolutie 53/108 van de Algemene Vergadering van 8 december 1998, waarin de Vergadering besloot dat het bij resolutie 51/210 van de Algemene Vergadering van 17 december 1996 ingestelde Comité ad hoc een ontwerp moest opstellen voor een internationaal verdrag ter bestrijding van de financiering van het terrorisme, als aanvulling op hiermee verband houdende bestaande internationale instrumenten; Overwegende dat de financiering van terrorisme de gehele internationale gemeenschap ernstig verontrust; Vaststellend dat aantal en ernst van daden van internationaal terrorisme afhankelijk is van de financiering die terroristen kunnen verkrijgen; Tevens vaststellend dat de bestaande multilaterale juridische instrumenten zich niet expliciet richten op dergelijke financiering; Overtuigd van de dringende noodzaak tot verbetering van de internationale samenwerking tussen Staten bij het opstellen en nemen van doeltreffende maatregelen ter voorkoming van de financiering van terrorisme, alsmede ter bestrijding ervan door vervolging en bestraffing van de daders; Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:

1.  Een persoon pleegt een strafbaar feit in de zin van dit Verdrag indien deze persoon met enig middel, rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks, wederrechtelijk en opzettelijk fondsen verstrekt of vergaart met de bedoeling die te gebruiken of met de wetenschap dat die, geheel of gedeeltelijk, gebruikt zullen worden ter uitvoering van: 

a. een gedraging/handeling die een strafbaar feit vormt binnen het toepassingsgebied van en als omschreven in een van de verdragen vermeld in de bijlage; of  

b. enige andere gedraging/handeling bedoeld om de dood van of ernstig lichamelijk letsel te veroorzaken bij een burger, of een ander persoon die niet actief deelneemt aan de vijandelijkheden in een situatie van gewapend conflict, wanneer het doel van die gedraging/handeling, door haar aard of context, is een bevolking te intimideren of een regering of internationale organisatie te dwingen tot het verrichten of het zich onthouden van een handeling;     
2.  

a. Bij de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding kan een Staat die Partij is, maar die geen partij is bij een verdrag vermeld in de bijlage, verklaren dat, voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag op de Staat die Partij is, het verdrag wordt geacht niet te zijn opgenomen in de in het eerste lid, onderdeel a. bedoelde bijlage. De verklaring is niet langer van kracht zodra het verdrag in werking treedt voor de Staat die Partij is. Deze Staat stelt de depositaris van dit feit in kennis.  

b. Wanneer een Staat ophoudt partij te zijn bij een in de bijlage vermeld verdrag, kan hij een verklaring, als beoogd in dit artikel, afleggen ten aanzien van dat verdrag.     
3.  Om een gedraging/handeling een strafbaar feit te doen zijn als omschreven in het eerste lid, is het niet noodzakelijk dat de fondsen feitelijk zijn gebruikt voor het plegen van een strafbaar feit bedoeld in het eerste lid, onderdelen a. of b.   
4.  Een persoon pleegt eveneens een strafbaar feit indien deze persoon een poging doet tot het plegen van een strafbaar feit in de zin van het eerste lid van dit artikel.

Deze aansprakelijkheid kan straf-, civiel- of bestuursrechtelijk zijn.   
2.  Deze aansprakelijkheid geldt onverminderd de strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid van de natuurlijke personen die de strafbare feiten hebben gepleegd.   
3.  Elke Staat die Partij is ziet er in het bijzonder op toe dat de overeenkomstig het bovenstaande eerste lid aansprakelijke rechtspersonen worden onderworpen aan doeltreffende, evenredige en afschrikkende straf-, civiel- of bestuursrechtelijke sancties. Dergelijke sancties kunnen geldelijke sancties omvatten.   

### Artikel  6  

Elke Staat die Partij is treft de nodige maatregelen, eventueel met inbegrip van de benodigde nationale wetgeving, om te verzekeren dat strafbare gedragingen/handelingen die vallen binnen het toepassingsgebied van dit Verdrag onder geen enkele omstandigheid worden gerechtvaardigd door overwegingen van politieke, filosofische, ideologische, raciale, etnische, religieuze of andere soortgelijke aard.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  Elke Staat die Partij is neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn rechtsmacht te vestigen met betrekking tot de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten indien: 

a. het strafbare feit is gepleegd op het grondgebied van die Staat;

b. het strafbare feit was gericht tegen, of heeft geleid tot het plegen van een strafbaar feit als bedoeld in artikel 2, eerste lid, onderdelen a. of b., tegen een in het buitenland gevestigde staats- of regeringsvoorziening van die Staat, met inbegrip van diplomatieke of consulaire gebouwen van die Staat;  

c. het strafbare feit was gericht tegen, of heeft geleid tot het plegen van een strafbaar feit als bedoeld in artikel 2, eerste lid, onderdelen a. of b., in een poging die Staat te dwingen tot het verrichten of het zich onthouden van een handeling;

Elke Staat die Partij is en die dit Verdrag bekrachtigt, aanvaardt, goedkeurt of ertoe toetreedt, stelt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties in kennis van de rechtsmacht die hij overeenkomstig het tweede lid heeft gevestigd. Indien zich wijzigingen voordoen, stelt de betrokken Staat die Partij is de Secretaris-Generaal daarvan onmiddellijk in kennis.   
4.  Elke Staat die Partij is neemt tevens de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn rechtsmacht te vestigen met betrekking tot de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten in gevallen waarin de vermoedelijke dader zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt en hij deze persoon niet uitlevert aan een Staat die Partij is en die zijn rechtsmacht heeft gevestigd in overeenstemming met het eerste of tweede lid.   
5.  Wanneer meer dan een Staat die Partij is aanspraak maakt op rechtsmacht met betrekking tot de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, streven de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn ernaar hun optreden op passende wijze te coördineren, in het bijzonder betreffende de voorwaarden voor vervolging en de modaliteiten voor wederzijdse rechtshulp.   
6.  Onverminderd de maatstaven van algemeen internationaal recht sluit dit Verdrag niet de uitoefening uit van enige rechtsmacht in strafrechtelijke aangelegenheden die een Staat die Partij is in overeenstemming met zijn nationale wetgeving heeft gevestigd.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Elke Staat die Partij is neemt passende maatregelen, in overeenstemming met zijn nationale rechtsbeginselen, voor het identificeren, opsporen en bevriezen of in beslag nemen van alle fondsen gebruikt of bestemd ten dienste van het plegen van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, alsmede de opbrengsten afkomstig van dergelijke strafbare feiten, ten behoeve van eventuele verbeurdverklaring.

4.  Elke Staat die Partij is overweegt het instellen van mechanismen waarmee de fondsen afkomstig van de in dit artikel bedoelde verbeurdverklaringen worden aangewend voor het schadeloos stellen van de slachtoffers van strafbare feiten als bedoeld in artikel 2, eerste lid, onderdelen a. of b., of hun verwanten.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel worden toegepast onverminderd de rechten van te goeder trouw handelende derden.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Indien een Staat die Partij is informatie verkrijgt dat de pleger of vermoedelijke pleger van een in artikel 2 omschreven strafbaar feit zich mogelijk op zijn grondgebied bevindt, neemt de desbetreffende Staat die Partij is de maatregelen die krachtens zijn nationale recht nodig zijn voor een onderzoek naar de in de verstrekte informatie opgenomen feiten.   
2.  Een Staat die Partij is en op wiens grondgebied de dader of vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, neemt, indien hij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden dit rechtvaardigen, in overeenstemming met zijn nationale recht de passende maatregelen ter verzekering van de aanwezigheid van die persoon ten behoeve van strafvervolging of uitlevering.   
3.  Een ieder tegen wie de in het tweede lid genoemde maatregelen worden genomen heeft het recht: 

a. zich onverwijld in verbinding te stellen met de dichtstbijzijnde daarvoor in aanmerking komende vertegenwoordiger van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is of die anderszins gerechtigd is om de rechten van deze persoon te beschermen of, indien het een staatloze betreft, de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan die persoon zijn vaste verblijfplaats heeft;  

b. te worden bezocht door een vertegenwoordiger van die Staat;  

c. te worden geïnformeerd over zijn rechten op grond van de onderdelen a. en b.     
4.  De in het derde lid bedoelde rechten worden uitgeoefend in overeenstemming met de wetten en voorschriften van de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de dader of vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, met dien verstande dat de genoemde wetten en voorschriften het mogelijk maken dat de doeleinden die met de krachtens het derde lid verleende rechten worden beoogd, volledig kunnen worden verwezenlijkt.   
5.  De bepalingen van het derde en vierde lid gelden onverminderd het recht van een Staat die Partij is die zich beroept op rechtsmacht overeenkomstig artikel 7, eerste lid, onderdeel c., of tweede lid, onderdeel d., het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis te verzoeken zich in verbinding te stellen met de vermoedelijke dader en deze te bezoeken.   
6.  Wanneer een Staat die Partij is krachtens dit artikel een persoon in detentie heeft gesteld, stelt hij de Staten die Partij zijn die overeenkomstig artikel 7, eerste en tweede lid, hun rechtsmacht hebben gevestigd, alsmede wanneer hij dit nodig acht alle andere belanghebbende Staten die Partij zijn, rechtstreeks of via de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, onverwijld in kennis van het feit dat de betrokken persoon in detentie is gesteld en van de omstandigheden die zijn detentie rechtvaardigen. De Staat die het in het eerste lid bedoelde onderzoek instelt, deelt zijn bevindingen onverwijld mee aan genoemde Staten die Partij zijn en geeft tevens aan of hij voornemens is zijn rechtsmacht uit te oefenen.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  De Staat die Partij is op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, is, in de gevallen waarop artikel 7 van toepassing is, indien hij deze persoon niet uitlevert, zonder enige uitzondering en ongeacht of het strafbare feit op zijn grondgebied is gepleegd of niet, verplicht de zaak zonder onnodige vertraging over te dragen aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten voor vervolging door middel van een procedure overeenkomstig het recht van die Staat. Deze autoriteiten nemen hun beslissing op dezelfde wijze als in geval van elk ander strafbaar feit van ernstige aard krachtens het recht van die Staat.   
2.  Wanneer het een Staat die Partij is op grond van zijn nationale wetgeving alleen is toegestaan een onderdaan uit te leveren of op andere wijze over te leveren op voorwaarde dat deze wordt teruggezonden naar die Staat om de straf te ondergaan die is opgelegd als gevolg van het proces of de procedure waarvoor de uitlevering of overgave van de persoon werd verzocht, en deze Staat en de Staat die verzoekt om uitlevering van de persoon instemmen met deze optie en andere voorwaarden die zij gepast achten, is een dergelijke voorwaardelijke uitlevering of overgave voldoende voor ontheffing van de in het eerste lid omschreven verplichting.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  Voordat dit Verdrag in werking treedt, worden de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten in alle tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bestaande uitleveringsverdragen geacht te zijn begrepen als uitleveringsdelicten. De Staten die Partij zijn verplichten zich ertoe bedoelde strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat vervolgens tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.  Indien een Staat die Partij is die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die Partij is waarmee hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan de aangezochte Staat die Partij is, indien hij dit verkiest, dit Verdrag beschouwen als een juridische grondslag voor uitlevering op grond van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten. De uitlevering is onderworpen aan de overige voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
3.  Staten die Partij zijn die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten onderling als uitleveringsdelicten, onderworpen aan de voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
4.  Voor uitlevering tussen Staten die Partij zijn worden de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, indien nodig, ten behoeve van uitlevering tussen Staten die Partij zijn, beschouwd als niet alleen begaan op de plaats waar zij zijn gepleegd, maar ook op het grondgebied van de Staten die hun rechtsmacht hebben gevestigd overeenkomstig artikel 7, eerste en tweede lid.   
5.  De bepalingen van alle uitleveringsverdragen en -regelingen die tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bestaan met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten omschreven in artikel 2, worden geacht tussen die Staten die Partij zijn te zijn gewijzigd voor zover zij niet verenigbaar zijn met dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  12  

1.  De Staten die Partij zijn verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke rechtshulp bij strafrechtelijke onderzoeken, bij strafzaken of bij uitleveringsprocedures op grond van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van rechtshulp ter verkrijging van bewijs in hun bezit dat nodig is voor het proces.   
2.  De Staten die Partij zijn kunnen een verzoek om wederzijdse rechtshulp niet weigeren op grond van het bankgeheim.   
3.  De verzoekende Partij stelt niet ter beschikking noch maakt gebruik van inlichtingen of bewijs, verschaft door de aangezochte Partij voor onderzoek, vervolging of procedures, die niet vermeld worden in het verzoek, zonder de voorafgaande toestemming van de aangezochte Partij.   
4.  Elke Staat die Partij is kan overwegen mechanismen in te stellen om andere Staten die Partij zijn deelgenoot te maken van inlichtingen of bewijs benodigd om straf-, civiel- of bestuursrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid vast te stellen uit hoofde van artikel 5.   
5.  De Staten die Partij zijn komen hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van het eerste en tweede lid na in overeenstemming met de verdragen en regelingen inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp of uitwisseling van inlichtingen die tussen hen bestaan. Indien dergelijke verdragen of regelingen ontbreken, verlenen de Staten die Partij zijn elkaar rechtshulp overeenkomstig hun nationale recht.   

### Artikel  13  

Geen van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten wordt, ten behoeve van uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp, beschouwd als een fiscaal delict. Dienovereenkomstig mogen Staten die Partij zijn geen verzoek om uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp weigeren met als enige reden dat het een fiscaal delict betreft.  

### Artikel  14  

Geen van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten wordt, ten behoeve van uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp, beschouwd als een politiek delict, een met een politiek delict samenhangend delict of een delict ingegeven door politieke motieven. Dienovereenkomstig mag een verzoek om uitlevering of wederzijdse rechtshulp op basis van een dergelijk delict niet worden geweigerd met als enige reden dat het een politiek delict, een met een politiek delict samenhangend delict of een delict ingegeven door politieke motieven betreft.  

### Artikel  15  

Niets in dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat het verplicht tot uitlevering of tot het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp in gevallen waarin de aangezochte Staat die Partij is ernstige redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat het verzoek tot uitlevering voor in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten of tot wederzijdse rechtshulp met betrekking tot dergelijke feiten is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te bestraffen op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, etnische afkomst of politieke overtuiging, of dat inwilliging van het verzoek de positie van betrokkene om een van deze redenen ongunstig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.  

### Artikel  16  

1.  Een persoon die in detentie zit of een straf ondergaat op het grondgebied van een Staat die Partij is, en om wiens aanwezigheid op het grondgebied van een andere Staat die Partij is wordt verzocht voor identificatie, een getuigenverklaring of voor het op andere wijze verlenen van medewerking ter verkrijging van bewijs voor onderzoek of vervolging inzake in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, mag worden overgebracht, indien wordt voldaan aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. de persoon geeft vrijwillig zijn of haar op volledige informatie gebaseerde toestemming;  

b. de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten stemmen ermee in overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die deze Staten gepast achten.     
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel: 

a. is de Staat waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht bevoegd en verplicht de overgebrachte persoon in detentie te houden, tenzij anderszins verzocht of gemachtigd door de Staat vanwaar de persoon is overgebracht;  

b. komt de Staat waarnaar de persoon is overgebracht onverwijld zijn verplichting na tot terugzending van de persoon voor detentie door de Staat vanwaar deze persoon is overgebracht, zoals vooraf overeengekomen, of op andere wijze overeengekomen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Staten;  

c. verlangt de Staat waarnaar de persoon wordt overgebracht niet van de Staat vanwaar de persoon is overgebracht dat deze een uitleveringsprocedure begint ten behoeve van de terugkeer van de persoon;  

d. krijgt de overgebrachte persoon vermindering van de in de Staat vanwaar hij of zij is overgebracht uit te zitten straf met de tijd in detentie doorgebracht in de Staat waarnaar hij of zij is overgebracht.     
3.  Tenzij de Staat die Partij is vanwaar een persoon overeenkomstig dit artikel moet worden overgebracht daarvoor toestemming geeft, wordt die persoon, ongeacht zijn of haar nationaliteit, niet vervolgd of in detentie gesteld, noch aan enige andere beperking van zijn of haar persoonlijke vrijheid onderworpen op het grondgebied van de Staat waarnaar deze persoon wordt overgebracht, wegens feiten of veroordelingen voorafgaand aan zijn of haar vertrek uit het grondgebied van de Staat vanwaar deze persoon werd overgebracht.   

### Artikel  17  

Een ieder die in detentie wordt gesteld of tegen wie andere maatregelen worden getroffen of een proces aanhangig wordt gemaakt op grond van dit Verdrag, heeft recht op een eerlijke behandeling, met inbegrip van het genot van alle rechten en waarborgen in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van de Staat op wiens grondgebied die persoon zich bevindt en de toepasselijke bepalingen van het internationaal recht, met inbegrip van die bepalingen die betrekking hebben op de rechten van de mens.  

### Artikel  18  

De Staten die Partij zijn werken samen ter voorkoming van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten door alle uitvoerbare maatregelen te nemen, onder meer door aanpassing van hun nationale recht, zo nodig, ter voorkoming en verijdeling van voorbereidingen op hun respectieve grondgebieden die zijn gericht op het plegen, al dan niet op hun grondgebied, van deze strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van: 

a. maatregelen tot het op hun grondgebied verbieden van illegale activiteiten van personen en organisaties die het plegen van in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten bewust aanmoedigen, uitlokken, organiseren of daaraan deelnemen;  

b. maatregelen die aan financiële instellingen en andere bij financiële transacties betrokken beroepsgroepen de eis stellen dat deze de meest doeltreffende maatregelen gebruiken die beschikbaar zijn voor het identificeren van hun vaste of incidentele klanten alsmede klanten in wier belang rekeningen worden geopend, en bijzondere aandacht schenken aan ongebruikelijke of verdachte transacties en transacties melden waarvan vermoed wordt dat zij afkomstig zijn van criminele activiteiten. Voor dit doel overwegen de Partijen: 

i. regels aan te nemen die het openen van rekeningen verbieden waarvan de houders of begunstigden niet geïdentificeerd of niet identificeerbaar zijn, en maatregelen te treffen die verzekeren dat dergelijke instellingen de identiteit van de werkelijke belanghebbenden bij dergelijke transacties verifiëren;  

ii. ten aanzien van het identificeren van rechtspersonen de eis te stellen dat financiële instellingen, zo nodig, maatregelen nemen om het juridisch bestaan en de structuur van de klant te verifiëren door, hetzij van een openbaar register of van de klant of van beide, bewijs te verkrijgen omtrent de oprichting, waaronder gegevens betreffende de naam, rechtsvorm, adres, bestuurders en bepalingen inzake de bevoegdheid om de rechtspersoon te binden;  

iii. regels aan te nemen die financiële instellingen de verplichting opleggen terstond aan de bevoegde autoriteiten alle ingewikkelde, ongebruikelijke grote transacties en ongebruikelijke transactiepatronen te melden die geen duidelijk economisch of kennelijk rechtmatig doel hebben, zonder dat zij hoeven vrezen dat zij strafrechtelijke of civiele aansprakelijkheid aanvaarden wegens overtreding van enige beperking inzake bekendmaking van informatie, indien zij hun verdenkingen te goeder trouw melden;  

iv. aan financiële instellingen de eis te stellen dat zij, gedurende ten minste vijf jaren, alle noodzakelijke documenten over zowel binnenlandse als internationale transacties bewaren.      
2.  De Staten die Partij zijn werken voorts samen bij het voorkomen van in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten door te overwegen: 

a. maatregelen voor het toezicht, met inbegrip van bijvoorbeeld het verlenen van vergunningen, op alle bij geldverkeer betrokken instellingen;  

b. uitvoerbare maatregelen voor het opsporen of volgen van het feitelijk over de grens vervoeren van contant geld en door de houder verhandelbare stukken, mits zij zijn omkleed met strikte waarborgen die een juist gebruik van inlichtingen verzekeren en mits zij niet in enig opzicht het vrije kapitaalverkeer hinderen.     
3.  De Staten die Partij zijn werken voorts samen bij het voorkomen van de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten door het uitwisselen van nauwkeurige en gecontroleerde inlichtingen in overeenstemming met hun nationale recht en het coördineren van bestuursrechtelijke en andere maatregelen die, waar nodig, worden genomen ter voorkoming van het plegen van in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, met name door: 

a. het opzetten en onderhouden van communicatiekanalen tussen hun bevoegde instanties en diensten ter vergemakkelijking van de veilige en snelle uitwisseling van inlichtingen betreffende alle aspecten van in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten;  

b. het met elkaar samenwerken bij het uitvoeren van onderzoeken, inzake de in artikel 2 omschreven strafbare feiten, betreffende: 

i. de identiteit, verblijfplaats en activiteiten van personen ten aanzien van wie een redelijk vermoeden bestaat dat zij bij dergelijke strafbare feiten betrokken zijn;  

ii. het verkeer van fondsen met betrekking tot het plegen van dergelijke strafbare feiten.
