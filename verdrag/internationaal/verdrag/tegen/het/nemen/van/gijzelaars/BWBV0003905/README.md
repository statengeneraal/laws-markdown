####International Convention against the Taking of Hostages

The States Parties to this Convention, Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of friendly relations and co-operation among States, Recognizing in particular that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights, Reaffirming the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, Considering that the taking of hostages is an offence of grave concern to the international community and that, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, any person committing an act of hostage taking shall either be prosecuted or extradited, Being convinced that it is urgently necessary to develop international co-operation between States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention, prosecution and punishment of all acts of taking of hostages as manifestations of international terrorism,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

1.  Any person who seizes or detains and treatens to kill, to injure or to continue to detain another person (hereinafter referred to as the “hostage”) in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, an international intergovernmental organization, a natural or juridical person, or a group of persons, to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the offence of taking of hostages (“hostage-taking”) within the meaning of this Convention.   
2.  Any person who: 

(a) attempts to commit an act of hostage-taking, or  

(b) participates as an accomplice of anyone who commits or attempts to commit an act of hostage-taking likewise commits an offence for the purposes of this Convention.     

### Article  2  

Each State Party shall make the offences set forth in article 1 punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of those offences.  

### Article  3  

1.  The State Party in the territory of which the hostage is held by the offender shall take all measures it considers appropriate to ease the situation of the hostage, in particular, to secure his release and, after his release, to facilitate, when relevant, his departure.   
2.  If any object which the offender has obtained as a result of the taking of hostages comes into the custody of a State Party, that State Party shall return it as soon as possible to the hostage or the third party referred to in article 1, as the case may be, or to the appropriate authorities thereof.   

### Article  4  

States Parties shall co-operate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 1, particularly by: 

(a) taking all practicable measures to prevent preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories, including measures to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations that encourage, instigate, organize or engage in the perpetration of acts of taking of hostages;  

(b) exchanging information and co-ordinating the taking of administrative and other measures as appropriate to prevent the commission of those offences.    

### Article  5  

1.  Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over any of the offences set forth in article 1 which are committed: 

(a) in its territory or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;  

(b) by any of its nationals or, if that State considers it appropriate, by those stateless persons who have their habitual residence in its territory;  

(c) in order to compel that State to do or abstain from doing any act; or  

(d) with respect to a hostage who is a national of that State, if that State considers it appropriate.     
2.  Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 1 in cases where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him to any of the States mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article.   
3.  This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law.   

### Article  6  

1.  Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall, in accordance with its laws, take him into custody or take other measures to ensure his presence for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted. That State Party shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts.   
2.  The custody or other measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be notified without delay directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations to: 

(a) the State where the offence was committed;  

(b) the State against which compulsion has been directed or attempted;  

(c) the State of which the natural or juridical person against whom compulsion has been directed or attempted is a national;  

(d) the State of which the hostage is a national or in the territory of which he has his habitual residence;  

(e) the State of which the alleged offender is a national or, if he is a stateless person, in the territory of which he has his habitual residence;  

(f) the international intergovernmental organization against which compulsion has been directed or attempted;  

(g) all other States concerned.     
3.  Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are being taken shall be entitled: 

(a) to communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national or which is otherwise entitled to establish such communication or, if he is a stateless person, the State in the territory of which he has his habitual residence;  

(b) to be visited by a representative of that State.     
4.  The rights referred to in paragraph 3 of this article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the State in the territory of which the alleged offender is present subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under paragraph 3 of this article are intended.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to the right of any State Party having a claim to jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 (b) of article 5 to invite the International Committee of the Red Cross to communicate with and visit the alleged offender.   
6.  The State which makes the preliminary inquiry contemplated in paragraph 1 of this article shall promptly report its findings to the States or organization referred to in paragraph 2 of this article and indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.   

### Article  7  

The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall in accordance with its laws communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit the information to the other States concerned and the international intergovernmental organizations concerned.  

### Article  8  

1.  The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is found shall, if it does not extradite him, be obliged, without exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a grave nature under the law of that State.   
2.  Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connexion with any of the offences set forth in article 1 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the law of the State in the territory of which he is present.   

### Article  9  

1.  A request for the extradition of an alleged offender, pursuant to this Convention, shall not be granted if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing: 

(a) that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 1 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion; or  

(b) that the person's position may be prejudiced: 

(i) for any of the reasons mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, or  

(ii) for the reason that communication with him by the appropriate authorities of the State entitled to exercise rights of protection cannot be effected.       
2.  With respect to the offences as defined in this Convention, the provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements applicable between States Parties are modified as between States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention.   

### Article  10  

1.  The offences set forth in article 1 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.   
2.  If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested State may at its option consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 1. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State.   
3.  States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 1 as extraditable offences between themselves subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State.   
4.  The offences set forth in article 1 shall be treated, for the purpose of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territories of the States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 5.   

### Article  11  

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connexion with criminal proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 1, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings.   
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not affect obligations concerning mutual judicial assistance embodied in any other treaty.   

### Article  12  

In so far as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 for the protection of war victims or the Additional Protocols to those Conventions are applicable to a particular act of hostage-taking, and in so far as States Parties to this Convention are bound under those conventions to prosecute or hand over the hostage-taker, the present Convention shall not apply to an act of hostage-taking committed in the course of armed conflicts as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Protocols thereto, including armed conflicts mentioned in article 1, paragraph 4, of Additional Protocol I of 1977, in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.  

### Article  13  

This Convention shall not apply where the offence is committed within a single State, the hostage and the alleged offender are nationals of that State and the alleged offender is found in the territory of that State.  

### Article  14  

Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as justifying the violation of the territorial integrity or political independence of a State in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations.  

### Article  15  

The provisions of this Convention shall not affect the application of the Treaties on Asylum, in force at the date of the adoption of this Convention, as between the States which are parties to those Treaties; but a State Party to this Convention may not invoke those Treaties with respect to another State Party to this Convention which is not a party to those treaties.  

### Article  16  

1.  Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which is not settled by negotiation shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If within six months from the date of the request for arbitration the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice by request in conformity with the Statute of the Court.   
2.  Each State may at the time of signature or ratification of this Convention or accession thereto declare that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1 of this article. The other States Parties shall not be bound by paragraph 1 of this article with respect to any State Party which has made such a reservation.   
3.  Any State Party which has made a reservation in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article may at any time withdraw that reservation by notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   

### Article  17  

1.  This Convention is open for signature by all States until 31 December 1980 at United Nations Headquarters in New York.

####Internationaal Verdrag tegen het nemen van gijzelaars

De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, Indachtig de doelstellingen en beginselen, vervat in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties, betreffende de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid en de bevordering van vriendschappelijke betrekkingen en samenwerking tussen Staten, In het bijzonder erkennende dat een ieder recht heeft op leven, vrijheid en veiligheid van zijn persoon, zoals vermeld in de Universele Verklaring van de rechten van de mens en het Internationaal Verdrag inzake burgerrechten en politieke rechten, Opnieuw bevestigende het beginsel van gelijke rechten en zelfbeschikking der volken, zoals vastgelegd in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en de Verklaring inzake de beginselen van het volkenrecht betreffende vriendschappelijke betrekkingen en samenwerking tussen de Staten overeenkomstig het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties, alsmede in andere daarop betrekking hebbende resoluties van de Algemene Vergadering, Overwegende dat het nemen van gijzelaars een misdaad is dat de internationale gemeenschap met diepe zorg vervult, en dat een ieder die een gijzelingshandeling pleegt overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit Verdrag hetzij dient te worden vervolgd, hetzij dient te worden uitgeleverd, Ervan overtuigd dat het dringend noodzakelijk is internationale samenwerking tussen Staten te ontwikkelen bij het ontwerpen en aannemen van doeltreffende maatregelen ter voorkoming, vervolging en bestraffing van alle gijzelingshandelingen als uitingen van internationaal terrorisme,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  1  

1.  Een ieder die een andere persoon (hierna te noemen de „gijzelaar”) overmeestert of van zijn vrijheid berooft en dreigt te doden, te verwonden of van zijn vrijheid beroofd te houden teneinde een derde, te weten een Staat, een internationale intergouvernementele organisatie, een natuurlijke persoon of een rechtspersoon, dan wel een groep personen, te dwingen een handeling te verrichten of zich te onthouden van het verrichten daarvan als al dan niet uitdrukkelijke voorwaarde voor de vrijlating van de gijzelaar, pleegt het misdrijf van gijzeling in de zin van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Een ieder die: 

(a) een poging doet tot het plegen van een gijzelingshandeling of  

(b) daaraan deelneemt als medeplichtige of medepleger van iemand die een gijzelingshandeling pleegt of een poging daartoe doet, begaat voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag eveneens een strafbaar feit.     

### Artikel  2  

Iedere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag stelt de in artikel 1 vermelde feiten strafbaar met passende straffen, rekening houdend met het ernstige karakter van deze feiten.  

### Artikel  3  

1.  De Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en op wiens grondgebied de gijzelaar door de dader wordt vastgehouden, neemt alle maatregelen die hij passend acht om de toestand van de gijzelaar te verlichten, in het bijzonder om zijn vrijlating te verzekeren, en na zijn vrijlating, in voorkomend geval, zijn vertrek te vergemakkelijken.   
2.  Indien een voorwerp dat de dader als gevolg van de gijzeling heeft verkregen in het bezit geraakt van een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag, geeft die Staat dat voorwerp zo spoedig mogelijk terug aan de gijzelaar of de in artikel 1 bedoelde derde, naar gelang het geval, dan wel aan de in aanmerking komende autoriteiten van die derde.   

### Artikel  4  

De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag werken samen ter voorkoming van de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten, in het bijzonder door: 

(a) alle praktisch uitvoerbare maatregelen te nemen om te voorkomen dat op hun onderscheiden grondgebieden voorbereidingen worden getroffen voor het begaan van die strafbare feiten binnen of buiten hun grondgebied, met inbegrip van maatregelen om te verbieden dat op hun grondgebied onwettige activiteiten plaatsvinden door personen, groepen of organisaties die aanmoedigen of aanzetten tot het verrichten van gijzelingshandelingen, deze organiseren of deze uitvoeren;  

(b) inlichtingen uit te wisselen en administratieve en andere maatregelen, naar gelang het geval, ter voorkoming van het begaan van deze strafbare feiten te coördineren.    

### Artikel  5  

1.  Iedere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag neemt de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn bevoegdheid vast te leggen tot kennisneming van de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten die worden begaan: 

(a) op zijn grondgebied of aan boord van vaartuigen luchtvaartuigen, ingeschreven in die Staat;  

(b) door zijn onderdanen of, indien die Staat dat gewenst acht, door staatlozen die hun vaste verblijfplaats op zijn grondgebied hebben;  

(c) met het oogmerk die Staat te dwingen een handeling te verrichten of zich te onthouden van het verrichten daarvan; of  

(d) met betrekking tot een gijzelaar die onderdaan van die Staat is, indien die Staat dat gewenst acht.     
2.  Evenzo neemt iedere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag de maatregelen die nodig zijn om zijn bevoegdheid tot kennisneming vast te leggen ten aanzien van de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten in de gevallen waarin de vermoedelijke dader zich op zijn grondgebied bevindt en die Staat hem niet aan een van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel vermelde Staten uitlevert.   
3.  Dit Verdrag sluit geen enkele bevoegdheid in strafzaken uit, die wordt uitgeoefend krachtens de nationale wet.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  Iedere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, neemt deze indien hij ervan overtuigd is dat de omstandigheden zulks wettigen overeenkomstig zijn wetten in hechtenis of neemt andere maatregelen om zijn aanwezigheid te verzekeren gedurende de tijd die nodig is om een strafrechtelijke procedure of een uitleveringsprocedure tegen hem te kunnen aanvangen. Die Staat stelt onmiddellijk een vooronderzoek naar de feiten in.   
2.  De voorlopige hechtenis of de andere in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen worden onverwijld, rechtstreeks of door tussenkomst van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, ter kennis gebracht van: 

(a) de Staat waar het strafbare feit werd gepleegd;  

(b) de Staat tegen wie de dwang of de poging daartoe was gericht;  

(c) de Staat waarvan, onderscheidenlijk waar, de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon tegen welke de dwang of de poging daartoe was gericht onderdaan is, onderscheidenlijk is gevestigd;  

(d) de Staat waarvan de gijzelaar onderdaan is of op wiens grondgebied deze zijn vaste verblijfplaats heeft;  

(e) de Staat waarvan de vermoedelijke dader onderdaan is of, indien deze staatloos is, de Staat op wiens grondgebied deze zijn vaste verblijfplaats heeft;  

(f) de internationale intergouvernementele organisatie tegen welke de dwang of de poging daartoe was gericht;  

(g) alle andere betrokken Staten.     
3.  Iedere persoon ten aanzien van wie de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde maatregelen worden genomen, heeft het recht: 

(a) onverwijld in contact te treden met de dichtstbijzijnde bevoegde vertegenwoordiger van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is of die anderszins is gerechtigd een zodanig contact te onderhouden of, indien hij staatloos is, van de Staat op wiens grondgebied hij zijn vaste verblijfplaats heeft;  

(b) te worden bezocht door een vertegenwoordiger van die Staat.     
4.  De in het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde rechten worden uitgeoefend overeenkomstig de wetten en voorschriften van de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader zich bevindt, mits de genoemde wetten en voorschriften het evenwel mogelijk maken dat de doeleinden met het oog waarop de in het derde lid van dit artikel vervatte rechten zijn verleend, volledig worden verwezenlijkt.   
5.  Het bepaalde in het derde en vierde lid van dit artikel laat het recht van iedere staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en die aanspraak maakt op bevoegdheid overeenkomstig artikel 5, eerste lid, letter b, onverlet om het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis uit te nodigen met de vermoedelijke dader in contact te treden en deze te bezoeken.   
6.  De Staat die het in het eerste lid van dit artikel voorziene vooronderzoek naar de feiten instelt, bericht zijn conclusies terstond aan de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde Staten of organisatie en geeft aan of hij voornemens is zijn rechtsmacht uit te oefenen.   

### Artikel  7  

De Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en waar de vermoedelijke dader wordt vervolgd, brengt, overeenkomstig zijn wetten, het eindresultaat van de strafzaak ter kennis van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die de gegevens doorzendt aan de andere betrokken Staten en aan de betrokken internationale intergouvernementele organisaties.  

### Artikel  8  

1.  De Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader wordt aangetroffen, is, indien hij deze niet uitlevert, in alle gevallen en ongeacht of het strafbare feit al of niet binnen zijn grondgebied werd begaan, verplicht de zaak voor vervolging aan zijn bevoegde autoriteiten over te dragen, volgens de in zijn wetten voorziene procedures. Deze autoriteiten nemen hun besluit op dezelfde wijze als in het geval van een gewoon strafbaar feit van ernstige aard naar de wet van die Staat.   
2.  Aan een ieder tegen wie een strafzaak loopt in verband met een van de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten wordt een eerlijke behandeling gewaarborgd in alle stadia van de procedure, met inbegrip van alle rechten en waarborgen die worden verleend door de wet van de Staat op het grondgebied waarvan hij zich bevindt.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  Een verzoek om uitlevering van een vermoedelijke dader ingevolge dit Verdrag wordt niet ingewilligd indien de aangezochte Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag ernstige redenen heeft om aan te nemen: 

(a) dat het verzoek om uitlevering voor een in artikel 1 vermeld strafbaar feit is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te straffen op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, ethnische afkomst of politieke gezindheid; of  

(b) dat de positie van die persoon ongunstig dreigt te worden beïnvloed: 

(i) op grond van een van de in letter (a) van dit lid vermelde redenen, of  

(ii) omdat geen contact tussen hem en de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staat die gerechtigd is rechten van bescherming uit te oefenen, kan plaatsvinden.       
2.  Met betrekking tot de strafbare feiten, als omschreven in dit Verdrag, worden de bepalingen in alle uitleveringsverdragen en -regelingen, van toepassing tussen de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, tussen die Staten gewijzigd voor zover deze onverenigbaar zijn met dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  10  

1.  De in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten worden geacht in ieder tussen de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag bestaand uitleveringsverdrag te zijn begrepen als uitleveringsdelicten. De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag verplichten zich ertoe die strafbare feiten op te nemen als uitleveringsdelicten in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.  Indien een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag, maar waarmede hij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft gesloten, kan de aangezochte Staat, indien hij dat verkiest, dit Verdrag beschouwen als de wettelijke basis voor uitlevering wegens de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten. Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de andere voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
3.  De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen onderling de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten als uitleveringsdelicten, onderworpen aan de voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Staat voorziet.   
4.  Voor uitlevering tussen de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag worden de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten beschouwd als niet alleen begaan op de plaats waar zij zijn gepleegd, maar ook op het grondgebied van de Staten die overeenkomstig het eerste lid van artikel 5 hun bevoegdheid dienen vast te leggen.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke rechtshulp in strafzaken wegens de in artikel 1 vermelde strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van het verschaffen van al het hun ter beschikking staande bewijsmateriaal dat nodig is in verband met de vervolging.   
2.  Het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel laat verplichtingen betreffende wederzijdse rechtshulp, vervat in andere verdragen, onverlet.   

### Artikel  12  

Voor zover de Verdragen van Genève van 1949 inzake de bescherming van oorlogsslachtoffers of de Aanvullende Protocollen bij deze Verdragen van toepassing zijn op een bepaalde gijzelingshandeling en voor zover de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag krachtens deze Verdragen zijn gehouden degene die zich schuldig heeft gemaakt aan bedoelde gijzelingshandeling, te vervolgen of over te dragen, is dit Verdrag niet van toepassing op een gijzelingshandeling die is gepleegd tijdens gewapende conflicten - als omschreven in de Verdragen van Genève van 1949 en de Protocollen daarbij, met inbegrip van gewapende conflicten, vermeld in Protocol I van 1977, artikel 1, vierde lid - waarin volkeren vechten tegen koloniale overheersing en vreemde bezetting en tegen racistische regimes in de uitoefening van hun recht op zelfbeschikking zoals neergelegd in het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en de Verklaring inzake de beginselen van het volkenrecht betreffende vriendschappelijke betrekkingen en samenwerking tussen Staten overeenkomstig het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  13  

Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing wanneer het strafbare feit is begaan binnen één enkele Staat, de gijzelaar en de vermoedelijke dader onderdaan van die Staat zijn en de vermoedelijke dader op het grondgebied van die Staat wordt aangetroffen.  

### Artikel  14  

Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag mag worden uitgelegd als rechtvaardiging van de schending van de territoriale integriteit of politieke onafhankelijkheid van een Staat in strijd met het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  15  

Het bepaalde in dit Verdrag laat de toepassing van de verdragen inzake asiel die van kracht zijn op de datum waarop dit Verdrag is aangenomen, onverlet tussen de Staten die partij zijn bij die verdragen; een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag kan zich echter niet op die verdragen beroepen ten aanzien van een andere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag maar niet bij die verdragen.  

### Artikel  16  

1.  Elk geschil tussen twee of meer Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag inzake de uitleg of toepassing van dit Verdrag, dat niet wordt beslecht door onderhandelingen, wordt op verzoek van een van die Staten onderworpen aan arbitrage. Indien de partijen er binnen zes maanden na de datum van het verzoek tot arbitrage niet in zijn geslaagd overeenstemming te bereiken over de vorm van deze arbitrage, kan een van die partijen het geschil voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof door middel van een verzoek overeenkomstig het Statuut van het Hof.   
2.  Iedere Staat kan op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag of van toetreding daartoe verklaren zich niet gebonden te achten door het eerste lid van dit artikel. De andere Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag zijn niet gebonden door het eerste lid van dit artikel tegenover een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en die een zodanig voorbehoud heeft gemaakt.   
3.  Een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en die een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel kan dit voorbehoud te allen tijde intrekken door middel van een kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  17  

1.  Dit Verdrag staat tot 31 december 1980 open voor ondertekening door alle Staten op de Zetel van de Verenigde Naties te New York.   
2.  Dit Verdrag dient te worden bekrachtigd. De akten van bekrachtiging dienen te worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   
3.  Dit Verdrag staat open voor toetreding door iedere Staat. De akten van toetreding dienen te worden nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  18  

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking op de dertigste dag volgende op de datum van nederlegging van de tweeëntwintigste akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   
2.  Voor iedere Staat die dit Verdrag bekrachtigt of daartoe toetreedt na de nederlegging van de tweeëntwintigste akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding treedt het Verdrag in werking op de dertigste dag na de nederlegging door die Staat van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  Iedere Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag kan dit opzeggen door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.   
2.  De opzegging wordt van kracht één jaar na de datum waarop de kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties is ontvangen.
