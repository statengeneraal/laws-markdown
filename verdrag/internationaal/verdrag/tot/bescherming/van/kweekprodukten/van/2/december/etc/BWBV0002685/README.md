### CHAPTER  III  

####CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANT OF THE BREEDER'S RIGHT

### Article  5  

####Conditions of Protection

1.  [Criteria to be satisfied] The breeder's right shall be granted where the variety is 

(i) new,  

(ii) distinct,  

(ii) uniform and  

(iv) stable.     
2.  [Other conditions] The grant of the breeder's right shall not be subject to any further or different conditions, provided that the variety is designated by a denomination in accordance with the provisions of Article 20, that the applicant complies with the formalities provided for by the law of the Contracting Party with whose authority the application has been filed and that he pays the required fees.   

### Article  6  

####Novelty

1.  [Criteria] The variety shall be deemed to be new if, at the date of filing of the application for a breeder's right, propagating or harvested material of the variety has not been sold or otherwise disposed of to others, by or with the consent, of the breeder, for purposes of exploitation of the variety 

(i) in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the application has been filed earlier than one year before that date and  

(ii) in a territory other than that of the Contracting Party in which the application has been filed earlier than four years or, in the case of trees or of vines, earlier than six years before the said date.     
2.  [Varieties of recent creation] Where a Contracting Party applies this Convention to a plant genus or species to which it did not previously apply this Convention or an earlier Act, it may consider a variety of recent creation existing at the date of such extension of protection to satisfy the condition of novelty defined in paragraph (1) even where the sale or disposal to others described in that paragraph took place earlier than the time limits defined in that paragraph.   
3.  ["Territory" in certain cases] For the purposes of paragraph (1), all the Contracting Parties which are member States of one and the same intergovernmental organization may act jointly, where the regulations of that organization so require, to assimilate acts done on the territories of the States members of that organization to acts done on their own territories and, should they do so, shall notify the Secretary-General accordingly.   

### Article  7  

####Distinctness

The variety shall be deemed to be distinct if it is clearly distinguishable from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time of the filing of the application. In particular, the filing of an application for the granting of a breeder's right or for the entering of another variety in an official register of varieties, in any country, shall be deemed to render that other variety a matter of common knowledge from the date of the application, provided that the application leads to the granting of a breeder's right or to the entering of the said other variety in the official register of varieties, as the case may be.  

### Article  8  

####Uniformity

The variety shall be deemed to be uniform if, subject to the variation that may be expected from the particular features of its propagation, it is sufficiently uniform in its relevant characteristics.  

### Article  9  

####Stability

The variety shall be deemed to be stable if its relevant characteristics remain unchanged after repeated propagation or, in the case of a particular cycle of propagation, at the end of each such cycle.  

### CHAPTER  IV  

####APPLICATION FOR THE GRANT OF THE BREEDER'S RIGHT

### Article  10  

####Filing of Applications

1.  [Place of first application] The breeder may choose the Contracting Party with whose authority he wishes to file his first application for a breeder's right.   
2.  [Time of subsequent application] The breeder may apply to the authorities of other Contracting Parties for the grant of breeders' rights without waiting for the grant to him of a breeder's right by the authority of the Contracting Party with which the first application was filed.   
3.  [Independence of protection) No Contracting Party shall refuse to grant a breeder's right or limit its duration on the ground that protection for the same variety has not been applied for, has been refused or has expired in any other State or intergovernmental organization.   

### Article  11  

####Right of Priority

1.  [The right; its period] Any breeder who has duly filed an application for the protection of a variety in one of the Contracting Parties (the "first application") shall, for the purpose of filing an application for the grant of a breeder's right for the same variety with the authority of any other Contracting Party (the "subsequent application"), enjoy a right of priority for a period of twelve months. This period shall be computed from the date of filing of the first application. The day of filing shall not be included in the latter period.   
2.  [Claiming the right] In order to benefit from the right of priority, the breeder shall, in the subsequent application, claim the priority of the first application. The authority with which the subsequent application has been filed may require the breeder to furnish, within a period of not less than three months from the filing date of the subsequent application, a copy of the documents which constitute the first application, certified to be a true copy by the authority with which that application was filed, and samples or other evidence that the variety which is the subject matter of both applications is the same.   
3.  [Documents and material] The breeder shall be allowed a period of two years after the expiration of the period of priority or, where the first application is rejected or withdrawn, an appropriate time after such rejection or withdrawal, in which to furnish, to the authority of the Contracting Party with which he has filed the subsequent application, any necessary information, document or material required for the purpose of the examination under Article 12, as required by the laws of that Contracting Party.   
4.  [Events occurring during the period] Events occurring within the period provided for in paragraph (1), such as the filing of another application or the publication or use of the variety that is the subject of the first application, shall not constitute a ground for rejecting the subsequent application. Such events shall also not give rise to any third-party right.   

### Article  12  

####Examination of the Application

Any decision to grant a breeder's right shall require an examination for compliance with the conditions under Articles 5 to 9. In the course of the examination, the authority may grow the variety or carry out other necessary tests, cause the growing of the variety or the carrying out of other necessary tests, or take into account the results of growing tests or other trials which have already been carried out. For the purposes of examination, the authority may require the breeder to furnish all the necessary information, documents or material.  

### Article  13  

####Provisional Protection

Each Contracting Party shall provide measures designed to safeguard the interests of the breeder during the period between the filing or the publication of the application for the grant of a breeder's right and the grant of that right. Such measures shall have the effect that the holder of a breeder's right shall at least be entitled to equitable remuneration from any person who, during the said period, has carried out acts which, once the right is granted, require the breeder's authorization as provided in Article 14. A Contracting Party may provide that the said measures shall only take effect in relation to persons whom the breeder has notified of the filing of the application.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####THE RIGHTS OF THE BREEDER

### Article  14  

####Scope of the Breeder's Right

(iii) varieties whose production requires the repeated use of the protected variety.    

b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a)(i), a variety shall be deemed to be essentially derived from another variety ("the initial variety") when 

(i) it is predominantly derived from the initial variety, or from a variety that is itself predominantly derived from the initial variety, while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety,  

(ii) it is clearly distinguishable from the initial variety and  

(iii) except for the differences which result from the act of derivation, it conforms to the initial variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety.    

c) Essentially derived varieties may be obtained for example by the selection of a natural or induced mutant, or of a somaclonal variant, the selection of a variant individual from plants of the initial variety, backcrossing, or transformation by genetic engineering.

[Exhaustion of right] The breeder's right shall not extend to acts concerning any material, of the protected variety, or of a variety covered by the provisions of Article 14(5), which has been sold or otherwise marketed by the breeder or with his consent in the territory of the Contracting Party concerned, or any material derived from the said material, unless such acts 

(i) involve further propagation of the variety in question or  

(ii) involve an export of material of the variety, which enables the propagation of the variety, into a country which does not protect varieties of the plant genus or species to which the variety belongs, except where the exported material is for final consumption purposes.     
2.  [Meaning of "material"] For the purposes of paragraph (1), "material" means, in relation to a variety, 

(i) propagating material of any kind,  

(ii) harvested material, including entire plants and parts of plants, and  

(iii) any product made directly from the harvested material.     
3.  ["Territory" in certain cases] For the purposes of paragraph (1), all, the Contracting Parties which are member States of one and the same intergovernmental organization may act jointly, where the regulations of that organization so require, to assimilate acts done on the territories of the States members of that organization to acts done on their own territories and, should they do so, shall notify the Secretary-General accordingly.   

### Article  17

### Article  18  

####Measures Regulating Commerce

The breeder's right shall be independent of any measure taken by a Contracting Party to regulate within its territory the production, certification and marketing of material of varieties or the importing or exporting of such material. In any case, such measures shall not affect the application of the provisions of this Convention.

### CHAPTER  VI  

####VARIETY DENOMINATION

### Article  20  

####Variety Denomination

1.  [Designation of varieties by denominations; use of the denomination] 

a) The variety shall be designated by a denomination which will be its generic designation.  

b) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that, subject to paragraph (4), no rights in the designation registered as the denomination of the variety shall hamper the free use of the denomination, in connection with the variety, even after the expiration of the breeder's right.     
2.  [Characteristics of the denomination] The denomination must enable the variety to be identified. It may not consist solely of figures except where this is an established practice for designating varieties. It must not be liable to mislead or to cause confusion concerning the characteristics, value or identity of the variety or the identity of the breeder. In particular, it must be different from every denomination which designates, in the territory of any Contracting Party, an existing variety of the same plant species or of a closely related species.   
3.  [Registration of the denomination] The denomination of the variety shall be submitted by the breeder to the authority. If it is found that the denomination does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (2), the authority shall refuse to register it and shall require the breeder to propose another denomination within a prescribed period. The denomination shall be registered by the authority at the same time as the breeder's right is granted.   
4.  [Prior rights of third persons] Prior rights of third persons shall not be affected. If, by reason of a prior right, the use of the denomination of a variety is forbidden to a person who, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (7), is obliged to use it, the authority shall require the breeder to submit another denomination for the variety.   
5.  [Same denomination in all Contracting Parties] A variety must be submitted to all Contracting Parties under the same denomination. The authority of each Contracting Party shall register the denomination so submitted, unless it considers the denomination unsuitable within its territory. In the latter case it shall require the breeder to submit another denomination.   
6.  [Information among the authorities of Contracting Parties] The authority of a Contracting Party shall ensure that the authorities of all the other Contracting Parties are informed of matters concerning variety denominations, in particular the submission, registration and cancellation of denominations. Any authority may address its observations, if any, on the registration of a denomination to the authority which communicated that denomination.   
7.  [Obligation to use the denomination] Any person who, within the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, offers for sale or markets propagating material of a variety protected within the said territory shall be obliged to use the denomination of that variety, even after the expiration of the breeder's right in that variety, except where, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4), prior rights prevent such use.   
8.  [Indications used in association with denominations] When a variety is offered for sale or marketed, it shall be permitted to associate a trade mark, trade name or other similar indication with a registered variety denomination. If such, an indication is so associated, the denomination must nevertheless be easily recognizable.   

### CHAPTER  VII  

####NULLITY AND CANCELLATION OF THE BREEDER'S RIGHT

### Article  21  

####Nullity of the Breeder's Right

1.  [Reasons of nullity] Each Contracting Party shall declare a breeder's right granted by it null and void when it is established

(iii) that the breeder's right has been granted to a person who is not entitled to it, unless it is transferred to the person who is so entitled.     
2.  [Exclusion of other reasons) No breeder's right shall be declared null and void for reasons other than those referred to in paragraph (1).   

### Article  22  

####Cancellation of the Breeder's Right

1.  [Reasons for cancellation] 

a) Each Contracting Party may cancel a breeder's right granted by it if it is established that the conditions laid down in Articles 8 or 9 are no longer fulfilled.  

b) Furthermore, each Contracting Party may cancel a breeder's right granted by it if, after being requested to do so and within a prescribed period, 

(i) the breeder does not provide the authority with the information, documents or material deemed necessary for verifying the maintenance of the variety,  

(ii) the breeder fails to pay such fees as may be payable to keep his right in force, or  

(iii) the breeder does not propose, where the denomination of the variety is cancelled after the grant of the right, another suitable denomination.

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####VOORWAARDEN VOOR HET VERLENEN VAN HET KWEKERSRECHT

### Artikel  5  

####Voorwaarden voor bescherming

1.  [Criteria waaraan dient te worden voldaan] Het kwekersrecht wordt verleend wanneer het ras 

i. nieuw,  

ii. onderscheidbaar,  

iii. homogeen en  

iv. bestendig    is.  
2.  [Andere voorwaarden] Het verlenen van het kwekersrecht mag niet afhankelijk worden gesteld van aanvullende of afwijkende voorwaarden, mits het ras wordt aangeduid door een benaming in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel 20, de aanvrager de formaliteiten vervult die zijn bepaald in de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Partij bij de dienst waarvan de aanvraag is ingediend en hij de vereiste rechten heeft betaald.   

### Artikel  6  

####Nieuwheid

1.  [Criteria] Het ras wordt als nieuw aangemerkt indien op de datum van indiening van de aanvraag om kwekersrecht geen teeltmateriaal of geoogst materiaal van het ras is verkocht of anderszins ter beschikking is gesteld aan derden, door of met toestemming van de kweker, met het oog op de exploitatie van het ras 

i. op het grondgebied van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar de aanvraag is ingediend, zulks niet langer geleden dan een jaar vóór die datum, en  

ii. op een ander grondgebied dan dat van de Verdragsluitende Partij waar de aanvraag is ingediend, zulks hetzij niet langer geleden dan vier jaar, hetzij, in het geval van bomen of wijnstokken, niet langer geleden dan zes jaar vóór bedoelde datum.     
2.  [Recentelijk gekweekte rassen] Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Partij dit Verdrag toepast op een plantengeslacht of een plantesoort waarop zij dit Verdrag of een eerdere Akte voorheen niet toepaste, mag zij een recentelijk ontstaan ras dat bestaat op de datum van uitbreiding van de bescherming, beschouwen als voldoend aan de in het eerste lid omschreven voorwaarde van nieuwheid, zelfs wanneer de in dat lid bedoelde verkoop of terbeschikkingstelling aan derden vóór de in dat lid genoemde termijnen plaatsvond.   
3.  [„Grondgebied” in bepaalde gevallen] Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid kunnen alle Verdragsluitende Partijen die lidstaat zijn van één en dezelfde intergouvernementele organisatie gezamenlijk handelen, wanneer de regelgeving van die organisatie zulks vereist, om handelingen verricht op de grondgebieden van de lidstaten van die organisatie gelijk te stellen met handelingen verricht op hun eigen grondgebied, waarvan zij, indien zij zulks doen, de Secretaris-Generaal in kennis dienen te stellen.   

### Artikel  7  

####Onderscheidbaarheid

Het ras wordt als onderscheidbaar aangemerkt indien het duidelijk te onderscheiden is van elk ander ras waarvan het bestaan op het tijdstip van indiening van de aanvraag algemeen bekend is. In het bijzonder wordt de indiening van een aanvraag tot het verlenen van kwekersrecht voor een ander ras of de inschrijving van een ander ras in een officieel rassenregister, in welk land ook, geacht dat andere ras algemene bekendheid te geven vanaf de datum van de aanvraag, mits de aanvraag leidt tot de verlening van kwekersrecht of tot de inschrijving van dat andere ras in het officiële rassenregister, naar gelang het geval.  

### Artikel  8  

####Homogeniteit

Het ras wordt als eenvormig aangemerkt indien het, behoudens de variatie die mag worden verwacht van de bijzonderheden die eigen zijn aan de vermeerdering ervan, voldoende eenvormig is wat zijn van belang zijnde eigenschappen betreft.  

### Artikel  9  

####Bestendigheid

Het ras wordt als bestendig aangemerkt indien zijn van belang zijnde eigenschappen onveranderd blijven na achtereenvolgende vermeerderingen of, in het geval van een bijzondere vermeerderingscyclus, aan het einde van iedere cyclus.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####AANVRAAG TOT VERLENING VAN HET KWEKERSRECHT

### Artikel  10  

####Indiening van aanvragen

1.  [Plaats van eerste aanvraag] De kweker heeft de vrijheid de Verdragsluitende Partij te kiezen bij wiens dienst hij zijn eerste aanvraag tot kwekersrecht wenst in te dienen.   
2.  [Tijdstip van latere aanvragen] De kweker kan bij de diensten van andere Verdragsluitende Partijen de verlening van kwekersrechten aanvragen zonder de verlening van kwekersrecht aan hem door de dienst van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarbij de eerste aanvraag werd ingediend af te wachten.   
3.  [Onafhankelijkhe id van de bescherming] Geen enkele Verdragsluitende Partij kan de verlening van een kwekersrecht weigeren of de duur daarvan beperken op grond van het feit dat de bescherming van hetzelfde ras niet is aangevraagd, is geweigerd of is vervallen in een andere Staat of intergouvernementele organisatie.   

### Artikel  11  

####Recht van voorrang

1.  [Het recht; de termijn] Een kweker die overeenkomstig de voorschriften een aanvraag om de bescherming van een ras heeft ingediend in één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen („de eerste aanvraag”) geniet voor de indiening van een aanvraag tot verlening van kwekersrecht voor hetzelfde ras bij de dienst van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij („de latere aanvraag”) een recht van voorrang gedurende een termijn van twaalf maanden. De termijn begint te lopen vanaf de datum van indiening van de eerste aanvraag. De dag van indiening is niet in deze termijn begrepen.   
2.  [Beroep op het recht] Om in aanmerking te komen voor het recht van voorrang moet de kweker zich in de latere aanvraag beroepen op de voorrang van de eerste aanvraag. De dienst waarbij de latere aanvraag is ingediend, kan van de kweker verlangen dat deze binnen een termijn van ten minste drie maanden, te rekenen vanaf de datum van indiening van de latere aanvraag, een afschrift overlegt van de bescheiden waaruit de eerste aanvraag bestond, voor eensluidend gewaarmerkt door de dienst waarbij die aanvraag werd ingediend, alsmede monsters en bewijsstukken waaruit blijkt dat het ras waarop beide aanvragen betrekking hebben, hetzelfde is.   
3.  [Bescheiden en materiaal] De kweker beschikt over een termijn van twee jaar na het verstrijken van de voorrangstermijn of, indien de eerste aanvraag wordt afgewezen of ingetrokken, een passende termijn na die afwijzing of intrekking, waarbinnen hij de dienst van de Verdragsluitende Partij waarbij hij de latere aanvraag heeft ingediend alle nodige inlichtingen, bescheiden of materiaal moet verschaffen die c.q. dat de wetgeving van die Verdragsluitende Partij voorschrijft met het oog op het onderzoek ingevolge artikel 12.   
4.  [Feiten die zich voordoen gedurende de voorrangstermijn] Feiten diezich voordoen gedurende de in het eerste lid genoemde termijn, zoals de indiening van een andere aanvraag of de bekendmaking of de exploitatie van het ras waarop de eerste aanvraag betrekking heeft, kunnen geen grond zijn voor afwijzing van de latere aanvraag. Dergelijke feiten kunnen geen rechten van derden doen ontstaan.   

### Artikel  12  

####Onderzoek van de aanvraag

Elke beslissing tot verlening van kwekersrecht vereist een onderzoek betreffende het voldoen aan de in de artikelen 5 tot en met 9 genoemde voorwaarden. In de loop van het onderzoek mag de dienst het ras telen of doen telen of andere noodzakelijke proeven uitvoeren of doen uitvoeren, of de resultaten van reeds uitgevoerde teeltproeven of andere proeven in aanmerking nemen. Met het oog op het onderzoek kan de dienst alle benodigde inlichtingen, bescheiden of materiaal van de kweker verlangen.  

### Artikel  13  

####Voorlopige bescherming

Elke Verdragsluitende Partij treft maatregelen om de belangen van de kweker veilig te stellen gedurende het tijdvak tussen de indiening of de bekendmaking van de aanvraag tot verlening van kwekersrecht en de verlening van dat recht. Deze maatregelen zijn van zodanige strekking dat de houder van het kwekersrecht ten minste recht heeft op een billijke vergoeding van iedere persoon die gedurende genoemd tijdvak handelingen heeft verricht waarvoor, na verlening van het recht, de toestemming van de kweker, als bedoeld in artikel 14, is vereist. Een Verdragsluitende Partij kan bepalen dat genoemde maatregelen alleen gelden met betrekking tot personen die de kweker uitdrukkelijk in kennis heeft gesteld van de indiening van de aanvraag.  

### HOOFDSTUK  V

b. De kweker kan aan zijn toestemming voorwaarden en beperkingen verbinden.     
2.  [Handelingen met betrekking tot geoogst materiaal] Behoudens de artikelen 15 en 16 is de toestemming van de kweker vereist voor de onder i tot en met vii van letter a van het eerste lid genoemde handelingen met betrekking tot geoogst materiaal, met inbegrip van hele planten en delen van planten, verkregen door middel van gebruik van teeltmateriaal van het beschermde ras waarvoor geen toestemming is verleend, tenzij de kweker met betrekking tot bedoeld teeltmateriaal een redelijke mogelijkheid tot uitoefening van zijn recht heeft gehad.   
3.  [Handelingen met betrekking tot bepaalde produkten] Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan bepalen dat, behoudens de artikelen 15 en 16, de toestemming van de kweker is vereist voor de in de punten i tot en met vii van letter a van het eerste lid genoemde handelingen met betrekking tot produkten die rechtstreeks zijn vervaardigd uit onder de bepalingen van het tweede lid vallend geoogst materiaal van het beschermde ras door middel van gebruik van bedoeld geoogst materiaal waarvoor geen toestemming is verleend, tenzij de kweker met betrekking tot bedoeld geoogst materiaal een redelijke mogelijkheid tot uitoefening van zijn recht heeft gehad.   
4.  [Eventuele extra handelingen] Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan bepalen dat, behoudens de artikelen 15 en 16, de toestemming van de kweker ook is vereist voor andere handelingen dan die welke zijn genoemd onder i tot en met vii van letter a van het eerste lid.   
5.  [Afgeleide rassen en bepaalde andere rassen]

i. het hoofdzakelijk is afgeleid van het oorspronkelijke ras of van een ras dat zelf hoofdzakelijk is afgeleid van het oorspronkelijke ras, met behoud van de expressie van de wezenlijke eigenschappen die het resultaat is van een bepaald genotype of een combinatie van genotypen van het oorspronkelijke ras,  

ii. het duidelijk te onderscheiden is van het oorspronkelijke ras en  

iii. het, afgezien van de afwijkingen die voortvloeien uit de afleidingshandeling, overeenkomt met het oorspronkelijke ras qua wezenlijke eigenschappen waarin het genotype of de combinatie van genotypen van het oorspronkelijke ras tot uitdrukking komt.    

c. In wezen afgeleide rassen kunnen bijvoorbeeld zijn verkregen door middel van de selectie van een natuurlijke of teweeggebrachte mutant, of van een somaklonale variant, de selectie van een individu dat afwijkt van planten van het oorspronkelijke ras, terugkruisingen of transformatie door middel van genetische modificatie.     

### Artikel  15

2.  [Facultatieve uitzondering] Onverminderd artikel 14 kan elke Verdragsluitende Partij, binnen redelijke grenzen en met inachtneming van de legitieme belangen van de kweker, het kwekersrecht beperken met betrekking tot ieder ras, teneinde telers in staat te stellen, voor vermeerderingsdoeleinden binnen hun eigen bedrijf, het produkt van de oogst te gebruiken dat zij hebben verkregen door het beschermde ras of een ras dat valt onder artikel 14, vijfde lid, letter a, onder i of ii, binnen hun eigen bedrijf te planten.   

### Artikel  16  

####Uitputting van het kwekersrecht

1.  [Uitputting van het recht] Het kwekersrecht strekt zich niet uit tot handelingen betreffende materiaal van het beschermde ras, of van een ras dat valt onder de bepalingen van artikel 14, vijfde lid, dat door de kweker, dan wel met diens toestemming, op het grondgebied van de desbetreffende Verdragsluitende Partij is verkocht of anderszins in de handel is gebracht, of materiaal dat van genoemd materiaal is afgeleid, tenzij die handelingen 

i. verdere vermeerdering van het ras in kwestie inhouden of  

ii. uitvoer van materiaal van het ras inhouden, waardoor de vermeerdering van het ras mogelijk wordt gemaakt, naar een land dat geen bescherming kent van rassen van het plantengeslacht of de plantesoort waartoe het ras behoort, behalve wanneer het uitvoer voor verbruiksdoeleinden betreft.     
2.  [Betekenis van „materiaal”] Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid wordt, met betrekking tot een ras, verstaan onder „materiaal”: 

i. elk soort teeltmateriaal,

### Artikel  17  

####Beperking van de uitoefening van het kwekersrecht

1.  [Algemeen belang] Behalve wanneer zulks uitdrukkelijk in dit Verdrag is bepaald, kan een Verdragsluitende Partij de vrije uitoefening van het kwekersrecht slechts beperken om redenen van algemeen belang.   
2.  [Billijke vergoeding] Wanneer zo'n beperking ertoe leidt dat een derde wordt gemachtigd een handeling te verrichten waarvoor de toestemming van de kweker vereist is, treft de betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij alle noodzakelijke maatregelen om te verzekeren dat de kweker een billijke vergoeding ontvangt.   

### Artikel  18  

####Maatregelen ter zake van de verhandeling

Het kwekersrecht is niet afhankelijk van door een Verdragsluitende Partij getroffen maatregelen ter regulering op haar grondgebied van de voortbrenging van, de controle op en de verhandeling van materiaal van rassen of de invoer of uitvoer van dat materiaal. Dergelijke maatregelen laten in elk geval de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag onverlet.  

### Artikel  19

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####RASBENAMING

### Artikel  20  

####Rasbenaming

1.  [Aanduiding van rassen door benamingen; gebruik van de benaming] 

a. Het ras wordt aangeduid door een benaming, bestemd om de soortaanduiding ervan te worden.  

b. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij draagt er zorg voor dat, behoudens het bepaalde in het vierde lid, geen enkel recht betreffende de aanduiding, die als benaming van het ras is ingeschreven, het vrije gebruik van de benaming in verband met het ras belemmert, zelfs niet na afloop van het kwekersrecht.     
2.  [Kenmerken van de benaming] De benaming moet de identificatie van het ras mogelijk maken. Zij mag niet uitsluitend uit cijfers bestaan, tenzij dit een gevestigd gebruik is voor de aanduiding van rassen. Zij mag niet zodanig zijn, dat zij tot vergissing aanleiding kan geven of verwarring zou kunnen stichten omtrent de karakteristieke eigenschappen, de waarde of de identiteit van het ras of de identiteit van de kweker. Zij moet in het bijzonder verschillen van iedere benaming die op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij een reeds bestaand ras van dezelfde plantesoort of van een nauw verwante soort aanduidt.   
3.  [Inschrijving van de benaming] De benaming van het ras wordt door de kweker gedeponeerd bij de dienst. Indien blijkt dat de benaming niet beantwoordt aan de in het tweede lid gestelde eisen, weigert de dienst de inschrijving en verlangt hij van de kweker dat deze binnen een bepaalde termijn een andere benaming voorstelt. De benaming wordt tegelijkertijd met de verlening van het kwekersrecht door de dienst ingeschreven.   
4.  [Oudere rechten van derden] Oudere rechten van derden blijven onverlet. Indien op grond van een ouder recht het gebruik van de benaming van een ras wordt verboden aan een persoon die overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het zevende lid verplicht is die benaming te gebruiken, verlangt de dienst van de kweker dat deze een andere benaming voor het ras voorstelt.   
5.  [Eenzelfde benaming in alle Verdragsluitende Partijen] Voor een ras kan in alle Verdragsluitende Partijen slechts éénzelfde benaming worden gedeponeerd. De dienst van elke Verdragsluitende Partij schrijft de aldus gedeponeerde benaming in, tenzij hij vaststelt dat die benaming voor gebruik op zijn grondgebied ongeschikt is. In dat geval verlangt hij van de kweker dat deze een andere benaming voorstelt.   
6.  [Wederzijds inlichten door diensten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen] De dienst van een Verdragsluitende Partij draagt er zorg voor dat de diensten van de andere Verdragsluitende Partijen worden ingelicht omtrent zaken betreffende rasbenamingen, met name de deponering, inschrijving en doorhaling van benamingen. Iedere dienst kan zijn eventuele opmerkingen inzake de inschrijving van een benaming mededelen aan de dienst die deze benaming bekend heeft gemaakt.   
7.  [Verplichting de benaming te gebruiken] Degene die op het grondgebied van één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen teeltmateriaal van een ras dat op dat grondgebied is beschermd te koop aanbiedt of verhandelt, is verplicht de benaming van dat ras te gebruiken, zelfs na afloop van het kwekersrecht op dat ras, behalve wanneer overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het vierde lid, oudere rechten dit gebruik beletten.   
8.  [Aanduidingen die aan de benaming worden toegevoegd] Wanneer een ras te koop wordt aangeboden of wordt verhandeld, is het toegestaan een fabrieks- of handelsmerk of een soortgelijke aanduiding toe te voegen aan de ingeschreven rasbenaming. Indien een dergelijke aanduiding wordt toegevoegd, dient de benaming niettemin gemakkelijk herkenbaar te zijn.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####NIETIGVERKLARING EN VERVALLENVERKLARING VAN HET KWEKERSRECHT

### Artikel  21  

####Nietigverklaring van het kwekersrecht

1.  [Gronden voor nietigverklaring] Elke Verdragsluitende Partij verklaart een door haar verleend kwekersrecht nietig wanneer wordt vastgesteld 

i. dat op het tijdstip van verlening van het kwekersrecht niet is voldaan aan de in de artikelen 6 en 7 neergelegde voorwaarden,  

ii. dat, wanneer de verlening van het kwekersrecht in hoofdzaak is gebaseerd op door de kweker verstrekte inlichtingen en bescheiden, op het tijdstip van verlening van het kwekersrecht niet is voldaan aan de in de artikelen 8 en 9 neergelegde voorwaarden, of  

iii. dat het kwekersrecht is verleend aan een persoon die daartoe niet gerechtigd is, tenzij het wordt overgedragen aan de persoon die daartoe wel gerechtigd is.     
2.  [Geen andere gronden] Het kwekersrecht kan niet worden nietig verklaard op andere gronden dan de in het eerste lid genoemde.   

### Artikel  22  

####Vervallenverklaring van het kwekersrecht

1.  [Gronden voor vervallenverklaring] 

a. Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan een door haar verleend kwekersrecht vervallen verklaren indien wordt vastgesteld dat niet meer wordt voldaan aan de in de artikelen 8 en 9 neergelegde voorwaarden.  

b. Voorts kan elke Verdragsluitende Partij een door haar verleend kwekersrecht vervallen verklaren indien, na daartoe te zijn aangemaand en binnen een voorgeschreven termijn: 

i. de kweker niet aan de dienst de inlichtingen, de bescheiden of het materiaal verstrekt die noodzakelijk worden geacht voor de controle op de instandhouding van het ras,  

ii. de kweker niet de rechten betaalt die eventueel verschuldigd zijn voor de handhaving van zijn recht, of  

iii. de kweker niet een andere geschikte benaming voorstelt, ingeval de benaming van het ras na de verlening van het recht wordt doorgehaald.       
2.  [Geen andere gronden] Het kwekersrecht kan niet worden vervallen verklaard op andere gronden dan de in het eerste lid genoemde.

ii. vergoeding van verrichte diensten, andere inkomsten.     
2.  [Bijdragen; eenheden] 

a. Het aandeel van iedere Staat die lid is van de Unie in het totale bedrag van die jaarlijkse bijdragen wordt bepaald op basis van het totale bedrag der uitgaven dat door de bijdragen van de Staten die lid zijn van de Unie moet worden gedekt en van het aantal bijdrage-eenheden dat krachtens het derde lid van toepassing is. Bedoeld aandeel wordt overeenkomstig het vierde lid berekend.  

b. Het aantal bijdrage-eenheden wordt in hele getallen of in gedeelten daarvan uitgedrukt, mits dit getal niet kleiner is dan een vijfde.     
3.  [Bijdragen; aandeel van elk lid] 

a. Het aantal bijdrage-eenheden dat van toepassing is op een lid van de Unie dat partij is bij de Akte van 1961 /1972 of de Akte van 1978 op de datum waarop het door dit Verdrag wordt gebonden, is hetzelfde als het aantal dat onmiddellijk voor bedoelde datum op dit lid van toepassing is.  

b. Iedere andere Staat die lid is van de Unie geeft bij zijn toetreding tot de Unie in een verklaring, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal, het aantal bijdrage-eenheden aan dat op hem van toepassing is.  

c. Een Staat die lid is van de Unie kan te allen tijde in een verklaring, gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal, een aantal bijdrageeenheden aangeven dat afwijkt van hetgeen krachtens het bepaalde in de letter a of b op hem van toepassing is. Indien een zodanige verklaring wordt afgelegd gedurende de eerste zes maanden van een kalenderjaar, wordt zij van kracht met ingang van het volgende kalenderjaar; indien dit niet het geval is, wordt zij van kracht met ingang van het tweede kalenderjaar dat volgt op het jaar waarin de verklaring werd afgelegd.

a. Voor iedere begrotingsperiode is het bedrag van één bijdrageeenheid gelijk aan het totale bedrag van de gedurende die periode door de bijdragen van de Staten die lid zijn van de Unie te dekken uitgaven, gedeeld door het totale aantal eenheden dat op die Lidstaten van toepassing is.  

b. Het bedrag van de bijdrage van iedere Staat die lid is van de Unie is gelijk aan het bedrag van één bijdrage-eenheid, vermenigvuldigd met het aantal eenheden dat op die Lidstaat van toepassing is.     
5.  [Betalingsachterstand] 

a. Een Staat die lid is van de Unie die achterstallig is met de betaling van zijn bijdragen kan - behoudens het bepaalde in letter b zijn stemrecht in de Raad niet uitoefenen, indien het bedrag van zijn betalingsachterstand gelijk is aan of hoger dan het bedrag van de door hem verschuldigde bijdrage over het afgelopen volle jaar. De opschorting van het stemrecht ontslaat deze Lidstaat niet van zijn uit dit Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen en ontzet hem niet uit andere uit dit Verdrag voortvloeiende rechten.  

b. De Raad kan de Staat die lid is van de Unie toestaan zijn stemrecht te blijven uitoefenen indien, en zolang, de Raad van mening is dat de betalingsachterstand het gevolg is van buitengewone en onvermijdbare omstandigheden.     
6.  [Verificatie van de rekeningen] De verificatie van de rekeningen van de Unie wordt verricht door een Staat die lid is van de Unie overeenkomstig de regelen als voorzien in het administratief en financieel reglement. Deze Lidstaat wordt, met zijn instemming, aangewezen door de Raad.
