### TITEL  VI  

####FINANCIËLE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  18  

####Financiële middelen

18.1.  De verdragsluitende partijen verplichten zich om een financieringsbeleid te voeren voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel.   
18.2.  De doelstellingen van het financieringsbeleid zijn het versterken van beschikbaarheid, doorzichtigheid, efficiëntie en doelmatigheid van het verstrekken van financiële middelen om activiteiten in het kader van dit Verdrag te kunnen uitvoeren.   
18.3.  Om middelen vrij te maken voor activiteiten, plannen en programma's die de voorkeur genieten, met name in ontwikkelingslanden en in landen met een overgangseconomie, en rekening houdend met het Wereldactieplan, dient het bestuursorgaan periodiek een doelstelling te formuleren voor deze financiering.   
18.4.  Overeenkomstig dit financieringsbeleid: 

a. Dienen de verdragsluitende partijen in de bestuursorganen van relevante internationale mechanismen, fondsen en organen de noodzakelijke en passende maatregelen te treffen om te waarborgen dat gepaste prioriteit en aandacht wordt gegeven aan de doelmatige toewijzing van te verwachten en overeengekomen middelen voor de uitvoering toepassing van plannen en programma's in het kader van dit Verdrag.  

b. De mate waarin verdragsluitende landen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en verdragsluitende partijen die landen met een overgangseconomie zijn op doelmatige wijze hun verplichtingen krachtens dit Verdrag nakomen, is afhankelijk van de doelmatige toewijzing, in het bijzonder door de verdragsluitende partijen die ontwikkelde landen zijn, van de in dit artikel genoemde financiële middelen. Verdragsluitende partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en verdragsluitende partijen die landen met een overgangseconomie zijn dienen in hun eigen plannen en programma's gepaste prioriteit te geven aan het ontwikkelen van hun capaciteit met betrekking tot plantgenetische bronnen voor voedsel en landbouw.  

c. Verdragsluitende partijen die ontwikkelde landen zijn verstrekken tevens financiële middelen, en verdragsluitende partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en verdragsluitende partijen die landen met een overgangseconomie zijn benutten die financiële middelen voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag via bilaterale, regionale en multilaterale kanalen. In die kanalen dient het in artikel 19, lid 3, onder f) genoemde mechanisme te worden opgenomen.  

d. Elke verdragsluitende partij verplicht zich ertoe nationale activiteiten te ontplooien en financiële middelen voor die activiteiten te verstrekken ten behoeve van het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van plantgenetische bronnen voor voedsel en landbouw, overeenkomstig de nationale capaciteit en de financiële middelen van die partij. De verstrekte financiële middelen mogen niet worden aangewend voor doeleinden die strijdig zijn met dit Verdrag, in het bijzonder in sectoren die verband houden met de internationale handel in producten.  

e. De verdragsluitende partijen komen overeen dat de financiële voordelen die voortvloeien uit het bepaalde in artikel 13, lid 2, onder d), onderdeel vormen van het financieringsbeleid.  

f. Vrijwillige bijdragen kunnen ook worden gegeven door verdragsluitende partijen, de particuliere sector, rekening houdend met de bepalingen in artikel 13, niet-gouvernementele instanties en andere bronnen. De verdragsluitende partijen komen overeen dat het bestuursorgaan de modaliteiten van een beleid om dergelijke bijdragen te stimuleren onderzoekt.     
18.5.  De verdragsluitende partijen komen overeen dat prioriteit wordt gegeven aan de tenuitvoerlegging van plannen en programma's die zijn overeengekomen voor boeren in ontwikkelingslanden, met name in landen die het minst ontwikkeld zijn en landen met een overgangseconomie, die op duurzame wijze plantgenetische bronnen voor voedsel en landbouw in stand houden en gebruiken.
