1.  De plaats, de toegangen, de bouw en de inrichting in verband met andere gedeelten, van de verblijven moeten zo zijn gekozen, dat zij voldoende veiligheid, bescherming tegen wind en zee, en isolatie van warmte of koude, hinderlijk lawaai en geuren uit andere gedeelten van het schip, verzekeren.   
2.  Er mag van de ruimen, machinekamers, ketelruimen, kombuizen, lampenhutten en verfhokken, of van de bergplaatsen voor machinekamer- en dekbehoeften en algemene bergplaatsen, droogkamers, gemeenschappelijke wasplaatsen en w.c.'s geen rechtstreekse toegang naar de slaapruimten bestaan. Dat gedeelte van het schot, dat genoemde ruimten van de slaapruimten scheidt, zomede de buitenwanden, moeten doelmatig zijn vervaardigd van staal of van ander goedgekeurd materiaal en gasdicht zijn.   
3.  Buitenwanden van slaap- en eetverblijven moeten voldoende zijn geïsoleerd. De machinekamerschacht en alle eindschotten van kombuizen en andere ruimten, waarin warmte wordt opgewekt, moeten voldoende zijn geïsoleerd, wanneer de mogelijkheid bestaat, dat warmteuitstraling naar de aangrenzende verblijven of gangen kan ontstaan. Ook zal er zorg voor moeten worden gedragen, dat in bescherming tegen warmte-uitstraling van stoom- en/of heet-waterdienstleidingen is voorzien.   
4.  Schotten in de verblijven moeten vervaardigd zijn van goedgekeurd materiaal, waarin zich niet gemakkelijk ongedierte kan nestelen.   
5.  Slaap- en eetverblijven, ontspanningsruimten en gangen in het gedeelte van het schip waar de verblijven van de bemanning zich bevinden, moeten voldoende zijn geïsoleerd, teneinde condensatie of te hoge temperatuur te voorkomen.   
6.  Hoofdstoom- en afvoerleidingen van lieren en andere hulpwerktuigen moeten buiten de verblijven en wanneer dit technisch uitvoerbaar is, buiten de gangen naar de verblijven worden gehouden. Wanneer dit laatste onmogelijk is, moeten de leidingen voldoende geïsoleerd en ingebouwd zijn.   
7.  De binnenwegering of beschieting moet vervaardigd zijn van materiaal, waarvan de oppervlakte gemakkelijk kan worden schoongehouden. Geploegde en gegroefde planken en elke andere wijze van betimmering, waarin zich gemakkelijk ongedierte kan nestelen, mogen niet worden gebezigd.
