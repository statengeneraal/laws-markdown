In geen geval mogen een volk zijn bestaansmiddelen worden ontnomen.   
3.  De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, met inbegrip van de Staten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het beheer van gebieden zonder zelfbestuur en van trustgebieden, bevorderen de verwezenlijking van het zelfbeschikkingsrecht en eerbiedigen dit recht overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Handvest der Verenigde Naties.

### Artikel  5  

1.  Geen bepaling van dit Verdrag mag zodanig worden uitgelegd als zou zij voor een Staat, een groep of een persoon het recht inhouden enige activiteit te ontplooien of enige daad te verrichten, die ten doel heeft de rechten en vrijheden welke in dit Verdrag zijn erkend, te vernietigen of deze rechten en vrijheden meer te beperken dan bij dit Verdrag is voorzien.   
2.  Het is niet toegestaan enig fundamenteel recht van de mens dat in een land, ingevolge wettelijke bepalingen, overeenkomsten, voorschriften of gewoonten, wordt erkend of bestaat, te beperken of ervan af te wijken, onder voorwendsel dat dit Verdrag die rechten niet erkent of dat het deze slechts in mindere mate erkent.

(c) Niet als „dwangarbeid of verplichte arbeid" in de zin van dit lid worden beschouwd:

3.  Een ieder die op beschuldiging van het begaan van een strafbaar feit wordt gearresteerd of gevangen gehouden dient onverwijld voor de rechter te worden geleid of voor een andere autoriteit die door de wet bevoegd is verklaard rechterlijke macht uit te oefenen en heeft het recht binnen een redelijke termijn berecht te worden of op vrije voeten te worden gesteld. Het mag geen regel zijn dat personen die op hun berechting wachten in voorarrest worden gehouden, doch aan hun invrijheidstelling kunnen voorwaarden worden verbonden om te waarborgen dat de betrokkene verschijnt ter terechtzitting, in andere stadia van de gerechtelijke procedure dan wel, zo het geval zich voordoet, voor de tenuitvoerlegging van het vonnis.   
4.  Een ieder wie door arrestatie of gevangenhouding zijn vrijheid is ontnomen, heeft het recht voorziening te vragen bij de rechter, opdat die rechter binnen korte termijn beslist over de wettigheid van zijn gevangenhouding en zijn invrijheidstelling beveelt, indien zijn gevangenhouding onrechtmatig is.   
5.  Een ieder die het slachtoffer is geweest van een onwettige arrestatie of gevangenhouding heeft recht op schadeloosstelling.   

### Artikel  10

(b) Jeugdige verdachten dienen gescheiden te worden gehouden van volwassenen en zo spoedig mogelijk voor de rechter te worden geleid.     
3.  Het gevangenisstelsel dient te voorzien in een behandeling van gevangenen die in de eerste plaats is gericht op heropvoeding en reclassering. Jeugdige overtreders dienen gescheiden te worden gehouden van volwassenen en behandeld te worden in overeenstemming met hun leeftijd en wettelijke staat.   

### Artikel  11  

Niemand mag gevangen worden genomen uitsluitend omdat hij niet in staat is een uit een overeenkomst voortvloeiende verplichting na te komen.  

### Artikel  12  

1.  Een ieder die wettig op het grondgebied van een Staat verblijft, heeft, binnen dit grondgebied, het recht zich vrijelijk te verplaatsen en er zijn verblijfplaats vrijelijk te kiezen.   
2.  Een ieder heeft het recht welk land ook, met inbegrip van het eigen land, te verlaten.   
3.  De bovengenoemde rechten kunnen aan geen andere beperkingen worden onderworpen dan die welke bij de wet zijn voorzien, nodig zijn ter bescherming van de nationale veiligheid, de openbare orde, de volksgezondheid of de goede zeden of van de rechten en vrijheden van anderen en verenigbaar zijn met de andere in dit Verdrag erkende rechten.   
4.  Aan niemand mag willekeurig het recht worden ontnomen naar zijn eigen land terug te keren.   

### Artikel  13  

Een vreemdeling die wettig op het grondgebied verblijft van een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag, kan slechts uit die Staat worden gezet krachtens een overeenkomstig de wet genomen beslissing, terwijl het hem, tenzij dwingende redenen van nationale veiligheid een tegengestelde beslissing rechtvaardigen, is toegestaan zijn bezwaren tegen zijn uitzetting kenbaar te maken en zijn geval opnieuw te doen beoordelen door, en zich met dit doel te doen vertegenwoordigen bij de bevoegde autoriteit dan wel door een of meer personen die daartoe speciaal door de bevoegde autoriteit zijn aangewezen.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Allen zijn gelijk voor de rechter en de rechterlijke instanties. Bij het bepalen van de gegrondheid van een tegen hem ingestelde strafvervolging, of het vaststellen van zijn burgerlijke rechten en verplichtingen in een rechtsgeding, heeft een ieder recht op een eerlijke en openbare behandeling door een bevoegde, onafhankelijke en onpartijdige bij de wet ingestelde rechterlijke instantie. De terechtzitting kan geheel of ten dele met gesloten deuren plaatsvinden, hetzij in het belang van de goede zeden, de openbare orde of de nationale veiligheid in een democratische samenleving, hetzij wanneer het belang van het privé leven van de partijen bij het proces dit vereist, hetzij voorzover de rechter dit strikt noodzakelijk acht op grond van de overweging, dat een openbare behandeling het belang van de rechtspraak zou schaden; evenwel zal elk vonnis dat wordt gewezen in een strafrechtelijk of burgerrechtelijk geding openbaar zijn, tenzij het belang van jeugdige personen zich daartegen verzet of het proces echtelijke twisten of de voogdij over kinderen betreft.   
2.  Een ieder die wegens een strafbaar feit wordt vervolgd wordt voor onschuldig gehouden, totdat zijn schuld volgens de wet is bewezen.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de gegrondheid van een tegen hem ingestelde strafvervolging heeft een ieder, in volle gelijkheid, recht op de volgende minimumgaranties: 

(a) onverwijld en in bijzonderheden, in een taal die hij verstaat, op de hoogte te worden gesteld van de aard en de reden van de tegen hem ingebrachte beschuldiging;  

(b) te beschikken over voldoende tijd en faciliteiten die nodig zijn voor de voorbereiding van zijn verdediging en zich te verstaan met een door hemzelf gekozen raadsman;  

(c) zonder onredelijke vertraging te worden berecht;  

(d) in zijn tegenwoordigheid te worden berecht, zichzelf te verdedigen of de bijstand te hebben van een raadsman naar eigen keuze; ingeval hij geen rechtsbijstand heeft, van het recht daarop in kennis te worden gesteld; rechtsbijstand toegewezen te krijgen, indien het belang van de rechtspraak dit eist, en zonder dat daarvoor betaling van hem kan worden verlangd, indien hij niet over voldoende middelen beschikt;  

(e) de getuigen à charge te ondervragen of te doen ondervragen en het oproepen en de ondervraging van getuigen a décharge te doen geschieden op dezelfde voorwaarden als het geval is met de getuigen à charge;  

(f) zich kosteloos te doen bijstaan door een tolk, indien hij de taal die ter zitting wordt gebezigd niet verstaat of niet spreekt;  

(g) niet te worden gedwongen tegen zichzelf te getuigen of een bekentenis af te leggen.     
4.  Wanneer het jeugdige personen betreft, dient rekening te worden gehouden met hun leeftijd en de wenselijkheid hun reclassering te bevorderen.   
5.  Een ieder die wegens een strafbaar feit is veroordeeld heeft het recht de schuldigverklaring en veroordeling opnieuw te doen beoordelen door een hoger rechtscollege overeenkomstig de wet.   
6.  Indien iemand wegens een strafbaar feit onherroepelijk is veroordeeld en het vonnis vervolgens is vernietigd, of indien hem daarna gratie is verleend, op grond van de overweging dat een nieuw of een pas aan het licht gekomen feit onomstotelijk aantoont dat van een gerechtelijke dwaling sprake is, wordt degene die, als gevolg van die veroordeling, straf heeft ondergaan, overeenkomstig de wet schadeloos gesteld, tenzij wordt aangetoond dat het niet tijdig bekend worden van het onbekende feit geheel of gedeeltelijk aan hemzelf te wijten was.   
7.  Niemand mag voor een tweede keer worden berecht of gestraft voor een strafbaar feit waarvoor hij reeds overeenkomstig de wet en het procesrecht van elk land bij onherroepelijke uitspraak is veroordeeld of waarvan hij is vrijgesproken.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Niemand kan worden veroordeeld wegens een handelen of nalaten, dat geen strafbaar feit naar nationaal of internationaal recht uitmaakte ten tijde dat het handelen of nalaten geschiedde. Evenmin mag een zwaardere straf worden opgelegd dan die welke ten tijde van het begaan van het strafbare feit van toepassing was. Indien, na het begaan van het strafbare feit de wet mocht voorzien in de oplegging van een lichtere straf, dient de overtreder daarvan te profiteren.   
2.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel staat in de weg aan het vonnis en de straf van iemand die schuldig is aan een handelen of nalaten, hetwelk ten tijde dat het handelen of nalaten geschiedde, van strafrechtelijke aard was overeenkomstig de algemene rechtsbeginselen die door de volkerengemeenschap worden erkend.   

### Artikel  16

Kennisgevingen als bedoeld in dit artikel kunnen alleen in ontvangst worden genomen en worden behandeld indien zij zijn ingezonden door een Staat die partij is, die een verklaring heeft afgelegd dat hij ten aanzien van zichzelf deze bevoegdheid van het Comité erkent. Geen kennisgeving wordt door het Comité in ontvangst genomen, indien het een Staat die partij is betreft, die zulk een verklaring niet heeft afgelegd. Kennisgevingen die krachtens het bepaalde in dit artikel worden ontvangen worden overeenkomstig de volgende procedure behandeld: 

(a) Indien een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag van oordeel is dat een andere Staat die partij is de bepalingen van dit Verdrag niet uitvoert, kan hij door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving de zaak onder de aandacht brengen van die Staat die partij is. Binnen drie maanden na ontvangst van de kennisgeving stuurt de ontvangende Staat de Staat die de kennisgeving had gezonden een schriftelijke uiteenzetting of een andere schriftelijke verklaring, waarin de zaak wordt opgehelderd en waarin, voor zover mogelijk en ter zake doende, wordt verwezen naar procedures en rechtsmiddelen die in het land zelf reeds zijn toegepast, nog hangende zijn of waartoe zou kunnen worden overgegaan.

(c) Het Comité behandelt een bij hem aanhangig gemaakte zaak alleen nadat het er zich van heeft overtuigd dat alle beschikbare binnenlandse rechtsmiddelen in de betrokken zaak zijn benut en uitgeput, in overeenstemming met de algemeen erkende beginselen van het internationale recht. Dit is evenwel niet het geval indien de toepassing der rechtsmiddelen onredelijk lange tijd vergt.  

(d) Het Comité komt in besloten zitting bijeen wanneer het kennisgevingen krachtens dit artikel gedaan aan een onderzoek onderwerpt.  

(e) Met inachtneming van het bepaalde in alinea (c) stelt het Comité zijn goede diensten ter beschikking van de betrokken Staten die partij zijn, ten einde de zaak in der minne te regelen op basis van eerbied voor de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden als erkend in dit Verdrag.

(i) indien een oplossing als voorzien in alinea (e) is bereikt, beperkt het Comité zijn rapport tot een korte uiteenzetting van de feiten en van de bereikte oplossing;  

(ii) indien geen oplossing als voorzien in alinea (e) is bereikt, beperkt het Comité zijn rapport tot een korte uiteenzetting van de feiten; de schriftelijk kenbaar gemaakte standpunten en een op schrift gestelde samenvatting van de mondeling naar voren gebrachte standpunten van de Staten die partij zijn, worden aan het rapport gehecht.

Deze verklaringen worden door de Staten die partij zijn nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, die afschrift daarvan doet toekomen aan de andere Staten die partij zijn. Een zodanige verklaring kan te allen tijde, door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal gerichte kennisgeving, worden ingetrokken. Een zodanige intrekking heeft geen invloed op de behandeling van een zaak die het onderwerp vormt van een kennisgeving die reeds is gedaan krachtens dit artikel; geen enkele volgende kennisgeving door een Staat die partij is wordt in ontvangst genomen nadat de kennisgeving van intrekking van de verklaring door de Secretaris-Generaal is ontvangen, tenzij de betrokken Staat die partij is een nieuwe verklaring heeft afgelegd.
