### Annex  II  

####Structural safety requirements and tests

### *Introduction* 

In setting the requirements of this Annex, it is implicit that in all phases of the operation of containers the forces as a result of motion, location, stacking and weight of the loaded container and external forces will not exceed the design strength of the container. In particular, the following assumptions have been made: 

(a) the container will so be restrained that it is not subjected to forces in excess of those for which it has been designed;  

(b) the container will have its cargo stowed in accordance with the recommended practices of the trade so that the cargo does not impose upon the container forces in excess of those for which it has been designed.   
### *Construction* 

1. A container made from any suitable material which satisfactorily performs the following tests without sustaining any permanent deformation or abnormality which would render it incapable of being used for its designed purpose shall be considered safe.  

2. The dimensions, positioning and associated tolerances of corner fittings shall be checked having regard to the lifting and securing systems in which they will function.   
### *Test loads and test procedures* 

Where appropriate to the design of the container, the following test loads and test procedures shall be applied to all kinds of containers under test:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| TEST LOADINGS AND APPLIED FORCES  | TEST PROCEDURES  |
| 1. LIFTING  |
| The container, having the prescribed internal loading, shall be lifted in such a way that no significant acceleration forces are applied. After lifting, the container shall be suspended or supported for five minutes and then lowered to the ground.  | --- |
|  *(A) LIFTING FROM CORNER FITTINGS*   |
|  *Internal loading:*   | (i) *Lifting from top corner fittings:*  |
| A uniformly distributed load such that the combined weight of container and test load is equal to 2R. In the case of a tank-container, when the test weight of the internal load plus the tare weight is less than 2R, a supplementary load distributed over the length of the tank is to be applied to the container.  | Containers greater than 3,000 mm (10 ft.) (nominal) in length shall have lifting forces applied vertically at all four top corner fittings.  |
| --- | Containers of 3,000 mm (10 ft.) (nominal) in length nor less shall have lifting forces applied at all four top corner fittings, in such a way that the angle between each lifting device and the vertical shall be 30°.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | (ii) *Lifting from bottom corner fittings:*  |
| Such as to lift the combined weight of 2R in the manner prescribed (under the heading TEST PROCEDURES).  | Containers shall have lifting forces applied in such a manner that the lifting devices bear on the bottom corner fittings only. The lifting forces shall be applied at angles to the horizontal of:  30° for containers of length 12,000 mm (40 ft.) (nominal) or greater;  37° for containers of length 9,000 mm (30 ft.) (nominal) and up to but not including 12,000 mm (40 ft.) (nominal);  45° for containers of length 6,000 mm (20 ft.) (nominal) and up to but not including 9,000 mm (30 ft.) (nominal) ;  60° for containers of less than 6,000 mm (20 ft.) (nominal).  |
|  *(B) LIFTING BY ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL METHODS*   |
|  *Internal loading:*   | (i) *Lifting from fork lift pockets:*  |
| A uniformly distributed load such that the combined weight of container and test load is equal to 1.25 R. In the case of a tank-container, when the test weight of the internal load plus the tare weight is less than 1.25R, a supplementary load distributed over the length of the tank is to be applied to the container.  | The container shall be placed on bars which are in the same horizontal plane, one bar centred within each fork lift pocket which is used for lifting the loaded container. The bars shall be of the same width as the forks intended to be used in the handling, and shall project into the fork pocket 75 per cent of the length of the fork pocket.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   |
| Such as to lift the combined weight of 1.25 R in the manner prescribed (under the heading TEST PROCEDURES).  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | (ii) *Lifting from grappler arm positions:*  |
| A uniformly distributed load such that the combined weight of containers and test load is equal to 1.25 R.  | The container shall be placed on pads in the same horizontal plane, one under each grappler arm position. These pads shall be of the same sizes as the lifting area of the grappler arms intended to be used.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   |
| Such as to lift the combined weight of 1.25 R in the manner prescribed (under the heading TEST PROCEDURES).  |
| --- | (iii) *Other Methods*  |
| --- | Where containers are designed to be lifted in the loaded condition by any method not mentioned in (A) or (B) (i) and (ii) they shall also be tested with the INTERNAL LOADING AND EXTERNALLY APPLIED FORCES representative of the acceleration conditions appropriate to that method.  |
| 2. STACKING  |
| 1. For conditions of international transport where the maximum vertical acceleration forces vary significantly from 1.8 g and when the container is reliably and effectively limited to such conditions of transport, the stacking load may be varied by the appropriate ratio of acceleration forces.  |
| 2. On successful completion of this test the container may be rated for the allowable superimposed static stacking weight which should be indicated on the Safety Approval Plate against the heading “Allowable stacking weight for 1.8 g (kilogrammes and lbs)”.  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| A uniformly distributed load such that the combined weight of container and test load is equal to 1.8 R. Tank containers may be tested in the tare condition.  | The container, having the prescribed INTERNAL LOADING, shall be placed on four level pads which are in turn supported on a rigid horizotal surface, one under each bottom corner fitting or equivalent corner structure. The pads shall be centralized under the fittings and shall be of approximately the same plan dimensions as the fittings.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| Such as to subject each of the four top corner fittings to a vertical downward force equal to 1 x 1.8 x the allowable superimposed static stacking weight.  | Each EXTERNALLY APPLIED FORCE shall be applied to each of the corner fittings through a corresponding test corner fitting or through a pad of the same plan dimensions. The test corner fitting or pad shall be offset with respect to the top corner fitting of the container by 25 mm (1 in.) laterally and 38 mm (1J in.) longitudinally.  |
| 3. CONCENTRATED LOADS  |
| --- | (a) ON ROOF  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| None.  | --- |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| A concentrated load of 300 kg (660 lb) uniformly distributed over an area of 600 mm x 300 mm (24 in. x 12 in.).  | The EXTERNALLY APPLIED FORCES shall be applied vertically downwards to the outer surface of the weakest area of the roof of the container.  |
| 3. CONCENTRATED LOADS  |
| --- | (b) ON FLOOR  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| Two concentrated loads each of 2,730 kg (6,000 lb.) and each applied to the container floor through a contact area of 142 cm <sup>2</sup> (22 sq.in.)  | The test should be made with the container resting on four level supports under its four bottom corners in such a manner that the base structure of the container is free to deflect.  |
| --- | A testing device loaded to a weight of 5,460 kilogrammes (12,000 lbs.) that is 2,730 kg (6,000 lbs.) on each of two surfaces having, when loaded, a total contact area of 284 cm <sup>2</sup> (44 sq.in.) that is 142 cm <sup>2</sup> (22 sq.in.) on each surface, the surface width being 180 mm (7 in.) spaced 760 mm (30 in.) apart, centre to centre, should be manoeuvred over the entire floor area of the container.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| None.  | --- |
| 4. TRANSVERCE RACKING  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| None.  | The container in tare condition shall be placed on four level supports one under each bottom corner and shall be restrained against lateral and vertical movement by means of anchor devices so arranged that the lateral restraint is provided only at the bottom corners diagonally opposite to those at which the forces are applied.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| Such as to rack the end structures of the container sideways. The forces shall be equal to those for which the container was designed.  | The EXTERNALLY APPLIED FORCES shall be applied either separately or simultaneously to each of the top corner fittings on one side of the container in lines parallel both to the base and to the planes of the ends of the container. The forces shall be applied first towards and then away from the top corner fittings. In the case of containers in which each end is symmetrical about its own vertical centreline, one side only need be tested, but both sides of containers with asymmetric ends shall be tested.  |
| 5. LONGITUDINAL RESTRAINT (STATIC TEST)  |
| When designing and constructing containers, it must be borne in mind that containers, when carried by inland modes of transport may sustain accelerations of 2 g applied horizontally in a longitudinal direction.  | --- |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| A uniformly distributed load, such that the combined weight of a container and test load is equal to the maximum operating gross weight or rating, R. In the case of a tank container, when the weight of the internal load plus the tare is less than the maximum gross weight or rating, R, a supplementary load is to be applied to the container.  | The container having the prescribed INTERNAL LOADING shall be restrained longitudinally by securing the two bottom corner fittings or equivalent corner structures at one end to suitable anchor points.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| Such as to subject each side of the container to longitudinal compressive and tensile forces of magnitude R, that is, a combined force of 2R on the base of the container as a whole  | The EXTERNALLY APPLIED FORCES shall be applied first towards and then away from the anchor points. Each side of the container shall be tested.  |
| 6. END-WALLS  |
| The end-walls should be capable of withstanding a load of not less than 0.4 times the maximum permissible payload. If, however, the end-walls are designed to withstand a load of less or greater than 0.4 times the maximum permissible payload such a strength factor shall be indicated on the Safety Approval Plate in accordance with Annex I, Regulation 1.  |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| Such as to subject the inside of an end-wall to a uniformly distributed load of 0.4P or such other load for which the container may be designed.  | The prescribed INTERNAL LOADING shall be applied as follows: Both ends of a container shall be tested except where the ends are identical only one end need be tested. The end-walls of containers which do not have open sides or side doors may be tested separately or simultaneously.  |
| --- | The end-walls of containers which do have open sides or side doors should be tested separately. When the ends are tested separately the reactions to the forces applied to the end-wall shall be confined to the base structure of the container.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| None.  | --- |
| 7. SIDE-WALLS  |
| The side-walls should be capable of withstanding a load of not less than 0.6 times the maximum permissible payload. If, however, the side-walls are designed to withstand a load of less or greater than 0.6 times the maximum permissible payload, such a strength factor shall be indicated on the Safety Approval Plate in accordance with Annex I, Regulation 1.  | --- |
|  *Internal loading:*   | --- |
| Such as to subject the inside of a side-wall to a uniformly distributed load of 0.6P or such other load for which the container may be designed.  | The prescribed INTERNAL LOADING shall be applied as follows: Both sides of a container shall be tested except where the sides are identical only one side need be tested. Side-walls shall be tested separately and the reactions to the internal loading shall be confined to the corner fittings or equivalent corner structures. Open topped containers shall be tested in the condition in which they are designed to be operated, for example, with removable top members in position.  |
|  *Externally applied forces:*   | --- |
| None.  | --- |

### Artikel  IV  

####Beproeving, inspectie, goedkeuring en onderhoud

1.  Voor het doen naleven van de bepalingen van Bijlage I dient elke Administratie een doeltreffende procedure vast te stellen voor het beproeven, inspecteren en goedkeuren van containers overeenkomstig de in deze Overeenkomst vastgelegde normen, met dien verstande evenwel dat een Administratie dit beproeven, inspecteren en goedkeuren mag toevertrouwen aan daartoe naar behoren gemachtigde organisaties.   
2.  Een Administratie die dit beproeven, inspecteren en goedkeuren toevertrouwt aan een organisatie, geeft hiervan kennis aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Intergouvernementele Maritieme Consultatieve Organisatie ter mededeling aan de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen.   
3.  Aanvragen voor goedkeuring kunnen worden gericht tot de Administratie van elke Overeenkomstsluitende Partij.   
4.  Elke container dient in een veilige staat te worden gehouden overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage I.   
5.  Indien een goedgekeurde container in feite niet voldoet aan de voorschriften van de Bijlagen I en II, dient de betrokken Administratie de door haar noodzakelijk geachte maatregelen te nemen opdat de container alsnog gaat voldoen aan die voorschriften, of de goedkeuring in te trekken.   

### Artikel  V  

####Aanvaarding van goedkeuring

1.  Goedkeuring onder het gezag van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, verleend krachtens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, wordt door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen aanvaard voor alle in deze Overeenkomst vermelde doeleinden. Deze goedkeuring wordt door de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen beschouwd dezelfde kracht te hebben als een door hen verleende goedkeuring.   
2.  Een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij mag geen andere veiligheidseisen betreffende de constructie of beproevingen van containers voorschrijven dan die waarin door deze Overeenkomst wordt voorzien, met dien verstande evenwel dat niets in deze Overeenkomst de toepassing uitsluit van bepalingen van nationale voorschriften of wetten of van internationale overeenkomsten, die aanvullende veiligheidseisen betreffende de constructie of beproevingen voorschrijven van containers, die speciaal zijn ontworpen voor het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen of van voorzieningen die uitsluitend gelden voor containers voor vervoer van vloeistoffen in bulk of voor containers gebruikt voor luchtvervoer. De term „gevaarlijke stoffen” heeft hier de betekenis die daaraan in internationale overeenkomsten wordt gegeven.   

### Artikel  VI  

####Controle

1.  Elke container die is goedgekeurd op grond van artikel III is op het grondgebied van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen onderworpen aan controle door ambtenaren die daartoe naar behoren zijn gemachtigd door de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen. Deze controle is beperkt tot het nagaan of de container voorzien is van een geldig veiligheidskeurmerk, zoals dat op grond van deze Overeenkomst is vereist, tenzij er voldoende redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat de toestand van de container zodanig is dat een kennelijk veiligheidsrisico ontstaat. In dat geval moet de met de controle belaste ambtenaar deze controle slechts uitvoeren voor zover noodzakelijk om zeker te stellen dat de container weer in een veilige staat wordt gebracht alvorens hij verder wordt gebruikt.   
2.  Wanneer een container onveilig blijkt te zijn geworden als gevolg van een gebrek, dat kan hebben bestaan toen de container werd goedgekeurd, dient de voor die goedkeuring verantwoordelijke Administratie te worden ingelicht door de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die het gebrek ontdekte.

### Bijlage  II  

####Vereisten en proeven inzake structurele veiligheid

### *Inleiding* 

Bij het vaststellen van de vereisten in deze Bijlage is men ervan uitgegaan dat in alle fasen van behandeling van containers de krachten ten gevolge van beweging, plaatsing, stapeling en gewicht van de beladen container, alsook de krachten van buitenaf, de ontwerpsterkte van de container niet te boven zullen gaan. In het bijzonder is uitgegaan van de volgende veronderstellingen: 

a) de container dient zodanig vastgezet te zijn dat hij niet wordt onderworpen aan grotere krachten dan waarvoor hij is ontworpen;  

b) de container dient te zijn beladen overeenkomstig de aanbevolen gebruiken van het vak, opdat de lading de container niet onderwerpt aan grotere krachten dan waarvoor hij is ontworpen.   
### *Constructie* 

1. Een container gemaakt uit geschikt materiaal die op bevredigende wijze de volgende proeven doorstaat zonder duurzame vervorming of afwijking te ondergaan waardoor het niet mogelijk zou zijn hem te gebruiken voor het doel waarvoor hij is ontworpen, wordt als veilig beschouwd.  

2. De afmetingen, plaats en de daarmee samenhangende tolerantie van de hoekstukken dienen te worden gecontroleerd, met inachtneming van de hijs- en vastzetsystemen waarin zij zullen functioneren.   
### *Belasting en procedure bij de beproeving* 

Naar gelang het ontwerp van de container zulks toelaat, dienen voor alle te beproeven containers de onderstaande belasting en procedures bij de beproeving te worden gebruikt:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| BEPROEVINGSBELASTING EN TOEGEPASTE KRACHTEN  | BEPROEVINGSPROCEDURES  |
| 1. HIJSEN  |
| De container met de voorgeschreven inwendige belasting wordt zodanig opgehesen dat er geen versnellingskrachten van betekenis ontstaan. Na het ophijsen dient de container gedurende vijf minuten te blijven hangen of te worden gesteund en dan neergezet op de grond.  | --- |
|  *(A) HET HIJSEN GEBRUIKMAKEND VAN DE HOEKSTUKKEN*   |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | (i) *Hijsen vanuit de bovenhoekstukken:*  |
| Een zodanig uniform verdeelde belasting dat het gecombineerde gewicht van de container en de beproevingsbelasting gelijk is aan 2R. Bij een tankcontainer dient, wanneer het proefgewicht van de inwendige belasting te samen met de tarra minder is dan 2R, een aanvullende belasting verdeeld over de lengte van de tank op de container te worden aangebracht.  | Op containers langer dan 3000 mm (10 ft) (nominaal) dienen de hijskrachten verticaal te worden uitgeoefend op alle vier bovenhoekstukken. Op containers van 3000 mm (10 ft) (nominaal) lengte of minder dienen op alle vier bovenhoekstukken krachten te worden uitgeoefend zodanig dat de hoek tussen elk part van het hijsgereedschap en de verticaal 30° beloopt.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | (ii) *Hijsen gebruikmakend van de bodemhoekstukken:*  |
| Zodanig dat het gezamenlijke gewicht van 2R wordt opgehesen op de voorgeschreven wijze (onder het hoofd BEPROEVINGSPROCEDURES).  | Er dienen op zodanige wijze hijskrachten op de containers te worden uitgeoefend, dat de parts van het gereedschap alleen trekken aan de bodemhoekstukken. De hijskrachten dienen te worden uitgeoefend in een hoek met het horizontale vlak van:  |
| --- | 30° voor containers met een lengte van 12.000 mm (40 ft) (nominaal) of meer;  37° voor containers met een lengte van 9000 mm (30 ft) (nominaal) en tot, doch met uitsluiting van, 12.000 mm (40 ft) (nominaal);  45° voor containers met een lengte van 6000 mm (20 ft) (nominaal) en tot, doch met uitsluiting van, 9000 mm (30 ft) (nominaal);  60° voor containers minder dan 6000 mm (20 ft) (nominaal).  |
|  *(B) HIJSEN VOLGENS ANDERE AANVULLENDE METHODEN*   |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | (i) *Heffen met behulp van lepelsleuven:*  |
| Een zodanig uniform verdeelde belasting dat het gecombineerde gewicht van de container en de beproevingsbelasting gelijk is aan 1,25 R. Bij een tankcontainer dient, wanneer het proefgewicht van de inwendige belasting te samen met de tarra minder is dan 1,25R een aanvullende belasting verdeeld over de lengte van de tank op de container te worden aangebracht.  | De container dient te worden geplaatst op staven die zich in hetzelfde horizontale vlak bevinden, met een staaf geschoven in elke lepelsleuf die wordt gebruikt voor het heffen van de beladen container.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | De staven dienen dezelfde breedte te hebben als de lepels bestemd voor gebruik bij het hanteren van de container en dienen voor 75% van de lengte van de lepelsleuf daarin te steken.  |
| Zodanig dat het gecombineerde gewicht van 1,25 R wordt opgehesen op de voorgeschreven wijze (onder het hoofd BEPROEVINGSPROCEDURES).  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | (ii) *Hijsen met behulp van aangrijpingspunten voor hijsarmen:*  |
| Een zodanig uniform verdeelde belasting dat het gecombineerde gewicht van de container en de beproevingsbelasting gelijk is aan 1,25 R.  | De container dient te worden geplaatst op steunblokjes waarvan de bovenzijden zich in hetzelfde horizontale vlak bevinden, met een blokje onder elk aangrijpingspunt voor de hijsarmen. Deze steunblokjes dienen dezelfde grootte te hebben als het aangrijpingsoppervlak van de te gebruiken punten.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   |
| Zodanig dat het gezamenlijke gewicht van 1,25 R wordt opgehesen op de voorgeschreven wijze (onder het hoofd BEPROEVINGSPROCEDURES).  |
| --- | (iii) *Andere methoden*  |
| --- | Wanneer containers zo zijn ontworpen dat zij in beladen toestand moeten worden opgehesen volgens een niet in (A) of (B) (i) en (ii) genoemde methode, dienen zij tevens te worden beproefd met de in- en uitwendige belasting die representatief is voor de aan die methode eigen verversnellingswaarden.  |
| 2. STAPELEN  |
| 1. Wanneer bij internationaal vervoer de omstandigheden zodanig zijn dat de maximale verticale versnellingskrachten aanmerkelijk afwijken van 1,8 g en wanneer het gebruik van de container op betrouwbare en doeltreffende wijze is beperkt tot zodanige vervoersomstandigheden, mag het stapelgewicht worden aangepast aan de bijbehorende versnellingskrachten.  |
| 2. Na geslaagde voltooiing van deze beproeving kan het toelaatbare statische stapelgewicht op de bovenzijde van de container worden bepaald, dat dient te worden aangegeven op de veiligheidskeurplaat in de rubriek „toelaatbaar stapelgewicht voor 1,8 g (in kg en lb)“.  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Een zodanig uniform verdeelde belasting dat het gecombineerde gewicht van de container en de beproevingsbelasting gelijk is aan 1,8 R. Tankcontainers mogen in lege toestand worden beproefd.  | De container met de voorgeschreven inwendige belasting wordt geplaatst op vier horizontale steunblokjes die op hun beurt steunen op een niet vervormbaar horizontaal oppervlak, één blokje onder elk bodemhoekstuk of gelijkwaardige hoekstructuur. De steunblokjes dienen midden onder de hoekstukken te worden geplaatst en ongeveer dezelfde oppervlaktematen als de hoekstukken te hebben.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Zodanig dat zij elk van de vier bovenhoekstukken onderwerpen aan een verticale neerwaartse kracht gelijk aan 1/4 x 1,8 x het toelaatbare statische stapelgewicht.  | Elke uitwendige belasting dient te worden uitgeoefend op elk van de hoekstukken door middel van een overeenkomstig beproevingshoekstuk of door middel van een steunblokje met dezelfde oppervlaktematen. De plaatsing van het beproevingshoekstuk of het steunblokje ten opzichte van het bovenhoekstuk van de container dient een afwijking te hebben van 25 mm in zijdelingse- en 38 mm in de lengterichting.  |
| 3. PUNTBELASTING  |

| Twee geconcentreerde belastingen van elk 2730 kg, ieder op de containervloer aangebracht over een oppervlak van 142 cm <sup>2</sup>.  | De beproeving dient te geschieden met de container rustend op vier steunen waarvan de bovenzijden in één horizontaal vlak liggen onder zijn vier bodemhoeken, op zodanige wijze dat de structuur van het bodemraam van de container vrij kan buigen. Er dient een beproevingsapparaat over het gehele vloeroppervlak van de container te worden bewogen. Dit apparaat dient te voldoen aan de volgende kenmerken: beladen tot een gewicht van 5460 kg, d.w.z. 2730 kg op elk van de twee oppervlakken, dus in beladen staat met een totaal raakvlak van 284 cm <sup>2</sup>, 142 cm <sup>2</sup> op elk oppervlak, met een breedte van 180 mm op onderlinge afstand van 760 mm van hart tot hart.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Geen.  | --- |
| 4. TORSIEBEPROEVING  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Geen.  | De lege container dient te worden geplaatst op vier steunen waarvan de bovenzijden in één horizontaal vlak liggen, één onder elke bodemhoek, en hij dient te worden vastgezet zodat hij zich niet kan verplaatsen; de bevestigingsmiddelen dienen zo te worden aangebracht dat de zijwaartse beweging alleen wordt verhinderd aan de bodemhoeken gelegen diagonaal tegenover de hoeken waarop de krachten worden uitgeoefend.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Zodanig dat aan de kopstructuren van de container zijwaarts wordt getrokken en geduwd. De krachten dienen gelijk te zijn aan die waarvoor de container werd ontworpen.  | De uitwendige belasting dient te worden uitgeoefend - afzonderlijk of gelijktijdig - op elk van de bovenhoekstukken aan de ene zijde van de container in lijnen evenwijdig aan zowel het grondvlak als aan de kopvlakken van de container. De krachten dienen eerst naar de bovenhoekstukken toe en daarna van de bovenhoekstukken af te worden uitgeoefend. In het geval van containers waarbij elk uiteinde symmetrisch is ten opzichte van zijn eigen verticale hartlijn, behoeft slechts één zijde te worden beproefd, maar bij containers met asymmetrische koppen dienen beide zijden te worden beproefd.  |
| 5. WEERSTAND TEGEN VERVORMING IN DE LENGTERICHTING (STATISCHE TEST)  |
| Bij het ontwerpen en vervaardigen van containers dient men zich ervan bewust te zijn dat containers bij vervoer over land onderworpen kunnen worden aan versnellingen van 2 g, horizontaal in de lengterichting.  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Een zodanig gelijkmatig verdeelde belasting, dat het gecombineerde gewicht van de container en de beproevingsbelasting gelijk is aan het maximum brutogewicht of de gebruikslimiet R. Bij een tankcontainer dient, wanneer het gewicht van de inwendige belasting te zamen met het ledig gewicht minder is dan het maximaal brutogewicht of de gebruikslimiet R, een aanvullende belasting op de container te worden aangebracht.  | De container met de voorgeschreven inwendige belasting dient in de lengterichting te worden vastgezet door de twee bodemhoekstukken of gelijkwaardige hoekstructuren aan één einde vast te maken aan geschikte verankeringspunten.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | --- |

Elke zijde van de container dient te worden beproefd.  |
| 6. KOPWANDEN  |
| De kopwanden dienen een belasting te kunnen weerstaan van niet minder dan 0,4 maal het maximaal toelaatbaar laadvermogen. Indien de kopwanden evenwel zo zijn ontworpen dat zij een belasting van minder of meer dan 0,4 maal het maximum toelaatbaar laadvermogen kunnen weerstaan, dient een zodanige sterktefactor te worden aangegeven op de veiligheidskeurplaat overeenkomstig Bijlage I, Bepaling 1.  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Zodanig dat de kopwand van binnen wordt onderworpen aan een gelijkmatig verdeelde belasting van 0,4 P of aan zodanige andere belasting waarvoor de container is ontworpen.  | De voorgeschreven inwendige belasting dient als volgt te worden aangebracht: beide uiteinden van een container dienen te worden beproefd, behalve wanneer de uiteinden identiek zijn; in dat geval behoeft slechts één uiteinde te worden beproefd. De kopwanden van containers die geen open zijden of zijdeuren hebben kunnen afzonderlijk of gelijktijdig worden beproefd.  |
| --- | De kopwanden van containers die open zijden of zijdeuren hebben, dienen afzonderlijk te worden beproefd. Wanneer de kopwanden afzonderlijk worden beproefd, mag de reactie van de op de kopwand uitgeoefende krachten slechts worden opgenomen door de structuur van het bodemraam van de container.  |
|  *Uitwendige belasting:*   | --- |
| Geen.  | --- |
| 7. ZIJWANDEN  |
| De zijwanden dienen een belasting van niet minder dan 0,6 maal het maximaal toelaatbaar laadvermogen te kunnen weerstaan. Indien de zijwanden evenwel zo zijn ontworpen dat zij een belasting kleiner of groter dan 0,6 maal het maximaal toelaatbaar laadvermogen kunnen weerstaan, dan dient een zodanige sterktefactor te worden aangegeven op de veiligheidskeurplaat overeenkomstig Bijlage I, Bepaling 1.  |
|  *Inwendige belasting:*   | --- |
