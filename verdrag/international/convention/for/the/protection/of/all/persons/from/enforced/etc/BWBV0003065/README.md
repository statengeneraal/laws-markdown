Preamble The States Parties to this Convention, Considering the obligation of States under the [Charter of the United Nations](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/charter/of/the/united/nations/BWBV0004143/README.md) to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms, Having regard to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/universal/declaration/of/human/rights/BWBV0001008/README.md), Recalling the [International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/covenant/on/economic/social/and/cultural/rights/BWBV0001016/README.md), the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/covenant/on/civil/and/political/rights/BWBV0001017/README.md) and the other relevant international instruments in the fields of human rights, humanitarian law and international criminal law, Also recalling the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, Aware of the extreme seriousness of enforced disappearance, which constitutes a crime and, in certain circumstances defined in international law, a crime against humanity, Determined to prevent enforced disappearances and to combat impunity for the crime of enforced disappearance, Considering the right of any person not to be subjected to enforced disappearance, the right of victims to justice and to reparation, Affirming the right of any victim to know the truth about the circumstances of an enforced disappearance and the fate of the disappeared person, and the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information to this end,   Have agreed on the following articles:     
### PART  I  

### Article  1  

1.  No one shall be subjected to enforced disappearance.   
2.  No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance.

### Article  2  

For the purposes of this Convention, “enforced disappearance” is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law. 

### Article  3  

Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to investigate acts defined in article 2 committed by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State and to bring those responsible to justice. 

### Article  4  

Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its criminal law. 

### Article  5  

The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law. 

### Article  6  

1.  Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to hold criminally responsible at least: 

a) Any person who commits, orders, solicits or induces the commission of, attempts to commit, is an accomplice to or participates in an enforced disappearance;  

b) A superior who: 

(i) Knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that subordinates under his or her effective authority and control were committing or about to commit a crime of enforced disappearance;  

(ii) Exercised effective responsibility for and control over activities which were concerned with the crime of enforced disappearance; and  

(iii) Failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to prevent or repress the commission of an enforced disappearance or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for investigation and prosecution;    

c) Subparagraph (b) above is without prejudice to the higher standards of responsibility applicable under relevant international law to a military commander or to a person effectively acting as a military commander.     
2.  No order or instruction from any public authority, civilian, military or other, may be invoked to justify an offence of enforced disappearance.  

### Article  7  

1.  Each State Party shall make the offence of enforced disappearance punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its extreme seriousness.   
2.  Each State Party may establish: 

a) Mitigating circumstances, in particular for persons who, having been implicated in the commission of an enforced disappearance, effectively contribute to bringing the disappeared person forward alive or make it possible to clarify cases of enforced disappearance or to identify the perpetrators of an enforced disappearance;  

b) Without prejudice to other criminal procedures, aggravating circumstances, in particular in the event of the death of the disappeared person or the commission of an enforced disappearance in respect of pregnant women, minors, persons with disabilities or other particularly vulnerable persons.    

### Article  8  

Without prejudice to article 5,

b) Commences from the moment when the offence of enforced disappearance ceases, taking into account its continuous nature.    

2. Each State Party shall guarantee the right of victims of enforced disappearance to an effective remedy during the term of limitation.   

### Article  9  

1.  Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance: 

a) When the offence is committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;  

b) When the alleged offender is one of its nationals;  

c) When the disappeared person is one of its nationals and the State Party considers it appropriate.     
2.  Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction, unless it extradites or surrenders him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrenders him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized.   
3.  This Convention does not exclude any additional criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law.  

### Article  10  

1.  Upon being satisfied, after an examination of the information available to it, that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in whose territory a person suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance is present shall take him or her into custody or take such other legal measures as are necessary to ensure his or her presence. The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided for in the law of that State Party but may be maintained only for such time as is necessary to ensure the person’s presence at criminal, surrender or extradition proceedings.   
2.  A State Party which has taken the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall immediately carry out a preliminary inquiry or investigations to establish the facts. It shall notify the States Parties referred to in article 9, paragraph 1, of the measures it has taken in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this article, including detention and the circumstances warranting detention, and of the findings of its preliminary inquiry or its investigations, indicating whether it intends to exercise its jurisdiction.   
3.  Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article may communicate immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he or she is a national, or, if he or she is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he or she usually resides.  

### Article  11  

1.  The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found shall, if it does not extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrender him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.   
2.  These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State Party. In the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 1.   
3.  Any person against whom proceedings are brought in connection with an offence of enforced disappearance shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings. Any person tried for an offence of enforced disappearance shall benefit from a fair trial before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law.  

### Article  12  

1.  Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the competent authorities, which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially and, where necessary, undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation. Appropriate steps shall be taken, where necessary, to ensure that the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person and their defence counsel, as well as persons participating in the investigation, are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given.   
2.  Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance, the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall undertake an investigation, even if there has been no formal complaint.   
3.  Each State Party shall ensure that the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article: 

a) Have the necessary powers and resources to conduct the investigation effectively, including access to the documentation and other information relevant to their investigation;  

b) Have access, if necessary with the prior authorization of a judicial authority, which shall rule promptly on the matter, to any place of detention or any other place where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the disappeared person may be present.     
4.  Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and sanction acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation. It shall ensure in particular that persons suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or reprisal aimed at the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person or their defence counsel, or at persons participating in the investigation.  

### Article  13  

1.  For the purposes of extradition between States Parties, the offence of enforced disappearance shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition based on such an offence may not be refused on these grounds alone.   
2.  The offence of enforced disappearance shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention.   
3.  States Parties undertake to include the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty subsequently to be concluded between them.   
4.  If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as the necessary legal basis for extradition in respect of the offence of enforced disappearance.   
5.  States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence between themselves.   
6.  Extradition shall, in all cases, be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, in particular, conditions relating to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition or make it subject to certain conditions.   
7.  Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, political opinions or membership of a particular social group, or that compliance with the request would cause harm to that person for any one of these reasons.  

### Article  14  

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual legal assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of an offence of enforced disappearance, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal that is necessary for the proceedings.   
2.  Such mutual legal assistance shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable treaties on mutual legal assistance, including, in particular, the conditions in relation to the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse to grant mutual legal assistance or may make it subject to conditions.  

### Article  15  

States Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual assistance with a view to assisting victims of enforced disappearance, and in searching for, locating and releasing disappeared persons and, in the event of death, in exhuming and identifying them and returning their remains. 

### Article  16  

1.  No State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”), surrender or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to enforced disappearance.   
2.  For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations, including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights or of serious violations of international humanitarian law.  

### Article  17  

1.  No one shall be held in secret detention.   
2.  Without prejudice to other international obligations of the State Party with regard to the deprivation of liberty, each State Party shall, in its legislation:

e) Guarantee access by the competent and legally authorized authorities and institutions to the places where persons are deprived of liberty, if necessary with prior authorization from a judicial authority;

3.  Each State Party shall assure the compilation and maintenance of one or more up-to-date official registers and/or records of persons deprived of liberty, which shall be made promptly available, upon request, to any judicial or other competent authority or institution authorized for that purpose by the law of the State Party concerned or any relevant international legal instrument to which the State concerned is a party.

5.  Indien een lid van het Comité overlijdt, terugtreedt of om een andere reden niet langer zijn of haar taken voor het Comité kan vervullen, benoemt de Staat die Partij is die hem of haar had voorgedragen, in overeenstemming met de criteria vervat in het eerste lid van dit artikel, een andere kandidaat uit zijn onderdanen voor het resterende deel van zijn of haar termijn op voorwaarde van goedkeuring door de meerderheid van de Staten die Partij zijn. Deze goedkeuring wordt geacht te zijn verkregen, tenzij de helft of meer van de Staten die Partij zijn, binnen zes weken nadat zij door de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties van de voorgestelde benoeming in kennis zijn gesteld, afwijzend reageren.   
6.  Het Comité stelt zijn eigen reglement van orde vast.   
7.  De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties voorziet het Comité van de nodige middelen, personeel en voorzieningen ten behoeve van de doeltreffende uitvoering van zijn taken. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties roept de eerste vergadering van het Comité bijeen.
