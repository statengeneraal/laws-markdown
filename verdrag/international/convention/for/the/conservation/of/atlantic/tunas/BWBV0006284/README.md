In dat geval mag elke andere verdragsluitende partij een bezwaar indienen vóór het einde van deze aanvullende termijn van zestig dagen, of binnen vijfenveertig dagen na de datum van kennisgeving van een bezwaar door een andere verdragsluitende partij binnen deze aanvullende termijn van zestig dagen, indien deze termijn later eindigt.  

c. De aanbeveling treedt in werking na afloop van de voor het indienen van bezwaren verlengde termijn of termijnen, uitgezonderd voor de verdragsluitende partijen die bezwaar hebben aangetekend.  

d. Indien een aanbeveling echter een bezwaar heeft opgeleverd, overeenkomstig de onderdelen a en b, ingediend door slechts één of minder dan een kwart van de verdragsluitende partijen, stelt de Commissie de verdragsluitende partij of partijen die het bezwaar heeft of hebben ingediend er onmiddellijk van in kennis dat het bezwaar geacht wordt geen effect te hebben.  

e. In het in onderdeel d bedoelde geval kan de verdragsluitende partij of kunnen partijen hun bezwaar bevestigen binnen een aanvullende termijn van zestig dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum van bedoelde kennisgeving. Na afloop van deze termijn treedt de aanbeveling in werking, behalve ten aanzien van de verdragsluitende partij die een bezwaar heeft ingediend en het bezwaar binnen de voorziene termijn heeft bevestigd.  

f. Indien een aanbeveling bezwaar heeft opgeleverd van meer dan een kwart, maar minder dan de meerderheid van de verdragsluitende partijen overeenkomstig de onderdelen a en b, treedt de aanbeveling in werking ten aanzien van de verdragsluitende partijen die geen bezwaar hebben ingediend.  

g. Indien een meerderheid van verdragsluitende partijen bezwaar heeft aangetekend, treedt de aanbeveling niet in werking.     
4.  Elke verdragsluitende partij die een bezwaar tegen een aanbeveling heeft ingediend, kan het bezwaar te allen tijde intrekken, en de aanbeveling wordt ten aanzien van de betrokken verdragsluitende partij onmiddellijk van kracht, indien zij reeds in werking is getreden of op de datum van inwerkingtreding krachtens dit artikel.5. De Commissie stelt elke verdragsluitende partij onmiddellijk in kennis van de ontvangst van een bezwaar en van elke intrekking van een bezwaar, alsmede van de datum van inwerkingtreding van elke aanbeveling.

3.  De verdragsluitende partijen verbinden zich ertoe met elkaar samen te werken om gepaste adequate maatregelen vast te stellen om de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag te waarborgen en met name een internationaal controlesysteem in te stellen voor toepassing in het verdragsgebied, met uitzondering van de territoriale zee en eventuele andere wateren waar een staat op grond van het internationaal recht rechtsmacht over de visserij mag uitoefenen.   

### Artikel  X   
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

<sup> 1)  Zoals gewijzigd bij het Protocol van Madrid, dat op 10 maart 2005 in werking trad.  </sup>  
1.  De Commissie stelt een begroting vast voor haar gezamenlijke uitgaven voor de periode van twee jaar na elke gewone zitting.   
2.  Elke verdragsluitende partij draagt jaarlijks een bedrag af voor de begroting van de Commissie dat wordt berekend aan de hand van een schema voorzien in het financieel reglement, zoals door de Commissie aangenomen. Bij het aannemen van dit schema dient de Commissie onder andere rekening te houden met de vaste basisbedragen voor het lidmaatschap van de Commissie en de werkgroepen, de som van het levend gewicht en het nettogewicht van de geproduceerde conserven van Atlantische tonijn en tonijnachtigen en de economische ontwikkeling van de verdragsluitende partijen. Het schema van jaarlijkse bijdragen in het financieel reglement wordt uitsluitend vastgesteld of gewijzigd na overeenstemming met alle verdragsluitende partijen die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen. De verdragsluitende partijen worden hiervan negentig dagen van tevoren in kennis gesteld.   
3.  De Raad onderzoekt de tweede helft van de tweejarige begroting tijdens zijn gewone zitting, die plaatsvindt tussen twee zittingen van de Commissie, en kan, op grond van de situatie op dat ogenblik en de verwachte ontwikkelingen, binnen de door de Commissie vastgestelde totale begroting een herverdeling toestaan van de voor het tweede jaar in de begroting opgenomen bedragen.   
4.  De uitvoerend secretaris van de Commissie stelt elke verdragsluitende partij in kennis van haar jaarlijkse bijdrage. De bijdragen zijn verschuldigd op 1 januari van het jaar waarop zij betrekking hebben. De bijdragen die niet voor 1 januari van het daaropvolgende jaar zijn betaald, worden als achterstallige bijdragen beschouwd.   
5.  De bijdragen voor de tweejarige begroting worden betaald in de door de Commissie vastgestelde munteenheid.   
6.  De Commissie stelt tijdens haar eerste zitting een begroting op voor het resterende gedeelte van het eerste jaar waarin zij in functie is en voor de daaropvolgende periode van twee jaar. Zij zendt de verdragsluitende partijen onverwijld een afschrift van deze begrotingen toe en stelt hen in kennis van hun respectieve bijdragen voor het eerste jaar.   
7.  Voor de daaropvolgende jaren zendt de uitvoerend secretaris ten minste zestig dagen vóór de gewone zitting van de Commissie die voorafgaat aan de tweejarige periode, aan elke verdragsluitende partij een ontwerpbegroting en een schema van de voorgestelde bijdragen toe.   
8.  De Commissie kan het stemrecht van een verdragsluitende partij schorsen indien de achterstallige bijdrage van die partij gelijk is aan of hoger dan de door de verdragsluitende partij verschuldigde bijdrage voor de voorgaande twee jaar.   
9.  De Commissie vormt een fonds waarin het werkkapitaal wordt ondergebracht voor de financiering van haar werkzaamheden in afwachting van de ontvangst van de jaarlijkse bijdragen en voor andere door haar vast te stellen doeleinden. De Commissie stelt de omvang van het fonds vast, maakt een raming van de voor de vorming van dit fonds benodigde voorschotten en neemt regels aan voor de aanwending van het fonds.   
10.  De Commissie treft maatregelen voor een jaarlijkse onafhankelijke controle van haar rekeningen. De verslagen daarvan worden onderzocht en goedgekeurd door de Commissie of door de Raad in de jaren waarin geen gewone zitting van de Commissie wordt gehouden.   
11.  De Commissie kan voor de uitvoering van haar werkzaamheden andere dan de in het tweede lid bedoelde bijdragen aanvaarden.   

### Artikel  XI   
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

1.  De verdragsluitende partijen komen overeen dat er een werkrelatie tussen de Commissie en de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties dient te zijn. Daartoe zal de Commissie in onderhandeling treden met de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties om een overeenkomst ingevolge artikel XIII van het Statuut van de organisatie te sluiten. In deze overeenkomst dient onder meer te worden bepaald dat de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties een vertegenwoordiger aanwijst die zonder stemrecht deelneemt aan alle zittingen van de Commissie en haar hulporganen. <sup> 2)  Zie het FAO-verdrag.  </sup>   
2.  De verdragsluitende partijen komen overeen dat er samenwerking dient te zijn tussen de Commissie en andere internationale visserijcommissies en wetenschappelijke organisaties die een bijdrage kunnen leveren aan haar werkzaamheden. De Commissie mag overeenkomsten met dergelijke commissies en organisaties sluiten.   
3.  De Commissie kan elke relevante internationale organisatie en elke regering die geen lid is van de Commissie, maar wel van de Verenigde Naties of van een gespecialiseerde organisatie van de Verenigde Naties, uitnodigen waarnemers af te vaardigen naar de zittingen van de Commissie en haar hulporganen.   

### Artikel  XII   
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

1.  Dit Verdrag blijft gedurende tien jaar van kracht en blijft daarna van kracht totdat een meerderheid van verdragsluitende partijen besluit het te beëindigen.

Elke verdragsluitende partij kan op elk tijdstip na een termijn van tien jaar, te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop dit Verdrag in werking is getreden, zich terugtrekken uit dit Verdrag per 31 december van een jaar, met inbegrip van het tiende jaar; daartoe dient op of voor 31 december van het voorgaande jaar een schriftelijke kennisgeving van terugtrekking te worden gericht aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties.   
3.  Elke andere verdragsluitende partij kan zich vervolgens per 31 december van hetzelfde jaar terugtrekken uit dit Verdrag; daartoe dient een schriftelijke kennisgeving van terugtrekking aan de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties te worden gericht binnen één maand na de datum waarop zij van de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties een bericht van terugtrekking heeft ontvangen, en in elk geval uiterlijk op 1 april van dat jaar.   

### Artikel  XIII   
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

1.  Elke verdragsluitende partij of de Commissie mag wijzigingen van dit Verdrag voorstellen. De Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties zendt alle verdragsluitende partijen een gewaarmerkt afschrift van de tekst van elke voorgestelde wijziging. Elke wijziging die geen nieuwe verplichtingen tot gevolg heeft, treedt voor alle verdragsluitende partijen in werking op de dertigste dag na aanvaarding van de wijziging door drie vierde van de verdragsluitende partijen. Elke wijziging die nieuwe verplichtingen tot gevolg heeft, treedt voor elke verdragsluitende partij die de wijziging heeft aanvaard, in werking op de negentigste dag na aanvaarding van de wijziging door drie vierde van de verdragsluitende partijen, en voor elke andere verdragsluitende partij op het tijdstip waarop zij die wijziging aanvaardt. Elke wijziging die naar de mening van een of meer verdragsluitende partijen nieuwe verplichtingen tot gevolg heeft, wordt als zodanig beschouwd en treedt in werking zoals hierboven bepaald. Een regering die verdragsluitende partij wordt nadat een wijziging van dit Verdrag is voorgelegd voor aanvaarding overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel is door het gewijzigde Verdrag gebonden zodra de betrokken wijziging in werking treedt.   
2.  Voorgestelde wijzigingen worden nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties. De kennisgevingen van aanvaarding van de wijzigingen worden nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties.   

### Artikel  XIV   
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

<sup> 3)  Zoals gewijzigd bij het Protocol van Parijs, dat op 14 december 1997 in werking trad.  </sup>  
1.  Dit Verdrag staat open voor ondertekening door de regering van elke staat die lid is van de Verenigde Naties of van één van haar gespecialiseerde organisaties. Elke in dit lid bedoelde regering die het Verdrag niet heeft ondertekend, kan te allen tijde tot het Verdrag toetreden.   
2.  Dit Verdrag dient te worden bekrachtigd of goedgekeurd door de ondertekenende landen in overeenstemming met hun grondwet. De akten van bekrachtiging, goedkeuring of toetreding worden nedergelegd bij de Directeur-Generaal van de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties.   
3.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking na het nederleggen van de akten van bekrachtiging, goedkeuring of toetreding door zeven regeringen; voor elke regering die later een akte van bekrachtiging, goedkeuring of toetreding nederlegt, treedt dit Verdrag in werking op de datum van nederlegging van de akte.   
4.  Dit Verdrag staat open voor ondertekening of toetreding door elke intergouvernementele organisatie voor economische integratie gevormd door staten die bevoegdheden aan de organisatie hebben overgedragen voor aangelegenheden waarop dit Verdrag betrekking heeft, met inbegrip van de bevoegdheid verdragen over deze aangelegenheden te sluiten.   
5.  Vanaf de nederlegging van haar akte van formele bevestiging of toetreding is elke in het vierde lid bedoelde organisatie verdragsluitende partij, die dezelfde rechten en verplichtingen op grond van de bepalingen van het Verdrag heeft als de andere verdragsluitende partijen. Verwijzingen in de tekst van het Verdrag naar het begrip „staat” in artikel IX, derde lid, en het begrip „regering” in de preambule en in artikel XIII, eerste lid, dienen in deze zin te worden begrepen.   
6.
