### Article  12

### Article  13  

####Criteria for fixing the reward

1.  The reward shall be fixed with a view to encouraging salvage operations, taking into account the following criteria without regard to the order in which they are presented below;

b) the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment;  

c) the measure of success obtained by the salvor;  

d) the nature and degree of the danger;

f) the time used and expenses and losses incurred by the salvors;  

g) the risk of liability and other risks run by the salvors or their equipment;  

h) the promptness of the services rendered;  

i) the availability and use of vessels or other equipment intended for salvage operations;  

j) the state of readiness and efficiency of the salvor's equipment and the value thereof.     
2.  Payment of a reward fixed according to paragraph 1 shall be made by all of the vessel and other property interests in proportion to their respective salved values. However, a State Party may in its national law provide that the payment of a reward has to be made by one of these interests, subject to a right of recourse of this interest against the other interests for their respective shares. Nothing in this article shall prevent any right of defence.   
3.  The rewards, exclusive of any interest and recoverable legal costs that may be payable thereon, shall not exceed the salved value of the vessel and other property.   

### Article  14  

####Special compensation

1.  If the salvor has carried out salvage operations in respect of a vessel which by itself or its cargo threatened damage to the environment and has failed to earn a reward under article 13 at least equivalent to the special compensation assessable in accordance with this article, he shall be entitled to special compensation from the owner of that vessel equivalent to his expenses as herein defined.   
2.  If, in the circumstances set out in paragraph 1, the salvor by his salvage operations has prevented or minimized damage to the environment, the special compensation payable by the owner to the salvor under paragraph 1 may be increased up to a maximum of 30% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. However, the tribunal, if it deems it fair and just to do so and bearing in mind the relevant criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1, may increase such special compensation further, but in no event shall the total increase be more than 100% of the expenses incurred by the salvor.   
3.  Salvor's expenses for the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 means the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment and personnel actually and reasonably used in the salvage operation, taking into consideration the criteria set out in article 13, paragraph l (h), (i) and (j).   
4.  The total special compensation under this article shall be paid only if and to the extent that such compensation is greater than any reward recoverable by the salvor under article 13.   
5.  If the salvor has been negligent and has thereby failed to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, he may be deprived of the whole or part of any special compensation due under this article.   
6.  Nothing in this article shall affect any right of recourse on the part of the owner of the vessel.   

### Article  15  

####Apportionment between salvors

1.  The apportionment of a reward under article 13 between salvors shall be made on the basis of the criteria contained in that article.   
2.  The apportionment between the owner, master and other persons in the service of each salving vessel shall be determined by the law of the flag of that vessel. If the salvage has not been carried out from a vessel, the apportionment shall be determined by the law governing the contract between the salvor and his servants.   

### Article  16  

####Salvage of persons

1.  No remuneration is due from persons whose lives are saved, but nothing in this article shall affect the provisions of national law on this subject.   
2.  A salvor of human life, who has taken part in the services rendered on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, is entitled to a fair share of the payment awarded to the salvor for salving the vessel or other property or preventing or minimizing damage to the environment.   

### Article  17  

####Services rendered under existing contracts

No payment is due under the provisions of this Convention unless the services rendered exceed what can be reasonably considered as due performance of a contract entered into before the danger arose.  

### Article  18  

####The effect of salvor's misconduct

A salvor may be deprived of the whole or part of the payment due under this Convention to the extent that the salvage operations have become necessary or more difficult because of fault or neglect on his part or if the salvor has been guilty of fraud or other dishonest conduct.  

### Article  19  

####Prohibition of salvage operations

Services rendered notwithstanding the express and reasonable prohibition of the owner or master of the vessel or the owner of any other property in danger which is not and has not been on board the vessel shall not give rise to payment under this Convention.

####Interim payment

1.  The tribunal having jurisdiction over the claim of the salvor may, by interim decision, order that the salvor shall be paid on account such amount as seems fair and just, and on such terms including terms as to security where appropriate, as may be fair and just according to the circumstances of the case.

### Artikel  13  

####Criteria voor het vaststellen van het hulploon

1.  Het hulploon wordt vastgesteld met het oog op het aanmoedigen van hulpverlening, rekening houdend met de volgende criteria ongeacht de volgorde waarin zij hieronder zijn opgesomd:

1.  Indien een hulpverlener hulp heeft verleend aan een schip dat zelf of wegens zijn lading schade dreigde toe te brengen aan het milieu en hij geen hulploon heeft verkregen krachtens artikel 13 dat ten minste gelijk is aan de volgens dit artikel vast te stellen bijzondere vergoeding, heeft hij recht op een bijzondere vergoeding van de zijde van de eigenaar van het schip, gelijk aan de door hem gemaakte kosten zoals in dit artikel omschreven.   
2.  Indien de hulpverlener in de in het eerste lid bedoelde omstandigheden door zijn hulpverleningswerkzaamheden schade aan het milieu heeft voorkomen of heeft beperkt, kan de door de eigenaar volgens het eerste lid aan de hulpverlener te betalen bijzondere vergoeding worden verhoogd tot een maximum van 30% van de door de hulpverlener gemaakte kosten. Indien echter het gerecht, rekening houdend met de in het eerste lid van artikel 13 genoemde criteria, zulks billijk en rechtvaardig acht, kan het die bijzondere vergoeding verder verhogen, maar de totale verhoging mag in geen geval meer bedragen dan 100% van de door de hulpverlener gemaakte kosten.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste en tweede lid worden onder kosten van de hulpverlener verstaan de contante uitgaven die door de hulpverlener redelijkerwijze zijn gemaakt bij de hulpverlening en een billijk tarief voor uitrusting en personeel die daadwerkelijk en redelijkerwijze zijn ingezet tijdens de hulpverlening, in aanmerking nemend de criteria genoemd in artikel 13, eerste lid, onder (h), (i) en (j).   
4.  De totale bijzondere vergoeding krachtens dit artikel wordt slechts betaald indien en voor zover deze vergoeding hoger is dan het hulploon dat de hulpverlener krachtens artikel 13 kan ontvangen.   
5.  Indien de hulpverlener nalatig is geweest en daardoor in gebreke is gebleven schade aan het milieu te voorkomen of te beperken, kan hem de krachtens dit artikel verschuldigde bijzondere vergoeding geheel of gedeeltelijk worden ontzegd.   
6.  Geen bepaling van dit artikel doet afbreuk aan enig recht van verhaal van de eigenaar van het schip.   

### Artikel  15  

####Verdeling tussen hulpverleners

1.  De verdeling van een in artikel 13 bedoeld hulploon tussen hulpverleners geschiedt volgens de in dat artikel genoemde criteria.   
2.  De verdeling tussen de eigenaar, de kapitein en de andere in dienst van ieder hulpverlenend schip staande personen wordt bepaald door het recht van de vlag van het schip. Indien de hulpverlening niet is verricht vanaf een schip, wordt de verdeling bepaald door het recht dat van toepassing is op de overeenkomst tussen de hulpverlener en zijn ondergeschikten.   

### Artikel  16  

####Redding van personen

1.  Geen hulploon is verschuldigd door personen wier leven is gered, maar dit artikel doet geen afbreuk aan bepalingen van nationaal recht betreffende dit onderwerp.   
2.  Degene die mensenlevens heeft gered en heeft deelgenomen aan de werkzaamheden die zijn verricht ter gelegenheid van het ongeval dat aanleiding heeft gegeven tot de hulpverlening, is gerechtigd tot een billijk aandeel in de betaling die aan de hulpverlener is toegekend voor de redding van het schip of andere zaken of voor het voorkomen of beperken van schade aan het milieu.   

### Artikel  17  

####Diensten die worden verleend krachtens bestaande overeenkomsten

Geen betaling is verschuldigd krachtens dit Verdrag tenzij de verleende diensten verder gaan dan wat redelijkerwijs kan worden aangemerkt als een gebruikelijke uitvoering vaneen overeenkomst die was gesloten voordat het gevaar ontstond.  

### Artikel  18  

####Gevolgen van het wangedrag van de hulpverlener

Aan een hulpverlener kan een krachtens dit Verdrag verschuldigde betaling geheel of gedeeltelijk worden ontzegd voor zover de hulpverlening noodzakelijk geworden of bemoeilijkt is door zijn fout of nalatigheid of de hulpverlener zich schuldig heeft gemaakt aan bedrog of ander oneerlijk gedrag.  

### Artikel  19  

####Verbod tot hulpverlening

Diensten, verleend niettegenstaande het uitdrukkelijke en redelijke verbod van de eigenaar of de kapitein van het schip of van de eigenaar van enige andere in gevaar verkerende zaak die zich niet aan boord van het schip bevindt of heeft bevonden, geven geen recht op een betaling krachtens dit Verdrag.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####VORDERINGEN EN RECHTSGEDINGEN

### Artikel  20  

####Scheepsvoorrecht

1.  Geen bepaling van dit Verdrag doet afbreuk aan het scheepsvoorrecht van de hulpverlener krachtens een verdrag of nationaal recht.   
2.  De hulpverlener kan zijn scheepsvoorrecht niet uitoefenen, wanneer hem op een behoorlijke wijze voldoende zekerheid voor zijn vordering, met inbegrip van rente en kosten, is aangeboden of verstrekt.   

### Artikel  21  

####Verplichting tot het verstrekken van zekerheid

1.  Op verzoek van de hulpverlener moet degene die aansprakelijk is voor een betaling krachtens dit Verdrag voldoende zekerheid stellen voor de voldoening van de vordering van de hulpverlener, met inbegrip van rente en kosten.   
2.  Onverminderd het in het eerste lid bepaalde moet de eigenaar van het schip waaraan de hulp is verleend zich inspannen om, voordat de lading wordt vrijgegeven, van de eigenaren daarvan voldoende zekerheid te verkrijgen voor de voldoening van de vorderingen, met inbegrip van rente en kosten, die jegens hen geldend kunnen worden gemaakt.   
3.  Het schip en de andere zaken waaraan de hulp is verleend mogen niet zonder toestemming van de hulpverlener worden verwijderd van de eerste haven of plaats waar zij na beëindiging van de hulpverlening zijn aangekomen, totdat voldoende zekerheid is gesteld voor de voldoening van de vordering van de hulpverlener op het schip of de andere zaken.   

### Artikel  22  

####Interim-uitkering

1.  Het gerecht dat bevoegd is kennis te nemen van de vordering van de hulpverlener kan bij tussenvonnis bevelen dat aan hem een billijke en rechtvaardige interim-uitkering wordt verstrekt en wel onder voorwaarden, zonodig daaronder begrepen voorwaarden terzake van zekerheidsstelling, die gezien de omstandigheden van het geval billijk en rechtvaardig zijn.   
2.  Ingeval van een krachtens dit artikel verstrekte interim-uitkering wordt de in artikel 21 bedoelde zekerheidsstelling dienovereenkomstig verminderd.   

### Artikel  23  

####Verjaring van vorderingen

1.  Iedere rechtsvordering betreffende een betaling krachtens dit Verdrag verjaart, indien niet binnen een tijdvak van twee jaar een gerechtelijke of scheidsrechtelijke procedure aanhangig is gemaakt. De verjaringstermijn vangt aan op de dag waarop de hulpverlening is beëindigd.   
2.  Degene tegen wie een vordering is ingesteld kan gedurende de termijn dat de verjaring loopt te allen tijde die termijn verlengen door middel van een verklaring gericht aan de vorderende partij. Deze termijn kan op gelijke wijze verder worden verlengd.   
3.  Een vordering tot verhaal door een aansprakelijke persoon kan zelfs worden ingesteld na afloop van de verjaringstermijn als bedoeld in de vorige leden, indien zij wordt ingesteld binnen de termijn die is vastgesteld door de wet van de Staat waar het geding aanhangig is gemaakt.   

### Artikel  24  

####Rente

Het recht van de hulpverlener op rente over een krachtens dit Verdrag verschuldigde betaling wordt bepaald door de wet van de Staat waarin het gerecht is gevestigd waar de zaak aanhangig is.  

### Artikel  25  

####Ladingen die toebehoren aan een Staat

Tenzij de Staat die eigenaar van de lading is daarin toestemt, kan geen bepaling van dit Verdrag worden ingeroepen om beslag te leggen op of door middel van een rechtsmaatregel terug te houden niet voor handelsdoeleinden bestemde ladingen die toebehoren aan een Staat en terzake waarvan ten tijde van de hulpverlening volgens algemeen erkende beginselen van internationaal recht een beroep kan worden gedaan op staatsimmuniteit; tegen die ladingen kan evenmin een vordering *in rem* worden ingesteld.  

### Artikel  26  

####Ladingen bestemd voor humanitaire doeleinden

Geen bepaling van dit Verdrag kan worden ingeroepen om beslag te leggen op of terug te houden een lading die bestemd is voor humanitaire doeleinden en die geschonken is door een Staat, indien die Staat toegestemd heeft in de betaling voor de hulpverleningswerkzaamheden ten aanzien van die lading.  

### Artikel  27  

####Publikatie van arbitrale vonnissen

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag moedigen, voor zover mogelijk en met de toestemming van de betrokken partijen, de publikatie aan van arbitrale vonnissen die zijn gewezen in zaken betreffende hulpverlening.
