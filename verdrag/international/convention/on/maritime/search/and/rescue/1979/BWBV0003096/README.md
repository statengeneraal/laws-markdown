.2.2 when information has been received indicating that the operating efficiency of a vessel or other craft is impaired, but not to the extent that a distress situation is likely.    

.3 Distress phase: 

.3.1 when positive information is received that a person, avessel or other craft is in danger and in need of immediate assistance; or  

.3.2 when, following the alert phase, further unsuccessful attempts to establish contact with a person, a vessel or other craft and more widespread unsuccessful inquiries point to the probability that a distress situation exists; or  

.3.3 when information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of a vessel or other craft has been impaired to the extent that a distress situation is likely.      

4.5.  *Procedures to be followed by rescue co-ordination centres and rescue sub-centres during emergency phases*  

4.5.1. Upon the declaration of the uncertainty phase, the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre, as appropriate, shall initiate inquiries to determine the safety of a person, a vessel or other craft, or shall declare the alert phase.  

4.5.2. Upon the declaration of the alert phase, the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre, as appropriate, shall extend the inquiries for the missing person, vessel or other craft, alert appropriate search and rescue services and initiate such action, as is necessary in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.  

4.5.3. Upon the declaration of the distress phase, the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre, as appropriate, shall proceed as prescribed in its plans of operation, as required by paragraph 4.1.    

4.5.4.  *Initiation of search and rescue operations when the position of the search object is unknown*  In the event of an emergency phase being declared for a search object whose position is unknown, the following shall apply: 

.1 when an emergency phase exists, a rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre shall, unless it is aware that other centres are taking action, assume responsibility for initiating suitable action and confer with other centres with the objective of designating one centre to assume responsibility;  

.2 unless otherwise decided by agreement between the centres concerned, the centre to be designated shall be the centre responsible for the area in which the search object was according to its last reported position; and  

.3 after the declaration of the distress phase, the centre co-ordinating the search and rescue operations shall, as appropriate, inform other centres of all the circumstances of the emergency and of all subsequent developments.    

4.5.5.  *Passing information to persons, vessels, or other craft for which an emergency phase has been declared*  Whenever possible, the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre responsible for search and rescue operations shall forward to the person, a vessel or other craft for which an emergency phase has been declared, information on the search and rescue operations it has initiated.  

4.6.  *Co-ordination when two or more Parties are involved*  For search and rescue operations involving more than one Party, each Party shall take appropriate action in accordance with the plans of operation referred to in paragraph 4.1 when so requested by the rescue co-ordination centre of the region.  

4.7.  *On-scene co-ordination of search and rescue activities*  

4.7.1.  The activities of search and rescue units and other facilities engaged in search and rescue operations shall be co-ordinated on-scene to ensure the most effective results.  

4.7.2.  When multiple facilities are about to engage in search and rescue operations, and the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre considers it necessary, the most capable person should be designated as on-scene co-ordinator as early as practicable and preferably before the facilities arrive within the specified area of operation. Specific responsibilities shall be assigned to the on-scene co-ordinator taking into account the apparent capabilities of the on-scene co-ordinator and operational requirements.  

4.7.3.  If there is no responsible rescue co-ordination centre or, for any reason, the responsible rescue co-ordination centre is unable to co-ordinate the search and rescue mission, the facilities involved should designate an on-scene co-ordinator by mutual agreement.    

4.8.  *Termination and suspension of search and rescue operations*  

4.8.1.  Search and rescue operations shall continue, when practicable, until all reasonable hope of rescuing survivors has passed.  

4.8.2.  The responsible rescue co-ordination center or rescue sub-center concerned shall normally decide when to discontinue search and rescue operations. If no such centre is involved in co-ordinating the operations, the on-scene co-ordinator may take this decision.  

4.8.3.  When a rescue co-ordination center or rescue sub-centre considers, on the basis of reliable information that a search and rescue operation has been successful, or that the emergency no longer exists, it shall terminate the search and rescue operation and promptly so inform any authority, facility or service which has been activated or notified.  

4.8.4.  If a search and rescue operation on-scene becomes impracticable and the rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre concludes that survivors might still be alive, the centre may temporarily suspend the on-scene activities pending further developments, and shall promptly so inform any authority, facility or service which has been activated or notified. Information subsequently received shall be evaluated and search and rescue operations resumed when justified on the basis of such information.  

4.8.5 The rescue co-ordination centre or rescue sub-centre concerned shall initiate the process of identifying the most appropriate place(s) for disembarking persons found in distress at sea. It shall inform the ship or ships and other relevant parties concerned thereof.     CHAPTER 5 SHIP REPORTING SYSTEMS 

5.1.  *General*  

5.1.1. Ship reporting systems may be established either individuallyby Parties or in co-operation with other States, where this is considered necessary, to facilitate search and rescue operations.  

5.1.2. Parties contemplating the institution of a ship reporting system should take account of the relevant recommendations of the Organization. Parties should also consider whether existing reporting systems or other sources of ship position data can provide adequate information for the region, and seek to minimize unnecessary additional reports by ships, or the need for rescue co-ordination centres to check with multiple reporting systems to determine availability of ships to assist with search and rescue operations.  

5.1.3. The ship reporting system should provide up-to-date information on the movements of vessels in order, in the event of a distress incident, to:

De Partijen moeten hun verantwoordelijke autoriteit machtigen plannen met betrekking tot uit te voeren acties en regelingen op te stellen voor de samenwerking en coördinatie inzake opsporing en redding met de verantwoordelijke autoriteiten van andere staten.  

3.1.9. De Partijen werken samen, en coördineren daarbij hun acties, teneinde te waarborgen dat kapiteins van schepen die hulp bieden door personen die op zee in nood verkeren aan boord te nemen, van hun verplichtingen worden ontslagen waarbij de schepen zo min mogelijk verder hoeven af te wijken van hun voorgenomen reis, op voorwaarde dat door het ontslaan van de kapitein van het schip van zijn verplichtingen de veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee niet verder in gevaar wordt gebracht. De Partij die verantwoordelijk is voor het opsporings- en reddingsgebied waarin dergelijke hulp wordt geboden is primair verantwoordelijk voor het waarborgen van dergelijke coördinatie en samenwerking zodat de geholpen overlevenden het te hulp geschoten schip op een veilige plaats kunnen verlaten, rekening houdend met de specifieke omstandigheden van het geval en de door de Organisatie ontwikkelde richtlijnen. In dergelijke gevallen zorgen de desbetreffende Partijen ervoor dat deze ontscheping zo snel als redelijkerwijs mogelijk is zal geschieden.     HOOFDSTUK 4 WERKPROCEDURES 

4.1.  *Voorbereidende maatregelen*  

4.1.1. Elk reddingscoördinatiecentrum en reddingssubcentrum moet beschikken over bijgewerkte gegevens, in het bijzonder met betrekking tot opsporings- en reddingsvoorzieningen en de beschikbare verbindingsmiddelen met betrekking tot opsporings- en reddingsacties in zijn gebied.  

4.1.2. Elk reddingscoördinatiecentrum en reddingssubcentrum behoort gemakkelijk te kunnen beschikken over gegevens betreffende de positie, koers en snelheid van schepen die zich binnen zijn gebied bevinden en mogelijkerwijze hulp kunnen verlenen aan personen, schepen of andere vaartuigen die op zee in nood verkeren, en betreffende de manier waarop men zich met hen in verbinding kan stellen. Deze gegevens behoren in bezit te zijn van het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of gemakkelijk beschikbaar te zijn indien dat noodzakelijk is.  

4.1.3. Elk reddingscoördinatiecentrum en reddingssubcentrum moet beschikken over nauwkeurig omschreven werkplannen voor de uitvoering van opsporings- en reddingsoperaties. Indien van toepassing moeten deze plannen worden ontwikkeld samen met de vertegenwoordigers van diegenen die kunnen helpen bij het leveren van, of die mogelijk belang hebben bij, de opsporings- en reddingsdiensten.  

4.1.4. Reddingscoördinatiecentra of subcentra moeten op de hoogte worden gehouden van de staat van paraatheid van opsporings- en reddingseenheden.    

4.2.  *Gegevens over noodsituaties*  

4.2.1. De Partijen moeten, individueel of in samenwerking met andere staten, ervoor zorg dragen dat zij in staat zijn 24 uur per dag onmiddellijk en op betrouwbare wijze noodberichten te ontvangen van apparatuur die voor dat doel wordt gebruikt binnen hun opsporings- en reddingsgebieden. Een alarmeringspost die een noodbericht ontvangt, moet: 

.1  het alarm onmiddellijk doorgeven aan het daarvoor in aanmerking komende reddingscoördinatiecentrum of subcentrum, en vervolgens waar nodig assisteren bij de opsporings- en reddingscommunicatie; en  

.2  indien dat praktisch uitvoerbaar is, de ontvangst van het alarm bevestigen.    

4.2.2. Waar van toepassing moeten de Partijen ervoor zorg dragen dat zij beschikken over doeltreffende regelingen voor de registratie van communicatieapparatuur en voor het reageren op noodsituaties, om reddingscoördinatiecentra of subcentra snel toegang te verlenen tot relevante registratiegegevens.  

4.2.3. Elke autoriteit of ieder onderdeel van de opsporings- en reddingsdienst die of dat van oordeel is dat een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig in nood verkeert, moet alle beschikbare gegevens zo spoedig mogelijk doen toekomen aan het desbetreffende reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum.  

4.2.4.  Zodra gegevens betreffende een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig in nood zijn ontvangen, moeten de reddingscoördinatiecentra en reddingssubcentra deze gegevens evalueren en vaststellen welke noodtoestandsfase overeenkomstig het bepaalde in 4.4 is ingetreden en in welke mate handelend moet worden opgetreden.    

4.3.  *Eerste maatregelen*  Een opsporings- en reddingseenheid die informatie over een noodgeval ontvangt moet in eerste instantie onmiddellijk maatregelen nemen indien zij in staat is te helpen en moet, in elk geval onverwijld, het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum in het gebied waarin het voorval zich heeft voorgedaan, in kennis stellen.  

4.4.  *Noodtoestandsfasen*  Teneinde te helpen bij het vaststellen van de geschikte werkprocedures, moeten de volgende noodtoestandsfasen worden onderscheiden door het desbetreffende reddingscoördinatiecentrum of subcentrum: 

.1 Onzekerheidsfase: 

.1.1 wanneer een persoon als vermist wordt opgegeven of een schip of ander vaartuig niet op tijd is; of  

.1.2 wanneer een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig niet, zoals verwacht, zijn positie heeft gemeld of dat hij/het in veiligheid verkeert.    

.2 Alarmeringsfase 

.2.1 wanneer, volgend op de onzekerheidsfase, pogingen om contact met een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig te krijgen tot niets hebben geleid en navraag bij andere daarvoor in aanmerking komende bronnen geen resultaat heeft opgeleverd; of  

.2.2 wanneer inlichtingen zijn ontvangen die erop wijzen dat het doelmatig functioneren van een schip of ander vaartuig is verminderd, zij het niet in zodanige mate dat het waarschijnlijk is dat het schip in nood verkeert.    

.3 Noodfase: 

.3.1 wanneer volstrekt betrouwbare inlichtingen worden ontvangen dat een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig aan gevaar blootstaat en onverwijld hulp nodig heeft; of  

.3.2 wanneer volgend op de alarmeringsfase verdere pogingen om contact met een persoon, een schip of een ander vaartuig te krijgen en uitgebreidere navraag geen resultaat hebben opgeleverd, waaruit kan worden afgeleid dat het waarschijnlijk is dat een noodsituatie bestaat; of  

.3.3 wanneer inlichtingen worden ontvangen die erop wijzen dat het doelmatig functioneren van een schip of ander vaartuig zodanig is verminderd dat een noodsituatie waarschijnlijk is.      

4.5.  *Procedures die door reddingscoördinatiecentra en reddingssubcentra moeten worden gevolgd tijdens noodtoestandsfasen*  

4.5.1. Zodra de onzekerheidsfase is afgekondigd, moet het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum, naar gelang het geval is, navraag doen teneinde vast te stellen in hoeverre de persoon, het schip of het andere vaartuig zich in veiligheid bevindt, dan wel de alarmeringsfase afkondigen.  

4.5.2. Zodra de alarmeringsfase is afgekondigd, moet het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of het reddingssubcentrum, naar gelang het geval is, nadere inlichtingen over de vermiste persoon of het vermiste schip of andere vaartuig inwinnen, de daarvoor in aanmerking komende reddingsdiensten alarmeren en een aanvang maken met de uitvoering van die maatregelen die in het desbetreffende geval noodzakelijk worden geacht.  

4.5.3. Zodra de noodfase is afgekondigd, moet het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of het reddingssubcentrum, naar gelang het geval is, handelen als voorgeschreven in zijn werkplannen, als vereist in 4.1.    

4.5.4.  *Begin van opsporings- en reddingsacties wanneer de positie van het gezochte object onbekend is*  Wanneer een noodtoestandsfase wordt afgekondigd betreffende een gezocht object waarvan de positie onbekend is, is het onderstaande van toepassing: 

.1 wanneer er sprake is van een noodtoestandsfase moet een reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum, tenzij het ervan op de hoogte is dat andere centra maatregelen hebben getroffen, de verantwoordelijkheid op zich nemen voor het treffen van gepaste maatregelen en met andere centra in overleg treden teneinde één centrum aan te wijzen dat onverwijld de verantwoordelijkheid op zich moet nemen;  

.2 tenzij op grond van afspraken tussen de betrokken centra anders is besloten, moet het aan te wijzen centrum, het centrum zijn dat verantwoordelijk is voor het gebied waar het gezochte object zich volgens zijn laatst gemelde positie bevond; en  

.3 nadat de noodfase is afgekondigd, moet het centrum dat de opsporings- en reddingsacties coördineert, indien van toepassing, andere centra van alle omstandigheden die verband houden met de noodsituatie alsmede van elke ontwikkeling die zich daarna voordoet, op de hoogte stellen.    

4.5.5.  *Doorgeven van inlichtingen aan personen, schepen of andere vaartuigen ten aanzien waarvan een noodtoestandsfase is afgekondigd*  In alle gevallen waarin dit mogelijk is, moet het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum dat verantwoordelijk is voor opsporings- en reddingsacties inlichtingen betreffende de opsporings- en reddingsacties waarmee het een begin heeft gemaakt, doorgeven aan de persoon, het schip of het andere vaartuig ten aanzien waarvan de noodtoestandsfase is afgekondigd.  

4.6.  *Coördinatie wanneer twee of meer Partijen bij de acties zijn betrokken*  Voor opsporings- en reddingsacties waarbij meer dan een Partij is betrokken, moet elke Partij op verzoek van het reddingscoördinatiecentrum van het gebied, de daarvoor in aanmerking komende maatregelen treffen overeenkomstig de werkplannen als bedoeld in 4.1.  

4.7.  *Coördinatie van de opsporings- en reddingsactiviteiten ter plaatse*  

4.7.1.  De activiteiten van opsporings- en reddingseenheden en andere voorzieningen die betrokken zijn bij opsporings- en reddingsacties moeten ter plaatse worden gecoördineerd teneinde zo doeltreffend mogelijke resultaten te verkrijgen.  

4.7.2.  Zodra verscheidene voorzieningen zullen worden ingezet bij opsporings- en reddingsacties, en het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum dat noodzakelijk acht, behoort de meest capabele persoon zo snel als praktisch uitvoerbaar en bij voorkeur voordat de voorzieningen binnen het gespecificeerde gebied van handeling arriveren, te worden aangewezen als coördinator ter plaatse. Aan de coördinator ter plaatse moeten specifieke verantwoordelijkheden worden toegekend, rekening houdend met de klaarblijkelijke capaciteiten van de coördinator ter plaatse en de operationele vereisten.  

4.7.3.  Indien er geen verantwoordelijk reddingscoördinatiecentrum is of indien het verantwoordelijke reddingscoördinatiecentrum om enige reden niet in staat is de opsporings- en reddingsopdracht te coördineren, behoren de betrokken voorzieningen in onderling overleg een coördinator ter plaatse aan te wijzen.    

4.8.  *Beëindiging en opschorting van opsporings- en reddingsactiviteiten*  

4.8.1.  Opsporings- en reddingsactiviteiten moeten, wanneer dat praktisch uitvoerbaar is, doorgaan totdat er redelijkerwijs geen hoop op redding van overlevenden meer bestaat.  

4.8.2.  Het betrokken verantwoordelijke reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum moet normaliter besluiten wanneer de opsporings- en reddingsoperaties worden gestaakt. Indien er geen dergelijk centrum betrokken is bij de coördinatie van de acties mag de coördinator ter plaatse dit besluit nemen.  

4.8.3.  Wanneer een reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum op basis van betrouwbare inlichtingen van mening is dat een opsporings- en reddingsactie succes heeft gehad, of dat de noodsituatie niet meer bestaat, moet het de opsporings- en reddingsactie beëindigen en de autoriteiten, voorzieningen of diensten die zijn ingeschakeld of in kennis gesteld, onverwijld daarover informeren.  

4.8.4.  Indien een opsporings- en reddingsactie ter plaatse onuitvoerbaar wordt en het reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum concludeert dat overlevenden nog in leven zouden kunnen zijn, kan het centrum de activiteiten ter plaatse tijdelijk opschorten in afwachting van verdere ontwikkelingen, en moet het de autoriteiten, voorzieningen of diensten die zijn ingeschakeld of in kennis gesteld, onverwijld daarover informeren. De informatie die daarna wordt ontvangen, moet worden geëvalueerd en de opsporings- en reddingsactiviteiten moeten worden hervat wanneer dat op basis van die informatie gerechtvaardigd is.  

4.8.5. Het desbetreffende reddingscoördinatiecentrum of reddingssubcentrum start het proces om de geschiktste plaats(en) te identificeren waar personen die op zee in nood verkeerden van boord kunnen gaan. Het centrum stelt het schip of de schepen en overige relevante partijen die betrokken zijn hiervan op de hoogte.     HOOFDSTUK 5 MELDINGSSYSTEMEN VOOR SCHEPEN 

5.1.  *Algemeen*  

5.1.1. Wanneer dat voor het vergemakkelijken van opsporings- en reddingsacties noodzakelijk wordt geacht, kunnen meldingssystemen voor schepen door de Partijen individueel of in samenwerking met andere staten worden opgezet.  

5.1.2. Indien Partijen een meldingssysteem voor schepen overwegen op te zetten, behoren zij daarbij rekening te houden met de desbetreffende aanbevelingen van de Organisatie. De Partijen behoren ook in overweging te nemen of bestaande meldingssystemen of andere bronnen met gegevens inzake de positie van schepen adequate informatie voor het gebied kunnen verschaffen, en moeten trachten onnodige extra meldingen door schepen, of de noodzaak voor reddingscoördinatiecentra met verscheidene meldingssystemen te controleren of er schepen beschikbaar zijn om bij opsporings- en reddingsacties te assisteren, tot een minimum te reduceren.  

5.1.3. Het meldingssysteem voor schepen behoort de laatste gegevens omtrent de vaarroute van schepen te verstrekken, teneinde in geval van nood: 

.1  de periode tussen het tijdstip waarop het contact met het schip is verbroken en dat waarop de opsporings- en reddingsacties een aanvang nemen in die gevallen te verkorten waarin geen noodsein is ontvangen;  

.2  snel te kunnen vaststellen op welke schepen een beroep zou kunnen worden gedaan om hulp te verlenen;  

.3  het afbakenen van een opsporingsgebied van beperkte grootte mogelijk te maken, ingeval de positie van een in nood verkerende persoon of een in nood verkerend schip of ander vaartuig onbekend of onzeker is; en  

.4  gemakkelijker dringend gewenste medische hulp of adviezen te kunnen verstrekken.      

5.2  *Eisen waaraan het meldingssysteem moet voldoen*  

5.2.1. Meldingssystemen voor schepen behoren aan de volgende eisen te voldoen: 

.1  het verschaffen van inlichtingen, met inbegrip van de vaarplannen en de positiemeldingen, aan de hand waarvan de huidige en toekomstige posities van de deelnemende schepen kunnen worden vastgesteld;  

.2  het bijhouden van een kaart waarop de scheepsposities zijn geplot;  

.3  het met geregelde tussenpozen ontvangen van meldingen van de deelnemende schepen;  

.4  eenvoud van opzet en werking van het systeem; en  

.5  gebruik van internationaal overeengekomen standaardberichtvormen en -procedures.      

5.3  *Soorten meldingen*  

5.3.1. Een meldingssysteem voor schepen behoort de volgende soorten scheepsmeldingen te omvatten, overeenkomstig de aanbevelingen van de Organisatie: 

.1  Vaarplan  

.2  Positiemelding; en  

.3  Eindrapport      

5.4.  *Gebruik van de systemen*  

5.4.1. De Partijen behoren alle schepen aan te sporen hun posities te melden, wanneer zij in gebieden varen waar maatregelen zijn getroffen voor het verzamelen van gegevens omtrent de posities van schepen ten behoeve van eventuele opsporings- en reddingsacties.  

5.4.2. De Partijen die gegevens omtrent de posities van schepen registreren, behoren deze zoveel mogelijk aan andere staten door te geven, zodra daarom wordt verzocht ten behoeve van eventuele opsporings- en reddingsacties.
