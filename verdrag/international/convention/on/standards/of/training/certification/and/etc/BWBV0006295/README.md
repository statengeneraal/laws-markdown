### Regulation  4  

####Control procedures

1. Control exercised by a duly authorized officer under article 8 shall be limited to the following: 

.1 verification that all fishing vessel personnel serving on board who are required to be certificated by this Convention are so certificated or hold the required dispensation. Such certificates shall be accepted unless there are clear grounds for believing that a certificate has been fraudulently obtained or that the holder of a certificate is not the person to whom that certificate was originally issued; and  

.2 assessment of the ability of the fishing vessel personnel to maintain watchkeeping standards as required by the Convention if there are clear grounds for believing that such standards are not being maintained, because the following have occurred: 

.2.1 the vessel has been involved in a collision, grounding or stranding; or  

.2.2 there has been a discharge of substances from the vessel when under way, at anchor or at berth which is illegal under international conventions; or  

.2.3 the vessel has been manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner, whereby routeing measures adopted by the Organization, or safe navigation practices and procedures, have not been followed; or  

.2.4 the vessel is otherwise being operated in such a manner as to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment.      

2. In the event that deficiencies are found under paragraph 1, the officer carrying out the control shall forthwith inform, in writing, the skipper of the vessel and the Administration, so that appropriate action may be taken. Such notification shall specify the details of the deficiencies found and the grounds on which the Party determines that these deficiencies pose a danger to persons, property or the environment.  

3. Deficiencies which may be deemed to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment include the following: 

.1 failure of persons, required to hold a certificate, to have an appropriate certificate or dispensation;  

.2 failure of navigational or engineering watch arrangements to conform to the requirements specified for the vessel by the Administration;

2. A Party which fails to communicate information required by article 4 within twenty-four months after the date of entry into force of the Convention for a Party shall not be entitled to claim the privileges of this Convention until such time as the information has been received by the Secretary-General.    

### Regulation  6  

####Administration of certification arrangements

1. Each Party undertakes to establish and maintain a means of ensuring that programmes incorporating such instruction and practical training as is necessary to achieve the competency standards are regularly monitored to ensure their effectiveness.  

2. Each Party undertakes, to the extent practicable, to maintain a register or registers of all certificates and endorsements specified in regulations 3 and II/1 to II/6 which are issued, have expired, or have been revalidated, reported lost, suspended or cancelled, and of dispensations issued, and provide information on the status of such certificates, endorsements and dispensations when so requested by another Party.    

### Regulation  7  

####Recognition of certificates

1. Each Administration shall ensure, in order to recognize, by endorsement in accordance with regulation 3, a certificate issued by or under the authority of another Party, that the requirements for standards of competence, as well as the issue and endorsement of certificates by that Party, are fully complied with.  

2. Certificates issued by or under the authority of a non-Party shall not be recognized.  

3. Notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph 1 of this regulation and paragraph 5 of regulation 3, an Administration may, if circumstances require, allow a person to serve for a period not exceeding three months on board a vessel entitled to fly its flag while holding an appropriate and valid certificate issued by another Party without it being endorsed as required by paragraph 5 of regulation 3 provided that documented proof is made available that application for an endorsement has been submitted to the Administration.    

### Regulation  8  

####Transitional provisions

1. A certificate of competency or of service in a capacity for which this Convention requires a certificate and which before entry into force of the Convention for a Party is issued in accordance with the laws of that Party or the Radio Regulations, shall be recognized as valid for service after entry into force of the Convention for that Party.  

2. After the entry into force of the Convention for a Party, it may continue to issue certificates of competency in accordance with its previous practices for a period not exceeding five years. Such certificates shall be recognized as valid for the purpose of the Convention. During this transitional period such certificates shall be issued only to persons who had commenced their sea service before entry into force of the Convention for that Party within the specific ship department to which those certificates relate. The Party shall ensure that all other candidates for certification shall be examined and certificated in accordance with the Convention.  

3. A Party may, within two years after entry into force of the Convention for that Party, issue a certificate of service to fishing vessel personnel who hold neither an appropriate certificate under the Convention nor a certificate of competency issued under its laws before entry into force of the Convention for that Party but who have: 

.1 served in the capacity for which they seek a certificate of service for not less than three years at sea within the last seven years preceding entry into force of the Convention for that Party;  

.2 produced evidence that they have performed that service satisfactorily; and  

.3 satisfied the Party as to medical fitness, including eyesight and hearing, taking into account their age at the time of application.   For the purpose of the Convention, a certificate of service issued under this paragraph shall be regarded as the equivalent of a certificate issued under the Convention.    

### Regulation  9  

####Dispensation

1. In circumstances of exceptional necessity, an Administration, if in its opinion this will not cause danger to persons, property or the environment, may issue a dispensation permitting a person to serve in a specified fishing vessel for a specified period not exceeding six months in a capacity, other than that of the radio operator, except as provided by the relevant Radio Regulations, for which the person does not hold the appropriate certificate, provided that the person to whom the dispensation is issued shall be adequately qualified to fill the vacant post in a safe manner, to the satisfaction of the Administration.  

2. Any dispensation granted for a post shall be granted only to a person properly certificated to fill the post immediately below it. Where certification of the post below is not required by the Convention, a dispensation may be issued to a person whose competence and experience are, in the opinion of the Administration, clearly equivalent to the requirements for the post to be filled, provided that, if such a person holds no appropriate certificate, the person shall be required to pass a test accepted by the Administration as demonstrating that such a dispensation may safely be issued. In addition, the Administration shall ensure that the post in question is filled by the holder of an appropriate certificate as soon as possible.  

3. Each Party shall as soon as possible after 1 January each year send a report to the Secretary-General giving information of the total number of dispensations in respect of each capacity for which a certificate is required, including nil returns.    

### Regulation  10  

####Equivalents

1. The Convention shall not prevent a Party from retaining or adopting other educational and training arrangements, including those involving seagoing service and shipboard organization especially adapted to technical developments and to special types of vessels, provided that the level of seagoing service, knowledge and efficiency as regards navigational and technical handling of vessels ensures a degree of safety at sea and has a preventive effect as regards pollution at least equivalent to the requirements of the Convention.  

2. Details of such arrangements shall be included in the report under article 4.

.2 een kapitein heeft toegestaan dat een functie of dienst in een hoedanigheid die krachtens deze voorschriften moet worden verricht door een persoon die in het bezit is van een passend bewijs, wordt verricht door een persoon die niet in het bezit is van een passend bewijs of passende ontheffing; of  

.3 een persoon middels fraude of vervalste documenten een aanstelling heeft gekregen om een functie te vervullen of dienst te doen in een hoedanigheid waarvan de uitoefening of vervulling volgens deze voorschriften moet geschieden door een persoon die in het bezit is van een bewijs of ontheffing.

2.  Indien wordt verzuimd de in voorschrift I/4, paragraaf 3, genoemde tekortkoming te herstellen en voor zover dit een gevaar oplevert voor personen, zaken of het milieu, neemt de partij die de controle uitvoert stappen om te waarborgen dat het schip niet uitvaart tenzij en totdat zodanig aan deze vereisten is voldaan dat het gevaar is weggenomen. De feiten betreffende de genomen maatregelen worden onverwijld aan de Secretaris-Generaal en aan de administratie medegedeeld.   
3.  Bij het uitoefenen van de controles: 

.1 moet al het mogelijke in het werk worden gesteld teneinde te voorkomen dat het schip onnodig wordt opgehouden of vertraagd. Indien een schip onnodig wordt opgehouden of vertraagd, ontstaat er recht op schadevergoeding voor daaruit voortvloeiende verliezen of schade; en

Deze bewijzen worden geaccepteerd tenzij er duidelijke gronden zijn om aan te nemen dat een bewijs op frauduleuze wijze is verkregen of dat de houder van een bewijs niet degene is aan wie het bewijs oorspronkelijk is afgegeven; en  

.2 het vaststellen van de geschiktheid van het personeel van vissersschepen om te voldoen aan de door het Verdrag vereiste normen inzake wachtdienst indien er duidelijke gronden zijn om aan te nemen dat niet aan die normen wordt voldaan omdat zich een van de volgende feiten heeft voorgedaan: 

.2.1 het schip is bij een aanvaring betrokken geweest, is aan de grond gelopen of is gestrand; of  

.2.2 er heeft lozing van stoffen vanuit het schip plaatsgevonden, terwijl het onderweg was, voor anker lag of aangemeerd was, hetgeen onrechtmatig is krachtens internationaal verdragen; of  

.2.3 er is op foutieve of onveilige wijze met het schip gemanoeuvreerd waarbij de door de Organisatie aangenomen routeringsmaatregelen of veilige navigatiemethoden en -procedures niet in acht zijn genomen; of  

.2.4 de bedrijfsvoering aan boord geschiedt anderszins op zodanige wijze dat het schip een gevaar vormt voor personen, zaken of het milieu.      

2. Indien uit hoofde van het eerste lid tekortkomingen worden geconstateerd, stelt de functionaris die de controle uitvoert de kapitein van het schip onverwijld schriftelijk hiervan in kennis opdat passende maatregelen kunnen worden genomen. In deze kennisgeving worden de tekortkomingen gedetailleerd omschreven alsmede de gronden waarop de partij besluit dat deze tekortkomingen een gevaar vormen voor personen, zaken of het milieu.  

3. Onder tekortkomingen die als gevaarlijk kunnen worden aangemerkt voor personen, zaken of het milieu wordt onder meer het volgende verstaan: 

.1 personen die een bewijs moeten hebben beschikken niet over een passend bewijs of passende ontheffing;  

.2 de regelingen voor de wacht op de brug of de wacht in de machinekamer voldoen niet aan de door de administratie voor het schip vastgestelde eisen;  

.3 er is tijdens de wacht niemand aanwezig die bevoegd is de uitrusting te bedienen die noodzakelijk is voor veilige navigatie, veilige radioverbindingen of het voorkomen van verontreiniging; of  

.4 het is niet mogelijk aan het begin van de reis en bij de daaropvolgende aflossende wachten te zorgen voor personeel dat rust heeft genoten.

3. Niettegenstaande het vereiste van paragraaf 1 van dit voorschrift en paragraaf 5 van voorschrift 3, kan een administratie, indien de omstandigheden dit vereisen, een persoon die in het bezit is van een passend en geldig bewijs afgegeven door een andere partij, maar niet voorzien van een officiële verklaring als vereist door paragraaf 5 van voorschrift 3, toestaan gedurende een periode van ten hoogste drie maanden dienst te doen aan boord van een schip dat gerechtigd is haar vlag te voeren, mits deze persoon een schriftelijk bewijs overlegt waaruit blijkt dat een officiële verklaring bij de administratie is aangevraagd.    

### Voorschrift  8  

####Overgangsbepalingen

1. Een vaarbevoegdheidsbewijs of bewijs van diensttijd in een bepaalde hoedanigheid waarvoor dit Verdrag een bewijs eist, dat vóór de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor een partij is afgegeven overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die partij of het Radioreglement, wordt als geldig erkend voor het dienst doen in die hoedanigheid na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor die partij.  

2. Na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor een partij kan zij gedurende een periode van ten hoogste vijf jaar vaarbevoegdheidsbewijzen blijven afgeven overeenkomstig haar vroegere praktijk. Dergelijke bewijzen worden voor de toepassing van het Verdrag als geldig erkend. Gedurende deze overgangsperiode mogen dergelijke bewijzen uitsluitend worden afgegeven aan personen die hun dienst op zee hebben aangevangen vóór de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor die partij in de specifieke categorie schepen waarop die bewijzen betrekking hebben. De partij moet waarborgen dat alle andere kandidaten die in aanmerking willen komen voor een bewijs, worden geëxamineerd en gediplomeerd overeenkomstig het Verdrag.  

3. Een partij kan gedurende twee jaar na de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor die partij een bewijs van diensttijd afgeven aan personeelsleden van vissersschepen die noch houder zijn van een passend bewijs volgens het Verdrag, noch van een vaarbevoegdheidsbewijs, afgegeven uit hoofde van haar wetgeving vóór de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag voor de partij, maar die:

Voor de toepassing van het Verdrag wordt een krachtens deze paragraaf afgegeven bewijs van diensttijd beschouwd als gelijkwaardig aan een krachtens het Verdrag afgegeven bewijs.    

### Voorschrift  9  

####Ontheffingen

1. In buitengewoon dringende omstandigheden kan een administratie, indien dit naar haar oordeel geen gevaar oplevert voor personen, zaken of het milieu, een ontheffing verlenen waardoor een bepaalde persoon wordt toegestaan gedurende een bepaalde periode van ten hoogste zes maanden op een bepaald vissersschip dienst te doen in een hoedanigheid waarvoor hij niet het vereiste bewijs bezit – maar niet in de hoedanigheid van radio-operator, behalve zoals is bepaald in de desbetreffende bepalingen van het Radioreglement – mits degene aan wie ontheffing wordt verleend voldoende bekwaam is om de onbezette functie op een verantwoorde wijze te vervullen, zulks ter beoordeling van de administratie.  

2. Elke ten aanzien van een functie verleende ontheffing wordt slechts verleend aan een persoon die in het bezit is van het juiste bewijs voor de functie onmiddellijk daaronder. Indien het Verdrag geen bewijs vereist voor de functie daaronder, kan ontheffing worden verleend aan een persoon wiens bekwaamheden en ervaring naar het oordeel van de administratie duidelijk overeenstemmen met de eisen voor de te bezetten functie, mits van een dergelijke persoon, indien hij het vereiste bewijs niet bezit, wordt verlangd dat hij een test aflegt die door de administratie is aanvaard als bewijs dat die ontheffing zonder gevaar kan worden gegeven. Bovendien moet de administratie waarborgen dat de desbetreffende functie zo spoedig mogelijk wordt vervuld door iemand die een passend bewijs bezit.  

3. Elke partij zendt zo spoedig mogelijk na 1 januari van ieder jaar een verslag aan de Secretaris-Generaal, met gegevens over het totale aantal ontheffingen met betrekking tot iedere hoedanigheid waarvoor een bewijs vereist is, met inbegrip van nihil.    

### Voorschrift  10  

####Gelijkwaardige voorzieningen

1. Het Verdrag belet een partij niet andere regelingen inzake theoretische en praktische opleiding te handhaven of in te voeren, met inbegrip van regelingen inzake de dienst buitengaats en inzake de organisatie aan boord van het schip, die in het bijzonder zijn aangepast aan technische ontwikkelingen en aan bijzondere typen schepen, mits het niveau van de dienst buitengaats en van de kennis van en de geschiktheid voor de nautische en technische behandeling van schepen en de lading een mate van veiligheid op zee waarborgt en een preventief effect ten aanzien van vervuiling heeft, die ten minste gelijkwaardig zijn aan de eisen van het Verdrag.

####WACHTDIENST

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

### Voorschrift  1  

####Grondbeginselen die in acht moeten worden genomen bij het wachtlopen op de brug van vissersschepen

1. De administraties vestigen de aandacht van eigenaren en exploitanten van vissersschepen en van kapiteins en personeel dat wachtdienst doet op de volgende beginselen, die in acht moeten worden genomen teneinde te waarborgen dat te allen tijde een veilige brugwacht wordt gehouden.  

2. De kapitein van ieder vissersschip waarborgt dat de regelingen voor de wachtdienst toereikend zijn om te waarborgen dat een veilige brugwacht wordt gehouden. De officieren van de wacht zijn, onder de algemene leiding van de kapitein, verantwoordelijk voor de veilige navigatie van het vissersschip gedurende hun diensten, waarbij zij in het bijzonder bedacht moeten zijn op het vermijden van aanvaring en stranding.  

3. De grondbeginselen, met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot het volgende, moeten op alle vissersschepen in acht worden genomen. Een partij kan echter zeer kleine vissersschepen die in begrensde wateren vissen vrijstellen van volledige nakoming van de grondbeginselen.  

4. Varen naar en vanaf de visgronden 

4.1 Regelingen voor de brugwacht 

4.1.1 De samenstelling van de wacht moet te allen tijde doelmatig zijn en aangepast aan de heersende omstandigheden, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met de noodzaak een goede uitkijk te houden.  

4.1.2 Bij de beslissing over de samenstelling van de wacht moet onder meer met de volgende punten rekening worden gehouden: 

.1 de brug mag nooit onbemand blijven;  

.2 de weersomstandigheden, het zicht en of het dag of nacht is;  

.3 de nabijheid van gevaren voor de navigatie die de officier die is belast met de wachtdienst ertoe kunnen nopen extra navigatiewerkzaamheden te verrichten;  

.4 het gebruik en de bedrijfsklare staat van hulpmiddelen voor de navigatie, zoals radar of elektronische apparatuur voor plaatsbepaling en andere uitrusting die van belang is voor de veilige navigatie van het schip;  

.5 of het schip is uitgerust met een automatische stuurinrichting; en  

.6 alle bijkomende eisen die aan de brugwacht kunnen worden gesteld ten gevolge van bijzondere operationele omstandigheden.      

4.2 Geschiktheid voor dienst De wachtindeling moet zodanig zijn dat de doelmatigheid van degenen die wachtdienst hebben, niet door vermoeidheid wordt verminderd. De diensten moeten zo worden georganiseerd dat degene die aan het begin van een reis belast is met de eerste wacht, en degenen die vervolgens de wacht aflossen, voldoende zijn uitgerust en ook in andere opzichten berekend zijn op hun taak.  

4.3 Navigatie 

4.3.1. Voor de beoogde reis moet, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, vooraf een rooster worden opgesteld, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met alle ter zake dienende gegevens, en iedere vastgestelde koers moet worden gecontroleerd voordat de reis begint. 

4.3.2 Tijdens de wacht moeten de gestuurde koers, de positie en de vaart regelmatig genoeg worden gecontroleerd, met behulp van alle ten dienste staande navigatiemiddelen om te waarborgen dat het schip de uitgezette koers volgt.  

4.3.3 De officier van de wacht moet volledig bekend zijn met de plaats en werking van alle veiligheids- en navigatieuitrusting aan boord van het schip en op de hoogte zijn van en rekening houden met de beperkingen bij het gebruik van die uitrusting.  

4.3.4 Aan de officier belast met de brugwacht mogen geen taken worden opgedragen, noch mag hij taken op zich nemen, die de veilige navigatie van het schip in gevaar kunnen brengen.      

4.4 Navigatieuitrusting 

4.4.1 De officieren van de wacht moeten op zo doeltreffend mogelijke wijze gebruik maken van alle navigatieuitrusting die hun ter beschikking staat.  

4.4.2 Bij het gebruik van radar moet de officier van de wacht rekening houden met de noodzaak te allen tijde te voldoen aan de bepalingen inzake het gebruik van radar, vervat in de toepasselijke bepalingen ter voorkoming van aanvaringen op zee.  

4.4.3 In geval van nood mag de officier van de wacht niet aarzelen gebruik te maken van het roer, de machines en de apparatuur voor het geven van geluids- en lichtsignalen.    

4.5 Plichten en verantwoordelijkheden met betrekking tot de navigatie 

4.5.1 De officier belast met de wacht: 

.1 moet wachtlopen op de brug;  

.2 mag de brug in geen geval verlaten totdat hij naar behoren is afgelost;  

.3 behoudt de verantwoordelijkheid voor de veilige navigatie van het schip, niettegenstaande de aanwezigheid van de kapitein op de brug, totdat de kapitein hem uitdrukkelijk mededeelt dat hij verantwoordelijkheid heeft overgenomen, en zulks over en weer goed is begrepen;  

.4 moet de kapitein inlichten wanneer hij twijfelt hoe te handelen in het belang van de veiligheid; en  

.5 mag de wacht niet overdragen aan de officier die hem aflost indien hij redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat deze laatste kennelijk niet in staat is zijn taken op doeltreffende wijze te vervullen, in welk geval hij de kapitein dienovereenkomstig moet inlichten.    

4.5.2 Bij het overnemen van de wacht moet de aflossende officier zich op de hoogte stellen van de gis of ware positie van het schip, het vastgestelde traject en de vastgestelde koers en vaart bevestigen, en kennisnemen van alle gevaren voor de navigatie waarmee hij tijdens zijn wacht kan worden geconfronteerd.  

4.5.3 Voor zover mogelijk moeten de bewegingen en werkzaamheden tijdens de wacht met betrekking tot de navigatie van het schip nauwkeurig worden vastgelegd.    

4.6 Uitkijk 

4.6.1. Er moet een goede uitkijk worden gehouden in overeenstemming met regel 5 van de Internationale Bepalingen ter voorkoming van aanvaringen op zee, 1972. Het doel hiervan is het volgende: 

.1 het voortdurend waakzaam blijven, door te kijken, te luisteren en met behulp van alle andere beschikbare middelen, om alert te zijn op belangrijke veranderingen in de omgeving;  

.2 het volledig beoordelen van de situatie en het gevaar voor aanvaring, stranding en andere gevaren voor de navigatie; en  

.3 het ontdekken van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in nood, schipbreukelingen, wrakken en wrakstukken.    

4.6.2 Bij het bepalen of de samenstelling van de brugwacht zodanig is dat het houden van een goede uitkijk voortdurend gewaarborgd kan worden, moet de kapitein met alle relevante factoren rekening houden, met inbegrip van die genoemd in paragraaf 4.1 van dit voorschrift, alsmede met de volgende factoren: 

.1 zicht, weersgesteldheid en toestand van de zee;  

.2 verkeersdichtheid en andere activiteiten die plaatsvinden in het gebied waarin het schip vaart;  

.3 de oplettendheid die vereist is bij het varen in of nabij gebieden met verkeersscheidingsstelsels of andere routeringsmaatregelen;  

.4 de aanvullende werkdruk die voortvloeit uit de aard van de werkzaamheden van het schip, de directe operationele vereisten en voorziene manoeuvres;  

.5 besturing van roer en schroef en wijze waarop het schip manoeuvreert;  

.6 geschiktheid voor de dienst van oproepbare bemanningsleden die voor de brugwacht kunnen worden aangewezen;  

.7 kennis van en vertrouwen in de beroepsbekwaamheid van de officieren en bemanningsleden van het schip;  

.8 de ervaring van de officier die belast is met de brugwacht en de mate waarin die officier vertrouwd is met de apparatuur, procedures en manoeuvreerbaarheid van het schip;  

.9 de activiteiten die op enig moment plaatsvinden aan boord van het schip en de beschikbaarheid van assistentie die indien nodig terstond naar de brug kan worden geroepen;  

.10 de operationele status van de instrumenten op de brug en de stuurinrichting, met inbegrip van de alarmsystemen;  

.11 de omvang van het schip en het gezichtsveld vanaf de stuurpositie;  

.12 de configuratie van de brug, met name de wijze waarop de configuratie een lid van de brugwacht zou kunnen belemmeren ontwikkelingen buiten te zien of te horen; en  

.13 alle relevante normen, procedures en richtsnoeren die betrekking hebben op wachtregelingen en geschiktheid voor de dienst die door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen.      

4.7 Bescherming van het mariene milieu De kapitein en de officier van de wacht moeten zich bewust zijn van de ernstige gevolgen van verontreiniging van het mariene milieu ten gevolge van de bedrijfsvoering van het schip of van een ongeval, en moeten alle mogelijke voorzorgsmaatregelen nemen om een dergelijke verontreiniging te voorkomen, in het bijzonder in het kader van de desbetreffende internationale voorschriften en havenvoorschriften.  

4.8 Weersomstandigheden De officier van de wacht neemt alle relevante maatregelen en waarschuwt de kapitein wanneer verslechterende weersomstandigheden de veiligheid van het schip nadelig zouden kunnen beïnvloeden, met inbegrip van omstandigheden die tot ijsafzetting leiden.    

5. Varen onder loodsaanwijzing De aanwezigheid van een loods aan boord ontheft de kapitein of officier van de wacht niet van hun taken en verplichtingen in verband met de veiligheid van het schip. De kapitein en de loods moeten gegevens uitwisselen met betrekking tot de te voeren navigatie, de plaatselijke omstandigheden en de eigenschappen van het schip. De kapitein en de officier van de wacht moeten nauw met de loods samenwerken en de positie en bewegingen van het schip nauwgezet blijven controleren.  

6. Schepen die betrokken zijn bij de visvangst of op zoek zijn naar vis 

6.1 Naast de in paragraaf 4 genoemde beginselen, houdt de officier van de wacht rekening met de volgende factoren en neemt aan de hand daarvan de juiste maatregelen: 

.1 andere schepen die betrokken zijn bij de visvangst en hun vistuig, de manoeuvreerkenmerken van het eigen schip, met name de stopafstand en de diameter van de draaicirkel bij gewone vaart en met visgerei buiten boord.  

.2 de veiligheid van de bemanning aan dek;  

.3 de nadelige gevolgen voor de veiligheid van het schip en zijn bemanning als gevolg van verminderde stabiliteit en vrijboord die veroorzaakt worden door de uitzonderlijke krachten die resulteren uit de visvangst, behandeling en stuwage van de vangst, en ongebruikelijke zee- en weersomstandigheden;  

.4 de nabijheid van offshore-constructies, met bijzondere aandacht voor veiligheidszones; en  

.5 wrakken en obstakels onderwater die een gevaar voor het visgerei zouden kunnen opleveren.    

6.2 Bij het stuwen van de vangst wordt aandacht besteed aan de essentiële vereisten voor voldoende vrijboord, stabiliteit en waterdichtheid op elk moment tijdens de reis naar de aanlandingshaven, rekening houdend met het verbruik van brandstof en scheepsvoorraad, het risico van slechte weersomstandigheden en, met name in de winter, het risico van ijsafzetting op of boven blootgestelde dekken waarop ijsafzetting waarschijnlijk is.    

7. Ankerwacht De kapitein waarborgt, met het oog op de veiligheid van het schip en zijn bemanning, dat er te allen tijde een goede wacht wordt gehouden op de brug of aan dek van vissersschepen die voor anker liggen.  

8. Radioluisterwacht De kapitein waarborgt dat een adequate radioluisterwacht wordt gehouden wanneer het schip op zee is, op de juiste frequenties, rekening houdend met de vereisten van het Radioreglement.
