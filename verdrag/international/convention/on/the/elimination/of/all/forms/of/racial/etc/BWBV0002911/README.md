The States Parties to this Convention, Considering that the Charter of the United Nations is based on the principles of the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings, and that all Member States have pledged themselves to take joint and separate action, in co-operation with the Organization, for the achievement of one of the purposes of the United Nations which is to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that air human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race, colour or national origin, Considering that all human beings are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law against any discrimination and against any incitement to discrimination, Considering that the United Nations has condemned colonialism and all practices of segregation and discrimination associated therewith, in whatever form and wherever they exist, and that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 14 December 1960 (General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)) has affirmed and solemnly proclaimed the necessity of bringing them to a speedy and unconditional end, Considering that the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 20 November 1963 (General Assembly resolution 1904 (XVIII)) solemnly affirms the necessity of speedily eliminating racial discrimination throughout the world in all its forms and manifestations and of securing understanding of and respect for the dignity of the human person, Convinced that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere, Reaffirming that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples and the harmony of persons living side by side even within one and the same State, Convinced that the existence of racial barriers is repugnant to the ideals of any human society, Alarmed by manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence in some areas of the world and by governmental policies based on racial superiority or hatred, such as policies of apartheid, segregation or separation, Resolved to adopt all necessary measures for speedily eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices in order to promote understanding between races and to build an international community free from all forms of racial segregation and racial discrimination, Bearing in mind the Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1958, and the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1960, Desiring to implement the principles embodied in the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and to secure the earliest adoption of practical measures to that end, Have agreed as follows:

####Internationaal Verdrag inzake de uitbanning van alle vormen van rassendiscriminatie

De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, Overwegende, dat het Handvest der Verenigde Naties is gegrondvest op de beginselen van de waardigheid en de gelijkheid van alle mensen, en dat alle Lid-Staten zich plechtig hebben verbonden om, in samenwerking met de organisatie, gemeenschappelijk en elk voor zich te streven naar de verwezenlijking van een der doelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties, namelijk te bevorderen en aan te moedigen dat de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden ten aanzien van allen overal ter wereld daadwerkelijk worden geëerbiedigd zonder onderscheid naar ras, geslacht, taal of godsdienst, Overwegende, dat de Universele Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens plechtig verkondigt dat alle mensen vrij en gelijk in waardigheid en rechten worden geboren en dat een ieder aanspraak heeft op alle rechten en vrijheden die daarin worden vermeld, zonder enig onderscheid, in het bijzonder wat betreft ras, huidskleur of nationale afkomst, Overwegende, dat alle mensen gelijk zijn voor de wet en aanspraak hebben op gelijke bescherming door de wet tegen elke vorm van discriminatie en tegen elke vorm van aanzetting daartoe, Overwegende, dat de Verenigde Naties het kolonialisme en alle daarmede samengaande praktijken van rassenscheiding en rassendiscriminatie, ongeacht de vorm waarin en de plaats waar deze voorkomen, hebben veroordeeld en dat in de Verklaring inzake het verlenen van onafhankelijkheid aan gekoloniseerde landen en volkeren van 14 december 1960 (Resolutie 1514 (XV) van de Algemene Vergadering) de noodzaak hieraan terstond en onvoorwaardelijk een einde te maken, werd bevestigd en plechtig verkondigd, Overwegende, dat in de Verklaring van de Verenigde Naties van 20 november 1963 (Resolutie 1904 (XVIII) van de Algemene Vergadering) inzake de uitbanning van alle vormen van discriminatie de noodzaak van onmiddellijke uitbanning van alle vormen en uitingen van rassendiscriminatie over de gehele wereld en van het verzekeren van begrip en eerbied voor de waardigheid van de mens plechtig wordt bevestigd, Ervan overtuigd, dat elke leer die uitgaat van de superioriteit van een bepaald ras, wetenschappelijk onjuist, op zedelijke gronden verwerpelijk en sociaal onrechtvaardig en gevaarlijk is, en dat rassendiscriminatie nergens, noch op theoretische, noch op praktische gronden, te verdedigen is, Opnieuw bevestigend dat discriminatie tussen mensen op grond van ras, huidskleur of etnische afstamming een belemmering vormt voor vriendschappelijke en vreedzame betrekkingen tussen de naties, en de vrede en veiligheid tussen de volkeren en de goede verstandhouding tussen de mensen, ook binnen een en dezelfde Staat, kan verstoren, Ervan overtuigd, dat het bestaan van scheidsmuren tussen de rassen indruist tegen de idealen van elke mensengemeenschap, Verontrust door de uitingen van rassendiscriminatie die nog in verschillende delen van de wereld kunnen worden waargenomen en door het beleid van sommige regeringen dat is gebaseerd op superioriteit van ras of op rassenhaat, zoals de apartheidspolitiek of een andere politiek van rassenscheiding, Vastbesloten alle maatregelen te nemen die nodig zijn om snel een einde te maken aan alle vormen en alle uitingen van rassendiscriminatie, alsook op rassendiscriminatie berustende leerstellingen en praktijken te voorkomen en te bestrijden, ten einde een betere verstandhouding tussen de rassen te bevorderen en een internationale samenleving op te bouwen waarin zich geen enkele vorm van rassenscheiding en rassendiscriminatie voordoet, Gelet op het Verdrag betreffende discriminatie in beroep en beroepsuitoefening, dat in 1958 is aangenomen door de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie en op het Verdrag nopens de bestrijding van discriminatie in het onderwijs, dat in 1960 is aangenomen door de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur, Verlangend uitvoering te geven aan de beginselen, neergelegd in de Verklaring van de Verenigde Naties inzake de uitbanning van alle vormen van rassendiscriminatie en te bewerkstelligen dat daarop gerichte praktische maatregelen op zo kort mogelijke termijn worden aanvaard, Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:     
### DEEL  I  

### Artikel  1  

1.  In dit Verdrag wordt onder „rassendiscriminatie” verstaan elke vorm van onderscheid, uitsluiting, beperking of voorkeur op grond van ras, huidskleur, afkomst of nationale of etnische afstamming die ten doel heeft de erkenning, het genot of de uitoefening, op voet van gelijkheid, van de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden op politiek, economisch, sociaal of cultureel gebied, of op andere terreinen van het openbare leven, teniet te doen of aan te tasten, dan wel de tenietdoening of aantasting daarvan ten gevolge heeft.   
2.  Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op vormen van onderscheid, uitsluiting, beperking of voorkeur die door een Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag in acht worden genomen tussen onderdanen en niet-onderdanen.   
3.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag mag zodanig worden uitgelegd dat de wettelijke bepalingen van de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, voor zover deze bepalingen op nationaliteit, staatsburgerschap of naturalisatie betrekking hebben, daardoor op enigerlei wijze worden aangetast, mits zij geen discriminatie inhouden ten aanzien van een bepaalde nationaliteit.   
4.  Bijzondere maatregelen die uitsluitend zijn genomen voor de behoorlijke ontwikkeling van bepaalde rasgemeenschappen, etnische groepen of personen die bescherming behoeven om hun een gelijk genot of de gelijke uitoefening van de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden te verzekeren, worden niet als rassendiscriminatie aangemerkt, mits deze maatregelen niet tot gevolg hebben dat voor verschillende rasgemeenschappen afzonderlijke rechten in stand worden gehouden en zij niet van kracht blijven nadat de oogmerken waarmede zij zijn genomen, zijn bereikt.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag veroordelen rassendiscriminatie en nemen de verplichting op zich onverwijld en met alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende middelen een beleid te zullen voeren dat erop is gericht alle vormen van rassendiscriminatie uit te bannen en een goede verstandhouding tussen alle rassen te bevorderen en, met het oog daarop:

2.  Indien de aangelegenheid niet binnen zes maanden na ontvangst door de ontvangende Staat van de eerste kennisgeving ten genoegen van beide Partijen is geregeld, hetzij door bilaterale onderhandelingen, hetzij langs andere hun openstaande wegen, heeft elk der beide Staten het recht de zaak wederom aan de Commissie voor te leggen, door daarvan zowel aan de Commissie als aan de andere Staat kennis te geven.

De leden van de Conciliatiecommissie worden benoemd met unanieme instemming van de partijen bij het geschil; de betrokken Staten kunnen van haar goede diensten gebruik maken om, op basis van eerbiediging van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, tot een minnelijke schikking van de zaak te komen.  

(b) Indien de partijen bij het geschil niet binnen drie maanden overeenstemming bereiken met betrekking tot de samenstelling van de gehele Conciliatiecommissie of een deel ervan, worden de leden van de Conciliatiecommissie ten aanzien van wie de partijen bij het geschil geen overeenstemming hebben bereikt, bij geheime stemming met een twee derde meerderheid door de Commissie uit haar eigen leden gekozen.     
2.  De leden van de Conciliatiecommissie treden op in hun persoonlijke hoedanigheid. Zij mogen niet de nationaliteit bezitten van de partijen bij het geschil of van een Staat die geen partij is bij dit Verdrag.

8.  De door de Commissie bijeengebrachte en geverifieerde inlichtingen worden ter kennis gebracht van de Conciliatiecommissie; deze kan de betrokken Staten verzoeken nadere op de zaak betrekking hebbende inlichtingen te verstrekken.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  Wanneer de Conciliatiecommissie de zaak volledig heeft bestudeerd, legt zij haar bevindingen inzake alle feiten die betrekking hebben op het geschil tussen de partijen neer in een verslag dat tevens de aanbevelingen bevat die zij nuttig oordeelt met het oog op een minnelijke schikking van het geschil; dit verslag legt zij voor aan de voorzitter van de Commissie.

2.  Elke Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en een verklaring heeft afgelegd als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel kan binnen zijn nationale rechtsstelsel een orgaan instellen of aanwijzen dat bevoegd is verzoekschriften te ontvangen en te bestuderen afkomstig van onder zijn rechtsmacht staande personen of groepen personen die beweren het slachtoffer te zijn van een schending van een of meer der in dit Verdrag genoemde rechten en die de overige beschikbare lokale rechtsmiddelen hebben uitgeput.   
3.  Een verklaring die is afgelegd overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel en de naam van een orgaan dat is ingesteld of aangewezen overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel worden door de desbetreffende Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties, die daarvan afschriften zendt aan de overige Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. Een verklaring kan te allen tijde worden ingetrokken door middel van een daartoe strekkende kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal, doch een zodanige intrekking is niet van invloed op mededelingen die reeds bij de Commissie aanhangig zijn.   
4.  Door het overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel ingestelde of aangewezen orgaan wordt een register van verzoekschriften aangehouden, waarvan voor eensluidend gewaarmerkte afschriften jaarlijks langs de daarvoor gebruikelijke weg bij de Secretaris-Generaal worden nedergelegd, onder voorwaarde dat de inhoud niet openbaar wordt gemaakt.

(a) De Commissie brengt elke te harer kennis gebrachte mededeling vertrouwelijk onder de aandacht van de Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en waarvan wordt beweerd dat hij een bepaling van dit Verdrag overtreedt, doch de identiteit van de betrokken persoon of groep personen wordt zonder de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van deze persoon of personen niet onthuld. De Commissie neemt geen anonieme mededelingen in ontvangst.  

(b) De ontvangende Staat legt binnen drie maanden aan de Commissie een schriftelijke uiteenzetting of verklaring voor, ter toelichting van de zaak, en deelt haar mede welke maatregelen eventueel door die Staat bij wijze van correctie zijn genomen.

(a) De Commissie onderzoekt de mededelingen in het licht van alle haar door de betrokken Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en de indiener van het verzoekschrift ter beschikking gestelde gegevens. De Commissie onderzoekt geen mededeling van een indiener van een verzoekschrift dan nadat zij er zich van heeft vergewist dat alle beschikbare nationale rechtsmiddelen heeft uitgeput. Deze regel geldt niet, indien het aanwenden van deze rechtsmiddelen een onredelijk lange tijd in beslag neemt.  

(b) De Commissie zendt haar eventuele suggesties en aanbevelingen aan de betrokken Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en aan de indiener van het Verzoekschrift.     
8.  De Commissie voegt aan haar jaarverslag een samenvatting van de mededelingen toe, alsmede, voor zover dienstig, een samenvatting van de verklaringen en uiteenzettingen van de betrokken Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en van haar eigen suggesties en aanbevelingen.   
9.  De Commissie is uitsluitend bevoegd de in dit artikel bedoelde functies uit te oefenen wanneer ten minste tien Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag zijn gebonden door verklaringen overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel.
