####International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 (1992 Liability Convention)

The States Parties to the present Convention, Conscious of the dangers of pollution posed by the worldwide maritime carriage of oil in bulk, Convinced of the need to ensure that adequate compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by pollution resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from ships, Desiring to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation in such cases,   Have agreed als follows:    

### Article  I  

For the purposes of this Convention: 

1. “Ship” means any sea-going vessel and seaborne craft of any type whatsoever constructed or adapted for the carriage of oil in bulk as cargo, provided that a ship capable of carrying oil and other cargoes shall be regarded as a ship only when it is actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo and during any voyage following such carriage unless it is proved that it has no residues of such carriage of oil in bulk aboard.  

2. “Person” means any individual or partnership or any public or private body, whether corporate or not, including a State or any of its constituent subdivisions.  

3. “Owner” means the person or persons registered as the owner of the ship or, in the absence of registration, the person or persons owning the ship. However in the case of a ship owned by a State and operated by a company which in that State is registered as the ship's operator, “owner” shall mean such company.  

4. “State of the ship's registry” means in relation to registered ships the State of registration of the ship, and in relation to unregistered ships the State whose flag the ship is flying.  

5. “Oil” means any persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil, whether carried on board a ship as cargo or in the bunkers of such a ship.  

6. “Pollution damage” means: 

(a) loss or damage caused outside the ship by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge may occur, provided that compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken;  

(b) the costs of preventive measures and further loss or damage caused by preventive measures.    

7. “Preventive measures” means any reasonable measures taken by any person after an incident has occurred to prevent or minimize pollution damage.  

8. “Incident” means any occurrence, or series of occurrences having the same origin, which causes pollution damage or creates a grave and imminent threat of causing such damage.  

9. “Organization” means the International Maritime Organization.  

10. “1969 Liability Convention” means the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969. For States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to that Convention, the term shall be deemed to include the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by that Protocol.    

### Article  II  

This Convention shall apply exclusively: 

(a) to pollution damage caused: 

(i) in the territory, including the territorial sea, of a Contracting State, and  

(ii) in the exclusive economic zone of a Contracting State, established in accordance with international law, or, if a Contracting State has not established such a zone, in an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that State determined by that State in accordance with international law and extending not more than 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured;    

(b) to preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage.    

### Article  III  

1.  Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or, where the incident consists of a series of occurrences, at the time of the first such occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by the ship as a result of the incident.   
2.  No liability for pollution damage shall attach to the owner if he proves that the damage: 

(a) resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character, or  

(b) was wholly caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause damage by a third party, or  

(c) was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function.     
3.  If the owner proves that the pollution damage resulted wholly or partially either from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the negligence of that person, the owner may be exonerated wholly or partially from his liability to such person.   
4.  No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention. Subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, no claim for compensation for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may be made against: 

(a) the servants or agents of the owner of the members of the crew;  

(b) the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services for the ship;  

(c) any charterer (howsoever described, including a bareboat charterer), manager of operator of the ship;

(e) any person taking preventive measures;  

(f) all servants or agents of persons mentioned in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e);   unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.   
5.  Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse of the owner against third parties.   

### Article  IV  

When an incident involving two or more ships occurs and pollution damage results therefrom, the owners of all the ships concerned, unless exonerated under Article III, shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not reasonably separable.  

### Article  V  

1.  The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows: 

(a) 4,510,000 units of account for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage;  

(b) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, for each additional unit of tonnage, 631 units of account in addition to the amount mentioned in subparagraph (a);   provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 89,770,000 units of account.   
2.  The owner shall not be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.   
3.  For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of limitation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX or, if no action is brought, with any Court or other competent authority in any one of the Contracting States in which an action can be brought under Article IX. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the Contracting Statewhere the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by theCourt or other competent authority.   
4.  The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims.   
5.  If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his servants or agents or any person providing him insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for pollution damage, such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.   
6.  The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage which he may have paid but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.   
7.  Where the owner or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation under paragraphs 5 or 6 of this Article, had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Count or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.   
8.  Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimize pollution damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.   
9. 
(a). The "unit of account" referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund referred to in paragraph 3. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is not a member of the Internationalry Fund shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.  

(b). Nevertheless, a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9(a) shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.  

(c). The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in paragraph 1 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 9(a). Contracting States shall commuate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(b) as the ase may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.     
10.  For the purpose of this Article the ship's tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.   
11.  The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this Article on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted by the owner. Such a fund may be constituted even if, under the provisions of paragraph 2, the owner is not entitled to limit his liability, but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any claimant against the owner.   

### Article  VI  

1.  Where the owner, after an incident, has constituted a fund in accordance with Article V, and is entitled to limit his liability, 

(a) no person having a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident shall be entitled to exercise any right against any other assets of the owner in respect of such claim;  

(b) the Court or other competent authority of any Contracting State shall order the release of any ship or other property belonging to the owner which has been arrested in respect of a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident, and shall similarly release any bail or other security furnished to avoid such arrest.     
2.  The foregoing shall, however, only apply if the claimant has access to the Court administering the fund and the fund is actually available in respect of his claim.   

### Article  VII  

1.  The owner of a ship registered in a Contracting State and carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or a certificate delivered by an international compensation fund, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1 to cover his liability for pollution damage under this Convention.   
2.  A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a Contracting State has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a Contracting State such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a Contracting State it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any Contracting State. This certificate shall be in the form of the annexed model and shall contain the following particulars: 

(a) name of ship and port of registration;  

(b) name and principal place of business of owner;  

(c) type of security;  

(d) name and principal place of business of insurer or other person giving security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or security is established;  

(e) period of validity of certificate which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other security.     
3.  The certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is neither English nor French, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages.   
4.  The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a Contracting State, with the authorities of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.   
5.  An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate under paragraph 2 of this Article, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.   
6.  The State of registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.   
7.  Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a Contracting State in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other Contracting States for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a Contracting State. A Contracting State may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.   
8.  Any claim for compensation for pollution damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the owner's liability for pollution damage. In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limit his liability according to Article V, paragraph 2, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1. He may further avail himself of the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner himself would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the defendant may avail himself of the defence that the pollution damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner himself, but the defendant shall not avail himself of any other defence which he might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against him. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.   
9.  Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.   
10.  A Contracting State shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to trade unless a certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12 of this Article.   
11.  Subject to the provisions of this Article, each Contracting State shall ensure, under its national legislation, that insurance or other security to the extent specified in paragraph 1 of this Article is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an offshore terminal in its territorial sea, if the ship actually carries more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo.   
12.  If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a Contracting State, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship's liability is covered within the limits prescribed by Article V, paragraph 1. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as practicable the model prescribed by paragraph 2 of this Article.   

### Article  VIII  

Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be extinguished unless an action is brought thereunder within three years from the date when the damage occurred. However, in no case shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the incident which caused the damage. Where this incident consists of a series of occurrences, the six years' period shall run from the date of the first such occurrence.  

### Article  IX  

1.  Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory, including the territorial sea or an area referred to in Article II, of one or more Contracting States or preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution damage in such territory including the territorial sea or area, actions for compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.   
2.  Each Contracting State shall ensure that its Courts possess the necessary jurisdiction to entertain such actions for compensation.   
3.  After the fund has been constituted in accordance with Article V the Courts of the State in which the fund is constituted shall be exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to the.apportionment and distribution of the fund.   

### Article  X  

1.  Any judgment given by a Court with jurisdiction in accordance with Article IX which is enforceable in the State of origin where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be recognized in any Contracting State, except: 

(a) where the judgment was obtained by fraud; or  

(b) where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present his case.     
2.  A judgment recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be enforceable in each Contracting State as soon as the formalities required in that State have been complied with. The formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.   

### Article  XI  

1.  The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to warships or other ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on Government non-commercial service.   
2.  With respect to ships owned by a Contracting State and used for commercial purposes, each State shall be subject to suit in the jurisdictions set forth in Article IX and shall waive all defences based on its status as a sovereign State.   

### Article  XII  

This Convention shall supersede any International Conventions in force or open for signature, ratification or accession at the date on which the Convention is opened for signature, but only to the extent that such Conventions would be in conflict with it; however, nothing in this Article shall affect the obligations of Contracting States to non-Contracting States arising under such International Conventions.  

### Article  XII bis  

####Transitional provisions

The following transitional provisions shall apply in the case of a State which at the time of an incident is a Party both to this Convention and to the 1969 Liability Convention:

(b) where an incident has caused pollution damage within the scope of this Convention, and the State is a Party both to this Convention and to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, liability remaining to be discharged after the application of subparagraph (a) of this Article shall arise under this Convention only to the extent that pollution damage remains uncompensated after application of the said 1971 Convention;  

(c) in the application of Article III, paragraph 4, of this Convention the expression “this Convention” shall be interpreted as referring to this Convention or the 1969 Liability Convention, as appropriate;  

(d) in the application of Article V, paragraph 3, of this Convention the total sum of the fund to be constituted shall be reduced by the amount by which liability has been deemed to be discharged in ance with subparagraph (a) of this Article.

####Internationaal Verdrag inzake de wettelijke aansprakelijkheid voor schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992 (Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag 1992)

De Staten, Partijen bij dit Verdrag, zich bewust van de gevaren van verontreiniging, verbonden aan het vervoer van olie in bulk over de wereldzeeën, overtuigd van de noodzaak waarborgen te scheppen voor een passende vergoeding aan personen die schade lijden door verontreiniging veroorzaakt door het ontsnappen of doen wegvloeien van olie uit schepen, de wens koesterende eenvormige internationale regels en procedures te aanvaarden voor het nemen van beslissingen in kwesties van aansprakelijkheid en het verschaffen van een passende vergoeding in zodanige gevallen,   zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: 

1. wordt onder „schip” verstaan: alle zeeschepen en andere zeegaande vaartuigen, van welk type ook, gebouwd of aangepast voor het vervoer van olie in bulk als lading, met dien verstande dat een schip dat olie en andere soorten lading kan vervoeren alleen als een schip wordt beschouwd, wanneer het daadwerkelijk olie in bulk als lading vervoert en tijdens iedere reis na een zodanig vervoer, tenzij wordt aangetoond dat het geen residuen van zulk vervoer van olie in bulk aan boord heeft.  

2. wordt onder „persoon” verstaan iedere natuurlijke persoon of maatschap, alsmede ieder publiekrechtelijk of privaatrechtelijk lichaam, al of niet rechtspersoonlijkheid bezittend, hieronder begrepen een Staat of zijn staatsrechtelijke onderdelen;  

3. wordt onder „eigenaar” verstaan: de persoon of personen die als eigenaar van het schip zijn teboekgesteld of, indien er geen teboekstelling heeft plaatsgehad, de persoon of personen, die het schip in eigendom hebben. Indien evenwel een schip eigendom is van een Staat en geëxploiteerd wordt door een maatschappij die in die Staat teboekstaat als de exploitant van het schip, betekent „eigenaar” een zodanige maatschappij;  

4. wordt onder „Staat waarin het schip is teboekgesteld” verstaan ten aanzien van teboekgestelde schepen: de Staat waarin het schip is teboekgesteld, en ten aanzien van niet teboekgestelde schepen: de Staat onder wiens vlag het schip vaart;  

5. wordt onder „olie” verstaan: alle persistente uit koolwaterstoffen bestaande minerale oliën, zoals ruwe olie, stookolie, zware dieselolie en smeerolie, vervoerd aan boord van een schip als lading of in de bunkers van het schip.  

6. wordt onder „schade door verontreiniging” verstaan: 

a. verlies of schade buiten het schip veroorzaakt door bevuiling ten gevolge van het ontsnappen of doen wegvloeien van olie uit het schip, waar zulk ontsnappen of doen wegvloeien ook mag plaatsvinden, met dien verstande dat vergoeding voor andere schade aan het milieu dan winstderving ten gevolge van deze schade wordt beperkt tot de kosten van redelijke maatregelen tot herstel die daadwerkelijk worden ondernomen of zullen worden ondernomen.  

b. de kosten van preventieve maatregelen alsmede verlies of schade veroorzaakt door die maatregelen;    

7. wordt onder „preventieve maatregelen” verstaan: alle na het voorval door een persoon genomen redelijke maatregelen ter voorkoming of beperking van de schade door verontreiniging;  

8. wordt onder „voorval” verstaan: elk feit of elke opeenvolging van feiten met dezelfde oorzaak, waardoor schade door verontreiniging wordt veroorzaakt, of waardoor een ernstige en onmiddellijke dreiging ontstaat dat zulk een schade zal worden veroorzaakt.  

9. wordt onder „Organisatie” verstaan: de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie.  

10. wordt onder het „Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969” verstaan: het Internationaal Verdrag inzake de wettelijke aansprakelijkheid voor schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1969. Voor Partijen bij het Protocol van 1976 bij dit Verdrag, wordt met deze term bedoeld het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dat Protocol.    

### Artikel  II  

Dit Verdrag is uitsluitend van toepassing op: 

a. schade door verontreiniging veroorzaakt: 

i. op het grondgebied, de territoriale zee daaronder begrepen, van een Verdragsluitende Staat, en  

ii. binnen de exclusieve economische zone van een Verdragsluitende Staat, vastgesteld overeenkomstig het internationale recht, of, indien een Verdragsluitende Staat een zodanige zone niet heeft vastgesteld, binnen een gebied buiten en grenzend aan de territoriale zee van die Staat, door die Staat vastgesteld overeenkomstig het internationale recht en dat zich niet verder uitstrekt dan 200 zeemijl van de basislijnen waarvan de breedte van zijn territoriale zee wordt gemeten;    

b. preventieve maatregelen, waar ook genomen, ter voorkoming of ter beperking van zodanige schade.    

### Artikel  III  

1.  De eigenaar van het schip op het tijdstip van het voorval, of, zo het voorval bestaat uit een opeenvolging van feiten, op het tijdstip van het eerste feit, is, behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede en het derde lid van dit artikel, aansprakelijk voor schade door verontreiniging, veroorzaakt door het schip als gevolg van het voorval.   
2.  De eigenaar is niet aansprakelijk voor schade door verontreiniging, indien hij bewijst dat de schade: 

a) het gevolg is van een oorlogshandeling, vijandelijkheden, burgeroorlog, opstand of een natuurverschijnsel van een uitzonderlijke, onvermijdelijke en onweerstaanbare aard, of  

b) geheel en al werd veroorzaakt door een handelen of nalaten van derden, met het opzet schade te veroorzaken, of  

c) geheel en al werd veroorzaakt door onzorgvuldigheid of een andere onrechtmatige handeling van een Regering of andere autoriteit, verantwoordelijk voor het onderhoud van lichten of andere hulpmiddelen bij de navigatie, in de uitoefening van die functie.     
3.  Indien de eigenaar bewijst dat de schade door verontreiniging geheel of gedeeltelijk het gevolg is van een handelen of nalaten van de persoon, die de schade heeft geleden, met het opzet de schade te veroorzaken, of van de schuld van die persoon, kan de eigenaar geheel of gedeeltelijk worden ontheven van zijn aansprakelijkheid tegenover die persoon.   
4.  Geen vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging kan tegen de eigenaar worden ingesteld anders dan in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag. Onverminderd het bepaalde in het vijfde lid van dit artikel kan noch op grond van dit Verdrag, noch op enige andere grond, een vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging worden ingesteld tegen: 

a. de ondergeschikten of lasthebbers van de eigenaar of de leden van de bemanning;  

b. de loods of enige andere persoon die, zonder lid van de bemanning te zijn, diensten voor het schip verricht;  

c. een bevrachter (hoe ook omschreven, met inbegrip van een rompbevrachter), beheerder of degene in wiens handen de exploitatie van het schip is gelegd;  

d. personen die met instemming van de eigenaar of in opdracht van een bevoegde overheidsinstantie hulpverleningswerkzaamheden verrichten;  

e. personen die preventieve maatregelen nemen;  

f. alle ondergeschikten of lasthebbers van personen genoemd onder c, d en e;   tenzij de schade het gevolg is van hun persoonlijk handelen of nalaten, begaan hetzij met het opzet zodanige schade te veroorzaken hetzij roekeloos en in de wetenschap dat zodanige schade er waarschijnlijk uit zou voortvloeien.   
5.  Geen bepaling in dit Verdrag maakt inbreuk op enig recht van verhaal van de eigenaar tegenover derden.   

### Artikel  IV  

Wanneer zich een voorval voordoet waarbij twee of meer schepen zijn betrokken en er ten gevolge daarvan schade door verontreiniging is ontstaan, zijn de eigenaren van alle betrokken schepen, tenzij zij ingevolge artikel III van aansprakelijkheid zijn ontheven, hoofdelijk aansprakelijk voor alle schade die redelijkerwijs niet te scheiden is.  

### Artikel  V  

1.  De eigenaar van een schip kan zijn aansprakelijkheid uit hoofde van dit Verdrag per voorval beperken tot een totaal bedrag dat als volgt wordt berekend: 

a. 4.510.000 rekeneenheden voor een schip met een bratotonnage van niet meer dan 5000;  

b. voor een schip met een grotere brutotonnage, voor elke toename van de brutotonnage met één, 631 rekeneenheden boven het onder a genoemde bedrag;   met dien verstande evenwel dat dit bedrag in geen geval in totaal 89.770.000 rekeneenheden te boven kan gaan.   
2.  De eigenaar is niet gerechtigd zijn aansprakelijkheid ingevolge dit Verdrag te beperken indien wordt bewezen dat de schade door verontreiniging het gevolg is van zijn persoonlijk handelen of nalaten, begaan hetzij met het opzet zodanige schade te veroorzaken, hetzij roekeloos en in de wetenschap dat zodanige schade er waarschijnlijk uit zou voortvloeien.   
3.  Ten einde zich te kunnen beroepen op de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde beperking, moet de eigenaar een fonds vormen tot een bedrag gelijk aan het maximum van zijn aansprakelijkheid bij de rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat binnen wiens grondgebied een vordering op grond van artikel IX wordt ingesteld, of, indien geen vordering wordt ingesteld, bij een rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat binnen wiens grondgebied een vordering op grond van artikel IX kan worden ingesteld. Het fonds kan worden gevormd door het storten van de geldsom of door het stellen van een bankgarantie of iedere andere garantie welke aanvaardbaar is volgens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staat waar het fonds wordt gevormd en welke door de rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteit genoegzaam wordt geacht.   
4.  Het fonds wordt verdeeld onder de schuldeisers in evenredigheid met de bedragen van hun erkende vorderingen.   
5.  Indien vóór de verdeling van het fonds de eigenaar of een van zijn ondergeschikten of lasthebbers, of een persoon die hem een verzekering of andere zekerheid heeft verschaft, in verband met het voorval een vergoeding terzake van schade door verontreiniging hebben betaald, treden deze personen bij wege van subrogatie, tot het bedrag dat zij hebben betaald, in de rechten die de door hen schadeloos gestelde persoon op grond van dit Verdrag zou hebben gehad.   
6.  Het recht van subrogatie, bedoeld in het vijfde lid van dit artikel kan ook worden uitgeoefend door andere dan de daarin genoemde personen met betrekking tot enige vergoeding voor schade door verontreiniging die zij mochten hebben betaald, maar alleen voor zover een zodanige subrogatie is geoorloofd volgens de toepasselijke nationale wetgeving.   
7.  Wanneer de eigenaar of enige andere persoon aantoont dat hij gedwongen zou kunnen worden op een later tijdstip geheel of ten dele een zodanige schadevergoeding te betalen terzake waarvan hij, indien de vergoeding zou zijn betaald vóór de verdeling van het fonds, ingevolge het vijfde of het zesde lid van dit artikel bij wege van subrogatie rechten zou hebben verkregen, dan kan de rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteit bevelen dat voorlopig een bedrag wordt terzijde gesteld dat voldoende is om het deze persoon mogelijk te maken op een later tijdstip zijn rechten tegen het fonds geldend te maken.   
8.  Vorderingen die betrekking hebben op door de eigenaar vrijwillig en binnen de grenzen der redelijkheid gedane uitgaven en gebrachte offers ter voorkoming of beperking van schade door verontreiniging staan in rang gelijk met andere vorderingen op het fonds.   
9.  

a. De „rekeneenheid” bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel is het bijzondere trekkingsrecht zoals dit is omschreven door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds. De in het eerste lid genoemde bedragen worden omgerekend in een nationale munteenheid volgens de waarde van die munteenheid ten opzichte van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht op de datum van de vorming van het in het derde lid bedoelde fonds. De waarde van de nationale munteenheid, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, van een Verdragsluitende Staat die Lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend overeenkomstig de waarderingsmethode die door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds op de desbetreffende datum wordt toegepast voor zijn eigen verrichtingen en transacties. De waarde van de nationale munteenheid, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, van een Verdragsluitende Staat die geen lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend op een door die Staat vastgestelde wijze.  

b. Niettemin kan een Verdragsluitende Staat die geen Lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en wiens wet de toepassing van de bepalingen van het negende lid, onder a, niet toelaat, op het tijdstip van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring van dan wel toetreding tot dit Verdrag of op enig tijdstip nadien, verklaren dat de in het negende lid, onder a, bedoelde rekeneenheid gelijk zal zijn aan 15 goudfranken. De in dit lid bedoelde goudfrank komt overeen met vijfenzestig en een half milligram goud van een gehalte van negenhonderdduizendste fijn. De omrekening van de goudfrank in de nationale munteenheid geschiedt volgens de wet van de betrokken Staat.  

c. De in de laatste zin van het negende lid, onder a, genoemde berekening en de in het negende lid, onder b, genoemde omrekening geschieden op zodanige wijze dat in de nationale munteenheid van de Verdragsluitende Staat zoveel mogelijk dezelfde werkelijke waarde tot uitdrukking komt voor de bedragen genoemd in het eerste lid als zou voortvloeien uit de toepassing van de eerste drie zinnen van het negende lid, onder a. Bij nederlegging van een akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag en telkens wanneer een verandering optreedt in hun wijze van berekening ingevolge het negende lid, onder a, of in het resultaat van de omrekening ingevolge het negende lid, onder b, delen de Verdragsluitende Staten de depositaris hun wijze van berekening dan wel het resultaat van de omrekening mede.     
10.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel is de brutotonnage van het schip de brutotonnage berekend overeenkomstig de voorschriften voor de meting vervat in Bijlage I van het Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de meting van schepen, 1969.   
11.  De verzekeraar of persoon die financiële zekerheid stelt heeft het recht tot het vormen van een fonds in overeenstemming met dit artikel op dezelfde voorwaarden en met dezelfde rechtsgevolgen als ware het door de eigenaar gevormd. Een zodanig fonds kan zelfs worden gevormd indien, ingevolge het bepaalde in het tweede lid, de eigenaar niet gerechtigd is zijn aansprakelijkheid te beperken, maar de vorming daarvan laat dan de rechten van de schuldeisers tegenover de eigenaar onverlet.   

### Artikel  VI  

1.  Indien na een voorval de eigenaar overeenkomstig artikel V een fonds heeft gevormd en gerechtigd is zijn aansprakelijkheid te beperken, 

(a) zal een persoon die uit dat voorval een vordering wegens schade door verontreiniging heeft, ter zake van die vordering geen rechten kunnen doen gelden op andere goederen van die eigenaar;  

(b) zal de rechterlijke of andere bevoegde autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat de opheffing bevelen van beslag, gelegd op schepen of andere eigendommen van de eigenaar terzake van een vordering tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging voortvloeiende uit dat voorval en op overeenkomstige wijze handelen ten aanzien van borgtocht of andere ter voorkoming van een zodanig beslag gestelde zekerheid.     
2.  Het voorgaande is evenwel alleen van toepassing indien de schuldeiser toegang heeft tot de rechtbank die het fonds beheert en het fonds daadwerkelijk beschikbaar is tot voldoening van zijn vordering.   

### Artikel  VII  

1.  De eigenaar van een in een Verdragsluitende Staat teboekgesteld schip dat meer dan 2000 ton olie in bulk als lading vervoert, is gehouden een verzekering of andere financiële zekerheid, zoals een bankgarantie of een door een internationaal schadefonds afgegeven certificaat in stand te houden tot dekking van zijn aansprakelijkheid voor schade door verontreiniging volgens dit Verdrag, tot een bedrag gelijk aan het maximum van zijn aansprakelijkheid ingevolge het eerste lid van artikel V.   
2.  Een certificaat houdende verklaring dat een overeenkomst van verzekering of een andere financiële zekerheid in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag van kracht is, wordt aan elk schip afgegeven, nadat de bevoegde autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat heeft vastgesteld dat aan de eisen van het eerste lid is voldaan. Met betrekking tot een schip teboekgesteld in een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt zulk een certificaat afgegeven of gewaarmerkt door de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waar het schip is teboekgesteld; met betrekking tot een schip dat niet in een Verdragsluitende Staat is teboekgesteld, kan het worden afgegeven of gewaarmerkt door de bevoegde autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat. Dit certificaat heeft de vorm van het aangehechte model en bevat de navolgende gegevens: 

(a) naam van het schip en van de plaats van teboekstelling;  

(b) naam en adres van de eigenaar en van diens hoofdkantoor;  

(c) soort der zekerheid;  

(d) naam en adres van het hoofdkantoor van de verzekeraar of de persoon die de zekerheid stelt en, waar dienstig, het adres van het kantoor waar de verzekering is gesloten of de zekerheid is gesteld;  

(e) geldigheidsduur van het certificaat, die niet langer kan zijn dan de geldigheidsduur van de verzekering of andere zekerheid.     
3.  Het certificaat wordt gesteld in de officiële taal of de officiële talen van de Staat waar het wordt afgegeven. Indien de gebruikte taal noch de Franse, noch de Engelse is, moet de tekst een vertaling in een van deze talen bevatten,   
4.  Het certificaat moet zich aan boord van het schip bevinden en een afschrift moet worden nedergelegd bij de autoriteiten die het register houden waarin het schip staat teboekgesteld of, indien het schip niet in een Verdragsluitende Staat is teboekgesteld, bij de autoriteiten van de Staat die het certificaat afgeeft of waarmerkt.   
5.  Een verzekering of een andere financiële zekerheid voldoet niet aan de bepalingen van dit artikel, indien zij, om andere redenen dan het verstrijken van haar geldigheidsduur zoals vermeld in het certificaat ingevolge het tweede lid van dit artikel, kan vervallen alvorens drie maanden zijn verlopen sedert de datum waarop aan de autoriteiten bedoeld in het vierde lid van dit artikel mededeling is gedaan van haar beëindiging, tenzij het certificaat bij deze autoriteiten is ingeleverd, dan wel binnen bedoelde termijn een nieuw certificaat is afgegeven. Het vorenstaande is eveneens van toepassing op alle wijzigingen die ten gevolge hebben dat de verzekering of zekerheid niet langer voldoet aan de bepalingen van dit artikel.   
6.  Onverminderd het in dit artikel bepaalde stelt de Staat waar het schip is teboekgesteld de voorwaarden vast betreffende de afgifte en geldigheid van het certificaat.   
7.  Certificaten, afgegeven of gewaarmerkt onder het gezag van een Verdragsluitende Staat overeenkomstig het tweede lid, worden voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag erkend door andere Verdragsluitende Staten, als bezittende dezelfde geldigheid als door deze afgegeven of gewaarmerkte certificaten, zelfs indien zij zijn afgegeven of gewaarmerkt met betrekking tot een schip dat niet in een Verdragsluitende Staat is teboekgesteld. Een Verdragsluitende Staat kan te allen tijde verzoeken om overleg met de Staat die de afgifte of waarmerking verricht, indien hij reden heeft aan te nemen dat de in het certificaat genoemde verzekeraar of degene die de garantie heeft gesteld financieel niet in staat is te voldoen aan de hem door dit Verdrag opgelegde verplichtingen.   
8.  Vorderingen tot vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging kunnen rechtstreeks worden ingesteld tegen de verzekeraar of persoon die financiële zekerheid stelt ter dekking van de aansprakelijkheid van de eigenaar wegens schade door verontreiniging. In dit geval kan de verweerder, zelfs indien de eigenaar overeenkomstig artikel V, tweede lid, niet gerechtigd is zijn aansprakelijkheid te beperken, zich beroepen op de in artikel V, eerste lid, omschreven beperking van aansprakelijkheid. Hij mag voorts zich beroepen op de verweermiddelen (anders dan het faillissement of de liquidatie van de eigenaar) waarop de eigenaar zelf een beroep zou hebben kunnen doen. Voorts kan de verweerder een beroep doen op het verweer dat de schade door verontreiniging het gevolg is van opzettelijk wangedrag van de eigenaar zelf, maar de verweerder kan zich niet beroepen op enig ander verweermiddel dat hij zou hebben kunnen aanvoeren in een door de eigenaar tegen hem aangespannen rechtsgeding. De verweerder heeft steeds het recht te vorderen dat de eigenaar mede in het geding wordt betrokken.   
9.  Gelden uit een verzekering of andere financiële zekerheid, welke ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel wordt in stand gehouden, zijn uitsluitend beschikbaar voor de voldoening van vorderingen ingevolge dit Verdrag.   
10.  Een Verdragsluitende Staat staat niet toe dat onder zijn vlag varende schepen waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, voor de handelsvaart worden gebezigd, tenzij een certificaat is afgegeven ingevolge het tweede of het twaalfde lid van dit artikel.   
11.  Onverminderd het in dit artikel bepaalde moet elke Verdragsluitende Staat er zorg voor dragen dat in zijn nationale wetgeving wordt voorgeschreven dat verzekering of andere zekerheid tot de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde omvang verplicht is voor elk schip, waar ook teboekgesteld, dat een haven op zijn grondgebied binnenloopt of verlaat, dan wel aankomt bij of vertrekt van een buitengaats doch binnen zijn territoriale zee gelegen laad- of losinstallatie, wanneer het schip daadwerkelijk meer dan 2.000 ton olie in bulk als lading vervoert.   
12.  Is met betrekking tot een schip dat in eigendom toebehoort aan een Verdragsluitende Staat geen verzekering afgesloten of geen financiële zekerheid gesteld, dan zijn de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit artikel op dat schip niet van toepassing, maar het schip moet wel zijn voorzien van een certificaat, afgegeven door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staat waar het is teboekgesteld, houdende de verklaring dat het schip eigendom is van de Staat en dat de aansprakelijkheid voor het schip gedekt is binnen de grenzen van artikel V, eerste lid. Dit certificaat wordt zoveel mogelijk opgesteld volgens het In het tweede lid van dit artikel voorgeschreven model.   

### Artikel  VIII  

Het recht op schadevergoeding krachtens dit Verdrag vervalt wanneer niet binnen drie jaar na de datum waarop de schade is ontstaan een rechtsvordering is ingesteld. In geen geval kan echter een rechtsvordering worden ingesteld nadat zes jaar zijn verstreken na de datum van het voorval dat de schade heeft veroorzaakt. Indien dit voorval wordt gevormd door een opeenvolging van feiten, loopt de termijn van zes jaar van de datum van het eerste feit.  

### Artikel  IX  

1.  Indien een voorval schade door verontreiniging heeft veroorzaakt op het grondgebied van één of meer Verdragsluitende Staten, de territoriale zee of een gebied zoals bedoeld in artikel II daaronder begrepen, dan wel preventieve maatregelen zijn genomen ter voorkoming of beperking van schade door verontreiniging op dit grondgebied, de territoriale zee of het gebied daaronder begrepen, dan kunnen vorderingen tot schadevergoeding slechts worden ingesteld bij de rechter van die Verdragsluitende Staat of Staten. Van het instellen van zodanige vordering moet aan de verweerder binnen redelijke termijn kennis worden gegeven.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat draagt er zorg voor dat zijn gerechten bevoegd zijn kennis te nemen van deze vorderingen tot schadevergoeding.   
3.  Nadat het fonds overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel V is gevormd, is de rechter van de Staat waar het fonds is gevormd bij uitsluiting bevoegd te beslissen in alle aangelegenheden betreffende de toedeling en verdeling van het fonds.   

### Artikel  X  

1.  Beslissingen van een uit hoofde van artikel IX bevoegde rechter welke voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar zijn in de Staat waar zij zijn gegeven en waartegen geen gewoon rechtsmiddel meer openstaat worden erkend in elke andere Verdragsluitende Staat, tenzij: 

(a) de beslissing is verkregen door bedrog; of  

(b) de verweerder niet binnen een redelijke termijn is verwittigd en niet behoorlijk in de gelegenheid is gesteld zijn zaak uiteen te zetten.     
2.  Een beslissing welke ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel is erkend, is vatbaar voor tenuitvoerlegging in iedere Verdragsluitende Staat, zodra de in die Staat vereiste formaliteiten zijn vervuld. Deze formaliteiten mogen niet leiden tot een hernieuwd onderzoek van de zaak.   

### Artikel  XI  

1.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag zijn niet van toepassing op oorlogsschepen of andere schepen in eigendom van of geëxploiteerd door een Staat ten tijde dat zij alleen worden gebruikt in dienst van de overheid voor andere dan handelsdoeleinden.   
2.

5.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Protocol maar geen Partij is bij het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, is gebonden door de bepalingen van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol, met betrekking tot andere Staten die hierbij Partij zijn, maar is niet gebonden door de bepalingen van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, met betrekking tot Staten die daarbij Partij zijn.

1.  Dit Protocol treedt in werking twaalf maanden na de datum waarop tien Staten, waaronder vier Staten met elk niet minder dan een miljoen brutotonnage van tankschepen, akten van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding hebben nedergelegd bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie.

### Artikel  15

1.  Op verzoek van ten minste een vierde van de Verdragsluitende Staten worden voorstellen tot wijziging van de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen, neergelegd in artikel V, eerste lid, van het Verdrag, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol, door de Secretaris-Generaal toegezonden aan alle Leden van de Organisatie en aan alle Verdragsluitende Staten.   
2.  Elke voorgestelde en zoals hierboven aangegeven toegezonden wijziging wordt voorgelegd aan de Juridische Commissie van de Organisatie ter overweging op een datum tenminste zes maanden na de datum van toezending.   
3.  Alle Verdragsluitende Staten bij het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol, ongeacht of zij Lid van de Organisatie zijn, zijn gerechtigd deel te nemen aan de werkzaamheden van de Juridische Commissie ter overweging en aanneming van wijzigingen.   
4.  Wijzigingen worden aangenomen met een tweederde meerderheid van de Verdragsluitende Staten die aanwezig zijn en hun stem uitbrengen in de Juridische Commissie, welke is uitgebreid zoals bepaald in het derde lid, mits ten minste de helft van de Verdragsluitende Staten aanwezig is op het tijdstip van de stemming.   
5.  Wanneer de Commissie een voorstel tot wijziging van de grenzen bespreekt, houdt zij rekening met de ervaring opgedaan bij voorvallen en in het bijzonder met het bedrag van de daaruit voortvloeiende schade, met wijzigingen in geldswaarden, en de gevolgen van de voorgestelde wijziging voor de kosten van verzekering. Zij houdt voorts rekening met de samenhang van de grenzen van artikel V, eerste lid, van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol en die in artikel 4, vierde lid, van het Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de instelling van een Internationaal Fonds voor vergoeding van schade door verontreiniging door olie, 1992.   
6.  

a. Er mag geen wijziging van de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen ingevolge dit artikel worden overwogen vóór 15 januari 1998, en evenmin binnen vijf jaar vanaf de datum van inwerkingtreding van een voorgaande wijziging ingevolge dit artikel. Er kan geen wijziging ingevolge dit artikel worden overwogen alvorens dit Protocol in werking is getreden.  

b. Er mag geen grens zodanig worden verhoogd dat deze een bedrag overschrijdt dat overeenkomt met de grens vervat in het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol, verhoogd met zes procent per jaar berekend op samengestelde basis vanaf 15 januari 1993.  

c. Er mag geen grens zodanig worden verhoogd, dat deze een bedrag overschrijdt dat overeenkomt met de grens vervat in het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol, vermenigvuldigd met drie.     
7.  Elke wijziging aangenomen overeenkomstig het vierde lid wordt door de Organisatie ter kennis gebracht van alle Verdragsluitende Staten. De wijziging wordt geacht te zijn aanvaard aan het einde van een tijdvak van achttien maanden na de datum van kennisgeving, tenzij binnen dat tijdvak niet minder dan een vierde van de Staten die Verdragsluitende Staten waren op het tijdstip van aanneming van de wijziging door de Juridische Commissie de Organisatie hebben medegedeeld dat zij de wijziging niet aanvaarden, in welk geval de wijziging is verworpen en deze niet van kracht wordt.   
8.  Een wijziging die geacht wordt te zijn aanvaard overeenkomstig het zevende lid, treedt in werking achttien maanden na aanvaarding ervan.   
9.  Alle Verdragsluitende Staten zijn gebonden door de wijziging, tenzij zij ten minste zes maanden voordat de wijziging in werking treedt dit Protocol opzeggen overeenkomstig artikel 16, eerste en tweede lid. Deze opzegging wordt van kracht wanneer de wijziging in werking treedt.   
10.  Wanneer een wijziging door de Juridische Commissie is aangenomen, maar het tijdvak van achttien maanden voor de aanvaarding ervan nog niet is verstreken, is een Staat die gedurende dat tijdvak Verdragsluitende Staat wordt, door de wijziging gebonden indien deze in werking treedt. Een Staat die na dat tijdvak Verdragsluitende Staat wordt, is gebonden door een wijziging die overeenkomstig het zevende lid is aanvaard. In de gevallen bedoeld in dit lid wordt een Staat gebonden door een wijziging wanneer deze wijziging in werking treedt, of wanneer dit Protocol voor die Staat in werking treedt, indien deze datum later valt.

4.  Wat de Partijen bij dit Protocol betreft, wordt opzegging door een van hen van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, overeenkomstig artikel XVI daarvan niet op enigerlei wijze uitgelegd als een opzegging van het Aansprakelijkheidsverdrag, 1969, zoals gewijzigd bij dit Protocol.   
5.  Opzegging van het Protocol van 1992 tot wijziging van het Fondsverdrag, 1971, door een Staat die Partij blijft bij het Fondsverdrag, 1971, wordt geacht een opzegging te zijn van dit Protocol. Die opzegging wordt van kracht op de datum waarop de opzegging van het Protocol van 1992 tot wijziging van het Fondsverdrag, 1971, van kracht wordt overeenkomstig artikel 34 van dat Protocol.
