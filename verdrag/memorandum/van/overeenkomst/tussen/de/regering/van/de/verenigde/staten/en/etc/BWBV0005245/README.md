##Memorandum van Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de Regering van Nederland betreffende Offshore Procurement

### No.  I  

AMERICAN EMBASSY No. 447 The Hague, April 15, 1954 Excellency: I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place between representatives of our two Governments relating to a Memorandum of Understanding and a Model Contract for the United States Offshore Procurement Program in the Netherlands. These discussions resulted in agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding reading as follows: 
### *“Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and the Netherlands Government relating to Offshore Procurement* 

“This Memorandum sets forth certain principles and policies which the Netherlands Government and the Government of the United States have agreed will govern the United States Offshore Procurement Program in the Netherlands. 

“1.  *Scope and Purpose of the Offshore Procurement Program*  “It is the intent of the United States Government under the offshore procurement program to conduct a program of military procurement in countries participating in the Mutual Security Program of those types of materials, services, supplies and equipment appropriate for United States military procurement and required either for the mutual security military aid program or for the direct use of United States Forces. The extent of this program in the Netherlands is dependent upon the ability of the United States Government to place contracts at reasonable prices and with satisfactory delivery dates. It is intended that the carrying out of this program will materially contribute to the combined defense productive capacity of the nations which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Defense Community and will at the same time provide a means for increasing the dollar earnings of these countries. “The United States Government will conduct the offshore procurement program in accordance with the laws of the United States governing military procurement and the Mutual Security Program. It is also the intent of the United States that the offshore procurement program shall be carried out in the Netherlands in furtherance of the principles set forth in Section 516 (A) of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, as amended, the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951, and Article II (3) of the Economic Cooperation Agreement between the Netherlands Government and the Government of the United States of America signed in The Hague on July 2, 1948, as amended.  

“2.  *Intergovernmental Coordination*  “The procurement program of the United States Government of military items in the Netherlands will be coordinated with the defense program of the Netherlands Government as it develops. Appropriate officials of the two governments will consult together on a continuing basis to study production problems and the carrying out of recommendations for the procurement of items required by the United States Government. The two governments will exchange information, as needed, and on a continuing basis, with respect to procurement plans, production facilities in the Netherlands and progress in the achievement of production objectives in the Netherlands. “Copies or abstracts of contracts executed with Netherlands private contractors will be furnished the Netherlands Government by the United States Government.  

“3.  *Contract Placement by Contracting Officers*  “It is understood that offshore procurement contract will be placed and administered on behalf of the United States Government by contracting officers of the United States Military Departments.  

“4.  *Parties to Contracts*  “United States contracting officers may contract with the Netherlands Government or directly with individuals, firms or other legal entities. It is the preference of the Netherlands Government that the United States Government contract directly with individuals, firms or other legal entities.  

“5.  *Contract Assistance*  “The Netherlands Government will, upon request of the contracting officer, provide assistance in the selection of contractors and technical information concerning prospective sub-contractors, and will assist the United States Government and individual contractors, to the extent necessary and appropriate, in the administering and carrying out of offshore procurement contracts.  

“6.  *Supply of Equipment, Materials and Manpower*  “The Netherlands Government will accord to offshore procurement contractors and their sub-contractors priorities for securing equipment, materials, manpower and services equal to those which are accorded contractors having similar types of contracts with the Netherlands Government.  

“7.  *Security*  “In the case of procurement contracts placed by the United States Government with the Netherlands Government, any classified material, including information, delivered by one government to the other, will be given a security classification by the recipient government which will afford to the material substantially the same degree of security as that afforded by the originating government and will be treated by the recipient government as its own classified material of that security grading. The recipient government will not use such material, or permit it to be used, for other than military purposes and will not disclose such material, or permit it to be disclosed, to another nation without the consent of the originating government. In cases of government-to-government contracts which involve the disclosure of top secret information, the Netherlands Government shall, when so requested by the contracting officer, undertake to assist the United States Government in maintaining restricted areas in accordance with Netherlands law concerning 'prohibited places'. “In the case of procurement contracts placed by the United States Government with individuals, firms or other legal entities, security arrangements for classified material will be followed similar to those described in the preceding paragraph. Prior to the placement of the contract, the contracting officer will notify the prospective producer and the Netherlands Government of the security classification of the contract. Classified material of the United States Government needed by a Netherlands contractor will be delivered to the appropriate ministry of the Netherlands Government for transmittal to the contractor. Such material will, prior to transmittal, receive a security classification of the Netherlands Government which will afford to the material substantially the same degree of security as that afforded by the United States Government and at the time of transmittal the Netherlands Government will notify the contractor that the classified material delivered to it is also classified material of the Netherlands Government and is subject to the provisions of the Act on the Protection of Official Secrets. The Netherlands Government undertakes to enforce the security requirements and obligations placed upon private Netherlands contractors in possession of such classified material. “In order to ensure adequate protection of classified information and material, the appropriate ministry of the Netherlands Government will, upon request, conduct a security investigation of any prospective Netherlands contractor with the United States Government in the same manner as such investigations are conducted in cases of defense procurement by the Netherlands Government, and a recommendation resulting from such investigation will be made to the United States Government. “No charges will be made by the Netherlands Government for services rendered by its security services.  

“8.  *Inspection*  “An inspection of all materials, supplies, equipment and services procured by the United States Government in the Netherlands either from the Netherlands Government or Netherlands manufacturers and suppliers shall be carried out by representatives of the Netherlands Government when requested by the United States Government. In such cases, the Netherlands Government will certify to the United States Government that the products meet all specifications and other technical requirements of the contract. As a rule inspection shall not be duplicated. For verification purposes the United States Government representative will be entitled to be present at all inspections performed by the Netherlands Government inspectors and to examine the Netherlands Government Inspection records. The United States Government representatives shall have the right to make independent inspections and verifications, and insofar as feasible, such inspections will be made in company with Netherlands inspectors. As a rule no charges will be made by the Netherlands Government for inspection services, particularly for items produced for delivery to countries which are members of NATO or the EDC. In no event will charges be made for inspection services on items procured by the United States Government for delivery to the Netherlands Government. Should the Netherlands Government find it necessary to charge for inspection services in connection with materials, supplies, equipment or services procured under a contract between the United States Government and the Netherlands Government such inspection charges will be included in the proposed contract price quoted to the United States Government. Should the Netherlands Government find it necessary to charge for inspection services in connection with procurement made directly by the United States Government from private contractors in the Netherlands, the respective Governments will execute a contract to cover such charges. In no event will the charges for inspection exceed the cost thereof to the Netherlands Government.  

“9.  *Credit Arrangements*  “It is understood that the Netherlands Government will assist in providing Netherlands contractors producing for the United States offshore procurement program, treatment concerning commercial bank priorities equal to that accorded to Netherlands business establishments producing for the defense and export program of the Netherlands.  

“10.  *Licenses*  “The Netherlands Government will facilitate the granting or obtaining of, any necessary licenses including exchange control export and import licenses required in connection with any offshore procurement contracts placed in the Netherlands. “The Netherlands Government will also grant and facilitate the obtaining of such licenses in connection with offshore procurement contracts placed by the United States Government in other North Atlantic Treaty or European Defense Community countries unless such other country upon request fails to grant reciprocal treatment with respect to licenses which may be required in connection with offshore procurement contracts placed in the Netherlands.  

“11.  *Taxes*  “The provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement Between the Netherlands Government and the United States Government dated March 7, 1952 are applicable to this program as well as the agreed procedures which have been worked out thereunder by representatives of the two governments. The two governments may consult from time to time as the occasion arises regarding further implementation of that Agreement.  

“12.  *Standard Contract Clauses*  “Standard clauses have been approved by the two governments for use, as appropriate, in contracts between them. Other clauses may be included in individual contracts including but not limited to escalation, advance and progress payment clauses, where appropriate.  

“13.  *Protection of United States Property and Personnel*  “In accordance with the existing law and custom in the Netherlands, any interests of the United States Government in property furnished or acquired through offshore procurement contracts in the Netherlands will be immune from legal liability or process. Likewise, the United States Government is protected against suits or other legal liability in the Netherlands on any matter which may arise out of an offshore procurement contract. “Contracting officers and other authorized procurement personnel who are in the Netherlands in connection with the offshore procurement program and whose names have been duly reported to the Netherlands Government will be accorded the privileges and immunities set forth in paragraphs *(b)* and *(c)* of annex E to the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between the United States and the Netherlands signed at Washington on January 27, 1950 provided that upon entry into force of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and the Netherlands, the status of such contracting officers and other authorized procurement personnel will be reconsidered in the light of the agreement, such other pertinent agreements as may be in force between the two governments and such other considerations as may be appropriate.  

“14.  *Destination of End-Items*  “Although the determination of specifications and other requirements of particular offshore procurement contracts may require the tentative identification of the recipient country for the end-item to be produced, it is understood that, unless otherwise specifically agreed between the two governments In a particular case, the United States may subsequently amend any such prior determination and identification as to which country shall be the ultimate recipient of the end-items produced.  

“15.  *Contract Terms*  “Inasmuch as the statutes of the United States prohibit utilization of a contract upon which payment is based on cost plus a percentage of cost, it is understood that such a system of determining payment shall not be employed in contracts entered into between the United States Government and either private contractors or the Netherlands Government. Further, the Netherlands Government advises that it will not utilize the type of contract in which payment is made on the basis of cost plus a percentage of cost in sub-contracts under any contracts between the United States Government and the Netherlands Government. “For the information of the United States procurement officer the Netherlands Government advises that it does not have any law authorizing the recoupment of excess profit similar to the Renegotiation Act of the United States. The two governments may agree in contracts between them to include provisions limiting the amount of profit of sub-contractors. In such instances, the Government of the Netherlands will pass on to the Government of the United States any profits refunded by such, sub-contractors. Procedures for the determination and recovery of profits will be agreed upon by the two governments.  

“16.  *Reporting of Sub-Contracts*  “On such contracts as are entered into between the Netherlands Government and the United States Government, the Netherlands Government will furnish to the United States contracting officers such information as may be requested regarding the placement by the Netherlands Government of sub-contracts and purchase orders under such government-to-government contracts,.  

“17.  *No Profits Clause*  “On offshore procurement contracts entered into between the United States Government and the Netherlands Government, it is intended that no profit of any nature, including net gains, resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, will be made by the Netherlands Government. The Netherlands Government agrees to determine, prior to December 31, 1954, or at such later date as may be mutually agreed by the governments, whether it has realized any such profit, in which event, or in the event that the United States Government prior to such date considers that such profit may have been realized, the Netherlands Government agrees that it will enter into conversations with the United States Government; for the purpose of determining the existence and the amount of such profit. During these conversations the United States Government shall have access to such documents and accounting data as may be necessary to determine the facts. In the computation of profits hereunder, the contracts shall be taken collectively, and allowances will be made for the increases in costs to the Netherlands Government which may have arisen out of the contracts due to a fluctuation of exchange rates. If as a result of conversations between the respective governments it is established that a collective net profit has been realized by the Netherlands Government, it shall refund the amount of such profit to the United States. Government under arrangements and procedures to be agreed upon between the two governments. “This article shall not be construed as affecting in any manner such profit refunding provisions as may be contained in individual contracts.”   Agreement was also reached on the standard clauses, referred to in Article 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding, which have been incorporated into a Model Contract. A copy of this Contract is Enclosure No. 1 to this Note. This note and Your Excellency's affirmative reply will constitute agreement on this matter which shall enter into force on the date the Embassy of the United States of America is notified that the approval constitutionally required in the Netherlands has been obtained. Meanwhile, I suggest that the parties to the present agreement shall apply its provisions from the date of Your Excellency's reply. If either of our two Governments wishes to amend or terminate this agreement the two Governments will consult in order to consider possible effects of such amendment or termination on contracts concluded under the agreement. Such consultation shall be without prejudice to obligations and liabilities which have then accrued pursuant to the terms of this agreement. Please accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. (sd.) H. FREEMAN MATTHEWS Enclosure: Copy of Model Contract.  *His Excellency J. W. Beyen,*   *Royal Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs,*   *The Hague.*

If no such claim is submitted within said period of two years plus any extensions, the Contracting Officer may determine the amount due and the amount so determined shall be paid to the Netherlands Government in full settlement of the termination; *provided* that the Contracting Officer shall first give the Netherlands Government written notice of the amount thus determined and the Netherlands Government shall have ninety (90) days from receipt of such notice within which to protest the amount of the determination.

The contract shall be amended accordingly, and the Netherlands Government shall be paid the agreed amount.   
(e).  In arriving at a determination of the amount of compensation to be paid to the Netherlands Government in the event of the omission of the Netherlands Government to file a termination claim within the required time he Contracting Officer may be guided to the extent applicable by the “Statement of Principles for Determination of Costs” set forth in Part 4 of Section VIII of the Armed Services Procurement Regulation as in effect on the date of this contract, or by any other sound principles of cost determination; it being understood by both Governments that although the Contracting Officer is not required to be guided by that “Statement of Principles”, in making such determination, he will ordinarily be so guided.   
(f).  In arriving at the amount due to the Netherlands Government under this clause there shall be deducted (1) all unliquidated payments on account theretofore made to the Netherlands Government, (2) any claim which the United States Government may have against the Netherlands Government in connection with this contract, and (3) the agreed price for, or the net proceeds of sale of, any materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Netherlands Government or sold, pursuant to the provisions of this clause, and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the United States Government (for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, such net proceeds will be exclusive of any identifiable taxes included therein from which the property has been exempted under the 7 March 1952 Tax Agreement).   
(g).  If the termination hereunder be partial, prior to the settlement of the terminated portion of this contract, the Netherlands Government may file with the Contracting Officer a request in writing for an equitable adjustment of the price or prices specified in the contract relating to the continued portion of the contract (the portion not terminated by the Notice of Termination) and such equitable adjustment as may be agreed upon shall be made in such price or prices.   
(h).  Upon notification to the United States Government by the Netherlands Government that the Netherlands Government is precluded from performing the contract in accordance with its terms due to circumstances beyond the control of the Netherlands Government, the two Governments will consult with a view toward negotiating an amendment to the contract, in the form of a reasonable extension of time for the performance of the contract (it being recognized, however, that there may be special cases where the United States need for the end product will not admit of postponement) or an amendment to the contract in some other respect. If the Netherlands Government should fail to perform the contract in accordance with its terms, and such failure should be due to causes within the control of the Netherlands Government, then the United States Government may terminate this contract by reason of the failure of the Netherlands Government to perform it. Any such termination shall be without cost to the United States Government, and without liability of either Government to the other; provided that the parties hereto may agree to the transfer to the United States Government of any of the property described in paragraph (b) (6) above, in which event the United States Government will pay to the Netherlands Government the price provided in the contract for completed items, and a price mutually agreed upon for other items.   
(i).  The Netherlands Government will make available to the United States Government without direct charge such books, records, documents, and other evidence bearing on the costs and expenses of the Netherlands Government under this contract and relating to the work terminated hereunder, as may be necessary to determine the facts, or, to the extent approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, micro-photographs, or other authentic reproductions thereof.

### No.  I  

AMERIKAANSE AMBASSADE No. 447 's-Gravenhage, 15 April 1954 Excellentie, Ik heb de eer te verwijzen naar de besprekingen welke hebben plaats gehad tussen vertegenwoordigers van onze beide Regeringen met betrekking tot een Memorandum van Overeenkomst betreffende het Offshore Procurement Programma van de Verenigde Staten in Nederland. Deze besprekingen hebben geleid tot overeenstemming ten aanzien van een Memorandum van Overeenkomst dat als volgt luidt: 
### *„Memorandum van Overeenkomst tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de Regering van Nederland betreffende Offshore Procurement* 

„Dit Memorandum geeft bepaalde beginselen en richtlijnen, welke, zoals de Nederlandse Regering en de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika zijn overeengekomen, zullen gelden ten aanzien van het Offshore Procurement Programma van de Verenigde Staten in Nederland. 

„1.  *Omvang en doel van het Offshore Procurement Programma*  „Het is de bedoeling van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten om binnen het offshore procurement programma in landen, welke deel nemen aan het Programma tot Wederzijdse Hulpverlening, een programma van militaire aanschaffingen uit te voeren van die soorten materialen, diensten, voorraden en uitrusting, welke geschikt zijn voor aanschaffing voor militaire doeleinden van de Verenigde Staten en welke nodig zijn hetzij voor het militaire hulpprogramma voor wederzijdse veiligheid of voor het rechtstreeks gebruik door de strijdkrachten van de Verenigde Staten. De omvang van dit programma in Nederland is afhankelijk van de mogelijkheid voor de Regering van de Verenigde Staten om opdrachten te plaatsen tegen redelijke prijzen en met bevredigende levertijden. Het is de bedoeling, dat de uitvoering van dit programma wezenlijk zal bijdragen tot het gezamenlijke productievermogen voor defensie-doeleinden van de naties, welke lid zijn van de NAVO en de EDG en tegelijkertijd de middelen zal verschaffen tot verhoging van de dollarverdiensten van deze landen. „De Regering van de Verenigde Staten zal het offshore procurement programma uitvoeren in overeenstemming met de wetten van de Verenigde Staten, welke de militaire aankopen regelen en met het Wederzijdse Veiligheids Programma. Het is tevens de bedoeling van de Verenigde Staten, dat het offshore procurement programma in Nederland zal worden uitgevoerd ter bevordering van de beginselen, uiteengezet in paragraaf 516 (A) van de “Mutual Security Act” van 1951, zoals gewijzigd, de “Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act” van 1951 en art. II (3) van de Overeenkomst tot Economische Samenwerking tussen de Nederlandse Regering en de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, ondertekend te 's-Gravenhage op 2 Juli 1948, zoals gewijzigd.  

„2.  *Intergouvernementele coördinatie*  „Het aankoopprogramma van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van militaire goederen in Nederland zal gecoördineerd worden met het defensieprogramma van de Nederlandse Regering, naarmate dit zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor in aanmerking komende ambtenaren van de beide Regeringen zullen geregeld overleg plegen teneinde productievraagstukken en het tot uitvoering brengen van aanbevelingen voor de aankoop van goederen, benodigd door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten, te bestuderen. Beide Regeringen zullen naar behoefte geregeld inlichtingen uitwisselen ten aanzien van aankoopplannen, productiefaciliteiten in Nederland en van de vooruitgang bij het bereiken van productie-doeleinden in Nederland. „Afschriften of uittreksels van contracten, afgesloten met Nederlandse particuliere contractanten, zullen door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten aan de Nederlandse Regering worden verstrekt.  

„3.  *De plaatsing van contracten door “Contracting Officers”*  „Het is wel verstaan, dat offshore procurement contracten namens de Regering van de Verenigde Staten geplaatst en geadministreerd zullen worden door zgn. “contracting officers” van de Militaire Departementen van de Verenigde Staten.  

„4.  *Partijen bij contracten*  „De “contracting officers” van de Verenigde Staten kunnen contracten afsluiten met de Nederlandse Regering of rechtstreeks met particulieren, vennootschappen of andere rechtspersonen. De Nederlandse Regering geeft er de voorkeur aan, dat de Regering van de Verenigde Staten rechtstreeks contracteert met particulieren, vennootschappen of andere rechtspersonen.  

„5.  *Contract bijstand*  „De Nederlandse Regering zal, op verzoek van de “contracting officer”, bijstand verlenen bij de keuze van contractanten, en technische inlichtingen betreffende mogelijke sub-contractanten en zal de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en individuele contractanten, voorzover noodzakelijk en dienstig, behulpzaam zijn bij het administreren en het uitvoeren van offshore procurement contracten.  

„6.  *Verschaffing van uitrusting, materialen en arbeidskrachten*  „De Nederlandse Regering zal aan offshore procurement contractanten en hun sub-contractanten voorrang verlenen voor het verkrijgen van uitrusting, materialen, arbeidskrachten en diensten, gelijk die welke verleend wordt aan contractanten, die soortgelijke contracten met de Nederlandse Regering hebben gesloten.  

„7.  *Beveiliging*  „Wanneer aankoopcontracten door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten bij de Nederlandse Regering worden geplaatst, zal al het gerubriceerd materiaal, met inbegrip van inlichtingen, door de ene Regering aan de andere Regering verstrekt, door de ontvangende Regering een rubricering worden gegeven, die aan de stukken in wezen de zelfde graad van beveiliging verschaft als die, verleend door de Regering die de stukken verstrekt; zij zullen door de ontvangende Regering worden behandeld zoals haar eigen gerubriceerde stukken van de zelfde rubriceringsgraad. De ontvangende Regering zal van zodanig materiaal geen gebruik maken, of toestemming tot gebruik geven, voor andere dan militaire doeleinden en zij zal dergelijk materiaal niet openbaar maken, of toestemming tot openbaarmaking geven aan een ander land zonder de toestemming van de Regering waarvan het materiaal afkomstig is. „In geval van contracten gesloten tussen de Regeringen, die het mededelen van zeer geheime inlichtingen met zich brengen, zal de Nederlandse Regering, indien de “contracting officer” daarom verzoekt, de Regering van de Verenigde Staten behulpzaam zijn bij het handhaven van verboden zones overeenkomstig de Nederlandse wet op verboden plaatsen (Wet Bescherming Staatsgeheimen). „Wanneer aankoopcontracten door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten worden geplaatst bij particulieren, vennootschappen of andere rechtspersonen, zullen veiligheidsmaatregelen voor gerubriceerd materiaal worden getroffen, gelijk aan die, omschreven in het vorige lid. Voorafgaand aan de plaatsing van het contract zal de “contracting officer” de toekomstige producent en de Nederlandse Regering in kennis stellen van de veiligheidsrubricering van het contract. Gerubriceerd materiaal van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten, benodigd door een Nederlandse contractant, zal aan het daarvoor in aanmerking komende Ministerie van de Nederlandse Regering worden afgeleverd ter doorzending aan de contractant. Zodanig materiaal zal, voorafgaand aan de doorzending, van de Nederlandse Regering een veiligheidsrubricering ontvangen, die aan de stukken in wezen de zelfde graad van veiligheid zal verschaffen als die, toegekend door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en op het tijdstip van doorzending zal de Nederlandse Regering de contractant ervan in kennis stellen, dat het gerubriceerde materiaal, dat aan haar is geleverd, ook gerubriceerd materiaal van de Nederlandse Regering is en onderworpen is aan de bepalingen van de Wet Bescherming Staatsgeheimen. De Nederlandse Regering verplicht zich tot het doen nakomen van de veiligheidseisen en verplichtingen welke aan de particuliere Nederlandse contractanten in het bezit van dergelijk gerubriceerd materiaal worden opgelegd. „Teneinde een voldoende bescherming van gerubriceerde inlichtingen en materiaal te verzekeren, zal het daarvoor in aanmerking komende Ministerie van de Nederlandse Regering, desgevraagd een veiligheidsonderzoek instellen ten aanzien van elke toekomstige Nederlandse contractant met de Regering van de Verenigde Staten, op een zelfde wijze als dergelijke onderzoeken geschieden in gevallen van defensie-aankopen door de Nederlandse Regering; aan de Regering van de Verenigde Staten zal een uit een dergelijk onderzoek voortvloeiende aanbeveling worden gedaan. „Er zullen door de Nederlandse Regering geen kosten worden berekend voor diensten, verricht door haar veiligheidsdiensten.  

„8.  *Keuring*  „Een keuring van alle materialen, voorraden, uitrusting en diensten, door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten in Nederland aangekocht of verworven, hetzij van de Nederlandse Regering, hetzij van Nederlandse producenten en leveranciers, zal worden uitgevoerd door vertegenwoordigers van de Nederlandse Regering indien de Regering van de Verenigde Staten daarom verzoekt. In dergelijke gevallen zal de Nederlandse Regering tegenover de Regering van de Verenigde Staten verklaren, dat de producten voldoen aan alle specificaties en andere technische eisen van het contract. In de regel zal de keuring niet worden gedupliceerd. Voor verificatie-doeleinden zal de vertegenwoordiger van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten het recht hebben, tegenwoordig te zijn bij alle door controleurs van de Nederlandse Regering uitgevoerde keuringen en de keuringsverslagen van de Nederlandse Regering na te gaan. De vertegenwoordigers van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten zullen het recht hebben, onafhankelijke keuringen en verificaties uit te voeren en, voorzover mogelijk, zullen dergelijke keuringen plaats vinden gezamenlijk met Nederlandse controleurs. In de regel zullen door de Nederlandse Regering geen kosten voor keuringsdiensten worden berekend, in het bijzonder ten aanzien van goederen, vervaardigd voor levering aan landen, die lid zijn van de NAVO of de EDG. In geen geval zullen kosten berekend worden voor keuringsdiensten in verband met goederen, aangekocht door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten voor levering aan de Nederlandse Regering. Mocht de Nederlandse Regering het nodig achten, kosten in rekening te brengen voor keuringsdiensten in verband met materialen, voorraden, uitrustingen of diensten, aangekocht of verworven onder een contract tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de Nederlandse Regering, dan zullen dergelijke keuringskosten worden begrepen in de voorgestelde contractprijs, die aan de Regering van de Verenigde Staten wordt geoffreerd. Mocht de Nederlandse Regering het nodig achten, kosten te berekenen voor keuringsdiensten in verband met aankopen door de Verenigde Staten rechtstreeks geplaatst bij particuliere contractanten in Nederland, dan zullen de onderscheidene Regeringen een contract sluiten teneinde dergelijke kosten te dekken. In geen geval zullen de keuringskosten de werkelijke daarvoor door de Nederlandse Regering gemaakte kosten te boven gaan.  

„9.  *Credietvoorzieningen*  „Het is wel verstaan, dat de Nederlandse Regering Nederlandse contractanten, die produceren voor het offshore procurement programma van de Verenigde Staten, behulpzaam zal zijn bij het verschaffen van een behandeling betreffende handelsbankprioriteiten gelijk aan die, welke worden verleend aan Nederlandse ondernemingen die voor de Nederlandse defensie en voor de export werken.  

,,10.  *Vergunningen*  „De Nederlandse Regering zal het verlenen en verkrijgen vergemakkelijken van alle noodzakelijke vergunningen met inbegrip van deviezen-, uitvoer- en invoervergunningen, vereist in verband met enig offshore procurement contract, in Nederland geplaatst. „De Nederlandse Regering zal ook het verkrijgen en verlenen van dergelijke vergunningen vergemakkelijken in verband met offshore procurement contracten door de Regering van de Verenigde Staten in andere NAVO of EDG landen geplaatst, tenzij een dergelijk ander land na een desbetreffend verzoek in gebreke blijft, wederkerige behandeling te verlenen met betrekking tot vergunningen, die nodig mochten zijn in verband met in Nederland geplaatste offshore procurement contracten.  

„11.  *Belastingen*  „De bepalingen van de Overeenkomst tussen de Nederlandse Regering en de Regering van de Verenigde Staten, gedagtekend 7 Maart 1952, zijn van toepassing op dit programma, evenals de overeengekomen procedures die krachtens die Overeenkomst door vertegenwoordigers van de beide Regeringen zijn uitgewerkt. De beide Regeringen kunnen van tijd tot tijd naargelang de noodzaak daartoe zich voordoet, overleg plegen ten aanzien van verdere uitvoering van die Overeenkomst.  

„12.  *Standaard contractclausules*  „De beide Regeringen hebben standaard clausules goedgekeurd voor gebruik in tussen hen gesloten contracten, waar zulks dienstig is. Andere clausules kunnen in individuele contracten worden opgenomen, met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot, clausules voor glijdende prijzen, vooruitbetaling en betaling in termijnen, waar toepasselijk.  

„13.  *Bescherming van eigendom en personeel van de Verenigde Staten*  „Overeenkomstig de bestaande wetten en gewoonten in Nederland zullen alle belangen van de Regering van de Verenigde Staten bij eigendom, geleverd of verkregen door middel van offshore procurement contracten in Nederland, vrij zijn van wettelijke aansprakelijkheid of rechtsvordering. Op de zelfde wijze wordt de Regering van de Verenigde Staten beschermd tegen rechtsgedingen of andere vormen van wettelijke aansprakelijkheid in Nederland betreffende enige aangelegenheid die uit een offshore procurement contract zal kunnen ontstaan. “Contracting officers” en ander gemachtigd aankooppersoneel, in Nederland verblijvend in verband met het offshore procurement programma en wier namen naar behoren aan de Nederlandse Regering zijn medegedeeld, zullen de voorrechten en immuniteiten verleend worden, die zijn uiteengezet in de leden (b) en (c) van Bijlage E van het Verdrag tot Wederzijdse Hulpverlening inzake Verdediging tussen de Verenigde Staten en Nederland, ondertekend te Washington op 27 Januari 1950, met dien verstande dat bij het in werking treden tussen de Verenigde Staten en Nederland van de NAVO Overeenkomst betreffende de Rechtspositie van de Strijdkrachten, de rechtspositie van deze “contracting officers” en ander bevoegd aankooppersoneel zal worden herzien in het licht van die overeenkomst, van andere bestaande overeenkomsten welke tussen de Regeringen van kracht mochten zijn en van andere passende overwegingen.  

,,14.  *Bestemming der goederen*  „Het vaststellen van specificaties en andere eisen van bepaalde offshore procurement contracten kan de voorlopige aanduiding vereisen van het land dat de te vervaardigen goederen zal ontvangen. Het is niettemin wel verstaan dat, tenzij in een bijzonder geval tussen de twee Regeringen uitdrukkelijk anders is overeengekomen, de Verenigde Staten een dergelijke eerdere vaststelling en aanduiding van het land dat de te vervaardigen goederen uiteindelijk zal ontvangen, later kunnen wijzigen.  

„15.  *Contractbepalingen*  „Voorzover de wetten van de Verenigde Staten het gebruik van een contract verbieden, waarbij betaling is gebaseerd op de kostprijs plus een percentage van die kostprijs, wordt overeengekomen, dat een dergelijk systeem van betalingsvaststelling niet toegepast zal worden in contracten, die tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en hetzij particuliere contractanten, hetzij de Nederlandse Regering zullen worden gesloten. Bovendien verklaart de Nederlandse Regering, dat zij geen gebruik zal maken van het soort contracten, waarin betaling wordt vastgesteld op basis van kostprijs plus een percentage van de kostprijs, in sub-contracten krachtens enig contract tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de Nederlandse Regering gesloten. „Ter informatie van de aankoop-officier van de Verenigde Staten verklaart de Nederlandse Regering, dat er in Nederland geen wet bestaat die inhouding van overwinst toestaat, gelijk aan de “Renegotiation Act” van de Verenigde Staten. De beide Regeringen kunnen in contracten tussen hen gesloten overeenkomen, dat bepalingen worden opgenomen, die de omvang van winst van subcontractanten beperken. In dergelijke gevallen zal de Nederlandse Regering alle winsten, terugbetaald door dergelijke sub-contractanten, aan de Regering van de Verenigde Statten overdragen. Procedures voor de vaststelling en het terugvorderen van winsten zullen door de twee Regeringen worden overeengekomen.  

„16.  *Kennisgeving van sub-contracten*  „Ten aanzien van contracten, aangegaan tussen de Regeringen van Nederland en de Verenigde Staten, zal de Nederlandse Regering aan de “contracting officers” van de Verenigde Staten die inlichtingen verschaffen, waarom mocht worden verzocht, betreffende de plaatsing van sub-contracten en aankooporders door de Nederlandse Regering onder zulke tussen de Regeringen gesloten contracten.  

„17.  *Winstuitsluitingsclausule*  „Het is de bedoeling, dat op offshore procurement contracten, aangegaan tussen de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en de Nederlandse Regering, door de Nederlandse Regering geen winst van welke aard - daaronder begrepen winsten voortvloeiende uit wisselkoersschommelingen - zal worden gemaakt. De Nederlandse Regering stemt erin toe, vóór 31 December 1954 of eventueel op een latere tussen de twee Regeringen overeen te komen datum, vast te stellen of zij dergelijke winst heeft gemaakt, in welk geval, of in geval de Regering van de Verenigde Staten vóór die datum van oordeel is dat dergelijke winst kan zijn gemaakt, de Nederlandse Regering erin toestemt, met de Regering van de Verenigde Staten besprekingen te openen teneinde het bestaan en het bedrag van een dergelijke winst vast te stellen. Tijdens die besprekingen zal de Regering van de Verenigde Staten inzage mogen nemen van die documenten en boekhoudingsgegevens, welke nodig mochten blijken om de feiten vast te stellen. Voor de berekening van de winsten waarvan hier sprake is, zullen de contracten als één geheel worden genomen en zal rekening worden gehouden met de stijging van kosten, die voor de Nederlandse Regering mochten zijn voortgevloeid uit de contracten tengevolge van een schommeling van wisselkoersen. Indien als resultaat van de besprekingen tussen beide Regeringen wordt vastgesteld, dat door de Nederlandse Regering op de gezamenlijke contracten een netto-winst is gemaakt, zal zij het bedrag van die winst aan de Regering van de Verenigde Staten terugbetalen overeenkomstig voorzieningen en procedures, die tussen de twee Regeringen zullen worden overeengekomen. „Dit artikel zal niet zo worden uitgelegd, dat het op enige wijze die winstterugbetalingsbepalingen, die in individuele contracten zijn vervat, aantast.”   Tevens werd overeenstemming bereikt ten aanzien van de standaard clausules bedoeld in artikel 12 van het Memorandum van Overeenkomst, welke zijn opgenomen in een model-contract. Een specimen van dit contract is bij deze Nota gevoegd als Bijlage No. 1. Deze Nota en Uwer Excellentie's bevestigend antwoord zullen ten aanzien van deze aangelegenheid een overeenkomst vormen welke in werking zal treden op de datum waarop aan de Amerikaanse Ambassade wordt medegedeeld, dat de in Nederland grondwettelijk vereiste goedkeuring is verkregen. Inmiddels stel ik voor dat de partijen bij deze Overeenkomst haar bepalingen zullen toepassen met ingang van de datum van Uwer Excellentie's antwoord. Indien een van onze Regeringen deze Overeenkomst mocht wensen te wijzigen of te beëindigen, zullen de beide Regeringen overleg plegen teneinde de gevolgen onder ogen te zien welke een dergelijke wijziging of beëindiging zou kunnen hebben voor krachtens deze Overeenkomst afgesloten contracten. Een dergelijk overleg zal plaats vinden onverminderd de verplichtingen en aansprakelijkheden welke op dat ogenblik krachtens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst mochten zijn ontstaan.
