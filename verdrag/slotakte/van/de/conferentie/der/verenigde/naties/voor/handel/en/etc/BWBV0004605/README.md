####FINAL ACT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT

*PREAMBLE*  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has adopted this Final Act.    

### SECTION  I  

####BACKGROUND

1. The States participating in the Conference are determined to achieve the high purposes embodied in the United Nations Charter “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”; to seek a better and more effective system of international economic co-operation, whereby the division of the world into areas of poverty and plenty may be banished and prosperity achieved by all; and to find ways by which the human and material resources of the world may be harnessed for the abolition of poverty everywhere. In an age when scientific progress has put unprecedented abundance within man's reach, is is essential that the flows of world trade should help to eliminate the wide economic disparities among nations. The international community must combine its efforts to ensure that all countries - regardless of size, of wealth, of economic and social system - enjoy the benefits of international trade for their economic development and social progress. <sup> 1)  Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.  </sup>  

2. Recognizing that universal peace and prosperity are closely linked and that the economic growth of the developing countries will also contribute to the economic growth of the developed countries, realizing the danger of a widening gulf in living standards between peoples, and convinced of the benefits of international co-operation with a view to helping the developing countries to reach a higher standard of life, the States signatories of this Final Act are resolved, in a sense of human solidarity, “to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples” . <sup> 1)  Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.  </sup>  

3. In endorsing the decision to convene the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the General Assembly of the United Nations was motivated by certain basic considerations. Economic and social progress throughout the world depends in large measure on a steady expansion in international trade. The extensive development of equitable and mutually advantageous international trade creates a good basis for the establishment of neighbourly relations between States, helps to strengthen peace and an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding among nations, and promotes higher living standards and more rapid economic progress in all countries of the world. Finally, the accelerated economic development of the developing countries depends largely on a substantial increase in their share in international trade.  

4. The task of development, which implies a complex of structural changes in the economic and social environment in which men live, is for the benefit of the people as a whole. The developing countries are already engaged in a determined attempt to achieve, by their own efforts, a breakthrough into self-sustaining economic growth which furthers social progress. These efforts must continue and be enlarged. Economic and social progress should go together. If privilege, extremes of wealth and poverty, and social injustice persist, then the goal of development is lost. If the social and cultural dimension of development is ignored, economic advance alone can bring no abiding benefit.  

5. The developing countries recognize that they have the primary responsibility to raise the living standards of their peoples; but their national exertions to this end will be greatly impaired if not supplemented and strengthened by constructive international action based on respect for national sovereignty. An essential element of such action is that international policies in the field of trade and development should result in a modified international division of labour which is more rational and equitable and is accompanied by the necessary adjustments in world production and trade. The resultant increase in productivity and purchasing power of the developing countries will contribute to the economic growth of the industrialized countries as well, and thus become a means to world-wide prosperity.  

6. The issues before the Conference have been at once challenging and urgent. While there are varying degrees of development, the joint income of the developing countries, with two-thirds of the world's population, is not much more than one-tenth of that of the industrialized countries. Moreover, the dramatic increase in the population of the developing countries multiplies the difficulties they face in assuring to their peoples even the simplest elements of a decent human life. The aim must be to create jointly new trade and new wealth, so as to share a common prosperity, and thereby avoid the waste and other unfavourable consequences of closed paths to development. The international community is called upon to join in a constructive and universal policy of co-operation for trade and development which will further economic progress throughout the world.  

7. The designation of the nineteen-sixties as the United Nations Development Decade was a recognition of deep world-wide concern with the urgent necessity of raising the standard of living of the developing countries and an earnest of the resolve of the United Nations, working together, to accomplish this task. Wide concern has been expressed regarding the inadequacy of the Decade's objective of a minimum rate of growth of aggregate national income of 5 per cent per annum by 1970. To attain even this rate of growth it is essential that measures and action be taken by both the developing and the developed countries, including measures to raise the level and accelerate the rate of growth of earnings of the developing countries from trade, as a means of helping them to overcome their persistent external imbalance.  

8. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was convened in order to provide, by means of international cooperation, appropriate solutions to the problems of world trade in the interest of all peoples and particularly to the urgent trade and development problems of the developing countries. In a period when their need for imports of development goods and for technical knowledge has been increasing, developing countries have been faced with a situation in which their export earnings and capacity to import goods and services have been inadequate. The growth in import requirements has not been matched by a commensurate expansion in export earnings. The resultant trade gap, which gold and foreign exchange reserves have been inadequate to bridge, has had to be filled very largely by capital imports. This in itself cannot provide a complete or permanent solution, and indeed the servicing of external debts and the outgoings on other “invisible” items themselves present severe burdens for developing countries. Moreover, the terms of trade have operated to the disadvantage of the developing countries. In recent years many developing countries have been faced with declining prices for their exports of primary commodities at a time when prices of their imports of manufactured goods, particularly capital equipment, have increased. This, together with the heavy dependence of individual developing countries on primary commodity exports has reduced their capacity to import. Unless these and other unfavourable trends are changed in the near future, the efforts of the developing countries to develop, diversify and industrialize their economies will be seriously hampered.  

9. Deeply sensible of the urgency of the problems with which the Conference has dealt, the States participating in this Conference, taking note of the recommendations of the Conference, are determined to do their utmost to lay the foundations of a better world economic order.    

### SECTION  II  

####CONSTITUTION AND PROCEEDINGS

10. When, in the third week of December 1961, the General Assembly of the United Nations designated the current decade as “the United Nations Development Decade”, it also asked the Secretary-General to consult members on the advisability of convening an international conference on international trade problems. Both resolutions (1707 (XVI) and 1710 (XVI)) sprang from the growing conviction that the economic aims of the Charter would best be furthered by a bold new programme of international economic cooperation; and it was in this conviction that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development had its origin.  

11. The Cairo Conference on the Problems of Economic Development held in July 1962 issued a Declaration (which was later welcomed by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 1820 XVII)) strongly recommending the early convening of an international conference on trade and development. The idea of such a Conference having gained ground, the General Assembly of the United Nations endorsed, on 8 December 1962 (resolution 1785 (XVII)), the decision taken in August 1962 by the Economic and Social Council (resolution 917 (XXXIV)) whereby the Council resolved to convene this Conference and to establish a Preparatory Committee to consider its agenda. The Secretary-General was requested to invite all States Members of the United Nations and members of the specialized agencies and of the International Atomic Energy Agency to take part in the Conference. The deliberations of the Preparatory Committee's three sessions were fruitful: a detailed provisional agenda for the Conference was drawn up, and a report was prepared defining the problems to be examined and suggesting the directions in which possible solutions might be sought. At the Committee's request the secretariats of the United Nations family of organizations prepared many studies of the issues involved. The Secretary-General of the Conference sought the advice of governments and scholars, and prepared his report entitled *Towards a New Trade Policy for Development*. Member States, individually and in groups, also submitted useful proposals and suggestions to the Conference. <sup> 2)  The first session of the Preparatory Committee took place at United Nations Headquarters from 22 January to 5 February 1963; the second was held at the European Office of the United Nations, at Geneva, from 21 May to 29 June 1963; and the third session was at United Nations Headquarters from 3 to 15 February 1964. At its third session, the Committee decided that informal closed meetings should be held prior to the opening of the Conference. These pre-Conference meetings were held in Geneva from 18 to 23 March 1964.  </sup>  

12. On 18 July 1963, the Economic and Social Council decided that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should be held in Geneva, beginning on 23 March 1964 and continuing until 15 June 1964, and approved the provisional agenda drawn up by the Preparatory Committee (Economic and Social Council resolution 963 (XXXVI)). By its resolution of 11 November 1963 the General Assembly (resolution 1897 (XVIII)) noted the work of the Preparatory Committee and of the Secretary-General of the Conference, welcomed the Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries , and invited States to give serious consideration to it. The regional economic commissions and other regional organizations considered questions of trade and development and adopted important resolutions and declarations . Meanwhile, as the practical arrangements for the Conference went forward, the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council were the principal forum for debates expressing the high hopes vested by the peoples of the United Nations in the Conference as a potential turning point in international co-operation in the field of trade and development. <sup> 3)  The Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries was adopted at the same time as, and forms an annex to, the General Assembly resolution in question.  </sup> <sup> 4)  See the reports relating to the Brasilia meeting convened by the Economic Commission for Latin America (E/CONF.46/60 and 71) and the Alta Gracia Charter approved by the Special Latin American Co-ordinating Committee of the Organization of American States, (E/CONF.46/100) the resolutions adopted by the Economic Commission for Africa (E/CONF .46/82) and by the Economic and Social Commission of African Unity at Niamey (E/CONF.46/107), the resolution of the Economic Commission for Europe (E/CONF.46/46) and the Teheran resolutions of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (E/CONF.46/87).  </sup>  

13. Aware of these high hopes, the representatives of the following one hundred and twenty States gathered in Geneva from 23 March to 16 June 1964 to take part in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development: <sup> 5)  Somalia and Western Samoa were invited, but did not attend the Conference.  </sup> Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Burundi, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Ceylon, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Leopoldville), Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Gabon, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Holy See, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of Viet-Nam, Romania, Rwanda, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanganyika 6), Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Arab Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zanzibar . <sup> 6)  On 27 May 1964, as a result of the formation of the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the delegations of Tanganyika and Zanzibar were reconstituted as a unified delegation.  </sup>  

14. The inaugural address was delivered by the President of Switzerland; the Secretary-General of the United Nations also addressed the Conference; and messages of goodwill and good wishes for success were received from numerous Heads of State. After adopting its agenda and electing its officers - a President, twenty-seven Vice-Presidents, and a Rapporteur - the Conference was addressed by its President and heard, over a period of twelve days, an address by its Secretary-General and a series of policy statements by heads of delegations, most of whom were Cabinet ministers, and by representatives of a number of inter-governmental economic organizations. Five Committees of the whole were established for detailed study of the items of the agenda. The General Committee of the Conference comprised the President, the Vice-Presidents, the Rapporteur, and the Chairman of the five Committees. The Conference also established a Drafting Committee for the Final Act.  

15. With a view to reaching agreement on the issues before the Conference, many informal meetings were held and important consultations conducted among groups of delegations. A notable feature of the Conference was the fact that the delegations of the States signatories of the Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries co-ordinated their work with a view to enhancing general co-operation among all delegations.    

### SECTION  III  

####FINDINGS

The Conference has been guided by the following findings: 

16. World trade has expanded substantially in recent years: the value of world exports has more than doubled since 1950. The principal impulse for this growth has been provided by the overall expansion of the world economy, aided by national and international action as well as enormous scientific and technical progress and the social and economic changes in the world.  

17. The countries of the world did not share proportionately in this expansion of international trade. While exports of developing countries rose from $ 19.2 billion to $ 28.9 billion between 1950 and 1962, that is by 50 per cent, the expansion of exports from these countries proceeded at an appreciably lower rate than that of developed countries. As a result, the share of developing countries in world exports declined steadily from nearly one-third in 1950 to only slightly more than one-fifth in 1962. Concurrently, the developed market economies increased their share from three-fifths to two-thirds, and the centrally planned economies from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. One of the reasons for the decline in the rate of expansion of world exports from 8.4 per cent per annum in the early fifties to rather less than 5 per cent in the early sixties is the inability of the developing countries to attain a higher rate of export expansion.  

18. The difficulties experienced by developing countries in increasing the sale of their products at remunerative prices in the markets of most of the highly industrialized countries have placed a limit on the extent to which they can purchase capital goods and machinery from the developed countries, which in turn has contributed to a slower rate of expansion of world trade than would have been the case if the developing countries had been enabled to increase their exports at a faster rate. Further, measures having discriminatory or protectionist effects applied by certain developed countries have hampered the development of the trade of developing countries and of world trade in general.  

19. The difficulties of developing countries were aggravated by deterioration in their terms of trade during the period 1950-1962. The slower growth in the quantity of exports of the developing countries and the adverse movement of their terms of trade were largely the reflexion of the present commodity composition of their trade, consisting, as is does, predominantly of the exchange of primary product exports for manufactured imports whose relative positions in world markets have undergone significant changes. World trade in manufactures has been increasing at an annual rate more than twice that of trade in primary products. Factors contributing to the sluggishness of primary product exports include the low response of consumer demand for food to increases in income of consumers in the advanced countries where incomes and food consumption are already high, the widespread use of substitutes and synthetics, and the increasing output of primary products in advanced countries which has been the result both of domestic policies, in many cases reinforced by protective barriers, as well as a general increase in productivity stemming from technological progress. These long-term trends have been accentuated by short-term fluctuations in export earnings caused by economic recessions and other factors.  

20. The deterioration in terms of trade and the sluggish expansion of the export quantum of developing countries occurred at a time when their need for imported supplies to speed up the pace of their economic development sharply increased. There is a close link between the rate of economic growth and the available supply of investment goods. The developing countries require a specific increase in the supply of investment goods in order to achieve the Development Decade target. Since their domestic capacity to produce these goods is limited, a substantial amount of such goods has to be imported. Imports have to be financed through export receipts and inflows of capital from abroad. Thus, the resources required for a higher rate of growth would obviously have to be sougth in additional export earnings and an increase in the net inflow of long-term public and private funds.  

21. The developing countries' surplus of exports over imports in 1950 became a deficit in 1962 of $ 2.3 billion, while their net payments for investment income and other invisibles were about $ 3.3 billion around 1960. This deficit was covered by the provision of aid and other capital flows. However, the gap between the import requirements of developing countries and their export earnings has been widening According to United Nations Secretariat estimates, this gap could be of the order of $ 20 billion a year in 1970, on the basis of a 5 per cent per annum rate of growth set as the target for the United Nations Development Decade, assuming no change in the trends of the fifties upon which these estimates were based.  

22. In recent years, the developing countries have been turning increasingly to economic and social planning as the most effective means for accelerating their growth. Their plans, policies and institutions are designed to achieve the transformation of their economic and social structures and to provide for maximum saving, investment and output to a pre-determined order of priorities for a targeted rate of growth. However realistic the plans drawn up by the developing countries may be, their realization is hindered by the instability of international markets for primary products and by conditions restricting the access of primary commodities and semi-manufactures and manufactures to the markets of the developed countries. The continued dependence on the export of a single product or a few commodities whose prices have been declining in the past has made the realization of the development plans all the more difficult. The realization of economic and social development plans of the developing countries necessitates an appropriate change in the present structure of international trade in such a way as to afford them the opportunity of earning adequate and stable supplies of foreign exchange.  

23. An overwhelming proportion - over two-thirds - of the import and export trade of developing countries is with the developed market economies. Between 1950 and 1962 the total exports of the developed market economies to the developing countries increased by 98 per cent, rising from $ 10,650 million to $ 21,060 million. This contrasted with the exports of the developing countries to the developing market countries, which increased by 56 per cent, rising from $ 13,220 million to $ 20,660 million.  

24. The reason for the failure of export of the developing countries to the developed market economies to expand at a faster rate can be attributed to a number of factors. Reference has already been made in the foregoing passages to contributory factors of a general character. Specific policies include price-support programmes, customs duties and internal taxes and fiscal charges imposed on the consumption of tropical products, export subsidies on commodities of Interest to developing countries, and higher levels of tariffs imposed on processed products relative to those applied to such products when exported in their natural form. These factors have contributed to the sluggishness of the demand for the products of developing countries and in the case of some commodities to the accumulation of surpluses which have tended to exercise a depressing effect on world commodity prices. There is need for the elimination of these obstacles by national and international action designed to improve access and expand market opportunities for the exports of primary products, semi-manufactures and manufactures of developing countries in order to increase their export earnings.  

25. Owing to its relatively recent origin, trade between developing countries and the centrally planned economies is so far limited to a relatively small number of countries and constitutes a small part of the trade turnover of developing countries as a whole. In 1962, $ 1,630 million, or 5.6 per cent of the total exports of the developing countries went to the centrally planned economies, while imports from the latter into the former totalled $ 2,150 million and formed 7.3 per cent of total imports. This trade has, however, shown a tendency to increase rapidly in recent years. Thus, in terms of value, the exports of the countries with centrally planned economies to developing countries increased from $ 405 million to $ 2,150 million, or by 430 per cent, between 1950 and 1962, while exports from the developing countries to the countries with centrally planned economies showed an expansion from $ 610 million to $ 1,630 million, or by 167 per cent, over the same period.  

26. The expansion in trade has been secured mainly through medium and long-term bilateral trade agreements which stipulate the quantity and/or the value of goods to be exchanged. In spite of the rapidity of growth in trade between the two groups of countries, there is still considerable scope for expansion, which can be secured through the removal of certain obstacles which prevent a faster rate of growth and by further positive measures taken by the interested countries. The major obstacles arise from the fact that trade relations have not yet been established between many developing countries and centrally planned economies, the need, in some cases, due to the bilateral trade system, for individual developing countries to balance their trade with individual centrally planned economies and the paucity of knowledge among public and private organizations of trade partners in some developing countries about the products and the trade policies and practices of the centrally planned economies.  

27. These problems can be solved and trade between countries of the two groups expanded at a more rapid rate through the establishment of normal trade relations between centrally planned economies and a larger number of developing countries; through the granting by countries with centrally planned economies to developing countries, within the framework of the former's foreign trade system, of special advantages conducive to the promotion of such trade; through the adoption by the centrally planned economies, within the framework of their long-term plans, of appropriate measures to secure the diversification and a proportionately increasing growth of their imports of primary, semi-manufactured and manufactured products from developed countries; and through increased utilization by centrally planned economies, in addition to bilateral arrangements, of multilateral trade and payment methods, when these are considered to be of mutual advantage to all partners in the trade. Developing countries for their part should accord the countries with centrally planned economies conditions for trade not inferior to those granted normally to the developed market economy countries.  

28. Trade between the centrally planned countries and the developed market economies has grown rapidly in recent years. The full potentiality of this trade, however, has not been realized because of administrative, economic and trade policy obstacles. Efforts to discover means to solve these problems and increase trade to the mutual benefit of all partners concerned and thus achieve levels of trade commensurate with the apparent possibilities, have shown increasing progress in recent years.  

29. Continuation of such efforts in whatever available forums, including within the framework of the future institutional arrangements recommended by the Conference, should result in progressively greater levels of trade between countries having different economic and social systems. It is recognized that such a development would be in the interest of world trade as a whole.  

30. While trade between developed countries in increasing and while the share of such exchanges in total world trade is also rising, the level of trade between developing countries is very low and its importance in world trade has been decreasing. The expansion of inter and intra-regional trade is important to developing countries insofar as it provides them with wider markets for their products and enables them to further diversify their trade and to save on scarce foreign exchange. Hence, the establishment of closer and broader trade ties between developing countries is necessary.    

### SECTION  IV  

####REASONS AND CONSIDERATIONS

In drawing up its recommendations, the Conference has been guided by the following essential reasons and considerations: 

(31) The development of equitable and mutually advantageous trade can promote higher standards of living, full employment and rapid economic progress in all countries of the world.  

(32) The fundamental problems of developing countries are well identified and what is now required is a universal readiness to act and generally to adopt practical measures aimed at increasing exports and exports earnings of developing countries and accelerating their economic development.  

(33) At the root of the foreign trade difficulties facing the developing countries and other countries highly dependent on a narrow range of primary commodities are the slow rate of growth of demand for their exports of primary commodities, accounting for 90 per cent of their exports, the increasing participation of developed countries in world trade in primary commodities, and the deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries from 1950 to 1962.  

(34) During the period of structural readjustments of their economies, the developing countries will remain heavily dependent on commodity exports to meet growing import needs involved in the process of industrialization and diversification.  

(35) Because of the outstanding importance of commodity trade for economic development, particularly of the developing countries and the special difficulties affecting trade in primary commodities, it is important and urgent that action be taken over a wide front and on dynamic and comprehensive lines so as to conduct a concerted attack on international commodity problems.  

(36) There is accordingly a need deliberate effort on the part of all industrialized countries to remedy the adverse tendencies in question.  

(37) This comprehensive action should include international commodity arrangements as one of the means of stimulating a dynamic and steady growth of the real export earnings of the developing countries so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic and social development and of securing overall stabilization in primary commodity markets. It is also necessary to accelerate the removal of existing obstacles and to forestall the creation of new obstacles to commodity trade.  

(38) Compensatory financing is an appropriate solution to meet the serious residual problems caused by short-term fluctuations in the prices of and earnings from primary commodity exports. For residual long-term problems financial solutions should be sought.  

(39) The developing countries should not rely merely on the expansion of traditional exports of primary products and raw materials. Promotion of industries with an export potential in developing countries is essential. Diversification and expansion of exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods are among the important means to assist the developing countries to achieve in time a balance in their external accounts.  

(40) The establishment and expansion in developing countries of industries with an export potential call for a whole series of interrelated measures and action on the part of the developing countries within the framework of overall planning, as well as by developed countries and appropriate international organizations.  

(41) The role of the public sector in the economic development of developing countries is recognized, as well as the role of private capital, domestic and foreign.  

(42) Developing countries face obstacles and difficulties in marketing their manufactures and semi-manufactures in the developed countries. In order to facilitate the industrial exports of developing countries, their products should have freer access particularly to the markets of the developed countries, but also to the markets of other developing countries.  

(43) Easier access to markets should be provided not only for existing and traditional exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures, but also for a wider range of products in order to improve the opportunities for the establishment in the developing countries of a wider range of industries more technically evolved and producing industrial goods of higher degrees of complexity.  

(44) Substantial imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures may involve some re-adjustment in the industrial structures of the developed countries.  

(45) A lowering of trade barriers would improve the competitive position of the developing countries relative to that of domestic producers in the market of each developed country, but it would not improve their competitive position in that market in relation to exports from other developed countries. Special measures in favour of exports from developing countries would be needed to bring about the required expansion of such exports.  

(46) In addition to the expansion of exports of manufactures to developed countries, the expansion of such trade among the developing countries themselves would contribute towards solving the dilemma posed by the economic and technological requirements of modern industry on the one hand and the limited domestic markets of individual countries on the other. Because of the many forms which economic co-operation might have in various cases and the problems which they might cause, it is considered that a certain flexibility is needed.  

(47) The Conference has considered the general targets on which the international community might focus in dealing with the problems of development through trade and international co-operation. A number of principles and criteria aimed at providing constructive guide-lines for policies in the various areas of international financial and technical co-operation have been formulated. The major questions identified are as follows: 

(a) The need for higher growth rates for developing countries; measures to be taken by developed and developing countries, including measures to increase foreign exchange availabilities.  

(b) Guide-lines for international financial and technical co-operation; terms and conditions of aid, and the relation of trade and aid to maintain the continuity of sound development plans or programmes.  

(c) External debt problems.  

(d) The need and means for increasing the flow of financial resources to the developing countries.  

(e) Compensatory finance; supplementary financial measures.  

(f) Aspects of shipping and all other invisible items.  

(g) The need for periodic reviews.    

(48) There is wide recognition of the importance and gravity of the problem posed by the financing of development, in all its many complex aspects, and this recognition should form the basis for continuing reviews and action in this field.  

(49) There is also recognition of the need for greater and more systematic efforts by all parties involved, with a fair division of responsibilities among developed and developing countries, in order to engender the necessary co-operative efforts at the national, regional and international levels.  

(50) More specifically, there is wide agreement in some key areas which, though necessarily limited in scope, constituted forward steps. These areas include measures for accelerated growth in developing countries and increase in foreign exchange availabilities; guide-lines for international financial and technical co-operation, compensatory financing and supplementary financial measures, and for dealing with external debt problems; and some aspects of shipping in relation to the trade of developing countries.  

(51) Finally, in some other areas, there is also agreement that specific measures which have been proposed should be given further consideration or should be studied by the appropriate international organizations.  

52. In approaching the problem of institutional arrangements, the Conference has taken into account the fact that sustained efforts are necessary to raise the standards of living in all countries and to accelerate the economic growth of developing countries, and that international trade is an important instrument for economic development. The Conference has provided a unique opportunity to make a comprehensive review of the problems of trade and of trade in relation to economic development, particularly those problems affecting the developing countries. Is has recognized adequate and effectively functioning organizational arrangements are essential if the full contribution of international trade to the accelerated growth of the developing countries is to be successfully realized through the formulation and implementation of the necessary policies.  

53. To this end, the Conference has examined the operation of existing international institutions and has recognized both their contributions and theid limitations in dealing with all the problems of trade and related problems of development. It believes that participating governments should make the most effective use of institutions and arrangements to which they are or may become parties, and is convinced, at the same time, that there should be a further review of both the present and the proposed institutional arrangements, in the light of the experience of their work and activities. The Conference has further taken note of the widespread desire among developing countries for a comprehensive trade organization, and has recognized that further institutional arrangements are necessary in order to continue the work initiated by this Conference and to implement its recommendations and conclusions.    

####SECOND PART – A CONSOLIDATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CONFERENCE

<sup> 1)  The results of the voting on the Principles and Recommendations adopted by the Conference appear in Annex A. Observations and reservations appear in Annex B.  </sup>  

### SECTION  I  

####PRINCIPLES

1. The Conference has recommended the following General Principles to govern international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development: 
### *General Principle One* 

Economic relations between countries, including trade relations, shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality of states, self-determination of peoples, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. 
### *General Principle Two* 

There shall be no discrimination on the basis of differences in socio-economic systems. Adaptation of trading methods shall be consistent with this principle. 
### *General Principle Three* 

Every country has the sovereign right freely to trade with other countries, and freely to dispose of its natural resources in the interest of the economic development and well-being of its own people. 
### *General Principle Four* 

Economic development and social progress should be the common concern of the whole international community and should by increasing economic prosperity and well-being help strengthen peaceful relations and co-operation among nations. Accordingly, all countries pledge themselves to pursue internal and external economic policies designed to accelerate economic growth throughout the world, and in particular to help promote in developing countries a rate of growth consistent with the need to bring about substantial and steady increase in average income in order to narrow the gap between the standard of living in developing countries and that in the developed countries. 
### *General Principle Five* 

National and international economic policies should be directed towards the attainment of an international division of labour in harmony with the needs and interests of developing countries in particular and of the world as a whole. Developed countries should assist the developing countries in their efforts to speed up their economic and social progress, should co-operate in measures taken by developing countries for diversifying their economies and should encourage appropriate adjustments in their own economies to this end. 
### *General Principle Six* 

International trade is one of the most important factors in economic development. It should be governed by such rules as are consistent with the attainment of economic and social progress and should not be hampered by measures incompatible therewith. All countries should co-operate in creating conditions of international trade conducive in particular to the achievement of a rapid increase in the export earnings of developing countries and in general to the promotion of an expansion and diversification of trade between all countries, whether at similar levels of development, at different levels of development, or having different economic and social systems. 
### *General Principle Seven* 

The expansion and diversification of international trade depend upon increasing access to markets, and upon remunerative prices for the exports of primary products. Developed countries shall progressively reduce and, in appropriate cases, eliminate barriers and other restrictions that hinder trade and consumption of products of particular interest to developing countries and take positive measures such as will create and increase markets for the exports of developing countries. All countries should co-operate through suitable international arrangements on an orderly basis in implementing measures designed to increase and stabilize primary commodity export earnings, particularly of developing countries, at equitable and remunerative prices and to maintain a mutually acceptable relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and those of primary products. 
### *General Principle Eight* 

International trade should be conducted to mutual advantage on the basis of the most favoured nation treatment and should be free from measures detrimental to the trading interests of other countries. However, developed countries should grant concessions to all developing countries and extend to developing countries all concessions they grant to one another and should not in granting these or other concessions, require any concessions in return from developing countries. New preferential concessions, both tariff and non-tariff, should be made to developing countries as a whole and such preferences should not be extended to developed countries. Developing countries need to extend to developed countries preferential treatment in operation amongst them. Special preferences at present enjoyed by certain developing countries in certain developed countries should be regarded as transitional and subject to progressive reduction. They should be eliminated as and when effective international measures guaranteeing at least equivalent advantages to the countries concerned come into operation. 
### *General Principle Nine* 

Developed countries participating in regional economic groupings should do their utmost to ensure that their economic integration does not cause injury to, or otherwise adversely affect, the expansion of their imports from third countries, and in particular from developing countries, either individually or collectively. 
### *General Principle Ten* 

Regional economic groupings, integration or other forms of economic co-operation should be promoted among developing countries as a means of expanding their intra-regional and extra-regional trade and encouraging their economic growth and their industrial and agricultural diversification with due regard to the special features of development of the various countries concerned as well as their economic and social systems. It will be necessary to ensure that such co-operation makes an effective contribution to the economic development of these countries, and does not inhibit the economic development of other developing countries outside such groupings. 
### *General Principle Eleven* 

International institutions and developed countries should provide an increasing net flow of international financial, technical and economic assistance to support and reinforce, by supplementing the export earnings of developing countries, the efforts made by them to accelerate their economic growth through diversification, industrialization and increase of productivity on the basis of their national policies, plans and programmes of economic development. Such assistance should not be subject to any political or military conditions. This assistance, whatever its form and from whatever source, including foreign public and private loans and capital, should flow to developing countries on terms fully in keeping with their trade and development needs. International financial and monetary policies should be designed to take full account of the trade and development needs of developing countries. 
### *General Principle Twelve* 

All countries recognize that a significant portion of resources released in successive stages as a result of the conclusion of an agreement on general and complete disarmament under effective international control should be allocated to the promotion of economic development in developing countries. 
### *General Principle Thirteen* 

The Conference decided to include, as a separate part of the Principles adopted by the Conference, the Principles relating to transit trade of land-locked countries set forth below. 
### *General Principle Fourteen* 

Complete decolonization in compliance with the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the liquidation of the remnants of colonialism in all its forms is a necessary condition for economic development and the exercise of sovereign rights over natural resources. 
### *General Principle Fifteen* 

The adoption of international policies and measures for the economic development of the developing countries shall take into account the individual characteristics and different stages of development of the developing countries, special attention being paid to the less developed among them, as an effective means of ensuring sustained growth with equitable opportunity for each developing country.  

2. The Conference has recommended a number of Special Principles to govern international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development (see Annex A.I.1.).  

3. The Conference has adopted the following recommendation on Principles relating to transit trade of land-locked countries:  *The Conference,*  *Having regard* to the various aspects of the problem of transit trade of land-locked States, *Considering* that for the promotion of the economic development of the land-locked States, it is essential to provide facilities to enable them to overcome the effects of their land-locked position on their trade, *Adopts* the following principles together with the Interpretative Note: 
### *Principle I* 

The recognition of the right of each land-locked State of free access to the sea is an essential principle for the expansion of international trade and economic development. 
### *Principle II* 

In territorial and on internal waters, vessels flying the flag of landlocked countries should have identical rights and enjoy treatment identical to that enjoyed by vessels flying the flag of coastal States, other than the territorial State. 
### *Principle III* 

In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with coastal States, States having no sea coast should have free access to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State having no sea coast shall by common agreement with the latter and in conformity with existing international conventions accord to ships flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their own ships or to the ships of any other State as regards access to sea ports and the use of such ports. 
### *Principle IV* 

In order to promote fully the economic development of the landlocked countries, the said countries should be afforded by all States, on the basis of reciprocity, free and unrestricted transit, in such a manner that they have free access to regional and international trade in all circumstances and for every type of goods. Goods in transit should not be subject to any customs duty. Means of transport in transit should not be subject to special taxes or charges higher thans those levied for the use of means of transport of the transit country. 
### *Principle V* 

The State of transit, while maintaining full sovereignty over its territory shall have the right to take all indispensable measures to ensure that the exercise of the right of free and unrestricted transit shall in no way infringe its legitimate interests of any kind. 
### *Principle VI* 

In order to accelerate the evolution of a universal approach to the solution of the special and particular problems of trade and development of land-locked countries in the different geographical areas, the conclusion of regional and other international agreements in this regard should be encouraged by all States. 
### *Principle VII* 

The facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked countries in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause. 
### *Principle VIII* 

The principles which govern the right of free access to the sea of the land-locked State shall in no way abrogate existing agreements between two or more contracting parties concerning the problems, nor shall they raise an obstacle as regards the conclusion of such agreements in the future, provided that the latter do not establish a regime which is less favourable than or opposed to the abovementioned provisions. 
###INTERPRETATIVE NOTE

These Principles are inter-related and each Principle should be construed in the context of the other Principles.  

4. In the light of its adoption of principles governing international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development, the Conference has recognized the necessity of achieving the broadest possible measure of agreement at the earliest possible moment on a set of Principles, and has recommended that the institutional machinery proposed by the Conference should continue efforts to that end (see Annex A.I.3.).    

### SECTION  II  

####INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY PROBLEMS

5. In order to deal with the problems facing the primary commodity trade of developing countries the Conference has recommended that the provisions outlined below should be considered as means of increasing the export earnings of the developing countries by general measures as well as by specific measures related to individual commodities and, that, to this end, practical steps should be taken by governments concerned to implement at the earliest possible date those of the following provisions which are applicable in the light of certain considerations (see Annex A.II.1), as solutions of the urgent problems of developing countries. 

(a) Provisions for international commodity arrangements with a basic objective of stimulating a dynamic and steady growth and ensuring reasonable predictability in the real export earnings of the developing countries so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic and social development, while taking into account the interests of consumers in importing countries, through remunerative, equitable and stable prices for primary commodities, having due regard to their import purchasing power, assured satisfactory access and increased imports and consumption, as well as co-ordination of production and marketing policies (see Annexes A.II.1 and A.II.2);  

(b) Provisions for a programme of measures and actions for the removal of obstacles (tariff, non-tariff and other) and discriminatory practices and for expansion of market opportunities for primary commodity exports and for increases in their consumption and imports in developed countries (see Annex A.II.1 and A.II.2.).    

6. The Conference has given general approval to the establishment of a commission on commodity arrangements and policies within the framework of the continuing institutional machinery which will be established following the UNCTAD. The Conference has also generally formulated terms of reference for the new commission and requested that they be given prompt and favourable consideration by the continuing institutional machinery (see Annex A.II.1).  

7. The Conference has also adopted recommendations for active measures to promote market opportunities for primary commodity exports and for increases in consumption and imports in both developed and developing countries. It has expressed the belief that food aid should become an integral and continuing part of international aid under the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It has also recommended special action, both national and international, to deal with cases where natural products exported by developing countries face competition from synthetics and other substitutes. It has also recommended, *inter alia*, the study and preparation of a programme of action for the organization of commodity trade (see Annexes A.II.3, A.II.4, A.II.5, A.II.6, A.II.7 and A.II.8).  

8. The Conference has noted the heavy dependence of some developing countries on foreign exchange earnings from the export of minerals and fuels, and has recommended that the developed countries should effectively reduce and/or eliminate barriers and discrimination to the trade and consumption of those products, particularly internal taxation, with a view to increasing the real income of the developing countries from the said exports. It has also recommended action to provide the developing countries producing minerals and fuels with an appreciable increase in the revenues which accrue to them as a result of the export of these natural resources (see Annex A.II.9).    

### SECTION  III  

####TRADE IN MANUFACTURES AND SEMIMANUFACTURES

9. The Conference recognizes the urgent need for the diversification and expansion of the export trade of developing countries in manufactures and semi-manufactures as a means of accelerating their economic development and raising their standards of living. It considers that individual and joint action by both developed and developing countries is necessary to enable the latter to obtain increased participation commensurate with the needs of their development in the growth of international trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured products.  

10. The Conference has adopted a series of recommendations designed to help in the promotion of industries with an export potential and in the expansion of their export trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures. These recommendations deal with the following questions: 

(a) Industrial development (see Annex A.III.l), dealing with the creation of a specialized agency for industrial development;  

(b) Industrial branch agreements on partial division of labour (see Annex A.III.2);  

(c) The establishment and expansion of industries with an export potential (see Annex A.III.3).    

11. The Conference has recommended the adoption by governments participating in the Conference of certain guidelines in their foreign trade and assistance policies and programmes providing for increased access in the largest possible measure to markets for manufactured and semi-manufactured products of interest to developing countries, so as to enable these countries to increase and diversify their exports of these products on a stable and lasting basis. These guidelines also include appropriate provision by developing and developed countries for co-operation between governments and private groups to build up export production in developing countries (see Annexes A.III.4 and A.III.6).  

12. The Conference has noted both the agreement signified by all developing countries and a great majority of the developed countries with the principle of assisting the industrial development of developing countries by the extension of preferences in their favour and the opposition to this principle expressed by some developed countries. The Conference has recommended that the Secretary-General of the United Nations establish a Committee of governmental representatives to consider the matter with a view to working out the best method of implementing such preferences on the basis of non-reciprocity from the developing countries as well as to discuss, further differences of principle involved (see Annex A.III.5).  

13. The Conference has adopted a recommendation based on the readiness of the centrally planned economies to take action with a view to increasing through appropriate measures the import of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries (see Annex A.III.7).  

14. The Conference has adopted a recommendation outlining practical measures for promotion of trade in manufactures and semimanufactures among developing countries (see Annex A.III.8).  

15. The Conference has also adopted a recommendation calling on developed countries to take certain measures, *inter alia*, on import promotion and industrial adjustment (see Annex A.III.6).    

### SECTION  IV  

####FINANCING FOR AN EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE INVISIBLE TRADE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

16. On the main issues before the Conference on the financing of development, trade and invisible transactions, a large consensus of agreement was reached, though complete agreement was not always achieved.  

17. The Conference recognizes the wide concern expressed regarding the inadequacy of the growth target of 5 per cent per annum set for the United Nations Development Decade. The Conference asknowledges the need for steps to be taken, by both developing and developed countries, to mobilize domestic and international resources for accelerated growth in developing countries at rates even higher than envisaged for the Development Decade where feasible; and that the economic situations, policies and plans of individual developing countries be examined for this purpose with the consent of the country concerned. The Conference also recognizes in this connexion that the import capacity of developing countries, resulting from the combined total of export proceeds, invisible earnings and capital inflow, and taking into account the evolution of prices, should rise sufficiently, and the measures taken by the developing countries themselves should be adequate, so as to enable these higher rates of growth to be achieved; and that all countries, developed and developing, should undertake, individually and in co-operation, such measures as may be necessary to ensure this. The Conference has also recommended that each economically advanced country should endeavour to supply, in the light of principles set forth in Annex A.IV.1, financial resources to the developing countries of a minimum net amount approaching as nearly as possible to 1 per cent of its national income, having regard, however, to the special position of certain countries which are net importers of capital (see Annex A.IV.2). The Conference has also adopted a recommendation providing, *inter alia*, that the rate of interest of government loans to the developing countries should not normally exceed 3 per cent (see Annex A.IV.3).  

18. The Conference has adopted recommendations concerning terms and conditions of financial and technical co-operation provided by industrialized countries through bilateral and multilateral programmes of assistance to developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.1, A.IV.3 and A.IV.4).  

19. The Conference has proposed certain measures to deal with the increasing burden of accumulated debt and service payments in developing countries, with the objective of facilitating, whenever warranted and under appropriate conditions, the re-scheduling or consolidation of debts with appropriate periods of grace and amortization, and reasonable rates of interest (see Annexes A.IV.1 and A.IV.5). It has also approved the possibility of deliveries on credit of industrial equipment reimbursable in goods (see Annex A.IV.6).  

20. The Conference has adopted the following recommendations proposing measures and studies concerning an increase in the volume or an improvement in the terms of financing for developing countries: 

(a) Recommendations concerning a United Nations Capital Development Fund (see Annex A.IV.7), the gradual transformation of the United Nations Special Fund (see Annex A.IV.8);  

(b) The provision of aid for development on a regional basis (see Annexes A.IV.9 and A.IV.10);  

(c) The promotion of the flow of public and private capital both to the public and private sectors in developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.11, A.IV.12 and A.IV.13);  

(d) Review of the use and terms of credit, export financing and marketing, and credit insurance (see Annexes A.IV.14, A.IV.15 and A.IV.16).    

21. The Conference has recognized further that adverse movements in the export proceeds of developing countries can be disruptive of development. The Conference has, therefore, recommended that, as regards payments difficulties caused by temporary export shortfalls, members of the International Monetary Fund should study certain measures with a view to liberalizing the terms of the compensatory credit system operated by the Fund since February 1963 (see Annex A.IV.17). As regards longer-term problems, the Conference has recommended (see Annex A.IV.18): 

(a) That the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development be invited to study the feasibility of a scheme that would provide supplementary financial resources to developing countries experiencing shortfalls in export proceeds from reasonable expectations. The relevant economic circumstances for consideration would include the adverse effects of significant increases in import prices.  

(b) That the continuing machinery recommended by this Conference be invited to study and organize further discussions of concepts and proposals for compensatory financing put forward by the delegations of developing countries at the Conference, taking into account the effect of shortfalls in export earnings and adverse movements in the terms of trade.    

22. The Conference has also recommended a study of the international monetary issues relating to problems of trade and development with special reference to the objectives and decisions of this Conference (see Annex A.IV.19). It has also approved a recommendation on the participation of nationals of developing countries in the process of policy formulation in international financial and monetary agencies (see Annex A.IV.20).  

23. The Conference has agreed on a draft text containing a common measure of understanding on shipping questions, and has recommended that appropriate inter-governmental procedures, including any committee that might be deemed necessary, be established to promote understanding and co-operation in the field of shipping, and to study and report on its economic aspects (see Annexes A.IV.21 and A.IV.22).  

24. The Conference has also considered and recommended measures on insurance, tourism, technical assistance and transfer of technology, taking into account the need to improve the invisible trade of developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.23, A.IV.24, A.IV.25 and A.IV.26).    

### SECTION  V  

####INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

25. The Conference has recommended to the United Nations General Assembly that it adopt at its nineteenth session the following provisions, *inter alia:* 

(a) The present United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should be established as an organ of the General Assembly to be convened at intervals of not more than three years and with a membership comprising those states which are members of the United Nations, the specialized agencies, or the I.A.E.A.  

(b) The principal functions of the Conference shall be: 

(i) To promote international trade, especially with a view to accelerating economic development, particularly trade between countries at different stages of development, between developing countries and between countries with different systems of economic and social organization, taking into account the functions performed by existing international organizations;  

(ii) To formulate principles and policies on international trade and related problems of economic development;  

(iii) To make proposals for putting the said principles and policies into effect and to take such other steps within its competence as may be relevant to this end, having regard to differences in economic systems and stages of development;  

(iv) Generally, to review and facilitate the co-ordination of activities of other institutions within the United Nations system in the field of international trade and related problems of economic development and in this regard to co-operate with the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in respect to the performance of their Charter responsibilities for co-ordination;  

(v) To initiate action, where appropriate, in co-operation with the competent organs of the United Nations for the negotiation and adoption of multilateral legal instruments in the field of trade, with due regard to the adequacy of existing organs of negotiation and without duplication of their activities;  

(vi) To be available as a centre for harmonizing the trade and related development policies of governments and regional economic groupings in pursuance of Article 1 of the United Nations Charter; and  

(vii) To deal with any other matters within the scope of its competence.    

(c) A permanent organ of the Conference, to be known as the Trade and Development Board, should be established as part of the United Nations machinery in the economic field, consisting of 55 members elected by the Conference from among its membership, with full regard for both equitable geographical distribution and the desirability of continuing representation for the principal trading states.  

(d) For the effective discharge of its functions, the Board should establish such subsidiary organs as may be necessary, and in particular three committees - on commodities, manufactures, and invisibles and financing related to trade.  

(e) Each State represented on the Conference should have one vote. Subject to provisions to be determined by the General Assembly at its nineteenth session after consideration by it of a report and proposals to be made by a Special Committee to be appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, decisions of the Conference on matters of substance should be taken by a two-thirds majority of the representatives present and voting, and decisions of the Board by simple majority. The task of the Special Committee shall be to prepare proposals for procedures within the continuing machinery designed to establish a process of conciliation to take place before voting and to provide an adequate basis for the adoption of recommendations with regard to proposals of a specific nature for action substantially affecting the economic or financial interests of particular countries.  

(f) Arrangements should be made, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, for the immediate establishment of an adequate, permanent and full-time secretariat within the United Nations Secretariat for the proper servicing of the Conference, the Board and its subsidiary bodies.  

(g) The Conference should review in the light of experience the effectiveness and further evolution of institutional arrangements with a view to recommending such changes and improvements as might be necessary. To this end it should study all relevant subjects including matters relating to the establishment of a comprehensive organization based on the entire membership of the United Nations system of organizations to deal with trade and with trade in relation to development (see Annex A.V.1).    

26. The Conference has also recommended action concerning interim institutional arrangements, and the terms of reference of subsidiary organs of the Trade and Development Board (see Annexes A.V.2 and A.V.3).    

### SECTION  VI  

####SPECIAL PROBLEMS

27. The Conference has requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a committee of 24 members, representing land-locked, transit and other interested states as governmental experts and on the basis of equitable geographical distribution. The said committee is to be convened during 1964 to prepare a new draft convention dealing with transit trade of land-locked countries. The Conference has recommended that the new draft convention be submitted for consideration and adoption by a conference of plenipotentiaries to be convened by the United Nations in the middle of 1965 (see Annex A.VI.1).  

28. The Conference has recommended that international organizations set up by the developing countries which are the principal exporters of non-renewable natural products be recognized and encouraged to enable them to defend their interests (see Annex A.VI.2).  

29. The Conference has also adopted a recommendation concerning expanded utilization of long-term trade agreements (see Annex A.VI.3).  

30. The Conference has recommended non-discrimination in dealing with governmental trading organizations in foreign trade (see Annex A.VI.4).    

### SECTION  VII  

####PROGRAMME OF WORK

31. In addition to the Programme of Work implied in the recommendations referred to above, the Conference has recommended the following: 

(1) A study of the feasibility of rates of growth higher than those which have been experienced by most countries individually during the past decade, and even higher than those envisaged for the United Nations Development Decade, and of measures for developing and developed countries to take to achieve them (see Annex A.IV.2);  

(2) An overall economic and social survey of the depressed areas of the developing world and of special measures to make possible immediate action to secure a substantial improvement in the living levels of the populations of these areas (see Annex A.VI.5);  

(3) A programme of work for the Commission on Commodity Arrangements and Policies, or any equivalent body that may be established within the continuing machinery, for the development of appropriate guiding lines and procedures for commodity arrangements and, in respect of commodities to which certain conditions apply, for commodity negotiations and export studies (see Annex A.II.3);  

(4) Further studies in the commodity field regarding promotion and marketing arrangements, and measures to deal with problems of substitution and various types of research aiming at an expansion of market opportunities for exports of primary commodities from developing countries (see Annexes A.II.8 and A.II.5));  

(5) Work related to the provision of economic and technical assistance with a view to expanding the export earnings of developing countries from primary commodities, semi-manufactures and finished manufactures (see Annexes A.II.8, A.II.6 and A.II.5, Annexes A.III.4 and A.III.7 and Annex A.IV.25);  

(6) A study of methods of payment that would assist in promoting trade among developing countries (see Annex A.II.6 and Annex A.III.7);  

(7) The necessary economic and statistical studies of world trade, with special reference to the problems of developing countries (see Annex A.VI.5 and Annex A.II.8);

(10) The transmittal to one of the organs to be set up by the Conference for further study of part III of the proposal concerning the use of subsidies for improving the competitive position of manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries (see report of the Second Committee, E/CONF. 46/132, para. 24);  

(11) The elaboration of trade aspects of an economic programme of disarmament (see Annex A.VI. 10).

Economic development and social progress should be the common concern of the whole international community and should by increasing economic prosperity and well-being help strengthen peaceful relations and co-operation among nations. Accordingly, all countries pledge themselves to pursue internal and external economic policies designed to accelerate economic growth throughout the world, and in particular to help promote in developing countries a rate of growth consistent with the need to bring about substantial and steady increase in average income in order to narrow the gap between the standard of living in developing countries and that in the developed countries.

International trade is one of the most important factors in economic development. It should be governed by such rules as are consistent with the attainment of economic and social progress and should not be hampered by measures incompatible therewith. All countries should co-operate in creating conditions of international trade conducive in particular to the achievement of a rapid increase in the export earnings of developing countries and in general to the promotion of an expansion and diversification of trade between “all countries, whether at similar levels of development, at different levels of development, or having different economic and social systems.

The expansion and diversification of international trade depends upon increasing access to markets, and upon remunerative prices for the exports of primary products. Developed countries shall progressively reduce and eliminate barriers and other restrictions that hinder trade and consumption of products from developing countries and take positive measures such as will create and increase markets for the exports of developing countries. All countries should co-operate through suitable international arrangements on an orderly basis in implementing measures designed to increase and stabilize primary commodity export earnings, particularly of developing countries, at equitable and remunerative prices and to maintain a mutually acceptable relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and those of primary products.

International trade should be conducted to mutual advantage on the basis of the most favoured nation treatment and should be free from measures detrimental to the trading interests of other countries. However, developed countries should grant concessions to all developing countries and extend to developing countries all concessions they grant to one another and should not in granting these or other concessions, require any concessions in return from developing countries. New preferential concessions, both tariff and non-tariff, should be made to developing countries as a whole and such preferences should not be extended to developed countries. Developing countries need not extend to developed countries preferential treatment in operation amongst them. Special preferences at present enjoyed by certain developing countries in certain developed countries should be regarded as transitional and subject to progressive reduction. They should be eliminated as and when effective international measures guaranteeing at least equivalent advantages to the countries concerned come into operation.

International institutions and developed countries should provide an increasing net flow of international financial, technical and economic assistance to support and reinforce, by supplementing the export earnings of developing countries, the efforts made by them to accelerate their economic growth through diversification, industrialization and increase of productivity on the basis of their national policies, plans and programmes of economic development. Such assistance should not be subject to any political or military conditions. This assistance whatever its form and from whatever source, including foreign public and private loans and capital, should flow to developing countries on terms fully in keeping with their trade and development needs. International, financial and monetary policies should be designed to take full account of the trade and development needs of developing countries.

In the disposal of agricultural surpluses, developed countries should undertake to apply internationally agreed criteria of surplus disposal so as not to affect adversely the export prospects of developing countries and other countries heavily dependent on the export of a narrow range of primary products, the inter and intraregional trade and agricultural development of developing countries, or of the development programmes of the countries receiving these surpluses as assistance. Internationally agreed criteria should also govern the disposal of all primary product surpluses and stockpiles. Such surpluses and stockpiles should be disposed of for the promotion of economic development of all developing countries whether producers or recipients.

All countries should support an expansion of multilateral economic assistance to developing countries especially within the framework of the United Nations, as well as bilateral assistance. Economic assistance to developing countries on a multilateral basis should be offered as grants or as loans at the lowest possible rates of interest with long periods of repayment and generous grace periods taking into account their overall repayment capacity, and should be equitable distributed on the basis of the urgency of their development needs. Economic assistance to developing countries on a bilateral basis should also be offered as grants or as loans at the lowest possible rates of interest with long periods of repayment and generous grace periods and should, as the case may either be in the form of untied loans or in kind, in particular in the form of capital equipment and technical assistance. Whenever possible the repayment of such loans and credits should be made in local currency or with the products of the recipient country and, where appropriate, with industrial products resulting from the employment of the capital equipment supplied.

### Annex  A.I.2  

####Principles relating to transit trade of land-locked countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted these principles without dissent.  </sup>    *The Conference,*  *Having regard* to the various aspects of the problem of transit trade of landlocked States, *Considering* that, for the promotion of the economic development of the landlocked States, it is essential to provide facilities to enable them to overcome the effects of their land-locked position on their trade, *Adopts* the following principles, together with the Interpretative Note: 
###PRINCIPLE I

The recognition of the right of each land-locked State of free access to the sea is an essential principle for the expansion of international trade and economic development. 
###PRINCIPLE II

In territorial and on internal waters, vessels flying the flag of land-locked countries should have identical rights and enjoy treatment identical to that enjoyed by vessels flying the flag of coastal States other than the territorial State. 
###PRINCIPLE III

In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with coastal States, States having no sea coast should have free access to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State having no sea coast shall by common agreement with the latter and in conformity with existing international conventions accord to ships flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their own ships or to the ships of any other State as regards access to sea ports and the use of such ports. 
###PRINCIPLE IV

In order to promote fully the economic development of the land-locked countries, the said countries should be afforded by all States, on the basis of reciprocity, free and unrestricted transit, in such a manner that they have free access to regional and international trade in all circumstances and for every type of goods. Goods in transit should not be subject to any customs duty. Means of transport in transit should not be subject to special taxes or charges higher than those levied for the use of means of transport of the transit country. 
###PRINCIPLE V

The State of transit, while maintaining full sovereignty over its territory, shall have the right to take all indispensable measures to ensure that the exercise of the right of free and unrestricted transit shall in no way infringe its legitimate interests of any kind. 
###PRINCIPLE VI

In order to accelerate the evolution of a universal approach to the solution of the special and particular problems of trade and development of land-locked countries in the different geographical areas, the conclusion of regional and other international agreements in this regard should be encouraged by all States. 
###PRINCIPLE VII

The facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked countries in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause. 
###PRINCIPLE VIII

The principles which govern the right of free access to the sea of the land-locked State shall in no way abrogate existing agreements between two or more contracting parties concerning the problems, nor shall they raise an obstacle as regards the conclusion of such agreements in the future, provided that the latter do not establish a régime which is less favourable than or opposed to the above-mentioned provisions. 
###INTERPRETATIVE NOTE

These Principles are inter-related and each Principle should be construed in the context of the other Principles.   

### Annex  A.I.3  

####Principles governing international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>    *The Conference,*  *Considering* that it has adopted Principles governing international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development, *In the light of* the preceding paragraph, and *Recognizing* the necessity of achieving the broadest possible measure of agreement at the earliest possible moment on a set of Principles, *Recommends* that the institutional machinery proposed by the Conference should continue efforts to that end.   

### Annex  A.II.1  

####International commodity arrangements and removal of obstacles and expansion of trade

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>  

####INTRODUCTION

*Noting* the view expressed at the Conference that access to markets is an essential element in efforts to increase the earnings of developing countries from exports of commodities, *Noting* the view expressed at the Conference that there is need for a more rational organization of world trade in primary commodities, through medium and long-term structural arrangements, *Noting* the view expressed at the Conference that, in order to solve the problems of commodity trade, measures for liberalization of access to markets and measures for commodity agreements should be simultaneously undertaken as separate but complementary measures, *Noting* the view expressed at the Conference that, owing to the particular features of each commodity market and the variety of national policies governing commodity trade at present, a commodity-by-commodity approach is needed, with solutions adapted to the commodity concerned and with recourse in varying degrees to measures for the liberalization of trade and to medium and long-term structural arrangements, *Noting* the general agreement expressed at the Conference that commitments undertaken in other international bodies should be maintained and that the efforts under way in other international bodies to help the developing countries should be pursued along with the new co-operative efforts as result from this Conference, *The Conference recommends* that the provisions of I and II attached hereto be considered as means of increasing the export earnings of the developing countries by general measures as well as by specific measures related to individual commodities and that, to this end, practical steps should be taken by the Governments concerned to implement at the earliest possible date those of their provisions which are applicable in the light of the foregoing considerations, as solutions of the urgent problems of developing countries.  

### I  

####INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS

*Recognizing* that commodity arrangements serve to secure over-all stabilization in primary commodity markets, the Conference stresses the special role they should perform in stimulating the economic development of the developing countries. With reference to this role, *the Conference recommends* that commodity arrangements should have the following objective, principles and scope. 

### A  

####OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES

1. A basic objective of international commodity arrangements is in general to stimulate a dynamic and steady growth and ensure reasonable predictability in the real export earnings of developing countries, so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic and social development, while taking into account the interests of consumers in importing countries.  

2. To achieve this objective, international commodity arrangements should: 

*a.* Secure remunerative, equitable and stable prices for primary commodities, especially those exported by developing countries, having due regard for the import purchasing power of the commodities exported;  

*b.* Aim to increase, particularly in developed countries, the consumption and imports of primary commodities, including those in semi-processed and processed forms, from developing countries;  

*c.* Assure satisfactory access to the markets of the developed countries for the primary products of developing countries as appropriate in the context of commodity arrangements;  

*d.* Co-ordinate commodity production and marketing policies as appropriate for the purpose of: 

(i) Ensuring a better and more economic adjustment between world consumption and production and mitigating any detrimental effects of residual burdensome surpluses or deficits;  

(ii) Preventing excessive fluctuations in prices and price relationships in quantities traded;  

(iii) Ensuring that adequate measures for increasing consumption and imports are taken before resorting to measures to restrict production and exports;  

(iv) Promoting production and equitable distribution of commodities in short supply;  

(v) Ensuring that developed countries do not take measures which would encourage uneconomic production and so deprive developing countries of the opportunity to obtain a fair and reasonable share of their markets and of market growth;  

(vi) Facilitating the long-term adjustment of production required by structural changes in world markets.        

### B  

####TYPES OF COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS

3. To reach objectives stated above, various types of arrangements can be made, ranging from formal commodity agreements (including possible compensation agreements) to less formal arrangements, such as inter-governmental consultations within commodity study groups.  

4. International commodity arrangements should be usually on a commodity-by-commodity basis and, as far as each commodity is concerned, should take due account of the interests of exporting and importing countries, of the characteristics of the product concerned and of the trade in, and the market arrangements for, that product.  

5. Commodity arrangements may, however, also cover groups of commodities under certain circumstances. Where the negotiation of arrangements for a group of commodities is considered desirable but does not appear practicable, the possibility of negotiating simultaneously a number of separate arrangements for different commodities can be considered. In any case, there will be considerable advantage in providing, within the institutional machinery that may be set up, a common forum for consultation and confrontation where the related aspects of all these arrangements may be periodically considered.    

### C  

####SCOPE OF COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS

6. An attempt should be made to extend the scope of commodity arrangements and make them comprehensive so that, in addition to provisions on prices and quantities commercially traded, these may include, *inter alia,* provisions on the following: 

*a.* Co-ordination of national production and consumption policies, as far as possible;  

*b.* Realistic guarantees to developing countries of terms of access to markets of developed countries ensuring a fair and reasonable share of the market and of market growth;  

*c.* Market promotion and improvement of marketing conditions and distribution channels.    

7. In the preparation and negotiation of international commodity agreements and arrangements and in their implementation, consideration should be given to the need of retaining flexibility in the use of the techniques adopted in order (a) to increase market opportunities to efficient producers among developing countries; (b) to enable small trading developing countries and countries progressing from a subsistence to a cash economy to attain economic levels of production for the purpose of economic growth; and (c) not to obstruct the access to the market of potential producers from developing countries. In applying all these considerations, account should be taken of the trade needs of traditional producers, especially among developing countries, and the capacity of the market to absorb new production.  

8. The techniques employed under commodity arrangements should vary according to the characteristics of the commodity or groups of commodities concerned, and may include as appropriate provisions for measures such as: 

*a.* Floor and ceiling prices and price ranges;  

*b.* Quota arrangements;  

*c.* Measures for trade liberalization;  

*d.* Minimum guaranteed import volumes;  

*e.* Long-term contracts and import targets;  

*f.* Long-term purchase and sale arrangements;  

*g.* Buffer stocks schemes (including stabilization reserves) financed: 

(i) By exporting countries; and  

(ii) Jointly by importing and exporting countries;    

*h.* Systems of levies in the developed importing countries which, if adopted would provide for the reimbursement of the proceeds to the developing exporting countries through appropriate international funds;  

*i.* Operation of funds established to ensure, *inter alia,* the implementation of agreed diversification programmes of production and trade in favour of developing exporting countries;  

*j.* Systems of adequate incentives to exporting developing countries to open new markets for primary products.    

9. Before adopting any of the above techniques, consideration should be given to their likely impact on the economies of primary producing developing countries, taking into account their prospective trade needs for economic development.  

10. The sale of government-held surplus inventories, including strategic stockpiles of minerals, metals and raw materials, should be made in accordance with criteria to be agreed internationally.  

11. Disposal from agricultural surpluses should be made in accordance with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations *Principles of Surplus Disposal* and with due regard to the interests of receiving developing countries.    

### D  

####COMMISSION ON COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS AND POLICIES

12. A Commission on Commodity Arrangements and Policies should be set up by the proposed Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (or any other equivalent body that may be established) with the following terms of reference: 

(1). To exercise functions under the general guidance of the proposed Board (or any other equivalent body that may be established), to ensure general and integrated policies in the commodity field;  

(2). To co-ordinate the activities of all bodies involved in the commodity field including the appropriate organs of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as well as of the autonomous commodity councils, study groups and other commodity groups, and any commodity activities within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT);  

(3). To assume functions at present being undertaken by the Interim Co-ordinating Committee for International Commodity Arrangements (ICCICA) and specially to evaluate reports received annually, or at such other intervals as it may request from all bodies referred to above, and to make such recommendations as it deems appropriate in the light of such evaluation;  

(4). To assume functions at present being undertaken by the Commission on International Commodity Trade, including: 

*a.* Preparation of reviews of the market situation of various primary commodities, including projections of supply and demand in the commodity concerned. These studies should be carried out in co-operation with the specialized commodity groups where appropriate;  

*b.* Preparing studies of trends in international trade in primary commodities and in particular of the relationship between the prices of primary commodities and the prices of manufactured goods entering international trade;  

*c.* Making recommendations regarding short-term and long-term stabilization measures, in particular with regard to the terms of trade;  

*d.* Any member entitled to participate in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development not represented on the Commission may bring to the attention of the Commission, or to the Operational Committee referred to in paragraph (7) below, for immediate action, any development with respect to commodity markets or particular commodities, affecting it and may take part in the Commission's discussion of the problems.    

(5). To arrange for a drafting of a General Agreement on Commodity Arrangements including the objectives and principles;  

(6). To bring to the attention of the Trade and Development Board or Governments participating in the Conference its views and recommendations as to the need for governmental or inter-governmental action to deal with problems or emerging problems which its studies may disclose;  

(7). To assist it in its work, the Commission may establish, with the approval of the Board, or equivalent body to be established under UNCTAD, an Operational Committee, as well as working parties and study groups as may be necessary from time to time.    

13. *The Conference recommends* that FAO, the Contracting Parties to GATT, commodity councils and other autonomous groups take such steps as would be required to ensure that the bodies operating in the commodity field for which they are responsible submit substantive reports annually, or at such other intervals as may be requested to the Commission on Commodity Arrangements and Policies and that they receive general policy recommendations aimed at the integration and co-ordination of commodity policy in accordance with the purposes of the Commission. *The Conference further recommends* that all Governments participating in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development be made eligible to participate in all commodity groups.    

### E  

####PROGRAMME OF WORK

14. The Commission on Commodity Arrangements and Policies (or any equivalent body that may be established and, pending its establishment, the appropriate bodies of the United Nations in collaboration with FAO and other relevant international organizations) should, within a period of two years from the end of this Conference: 

*a.* Help arrange negotiations in conformity with the general objectives and principles set forth in section A above, in respect of commodities for which there is a demand for commodity arrangements from countries having a significant share in the world trade of those particular commodities and for which adequate data are available;  

*b.* Arrange expert studies in respect of commodities for which there is similar demand but for which adequate data are not available;  

*c.* Develop appropriate guide lines and procedures for commodity arrangements in the light of the general objectives and principles mentioned at section A above.    

15. The Commission shall thereafter submit regular progress reports regarding commodity arrangements to the Trade and Development Board and the Conference, taking duly into account the conclusions of the special group of governmental experts instructed to study the international organization of commodity trade.    

### F  

####GENERAL

16. In giving effect to the present provisions, consideration should be given to the need to promote the expansion of international commodity trade among the developing countries and especially within their regional groupings. This should not lead to any deterioration in the purchasing power of the developing countries in their trade with one another. In this connexion, the recommendations of the Conference on agenda item 11 (c) (Measures and actions for the promotion of trade in primary commodities among developing countries) should be taken into account.    

### II  

### A  

####ACTIONS RECOMMENDED TO BE TAKEN BY DEVELOPED MARKET ECONOMY NATIONS

###1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

*a. Commodity coverage.* In applying the following recommendations, developed countries should be guided by the lists prepared by appropriate international bodies which identify products of particular interest to developing countries, but should not assume that the recommendations are directed solely to those products. They should take account of any representations made to them regarding the interest of particular developing countries in particular products;  

*b. Exceptions.* It is recognized that, pursuant to the provisions of international commodity agreements and in other exceptional circumstances, individual developed countries may find it necessary to deviate from the following recommendations in respect of specific products. In that event, the developed countries should consult the developing countries substantially affected and take their views into account, where possible before taking action, and otherwise seek to limit possible adverse effects on the developing countries;  

c. *Target dates.* Developed countries should seek to implement the recommendations in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 below at the earliest possible date, bearing in mind the developing countries' desire that maximum progress be made by 31 December 1965, and that the actions contemplated should be completed to the fullest extent possible by the end of the United Nations Development Decade.   
###2. STANDSTILL

No new tariff or non-tariff barriers should be created (or existing barriers increased) by developed countries against imports of primary products of particular interest to developing countries. 
###3. REMOVAL OF OBSTACLES TO TRADE

*Tariff and internal fiscal charges*  Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements referred to in paragraph 6 below, the developed countries should: 

*a.* Substantially reduce, and where possible eliminate, customs charges on primary products of particular interest to the trade of developing countries;  

*b.* Eliminate all customs charges on imports of tropical products at the earliest possible date, but in any event by the end. of the United Nations Development Decade;  

*c.* Progressively reduce, and as soon as possible eliminate, internal charges and revenue duties specifically applied to primary products wholly or mainly produced in developing countries;  

*d.* Substantially reduce, and where possible eliminate, tariffs applying to the semiprocessed and processed forms of primary products of particular interest to the developing countries;  

*e.* Progressively enlarge any tariff-free quotas which are maintained by them, until tariffs are eliminated.   
###4. QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS

Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements referred to in paragraph 6, below, 

*a.* Developed countries should eliminate in so far as possible their quantitative restrictions on products of particular interest to developing countries within the Development Decade;  

*b.* When it is necessary for a developed country to maintain quantitative restrictions for balance-of-payments or other compelling reasons, it should apply such restrictions in a non-discriminatory way. It should also periodically review, and in so far as possible modify, these restrictions with a view to allowing developing countries exporting the products an opportunity to share in market growth.   
###5. DOMESTIC POLICIES AFFECTING TRADE IN PRIMARY PRODUCTS

Developed countries, in formulating and implementing their domestic policies affecting trade in primary products, should not take measures which stimulate in their countries uneconomic production in such a way as to deprive developing countries of the opportunity to obtain a fair and reasonable share of world markets and market growth. Where existing levels of protection have adverse effects upon the trade and trade opportunities of developing countries, developed countries should aim to modify the form or reduce the aggregate of such protection. 
###6. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

Preferential arrangements between developed countries and developing countries which involve discrimination against other developing countries and which are essential for the maintenance and growth of the export earnings and for the economic advancement of the less developed countries at present benefiting therefrom, should be abolished *pari passu* with the effective application of international measures providing at least equivalent advantages for the said countries. These international measures should be introduced gradually in such a way that they become operative before the end of the United Nations Development Decade.  

### B  

####Action recommended to be taken by the developed centrally-planned economy countries

###7. THE COUNTRIES WITH CENTRALLY-PLANNED ECONOMIES SHOULD:

*a.* Refrain from taking any measures which would adversely affect the expansion of imports from the developing countries;  

*b.* Take duly into consideration the trade needs of the developing countries when fixing the quantitative targets in their long-term economic plans and concluding long-term agreements and contracts, so that it should result in a steady growth of their imports of primary products and semi-processed products from the developing countries and should constitute a proportion of growing importance in their total imports.   8. In all matters affecting decisions relating to imports they should, within the framework of their trade system, grant such favourable terms to imports from the developing countries and to consumption of products imported. 9. The centrally-planned economy countries should abolish, not later than 31 December 1965, customs duties on primary products both imported from and originating in the developing countries. 10. The centrally-planned economy countries should develop not only bilateral but also multilateral trade with the developing countries, whichever form would be considered more desirable by the trading partners concerned, with a view to permitting a more flexible use of the export receipts of the developing countries.  

### C  

####Action recommended to be taken by all developed countries

###11. EXPORT SUBSIDIES

Developed countries should avoid subsidization of exports of primary products which cause direct or indirect injury to the exports of developing countries. Even where, in consequence of domestic price supports, subsidies are needed to maintain traditional exports essential to a country's foreign trade earnings, and maintain world supplies at a level commensurate with world needs, the countries concerned should avoid applying subsidies in such a way as to restrict the market opportunities of developing countries or to depress world prices. Developed countries applying subsidies should, upon request, consult with the developing countries concerned with a view to determining the effect of the subsidies upon the present and potential export earnings of the developing countries, and, where possible adverse effects are indicated, seek to limit the use of the subsidies in question. 
###12. MIXING REGULATIONS

Developed countries should modify and eliminate any mixing regulations which limit access to markets for products of particular interest to the trade of developing countries. 
###13. DISPOSAL OF AGRICULTURAL SURPLUSES, STOCKPILES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT HELD SURPLUS INVENTORIES

*a.* In the disposal of agricultural surpluses, developed countries should undertake, if they have not already done so, to apply the FAO *Principles of Surplus Disposals* so as not to affect adversely the exports prospects of developing countries and other countries highly dependent on a narrow range of primary products, the intra-regional trade and agricultural development of developing countries, or the position of countries receiving these surpluses as assistance;  

*b.* The sale of surplus inventories, including strategic stockpiles of minerals, metals and raw materials, accumulated in developed countries should also be affected in accordance with internationally determined criteria, designed to ensure that such sales do not depress the prices of the commodities concerned or distort world trade to the detriment of exports from developing countries.   
###GENERAL PRINCIPLE

14 Developed countries should grant developing countries the benefits of the above measures without requiring reciprocity.  

### Annex  A.II.2  

####Implementation

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   

1. In the formulation of its conclusions and recommendations on matters of international commodity trade, the Conference has been guided by the following two main considerations: 

(i) The outstanding importance of commodity trade for economic development, particularly of the developing countries;  

(ii) The special difficulties affecting trade in primary commodities.    

2. These considerations underline the importance and urgency of actions that need to be taken by governments, individually and jointly, over a wide front and on dynamic and comprehensive lines, so as to conduct a concerted attack on international commodity problems.     

### Annex  A.II.3  

####Consideration of principles and guide-lines

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   
###THE CONFERENCE

*Recommends* that the principles and general guide-lines submitted to the First Committee and contained in paragraphs 1-22 of UNCT AD/WORKING Paper/ C.l/WP.2/1 be remitted to the Commission for Commodity Arrangements and Policies, or whatever corresponding body may be established following this Conference, in connexion with the development of guide-lines and principles on commodity policies and commodity arrangements as proposed in paragraph 14 (c) of Annex A.II.l.   

### Annex  A.II.4  

####Promotional measures

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference recommends* that the organization that may be set up following upon this Conference should promote, within the United Nations family, arrangements for: 

*a.* Studies into how national production and marketing arrangements and international arrangements could complement one another in the marketing of primary products;  

*b.* Periodic reviews of marketing methods and costs;  

*c.* Inter-governmental action for research into improved marketing techniques, the organisation of trade fairs, the dissemination of market intelligence and the simplification of formalities relating to customs procedure, commercial travel, etc.;  

*d.* Inter-governmental action for research to promote consumption (including new uses) of primary commodities;  

*e.* Promoting wider implementation of grading and quality standards recognized internationally (or where such standards do not yet exist, to be devised with the aid of appropriate international organizations) for the primary products exported by developing countries;  

*f.* Facilitating the establishment in developing countries of plants processing local raw materials to produce exportable products;  

*g.* Within the framework of its organizational structure, establishing a centre, with regional sub-centres, for trade information and market research.     

### Annex  A.II.5  

####Promotion of trade between developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference recommends* as follows: 
### *Action recommended to be taken by developing countries* 

*a.* Developing countries should liberalize and strengthen the trade and monetary relations which they maintain with each other, with a view to expanding mutual trade in primary commodities within the framework of co-ordinated action programmes and national development plans;  

*b.* Developing countries should integrate external trade into their national development plans;  

*c.* Developing countries should co-ordinate development plans for external trade, transport and communications in order to increase continental and inter-continental trade;  

*d.* Developing countries should co-operate with the Trade Information and Market Research Centre and regional sub-centres referred to in Annex A.II.4 in order to facilitate trade in primary commodities between developing countries;  

*e.* Developing countries should encourage the establishment or regional payments unions in order to facilitate the transfer of credit balances, and this within the framework of existing regional economic groupings or those to be set up;  

*f.* Developing countries should provide for preferential arrangements in order to promote an increase in trade between developing countries at the regional and sub-regional level; such arrangements should not, in principle, adversely affect the exports of other developing countries;  

*g.* Developing countries should grant each other mutually in primary products the most advantageous commercial treatment which they grant to developed countries.   
### *Action recommended to be taken by developed countries* 

*h.* Developed countries should assist interested developing countries with technical and other assistance towards attaining greater knowledge of the markets of other developing countries. In their aid programmes they should also take note of the need to improve transport facilities between developing countries;  

*i.* Developed countries should co-operate in facilitating primary commodity trade between developing countries, refraining from any action which hinders the process of liberalization and strengthening of such trade;   
### *International action* 

*j.* United Nations technical assistance should be provided to improve developing countries' knowledge of one another's markets and to help overcome the practical difficulties which, at present, limit trade in primary commodities between developing countries;  

*k.* International financial institutions should study methods of payment, agreed to between developing countries, which would promote their trade in primary commodities, and should assist in the adoption and implementation of such methods. <sup> 1  The First Committee took note of the statement made by a representative of the International Monetary Fund on 4 June 1964 (see E/CONF.46/C.1/SR.68).  </sup>   
### *General* 

The recommendations which appear in Annex A.II.4 for positive measures of a promotional nature are also applicable to the expansion of trade among developing countries.   

### Annex  A.II.6  

####World Food Aid Programme

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   1. *The Conference recommends* that, in the review of the present experimental World Food Programme which will be conducted by the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1965, due attention be paid to the possibilities of modifying the programme, along the lines suggested in paragraphs 42 and 43 of the report of the First Committee (E/CONF.46/131), so that the Programme may hereafter benefit both food-deficient developing countries and food-exporting developing countries, and that in the documentation to be presented in connexion with that review due account be taken of the relationship and effects of such a modified programme on the expansion and development of the commodity trade of the developing countries. 2. The foregoing should not, however, preclude bilateral arrangements for the disposal of surplus food and agricultural products in accordance with the FAO *Principles of Surplus Disposal*.   

### Annex  A.II.7  

####Competition from synthetics and substitutes

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   

1. Recognizing that the types of action reviewed in the section relating to the removal of obstacles to trade in primary commodities might prove of limited value in the case of natural products facing competition from synthetics and other substitutes, the Conference recommends that special action of a national and international character be taken with a view to: 

(i) Raising the technical efficiency of the production of natural products so as to reduce cost;  

(ii) Improving quality and grading practices;  

(iii) Intensifying technical and market research on the uses of natural products;  

(iv) Prohibiting by appropriate means the representation of a synthetic product as if it were a natural one;  

(v) Granting appropriate consideration to the phenomenon of inter-changeability of certain products in the determination of agricultural and industrial policies, particularly in the developed countries;  

(vi) Improving the statistical information regarding both natural and synthetic sectors of the industries, particularly with regard to current and planned productive capacity and end-uses by the fullest possible exchange of information about future investment plans and consumption trends, through the appropriate international bodies;  

(vii) Increasing access to developed countries' market for natural and semi-processed products facing competition from synthetics, and progressively reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers against these natural and semi-processed products with a view to their final elimination; <sup> 1  See paragraph 16 of the report of the Working Group on Synthetics, Annex A to the report of the First Committee (E/CONF.46/131).  </sup>  

(viii) Giving special attention in study groups or in the negotiation and operation of international commodity agreements to the need for measures to mitigate short-term fluctuations in the prices of the natural products facing competition from synthetics;  

(ix) Bringing about as much co-ordination as possible in investment planning and policies in the field of the natural and synthetic sectors;  

(x) Introducing where appropriate financial measures with a view to reducing the impact of the development of synthetics on the long-term prospects for the export earnings of developing countries and to assist them in undertaking the necessary structural adjustments;  

(xi) Where feasible and necessary, and taking account of the studies recommended in 4 (c), adopt mixing regulations or comparable actions in order to ensure that the proportion of utilization of natural products is not reduced.    

2. *The Conference recommends* that countries, particularly developed countries, should avoid giving special encouragement to the production of new synthetics which may displace other natural products and to additional investment in the production of synthetic materials competing with the natural products exported by the developing countries, especially when such investment can be employed more effectively in other fields; and, in exceptional cases requiring a departure from this principle, consultations be held with the developing countries likely to be adversely affected, or with the appropriate international bodies, in order to consider forms of co-operation, including financial measures, to mitigate such adverse effects.  

3. Stressing the need to keep under continuing scrutiny the problem resulting from the development of synthetic substitutes, *the Conference recommends* that consideration be given by appropriate bodies within the United Nations family, especially those bodies which might be created following the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to the establishment of a permanent sub-group to deal with the problems of commodities affected by competition from synthetic substitutes and other substitute products. The sub-group should give consideration to studies being carried out in this field, and in the meantime these studies should be vigorously pursued.  

4. *The Conference recommends* that studies be made on the following points: 

*a.* Feasibility of agreements covering both the natural product and its synthetic substitutes;  

*b.* Possible role of long-term contracts (up to 10 years) in stabilizing the market for particular natural products; consideration of new techniques for extending the scope and applicability of such contracts;  

*c.* Feasibility of mixing regulations.       

### Annex  A.II.8  

####Study of organization of commodity trade

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 86 votes to 3, with 15 abstentions.  </sup>   
###THE CONFERENCE

1. *Recommends* the establishment by the first session of the Trade and Development Board, within the framework of the institutional machinery and the programme of work to be decided by the Conference, of an *ad hoc* working party of government experts responsible for studying the proposals and preparing a progiamme of action for the international organization of commodity trade which will ensure that the developing countries will at all times be able to market their export products in increasing quantities and at remunerative prices, the “purchasing power” of which should not decline in relation to the prices of the essential goods imported by those countries, devoting their attention during the first stage to the commodities of greatest importance to the international trade of the developing countries. The *ad hoc* working party should meet in Januari 1965 and submit its report in good time so that it can be considered by the Commission on Commodity Arrangements and Policies;  

2. *Invites* the Governments of the States Members of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies to submit to the Secretary-General of the Conference before 1 January 1965 proposals and comments concerning the problems involved in the international organization of the commodity trade, in order that these proposals and comments may be considered by the *ad hoc* working party. The working party shall also take into consideration the work done in this field by the specialized agencies, as well as any relevant recommendations adopted by the Conference.     

### Annex  A.II.9  

####Minerals and fuels

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 79 votes to 15, with 12 abstentions.  </sup>   
###THE CONFERENCE

*Noting* the heavy dependence of some developing countries on foreign exchange earnings from the export of minerals and fuels, *Taking into account* the adverse effects of the high rate of taxation levied by the developed countries on those products, *Noting further* the view expressed in the Conference that access to markets is an essential element in efforts to increase the earnings of developing countries from the aforesaid exports, *Recognizing* that these resources are limited and non-renewable, 

1. *Recommends* that the developed countries should effectively reduce and/or eliminate barriers and discrimination to the trade and consumption of those products, particularly internal taxation, with a view to increasing the real income of the developing countries from the said exports;  

2. *Recommends* that action be taken in order to provide to developing countries producing minerals and fuels an appreciable increase in the revenues which accrue to them as a result of the export of these natural resources and to ensure the maximum utilization of such resources for their own industrial development, on the basis of appropriate forms of co-operation.     

### Annex  A.III.1  

####Expansion of United Nations activities in the field of industrialization

Establishment of a United Nations specialized agency for industrial development*

1. The Conference recognizes that, for the purpose of attaining the highest possible degree of diversification of their industrial structure enabling them to promote and diversify their exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures, the developing countries need the broadest possible international co-operation.  

2. It therefore endorses the draft resolution submitted to the Economic and Social Council by the Committee for Industrial Development in its report on the fourth session , in which the said Committee states as follows: <sup> 1  E/3869.  </sup> 

“1. ....  

“2. *Declares* that there is an urgent need to establish a specialized agency for industrial development within the framework of the United Nations family, in order to assist developing countries in the promotion and acceleration of industrialization;  

“3. *Requests* the Secretary-General to prepare a study on the scope, structure and functions of this agency, including draft statutes and information on the steps required to bring such an organization into operation, taking into account the views expressed by the Committee for Industrial Development at its fourth session, by theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and by the Economic and Social Council at its thirty-seventh session, and to submit this study to the nineteenth session of the General Assembly;  

“4. *Recommends* to the General Assembly, at its nineteenth session to consider the deliberations of the Committee for Industrial Development at its fourth session, of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and of the Economic and Social Council at its thirty-seventh session, and the study requested in paragraph 3 above, with a view to expediting action towards the establishment of such an organization.”    

3. Accordingly, *the Conference recommends* that the General Assembly at its nineteenth session should take suitable action with a view to the establishment of a specialized agency for industrial development, which should assume the following functions, among others: 

*a.* To compile, analyze, interpret and publish information concerning industrial technology, production, programming and planning;  

*b.* To co-operate with existing regional economic commissions in assisting the regional planning of industrial development of developing countries and within the framework of regional and sub-regional economic groupings among those countries where they exist;  

*c.* In connexion with the objectives stated under (b) above, to study and recommend special measures for adapting and co-ordinating the measures adopted so that in particular the less advanced of the developing countries will receive a strong impetus to their growth;  

*d.* To promote, and where necessary, to recommend national, regional and international action tending to speed up the industrial development of developing countries;  

*e.* To contribute actively to scientific research into the problems of industrial technology, production, programming and planning;  

*f.* To propose programmes for the improvement of instruction and administration in the matter of industrial technology, production, programming and planning;  

*g.* To offer advice and guidance on the efficient use of natural resources, by-products and new products of developing countries with a view to increasing their industrial productivity and also contribution to the diversification of their economies;  

*h.* To conduct research relating to domestic and external market demands and available raw materials;  

*i.* To provide technical assistance through its own regular budget as well as through funds allocated by other agencies;  

*j.* To study the formulation of credit policies designed to promote the industrial expansion of the developing countries and to stimulate their exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures;  

*k.* To co-operate with the other specialized agencies in the training of the staff needed for the accelerated industrial development of the developing countries.    

4. The Conference propose that, pending the establishment of a specialized agency for industrial development, the existing Centre for Industrial Development of the United Nations should, in addition to its existing functions, fulfil the functions specified above.     

### Annex  A.III.2  

####Industrial branch agreements on partial division of labour between developing countries and developed countries which are interested in this form of co-operation and for which this scheme is applicable

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 84 votes to 1, with 22 abstentions.  </sup>   

I. Recognizing the vital need for - 

*a.* Diversifying and expanding exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of the developing countries;  

*b.* Promoting industrialization and establishing export industries in developing countries on the broad basis of world markets and within the framework of an international division of labour;  

*c.* Progressive processing and fabricating of raw materials at higher levels; and  

*d.* Rapid restructuring of the trade between presently developing countries and the developed countries on the basis of, *inter alia*, the cross-flows of sophisticated manufactures;   the *Conference recommends*, amongst practical measures which could be taken with these ends in view, a new type of international co-operation in the form of industrial branch agreements between the countries concerned based on partial division of labour aimed at promoting the existing and establishing new export industries in the developing countries.  

II. In the case of the industrial branch agreements between developing countries and centrally planned economies, the principal features of such agreements may be described as follows: 

1. *Long-term bilateral or multilateral agreements.* The agreements, because of their very nature, will have to be concluded on a long-term basis. They may be either of bilateral or multilateral character. The latter form would apply to cases where the machinery and equipment for the establishment and development of a particular export industry would be supplied by two or more countries with centrally- planned economies, and/or the export industry in question would be jointly established by two or more developing countries, and/or where the products of the particular industry could be sold to two or more countries with centrally-planned economies.  

2. *Partners to agreements.* The agreement would be concluded between the governments or trading organizations and production enterprises in countries with centially planned economies, and the governments or public and private corporations in the developing countries.  

3. *Selection of export industries.* Resource-based industries and/or industries producing manufactures of higher levels of processing may be established for which: (a) the developing country has a suitable raw material base or other suitable conditions for the development of the industry and a limited domestic demand for its products; and (b) the country with the centrally planned economy has the capacity of exporting the required machinery and equipment and associated technical assistance for their installation and operation and is prepared to adapt its development plans so as to import a stated proportion of the output of these industries.  

4. *Credit.* The country with the centrally planned economy will provide machinery and equipment to the developing countries on credit at reasonable terms and rates of interest.  

5. *Repayment of credit.* The repayment of the credit in instalments will be agreed upon between the contracting parties. It might be made by the developing countries fully or in part by: (a) exports of raw materials and other commodities until the export industry has production available for export; and (b) an agreed proportion of the output of the export industry and other specified commodities in the subsequent period until the credit is fully repaid.  

6. *Co-operation in design and research.* The agreement will include provisions tor close co-operation between the respective partners in designing the product, and research for improving the processes of production and the quality of products.  

7. *Clearance of payments.* As a rule the branch agreements will be linked to trade agreements and payments arrangements between the countries concerned. The latter should provide, to the maximum extent possible, for multilateral clearance.  

8. *Prices.* Prices of machinery and equipment and technical services provided by the countries with centrally-planned economies and those of goods exported by the developing countries will be agreed upon in the light of world prices and world standards.  

9. If required by the developing countries, countries with centrally-planned economies may assist in promoting the exports of products of the new industries to third countries. The agreement may also contain provisions dealing with reexports of the products of the new industries and other commodities.  

10. The establishment of the export industries in the developing countries under the branch agreements is designed to create complementarity of economies based on specialization and partial division of labour. The exports of these industries to countries with centrally planned economies would be expected, therefore, to continue after the credit for the machinery and equipment has been fully repaid.  

11. The negotiations concerning the conclusion of branch agreements may best be initiated through bilateral consultations. Such consultations would take place as a rule between governments; appropriate governmental institutions such as development banks; trade associations and similar bodies having sufficient general knowledge of the economies of the countries concerned. When trade co-operation between the countries has already sufficiently developed, the establishment of specific branch committees with representatives of both sides may be envisaged which would deal with the implementation of the agreements and other relevant matters as they arise.       

### Annex  A.III.3  

####Criteria for development of industries with an export potential in developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference recommends* to the Governments of developed and developing countries adopting the following measures with respect to their industrial development policies to promote the expansion of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of the developing countries. 

I. The Conference 

*a.* Recognizes the vital importance of the diversification and substantial expansion of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures by the developing countries in the process of their development;  

*b.* Realizes that the establishment and development of industries with an export potential in the developing countries is indispensable for realizing the above objectives;  

*c.* Acknowledges the fact that the policies, laws and regulations governing the establishment and development of industries with an export potential are matters for decision by each developing country concerned;  

*d.* Recognizes the importance of following efficient economic policies to the maintenance and expansion of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of the developing countries.    

II. The Conference draws the attention of the developing countries to the following which they may take into consideration: 

1. *Present and prospective demand.* It will require the survey of the present and potential demand of different categories of manufactures and semi-manufactures in foreign markets and their demand elasticities in the light of the growth trends of these economies, the existence and development of domestic industries and their competitive position.  

2. *Dynamic comparative cost advantages.* Cost elements will have to be examined from the view point of advantages in the specific endowment of natural resources, labour costs and the size of the domestic market which may be helpful in realizing the full benefits of economies of scale in the shortest possible period.  

3. *Technical know-how and skills.* The developing countries will, no doubt, take into account their ability to develop and acquire new techniques and managerial know-how and train labour required in the operation of the industries with an export potential.    

III. *The Conference recommends* that: 

*a.* The developing countries, in their industrial development programmes within the framework of overall development, should give particular attention to industries with an export potential and should make appropriate provision for their establishment and development;  

*b.* The developed countries and the appropriate international agencies, in their bilateral and multilateral, financial and technical assistance programmes, should give particular attention to industries with an export potential in the developing countries and should make appropriate provision for projects and programmes of assistance to these industries.     
###AIDS, INCENTIVES AND OTHER MEASURES FOR STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVE STRENGTH OF INDUSTRIES WITH AN EXPORT POTENTIAL IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

I. 

*a.* Recognizing the insufficient entrepreneurial, technical and managerial experience in the developing countries,  

*b.* Considering the comparatively small size of the domestic market and gross insufficiency of external economies in the developing countries, and  

*c.* Realizing the consequent high capital costs and low productivity of labour in the developing countries,    

II. *The Conference recommends, inter alia,* the following measures for the consideration and action by the developing countries: 

1. *Integration of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures in development plans and policies.* The establishment and development of industries with an export potential and other measures and policies for the promotion of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures should be included in the development plans and policies of the developing countries by giving priority treatment to the export sector in allocation of domestic and foreign exchange resources, supplies of raw materials, spare parts, power and transport and skilled manpower, financial and technical assistance and providing for other types of aids and incentives and, at the same time, without neglecting the development of industries based on the domestic market.  

2. *Productive efficiency and cost reduction programmes.* In order to raise output per worker and to formulate and execute programmes of cost reductions in industries with an export potential, the following steps, among others, may be taken: 

*a.* Modernization of and addition of balancing equipment to existing industries;  

*b.* Ensuring full utilization of the installed capacity;  

*c.* Introduction of progressive and scientific management which can employ techniques of modern industrial management such as incentives for workers, engineers, technicians and other cadres in the managerial and supervisory ranks, proper lay-out of equipment and machines, production and management accounting control, tooling facilities and systematic preventive maintenance procedures, product design, quality control, standardization, pre-shipment inspection, work performance standards, etc.  

*d.* Provision of training facilities for imparting to and improving skills of workers and technical and managerial personnel.    

3. *Standardization and quality control.* Measures should be taken to introduce standardization and quality control.  

4. *Financial, monetary, fiscal and other aids and incentives.* The governments should assist investment in industries with an export potential and the promotion of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures by ensuring adequate provision of long- and short-term credit at reasonable or concessional rates of interest and equity capital through appropriate agencies such as the commercial banks, refinance corporations for industry, export risk insurance corporation and development banks and corporations, fiscal incentives, drawbacks of customs duties and sales of purchase taxes, concessional internal freight rates, supply of scarce raw material and other measures.  

5. *Training and research facilities:* The governments should provide and/or effectively assist training facilities for workers, engineers, technicians and managerial personnel and research institutes for improving the processes of products and quality of products, designing of products, new uses of products, etc.  

6. *Technical assistance.* The governments should establish and improve the industrial extension service to help industrial enterprises to solve their technical problems and implement cost reduction programmes.  

7. *National market information and trade promotion centres.* Such centres should be established to act as an intermediary between exporters and the international and regional market information and trade promotion centres and to help exporters to promote exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures.       

### Annex  A.III.4  

####Guide-lines for tariff and non-tariff policies in respect of manufactures and semi-manufactures from developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   
###THE CONFERENCE

1. *Recognizes* the urgent need for the diversification and expansion of the export trade of developing countries in manufactures and semi-manufactures as a means of accelerating their economic development and raising their standards of living as contemplated in the objectives of the United Nations Development Decade;  

2. *Recognizes* the need for increased access on the largest possible measures to markets for manufactured products of interest to developing countries, so as to enable these countries to increase and diversify their exports of these products on a stable and lasting basis;  

3. *Considers* that individual and joint action by both developed and developing countries is necessary to enable the latter to attain increased participation commensurate with the needs of their development in the growth of international trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured products;  

4. *Notes* that a number of countries participating in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development were represented at the Meeting of Ministers of Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in May 1963 and at the Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee of the Contracting Parties at the Ministerial Level in May 1964 at which were adopted, respectively, certain Conclusions regarding Measures for the Expansion of Trade of Developing Countries as a Means of Furthering their Economic Development dated 21 May 1963 and a Resolution dated 6 May 1964;  

5. *Notes* that there is general acceptance of the principle that developed countries should not expect reciprocity for measures taken by them in trade negotiations to reduce or remove tariff and other barriers to the trade of developing countries;  

6. *Considers* that, because of the pressing need of developing countries to increase their foreign exchange earnings from the exportation of manufactured and semi-manufactured products, there are important inter-relationships between trade and assistance to industrial development which require close and continuing collaboration between international institutions in the field of trade and those concerned with technical and financial assistance to the developing countries;  

7. *Notes* that developed countries which have subscribed to commitments and understandings referred to in paragraph 4 above hereby reaffirm these commitments and understandings and express their resolve to take any further actions that may be required to implement them and thus to promote the objectives of the Development Decade.   
###ACCORDINGLY, THE CONFERENCE

8. *Recommends* to Governments participating in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to adopt the following guide lines in their foreign trade and assistance policies and programmes affecting trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries;   
###TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS

9. Developed countries should not ordinarily raise existing tariff or non-tariff barriers to exports from developing countries nor establish new tariff or non-tariff barriers or any discriminatory measures, where such action would have the effect of rendering less favourable the conditions of access into their markets of manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries. If in exceptional and compelling circumstances a developed country imposes of intensifies quantitative restrictions or increases tariffs on imports of manufactured or semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries it should consult, upon their request, the developing countries affected, bilaterally or in appropriate international institutions;  

10. Developed countries should accord high priority in international trade negotiations to according maximum reductions in and, wherever possible, elimination of duties on manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries. In these negotiations every effort should be made to secure maximum reductions in and, wherever possible, the elimination of tariff differentials which differentiate unreasonably between such products in their primary and their processed forms. The benefits of the negotiations should not be limited to countries which are members of the international organization under whose aegis the negotiations take place;  

11. Developed countries should, as a matter of urgency, remove quantitative restrictions on manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries as soon as possible;  

12. Developed countries, in co-operation with a competent international body, should proceed forthwith to identify existing non-tariff barriers to expanded trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured products of current or evident potential export interest to developing countries and should, as a matter of urgency, seek practical approaches to the maximum feasible reduction or the elimination of such barriers at an early date;  

13. Appropriate provision should be made by developing and developed countries to encourage co-operation between governments and private groups in their countries so as to build up export production in developing countries of manufactures and semi-manufactures in demand by consumers and industrial users in advanced countries. Co-operative measures should be taken to raise the level of technology and of industrial skills in the developing countries;  

14. Developed countries should participate, through the appropriate international trade body, in analyzing the development plans and policies of individual developing countries, at their request, and in examining trade and relationships with a view to devising concrete measures to promote the development of export potential and to facilitate access to export markets for the products of the industries thus developed. In this connexion they should seek appropriate collaboration with governments and international organizations having competence in relation to financial assistance for economic development, in systematic studies of trade and aid relationships in individual developing countries aimed at obtaining a clear analysis of export potential, market prospects and any further action that may be required;  

15. Developed and developing countries should collaborate in seeking methods to expand export trade of developing countries through international harmonization and adjustment of national policies and regulations, through technical and commercial standards affecting production, transportation and marketing, and through export promotion by the establishment of facilities, within individual countries or competent international organs, for the increased flow of trade information and the development of market research;  

16. When measures recommended above are insufficient to give rise to a steady and effective flow to the developed countries of processed, semi-manufactured and manufactured products from developing countries in the initial phases of industrialization, developed and developing countries should examine, through and with the appropriate international institutions, what additional and, if necessary, new ways and means can be provided to support the national development and export programmes of the least industrialized countries. In this respect, consideration should be given inter alia to channelling financial and technical assistance through appropriate international organizations, including regional economic organizations in cases where the developing countries needing such assistance are participating in regional economic programmes;  

17. In relation to the foregoing, periodic discussions and consultations should be held by developed and developing countries in appropriate international institutions for the purpose of: 

*a.* Reviewing the progress made;  

*b.* Assessing the results achieved; and  

*c.* Considering what further measures are required to meet the needs of developing countries.       

### Annex  A.III.5  

####Methods of implementing a programme of preferences in favour of developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   
###THE CONFERENCE

*Recognizing* the urgent need for the diversification and expansion of the export trade of developing countries in manufactures and semi-manufactures in order to narrow as rapidly as possible the commercial deficit resulting from the present trends in international trade, *Emphasizing* the general agreement on the objective of securing a significant increase in the participation of the developing countries in international trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures, *Noting* that all the developing countries and a great majority of the developed countries have signified their agreement with the principle of assisting the industrial development of developing countries by the extension of preferences in their favour, *Noting, on the other hand,* that some developed countries participating in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are opposed to this principle, and support instead the application of the most-favoured-nation principle in the extension of concessions by developed to developing countries. *Considering* that it would be desirable to obtain the widest possible agreement with respect to such preferences, *Noting* that a programme of work on the question of the extension of preferences in favour of developing countries has been agreed upon in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and that the Contracting Parties have affirmed their intention to go ahead with it, *Recommends* that the Secretary-General of the United Nations make appropriate arrangements for the establishment as soon as possible of a committee of governmental representatives drawn from both developed and developing countries to consider the matter with a view to working out the best method of implementing such preferences on the basis of non-reciprocity from the developing countries, as well as to discuss further the differences of principle referred to above. The Committee should take into account the recommendations, documents and declarations considered by the Conference, as well as the relevant work of other international institutions. The Committee should report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations within a time limit to be set by him. The report of the Committee should be circulated to the Governments participating in this Conference and to the continuing machinery established following the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

###I.

*The Conference,*  

*a. Recognizes* obstacles and difficulties faced by the developing countries in marketing their manufactures and semi-manufactures in the developed countries; and  

*b. Realizes* that substantial imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures may involve some readjustment in the industrial structures of the developed countries.   
###II.

*The Conference recommends* that the developed countries should consider taking, among others, the following measures: 

1. Etablishment of a focal or contact points within the appropriate government agency or other appropriate institute for the co-ordination of activities intended to enlarge the opportunities for the importation of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries;  

2. Provision of financial and technical assistance to export organizations of the developing countries to market their industrial products;  

3. Granting of favourable treatment to the industries of the developing countries with respect to the establishment of agencies, offices, consignment stocks, maintenance and repair service, etc. in the territory of the developed countries, within the framework of their national legislation;  

4. Provision of guidance to industrial entrepreneurs regarding investment opportunities in the export industries of the developing countries and familiarizing them with legal, political, economic and other relevant information on the situation in the developing countries;  

5. Arrangements for assisting the adaptation and adjustment of industries and workers in situations where particular industries and workers in those industries, are adversely affected by increased imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures;  

6. Placing no obstacles to the granting of favourable terms of production and export rights derived from the use of patents and licences;  

7. Promoting integrated programmes of manufacture and schemes of industrial co-operation between developing countries by: 

(i) Encouraging, within the framework of their national legislation, industrial groups to set up joint enterprises in developing economies for producing goods required in developed countries;  

(ii) Taking steps for bringing about adjustment in production patterns so that endowment factors of both developed and developing economies are more efficiently used for common benefit;  

(iii) Urging industrial groups to refrain from including restrictive provisions relating to the division of export markets in their collaboration agreements.    

8. Provision of technical assistance to further schemes of industrial co-operation and integrated programmes of manufacture aimed at production, in developing countries, of intermediates for purchase and use by industries in developed countries.     

### Annex  A.III.7  

####Measures by countries with centrally-planned economies for expansion and diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures by developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this recommendation by 86 votes to none, with 24 abstentions.  </sup>   The Conference notes with satisfaction statements by the delegations of countries with centrally-planned economies concerning their readiness to increase the import of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries. Accordingly, the countries with centrally-planned economies will: 

(1) Within the framework of their long-term plans, take appropriate measures which would result in the diversification and significant growth of their imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries;  

(2) Reduce or abolish Customs duties on goods imported from and originating in the developing countries;  

(3) In all matters affecting decisions regarding imports, within the framework of their system of foreign trade, grant to imports from the developing countries such favourable conditions as will result in the growth of such imports. The developing countries for their part will accord to the countries with centrally-planned economies conditions for trade not inferior to those granted normally to the developed countries with market economies;  

(4) Develop and amplify the practice of concluding with the developing countries long-term agreements concerning mutual deliveries of goods as one of the methods of promoting the steady growth of trade, and particularly the increase of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries, thereby facilitating the fulfilment of those countries' economic development plans or programmes.   The countries with centrally-planned economies: 

(5) Are prepared to ensure that the funds they receive in repayment of credits granted by them to the developing countries will be used for the purchase of goods from those countries, including manufactures and semi-manufactures, as well as products made in these countries at enterprises built with funds provided by such credits. In cases where repayments cannot be made in goods, other ways and means of repayment could be agreed upon between the partners concerned;  

(6) Are prepared to collaborate with interested developing countries in organizing co-operation in the manufacture of particular types of products especially through the conclusion of long-term agreements and contracts, and through the rendering of the necessary technical assistance;  

(7) Are prepared to engage alongside with bilateral trade also in multilateral trade when this seems economically advantageous to all interested trade partners. Countries with centrally-planned economies realize that the possibilities of conducting multilateral forms of trade and payments relations will increase with the normalization and expansion of international trade as a whole;  

(8) Are prepared to arrange for gradually facilitating the transferability of credit balances between countries with centrally-planned economies. It is understood that the desirability of such transfers is agreed upon between the partners concerned;  

(9) The countries with centrally-planned economies note that the possibilities of expanding exports from the developing countries to these countries can be used to the full alongside with increased imports from the centrally-planned economies by the developing countries;  

(10) The countries with centrally-planned economies are prepared not to reexport goods, purchased in developing countries, unless it is with the consent of the parties concerned.     

### Annex  A.III.8  

####Measures and action for the promotion of trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference,* recognizing the urgent need for closer and intensified economic co-operation among developing countries particularly in the promotion of trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among the developing countries, 
###I.

*Notes:*  

*a.* The present relatively small size of the trade in manufactures and semimanufactures among the developing countries;  

*b.* The limited size in the developing countries of national markets, the limited resources of capital, skill and foreign exchange;  

*c.* The diversity of natural resources among developing countries;  

*d.* The great advantages of: 

(i) Economies of scale and specialization offered by modern technology;  

(ii) Joint mobilization by developing countries of their resources in capital and skills;  

(iii) Developing countries exploiting their natural endowment factors in order to create complementarities of their industrial economies;     
###II.

*Further notes* the progress already achieved in some regions in promoting economic co-operation among the developing countries. 
###III.

*Considers:*  

*a.* That closer economic co-operation among developing countries through bilateral and multilateral arrangements and through regional and/or subregional groupings will greatly assist the efficient utilization of their resources and accelerate their rate of economic development, particularly of the less developed of the developing nations;  

*b.* That such co-operation should be based on mutual respect for the sovereign equality of States and mutual benefits and assistance, with due regard to the different needs of participating countries with special consideration for the requirements of the less developed of the developing countries;  

*c.* That policies and programmes aimed at expanding and diversifying trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among developing countries, within the framework of regional or sub-regional economic groupings or otherwise, should make an effective contribution to the economic development of the participating countries as well as to the expansion of world trade as a whole;  

*d.* That any forms of economic groupings should provide, in addition to cooperation with other developing countries and regional or sub-regional groups, for developing countries, not initially members, to join under equitable conditions and avoid, as far as possible, harmful effects on other developing countries;  

*e.* That if trade between the developing countries is to achieve its full potential, they may need to adopt among themselves, where feasible, preferential rules designed specifically for that purpose.   
###IV.

*Recommends:*  

*a.* That, having regard for the considerations enumerated in III above, developing countries consider the adoption of practical measures for promoting economic co-operation, both generally among themselves and within regional economic groupings, particularly in the fields of industrial development, and the growth and the diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures. These measures could include: 

(i) The exchange of information between developing countries on their industrial development plans in relation to stimulating trade and the harmonization of such plans with a view to creating integrated industries in economic regions or sub-regions with due regard to the elimination of uneconomic competition within the region or sub-region and ensuring an equitable sharing of all member countries in the region or sub-region in the process of industrialization;  

(ii) Joint facilities for, and the exchange of information on, research, standards, trade promotion and similar matters;  

(iii) Collaboration in the development of adequate transport and communication facilities;  

(iv) The promotion among developing countries of increased purchases of manufactures and semi-manufactures produced in other developing countries;  

(v) The progressive liberalization of trade between developing countries, including the simplification of trade and customs formalities. Their individual characteristics and different stages of development should be taken into account, special attention being paid to the less developed, as an effective means of ensuring sustained growth with equal opportunities for each country;  

(vi) Appropriate financial and payments arrangements;  

(vii) Close technical co-operation, including arrangements for exchange of technical information and training facilities;    

*b.* That rules governing world trade should make provision to accommodate forms of regional and sub-regional co-operation consistent with the considerations outlined in III above and taking account of the interests of third countries, especially developing countries, and in particular permit developing countries to grant each other concessions, not extended to developed countries, in view of the requirement to meet the needs during a transitional period of developing countries for the purpose of promoting their exchanges of goods and services;  

*c.* That the appropriate United Nations bodies, including regional economic commissions and other appropriate international organizations, should increase their assistance to developing countries to promote the planned co-ordinated development of industries based on complementarities of their economies and to expand trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among them.     

### Annex  A.IV.l  

####Guidelines for international financial co-operation

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference recommends* that: 

1. Financial co-operation provided by industrialized countries both through bilateral and multilateral programmes of assistance to developing countries should have the following characteristics: 

*a.* It should be directed, as far as possible, to the formulation and realization of sectoral, regional, national and multinational development programmes. To that purpose it should take into account: 

(i) The need that it be provided with a view to continuity so as to allow the most efficient planning of the economic growth of developing countries;  

(ii) The importance of well-formulated and workable development plans and programmes and of adequate measures by the developing countries for their implementation. In this regard, the developing countries should seek to mobilize internal resources to the maximum extent possible, by promoting educational and technical training; by diversifying production and encouraging improved techniques in industry; by promoting increased productivity and output of agriculture by measures including land reform where necessary; and by employing monetary, fiscal and other policies, including tax reform where necessary, designed to increase and mobilize domestic savings and foster investment;  

(iii) The importance of fostering balanced and diversified growth. To that end it should promote the process of industrialization and the diversification of the economy, including an increasing degree of processing and manufacture of primary export products. At the same time, it should take into account the close interdependance between industrial growth and the intensification of efforts to increase agricultural productivity and output;  

(iv) The characteristics, requirements and present development levels of countries being assisted, with special attention to the important differences that exist among the developing countries. To that end, technical and financial international co-operation in the less advanced among the developing countries should emphasize the formulation and improvement of their development programmes and the realization of corresponding specific projects;    

*b.* It should have enough flexibility to increase financial assistance to developing countries when - as a result of circumstances beyond their control - there is a decline in external resources available to them below the expected levels required to sustain their programmed rates of investment and growth of national income;  

*c.* It should permit as far as possible the free use of external resources in the acquisition of goods and services in those markets which offer the best conditions of price, quality and terms, including markets in the recipient and other developing countries, unless otherwise required on balance of payments grounds, although it is recognized that even such grounds do not always justify such a different course;  

*d.* It should encourage the channelling of external resources, whenever possible and appropriate, through multilateral institutions - including regional development institutions;  

*e.* It should take into account the role of national development institutions when requested by the recipient country;  

*f*. It should take into account, in establishing repayment terms and interest rates, the over-all repayment capacity of the borrowing country;  

*g.* It should take into account the possible need for financing local costs of projects or programmes;  

*h.* It should promote regional economic co-operation of developing countries and be co-ordinated with their integration efforts including, where appropriate, the fields of regional industrial development and regional trade and payments arrangements relating to intra-regional and international trade;  

*i.* Long-term financing needed for economic growth should be augmented and be made available to developing countries so as to limit the use of medium- and short-term credit to proportions compatible with the maintenance of their capacity to repay. Developing countries, in their turn, should endeavour to limit recourse to short- and medium-term credits; in this effort industrialized countries and international institutions should co-operate;  

*j.* With respect to the use of medium-term suppliers' credits, studies should be undertaken of the problems that are frequently created by international disparities in the terms of such credits and of the burden imposed by such credits on developing countries;    

2. Since external indebtedness has become and is likely to become burdensome for a number of developing countries, industrialized countries, international institutions and individual developing countries themselves should co-operate to undertake appraisals of the external indebtedness of individual developing countries, with the objective of promoting, whenever warranted and in appropriate conditions, the rescheduling or consolidation of debts with appropriate periods of grace and amortization and reasonable rates of interest;  

3. Industrialized countries and international financial institutions should undertake the necessary measures without delay to provide for the corresponding financial assistance in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph 1 above. Likewise the industrialized countries, international institutions and the developing countries themselves should reduce to a minimum the administrative requirements and formal procedures so as to facilitate the negotiations of external financial assistance and make the timely use of such assistance;  

4. Industrialized countries and regional and international organizations should endeavour to increase the flow of the technical assistance needed to accelerate the growth of developing countries, and particularly of the least developed, to achieve the maximum efficiency in the use of external resources. Technical assistance should be tailored to the requirements of each country. This assistance should be extended on such terms as to allow the developing countries full utilization and enlargement of their own technical capacity as well as the engagement abroad of the additional technical assistance necessary for the timely study and execution of specific development projects and programmes;  

5. Measures consistent with the requirements of the various development programmes should be adopted by both industrialized and developing countries to promote the flow of capital into developing countries. Such measures should include the opening of capital markets to the developing countries, either directly or through national or multilateral institutions - including regional development banks;  

6. The industrialized countries should co-operate wherever possible in the efforts made by developing countries to organize and operate their own national or regional credit insurance and export financing systems, providing the necessary technical assistance and permitting the access of these systems to their financial markets.     

### Annex  A.IV.2  

####Growth and aid

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 107 votes to none, with 9 abstentions.  </sup>   *Recognizing* the wide concern expressed regarding the inadequacy of the growth target of 5 per cent per annum for the United Nations Development Decade, and recognizing that in recent years rates of growth of national income of developing countries in the aggregate and *per capita* have been generally unsatisfactory, *Recognizing* the urgency of accelerated growth in the developing countries, *Considering* that international and national attitudes and efforts, as well as new institutional arrangements conducive to growth, are emerging, and that certain basic conditions for accelerated growth in the developing countries are being created, *Expressing the conviction* that favourable attitudes and efforts in the fields of international trade and finance, development assistance and the mobilization of domestic resources must continue, and that developed countries can increase their financial and technical assistance to developing countries, and that developing countries themselves must increase their efforts to mobilize domestic resources, 
###I

*The Conference recommends* that: 

1. The main tasks to be undertaken and the means for raising the necessary resources be recognized by developing countries themselves, on the one hand, by mobilizing domestic resources for development, and by developed countries, on the other hand, by assisting the economic growth of less developed countries;  

2. The competent international bodies, including, if appropriate, the continuing machinery recommended by this Conference, examine the economic situations and policies and development plans of individual developing countries in order to determine the feasibility of rates of growth higher than those which have been experienced by most countries individually during the past decade, and even higher .han that envisaged for the United Nations Development Decade, and to indicate measures for developing and developed countries to take to achieve them. It was recognized that there is a need for co-ordination of these studies by competent machinery within the United Nations. <sup> 1  It was felt that the question whether the machinery resulting from this Conference would be appropriate to undertake: *(a)* any of the country examinations, *(b)* and/or the co-ordination ot such examinations should be taken up at a later stage in the light of decisions at this Conference.  </sup>   
###II

*The Conference further recommends* that: 

3. The import capacity resulting from the combined total of export proceeds, invisible earnings and capital inflow available to the developing countries taking into account the evolution of prices should rise sufficiently, and the measures taken by the developing countries themselves should be adequate, to enable these higher rates of growth to be achieved. All countries, developed and developing, should undertake, individually and in co-operation, such measures as may be necessary to ensure this, and provision may be made for a periodic review of the measures so taken and the experience gained in the light of section I above.   
###III

*Believing* that each economically advanced country should make a sustained effort to assist the developing countries, *The Conference further recommends* that: 

4. Each economically advanced country should endeavour to supply, in the light of the principles of Annex A.IV.1 financial resources to the developing countries of a minimum net amount approaching as nearly as possible to 1 per cent of its national income, having regard, however, to the special position of certain countries which are net importers of capital. <sup> 1  The definition of financial resources is, in summary, as follows:   Official cash grants and grants in kind (including grants for technical assistance); sales of commodities against local currencies; government lending for periods exceeding one year (net of repayments of principal); grants and capital subscriptions to multilateral aid agencies, and net purchases of bonds, loans and participations from those agencies.   Private capital on the basis of net long-term movements, originating with residents of the capital-exporting countries. They are thus net of repatriation of principal, disinvestment, and retirement of long-term loans, portfolio assets and commercial debt. They are not net of reverse flows of capital originating with residents of the less-developed countries, nor of investment income.  </sup>  

5. This is not intended to represent either a ceiling or a suitable method for comparing the appropriate quantitative or qualitative development assistance efforts as between different economically advanced countries.     

### Annex  A.IV.3  

####Aims of international financial and technical co-operation

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 89 votes to 1, with 26 abstentions.  </sup>   *The Conference considers* that: 

*a.* Financial and technical co-operation by developed countries with developing countries through both bilateral and multilateral programmes, should be aimed at strengthening the economic and political independence of developing countries;  

*b.* Financial and technical assistance to developing countries by developed countries and international organizations should supplement and facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to ensure the steady and uninterrupted growth of their national economy through industrialization, the development of agriculture and the diversification of production and foreign trade;  

*c.* Such assistance should not be subject to any political, economic, military or other conditions unacceptable to the developing countries;   *The Conference recommends* that, in granting loans to developing countries, developed countries should aim at the following: 

1. The interest rate on State loans should not normally exceed 3 per cent annually, and steps should be taken to ensure that loans to developing countries by international organizations are granted on favourable terms;  

2. Funds received in repayment of loans made to developing countries should be used to the extent possible for the purchase of goods produced in those countries, particularly in undertakings financed by such loans.

*Considering* the difficulties generally experienced in present arrangements and which may arise in aid programmes of government to government transfer of capital through loans and in the availability of suppliers' credit to developing countries from industrialized countries owing, *inter alia,* to short periods of repayment, high rates of interest, limitations on tying of credits to specific projects and to purchases from the countries providing the capital, *Agreeing* that these stipulations and conditions can produce a serious strain on the balance of payments of developing countries and often cause delay and difficulty in the implementation of projects, *Aware* that recent studies of the present and prospective external debt situation of the developing countries have drawn attention to the difficulties for a number of these countries in meeting debt service payments, *Hopeful* that efforts will continue to be made to give greater continuity to bilateral aid programmes, *Mindful* that, as a prerequisite, developing countries should have properly drawn development plans, with targets and time limits covering all aspects of their economy, and an adequate portfolio of projects, that they should develop adequate national credit and financing institutions and appropriate machineries for processing loans and financial assistance, and that they should ensure an implementation machinery, *The Conference recommends* that donor countries, in framing their policies, should endeavour to meet the following objectives to secure more meaningful and progressive financial co-operation with developing countries and ensure greater efficiency in aid programmes: 
### *I. Repayment of loans* 

1. Some part of repayment of loans may be accepted in national currencies of the debtor countries, either through bilateral or regional arrangements, through payments' unions, credit insurance arrangements or other appropriate measures;  

2. Repayments should be spread over a considerably long period which should normally be not less than twenty years, and with a certain grace period, taking into account the specific nature of goods. Existing loans should, where necessary, be mutually re-studied and revised with a view to consolidation and re-negotiation, where the economic condition of a recipient country so justifies it;  

3. As far as possible, aid should be a blend of grant and loans. Interest rates for development loans should take into account the repayment capacity of the borrowing country. Endeavour should be made that they should not normally exceed 3 per cent and, where this is not feasible, waivers of interest should be considered to meet this objective. In cases where necessary and justified, wherever they are in excess of this figure, they should be re-negotiated to bring them down to a reasonable level.  

4. Inasmuch as aid and trade should be co-ordinated, and where loans are repayable in convertible currencies and are tied to purchases in donor countries, ways and means should be devised both in centrally planned economies, where some such arrangements already exist, and in free market economies, for the repayment of such loans in mutually determined commodities and manufactures produced by the debtor country. For this purpose, it is suggested that an expert group of industrialized and developing countries should be constituted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to work out the mechanism of such procedures or devise means to mitigate the difficulties of developing countries in this regard. Arrangements for deliveries on credit of capital equipment on conditions of repayment from resultant production or through goods produced by recipient countries could also be considered in appropriate cases and under suitable conditions;   
### *II. Utilization of loans* 

5. As far as possible, development loans should not be tied to particular projects and, where this becomes unavoidable, for reasons of over-all managerial and technical assistance or bilateral association in some specific cases or due to special credit terms or acute balance-of-payment difficulties in donor countries, necessary care should be taken that loans for infra-structure and social schemes such as education, public health and community development should nonetheless be of a particularly soft nature;  

6. Loans for purchase of capital equipment or non-project assistance should not ordinarily be tied to purchases in donor countries and, keeping in view the desirability of flexibility to developing countries in their procurement policies, should be available for use in best markets and particularly in the markets of recipient and other developing countries. In any case, they should be available for purchases in countries with convertible currencies. Moreover, in all cases of tied loans, where the recipient country can show that the required equipment and goods are available at cheaper rates or better terms elsewhere, either the governments should intervene to bring down prices and regulate conditions of supply or, where this is not feasible, to transfer the funds for other purchases in donor countries at competitive rates or, failing that, to release them for free purchase in the best market from the point of view of the recipient country;  

7. Where development loans are unavoidably tied to projects, regard should be had to the fact that some developing countries are not always able to provide the counterpart local currency requirements for implementation of a project and that a number of projects give rise to additional indirect foreign exchange requirements. In such cases, the loans should be devised directly or indirectly to cover substantially more than the foreign exchange component of the project;   
### *III. Removal of restrictions* 

8. Recipient countries should not be compelled to use the shipping of a lending country for the transportation of goods purchased under loan and aid advanced by that country;  

9. Recipient countries should not be compelled to insure goods purchased under loan and aid advanced by a donor country with the insurance companies of that country;   
### *IV. Appraisal procedures* 

10. Appraisal procedures for assessing requests for loans, both for general plans or specific projects, should be simplified to the greatest possible extent and the present arrangements, which tend to be dilatory, should be studied by donor and recipient countries so that they should be improved with a view to simplification and expedition, while ensuring proper examination;   
### *V. Co-ordination of aid and of aid and trade* 

11. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in the light of its experience in relation to countries for which there are consortia and consultative groups, or other appropriate bodies under the aegis of the United Nations, should be encouraged, at the request of developing countries concerned, and where appropriate, to co-ordinate aid in respect of individual countries or groups of countries through consortia or regional or other suitable institutions where they exist. These bodies should at suitable regular intervals review the implementation of the above recommendations with a view to persuading all countries concerned to securing the full achievement of the above guiding lines and objectives, in particular the establishment of more consistent terms and conditions and joint action with a view to liberalizing procurement procedures;  

12. To ensure better co-ordination between trade and aid, it is recommended that governments of both aid-giving and aid-receiving countries should have at their disposal adequate co-ordination machinery for arriving at mutually consistent and constructive decisions and adequate information on which to base policy decisions concerning the issues. For this purpose, studies and surveys evaluating progress in adapting aid to trade needs should be periodically made;  

13. Provision of technical assistance and training facilities along with capital aid should be tailored to promote co-ordination of aid to combine public financing with the provision of the necessary skills so as to enable the recipients to obtain the best results from the goods purchased by them.     

### Annex  A.IV.5  

####Problem of debt service in developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 109 votes to none, with 11 abstentions.  </sup>   *Taking note* of the problem of servicing of external debt for many developing countries and keeping in view their external capital requirements in future, the *Conference recommends* that: 

1. Competent United Nations bodies and/or other international financial institutions should stand ready, at the request of any developing country, to review, in co-operation with the creditor countries concerned, the external indebtedness of the developing country concerned, where appropriate, with a view to securing agreement, if necessary, on the re-scheduling or consolidation of debt, with appropriate periods of grace and amortization and reasonable rates of interest;  

2. In this connexion, debtor countries should take all possible measures to bring their balance of payments under control and to meet their obligations as they fall due;  

3. The international financial agencies should consider the possibilities of adapting their organizations and procedures with a view to improving the terms of their transactions, keeping in view the particular problems of developing countries;  

4. The resources available to the International Development Association should be enlarged to provide assistance to developing countries on terms with a minimal burden of debt service. For this purpose, possibilities should be explored of: 

*a.* Transfer to the International Development Association of a reasonable portion of the net earnings of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at the end of each fiscal year;  

*b.* Contributions on a continuing basis to the resources of the International Development Association by the member governments to the maximum extent possible.

*The Conference recommends* that, in establishing new production units in developing countries owned by them from the outset, credit arrangements for the financing of capital equipment and technical co-operation could be based on the concept of remuneration by means of goods produced by the unit concerned or in other products of developing countries as appropriate. It is understood that the prices of the delivered capital equipment, as well as the prices of the products to be reimbursed, should be settled at world market prices for similar capital equipment and products. The products to be reimbursed should not be re-exported unless with the consent of the parties to the agreement. The delivered capital equipment should correspond to the technical level of similar capital equipment in international trade.

While noting the hopeful initiatives that have been proposed for extending the scope of the United Nations activity in development finance, 

1. *The Conference recommends* that the United Nations Capital Development Fund should start its operations at an early date to finance on favourable terms in all developing countries, especially in countries at an earlier stage of development, national and regional development plans, programmes and projects, particularly in the field of industrialization.  

2. The resources of the United Nations Capital Development Fund should be derived from voluntary contributions.

*Referring* to the note by the Secretary-General of the United Nations entitled “Transformation of the Special Fund into a United Nations Capital Development Fund: A study of the practical steps involved”, <sup> 1  E/CONF.46/66 and Corr. 1.  </sup> *Considering* the objective of channelling more development assistance through the framework of the United Nations, *Considering* that if and when a merger between the expanded Programme of Technical Assistance and the Special Fund is decided, such a merger may result in: 

*a.* Increased total resources being made available for development purposes;  

*b.* Greater administrative efficiency and better utilization of resources,   *Believing* that it would be appropriate to consider an extension of the terms of reference of the Special Fund into the field of investment proper in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1936 (XVIII), 

1. *The Conference recommends* to the Governing Council of the Special Fund that it continue to give consideration to: 

*a.* Enlarging its activities in assisting governments - which so request - to find the necessary financing to implement the recommendations of Special Fund preinvestment surveys; and  

*b.* Broadening its criteria so as to include increased financing of demonstration projects, thereby playing an effective role as a bridge between pre-investment and capital investment;    

2. *The Conference recommends* to the Governments participating in the Conference to take, in the light of paragraph 1 above, a constructive attitude to a gradual transformation of the United Nations Special Fund, so as to include not only pre-investment but also investment proper, as referred to in General Assembly resolutions 1219 (XII), section III and 1936 (XVIII), as additional resources become available;  

3. *The Conference recommends* that the Fund should be authorized to accept additional contributions for the purpose of following up its pre-investment activities, provided that the Governing Council of the Special Fund is satisfied that such expenditure for this purpose will not unfavourably affect Special Fund financing of pre-investment needs;  

4. *The Conference also recommends* that particular emphasis be placed on (a) the channelling of any investment resources, which the Special Fund may have at its disposal as a result of action taken in conformity with paragraphs 2 and 3 above, to areas not adequately covered by other capital supplying facilities; and (b) ensuring that action taken under these paragraphs would not unfavourably affect Special Fund financing of pre-investment needs.

*Realizing* that the sustained development in the developing countries is not possible from the indigenous resources alone of these countries. *Recognizing* that present forms of aid to developing countries are inadequate in scale, scope and consistency to meet the long-term needs of the developing countries, *Taking note* of the aid being given to developing countries by many of the developed countries, *The Conference requests* the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to convene a committee of experts: 

1. To study in consultation with the appropriate agencies operating in the same field: 

*a.* The feasibility of establishing a fund, where appropriate, for aid to developing countries for the purpose of financing long-term capital projects with particular emphasis on regional and/or sub-regional development projects, without prejudice to bilateral arrangements;  

*b.* The possibility of utilizing suitable regional agencies engaged in development financing in the operating of such a fund;    

2. To work out if found necessary a suitable scheme on the lines of the study proposed in paragraph 1 above;  

3. To report to the General Assembly at its twentieth session or earlier.     

### Annex  A.IV.10  

####Regional development

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *Believing* that development on a regional basis can be of material help in enabling developing countries to obtain the benefits of economies of scale for efficient production, marketing, research and trade generally, 

1. *The Conference urges* that a proportion of assistance be provided to developing countries, where possible and appropriate, through or in association with regional bodies such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the African Development Bank;  

2. *The Conference recommends* that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in consultation with the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, regional economic commissions, regional development banks and other appropriate regional bodies, be asked to study the problems of regional development and report to the General Assembly of the United Nations at its twentieth session.

####Scheme for increasing capital flows to developing countries through an interest equalization fund

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 97 votes to none, with 12 abstentions.  </sup>   

1. *The Conference,* after having considered and discussed the proposal by Israel for financing economic development, *expresses its strong interest* in this proposal; <sup> 1  E/CONF.46/C.3/2 and C.3/L.5/Rev.1.  </sup>  

2. *The Conference recommends* that a further study be made by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development covering all aspects of the proposal, taking into account the points and observations made during the discussion in the Third Committee;  

3. *The Conference requests* the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to submit the aforementioned study, if possible by September 1964, to the United Nations.     

### Annex  A.IV.l2  

####Promotion of private foreign investment in developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 94 votes to 1, with 22 abstentions.  </sup>   *Recalling* that the United Nations General Assembly, by its resolution 1710(XVI) designating the 1960's as the “United Nations Development Decade”, called upon its Member States: 

“To adopt measures which will stimulate the flow of private investment capital for the economic development of the developing countries, on terms that are satisfactory both to the capital-exporting countries and the capital-importing countries”,   *Aware* that, since the beginning of the Decade, the flow of private capital to developing countries, instead of increasing, has substantially declined, *Recognizing* the contribution of direct private foreign investment to the economic diversification of private capital importing developing countries, *Agreeing* that the supply of sustained and substantial international public aid contributes to the opening up of opportunities of investment and the generation of a favourable climate for the flow of international private capital to such countries. *Aware* that foreign private investment brings technical know-how and managerial skill, *The Conference recommends* the following sets of measures and actions in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1710(XVI): 
### *A. Action by governments of developed countries and international institutions to promote the flow of private capital to developing countries* 

1. The governments of capital exporting developed countries should avoid measures preventing or limiting the flow of capital from such countries to developing countries and should take all appropriate steps to encourage the flow of private investments to developing countries, such as tax exemption or reductions and giving investment guarantees to private investors investing in developing countries and by facilitating the training of managerial and technical staff;  

2. The International Finance Corporation should examine the possibility of expanding its investment activities, including the use of its borrowing power, under Article III, section 6 (i) of its Articles of Agreement;   
### *B. Action by developing countries* 

3. *The Conference recommends* to the private capital-importing developing countries to take all appropriate steps to provide favourable conditions for direct private investment. The Conference further recommends to developing countries to set up investment bureaux and investment advisory services and to establish and strengthen credit institutions and development banks and to determine and publicize the areas of investment, manner of investment and investment policy;   
### *C. Provision of information on investment opportunities* 

*The Conference*  

4. *Recommends* to the developing countries, in co-operation with appropriate bodies of the United Nations and the governments and suitable organizations such as federations and chambers of commerce and industries in the industrialized countries to endeavour to establish information centres in capital markets and adopt other suitable means to supply all the necessary information about investment conditions, regulations and opportunities in the developing countries;  

5. *Requests* appropriate bodies of the United Nations and governments of developed countries to consider assisting the developing countries on their request through financial and technical assistance in establishing local agencies with a view to enabling these agencies; 

*a.* To provide to private investors both domestic and foreign, information on foreign sources of finance;  

*b.* To furnish to private investors, both domestic and foreign, full information as regards the areas of industrial activity open to foreign enterprise and the fiscal and other facilities and incentives and to give all the assistance necessary for the pre-investment and preliminary planning activities, and preparation and presentation of projects reports and feasibility studies;  

*c.* To keep ready and make available feasibility reports and a portfolio of projects and fields of investment for consideration and use of private investors;     
### *D. Action by investors* 

6. *The Conference recommends* that foreign private investment, based upon respect for the sovereignty of the host country, should co-operate with local initiative and capital, rely as far as possible on existing resources in developing countries and should work within the framework and objectives of the development plans with a view to supplying domestic markets and in particular expanding exports. The Conference expects that foreign private investment will recognize the desirability of re-investment of profits in the developing countries concerned as far as possible, availability of know-how to nationals of developing countries and training and employment opportunities to nations of host countries and other corresponding measures;   
### *E. Studies* 

7. *The Conference requests* the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to expedite its studies on investment insurance in consultation with governments in both developing and developed countries and submit, by September 1965 at the latest, the result of its studies and consultations to the United Nations;  

8. The Conference understands that the International Bank is examining the question of the establishment of machinery for settlement of investment disputes. *The Conference requests* the International Bank to submit the result of its studies and consultations to the United Nations;  

9. *The Conference invites* the International Bank to include in its studies the problem of guarantees to the securities that the private enterprise or public institutions of a developing country may wish to float in the capital markets of the developed countries;  

10. *The Conference requests* the Secretary-General of the United Nations to arrange full further studies in consultation with all concerned as may be required to cover all aspects of foreign private investment in order to enable the fulfilment of the objective embodied in the resolution of the General Assembly referred to in the preamble to this recommendation, keeping in view the recommended measures and actions above.     

### Annex  A.IV.13  

####Needs of the public sector in the transfer of external resources to developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 117 votes to 1, with 1 abstention.  </sup>    *The Conference*  

1. *Recognizes* that the public sector in developing countries plays a significant role in the economic structure of these countries;  

2. *Is aware* that the public sector in developing countries can contribute to accelerating the diversification of their economy, through the industrialization and agricultural development leading to the promotion of the exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures;  

3. *Expresses the view* that the participation of the public sector should be envisaged within the framework of the economic development plans of developing countries;  

4. *Recommends* the following principles: 

I. Governments of developed countries should take appropriate account of the needs of the public sector in developing countries, in particular: 

*a.* by not discriminating between enterprises of the public sector and private enterprises, with regard to the financial and commercial treatment;  

*b.* by giving technical assistance to enterprises and institutions of the public sector of developing countries on an equal basis to that granted to the private sector;  

*c.* by creating for their enterprises favourable conditions for industrial and agricultural co-operation with enterprises of the public sector of developing countries, in matters relating to licences, purchase of spare parts, semi-manufactures, intermediate products etc. from the developing countries and to other forms of joint efforts resulting in industrial and trade progress in developing countries;    

II. International institutions, agencies, bodies, etc., and in particular financial institutions, should endeavour to assist without discrimination the public sector of developing countries in accordance with the development plans of these countries.       

### Annex  A.IV.14  

####Suppliers' credits and credit insurance in developed and developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *Having in mind* the number and importance of the questions relating to credit and credit insurance which have raised both by developing and developed countries and the variety of proposals put forward for action in this field, *The Conference recommends* that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development should be invited: 

1. To make a study of the use (actual and potential) and terms of suppliers' credits and credit insurance, including rediscounting arrangements: 

*a.* For financing exports from developed to developing countries, taking account of the capacity of the latter to repay and of other effects on their economies and balances of payments;  

*b.* As regards their effects on competition between the exports of developing and developed countries as well as between the developed countries;  

*c.* As a means of financing trade between the developing countries.    

2. To take account, in so doing, of the relevant observations, recommendations and suggestions submitted to the Conference, including those in the draft recommendation by Spain and Tunisia annexed hereto;  

3. To identify the difficulties which arise or may arise, in particular as regards debt service, and to consider possible solutions;  

4. To submit the study to the United Nations at the earliest possible date together with any appropriate recommendations.     

### APPENDIX  

####Text of the draft recommendation proposed by Spain and Tunisia (E/CONF.46/C.3/L.34/Rev.1)

<sup> 1  This recommendation was submitted to the Third Committee by Spain and Tunisia, but no vote was taken on it. Paragraph 4 (a) was slightly amended by the addition of the words “promote and expand”.  </sup>  

### I  

With a view to adapting supplier credit to the circumstances and requirements of the developing countries, *the Conference recommends* that: 

1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development should study the establishment of a multilateral inter-governmental credit insurance institution, taking into account the practice and experience of the national credit insurance systems operating in certain developed countries;  

2. The object of the institution should be to cover risks incurred in respect of supplier credit, by guaranteeing insurance and re-insurance for the supplier granting credit;  

3. The institution should also, insofar as possible, be prepared to extend its financial assistance beyond the coverage of the risks referred to in paragraph 2 above, with a view to reducing the costs incurred by the developing countries for the use of supplier credits;  

4. The developed countries should furnish the developing countries with the most extensive technical assistance possible in regard to exports, in order to help those countries: 

*a.* To establish, promote and expand, at the national or regional level, credit insurance organizations to promote external trade through guarantees designed to reduce risks, especially the credit risks which such trade involves;  

*b.* To set up or improve their machinery for financing exports (external trade banks, rediscounting institutions, etc.).      

### II  

*Considering* that one of the most effective forms of assistance is the promotion of exports, especially of manufactures and semi-manufactures, from developing countries, *Considering* that in order to export such goods, those countries not only have to meet competitive qualities and prices, but also have to offer terms of sale (deferred payment, credit to purchasers, etc.) similar to those offered by industrialized countries - which is often beyond their means, 
### *The Conference recommends* 

5. That existing international finance organizations undertake the study of the measures to be taken to enable developing countries to gain access to world markets on credit terms comparable to those of industrialized countries;  

6. That, to that end, the possibility should be studied of enabling commercial drafts relating to export operations of developing countries, duly endorsed by the central bank or by any body offering adequate safeguards, to be rediscounted at a reasonable interest rate.    

### Annex  A.IV.15

*The Conference expresses interest* in the proposal of Senegal on the establishment of an ‘interest rebate fund” for the purpose of reducing by compensatory payments the rate of interest on loans and credits which are of primary economic importance for the expansion of the developing countries; <sup> 1  E/CONF.46/C.3/L.14.  </sup> *The Conference recommends* that the proposal be studied by an international agency to be designated by the United Nations Secretariat;  *The Conference requests that the study:*  

*a.* Should take into account the comments and observations to which the proposal has given rise in the Third Committee;  

*b.* Should be submitted to the United Nations as soon as possible.     

### Annex  A.IV.16  

####Scheme for investigating the financing of marketing of primary products from developing countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 102 votes to none, with 13 abstentions.  </sup>   *Taking into account* that it is advisable to study the improvement of existing trade practices and systems in the developing countries with particular reference to the financing of external marketing of main primary products and raw materials, with a view to ensuring that producing countries share equitably in the final prices paid for their main export products, *The Conference recommends* the organ that may be set up as a result of this Conference, in consultation with the appropriate international organizations, to undertake a study of the systems of financing the export marketing of main primary commodities in order to reveal the factors determining the share of the producing countries in the final prices paid for those products in the developed countries.   

### Annex  A.IV.17  

####Study of measures related to the compensatory credit system of the International Monetary Fund

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *Considering* that the compensatory credit system put into operation by the International Monetary Fund since February 1963 constitutes a definite step towards the solution of short term financing problems, *Considering* that, in view of the short term needs of developing countries derived from fluctuations in their export receipts, this system should be reviewed, 

1. *The Conference recommends* that Governments members of the International Monetary Fund study the following measures: 

(1) To increase, as soon as possible, the amount allocated by the Fund to compensatory financing over and above its current transactions, from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of a member country's quota;  

(2) To place compensatory credits entirely outside the structure of the gold and successive credit tranches, so that the drawing of compensatory credits would not directly or indirectly prejudice a member's ability to make an ordinary drawing;  

(3) To explore ways to secure possible refinancing of compensatory financing obligations of the developing countries in the event of a persistent shortfall in export receipts beyond the control of the affected country.    

2. The Conference requests that the International Monetary Fund, in its determination of the shortfall in export receipts, consider giving greater weight to the actual experience of the three preceding years.     

### Annex  A.IV.18  

####Supplementary financial measures

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation by 106 votes to none, with 10 abstentions.  </sup>  

### A  

*Recognizing* that adverse movements in the export proceeds of developing countries can be disruptive of development, and *noting* that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can make available balance of payments support to help meet the short-term effects of shortfalls in export proceeds, *the Conference recommends* that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development be invited to study the feasibility of a scheme with the objective set forth in section I below and based on the principles set forth in section II below, and, if appropriate, to work out such a scheme. 
### *I. Objective* 

1. The new scheme should aim to deal with problems arising from adverse movements in export proceeds which prove to be of a nature or duration which cannot adequately be dealt with by short-term balance of payments support. Its purpose should be to provide longer term assistance to developing countries which would help them to avoid disruption of their development programmes.   
### *II. Principles* 

2 The scheme should be provided with resources by contributions from participating countries shared between them on an equitable basis.  

3. Developing countries only should be eligible for assistance from the scheme; such assistance should be on concessional and flexible terms.  

4. The scheme should normally be applicable after a developing country had had recourse to the International Monetary Fund under its compensatory financing facility and it had been possible to make a full assessment of the nature, duration and implications of any adverse movement in the export proceeds of the developing country concerned.  

5. An adverse movement for the purposes of the scheme should be regarded as a shortfall from reasonable expectations (see Note 1 below) of the level of export proceeds (including in appropriate cases invisible exports).  

6. *A prima facie* case for assistance from the scheme should be established by reference to shortfalls from reasonable expectations and to the nature and duration of such shortfalls (see Note 2).  

7. Once a *prima facie* case has been established there should be an examination, under the International Development Association, of all relevant economic circumstances (see Note 3) in order to assess how far assistance from the scheme would be required and justified in order to help avoid disruption of development programmes. Subject to these points assistance could cover a substantial proportion of a shortfall from reasonable expectations.  

8. Resources for the scheme, which would be administered under the International Development Association, should be in the form of additional commitments, prescribed in advance, for contributions to the Association; all the major Part I member countries of the Association should contribute.   
### *Notes* 

NOTE 1 To the extent that these could be prescribed in advance they could be taken account of by developing countries for planning purpose. NOTE 2 The following are offered as illustrative circumstances which might constitute a *prima facie* case for assistance from the scheme to a developing country: 

(i) If following an IMF drawing in one year under its special compensatory financing facility, exports fall significantly below reasonable expectations in the second or third year.  

(ii) If when IMF drawings were due to be repaid exports had not recovered sufficiently for this to be possible without disruption of development,  

(iii) If there were a significant shortfall in exports which the IMF adjudged at the outset to be other than of a short-term nature and the IMF had decided that it would be inappropriate for it to provide temporary balance of payments support.   NOTE 3 Among other matters, these would include adverse effects from significant rises in import prices.  

### B  

*The Conference also recommends* that the continuing machinery recommended by this Conference be invited to study and organize further discussion of the following concepts and proposals for financing put forward by the delegations of the developing countries at the Conference: 

1. That a fund be set up, financed by contributions from developed countries as required and administered by an appropriate agency of the United Nations;  

2 That only developing countries should be eligible to draw from the Fund;  

3. That disbursements should be in the form of non-reimbursable transfers and/or contingent loans or concessional terms;  

4. That the criteria used in deciding upon claims should be as objective as possible and should include the following 

*a.* The effect of shortfalls in export earnings and the adverse movements in the terms of trade;  

*b.* The effect on the country's development programme;    

5. That to complement this longer term approach, facilities be provided for interim financing, when warranted, to assist the developing countries concerned while the longer term problem is being assessed.

It is necessary to make provision for adequate study of international monetary issues relating to problems of trade and development with special reference to the objectives and decisions of this Conference. Studies of the future of the international monetary system should not be carried out in isolation from the examination of new trade policies. It is necessary to ensure that any decisions reached on future organization of international monetary relationships should be made fully consistent with the purposes of the present Conference, and that any arrangements for the solution of the currency problems of the major trading countries should take fully into account the needs of developing nations. At the same time, new problems are raised in connexion with programmes for liberalizing trade among developing countries. Further study is needed of the possibility of payments arrangements for developing countries on both a regional and an extra-regional basis that might facilitate such liberalization. *The Conference recommends* that: 

1. The Secretary-General of the Conference take, in the light of the studies under way and after consultation with the appropriate international institutions, steps to convene a group of experts with a knowledge and experience of the problems of developing countries and industrialized countries to consider the international monetary issues relating to problems of trade and development with special reference to the objectives and decisions of this Conference, and devoting particular attention to the needs of the developing countries in their trade with one another and the rest of the world;  

2. Governments participating in the Conference should be invited to submit any reports or observations they would consider to be of relevance to the work of the group;  

3. The group should consult with the International Monetary Fund and other international and regional financial and monetary institutions;  

4. The findings of the group should be transmitted to the first meeting of the Trade and Development Board of the Conference, or its equivalent, as well as to the General Assembly of the United Nations and to the international and regional monetary organizations.

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   *The Conference recommends* that appropriate inter-governmental procedures, including any committee that might be deemed necessary, be established under the United Nations system or as part of the institutional system that might be set up under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to promote understanding and co-operation in the field of shipping, and to study and report on economic aspects of shipping that might be referred to it.   

### Annex  A.IV.22  

####Common measure of understanding on shipping questions

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   

1. It was agreed that the liner conference system is necessary in order to secure stable rates and regular services. However, in order that the system may function properly it is necessary that there should be close co-operation between shippers and the conferences. As an initial step a well organized consultation machinery should be established with adequate procedures for hearing and remedying complaints by the formation of shippers' councils or other suitable bodies on a national and regional basis. It was noted that action has already been taken in some countries on these lines and that the experience thus gained would offer a useful model for other countries to consider. The following matters which may need consideration could be raised within such machinery: 

*a.* Publication by Conferences of their tariffs and regulations.  

*b.* Increases in conference freight rates, levy of surcharges, etc., giving of reasonable advance notice in this regard.  

*c.* The terms of dual rate and deferred rebate agreements.  

*d.* Effective representation of conferences in major ports of developing countries where appropriate.  

*e.* The adequacy of shipping services in the trades concerned.  

*f.* Action to be undertaken in order to improve and promote exports of developing countries and in particular intra-regional trade.  

*g.* Rationalization of routes and freights, established or to be established in accordance with the national characteristics of production, marketing and development requirements.    

2. The costs of inland transportation and the cargo handling costs in ports (including the cost of ships' time spent in port) in many cases represent a substantial percentage of total transportation costs of international shipments. There are possibilities of reducing the total cost of transportation by improving port facilities and in the establishment of new facilities. All countries should therefore give priority to improvement of port operation and of connected inland transportation facilities. Greater efforts should be made in providing for the aforesaid purposes and to this end international financing and aid and technical assistance be made available on favourable terms and conditions.  

3. It was considered that the development of merchant marines in developing countries as well as their participation in liner conferences as full members on equitable terms is to be welcomed. The question of development of merchant marines by developing countries should be decided by such countries on the basis of sound economic criteria.  

4. While accepting the above common measure of understanding, the sponsor and supporters of the draft recommendation by Sweden (E/CONF.46/C.3/L.29) declared that they maintained their views as expressed in the aforesaid document and reserved their rights. The supporters were: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. <sup> 1  For reservations or explanations made by the representatives of Greece, Spain, United States of America and Australia, respectively, see report of the Working Party on Shipping annexed to the report of the Third Committee (E/CONF.46/133, Annex B, paragraphs 52 to 55).  </sup> <sup> 1  For reservations or explanations made by the representatives of Greece, Spain, United States of America and Australia, respectively, see report of the Working Party on Shipping annexed to the report of the Third Committee (E/CONF.46/133, Annex B, paragraphs 52 to 55).  </sup> <sup> 1  For reservations or explanations made by the representatives of Greece, Spain, United States of America and Australia, respectively, see report of the Working Party on Shipping annexed to the report of the Third Committee (E/CONF.46/133, Annex B, paragraphs 52 to 55).  </sup>

*Considering* that the characteristics of insurance and reinsurance activities, in general, require operation on an international basis, That it is necessary to make this international character compatible with the economic and financial interests of the developing countries, That a sound national insurance and reinsurance market is an essential characteristic of economic growth, That it is desirable to pool the technical surpluses retained nationally by developing countries and to redistribute them on a regional basis before they are returned to traditional reinsurance markets, *The Conference recommends* that: 

1. The developed countries should give their full co-operation to the developing countries to encourage and strengthen their national insurance and reinsurance markets and should give their support to all reasonable measures which are directed to this endeavour and to the increase of their retention capacity.  

2. Developed countries should continue and increase the technical assistance and training facilities which they provide and which are required for the sound development of national insurance and reinsurance markets in developing countries.  

3. 
*a.* Technical reserves and guarantee deposits of insurance and reinsurance companies or institutions should be invested in the country where the premium income arises.  

*b.* Adequate conditions of security, liquidity and income must however be assured.  

*c.* Developed countries should encourage such investment by removing all obstacles to the achievement of this aim.    

4. Developing countries in which national insurance markets are sufficiently well established, after carrying out technical and financial studies, should establish regional reinsurance institutions.  

5. Developed countries which provide aid to developing countries should not prescribe conditions limiting the rights of the developing countries to require insurance to be placed in the national market.  

6. The competent international organizations should examine the question of the adoption of: 

*a.* uniform clauses for marine, land and air transport insurance;  

*b.* uniform criteria for the compilation of insurance and reinsurance statistics.

####Preparation of a convention relating to the transit trade of land-locked countries

<sup> *  The Conference adopted this Recommendation without dissent.  </sup>   THE CONFERENCE *Having regard* to the various aspects of the problem of transit trade of landlocked States, *Noting* resolution 1028 (XI) on the subject adopted by the United Nations General Assembly which recognized “...the need of land-locked countries for adequate transit facilities in promoting international trade...” and invited the Governments of Member States “ ...to give full recognition to the needs of landlocked Member States in the matter of transit and trade and, therefore, to accord them adequate facilities in terms of international law and practice in this regard, bearing in mind the future requirements resulting from the economic development of the land-locked countries”, *Noting* the resolution of the ECAFE Ministerial Conference of 1963 on Asian Economic Co-operation, “Recognizing the right of free transit for land-locked countries and the special considerations which apply to their transport and transit problems and the importance of the relationship of these problems to questions of regional co-operation and the expansion of intra-regional trade;”, *Noting further* the ECAFE resolution 51 (XX) on the transit trade of land-locked countries, which strongly recommended that the subject be given urgent and sympathetic consideration at the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Trade and Development with a view to formulating an adequate and effective international convention to ensure the freedom of transit trade of land-locked countries, *Considering that,* for the promotion of the economic development of the land-locked States, it is essential to provide facilities to enable them to overcome the effects of their land-locked position on their trade, *Taking into consideration* that the existing multilateral conventions relating to the transit trade of the land-locked countries need to be brought up to date and it is therefore essential to formulate an adequate and effective international convention to ensure the freedom of transit trade of land-locked countries, *Recommends* that the United Nations

###JOINT DECLARATION OF THE SEVENTY-SEVEN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MADE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT

(Afghanistan, Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ceylon, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Leopoldville), Costa Rica, Cyprus, Dahomey, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti.

###I

1. The developing countries named above recognize the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as a significant step towards creating a new and just world economic order. They regard this Conference as the fruition of sustained efforts which found expression in the Cairo Declaration, the Alta Gracia Charter, the Resolutions of Brazilia, Addis Ababa, Niamey, Manilla and Teheran and, above all, in the Joint Declaration of the seventy-five countries made at theeighteenth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. These efforts helped to forge the unity of the seventy-five - the outstanding feature of the entire Conference and an event of historic significance.   
###II

2. The basic premises of the new order were enumerated in these earlier declarations and in the report of the Secretary-General of the Conference. In brief, they involve a new international division of labour oriented towards the accelerated industrialization of developing countries. The efforts of developing countries to raise the living standards of their peoples, which are now being made under adverse external conditions, should be supplemented and strengthened by constructive international action. Such action should establish a new framework of international trade that is wholly consistent with the needs of accelerated development.  

3. The several themes of a new and dynamic international policy for trade and development, including the question of transit trade of land-locked countries, found concrete expression in specific programmes and proposals presented by the developing countries to this Conference as a united expression of objectives and measures in all major fields. The developing countries consider it an achievement that this Conference has provided a basis for the fullest discussion of these programmes and proposals by the entire international community. They are confident that the deliberations of this Conference will be of assistance in the formulation of new policies by the Governments of both developed and developing countries in the context of a new awareness of the needs of developing countries.   
###Ill

4. The developing countries declare, however, that they consider the final recommendations of the Conference as only an initial step towards an international endorsement of a new trade policy for development. They do not consider that the progress that has been registered in each of the major fields of economic development has been adequate or commensurate with their essential requirements. There has not, for instance, been an adequate appreciation of the problem of the 'trade gap' of developing countries. Only the most limited approaches were made regarding trade in primary commodities, and of preferences for exports of manufactures. Similarly, only preliminary steps were possible relating to schemes for compensatory financing to meet long-term deterioration in the terms of trade. The developing countries have, nevertheless, accepted the results of this Conference in the hope that these results would lay the foundation for more substantial progress in the period ahead. They have also accepted these resolutions in recognition of the need for a co-operative effort in the international field. To this end they have chosen to arrive at the widest measure of agreements possible, rather than to register their aspirations by majority decisions.   
###IV

5. The developing countries attach singular importance to the establishment of international machinery in the field of trade and development. It is vitally necessary that this new machinery should be an effective instrument for the discussion of issues, the formulation of policies, the review of results and for taking such operational measures as are needed in the sphere of international economic relations.  

6. The developing countries recognize the value of the general agreement attained regarding the establishment of continuing machinery. They note that some important issues pertaining to such machinery have been held over for decision by the General Assembly. In this connexion it is their view that there should be ample scope for reaching workable agreement on substantial issues. But they categorically declare that no arrangements designed for this purpose should derogate from the ultimate right of the proposed Board and the Conference to adopt recommendations on any point of substance by a simple majority vote in the case of the Board and two-thirds majority vote in the case of the Conference. The developing countries attach cardinal importance to democratic procedures which afford no position of privilege in the economic and financial, no less than in the political sphere. Furthermore, the developing countries would stress the need for continued evolution in the institutional field leading not merely to the progressive strengthening of the machinery that is now contemplated, but also to the ultimate emergence of a comprehensive international trade organization.   
###V

7. The developing countries regard their own unity, the unity of the seventyfive, as the outstanding feature of this Conference. This unity has sprung out of the fact that facing the basic problems of development they have a common interest in a new policy for international trade and development. They believe that it is this unity that has given clarity and coherence to the discussions of this Conference. Their solidarity has been tested in the course of the Conference and they have emerged from it with even greater unity and strength.  

8. The developing countries have a strong conviction that there is a vital need to maintain and further strengthen this unity in the years ahead. It is an indispensable instrument for securing the adoption of new attitudes and new approaches in the international economic field. This unity is also an instrument for enlarging the area of co-operative endeavour in the international field and for securing mutually beneficient relationships with the rest of the world. Finally, it is a necessary means for co-operation amongst the developing countries themselves.  

9. The seventy-five developing countries, on the occasion of this declaration, pledge themselves to maintain, foster and strengthen this unity in the future. Towards this end they shall adopt all possible means to increase the contacts and consultations amongst themselves so as to determine common objectives and formulate joint programmes of action in international economic co-operation. They consider that measures for consolidating the unity achieved by the seventy-five countries during the Conference and the specific arrangements for contacts and consultations should be studied by Government representatives during the Nineteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.   
###VI

10. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development marks the beginning of a new era in the evolution of international co-operation in the field of trade and development. Such co-operation must serve as a decisive instrument for ending the division of the world into areas of affluence and intolerable poverty. This task is the outstanding challenge of our times. The injustice and neglect of centuries need to be redressed. The developing countries are united in their resolve to continue the quest for such redress and look to the entire international community for understanding and support in this endeavour.   
### *BULGARIA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUNGARY, POLAND AND THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS* 

RESERVATIONS OF THE DELEGATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WHICH SUBMITTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANIZATION , OR WHICH SUPPORT THE IDEA OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION, AS SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENT BY THE CZECHOSLOVAK DELEGATION AT THE PLENARY MEETING ON 15 JUNE 1964 <sup> 1  E/CONF.46/50 and Rev.1.  </sup> In connexion with the adoption by the Conference of the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 on institutional arrangements, the delegations of the socialist countries, which submitted the proposal for, and support the idea of, the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization deem it necessary to present the following observations. Paragraphs 1, 30 and 31 of the above-mentioned Recommendation do not reflect the substance of the proposals and statements made during the discussion of institutional arrangements at the Conference. The discussion of this matter ghowed that the majority of those participating in the Conference clearly favoured the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization as an instrument designed to ensure the necessary development of international trade in the interests of all countries and especially the developing countries. The proposal for the establishment of an international trade organization is set forth, in particular, in documents E/CONF.46/50 and Rev.1, E/CONF.46/C. 4/L.3 and E/CONF.46/C.4/L.5, and in the Fourth Committee recommendation (E/CONF.46/C.4/L.12/Rev.1) which was adopted by a very large majority of the Committee. The above countries are still firmly of the opinion that it is absolutely essential to carry out the proposal for the establishment of a universal international trade organization, which would be truly capable of promoting the removal of various kinds of obstacles and discrimination in international trade. In particular, the socialist countries, now as before, consider that a universal international trade organization and the provisional body set up for a transitional period should concern themselves with all the problems of international trade, including, in particular, the promotion of east-west trade and the removal of obstacles to such trade. If the organization is to be in a position to carry out these important tasks, it must be open to all countries participating in world trade and wishing to contribute to the success of the organization. Most delegations attending the Conference are fully aware that not one of the existing international institutions is able or fitted to handle all the problems of trade and development. It is imperative to overcome the present organizational confusion and correct the existing unsatisfactory international trade situation, thereby promoting the aims and purposes of the United Nations Charter in this sphere. In the course of the Conference, the socialist countries have sought the closest and most comprehensive co-operation with other countries, especially the developing countries as a whole. They have co-operated with the developing countries in the preparation of specific proposals on a number of questions, including, in particular, institutional questions. They agreed with them to vote for the last draft proposals on institutional arrangements (E/CONF.46/C.4/L.12/Rev.1) and gave that draft priority in the order of voting. The result was that, by an overwhelming majority, the Fourth Committee of the Conference adopted a satisfactory decision on institutional arrangements. That decision, however, was modified by the action of western countries which did not agree with it. A text considerably weaker in practical content was consequently placed before the Conference. Many countries will, we feel, regret that the more satisfactory text of the Fourth Committee was not adopted in plenary session. Nevertheless, desiring to see the Conference end in unanimity and agreement, the socialist countries decided not to oppose document E/CONF.46/L.22 (subsequently adopted as Recommendation A.V.1), although aware of its weakness. We are convinced that all countries will realize the need of truly radical measures for the normalization of international trade and the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization to that end. We shall continue to work for the speedy accomplishment of this purpose.

The Australian delegation voted in favour of the proposal for studies as to the feasibility of supplementary finance provided for in the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18. In recording that vote it wishes to have noted that it has reservations about the desirability of financial measures as a method of dealing with long-term short falls in export receipts. In general, as regards the extent to which the Australian Government may deem it possible or appropriate to give effect to the Final Act, the Australian delegation draws attention to the statement which it made in plenary on 10 June 1964. <sup> 1  E/CONF.46/STA/130.  </sup> 
### *AUSTRIA* 

In signing the Final Act, the Austrian delegation takes note of its contents as a record of proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The Austrian Government declares its willingness, without prejudice to its rights and obligations under international agreements, to be guided by the general objectives contained in recommendations to which the Austrian delegation has given its support. These recommendations, declarations or other decisions of the Conference which the Austrian delegation could not support will be kept under review in order to ascertain if and to what extent their implementation might be possible at a later stage. 
### *BELGIUM* 

The Belgian delegation to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development requests that the following observations be inserted in the appropriate place in the Final Act. The Final Act and the other acts of the Conference are a set of Recommendations debated in committee and in plenary session. The Belgian view of these Recommendations was therefore expressed in the usual manner in the votes in which the Belgian delegation participated. The Belgian position on certain specific Recommendations was as follows: 
###I. CONCERNING THE DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY THE FIRST COMMITTEE

1. On the Recommendation in Annex A.II.7 (competition from synthetics and substitutes), the position of Belgium, as of the other countries members of the European Communities, was that: 

Paragraph 1 (vii) includes certain provisions regarding “access to markets” which might in practice conflict with the provisions of the Rome Treaty and with provisions adopted under Community policies flowing from that Treaty;  

It was not found possible to bring the present text of paragraph 2, as voted in the First Committee, sufficiently into line with certain aspects of the industrialization policies pursued by one or more of the six countries members of the European Economic Community.    

2. On the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9 it is noted that the text voted in plenary session on 15 June 1964 might in practice conflict with the fiscal policies adopted individually or collectively by the countries members of the European Economic Community.   
###II. CONCERNING THE DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY THE SECOND COMMITTEE

When the Assembly voted on these Recommendations in plenary session, the Belgian delegation: 

Abstained in the vote on: 

*a.* The Recommendation in Annex A.III.2  

*b.* The Recommendation in Annex A.III.7    

Voted against: 

The Recommendation in Annex A.III.1.     This negative vote is justified by the following considerations: Belgium favours a dynamic United Nations programme for industrial development. In its view, therefore, the United Nations Centre for Industrial Development should as part of the activities of the United Nations, become a catalyst for the industrial development of the developing countries. To set up a new specialized agency would, in its view, hardly be a satisfactory method of organizing United Nations assistance for industrial development. The Belgian delegation accordingly voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.III.1. 
###III. CONCERNING THE DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY THE THIRD COMMITTEE

When the Assembly voted on these Recommendations in plenary session, the Belgian delegation: 

Abstained in the vote on: 

*a.* Annex A.IV. 3;  

*b.* Annex A.IV.25;  

*c.* Annex A.IV.12;  

*d.* Annex A.IV. 8;  

*e.* Annex A.IV. 5;  

*g.* Annex A.IV.24;  

*f.* Annex A.IV. 6;  

*h.* Annex A.IV.23;  

*i.* Annex A.IV.26;    

Voted against: 

*a.* Annex A.IV.19;  

*b.* Annex A.IV. 4;  

*c.* Annex A.IV. 9;  

*d.* Annex A.IV. 7;  

*e.* Annex A.IV.15.     
###IV. CONCERNING THE DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY THE FIFTH COMMITTEE

In accordance with the observation included at its request in the report of the Fifth Committee, the Belgian delegation reserves its position on those provisions adopted after the Committee's debates and included in the Final Act on which it formulated observations or against which it voted during the work of the Conference. 
### *BOLIVIA* 

The delegation of Bolivia wishes to record in the Final Act of this Conference the reservation, which it also formulated in one of the meetings of the Fifth Committee's Sub-Committee on Land-locked Countries, to the effect that, even though the principles adopted concerning the land-locked countries (see Annex A.I.2) are an advance and a partial solution of the problems of some countries, Bolivia, as a country which became land-locked and thus constitutes, a special case, will not surrender its right to its own outlet to the sea. 
### *BURMA* 

Regarding the Recommendation on institutional arrangements (Annex A.V.1): 
### *Paragraph 1* 

The delegation of Burma reserves its position on this paragraph as it believes that, since the provisions contained therein do not provide for universality of membership or as near to universality as possible, they do not conform to the criteria laid down by the Preparatory Committee of the Conference at its second session. 
### *Paragraph 5* 

The delegation of Burma reserves its position on this paragraph as it believes that the composition of the Board provided for in the paragraph gives less than adequate representation to the developing countries. 
### *Paragraph 25* 

The delegation of Burma has approved this provision on the understanding that, in the light of the text of paragraph 25 as a whole, which refers only to conciliation procedures and not to voting, the words “to provide an adequate basis for the adoption of recommendations with regard to proposals of a specific nature for action substantially affecting the economic or financial interests of particular countries” shall not lead to the adoption by the Special Committee of any proposal which directly or indirectly would recommend any system of weighted or dual voting or any procedure for blocking the voting power of certain countries or groups of countries. Neither should it constitute the basis for the adoption of any procedure that would prevent voting upon a proposal or recommendation after the normal process of conciliation has taken place. This presupposes that the conciliation procedure should be subject to a deadline after which the proposal or recommendation concerned be voted upon. 
### *Paragraph 31* 

The delegation of Burma reserves its position on this paragraph as it believes that the membership of the comprehensive trade organization envisaged should be open to all States in the world in order to ensure wider international co-operation. 
### *CANADA* 

The delegation of Canada, by its signature, confirms the Final Act as a record of the proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and of the conclusions, recommendations and other texts adopted by it. The Government of Canada will give careful consideration to these conclusions, recommendations and other texts in the light of the positions taken and the votes cast by the delegation of Canada in the course of the Conference. These are reflected in the records and reports of the committees, the sub-committees and plenary meetings of the Conference and in the Final Act. In particular, the delegation of Canada wishes to have it noted that it was not able to vote in favour of the following texts on which the positions of individual delegations have not already been recorded by roll-call votes:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| First Committee  | Annex A.II. 8  Annex A.II. 9  |
| Second Committee  | Annex A.III. 2  Annex A.III. 7  |
| Third Committee  | Annex A.IV. 3  |
| Fourth Committee  | Annex A.V. 2  Annex A.V. 3  |
| Fifth Committee  | Special Principle Six in Annex A.I. 1.  |

The delegation would have abstained if this Special Principle had been put to the vote. The delegation of Canada would wish to have it noted, in addition, that it supported the Recommendation in Annex A.V.I on the understanding that a satisfactory solution would be found for the procedures envisaged in paragraph 25. 
### *CHINA* 

The Republic of China has no, and does not intend to establish, trade relations with countries with centrally-planned economy. Therefore, the Government of the Republic of China will not apply the Recommendations adopted by this Conference with respect to these countries. 
### *CUBA* 

The delegation of the Republic of Cuba wishes to record in the Final Act its dissent from the texts referring to private national and foreign capital in paragraphs 20 and 41 of the First Part (Preamble) of the Final Act. Similarly, it wishes to record its reservation with regard to the Recommendations approved in the final plenary meeting insofar as the said Recommendations amend or delete, in whole or in part, the recommendations in favour of which the delegation of Cuba voted in the First, Second and Fourth Committees. 
### *CZECHOSLOVAKIA* 

The Czechoslovak delegation reserves its position on those Recommendations and conclusions where it has recorded an abstention, or where it has not taken part in the voting. These reservations are contained in the reports of the Committee as well as in the summary records of the meetings. 
### *DENMARK* 

The Danish delegation has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8 with the understanding that the questions dealt with in this Recommendation which have not been considered by the Second Committee, i.e. the reference to “exchanges of goods and services” contained in Section IV, paragraph (b) are to be regarded as open for further consideration. Furthermore, the Danish delegation considers that the terms of reference of any further study of shipping must be consistent with the arrangements set out in the Common Measures of Understanding on Shipping Questions (Annex A.IV.22) as provided in the Third Committee. 
### *ETHIOPIA* 

The Ethiopian delegation reserves its position in relation to paragraphs of the Final Act in respect of which it has submitted amendments contained in document E/CONF.46/L.23., particularly on the following paragraphs of document E/CONF. 46/L.10 (Preamble). 
### *Section I, paragraph 8* 

This paragraph does not accurately reflect the findings and conclusions of the First and Fifth Committees in respect to the slow rate of growth of exports from developing countries. 
### *Section III, paragraph 30, and Section IV, paragraphs 42 and 43* 

These paragraphs do not reflect the decisions and conclusions of the Second and Fifth Committees to the effect that trade between developing countries should be on a mutually advantageous basis. 
### *Section IV, paragraph 37* 

The arrangement of this paragraph is not in line with the report of the First Committee. In the view of the Ethiopian delegation, access to markets should precede international commodity arrangements in line with the conclusions of the First Committee. In regard to paragraph 25 of the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 the Ethiopian delegation would like to make the following reservation: In studying the procedures of conciliation the Special Committee shall confine itself to the procedures of conciliation only, and shall not in any way discuss matters which will tamper with the sovereign rights of States Members of the United Nations, (any system of weighted and plural voting), the principle of one country one vote respected and followed in the United Nations. We strongly feel that this observation should be made available to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the Special Committee. 
### *FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY* 

### *General observations* 

The representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, by his signature, confirms the Final Act as a record of the proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as well as of the conclusions, recommendations and other texts adopted by it. The votes cast by the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the opinions and observations it has expressed, as contained in the summary records of the Committees, sub-committees and plenary meetings of the Conference and in the Final Act reflect its position regarding the conclusions, recommendations and other texts of the Conference. In the light of this position the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will carefully study which constructive contributions it can make for the realization of the objectives of the Conference. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1* 

With respect to paragraph II.3 c of this Recommendation, the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany would like to draw the attention to the fact that according to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany any decision concerning the reduction or elimination of taxes falls within the competence of the Parliament the decisions of which the German Government is unable to prejudice. Moreover, the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany refers to its explanations in this matter which were given during the sessions of the First Committee. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.17* 

The delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.17 on the understanding that the requirements under operative paragraph 3 to study possible ways of securing refinancing of International Monetary Fund compensatory drawings would be met by virtue of the study to be undertaken by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development under Part A of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1* 

The Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 which determines the institutional arrangements provides in paragraph 25, *inter alia,* that proposals on certain matters concerning procedures and voting shall be submitted by a Special Committee before the General Assembly of the United Nations takes a decision. The Federal Republic of Germany hopes that it will be given the opportunity to express its views on the proposals before they are submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations. 
### *FINLAND* 

###OBSERVATION I

The delegate of Finland by his signature confirms the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as a record of the proceedings of the Conference. The position of the Finnish delegation on the various recommendations, declarations and other decisions adopted by the Conference annexed to the Final Act is indicated in the statements made and the votes cast, as reflected in the records of the Conference. 
###OBSERVATION II

In recognizing the great needs of the developing countries to increase their earnings from exports of primary commodities, the delegation of Finland wishes to state that, because of financial reasons and conditions prevailing in agriculture in Finland, the possibilities of the Finnish Government to implement the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1, especially in respect of Part II, “Actions recommended to be taken by developed market economy nations”, are limited. The Government of Finland will on the other hand, give careful and continuous attention to the said Recommendation. 
### *FRANCE* 

### *Observation on the Final Act of the Conference* 

The French delegation observes that the Final Act contains certain declarations and recommendations on which it was obliged to state its position when votes were taken in committee or in plenary meeting. Consequently the approval given by the French delegation to the Final Act should be interpreted in the light of the observations or reservations which it expressed concerning those recommendations, and in the light of those expressed on behalf of the six States members of the European Economic Community by the representative of Belgium when he stated that he was speaking as the spokesman of those six States. 
### *Observations concerning the Principles adopted by the Conference and shown in Annex A.I.1* 

The delegation abstained on the following General Principles: Three, Four, Five, on the amendment to Principle Seven and on Principle Seven as amended, Eight, Nine, Eleven, Fourteen. It also abstained on Special Principles Five, Six, Seven, Eleven, Twelve. With respect to Special Principle One, which it approved, the French delegation intended to support consultations between developing countries and developed countries concerning the development plans and programmes of the former. 
### *Reservations and observations concerning the Recommendation of the First Committee shown in Annex A.II.7* 

The French delegation reserves its position on paragraph 1 (vii) and 2 of the recommendation in Annex A.II.7 (Competition from synthetics and substitutes) and therefore cannot support their implementation. It considers that: *With respect to paragraph 1 (vii):* this includes certain provisions referring to “access to markets” which might, if applied, conflict with the application of provisions of the Treaty of Rome and of Community policies flowing from that Treaty. *With respect to paragraph 2,* the wording of the text voted for in the First Committee was not sufficiently redrafted to take into account certain effects of the policies of industrialization pursued by one or more of the six member countries of the European Economic Community. 
### *Observations on the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9* 

The French delegation cannot subscribe to the provisions of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9 as voted by the Plenary Assembly on 15 June 1964. These provisions, as worded in this document, are incompatible with the fiscal policy of the French Government. 
### *Observations concerning Recommendations submitted by the Second Committee to the Plenary Assembly* 

The French delegation: 

1. Voted against the adoption of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.1;  

2. Abstained from voting on: 

The Recommendation in Annex A.III.2  

The Recommendation in Annex A.III.7;    

3. Voted in favour of the Recommendations in Annexes A.III.6, A.III.8, A.III.3, A.III.4 and A.III.5.   
### *Reservations and observations concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.III.3* 

Some developing countries impose taxes on certain raw materials when exported, or hinder their clearance, whereas at the same time their exports of products manufactured with these raw materials are exempt from duty or benefit by various direct or indirect advantages. There is the danger that such practices may seriously disturb industries processing these raw materials in other countries. The French delegation states that its vote for the Recommendation in Annex A.III.3 submitted by the Second Committee does not mean that it would approve such wrongful practices if they were covered by paragraph B.II.4. 
### *Reservations and observations concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8* 

Recognizing the need for closer economic co-operation between the developing countries, the French delegation has decided in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8. Nevertheless; it considers that if, in application of the provisions of paragraphs III (e), IV (a) (v) and IV (b), all the developing countries granted from the beginning tariff or other preferences to each other, establishment of the regional economic groupings, which represents the most effective form of co-operation, would be hindered thereby. 
### *Observations on the Recommendations submitted by the Third Committee* 

On the occasion of the vote in the Plenary Assembly, the French delegation: 

1. Voted against the adoption of: 

(1) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV.19  

(2) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 7    

2. Abstained in the vote on: 

(1) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 3  

(2) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 4  

(3) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV.25  

(4) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 9  

(5) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 8  

(6) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 5  

(7) The Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 6  

(8) The Recommendation. in Annex A.IV.15    

3. Would have abstained, had there been a vote, when the Recommendation in Annex A.IV. 10 was adopted.   Further, the French delegation requests that the text, annexed hereto, of the reservations and observations relating to the seventeen Recommendations of the Third Committee be reproduced at the appropriate place in the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This communication refers only to the reservations formulated in connexion with the votes on the Recommendations submitted by the Third Committee. Other communications will be submitted on the other votes in the Plenary Assembly. 
###Annex A.IV.1

The French delegation, without questioning the importance of the principle laid down in paragraph 1 (d), points out that its acceptance cannot be interpreted as a general commitment which would limit its freedom of choice with respect to the application of its aid policy. It wishes further to make clear that its acceptance of paragraph 1 (g) should not be interpreted as a commitment on its part. As regards paragraphs 1 (b) and 2, reference should be made to the observations on the Recommendations in Annexes A.IV. 18 and A.IV.5. 
###Annexes A.IV.3 and A.IV.4

The French delegation abstained from voting on these two Recommendations, as it has serious reservations with respect to the second part of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.3 and paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 11 of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.4. 
###Annex A.IV.25

Although in agreement with a large number of the ideas contained in this Recommendation, the French delegation cannot vote for it because of the rigid nature of certain of the measures for which it makes provision. 
###Annex A.IV.11

The French delegation draws attention to the fact that capital borrowed on international markets, guaranteed by the international community, and re-lent at very low rates of interest made possible by an interest equalization fund, is definitely of the nature of public resources rather than private capital; hence, while it considers studies in this field to be useful, it doubts that the use of such methods will permit an effective increase in the volume of financial assistance. 
###Annex A.IV.9

The French delegation considers that the establishment of new development funds would serve no useful purpose and would even be harmful. The functions in view can be carried out satisfactorily by existing general or regional bodies. There is no ground for the belief that the establishment of new bodies would bring about an increase in the total volume of assistance; on the contrary, they would serve to increase costs and to dissipate resources and efforts. 
###Annex A.IV.10

As the Recommendation was adopted without a vote, the French delegation had no opportunity to state that it wished to abstain from the vote on the first operative paragraph in order not to restrict its freedom of action in carrying out its assistance policy. 
###Annex A.IV.12

The French delegation would point out that the list, in paragraph A.1, of some of the measures likely to stimulate the flow of private investment capital cannot be regarded as exhaustive; it expresses a reservation regarding the second part of this paragraph (“such as ... developing countries”). In addition, the French delegation considers that the “appropriate steps” referred to in paragraph B.3 (first sentence) should include, in particular, the conclusion of international agreements with a view to improving the conditions for private investment. 
###Annexes A.IV.7 and A.IV.8

In voting against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.7 and in abstaining from the vote on the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.8, the French delegation wished to recall that it was opposed to any extension of the activities of the Special Fund to the field of investment because other specialized agencies of the United Nations are responsible for that field and such an extension might jeopardize the effective action of the Special Fund in the pre-investment sector. 
###Annex A.IV.5

In abstaining from the vote on this Recommendation the French delegation wished to indicate that any procedure which was too general or too systematic in rature to permit re-scheduling of the external debt might have results contrary to the objectives sought. Such arrangements can only be considered case by case and by agreement between the debtor country and its creditors, and in liaison, if necessary, with the international institutions concerned. 
###Annex A.IV.14

While approving the principle of a study of these questions, the French delegation expresses serious reservations concerning the content pf the document annexed to the Recommendation. 
###Annex A.IV.15

In abstaining on this text, the French delegation wished to indicate that it did not contemplate participating in the financing of such a fund if established. 
###Annex A.IV.18

The French delegation has not, by its vote in favour of this Recommendationaccepted the principle of any scheme for the long-term compensation of fluctuations in export earnings; in its opinion, the real solution lies in the organization of primary produce markets, permitting the maintenance of stable and remunerative prices. 
###Annex A.IV.17

The French delegation recalls that it would be premature to reach a final decision on a system which has been in existence for only one year and which has so far been put to very little use; the modifications described by the text should therefore be examined in the light of experience, when more substantial experience has been acquired. Further, their compatibility with the liquidity of the International Monetary Fund should be studied. Moreover, the French delegation expressed the same reservations with respect to operative paragraph 3 as in the case of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18 
###Annex A.IV.24

Although it voted in favour of the text, the French delegation has serious reservations to make with respect to paragraph 17 of this Recommendation. 
###Annex A.IV.26

The French delegation considers that the conclusions of international agreements on this subjects would be undesirable. 
### *Observations on the Recommendation in Annex A.V.I (Institutional arrangements methods and machinery to implement measures relating to the expansion of international trade)* 

The French delegation voted for the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1. Nevertheless, it finds the drafting of paragraph 25 unnecessarily complicated. It would have preferred a simpler wording, which would not have prejudged in any way the direction in which solutions to the difficulties in question should be sought, or the manner in which a problem should be settled before any steps had even been taken to study it. The French delegation observes that the provisions for implementing certain recommendations make explicit reference to institutional machinery which still has to be established. The French delegation must therefore reserve its position with respect to these recommendations until this machinery has been established by the United Nations General Assembly and it can form a final judgment thereon. 
### *HUNGARY* 

The Hungarian delegation maintains its reservations and observations made in the different Committees as regards the following: Section IV of the Preamble to the Final Act, paragraph 38, dealing with compensatory financing; The Recommendation in Annex A.II.6 (World Food Aid Programme); The Recommendation in Annex A.II.7, point 2 (Competition from synthetics and substitutes). As regards the Recommendations in Annexes A.IV.2, A.IV.4, A.IV.5, A.IV.8, A.IV.9, A. IV.11, A.IV.12, A.IV.16 and A.IV.15, the Hungarian delegation abstained from voting, taking into account the points of view expressed on these items during the debate in the Third Committee. Referring to the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.1, the Hungarian delegation shares the reservations expressed on this Recommendation by the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The delegation also adheres to the observations made by the delegation of the USSR on the Principles contained in the Final Act. 
### *IRELAND* 

###GENERAL OBSERVATION

The Head of the delegation of Ireland signs the Final Act as a record of the proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The . recommendations, conclusions and other texts adopted by the Conference will be the subject of careful study by the Government of Ireland. The attitude of the delegation towards specific items has been indicated during the proceedings and is reflected in the voting and other declarations of the delegation as recorded in the documentation of the Conference and the Final Act. Annex A.II.8 Annex A.II.9 (Minerals and fuels) Annex A.IV.2 

The delegation of Ireland abstained in the voting on these items.   Annex A.V.2 Annex A.V.3 

The delegation of Ireland voted against the adoption of these recommendations.   
### *ITALY* 

###DECLARATION OF RESERVATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS TO THE FINAL ACT

The Italian delegation wishes to state that, in signing the present Final Act of the Conference, it does not intend to withdraw the observation which it put forward when the instruments subsequently submitted to the Plenary Conference were adopted by the various Committees. 
###RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF THE RECOMMENDATION IN ANNEX A.II.1 (INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS AND REMOVAL OF OBSTACLES AND EXPANSION OF TRADE)

The Italian delegation approved the above mentioned recommendation but wishes to point out that, in connexion with the provisions of paragraph A, 3(b) and (c) of Section II, it is impossible for Italy, in view of its present economic and financial situation, to undertake the reduction of tariff and fiscal charges which, in any event, are subject to parliamentary decisions on which no advance commitment can be given. 
###RESERVATION ON THE RECOMMENDATION IN ANNEX A.II.9 (MINERALS AND FUELS)

The Italian delegation did not give its approval to the provisions contained in the above-mentioned Recommendation because, apart from any other consideration, Italy's present economic and financial situation does not allow it to modify the fiscal treatment applicable in Italy to the products covered by the said Recommeridations. 
### *JAMAICA* 

The Jamaican delegation wishes to make the following observation: Whilst it agrees in principle to transitional arrangements for the phasing out of preferential arrangements, it cannot agree with the Recommendation contained in section II.A, paragraph 6,, of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.l, unless the following points are included in the recommendation: *First,* the principle of the gradual phasing-out of existing preferential arrangements between developed and developing countries which involve discrimination against other developing countries should be applied *generally* and not restricted solely to arrangements between developed and developing countries. In other words those preferential arrangements by developing countries in regional groupings which discriminate against other developing countries must also be removed. *Second,* the “international measures providing at least equivalent advantages” for the developing countries affected by the gradual phasing-out of preferential arrangements should consist not only of satisfactory financial compensation, but must also include other measures to offset the social and economic repercussions resulting from the loss of preferential arrangements. There would have to be the clear understanding that such international measures would include *inter alia* extension of general preferences by *all* developed countries in favour of all developing countries. *Third,* preferential arrangements between developed and developing countries essential for the maintenance and growth of the export earnings of the developing countries which are based on contractual obligations between developing and developed countries can be phased out only by mutual agreement between the developed and developing countries concerned. *Fourth,* special machinery should be established to ensure that “equivalent advantages” *do* accrue to the developing countries that would be affected by the gradual phasing-out of preferential arrangements, *before* the gradual abolition of those preferential arrangements is initiated. *Fifth,* the body of the United Nations responsible for the supervision of the phasing out of existing preferential arrangements should be obliged to consult the developed and developing countries concerned and measures should be established to safeguard the interests of the affected developing country. 
### *JAPAN* 

The delegation of Japan reserves its position with regard to all the Recommendations and the Principles adopted by the Conference and embodied in the Final Act in respect of which it has recorded a negative vote or an abstention. Furthermore, in cases where the Japanese delegation cast its vote in favour of a Recommendation containing a reference to the continuing machinery to be established, such voting was based upon the assumption that this continuing machinery would be acceptable to Japan. The Japanese delegation also wishes to make the following observations on some Recommendations in respect of which it cast an affirmative vote: 
###FIRST COMMITTEE

1. In supporting the Recommendation in Annex A.II.l, the Japanese delegation wished the following points to be noted: 

*a.* Japan would find greater difficulties than other developed countries in implementing the provisions of the Recommendation, because of some of the under-developed elements in its economic structure, particularly in a field of agriculture and small scale industries;  

*b.* In dealing with commodity problems, major emphasis should be placed on primary products mainly or wholly produced in developing countries;  

*c.* In translating the proposals in this Recommendation into action, due account should also be taken of the interests of importing developed countries;  

*d.* In seeking a solution of international commodity problems, care should be taken not to interfere unduly with domestic policies of importing developed countries.    

2. With respect to the Recommendations in Annex A.II.9, the Japanese delegation abstained from voting.   
###SECOND COMMITTEE

### *Recommendation in Annex A.III.8* 

The delegation of Japan voted for this Recommendation on the understanding that rules, procedures and conditions for the establishment of a preferential system among developing countries should be negotiated by developing and developed countries together in an appropriate international forum in order to safeguard the interests of third countries. 
### *Recommendation in Annex A.III.4* 

### *Paragraphs 9, 10 and 11* 

In respect of a limited number of products, there may be cases where Japan would be unable to conform to the principles set forth in these paragraphs. Japan reserves its rights to reconsider the extension of the benefits deriving from the international negotiations as referred to in this paragraph to those countries which apply discriminatory trade practices against it, whether they participate in such international negotiations or not. 
###THIRD COMMITTEE

### *Recommendation in Annex A.IV.1* 

Japan voted for this Recommendation on the understanding that studies as referred to in paragraph l(j) would be conducted within the scope of the provisions of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.14. 
### *Recommendation in Annex A.IV.17* 

Japan accepted this Recommendation on the understanding that the requirements under operative paragraph 3 to study possible ways of securing re-financing of international Monetary Fund compensatory drawings would be met by virtue of the study to be undertaken by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in pursuance of Section A of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18. 
### *Recommendation in Annex A.IV.21* 

Japan wished it to be noted that, in its view, the terms of reference of any further study of shipping must be consistent with the arrangements set out in the “Common Measure of Understanding on Shipping Questions” (Annex A.IV.22). 
### *KUWAIT* 

The delegation of Kuwait would like to state here that when it voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.4, it understood that the expression “donor countries” on the first line of the sixth paragraph of the preambular section of this Recommendation referred to developed countries. 
### *LIECHTENSTEIN* 

###GENERAL COMMENT

The delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein, in signing the Final Act, welcomes the conclusion of the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein will carefully study the results of the Conference in order to ascertain what it can contribute to the fulfilment of the Conference's objectives expressed in the recommendations, including the principles, and the declarations embodied in the Final Act, having due regard to the attitude of the delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein towards those objectives. 
### *LUXEMBOURG* 

The delegation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has signed this Final Act on the understanding that it is no more than a record of the proceedings of the Conference and of the Recommendations adopted by the Conference. The position of the delegation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on a certain number of issues, whether jointly or severally, is specified in the summary records of the committees and of the plenary meetings of the Conference, as well as in the Final Act itself. The delegation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg states that it holds a position identical with that of the Belgian delegation and therefore presents the same observations as those formulated by that delegation (see above). 
### *KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS* 

The delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has signed this Final Act on the understanding that it constitutes a record of the proceedings, discussions and recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The position taken by the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands either jointly or separately on a number of issues can be found in the summary records of the committees, sub-committees and plenary of the Conference as well as in the Final Act itself. Regarding the following Recommendations that have been voted upon by a show of hands, the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has voted against: 

Annex A.II. 9  

Annex A.IV.3, paragraph 1  

Annex A.V. 3   Regarding the following Recommendations that have been voted upon by show of hands, the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has abstained from voting: 

Annex A.II. 9  

Annex A.III.2  

Annex A.III.7  

Annex A.V. 2  

Annex A.VI.2  

Annex A.VI.3   Regarding the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.21 the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands wishes to point out that in its view, any further study on shipping should be carried out through the International Maritime Consultative Organization, the existing United Nations specialized agency on shipping. 
### *NEW ZEALAND* 

The New Zealand delegation, in signing the Final Act and thus accepting it as a correct record of the Conference, makes the following observations: 

(a) It is the view of the delegation that there should have been explicit recognition by the Conference of the fact that countries are diverse in their stages of growth and in the aims and structures of their economies. Just as there are differences in the needs of various countries for special protection and assistance, so also are there differences in the capacities of various countries to extend such protection and assistance.  

(b) The delegation shares the opinion that the Principles are incomplete and susceptible to further improvement. In particular, it considers that they should be supplemented by the following principle: 

“International measures of co-operation in the field of trade and development should have regard to differences among countries in their economic and trade structures and the size and stage of development of their economies.”   The delegation's attitude to all the principles adopted by the Conference is qualified by these considerations.  

(c) The delegation considers that if the stated objectives of General Assembly resolution 1710 (XVI) launching the Development Decade, and of the sponsors of resolution 1785 (XVII) calling for this Conference, are to be realized, the position of Countries highly dependent on the export of a small range of primary commodities should be more explicitly recognized.  

(d) The delegation notes that New Zealand, in acting upon the recommendations of the Conference, will necessarily be influenced by the nature of and conditions affecting its trade and economy.   
### *NORWAY* 

###RESERVATION ON THE RECOMMENDATION IN ANNEX A.III.8

The Norwegian delegation makes a reservation with regard to the reference to services at the end of Section IV (b) of the Recommendation, a matter which has not been considered by the Second Committee. 
### *PAKISTAN* 

Subject to the observation and reservation made by the Pakistan delegation in the Fifth Committee and in the Sub-Committee on Land-Locked Countries, the Recommendations in Annexes A.I.2 and A.VI.1 may be accepted. 
### *PORTUGAL* 

The Portuguese delegation, in signing the Final Act, declares that its Government will make the fullest possible constructive contribution towards attainment of the objectives of the Conference. In signing the Recommendations for which it voted, the Portuguese delegation intended that they should be put into effect with due regard to the special situation arising out of the different stages of development existing within the Portuguese economic sphere. 
### *REPUBLIC OF KOREA* 

The delegation of the Republic of Korea requests its reservations in regard to the points listed below: 

1. Section II. B. of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1 (First Committee)  

2. The Recommendations in Annexes A.III.2 and A.III.7 (Second Committee)  

3. General Principle Six in Annex A.I.1 (Fifth Committee)   These reservations are based on the doubt of the delegation of the Republic of Korea about the possibility of promoting trade between the countries having different economic and social systems. 
### *ROMANIA* 

The Romanian delegation is of the opinion that all the Recommendations of the Conference concerning the principles and measures to be adopted in the sphere of international trade and development should be addressed to all States without discrimination of any kind and that the implications of the documents adopted should be universal. 
### *SOUTH AFRICA* 

The recommendations of the Conference generally divide all countries into only two categories, namely, developing countries and developed countries. These recommendations do not take account of countries which, while sharing some of the problems of “developing” countries, neither need nor seek accommodation to the extent and depth required by the “developing” countries and, while also sharing some common features with “developed” countries cannot agree, because of their own development needs, to inequitable treatment adversely affecting their own trade and development and cannot accept all the obligations formulated for acceptance by “developed” countries. South Africa is such a country which is clearly neither a “developed” nor a “developing” country, in the context of the deliberations of the Conference and the sense in which these terms are used in this Final Act. The Government of South Africa fully recognizes the urgent need for the accelerated development of developing countries and the role which the implementation of recommendations for the expansion of international trade can play in the promotion of such development. In the circumstances, the Government of South Africa will take note of the recommendations of the Conference and will consider, with due regard to South Africa's own development needs, policies and special economic conditions, implementing the recommendations adopted by the Conference. To this end, the Government of South Africa will co-operate with all other Governments desiring such co-operation to lay the foundations of a better world economic order. Furthermore, signature of this Final Act is without prejudice to the position which the South African Government may take with respect to those recommendations of the Conference for which the South African delegation has not voted in the affirmative. 
### *SWITZERLAND* 

###GENERAL OBSERVATION

In signing the Final Act, the Swiss delegation takes note of the conclusion of the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The Swiss Government will study its results with the greatest care, in order to determine what constructive contribution Switzerland can make towards the attainment of the objectives brought out by the Conference and defined in the recommendations (including the principles) and declarations which are incorporated in the Final Act, having regard to the attitude to those objectives expressed by Switzerland in its votes, comments and statements at the Conference. 
### *Observation concerning the Principles in Annex A.I.1* 

In the vote by show of hands on *Special Principle Six,* Switzerland abstained. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1* 

### *(International commodity arrangements and removal of obstacles and expansion of trade)* 

The Swiss delegation has approved the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1, subject to the following remarks: Switzerland's liberal import policy has already had substantial results for exporters in the developing countries. Most of the country's food requirements are met by unprocessed, processed or semi-processed agricultural products imported from countries in tropical or temperate zones. Import duties in particular are moderate, and experience has shown that they have never had an adverse affect on the consumption of these products. In general, duties and taxes levied on imported commodities form part of the State revenue, and the State must be careful not to reduce them without good reason. Further, owing to the special conditions existing in the country, Switzerland is obliged to apply price support measures for its key agricultural products. While aiming to maintain the *status quo* and to take further steps when this appears necessary and possible to increase the consumption of agricultural products and foodstuffs in general, the Swiss authorities will have to continue adjusting these price support measures to agricultural policy requirements in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Swiss constitution and legislative provisions. Subject to the same conditions, they will support efforts to conclude satisfactory international agreements on commodities. These observations also apply to the other recommendations (including principles) adopted by the Conference, in so far as they refer to similar questions. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.II.8* 

### *(Study of organization of commodity trade)* 

The Swiss delegation abstained from voting on the Recommendation in Annex A.II.8, as it does not consider the idea of linking commodity prices to the prices of essential goods imported by the developing countries to be either realistic or practical. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9* 

### *(Minerals and fuel)* 

The Swiss delegation opposed the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.III.5* 

### *(Methods of implementing a programme of preferences in favour of developing countries)* 

Switzerland believes that the granting of preferences to developing countries by developed countries would expose the international trading system to risks which are out of proportion to the limited and precarious advantages which preferences might offer in certain cases. It is consequently opposed to preferences of this kind, but it is in favour of special advantages for the developing countries which - without infringing the most-favoured-nation clause - would effectively encourage the growth and diversification of their exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures to industrialized countries. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8* 

### *(Measures and action for the promotion of trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among developing countries)* 

The Swiss delegation approved the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8. It wishes to specify, however, that in its view the preferences which developing countries may grant one another (sections III(e) and IV(b) of the recommendation) should be designed to promote an expansion of the markets of those countries and thereby widen the basis of their industrial production. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendations in Annex A.IV.25 on Conditions of economic and technical co-operation and A.IV.26 on Transfer of technology* 

The Swiss delegation voted in favour of the Recommendations in Annexes A.IV.25 and A.IV.26. In connexion with those two Recommendations, it points out that the Swiss Government has no power to compel private industries to communicate technical information or to grant patents or licences to foreign countries. Such transfers are, however, a common practice. The Swiss delegation interprets paragraph 2 of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.26 as meaning that developing countries which adopt appropriate legislative and administrative measures in the field of industrial technology will do so with a view to promoting and facilitating the transfer of technical knowledge without interfering with intellectual property rights. 
### *Observation concerning the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 (Institutional arrangements, methods and machinery to implement measures relating to the expansion of international trade)* 

The Swiss delegation approved the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1. That Recommendation contains a provision to the effect that proposals on certain matters are to be made by a Special Committee before the United Nations General Assembly takes a decision. Switzerland attaches great importance to the implementation of the objectives of this Conference and would welcome an opportunity of expressing its views in due course on the proposals to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. To the preceding observations should be added a joint observation made by certain developed countries on the establishment of a specialized agency for industrial development, which has been submitted by the Belgian delegation. <sup> 1  See observations submitted by Belgium, above; see also the summary record of the thirty-fifth plenary meeting, E/CONF.46/SR.35, page 5.  </sup> 
### *UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS* 

###RESERVATIONS

### *1. Principles governing international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development (Annex A.I.1)* 

### *General Principle Five* 

The Soviet delegation, although endorsing the idea underlying this Principle, and having voted for its adoption, cannot approve the final words, “... and should encourage appropriate adjustments *in their own economies* to this end”, since these matters are governed, not by international standards, but by each country's sovereign law. 
### *General Principle Eight* 

The Soviet delegation voted in favour of this Principle, although of the opinion that it does not cover all aspects of the question concerned. In its view, the Principle should be amplified by the following provision: “No developed country shall, in its trade with the developing countries, enjoy any particular privileges and advantages which are not accorded to all other developed countries.” “Developed countries enjoying particular privileges and advantages pursuant to preferential agreements previously concluded with developing countries shall accordingly renounce such privileges and advantages as soon as possible.” 
### *General Principle Twelve* 

The Soviet delegation fully supports the idea underlying this Principle, since the Soviet Union is a consistent advocate of general and complete disarmament and of the allocation of part of the resources that will be released by an appropriate agreement for the economic development needs of the developing countries. It was, however, compelled to abstain from voting on this text, because the wording differs from that approved by the United Nations General Assembly. Since the Conference did not specifically consider the economic and commercial aspects of disarmament, the Soviet delegation deems it essential that the text approved by the United Nations General Assembly should be retained in the recommendations of the Conference. 
### *Special Principle Seven* 

The Soviet delegation abstained from voting on this Principle, since the text does not reflect the USSR proposal regarding the need to promote the conclusion, with the participation of all the major exporters and importers of the commodities concerned, of international commodity stabilization agreements, which would establish economically justified price levels and provide for the steady growth of trade in these commodities having regard to the interests of all countries concerned. In the view of the Soviet delegation, action on this proposal is the most effective means to ensure stabilization of prices in the interests of developing countries. 
### *2. International trade in primary commodities* 

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics abstained in the vote on the following Recommendations of the First Committee, which are included in the annexes to the Final Act: A.II.6 (since this requires additional study); and A.II.7, paragraph 2 (since this does not take into account the special features of the planned socialist economy). 
### *3. Financing for an expansion of international trade and international compensatory financing* 

Since in some Recommendations the special features of the planned socialist economy have not been taken into account, the USSR delegation abstained from voting on the recommendations set forth in the following annexes to the Final Act: A.IV.2, A.IV.4, A.IV.5, A.IV.8, A.IV.9, A.IV.11, A.IV.12, A.IV.16, A.IV.15, A.IV.18 and A.IV.1, paragraphs l(c) and 5; it also considers that paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Recommendation do not concern the USSR. Furthermore, the wording of paragraph 38 of Section IV of the Preamble to the Final Act is, in the opinion of the USSR delegation inaccurate and incomplete. 
### *UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND* 

###A. GENERAL TEXT

The delegation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in signing the Final Act as a record of the proceedings of the Conference, do so on their understanding that the Recommendations and views therein expressed are to be read in the light of the explanations and observations which the delegation have made and the votes which they have cast in the course of the Conference. In those cases in which the delegation voted in favour of a Recommendation embodying a reference to institutions recommended by the Conference, this vote was made on the assumption that any such institutions will be satisfactory to the United Kingdom. 
###B. TEXTS RELATING TO PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS

###FIRST COMMITTEE

### *Annex A.II.1* 

The delegation voted for this Recommendation. The attitude of the delegation to international commodity arrangements has already been set out in the draft recommendation they presented, and in the First Committee's summary records and report. With regard to Part I of this Recommendation, the United Kingdom view remains that prices in commodity arrangements can be determined only in relation to the circumstances of the commodity concerned. On Section D of Part I of this Recommendation, the delegation agree that consideration should be given to the establishment of a Commission on International Commodity Arrangements and Policies. However, it has been recognized that there was no opportunity for a substantive discussion of the proposals in Section D, either in the First or the Fourth Committees. Accordingly, it is the opinion of the delegation that the details of Section D remain to be considered. Some of these are unlikely to be acceptable to the United Kingdom and the delegation must therefore maintain their position until substantive discussions have taken place, particularly in regard to the proposed executive functions of the Commission and its relationship with other international bodies in this field. 
### *Annex A.II.4* 

The delegation voted for this Recommendation. With reference to sub-item (g), they consider that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Information Centre should be the body responsible, within the United Nations family, for trade information and market research. 
### *Annex A.II.8* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.II.9* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
###SECOND COMMITTEE

### *Annex A.III.1* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.III.3* 

The delegation does not approve of all the methods of promoting exports described in paragraph B.II.4 of this Recommendation. 
###THIRD COMMITTEE

### *Annex A.IV.19* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.3* 

The delegation voted against operative paragraph 1 and abstained in the vote on this Recommendation as a whole. 
### *Annex A.IV.4* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.25* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.9* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.7* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.8* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.6* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.15* 

The delegation voted against this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.IV.17* 

The delegation voted for this Recommendation on the understanding that the requirement under operative paragraph 3 to study possible ways of securing refinancing of International Monetary Fund compensatory drawings would be met by virtue of the study to be undertaken by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in pursuance of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18. 
### *Annex A.IV.21* 

The delegation consider that the terms of reference of any further study of shipping must be consistent with the arrangements set out in the “Common Measure of Understanding on Shipping Questions” (Annex A.IV.22). 
### *Annex A.IV.23* 

The delegation sympathized with the legitimate aspirations of developing countries in the field of insurance. They have therefore co-operated in drafting the revised Recommendation in terms which probably represent the broadest measure of understanding which can be reached in this difficult and technical field. The delegation must, however, emphasize the importance which they attach to the statement in the preamble to the Recommendation, that the characteristics of insurance and reinsurance activities, in general, require operation on an international basis. In their view insurance and reinsurance business should be free from any restrictions controls which are not in the interests of policy holders. In associating themselves with the Recommendation, in accordance with the spirit of this Conference, the United Kingdom delegation must not be assumed to be departing in any way from these views. 
###FOURTH COMMITTEE

### *Annex A.V.1* 

The United Kingdom delegation record their view that institutional arrangements can only effectively serve the interests of the developing countries if they secure the agreement of individual countries, whether developing or developed; having due regard for their national sovereignty and their legitimate economic interests. It is accordingly the view of the delegation that when the General Assembly comes to completing the proposals on institutional arrangements for which the foundation has been laid in the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1, it will be essential that the final arrangements should have due regard for the interest of all countries if they are to be of practical value. 
###FIFTH COMMITTEE

### *Annex A.VI.2* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.VI.5* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.VI.3* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.VI.4* 

The delegation abstained in the vote on this Recommendation. 
### *Annex A.I.1* 

The delegation either voted against, or abstained from voting, as follows: 

*Against*  

General Principles 3, 7, 8, 11, 14.  

Special Principles 7, 12.     

*Abstained*  

General Principles 1, 2, 4, 5, 12.  

Special Principles 1, 8, 9, 11.     On Special Principle 6, the delegation declared that they, like some other delegations, would have abstained if a vote had been taken. 
### *UNITED STATES OF AMERICA* 

###OBSERVATIONS

The United States has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.5 concerning promotion of trade between developing countries because it considers that the subject is an important one and that the resolution as a whole is appropriately addressed to the problem. It is opposed, however, to the provisions of subparagraphs (e) and (k), since they provide a blanket endorsement of regional payments unions and such forms of payments methods as may be agreed to by developing countries, without regard to their merits. The United States has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.7 concerning competition from synthetics and substitutes because the Recommendation contains many constructive features which may help developing countries in meeting the competition of synthetic products. The United States is opposed, however, to the provisions of sub-paragraph l(xi), regarding the possible use of mixing regulations, since it regards such measures as a restrictive and therefore undesirable method of helping the developing countries. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.II.8 concerning a study of organization of commodity trade. The Recommendation prejudges the results of the proposed study, by its request that a programme of action be drawn up. It also suggests that import purchasing power can and should be stabilized through regulation of commodity prices. For these reasons, the United States could not support the Recommendation. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9 on minerals and fuels. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.III.2 concerning industrial branch agreements. It considers that industrial branch agreements as contemplated in the terms of the Recommendation would tend to impede rather than to further the growth of efficient industries in the developing countries and the expansion of their exports on a sound and enduring basis. The United States abstained in the vote on the Recommendation in Annex A.III.7 concerning measures by centrally-planned economies for expansion and diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries. The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8 concerning promotion of trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among developing countries as it favours efforts of developing countries in the same economic region to join together to form larger markets and to cooperate to achieve accelerated economic development. It does not, however, support the principle that developing countries which are not engaged in this close regional co-operation for development to enter into discriminatory trade relationships of the kind apparently envisaged by the terms of certain provisions of the Recommendation. Accordingly, the United States is opposed to the following provisions of the Recommendation: 

1. Paragraph (e), Section III;  

2. The phrase “both generally and among themselves and...” in paragraph (a), Section IV;  

3. Sub-paragraph (v) of paragraph (a), Section IV; and  

4. The following portion of paragraph (b), Section IV: 

“and in particular permit developing countries to grant each other concessions, not extended to developing countries, in view of the requirement to meet the needs during a transitional period of developing countries for the purpose of promoting their exchange of goods and services.”     The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.3 concerning criteria for the development of export potential in the developing countries. It notes, however, that recourse to certain of the financial, monetary, fiscal and other aids and incentives mentioned in paragraph 4 of Sub-Section II of Section B of the Recommendation might in certain circumstances give rise to the necessity of considering the application of countervailing duties. The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.5 concerning trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures. It wishes to record that it is among the countries mentioned in the fourth preambular paragraph of the Recommendation, which are opposed in principle to the extension of preferences by developing countries and which support instead the application of the most-favoured-nation principle in the extension of concessions by developed to developing countries. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.3 (Aims of international financial and technical co-operation). The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.13 concerning the needs of the public sector in the transfer of external resources to developing countries. The United States voted for the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 on continuing machinery, on the assumption that such machinery and the procedures to be developed under paragraph 25 of this Recommendation will be acceptable to the developed as well as the developing countries. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.V.2 concerning arrangements during the interim period before the establishment of continuing machinery. The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.V.3 concerning the terms of reference of subsidiary organs of the continuing machinery.

####Message from the President of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the President of the Conference

[Original: French] On behalf of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria and in my own name, I am happy to convey my greetings on the occasion of the historic event of the opening of the International Conference on Trade and Development held under the auspices of the United Nations. Algeria attaches the greatest importance to the work of this Conference, which may lead to the positive and lasting solution of the problems confronting the developing countries in particular. The organization of the economy of the world, which for so long has been characterized by domination, has led to an inequality of development that is becoming unfavourable to our peoples. Our task today is to seek with faith and determination the means whereby scientific and technical progress can be made to operate to the advantage of all. These means exist and are numerous and impressive; they comprise human knowledge, natural resources, agricultural and industrial products, capital etc. It will be the responsibility of the Conference to bring into operation the means and instruments for international economic co-operation on the basis of the principles of respect for the dignity of the human person, social justice and the right of every man and every people to a life of liberty and economic, social and cultural progress. It is hardly necessary for me to add that the realization of the conditions for a rapid rise in the standard of living of the peoples of the developing countries constitutes, after the total elimination of colonial rule and racial discrimination, the only way of ensuring a just and durable peace for mankind. On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, I send my best wishes for the success of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. AHMED BEN BELLA   

####Message from the President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon adderssed to the President of the Conference

[Original: French] People and Government of Cameroon and myself following with great interest historic meeting now being held Geneva to institute new system for international trade. In a world both too rich and too poor it was becoming urgently necessary that men of good will should consider difficult problems of their trade relations. At a time when man has conquered distance and overcome endemic diseases and infant mortality and when technical progress has opened up vast possibilities of every kind, it was inconceivable that a campaign should not be launched against the anachronistic imbalance in world economic relations. We firmly believe it was high time that the two worlds, on the one hand that of the countries with an embarrassing surplus of foodstuffs and of capital unable find appropriate use at home and on the other countries where hunger, poverty, ignorance, in short underdevelopment, prevail, should hold reasoned discussion. Like other underdeveloped countries Cameroon hopes that your deliberations will result in solutions enabling future to be faced with confidence and promoting harmonious development of all peoples. Highest esteem and consideration. AHIDJO   

####Message from His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Ethiopia addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: English] We extend our sincere best wishes for the succes of the Conference and we express the hope that your deliberations will result in the establishment of a new and fruitful basis for trade and economic relations between all peoples of the world. May the Almighty guide your effort in his wisdom. HAILE SELASSIE I   

####Message from the President of the Republic of Ghana addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: English] Please convey to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development my personal greetings and the best wishes of the Government and people of the Republic of Ghana. The nations of the world are meeting at a historic moment to consider ways and means of buttressing the hard-won political independence of developing countries with collective economic security within the framework of international trade. More than ever before, all nations must strive in the spirit of international co-operation to iron out the present inequities inherent in international trade to ensure an accelerated economic development and an integrated growth of all the economies of the whole world. May success attend your deliberations. KWAME NKRUMAH   

####Message from the President of the Republic of Guinea to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development

[Original: French] This Conference which I have the honour to greet on behalf of the Government and people of Guinea is one of exceptional importance. The peoples of the world, more especially those of the developing countries, are rightly turning their eyes and hopes towards Geneva where the delegations will be stating the views of their countries and placing before the conscience of the nations for action equitable solutions to the crucial problem of the harmonious and balanced development of the world economy, of which one of the decisive factors is the system of international trade. After the struggle for freedom, each people, in order to enhance its social and cultural values, inevitably embarks on a process of economic development; but it cannot achieve this alone and without the co-operation of other nations. The full satisfaction of the needs of man and of society call for economic, technical and financial means the judicious use of which by the physical, intellectual and moral capacities of man or of society must necessarily be in keeping with the level of man's and society's general development and with the objective of their action, which are interconnected. In other words, the speed of development is directly related to the quality and quantity of the means employed and to the ultimate objective. It is precisely because all nations do not possess the same natural, technical and financial resources that they are at present at different degrees of development. Any policy tending to perpetuate or widen this difference makes for greater inequality among the peoples and so favours the direct or indirect exploitations of some peoples by others. Are the developing countries making an effort inferior to that of the developed countries? We feel sure that the Conference will answer unanimously “No!” The quality of the means of production undoubtedly has a direct influence on the output and productivity of the worker. Moreover, the whole Conference will agree that the foreign rule endured by some countries for varying periods of time has seriously hampered their economic, social and cultural development. Although the attainment of political freedom is taking place at an encouraging speed it must be emphasized that in the case of most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, it has not been accompanied by economic freedom. The international terms of trade are in no way equitable. It is becoming increasingly clear to mankind that the world can be more accurately divided into rich nations that owe their wealth to their high degree of development and poor nations that owe their poverty to lack of development, than into groups with different ideologies. To solve the problem of the organization of international trade on equitable foundations such as would bring a just remuneration to the productive efforts of societies is undoubtedly one way of trying to contribute to the progress of the movement for peace throughout the world. Coming next in importance only after the freedom of nations, peace depends on the possibility offered to every people to satisfy all its material and moral needs by its work. The problem of disarmament yields in importance to the problem of the development of human societies. Furthermore, without under-estimating the nature and quality of the decisions which your Conference may reach, we venture to believe that any study concerning the operation of the system of international trade would remain partial and would yield piecemeal solutions if it does not include an examination of the structure and operation of markets with a view to bringing into existence a world organization of economic exchanges and financial relations among nations. We believe that your Conference, if it is to be equal to the responsibilities which it is assuming before history, will have to organize its discussions in such a way as to exclude any complex in the relations between the delegations of the developed nations and those of the, developing nations. For to start out from the idea that nations should give charity to other nations, or to be more precise, that the industrialized countries will have to lend their assistance in the development of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, would lead the discussions far beyond the requirements of the universal society whose harmonious and balanced development remains the only real factor for mutual understanding, reciprocal friendship and fraternal co-operation among the peoples. At this Conference, there are no givers and no receivers of gifts. There are only - and it cannot be otherwise - delegations authorized by their nations to study ways and means, of establishing fair relationships in trade transactions which are at present prejudicial to the interests of the great majority of the peoples of the globe and, consequently, to the strenghtening of the bases of world peace. We hope that a spirit of understanding and a determination to move forward will guide your deliberation and will bring them to a positive conclusion, for the benefit not of a part, but of the whole of human society, which has endured too much oppression and exploitation and which longs for a new life, a life in which each people can enjoy true political and economic freedom, security and peace. AHMED SÉKOU TOURÉ   

####Message from the President of India addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: English] The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which opens at Geneva on 23 March, sixteen years after the Havana Conference, is an event of great importance. The less developed countries, of which India is one, are looking hopefully to this Conference to find speedy and effective solutions to their problems of development. The United Nations have taken special interest in promoting the economic development of less developed countries, because poverty is a danger to world peace. It is of the utmost urgency and importance that the developed countries of the world assist others, not so fortunately placed, in the achievement of modest targets of development of the latter through concrete programmes. The prosperity and development of each will contribute to the prosperity of all. On behalf of India I send the Conference my sincere good wishes for its success. S. RADHAKRISHNAN   

####Message from the President of the Republic of Indonesia to the Conference

[Original: English] It gives me great pleasure to address a message to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which opens in Geneva on 23 March 1964. I welcome the initiative that has been taken by the United Nations in convening this Conference, and am gratified indeed by the fact that this initiative was prompted, among others, by the countries, including Indonesia, who are today engrossed in the task of national construction and development. The convening of this Conference signifies a growing awareness of the vital need to take effective measures to improve trade relations, to turn trade into an effective instrument for development instead of being a positive hindrance to development as is so frequently the case today. One of the Five Pillars of the Republic of Indonesia is Social Justice and by Social Justice we mean the construction of a society that is free of the exploitation of man by man. I recommend to this esteemed Conference to accept this Pillar of Social Justice as the guiding principle for your deliberations. Is is my deepest conviction that by adopting the framework of Social Justice in the larger context of world economic relationships, an unprecedented acceleration can be achieved in bridging the gap between developing and developed nations. In international relations, the implementation of Social Justice can lead to the termination of the exploitation of nation by nation, ending imperialist and colonialist relationship and making it possible for all nations to build up their economies in accordance with their own national interest, harnessing fully the potentials of their own people and exploiting fully their own natural resources, with the ultimate goal of general welfare for all mankind regardless, of rape, colour or creed. Furthermore, by so doing we will be able to keep pace with the tempo of “the revolution of rising demands” which is sweeping through the most remote corners of our shrinking world. I take this opportunity of ensuring you that Indonesia is looking forward to your deliberations with great expectations and is ready to make its contribution to such schemes as you may deem appropriate in pursuance of the common goal of Social Justice. I should like to add, however, that the main emphasis to the effort of each country, to its efforts to free itself from economic dependence and mobilize its own resources, is to rely on its own potentials. Indonesia warmly welcomes international cooperation and is conscious of the value of assistance from other countries, but international cooperation should start with the basic premise that those who cooperate rely first and foremost on their own resources. International assistance can even become a burden if it exceeds its function as an auxiliary or catalyst to a nation's own efforts. What is worse, international cooperation would deteriorate into a curse if it tended to retard the growth of a nation and perpetuate it bondage to outside assistance. The task today it to remove all those hindrances to national economic growth, above all by creating the necessary conditions for the promotion of equitable trade relations. Expanding trade stimulates growth, while growth stimulates trade, and once this process begins for all countries in the world there will be no bounds to the advancement of Man, to the riches he will create for the prosperity of all. I hope that these understandings will underline your deliberations, for this is the guarantee of success, this is the guarantee that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will be a landmark in the history of Mankind in the striving towards Prosperity and Social Justice. SUKARNO   

####Message from the Minister of Japan to the Conference

[Original: English] It is my conviction that the very fact that 121 nations of the world have gathered together to review and discuss the problem of North and South represents the wisdom of whole humanity. It is also my sincere hope that these joint efforts, if continued for coming years in the spirit of harmony and mutual understanding, will ultimately bring about successful results. HAYATO IKEDA   

####Message from the President of Liberia to the Conference

[Original: English] Greetings and best wishes from the Government, people of Liberia, and myself to all representatives assembled at this important Conference. May your contacts with each other and your deliberations on the lively and exciting issues of the imbalance in the relations between developed and developing nations, and in trade and commerce - with particular reference to primary finished and semifinished products, tariff preferences and so forth - be enriched by the measure of a proper sense of fairness and understanding so that your shared experiences and work together may enhance plans for evolving a new era of prosperity among all men and the reign of peace be achieved. WILLIAM V. S. TUBMAN   

####Message from the President and Government of Mali to the President of the Conference

Hopes Conference will transcend national selfishness and systems and work out salutary recommendations establishing just co-operation fertile for all peoples in accordance with hopes and inspiration of United Nations Charter. Highest consideration. MODIBO KEITA   

####Message from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic to the Conference

[Original: English] On the occasion of the opening of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, I send cordial greetings to the participants on behalf of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic and on my own behalf. Our Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the solution of such problems of international economic co-operation as the elimination of all forms of discrimination in international trade for political or other motives, the establishment and expansion of mutually advantageaous economic relations between all States, on a basis of equality, the drafting of effective measures to ensure the economic advancement of developing countries, and the creation of an international trade organization under the aegis of the United Nations, which would concern itself with all questions relating to world trade and would be open to all countries. The normalization of international trade is an important means pf relaxing international tension, putting an end to the cold war, strengthening peace and promoting the peaceful co-existence of States with aifierent spcial systems. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic endorses the principle of mutually advantageous international trade, which will bring peoples closer to one another and serve the cause of peace and the progress of all mankind. I wish the participants in the Conference every success in the attainment of the goals of the Conference. YU TSEDENBAL   

####Message dated 12 June 1964 from His Majesty the King of Morocco addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: French] Now that the Conference is approaching the end of its proceedings which we have followed with the closest attention, We take pleasure in offering you Our sincere congratulations on your unceasing efforts for its success and in expressing Our warmest hopes that specific and beneficial resolutions will emerge from the deliberations of this world-wide meeting. We are aware of the obstacles which confronted the Conference from the outset, of the numerous and complex questions with which it has had to deal and of the powerful interests that would be involved. It seemed scarcely likely therefore, that a general and final settlement of the difficult problems involved would be reached unanimously in the short time available to the participants. Accordingly We consider it all the more reassuring that the Conference was able to demonstrate so clearly that delegation realized to the full the farreaching nature of the problems which faced them and the need for just and humane solutions. In this respect the attitude of the developing countries has been of great significance, and the part they have played in the Conference has provided evidence of their maturity. While pressing their legitimate requests, those countries repeatedly affirmed their belief that development called for a sustained national effort on their part. No less remarkable was the attitude of the industrialized countries: instead of confining themselves to useless intransigence, they paid careful attention to the difficulties confronting the developing countries and have shown a sincere desire to promote their progress. Is is Our hope therefore that this rapprochement and this desire for co-operation will be the prelude to a general and irresistible movement that will translate into reality throughout the world the ideals of peace and brotherhood which are among Our foremost objectives. HASSA II   

####Message from His Majesty the King of Nepal, addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: English] It gives us considerable pleasure to have the opportunity to say a few words on this occasion. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development presently being attended by all the United Nations member countries, will no doubt find ways to overcome the trading difficulties of the developing countries. Developing countries' present and future development plans largely dependent as they are on their capacity to expand their foreign trade, we hope, the same will receive due consideration of the Conference and we also hope that the difficulties presently experienced by land-locked countries and their justified concern for unrestricted transit facilities will find satisfactory solution. The Conference, as it is one of the measure efforts of the United Nations to diffuse prosperity, will find general approbation and admiration of the people all over the world and in particular, of the people of the developing part of the world. We wish the Conference every success. MAHENDRA R.   

####Message from the President of Pakistan to the Conference

[Original: English] On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan and on my own behalf I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for its success. The importance of this gathering cannot be over-emphasised. Indeed since the founding of the United Nations there has been no other Conference on the outcome of which so much of the economic future and well being of humanity has depended. A large part of the world has pinned its hopes on the successful outcome of this Conference. The developing nations of the world are at the cross-roads of history and the future course they take will largely depend on how far this Conference adequately responds to their hopes and aspirations. The economic and trade problems of developing countries have been under study since a long time. The main difficulties, as well as possible remedies, have been identified. What is required now is the political will to evolve and implement an integrated programma of action. For a majority of the nations of the world economic progress is today another name for sheer survival. Pakistan, along with other developing nations of the world, is waiting to see how far the international community responds to the challenge of the times so that the appalling conditions in which vast masses of humanity live can be changed and a period of sustained progress leading to decent standards of living ensured within a reasonable future. MOHAMMAD AYUB KHAN   

####Message from the President of Peru addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: Spanish] At the opening of the World Conference at Geneva, I wish to express sincerest good wishes for the success of this important Conference, the most vital of whose objectives is to correct the imbalances which exist at present in the commercial exchanges of the developing countries with the highly industrialized countries and so to achieve a juster universal order guaranteeing general prosperity and lasting peace on the foundations of economic justice and social progress. FERNANDO BELAUNDE TERRY   

####Message from the President of the Republic of the Philippines to the Conference

[Original: English] Through the Delegation of the Republic of the Philippines to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which has just begun its massively important task, I greet the Honorable Conference President, Secretary-General and other Officers as well as all the Distinguished Delegates in attendance with the fervent hope that the Conference will not merely raise the expectations of two-thirds of humanity but make possible their reasonable fulfilment. It scarcely needs stating that the Conference, conceived as an earnest effort to assist the developing nations in improving their economies and enlarging their share of human wellbeing, has already boosted further the rising expectations of the peoples of Asia, Latin America and Africa. This is so, further, because gathered together in mutual counsel at the Palais des Nations in Geneva are the delegations of 122 nations which surely include in their ranks men and women possessed of the profoundest knowledge and experience in all phases of human uplift. If with this near-total mobilization of the world's human wisdom and statesmanship good will in commensurate measure also exists, failure is inconceivable. Failure is, indeed, unthinkable. Failure would plunge the developing nations into a new depth of hopelessness and frustration. Failure would earn for the developed nations the disappointment of two-thirds of the world. Failure would deal a fatal blow to the dwindling buying power of the developing nations. Failure would accelerate the progressive loss to the developed nations of their greatest potential markets. Enlightened self-interest on the part of both the developed and developing nations demands not failure but success. Looming before all the nations with the increasing brightness of the rising sun is the simple fact that human well-being is indivisible. Nuclear weapons have made war and peace and security indivisible. Continuous and speedy international intercourse has made human health and human expectations indivisible. Wealth and poverty cannot long exist side by side without wealth itself perishing. Wealth must abolish poverty or poverty will liquidate wealth. Human well-being must be for all humanity. Strongly believing that the Conference cannot but conceive an improved and enlightened basis of world economic co-operation, I warmly commend those who conceived it in the councils of the United Nations, wish Godspeed to those who are charged with its management and leadership, and offer my prayers that the distinguished delegates will carry on and conclude their vital task with historic vision and wisdom.

####Message from the President of the Council of State of the Romanian People's Republic, to the Conference

[Original: French] Permit me on behalf of the Council of State of the Romanian People's Republic, the Romanian people, and on my own behalf to transmit to you and to all participants best wishes for the complete success of the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The Romanian Government sees in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development an important event in the activity of the United Nations, an important event in contemporary international life, which concerns all countries in all regions of the world. The Romanian Government hopes that the work of this Conference will contribute to finding the most suitable methods of converting international trade into an efficacious instrument for the economic progress of all countries, and, primarily, the progress of the developing countries. Mankind now has at its disposal huge material resources which, together with unexampled advances in science, truly offer opportunities for banishing from our planet economic under-development, the source of poverty, illiteracy and disease. In order that these opportunities may become realities within the reach of all people and every country an end must be put to the armaments race, general and complete disarmament must be achieved, and action must be taken to implement the decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations concerning the immediate liquidation of colonialism in every form. The restrictions and discriminations which impede and distort international economic relations, and especially the trade relations of the developing countries, must be eliminated. International trade must revert to its true functions, its true character, that of a factor for peaceful, mutually advantageous exchanges, contributing to a better understanding among the peoples and to the maintenance of peace. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is expected to make its contribution towards the achievement of these aims, and so to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of millions and millions of human beings in all regions of the world. With these considerations in mind, the Romanian Government has attached special attention to the preparation of Romania's participation it the Conference's work. As you know, the Romanian delegation at the sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations and on other occasions have warmly supported the idea and have stressed the need for convening this Conference. Actuated by the wish to make its contribution to the establishment of an agenda covering the most important problems of a broad and unimpeded development of international trade, the Romanian Government has prepared certain proposals of general interest, based on the positive experience of international economic relations and requiremeats. We hope that these proposals will be considered during the Conference's debates with all due attention, together with the constructive proposals of other countries. Romania is interested in the establishment of normal economic relations among States and considers that such relations should be based on the principles of strict respect for national sovereignty, the equality of rights, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual advantage. The Romanian Government has always considered, and still considers, that the United Nations has an important part to play in this matter and, in conformity with the fundamental terms of the Charter, should promote measures tending to contribute to the expansion of international economic co-operation, to economic development and to the raising of levels of living throughout the world. For this purpose, Romania has, since the twelfth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, been advocating the preparation of a declaration on the principles of international economic co-operation. At its last session the General Assembly of the United Nations endorsed the idea that such a declaration might be an effective instrument for the establishment of stable, sound and equitable relations among all States. The Romanian Government hopes that the deliberations of the Conference will proceed in a spirit of understanding and co-operation and that they will approach the modern problems of international trade and economic development realistically and constructively, taking into consideration the profound changes which have occurred! in the world and recognizing that all countries have the right to economic and social development.

####Message from the President of the Tunisian Republic to the Conference

[Original: French] The evolution of the modern world, characterised by spectacular advances in science and technology and, secondly, by the ending of the colonial era and by the liberation of productive forces long enslaved to the purposes of exploitation, opens up the broadest prospects for trade and international economic co-operation. Trade has been from time immemorial an instrument for the exchange of wealth and skills among the peoples, but it has nowadays become the means by which every economy is nourished and breathes and the living expression of a profound solidarity of interests among men, irrespective of their mode of life and their political and social system. Consequently, it is the responsibility of the United Nations to organize international trade in conformity with the purposes and principles of its Charter and so to correct the imbalances and inequalities inherited from an anachronistic system unsuited to the spirit of our time. It is a task necessary for the maintenance of peace and for the strengthening of co-operation and friendship among the peoples. Tunisia has at all times, and with conviction and unreservedly, supported the activities of the United Nations and is once again ready to make its contribution, however modest, to the common effort. It trusts sincerely that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will not disappoint the hopes of the developing countries, which are genuinely anxious to find the formula for a balanced and harmonious co-operation working to the mutual advantage of all nations. On behalf of the people and Government of Tunisia and on my own behalf I express the sincerest wishes for the full success of your deliberations. HABIB BOURGUIBA   

####Message from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics addressed to the President of the Conference

[Original: Russian] On behalf of the Soviet Government and on my own behalf I extend cordial greetings to the participants in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The Soviet Government expresses its gratification at the opening of this Conference, the convening of which was due in part to the initiative of the Soviet Union. We are glad that the idea of convening the Conference met with such wide support throughout the world particularly on the part of the developing countries, and that it has now become a reality. We are convinced that trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is a good basis for the peaceful co-existence of countries with different social systems and creates favourable conditions for the further relaxation of international tension and the consolidation of peace throughout the world. Our era is characterized by the desire of the independence States of Asia, Africa and Latin America to put an end to economic backwardness in the shortest possible time and to achieve progress in all spheres of human endeavour. International trade and economic co-operation, based on respect of sovereignty and a desire to take into account the vital needs of the developing countries, will be an excellent addition to the efforts made by those countries to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism in their economy and foreign trade and to raise the level of their independent national economy. It is common knowledge that the present state of world trade fails in many respects to fulfil the great hopes which the peoples of the world place in it. The inequitable international division of labour and the constantly widening gap between the prices of the goods exported by the developing countries and the prices of the goods imported by them, which is causing depletion of their resources and hampering their development, are the result of imperialist exploitation. Discrimination and artificial barriers check the growth of international trade and poison the political atmosphere. As regards the Soviet Union, it is consistently pursuing the policy of developing trade and economic relations with all countries of the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Evidence of this is the steady growth of the foreign trade of the USSR. We shall continue in future to devote great attention to the development of trade and economic co-operation with all countries which are interested in this, and in particular with the developing countries. As participants in this extremely important Conference, you are faced with important and noble tasks, namely, to secure better conditions for the development of world trade on the basis of equitable principles, which would help to normalize trade, to eliminate artificial barriers and discrimination, and to ensure all countries an appropriate place in the international division of labour, as well as to work out practical measures for the expansion of international trade and economic co-operation, and to set up effective organizational machinery with a view to the earliest possible implementation of the resolutions of the Conference. This requires a bold, just and unprejudiced approach to the solution of the problems confronting the Conference. The Soviet Government convinced that trade and economic cooperation between peoples can and must make an enormous contribution to the strengthening of peace and co-operation among peoples, wishes the Conference every success and expresses the hope that it will open a new page in the history of international economic relations. N. KHRUSHCHEV   

####Message from the President of the United Arab Republic to the Conference

[Original: English] On the occasion of the meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development I am happy to convey to the honourable representatives - in the name of the people and Government of the United Arab Republic - my best wishes for the success of the Conference. It is gratifying that the reorganization of the international economy to make it more compatible with the needs of our times - which is the burden entrusted to your Conference - has become the subject of general agreement. There is no doubt that it is important to all countries of the world, irrespective of their stage of development or their economic system that this Conference is successful, since its success will pave the way for new horizons of constructive co-operation between all nations for the realization of peace, justice and international economic progress. The great economic and social problems which face the world at present must be solved on an equitable basis; and international organizations are expected to use all their efforts for this purpose and to go through the process of evolution which might be necessary to enable them to carry their new responsibilities. International economic co-operation for the common prosperity of all the peoples of the world is an inevitable necessity for the cause of peace and progress of humanity. The people of the United Arab Republic - with their intentions, supported by action - extend their hands in a spirit of international co-operation to all countries and across all oceans.

####Message from the President of the United States of America to the Conference

[Original: English] The great task of our time is to bring the fruits of economic well-being to all peoples in a world of peace and freedom. The nations of the world have gathered in Geneva for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to discuss together how to move ahead in accomplishing this task. On behalf of the people and Government of the United States of America, I hereby pledge our strongest co-operation in this great joint endeavour. LYNDON B. JOHNSON   

####Message from the President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Addressed to the Conference

[Original: English] I take great pleasure in extending to the participants of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development best wishes for successful work on behalf of the people and the Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Your assembly constitutes an event of extraordinary importance for international relations and it gives rise to great hopes that the international community will be capable of creating better conditions for general progress of the world and, in particular, for an accelerated economic growth of developing countries. The Conference will thereby make a major contribution to the improvement of world situation and preservation of peace as well. We are firmly convinced that the economic development and social progress of all countries are of common interest of the international community as a whole, and as such is a matter of common concern and responsibility of all. Your Conference is faced with a major task of undertaking effective measures in a more organized and comprehensive manner, with the aim of promoting universal and equal economic co-operation in order to accelerate economic development in the world and to eliminate the existing obstacles impeding international economic co-operation and stabilization of situation in the world. General concurrence of all countries on the need and usefulness of having this Conference convened, is, no doubt, encouraging. Furthermore, it offers sound basis for hopes placed in it. The prevailing international relations, as demonstrated, did not make possible the solving of a number of outstanding problems. One of these major problems, by all standards, is the unequal development in the world and its impact upon the international relations. This problem, in a greater measure, constitutes a key problem not only to the further progress of insufficiently developed areas, but, we are firmly convinced, to the further prosperity of the industrially developed countries as well. The rapid economic and social development of those countries which have only recently gained their independence, permitting them to integrate themselves into international economic co-operation on an equal footing, is a matter of immediate urgency. An effective international action, which does not brook delay, is necessary towards this end. Likewise, the elimination of various obstacles standing in the way of broad international co-operation, will, no doubt, in addition to yielding economic gains contribute considerably towards improved relations among nations and States in general. We are convinced that all countries feel that it is in their own interest to exert the necessary efforts towards the resolving of problems facing this Conference. We sincerely hope that the recommendations and decisions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will pay due attention to the interest of all countries, irrespective of the level of development and differences in the social and economic systems and that they will constitute a genuine contribution to the promoting of international co-operation and the safeguarding of peace.

<sup> 1  E/CONF. 46/L.17 of 12 June 1964.  </sup> 
###POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE BETWEEN THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

In connexion with the wishes expressed by delegations of the developing countries to be informed of more concrete perspective data on eventual increase of turnover between the USSR and the developing countries the Soviet Delegation hereby informs that according to estimates made by Soviet economists trade between the USSR and the developing countries under proper conditions may increase during next 17 years as follows (as compared to 1963):  

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | unit  | 1963  | 1970  | 1980  |
| Total turnover  | million rubles  | 1.480  | 3.300  | over 10.000  |
| --- | Import of some tropical commodities from the developing countries  | --- |
| Coca-beans  | Thousand tons  | 54  | 120  | 350  |
| Coffee  | „ „  | 29.1  | 60  | 120  |
| Citrus  | „ „  | 60.2  | 180  | 750  |
| Coconut oil, palm oil and other oils for confecionery an perfumery industries (in quantities of oil seeds)  | „ „  | 212  | 300  | 1000  |

At the same time the USSR will increase import from the developing countries of cotton fibre, jute, wool, tea, bananas, pineapples, spices, and certain products of mining industry and primary products for chemical industry. The purchases in the developing countries of manufactures and semi-manufactures under trade agreements, including repayment of credits granted by the Soviet Union to these countries, shall also be increased. The Soviet Delegation has no objections to include the provided figures into the Final Act of the Conference. At the same time the Delegation wishes to have in the Final Act or in other resolution adopted by the Conference the following wording in connexion with the above figures: 

“The conference recognizes that trade with the socialist countries is of considerable benefit to the growth of world trade and maintains that such trade can substantially contribute to the growth of export earnings of the developing countries.”  

“The Conference welcomes the intentions of the socialist countries to annually increase trade with the developing countries and welcomes the data provided by a number of delegations of the socialist countries as trade development estimates for 1970 and 1980.”  

“It is understood by the Conference that the statement of a number of delegations of the socialist countries on eventual development of trade reflects the aims of these countries and that the increase of imports of socialist countries from the developing countries should be accompanied by the rise in purchases of the developing countries in socialist countries as well as by the general normalization of world trade.”  

“The Conference notes the readiness of the socialist countries to enter into multilateral as well as bilateral trade agreements including long-term ones when it appears economically advantageous for the trade partners concerned and welcomes the readiness of the socialist countries to gradually facilitate the transferability of credit balances.”   
### *CZECHOSLOVAKIA* 

To meet the request of some delegations of developing countries, the delegation of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic decided to make known - as far as it is possible to express them in comprehensive figures - the objectives of Czechoslovakia's trade policy concerning developing countries. 

1. The total turnover will be in 1970 approximately doubled so that it is expected to reach about US 900 mil. This increase of turnover includes corresponding increase of imports of raw materials, foodstuffs, as well as manufactures and semi-manufactures.  

2. The imports of tropical fruits will be almost trebled in 1970.  

3. The imports of coffee, cocoa and foodstuffs will be approximately doubled in 1970.   The Czechoslovak delegation would agree to the inclusion of these data into the Final Act of the Conference, provided that the Final Act in this connexion will contain the statement, the wording of which is given in the last four paragraphs of the USSR Aide-Memoire and to which the Czechoslovak delegation fully subscribe. 
### *HUNGARY* 

Referring to the Aide Memoire of the USSR Delegation of June 10th, regarding more concrete perspective data on the eventual increase of turnover with the developing countries, the Hungarian Delegation wishes to inform you hereby on the concrete perspective data concerning the eventual growth of trade between Hungary and the developing countries. These data for Hungary are the following:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | 1963  | 1970  |
| total turnover in Million $  | 160  | 310  |

In respect to the above data, the Hungarian Delegation wishes to express that these are to be understood according to the text of the above mentioned Aide Memoire of the USSR. Moreover, the Hungarian Delegation wishes to stress that she fully agrees with the contents of the Aide Memoire of the USSR. 
### *POLAND* 

In connexion with the discussion regarding the inclusion into the Final Act of the estimates relating to the possible future development of trade between the socialist and the developing countries the Polish Delegation presents the following estimates of import possibilities of the Polish People's Republic from developing countries in 1970.  

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | Unit $ million  | 1963  | 1970  |
| Imports of selected commodities exported by developing countries  | Thousand tons  | 125  | 300  |
| Cocoa beans  | --- | 11.6  | 25  |
| Coffee  | --- | 8.7  | 19  |

<sup>1)</sup> 1962, total imports. <sup>2)</sup> Total imports. In addition to this it is estimated that during the said period imports of natural rubber will increase 2.6 times, those of raw hides - 2 times and those of textile fibres by 30 per cent. Considerable increases in imports of other primary commodities as well as semi-manufactured and manufactured goods are also expected. It is understood, of course, that these figures reflect the forecast of a continuing growth of Polish exports.
