2.  Each State Party shall provide at the signature of this Treaty notification to all other States Parties of the maximum levels for its holdings of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty. The notification of the maximum levels for holdings of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty provided by each State Party at the signature of this Treaty shall remain valid until the date specified in a subsequent notification pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article.   
3.  In accordance with the limitations set forth in Articles IV, V and VI, each State Party shall have the right to change the maximum levels for its holdings of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty. Any change in the maximum levels for holdings of a State Party shall be notified by that State Party to all other States Parties at least 90 days in advance of the date, specified in the notification, on which such a change takes effect. In order not to exceed any of the limitations set forth in Articles IV and V, any increase in the maximum levels for holdings of a State Party that would otherwise cause those limitations to be exceeded shall be preceded or accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the previously notified maximum levels for holdings of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty of one or more States Parties belonging to the same group of States Parties. The notification of a change in the maximum levels for holdings shall remain valid from the date specified in the notification until the date specified in a subsequent notification of change pursuant to this paragraph.

6.  A decrease in the numbers of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty held by a State Party and subject to notification pursuant to the Protocol on Information Exchange shall by itself confer no right on any other State Party to increase the maximum levels for its holdings subject to notification pursuant to this Article.   
7.  It shall be the responsibility solely of each individual State Party to ensure that the maximum levels for its holdings notified pursuant to the provisions of this Article are not exceeded. States Parties belonging to the same group of States Parties shall consult in order to ensure that the maximum levels for holdings notified pursuant to the provisions of this Article, taken together as appropriate, do not exceed the limitations set forth in Articles IV, V and VI.

3.  Conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty shall be deemed to be reduced upon execution of the procedures set forth in the Protocols listed in paragraph 1 of this Article and upon notification as required by these Protocols. Armaments and equipment so reduced shall no longer be counted against the numerical limitations set forth in Articles IV, V and VI.   
4.  Reductions shall be effected in three phases and completed no later than 40 months after entry into force of this Treaty, so that: 

(A) by the end of the first reduction phase, that is, no later than 16 months after entry into force of this Treaty, each State Party shall have ensured that at least 25 percent of its total reduction liability in each of the categories of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty has been reduced;  

(B) by the end of the second reduction phase, that is, no later than 28 months after entry into force of this Treaty, each State Party shall have ensured that at least 60 percent of its total reduction liability in each of the categories of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty has been reduced;  

(C) by the end of the third reduction phase, that is, no later than 40 months after entry into force of this Treaty, each State Party shall have reduced its total reduction liability in each of the categories of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty.

5.  Conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty to be reduced shall have been declared present within the area of application in the exchange of information at signature of this Treaty.   
6.  No later than 30 days after entry into force of this Treaty, each State Party shall provide notification to all other States Parties of its reduction liability.   
7.  Except as provided for in paragraph 8 of this Article, a State Party's reduction liability in each category shall be no less than the difference between its holdings notified, in accordance with the Protocol on Information Exchange, at signature or effective upon entry into force of this Treaty, whichever is the greater, and the maximum levels for holdings it notified pursuant to Article VII.   
8.  Any subsequent revision of a State Party's holdings notified pursuant to the Protocol on Information Exchange or of its maximum levels for holdings notified pursuant to Article VII shall be reflected by a notified adjustment to its reduction liability. Any notification of a decrease in a State Party's reduction liability shall be preceded or accompanied by either a notification of a corresponding increase in holdings not exceeding the maximum levels for holdings notified pursuant to Article VII by one or more States Parties belonging to the same group of States Parties, or a notification of a corresponding increase in the reduction liability of one or more such States Parties.   
9.  Upon entry into force of this Treaty, each State Party shall notify all other States Parties, in accordance with the Protocol on Information Exchange, of the locations of its reduction sites, including those where the final conversion of battle tanks and armoured combat vehicles for non-military purposes will be carried out.   
10.  Each State Party shall have the right to designate as many reduction sites as it wishes, to revise without restriction its designation of such sites and to carry out reduction and final conversion simultaneously at a maximum of 20 sites.

1.  Armoured infantry fighting vehicles held by organisations of a State Party designed and structured to perform in peacetime internal security functions, which are not structured and organised for ground combat against an external enemy, are not limited by this Treaty. The foregoing notwithstanding, in order to enhance the implementation of this Treaty and to provide assurance that the number of such armaments held by such organisations shall not be used to circumvent the provisions of this Treaty, any such armaments in excess of 1,000 armoured infantry fighting vehicles assigned by a State Party to organisations designed and structured to perform in peacetime internal security functions shall constitute a portion of the permitted levels specified in Articles IV, V and VI. No more than 600 such armoured infantry fighting vehicles of a State Party, assigned to such organisations, may be located in that part of the area of application described in Article V, paragraph 1, subparagraph (A).

2.  A State Party shall not interfere with national or multinational technical means of verification of another State Party operating in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.   
3.  A State Party shall not use concealment measures that impede verification of compliance with the provisions of this Treaty by national or multinational technical means of verification of another State Party operating in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. This obligation does not apply to cover or concealment practices associated with normal personnel training, maintenance or operations involving conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty.

However, no State Party shall conduct more than five inspections annually pursuant to Sections VII and VIII of this Protocol of another State Party belonging to the same group of States Parties. Any such inspections shall count against the passive declared site inspection quota of the State Party being inspected. It shall otherwise be the responsibility solely of each group of States Parties to determine the allocation of inspections for each State Party within its group of States Parties. Each State Party shall notify to all other States Parties its active inspection quota: 

(A) for the baseline validation period, no later than 120 days after signature of the Treaty;  

(B) for the first year of the reduction period, no later than 60 days after entry into force of the Treaty; and

### Artikel  VII  

1.  Opdat de beperkingen genoemd in de artikelen IV, V en VI niet worden overschreden mag geen enkele Partij, na het verstrijken van 40 maanden na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, de maximumaantallen voor haar bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen overschrijden die zij eerder binnen haar groep van Partijen is overeengekomen in overeenstemming met het zevende lid van dit artikel en die zij ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel heeft bekendgemaakt.   
2.  Elke Partij maakt bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag aan alle andere Partijen de maximumaantallen bekend voor haar bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen. De bekendmaking van de maximumaantallen voor bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen die elke Partij bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag afgeeft, blijft geldig tot de datum aangegeven in een daaropvolgende bekendmaking ingevolge het derde lid van dit artikel.   
3.  In overeenstemming met de beperkingen genoemd in de artikelen IV, V en VI heeft elke Partij het recht haar maximumaantallen voor bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen te veranderen. Veranderingen in de maximumaantallen van een Partij worden door die Partij bekendgemaakt aan alle andere Partijen ten minste 90 dagen voor de in de bekendmaking aangegeven datum waarop deze verandering ingaat. Ten einde de beperkingen genoemd in de artikelen IV en V niet te overschrijden, dienen vergrotingen van de maximumaantallen van een Partij die ertoe zouden kunnen leiden dat deze beperkingen worden overschreden, te worden voorafgegaan door of vergezeld van een overeenkomstige vermindering van de eerder bekendgemaakte maximumaantallen voor bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen van een of meer Partijen behorend tot dezelfde groep van Partijen. De bekendmaking van een verandering in de maximumaantallen blijft geldig vanaf de in de bekendmaking aangegeven datum tot de datum aangegeven in een daaropvolgende bekendmaking van een verandering ingevolge dit lid.   
4.  Elke ingevolge het tweede of derde lid van dit artikel vereiste bekendmaking voor pantsergevechtsvoertuigen omvat tevens de maximumaantallen voor pantserinfanteriegevechtsvoertuigen en zwaarbewapende gevechtsvoertuigen van de Partij die de bekendmaking afgeeft.   
5.

6.  Een verkleining van de aantallen bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen die een Partij bezit en die zijn onderworpen aan bekendmaking ingevolge het Protocol inzake informatieuitwisseling verleent op zichzelf een andere Partij niet het recht haar maximumaantallen die zijn onderworpen aan bekendmaking ingevolge dit artikel te vergroten.   
7.  Het is de uitsluitende verantwoordelijkheid van elke afzonderlijke Partij te verzekeren dat de maximumaantallen die ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn bekendgemaakt, niet worden overschreden. Partijen behorend tot dezelfde groep van Partijen plegen overleg ten einde te verzekeren dat de maximumaantallen die ingevolge de bepalingen van dit artikel zijn bekendgemaakt, te zamen genomen, de in de artikelen IV, V en VI genoemde beperkingen niet overschrijden.

5.  In het kader van de uitwisseling van informatie bij de ondertekening van dit Verdrag wordt opgegeven wat er in het toepassingsgebied aanwezig is wat betreft bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen die moeten worden verminderd.   
6.  Uiterlijk 30 dagen na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag maakt elke Partij haar verminderingsverplichting aan alle andere Partijen bekend.   
7.  Tenzij anders is bepaald in het achtste lid van dit artikel, is de verminderingsverplichting van een Partij in elke categorie niet kleiner dan het verschil tussen de, in overeenstemming met het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling, bekendgemaakte aantallen die zij bezit bij ondertekening of op het tijdstip van inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag, naar gelang van welke het grootst zijn, en de maximumaantallen zoals bekendgemaakt ingevolge artikel VII.   
8.  Elke latere herziening van de aantallen van een Partij, bekendgemaakt ingevolge het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling, dan wel van haar maximumaantallen, bekendgemaakt ingevolge artikel VII, komt tot uitdrukking in een bekend te maken aanpassing van haar verminderingsverplichting. Elke bekendmaking van een verlaging van de verminderingsverplichting van een Partij dient te worden voorafgegaan door of vergezeld te gaan van hetzij een bekendmaking van een overeenkomstige vergroting van de aantallen van één of meer Partijen die tot dezelfde groep van Partijen behoren, mits deze de ingevolge artikel VII bekendgemaakte maximumaantallen niet overschrijden, hetzij een bekendmaking van een overeenkomstige verhoging van de verminderingsverplichting van één of meer van deze Partijen.   
9.  Bij de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag maakt elke Partij aan alle andere Partijen in overeenstemming met het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling de ligging van haar verminderingsplaatsen bekend, waaronder de plaatsen waar de uiteindelijke conversie van gevechtstanks en pantsergevechtsvoertuigen voor niet-militaire doeleinden zal plaatsvinden.   
10.  Elke Partij heeft het recht zoveel verminderingsplaatsen aan te wijzen als zij wenst, de aanwijzing van bedoelde plaatsen onbeperkt te herzien en de vermindering en de definitieve conversie gelijktijdig uit te voeren op maximaal 20 plaatsen. Partijen hebben het recht, in onderlinge overeenstemming, gezamenlijk gebruik te maken van verminderingsplaatsen of deze op één punt te situeren.   
11.  Onverminderd het tiende lid van dit artikel mag gedurende het aanvangsinventarisatietijdvak, dat wil zeggen het tijdvak tussen de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag en 120 dagen na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, per Partij in ten hoogste twee verminderingsplaatsen tegelijk tot vermindering worden overgegaan.   
12.  De vermindering van bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen geschiedt in verminderingsplaatsen binnen het toepassingsgebied, tenzij in de Protocollen genoemd in het eerste lid van dit artikel anders is bepaald.   
13.  Het verminderingsproces, met inbegrip van de resultaten van de conversie van bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen voor niet-militaire doeleinden, is zowel gedurende het verminderingstijdvak, als in de 24 maanden na het verminderingstijdvak, onderworpen aan inspectie, zonder recht van weigering, in overeenstemming met het Protocol inzake inspectie.

### 2  

In het geval van conventionele wapensystemen, in dienst bij de conventionele strijdkrachten van een Partij, die in het toepassingsgebied buiten het eigen grondgebied zijn gestationeerd, dragen de ontvangende Partij en de stationerende Partij, ter nakoming van hun onderscheiden verplichtingen, gezamenlijk zorg voor de inachtneming van de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit Protocol. De stationerende Partij is volledig verantwoordelijk voor de nakoming van de door het Verdrag opgelegde verplichtingen met betrekking tot haar conventionele wapensystemen die in dienst zijn bij haar conventionele strijdkrachten die op het grondgebied van de ontvangende Partij zijn gestationeerd.  

### 3  

Het begeleidingsteam valt onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de geïnspecteerde Partij: 

A. in het geval van inspectieplaatsen waar zich uitsluitend bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen van een stationerende Partij bevinden die onder het bevel van die Partij staan, valt het begeleidingsteam voor de duur van de inspectie op die inspectieplaats waar zich bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen van de stationerende Partij bevinden, onder de verantwoordelijkheid van een vertegenwoordiger van de stationerende Partij; en  

B. in het geval van inspectieplaatsen waar zich bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen bevinden van zowel de ontvangende Partij als de stationerende Partij., bestaat het begeleidingsteam uit vertegenwoordigers van beide Partijen wanneer daadwerkelijk bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen van de stationerende Partij worden geïnspecteerd. Tijdens de inspectie op die inspectieplaats oefent de ontvangende Staat de rechten en verplichtingen uit van de geïnspecteerde Partij, met uitzondering van de rechten en verplichtingen die verband houden met de inspectie van bij het Verdrag beperkte conventionele wapensystemen van de stationerende Partij; die rechten en verplichtingen oefent de stationerende Partij uit.    

### 4  

Indien een inspectieteam verzoekt om toegang tot opstallen of terreinen die worden gebruikt door een andere Partij opgrond van een akkoord met de geïnspecteerde Partij, oefent die andere Partij, in samenwerking met de geïnspecteerde Partij en voor zover zulks verenigbaar is met het akkoord inzake het gebruik, de in dit Protocol neergelegde rechten en verplichtingen uit met betrekking tot inspecties betreffende wapensystemen die toebehoren aan de Partij, die de opstallen of terreinen gebruikt.  

### 5  

Opstallen of terreinen die door een andere Partij worden gebruikt op grond van een akkoord met de geïnspecteerde Partij zijn slechts aan inspectie onderworpen wanneer een vertegenwoordiger van die andere Partij deel uitmaakt van het begeleidingsteam.

### 9  

De reiskosten van een inspectieteam tot aan het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek vóór een inspectie en vanaf het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek na voltooiing van de laatste inspectie worden gedragen door de inspecterende Partij.  

### 10  

Elke Partij is verplicht een aantal inspecties uit hoofde van Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol te dulden, welk aantal niet groter mag zijn dan haar passieve quotum voor inspecties op opgegeven inspectieplaatsen in elk van de volgende tijdvakken: een 120 dagen durendaanvangsinventarisatietijdvak, een drie jaar durend verminderingstijdvak, een 120 dagen durend restinventarisatietijdvak en een resttijdyak dat duurt zolang het Verdrag van kracht is. De passieve quota voor inspecties in opgegeven inspectieplaatsen worden per tijdvak vastgesteld als percentage van de verificatie-objecten van een Partij binnen het toepassingsgebied van het Verdrag, met uitzondering van verminderingsplaatsen en certificerings plaatsen:

### 15  

Het aantal inspecties van verificatie-objecten uit hoofde van Titel VII van dit Protocol binnen een bepaald tijdvak op het grondgebied van een Partij wordt berekend als percentage van het totale aantal verificatie-objecten die zich op het grondgebied van die Partij bevinden.  

### 16  

Een inspectie uit hoofde van Titel VIII van dit Protocol binnen een gespecificeerd gebied telt mee als één inspectie voor het passieve quotum voor verrassingsinspecties en als één inspectie voor het passieve quotum voor inspecties op opgegeven inspectieplaatsen van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de inspectie wordt gehouden.  

### 17  

Tenzij anders is overeengekomen tussen het begeleidingsteam en het inspectieteam, duurt de verblijfsperiode van een inspectieteam, met een maximum van in totaal 10 dagen, niet langer dan het totale aantal uren berekend aan de hand van de volgende formule:

Een Partij mag evenwel per jaar niet meer dan vijf inspecties ingevolge de Titels VII en VIII houden ten aanzien van een andere Partij die tot dezelfde groep van Partijen behoort. Deze inspecties tellen mee voor het passieve quotum voor inspecties op opgegeven inspectieplaatsen van de geïnspecteerde Partij. Overigens is elke groep van Partijen als enige verantwoordelijk voor de toewijzing van inspecties aan elke Partij binnen de groep van Partijen.

Het begeleidingsteam wacht het inspectieteam en de bemanningsleden op bij aankomst op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek.  

### 2  

Een Partij die op grond van een akkoord met de geïnspecteerde Partij opstallen en terreinen gebruikt, wijst een contactambtenaar aan voor het begeleidingsteam, die desgewenst beschikbaar is op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek om het inspectieteam te allen tijde, in overleg met het begeleidingsteam, te kunnen begeleiden:  

### 3  

De tijdstippen van aankomst en terugkomst op een punt van binnenkomst/vertrek worden overeengekomen en vastgelegd door zowel het inspectieteam als het begeleidingsteam.  

### 4  

De Partij op het grondgebied waarvan een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd, ziet erop toe dat de bagage, uitrusting en voorraden van het inspectieteam zijn vrijgesteld van douanerechten en dat deze snel worden behandeld op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek.  

### 5  

De uitrusting en voorraden die de inspecterende Partij op het grondgebied brengt van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd, worden telkens wanneer deze op dat grondgebied worden gebracht, aan een controle onderworpen. De controle moet zijn voltooid vóór het vertrek van het inspectieteam van het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek naar de inspectieplaats. De uitrusting en voorraden worden gecontroleerd door het begeleidingsteam in aanwezigheid van de leden van het inspectieteam.  

### 6  

Indien het begeleidingsteam bij de controle vaststelt dat een voorwerp dat deel uitmaakt van de door inspecteurs meegebrachte uitrusting of voorraden functies kan verrichten die niet stroken met de inspectievereisten van dit Protocol of die niet voldoen aan de vereisten uiteengezet in Titel VI, paragraaf 15, van dit Protocol, heeft het begeleidingsteam het recht de toestemming tot gebruik van het voorwerp te weigeren en dit in bewaring te nemen op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek. De inspecterende Partij verwijdert deze in bewaring genomen uitrusting of voorraden van het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd bij de eerstvolgende gelegenheid die zich naar haar goeddunken voordoet, doch niet later dan het tijdstip waarop het inspectieteam die de in bewaring genomen uitrusting of voorraden heeft meegebracht, het grondgebied verlaat.  

### 7  

Indien een Partij de controle van de uitrusting van een inspectieteam op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek niet heeft bijgewoond, is die Partij gerechtigd de rechten van het begeleidingsteam ingevolge de paragrafen 5 en 6 van deze Titel uit te oefenen vóór de inspectie op een opgegeven inspectieplaats waar haar conventionele strijdkrachten zich bevinden, of van opstallen of terreinen die zij gebruikt op grond van een akkoord met de geïnspecteerde Partij.  

### 8  

Gedurende de gehele periode waarin het inspectieteam en de bemanningsleden verblijven op het grondgebied van de Partij waar de inspectieplaats is gelegen, verzorgt of regelt de geïnspecteerde Partij de verschaffing van maaltijden, onderdak, werkruimte, vervoer en, indien nodig, het bieden van medische verzorging of enige andere noodhulp.  

### 9  

De Partij op het grondgebied waarvan een inspectie wordt uitgevoerd, draagt zorg voor de stalling, de beveiliging, het onderhoud en de brandstof voor de vervoermiddelen van de inspecterende Partij op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek.  

### TITEL  VI  

####ALGEMENE REGELS VOOR HET HOUDEN VAN INSPECTIES

Een inspectieteam kan naast inspecteurs van de inspecterende Partij mede inspecteurs van andere Partijen omvatten.  

### 2  

Bij inspecties in overeenstemming met de Titels VII, VIII, IX en X van dit Protocol bestaat een inspectieteam uit ten hoogste negen inspecteurs en kan het worden opgesplitst in ten hoogste drie subteams. In geval van gelijktijdige inspecties op het grondgebied van Partijen die geen militaire districten hebben als bedoeld in de artikelen IV en V van het Verdrag, of in één van de militaire districten van een Partij die zulke militaire districten heeft, mag slechts één inspectieteam worden opgesplitst in drie subteams en de andere in twee.  

### 3  

De inspecteurs en de leden van het begeleidingsteam dragen duidelijke herkenningstekenen waardoor zij als zodanig te onderscheiden zijn.  

### 4  

Een inspecteur wordt geacht zijn/haar taken te hebben aangevangen bij aankomst op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd, en wordt geacht die taken te hebben beëindigd bij het verlaten van het grondgebied van die Partij via het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek.  

### 5  

Het aantal bemanningsleden mag niet groter zijn dan 10.  

### 6  

Onverminderd hun voorrechten en immuniteiten eerbiedigen de inspecteurs en bemanningsleden de wetten en voorschriften van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan een inspectie wordt uitgevoerd en laten zij zich niet in met de binnenlandse aangelegenheden van die Partij. Inspecteurs en bemanningsleden nemen ook de voorschriften op een inspectieplaats in acht, waaronder de veiligheidsprocedures en administratieve procedures. Wanneer de geïnspecteerde Partij van oordeel is dat een inspecteur of bemanningslid heeft gehandeld in strijd met de wetten en voorschriften of andere voorwaarden ter zake van inspectie-activiteiten genoemd in dit Protocol, maakt zij dit bekend aan de inspecterende Partij, die, op verzoek van de geïnspecteerde Partij, die persoon onmiddellijk schrapt uit de lijst van inspecteurs en bemanningsleden. Indien die persoon zich bevindt op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie wordt uitgevoerd, trekt de inspecterende Partij die persoon onverwijld uit dat grondgebied terug.  

### 7  

De geïnspecteerde Partij is verantwoordelijk voor de veiligheid van het inspectieteam en de bemanningsleden vanaf het tijdstip waarop zij aankomen op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek tot het tijdstip waarop zij vertrekken van het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek om het grondgebied van die Partij te verlaten.  

### 8  

Het begeleidingsteam staat het inspectieteam bij in de vervulling van zijn taken. Het begeleidingsteam kan naar eigen goeddunken gebruik maken van het recht om het inspectieteam te vergezellen vanaf het tijdstip waarop dit het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd binnenkomt tot het tijdstip waarop het dat grondgebied verlaat.  

### 9  

De inspecterende Partij ziet erop toe dat het inspectieteam en de subteams over de nodige talenkennis beschikken om gemakkelijk te kunnen communiceren met het begeleidingsteam in de taal die is bekendgemaakt in overeenstemming met Titel IV, paragraaf 2, letter F, en paragraaf 3, letter E, van dit Protocol. De geïnspecteerde Partij ziet erop toe dat het begeleidingsteam over de nodige talenkennis beschikt om gemakkelijk in die taal te kunnen communiceren met het inspectieteam en elk subteam. Inspecteurs en leden van het begeleidingsteam mogen ook in andere talen met elkander communiceren.  

### 10  

Informatie die tijdens inspecties is verkregen, wordt niet openbaar gemaakt zonder de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de inspecterende Partij.  

### 11  

Gedurende hun aanwezigheid op het grondgebied van een Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd, hebben de inspecteurs het recht om zich in verbinding te stellen met de ambassade of het consulaat van de inspecterende Partij gelegen op dat grondgebied, met gebruikmaking van de door de geïnspecteerde Partij ter beschikking gestelde telecommunicatiemiddelen. De geïnspecteerde Partij stelt ook middelen voor de communicatie tussen de subteams van een inspectieteam ter beschikking.  

### 12  

De geïnspecteerde Partij vervoert het inspectieteam naar, van en tussen de inspectieplaatsen, met gebruikmaking van de door haar te kiezen vervoermiddelen en route. De inspecterende Partij kan verzoeken om een afwijking van de gekozen route. De geïnspecteerde Partij willigt dat verzoek indien mogelijk in. Wanneer zulks onderling is overeengekomen, kan de inspecterende Partij haar eigen landvoertuigen gebruiken.  

### 13  

Ingeval een noodsituatie ontstaat die de inspecteurs noopt van een inspectieplaats te reizen naar een punt van binnenkomst/vertrek of naar de ambassade of het consulaat van de inspecterende Partij op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie wordt uitgevoerd, doet het inspectieteam daarvan kennisgeving aan het begeleidingsteam, dat onverwijld voorzieningen treft voor die reis en, indien noodzakelijk, geschikte vervoermiddelen ter beschikking stelt.  

### 14  

De geïnspecteerde Partij stelt het inspectieteam op de inspectieplaats een ruimte ter beschikking voor de opslag van de uitrusting en voorraden, het schrijven van rapporten, alsmede voor rustpauzes en maaltijden.  

### 15  

Het is het inspectieteam toegestaan de voor het houden van de inspectie benodigde documenten mee te brengen, in het bijzonder zijn eigen kaarten en plattegronden. Inspecteurs mogen draagbare passieve nachtzichtapparatuur, verrekijkers, video- en fotocamera's, dicteerapparaten, meetlinten, zaklantaarns, magnetische kompassen en draagbare computers meenemen en gebruiken. De inspecteurs mogen ook andere benodigdheden gebruiken, mits de geïnspecteerde Partij daarmee instemt. Gedurende de gehele verblijfsperiode is het begeleidingsteam gerechtigd toe te zien op het gebruik van de door de inspecteurs meegebrachte benodigdheden; het begeleidingsteam mag zich echter niet bemoeien met het gebruik van de uitrusting die het heeft goedgekeurd in overeenstemming met Titel V, paragrafen 5 tot en met 7, van dit Protocol.  

### 16  

In geval van een inspectie ingevolge Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol geeft het inspectieteam telkens als het de inspectieplaats aanwijst die het zal inspecteren aan of de inspectie te voet, per terreinvoertuig, per helikoper, dan wel een combinatie hiervan, zal worden gehouden. Tenzij anderszins is overeengekomen, worden op de inspectieplaats de vereiste terreinvoertuigen ter beschikking gesteld en bestuurd door de geïnspecteerde Partij.  

### 17  

Telkens wanneer zulks mogelijk is, heeft het inspectieteam het recht, met inachtneming van de veiligheids- en vliegvoorschriften van de geïnspecteerde Partij en de bepalingen van de paragrafen 18 tot en met 21 van deze Titel, om gedurende inspecties ingevolge de Titels VII en VIII van dit Protocol per helikopter een vlucht boven de inspectieplaats te maken, met gebruikmaking van een door de geïnspecteerde Partij ter beschikking gestelde en bestuurde helikopter.  

### 18  

De geïnspecteerde Partij is niet verplicht een helikopter ter beschikking te stellen op inspectieplaatsen met een oppervlakte van minder dan 20 vierkante kilometer.  

### 19  

De geïnspecteerde Partij heeft het recht om het vliegen per helikopter boven gevoelige punten uit te stellen, te beperken of te weigeren, maar de aanwezigheid van gevoelige punten mag geen beletsel vormen voor het vliegen per helikopter over de overige delen van de inspectieplaats. Het fotograferen van of boven gevoelige punten tijdens vluchten per helikopter is slechts toegestaan indien het begeleidingsteam daarmee instemt.  

### 20  

De duur van bedoelde helikoptervluchten boven een inspectieplaats mag niet langer zijn dan in totaal één uur, tenzij anders is overeengekomen tussen het inspectieteam en het begeleidingsteam.  

### 21  

De door de geïnspecteerde Partij ter beschikking gestelde helikopters moeten groot genoeg zijn om ten minste twee leden van het inspectieteam en ten minste één lid van het begeleidingsteam te kunnen vervoeren. Tijdens het vliegen over de inspectieplaats mogen de inspecteurs de in paragraaf 15 van deze Titel bedoelde benodigdheden meenemen en gebruiken. Telkens wanneer het inspectieteam voornemens is foto's te nemen tijdens inspectievluchten deelt het dit mede aan het begeleidingsteam. Een helikopter moet de inspecteurs ononderbroken en ongehinderd uitzicht op de grond kunnen bieden.  

### 22  

Bij de vervulling van hun taken bemoeien de inspecteurs zich niet rechtstreeks met de gang van zaken op een inspectieplaats; zij mogen de verrichtingen op een inspectieplaats niet onnodig hinderen of vertragen, noch maatregelen nemen die het veilig functioneren beïnvloeden.  

### 23  

Voor zover in de paragrafen 24 tot en met 29 van deze Titel niet anders is bepaald, wordt tijdens een inspectie van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied aan inspecteurs toegang verleend en een ongehinderde inspectie toegestaan als volgt: 

A. in geval van een gespecificeerd gebied, binnen het gehele gespecificeerde gebied; en  

B. in geval van een verificatie-object, binnen het gehele grondgebied van de opgegeven inspectieplaats, met uitzondering van zones die op de plattegrond zijn gemarkeerd als zones die uitsluitend behoren tot een ander verificatie-object dat het inspectieteam niet heeft aangewezen voor inspectie.    

### 24  

Gedurende een inspectie ingevolge Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied hebben de inspecteurs het recht, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van paragraaf 25 van deze Titel, om binnen de in paragraaf 23 van deze Titel genoemde gebieden alle terreinen, opstallen of ruimten binnen opstallen te betreden waar zich permanent of veelvuldig gevechtstanks, pantsergevechtsvoertuigen, artillerie, gevechtshelikopters, gevechtsvliegtuigen, gereclassificeerde lesvliegtuigen met gevechtscapaciteit, op een gepantserd personeelsvoertuig of op een pantserinfanteriegevechtsvoertuig lijkende voertuigen of brugleggende tanks bevinden. Inspecteurs zijn niet gerechtigd andere opstallen of ruimten binnen opstallen te betreden die slechts toegankelijk zijn via deuren voor personeel, met een breedte van ten hoogste 2 meter, en waartoe de toegang is geweigerd door het begeleidingsteam.  

### 25

### 27  

De geïnspecteerde Partij heeft het recht afzonderlijke gevoelige uitrustingsstukken af te dekken.  

### 28  

Het begeleidingsteam heeft het recht de toegang te weigeren tot gevoelige punten, waarvan het aantal en de omvang zo beperkt mogelijk dient te blijven, tot afgedekte objecten en tot containers waarvan de afmetingen (breedte, hoogte, lengte of doorsnede) kleiner zijn dan twee meter. Wanneer er een gevoelig punt wordt aangewezen of er afgedekte objecten of containers aanwezig zijn, geeft het begeleidingsteam op of het gevoelige punt, het afgedekte object of de container gevechtstanks, pantsergevechtsvoertuigen, artillerie, gevechtshelikopters, gevechtsvliegtuigen, gereclassificeerde lesvliegtuigen met gevechtscapaciteit, op een gepantserd personeelsvoertuig of op een pantserinfanteriegevechtsvoertuig lijkende voertuigen of brugleggende tanks bevat, en zo ja, hun aantallen en typen, modellen of versies.  

### 29  

Indien het begeleidingsteam opgeeft dat een gevoelig punt, een afgedekt object of een container één van de in paragraaf 28 van deze Titel genoemde conventionele wapensystemen bevat, toont of noemt het begeleidingsteam die conventionele wapensystemen aan het inspectieteam en neemt het stappen om het inspectieteam ervan te overtuigen dat er niet meer conventionele wapensystemen aanwezig zijn dan het opgegeven aantal.  

### 30  

Indien gedurende een inspectie ingevolge Titel VII en VIII van dit Protocol van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied er op een inspectieplaats een helikopter aanwezig is van een type dat is of was opgenomen in de lijst van algemeen inzetbare aanvalshelikopters in het Protocol inzake bestaande typen die door het begeleidingsteam is opgegeven als gevechtsondersteunende helikopter, of indien er op een inspectieplaats een helikopter aanwezig is van het type Mi-24R of Mi-24K die door het begeleidingsteam is opgegeven als beperkt ingevolge Titel I, paragraa("3, van het Protocol inzake de recategorisering van helikopters, is die helikopter onderworpen aan inwendige inspectie in overeenstemming met Titel IX, paragrafen 4 tot en met 6, van dit Protocol.  

### 31  

Indien gedurende een inspectie ingevolge Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied er op een inspectieplaats een vliegtuig aanwezig is van bepaald model of bepaalde versie van lesvliegtuigen met gevechtscapaciteit, genoemd in Titel II van het Protocol inzake de reclassificering van vliegtuigen, dat door het begeleidingsteam is opgegeven als gecertificeerd als onbewapend in overeenstemming met het Protocol inzake de reclassificering van vliegtuigen, is dat vliegtuig onderworpen aan inwendige inspectie in overeenstemming met Titel IX, paragrafen 4 en 5, van dit Protocol.  

### 32  

Indien gedurende een inspectie van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied ingevolge Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol er op een inspectieplaats een pantservoertuig aanwezig is dat door het begeleidingsteam is opgegeven als op een gepantserd personeelsvoertuig of op een pantserinfanteriegevechtsvoertuig lijkend voertuig, heeft het inspectieteam het recht zich ervan te vergewissen dat dat voertuig geen infanteriegevechtsgroep kan vervoeren. De inspecteurs hebben het recht te verlangen dat de deuren en /of luiken van het voertuig worden geopend, zodat het inwendige van het voertuig van buiten af kan worden waargenomen. Gevoelige uitrusting in of op het voertuig mag worden afgedekt.  

### 33  

Indien gedurende een inspectie van een verificatie-object of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied ingevolge Titel VII of VIII van dit Protocol er op een inspectieplaats exemplaren aanwezig zijn die door het begeleidingsteam zijn opgegeven als verminderd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het Protocol inzake vermindering, heeft het inspectieteam het recht die exemplaren te inspecteren om zich ervan te vergewissen dat zij zijn verminderd in overeenstemming met de procedures genoemd in de Titels III tot en met XII van het Protocol inzake vermindering.  

### 34  

De inspecteurs hebben het recht foto's, waaronder video-opnamen, te maken met het doel de aanwezigheid vast te leggen van conventionele wapensystemen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is; dit geldt ook voor aangewezen permanente opslagplaatsen of andere opslagplaatsen waar zich meer dan 50 van zulke conventionele wapensystemen bevinden. Het gebruik van fotocamera's is beperkt tot 35 mm-camera's en polaroid-camera's. Het inspectieteam deelt het begeleidingsteam op voorhand mede of het voornemens is om foto's te maken. Het begeleidingsteam verleent medewerking aan het maken van foto's door het inspectieteam.

Het fotograferen van gevoelige punten is slechts toegestaan met toestemming van het begeleidingsteam.  

### 36  

Tenzij in paragraaf 38 van deze Titel anders is bepaald, is het fotograferen van het inwendige van andere opstallen dan opslagplaatsen genoemd in paragraaf 34 van deze Titel slechts toegestaan met toestemming van het begeleidingsteam.  

### 37  

De inspecteurs hebben het recht om maten te controleren ten einde onduidelijkheden op te lossen die tijdens inspecties aan het licht treden. De tijdens de inspectie vastgestelde maten worden onmiddellijk bevestigd door een lid van het inspectieteam en een lid van het begeleidingsteam. Deze bevestigde gegevens worden vermeld in het inspectierapport.  

### 38  

Telkens wanneer zulks mogelijk is, lossen de Partijen tijdens een inspectie onduidelijkheden op die zich voordoen met betrekking tot feitenmateriaal. Telkens wanneer inspecteurs het begeleidingsteam verzoeken een dergelijke onduidelijkheid op te helderen, verschaft het begeleidingsteam het inspectieteam onmiddellijk opheldering. Indien de inspecteurs besluiten een niet opgehelderde onduidelijkheid fotografisch vast te leggen, verleent het begeleidingsteam, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van paragraaf 35 van deze Titel, medewerking aan het maken van de desbetreffende foto's door het inspectieteam, zulks met gebruikmaking van een polaroid-camera. Wordt een onduidelijkheid niet tijdens de inspectie opgelost, dan worden de kwestie, de daarop betrekking hebbende toelichting en eventuele relevante foto's opgenomen in het inspectierapport in overeenstemming met Titel XII van dit Protocol.  

### 39  

Bij inspecties ingevolge de Titels VII en VIII van dit Protocol wordt de inspectie geacht te zijn voltooid wanneer het inspectierapport is ondertekend en medeondertekend.  

### 40  

Uiterlijk bij de voltooiing van een inspectie op een opgegeven inspectieplaats of binnen een gespecificeerde zone deelt het inspectieteam aan het begeleidingsteam mede of het voornemens is een volgende inspectie te houden. Indien het inspectieteam voornemens is een volgende inspectie te houden, wijst het op dat tijdstip de volgende inspectieplaats aan. In dergelijke gevallen verzekert de geïnspecteerde Partij, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van Titel VII, paragrafen 6 en 17, en Titel VIII, paragraaf 6, letter A, van dit Protocol, dat het inspectieteam zo spoedig mogelijk na voltooiing van de voorgaande inspectie op de volgende inspectieplaats aankomt.

A. op elke opgegeven inspectieplaats met hetzelfde punt van binnenkomst/vertrek als de vorige inspectieplaats of met hetzelfde punt van binnenkomst/vertrek als dat waarop het inspectieteam is aangekomen; of  

B. binnen een gespecificeerd gebied waarvoor het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek waarop het inspectieteam is aangekomen, het dichtstbij gelegen punt van binnenkomst/vertrek is, dat is bekendgemaakt ingevolge Titel V van het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling; of  

C. op elke plaats binnen 200 kilometer van de vorige inspectieplaats binnen hetzelfde militaire district; of  

D. op de plaats die volgens een mededeling van de geïnspecteerde Partij ingevolge Titel VII, paragraaf 11, letter A, de tijdelijke verblijfplaats is van de gevechtstanks, pantsergevechtsvoertuigen, artillerie, gevechtshelikopters, gevechtsvliegtuigen of brugleggende tanks die afwezig waren tijdens de inspectie van een verificatie-object op de vorige inspectieplaats, ingeval die conventionele wapensystemen meer dan 15% uitmaken van het aantal conventionele wapensystemen dat is bekendgemaakt in de laatste bekendmaking ingevolge het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling; of  

E. op een opgegeven inspectieplaats die volgens een mededeling van de geïnspecteerde Partij ingevolge Titel VII, paragraaf 11, letter B, van dit Protocol de plaats van herkomst is van de gevechtstanks, pantsergevechtsvoertuigen, artillerie, gevechtshelikopters, gevechtsvliegtuigen of brugleggende tanks op de vorige inspectieplaats waarmee het aantal op de vorige inspectieplaats aanwezige conventionele wapensystemen dat is bekendgemaakt in de laatste bekendmaking ingevolge het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling wordt overschreden, ingeval die conventionele wapensystemen het aldus bekendgemaakte aantal met meer dan 15% overschrijden.    

### 42  

Na voltooiing van een inspectie op een opgegeven inspectieplaats of binnen een gespecificeerd gebied wordt het inspectieteam, indien geen volgende inspectie is aangekondigd, zo spoedig mogelijk vervoerd naar het desbetreffende punt van binnenkomst/vertrek en verlaat het het grondgebied van de Partij waar de inspectie is uitgevoerd binnen 24 uur.  

### 43  

Het inspectieteam verlaat het grondgebied van de Partij waar het inspecties heeft gehouden via hetzelfde punt van binnenkomst/ vertrek als dat waar het is binnengekomen, tenzij anderszins is overeengekomen. Indien een inspectieteam wenst door te reizen naar een punt van binnenkomst/vertrek op het grondgebied van een andere Partij om inspecties te houden, is het daartoe gerechtigd, mits de inspecterende Partij is overgegaan tot de vereiste bekendmaking in overeenstemming met Titel IV, paragraaf 1 van dit Protocol.  

### TITEL  VII  

####INSPECTIE VAN OPGEGEVEN INSPECTIEPLAATSEN

### 1  

Inspectie ingevolge dit Protocol van een opgegeven inspectieplaats kan niet worden geweigerd. Een inspectie kan slechts worden geweigerd in geval van overmacht of op grond van de bepalingen van Titel II, paragrafen 7 en 20 tot en met 22, van dit Protocol.  

### 2  

Behoudens het in paragraaf 3 van deze Titel bepaalde komt een inspectieteam op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd aan via een punt van binnenkomst/vertrek dat ingevolge Titel V van het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling is toegewezen aan de opgegeven inspectieplaats die het beoogt aan te wijzen als eerste inspectieplaats ingevolge paragraaf 7 van deze Titel.  

### 3  

Indien een inspecterende Partij een doorlaatpost te land of een zeehaven als punt van binnenkomst/vertrek wenst te gebruiken eri de geïnspecteerde Partij nog niet een doorlaatpost te land of zeehaven als punt van binnenkomst/vertrek heeft bekendgemaakt ingevolge Titel V van het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling voor de opgegeven inspectieplaats die de inspecterende Partij wenst aan te wijzen als eerste inspectieplaats ingevolge paragraaf 7 van deze Titel, geeft de inspecterende Partij in de bekendmaking uit hoofde van Titel IV, paragraaf 2, van dit Protocol de doorlaatpost te land of zeehaven aan die zij wenst als punt van binnenkomst/vertrek. De geïnspecteerde Partij geeft in haar ontvangstbevestiging van de bekendmaking, bedoeld in Titel IV, paragraaf 4, van dit Protocol, aan of dit punt van binnenkomst/vertrek aanvaardbaar is of niet. In laatstbedoeld geval maakt de geïnspecteerde Partij aan de inspecterende Partij een ander punt van binnenkomst/vertrek bekend, dat zo dicht mogelijk is gelegen bij het gewenste punt van binnenkomst/vertrek en dat een luchthaven, bekendgemaakt ingevolge Titel V van het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling, een zeehaven of een doorlaatpost te land kan zijn, waarlangs het inspectieteam en de bemanningsleden op haar grondgebied kunnen aankomen.  

### 4  

Indien een inspecterende Partij haar wens bekendmaakt een doorlaatpost te land of een zeehaven te gebruiken als punt van binnenkomst/ vertrek ingevolge paragraaf 3 van deze Titel, moet zij voorafgaande aan die bekendmaking nagaan of er voldoende zekerheid bestaat dat haar inspectieteam de eerste opgegeven inspectieplaats waar zij een inspectie wenst uit te voeren binnen de in paragraaf 8 van deze Titel genoemde termijn kan bereiken met vervoermiddelen over land.  

### 5  

Indien een inspectieteam en bemanningsleden ingevolge paragraaf 3 van deze Titel aankomen op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie zal worden uitgevoerd via een ander punt van binnenkomst/vertrek dan het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek dat, ingevolge Titel V van het Protocol inzake informatie-uitwisseling, was bekendgemaakt in verband met de opgegeven inspectieplaats die zij als eerste inspectieplaats wenst aan te wijzen, maakt de geïnspecteerde partij zo spoedig mogelijk de toegang tot die aangewezen inspectieplaats mogelijk, waarbij zij, indien nodig, de in paragraaf 8 van deze Titel genoemde termijn mag overschrijden.  

### 6  

De geïnspecteerde Partij heeft na de aanwijzing van een opgegeven inspectieplaats ten hoogste zes uur de tijd om de aankomst van het inspectieteam op die inspectieplaats voor te bereiden.  

### 7  

Op het ingevolge Titel IV, paragraaf 2, letter E, van dit Protocol bekendgemaakte tijdstip, dat niet minder dan een uur en niet meer dan 16 uur na de aankomst op het punt van binnenkomst/vertrek mag liggen, wijst het inspectieteam de eerste inspectieplaats aan die het zal inspecteren.  

### 8  

De geïnspecteerde Partij zorgt ervoor dat het inspectieteam op de snelst mogelijke wijze naar de eerste opgegeven inspectieplaats reist en dat het zo spoedig mogelijk, doch uiterlijk negen uur na de aanwijzing van de te inspecteren inspectieplaats, aankomt, tenzij het inspectieteam en het begeleidingsteam anderszins zijn overeengekomen of tenzij de inspectieplaats is gelegen in een bergachtig of moeilijk toegankelijk gebied. In dat geval wordt het inspectieteam uiterlijk 15 uur na de aanwijzing van de inspectieplaats naar de inspectieplaats vervoerd. Indien de reistijd meer bedraagt dan negen uur, telt de extra benodigde tijd niet mee voor de verblijfsperiode van dat inspectieteam.  

### 9  

Onmiddellijk na aankomst op de opgegeven inspectieplaats wordt het inspectieteam begeleid naar een voorlichtingsruimte, waar een plattegrond van de opgegeven inspectieplaats wordt verstrekt, voor zover deze niet was verstrekt bij een eerdere uitwisseling van plattegronden.

Bovendien worden aan inspecteurs en bemanningsleden de voorrechten verleend die diplomatieke ambtenaren genieten uit hoofde van artikel 36, eerste lid, letter b, van het Verdrag van Wenen inzake diplomatiek verkeer van 18 april 1961.

De vervoermiddelen van het inspectieteam zijn onschendbaar, tenzij in het Verdrag anders is bepaald.

De inspecterende Partij kan afstand doen van de immuniteit van rechtsmacht van haar inspecteurs of bemanningsleden ingeval zij van mening is dat de immuniteit een beletsel zou vormen voor de rechtsbedeling en dat daarvan afstand kan worden gedaan zonder afbreuk te doen aan de uitvoering van de bepalingen van het Verdrag. Van de immuniteit van inspecteurs en bemanningsleden die geen onderdaan zijn van de inspecterende Partij kan slechts afstand worden gedaan door de Partijen waarvan die inspecteurs onderdaan zijn. Het doen van afstand van immuniteit dient altijd uitdrukkelijk kenbaar te worden gemaakt.  

### 5  

De voorrechten en immuniteiten waarin deze Titel voorziet, worden verleend aan inspecteurs en bemanningsleden: 

A. wanneer zij op doorreis zijn via het grondgebied van een Partij om een inspectie te houden op het grondgebied van een andere Partij;  

B. gedurende hun verblijf op het grondgebied van de Partij waar een inspectie wordt uitgevoerd; en  

C. daarna met betrekking tot eerder verrichte handelingen in de uitoefening van officiële taken als inspecteur of bemanningslid.    

### 6  

Indien de geïnspecteerde Partij van oordeel is dat een inspecteur of bemanningslid misbruik heeft gemaakt van zijn voorrechten en immuniteiten, zijn de bepalingen van Titel VI, paragraaf 6, van dit Protocol van toepassing. Op verzoek van één van de betrokken Partijen vindt onderling overleg plaats ten einde herhaling van een dergelijk misbruik te voorkomen.
