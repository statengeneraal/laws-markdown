### Artikel  III  

####Quotums

###AFDELING I

###ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

1.  Elke Staat-Partij is gerechtigd observatievluchten uit te voeren in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Elke Staat-Partij is verplicht observatievluchten te dulden boven zijn grondgebied in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
3.  Elke Staat-Partij is gerechtigd een aantal observatievluchten uit te voeren boven het grondgebied van elke andere Staat-Partij dat gelijk is aan het aantal observatievluchten dat die Staat-Partij mag uitvoeren boven het grondgebied van eerstgenoemde Staat-Partij.   
4.  Het totale aantal observatievluchten dat elke Staat-Partij boven zijn grondgebied moet dulden, vormt het totale passieve quotum van die Staat-Partij. De toekenning van het totale passieve quotum aan de Staten-Partijen is neergelegd in Afdeling I van Bijlage A bij dit Verdrag.   
5.  Het aantal observatievluchten dat een Staat-Partij elk jaar mag uitvoeren boven het grondgebied van elk van de andere Staten-Partijen, vormt het individuele actieve quotum van die Staat-Partij ten aanzien van die andere Staat-Partij. De som van de individuele actieve quotums vormt het totale actieve quotum van die Staat-Partij. Het totale actieve quotum van een Staat-Partij mag niet groter zijn dan zijn totale passieve quotum.   
6.  De eerste verdeling van de actieve quotums is neergelegd in Afdeling II van Bijlage A bij dit Verdrag.   
7.  Na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag wordt de verdeling van de actieve quotums voor het volgende kalenderjaar onderworpen aan een jaarlijkse toetsing in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie. Ingeval het tijdens die jaarlijkse toetsing onmogelijk is binnen drie weken overeenstemming te bereiken over de verdeling van de actieve quotums met betrekking tot een bepaalde Staat-Partij, blijft de verdeling van de actieve quotums van het voorgaande jaar met betrekking tot die Staat-Partij ongewijzigd gehandhaafd.   
8.  Behoudens het in artikel VIII bepaalde wordt elke door een Staat-Partij uitgevoerde observatievlucht in mindering gebracht op het individuele en het totale actieve quotum van die Staat-Partij.   
9.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het derde en het vijfde lid van deze Afdeling, kan een Staat-Partij waaraan een actief quotum is toegekend, na overeenstemming met de Staat-Partij boven het grondgebied waarvan zal worden gevlogen, zijn gehele totale actieve quotum, of een gedeelte daarvan, overdragen aan andere Staten-Partijen, waarvan hij onmiddellijk kennisgeving doet aan alle andere Staten-Partij en en aan de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie. Het tiende lid van de Afdeling is van toepassing.   
10.  Een Staat-Partij mag boven het grondgebied van een andere Staat-Partij niet meer observatievluchten uitvoeren dan 50 procent, naar boven afgerond op het eerstvolgende hele getal, van zijn eigen totale actieve quotum of van het totale passieve quotum van die andere Staat-Partij, naar gelang van welk aantal het kleinst is.   
11.  De maximale vliegafstanden van observatievluchten boven de grondgebieden van de Staten-Partij en zijn neergelegd in Afdeling III van Bijlage A bij dit Verdrag.  
###AFDELING II

###BEPALINGEN BETREFFENDE EEN GROEP STATEN-PARTIJEN

1.  

A. Onverminderd hun rechten en verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag, kunnen twee of meer Staten-Partijen die quotums bezitten, op het tijdstip van ondertekening en daarna een groep Staten-Partijen vormen. Op een groep Staten-Partijen die na de ondertekening van dit Verdrag is gevormd, zijn de bepalingen van deze Afdeling niet eerder van toepassing dan zes maanden nadat alle andere Staten-Partijen in kennis zijn gesteld, zulks met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het zesde lid van deze Afdeling.  

B. Een groep Staten-Partijen werkt met betrekking tot de actieve en passieve quotums samen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het tweede of het derde lid van deze Afdeling.     
2.  

A. De leden van een groep Staten-Partijen hebben het recht hun actieve quotums voor het lopende jaar onderling te herverdelen, met handhaving van hun individuele passieve quotum. Alle betrokken derde Staten-Partijen worden onmiddellijk van de herverdeling in kennis gesteld.  

B. Voor een observatievlucht worden evenveel observatievluchten op het individuele en het totale actieve quotum van de observerende Partij in mindering gebracht als er geobserveerde Partijen zijn behorende tot de groep boven het grondgebied waarvan wordt gevlogen. Op het totale passieve quotum van elke geobserveerde Partij wordt daarvoor één observatievlucht in mindering gebracht.  

C. Elke Staat-Partij ten aanzien waarvan één of meer leden van een groep Staten-Partijen actieve quotums hebben, heeft het recht boven het grondgebied van elk lid van de groep 50 procent meer observatievluchten, naar boven afgerond op het eerstvolgende hele getal, uit te voeren dan zijn individuele actieve quotum ten aanzien van dat lid van de groep, dan wel twee vluchten, indien hij geen actief quotum bezit ten aanzien van dat lid van de groep.  

D. Ingeval hij dit recht uitoefent, vermindert de betrokken Staat-Partij zijn actieve quotums ten aanzien van andere leden van de groep zodanig, dat de totale som van de observatievluchten die hij boven hun grondgebieden uitvoert, niet meer bedraagt dan de som van de individuele actieve quotums welke die Staat-Partij in het lopende jaar bezit ten aanzien van alle leden van de groep.  

E. De maximale vliegafstanden van observatievluchten boven het grondgebied van elk lid van de groep zijn van toepassing. Ingeval een observatievlucht wordt uitgevoerd boven verscheidene leden, worden na het afleggen van de maximale vliegafstand boven één lid alle sensoren uitgeschakeld totdat het observatievliegtuig het punt boven het grondgebied van het volgende lid van de groep Staten-Partijen bereikt waar de observatievlucht zou aanvangen. Voor zo'n volgende observatievlucht geldt de maximale vliegafstand ten opzichte van het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld dat het dichtst bij dit punt is gelegen.     
3.  

A. Een groep Staten-Partijen is gerechtigd zich, op zijn verzoek, een gezamenlijk totaal passief quotum te doen toekennen, waarna de gezamenlijke individuele en totale actieve quotums aan die groep worden toebedeeld.  

B. In dit geval is het totale passieve quotum het totale aantal observatievluchten dat de groep Staten-Partijen elk jaar moet dulden. Het totale actieve quotum is de som van het aantal observatievluchten dat de groep Staten-Partijen elk jaar mag uitvoeren. Zijn totale actieve quotum mag niet groter zijn dan zijn totale passieve quotum.  

C. Een observatievlucht uit hoofde van het totale actieve quotum van de groep Staten-Partijen wordt uitgevoerd namens de groep.  

D. Observatievluchten die een groep Staten-Partijen moet dulden, kunnen worden uitgevoerd boven het grondgebied van één of meer van zijn leden.  

E. De maximale vliegafstanden van elke groep Staten-Partijen worden aangegeven overeenkomstig Afdeling III van Bijlage A en „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden worden aangewezen overeenkomstig Bijlage E bij dit Verdrag.     
4.  In overeenstemming met de algemene beginselen vervat in artikel X, derde lid, kan elke derde Staat-Partij die van oordeel is dat zijn rechten krachtens de bepalingen van Afdeling I, derde lid, van dit artikel op onbehoorlijke wijze zijn beperkt door het optreden van een groep Staten-Partijen, dit probleem voorleggen aan de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie.   
5.  De groep Staten-Partijen ziet erop toe dat er procedures worden ingesteld die het uitvoeren van observatievluchten boven de grondgebieden van zijn leden mogelijk maken tijdens één missie, indien nodig met inbegrip van bijtanken. In het geval van een groep Staten-Partijen die is gevormd overeenkomstig het derde lid van deze Afdeling, mogen die observatievluchten de maximale vliegafstand die geldt voor de „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden waar de observatievluchten aanvangen, niet overschrijden.   
6.  Ten vroegste zes maanden nadat kennisgeving van de beslissing is gedaan aan alle andere Staten-Partijen: 

A. kan een groep Staten-Partijen die is gevormd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van deze Afdeling worden omgevormd in een groep Staten-Partijen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het derde lid van deze Afdeling;  

B. kan een groep Staten-Partijen die is gevormd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het derde lid van deze Afdeling worden omgevormd in een groep Staten-Partijen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid van deze Afdeling;  

C. kan een Staat-Partij zich terugtrekken uit een groep Staten-Partijen; of  

D. kan een groep Staten-Partijen andere Staten-Partijen toelaten die een quotum bezitten.     
7.  Na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag worden wijzigingen in de toekenning of verdeling van quotums ten gevolge van de vorming van, dan wel toelating tot of terugtrekking uit, een groep Staten-Partijen overeenkomstig het derde lid van deze Afdeling, van kracht op 1 januari na de eerstvolgende jaarlijkse toetsing in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie die plaatsvindt na de kennisgevingstermijn van zes maanden. Wanneer nodig worden nieuwe „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden aangewezen en worden dienovereenkomstig maximale vliegafstanden vastgesteld.   

### Artikel  IV  

####Sensoren

1.  Tenzij anders is bepaald in het derde lid van dit artikel, is een observatievliegtuig slechts uitgerust met sensoren van de volgende categorieën: 

A. optische panorama- en fotocamera's;  

B. videocamera's met directe weergave;  

C. infrarood-lijnaftasttoestellen, en  

D. zijwaarts gerichte radars met synthetische apertuur.     
2.  Een Staat-Partij kan ten behoeve van het uitvoeren van observatievluchten elk van de in het eerste lid genoemde sensoren gebruiken, mits die sensoren voor alle Staten-Partijen in de handel verkrijgbaar zijn en de volgende prestatielimieten in acht worden genomen: 

A. bij optische panorama- en fotocamera's, een grondresolutie van niet beter dan 30 centimeter op de in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage D, Aanhangsel 1, vastgestelde minimumhoogte boven de grond, verkregen met ten hoogste één panorama- camera, één verticaal geïnstalleerde fotocamera en twee schuin geïnstalleerde fotocamera's, één aan weerszijden van het vliegtuig, die aan weerszijden van de vliegbaan van het vliegtuig een gronddekking tot 50 kilometer mogelijk maken, die niet continu behoeft te zijn;  

B. bij videocamera's, een grondresolutie van niet beter dan 30 centimeter, verkregen op de laagste minimumhoogte boven de grond bij één van de in letter A van dit lid genoemde optische camera's;  

C. bij infrarood-lijnaftasttoestellen, een grondresolutie van niet beter dan 50 centimeter op de in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage D, Aanhangsel 1, vastgestelde minimumhoogte boven de grond, verkregen met één toestel; en  

D. bij zijwaarts gerichte radars met synthetische apertuur, een grondresolutie van niet beter dan drie meter, berekend door middel van de impulsresponsmethode, die, met toepassing van de objectscheidingsmethode, overeenkomt met het vermogen om op een radarbeeld twee hoekreflectoren te onderscheiden, waarvan de middelpunten ten minste vijf meter uit elkaar liggen, zulks over een strookbreedte van ten hoogste 25 kilometer, verkregen met één radareenheid die aan weerszijden van het vliegtuig kan worden ingesteld, doch niet aan beide zijden tegelijk.     
3.  De invoering van extra categorieën sensoren en verbeteringen van het vermogen van de bestaande categorieën sensoren als genoemd in dit artikel zal worden besproken door de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie in overeenstemming met artikel X van dit Verdrag.   
4.  Alle sensoren dienen te zijn voorzien van apertuurkappen of andere inrichtingen die het gebruik van de sensoren verhinderen, teneinde te voorkomen dat gegevens worden verzameld gedurende de transitvluchten of de vluchten naar de punten van binnenkomst of vanaf de punten van vertrek boven het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij. Deze kappen of andere richtingen dienen slechts van buiten het observatievliegtuig te kunnen worden verwijderd of bediend.   
5.  Apparatuur die de door de sensoren verzamelde gegevens van verklarende aantekeningen kan voorzien in overeenstemming met Bijlage B, Afdeling II, is toegestaan aan boord van het observatievliegtuig. De Staat-Partij die het observatievliegtuig voor een observatievlucht ter beschikking stelt, voorziet de door de sensoren verzamelde gegevens van de verklarende aantekeningen als bedoeld in Afdeling II van Bijlage B bij dit Verdrag.   
6.  Apparatuur die de door de sensoren verzamelde gegevens direct kan weergeven, is toegestaan aan boord van het observatievliegtuig om de werking en de bediening van de sensoren tijdens het uitvoeren van een observatievlucht te kunnen controleren.   
7.  Behalve indien het bedienen van toegelaten sensoren of het vliegen met het observatievliegtuig zulks vereist of indien zulks is bepaald in het vijfde en zesde lid van dit artikel, is het verzamelen, verwerken, doorgeven of registreren van elektronische signalen van elektromagnetische golven aan boord van het observatievliegtuig verboden en is het niet toegestaan apparatuur hiervoor aan boord van het observatievliegtuig te hebben.   
8.  Ingeval het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, heeft de observerende Partij het recht een observatievliegtuig te gebruiken dat is uitgerust met sensoren van elke categorie sensoren die het in het tweede lid van dit artikel omschreven prestatievermogen niet te boven gaan.   
9.  Ingeval het voor een observatievlucht gebruikte observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, is de geobserveerde Partij verplicht een observatievliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen dat is uitgerust met sensoren van elke in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde categorie sensoren, met het grootste vermogen en in de aantallen als genoemd in het tweede lid van dit artikel, met inachtneming van de bepalingen van artikel XVIII, Afdeling II, tenzij de observerende en geobserveerde Partij anders zijn overeengekomen. De behuizing en opstelling van die sensoren dienen zodanig te zijn, dat de in het tweede lid van dit artikel voorgeschreven gronddekking kan worden bereikt. Ingeval het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, stelt laatstgenoemde Partij een zijwaarts gerichte radar met synthetische apertuur ter beschikking met een grondresolutie van niet slechter dan zes meter, bepaald aan de hand van de objectscheidingsmethode.   
10.  Elke Staat-Partij stelt, wanneer een vliegtuig overeenkomstig artikel V van dit Verdrag als observatievliegtuig wordt aangewezen, alle andere Staten-Partijen in kennis van de in Bijlage B bij dit Verdrag bedoelde technische gegevens betreffende elke sensor die aan boord van dat vliegtuig is aangebracht.   
11.  Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht deel te nemen aan de certificering van aan boord van een observatievliegtuig aangebrachte sensoren in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage D. Een observatievliegtuig van een bepaald type mag niet voor observatievluchten worden gebruikt voordat dit type observatievliegtuig en de sensoren daarvan zijn gecertificeerd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage D bij dit Verdrag.   
12.  Een Staat-Partij die een vliegtuig als observatievliegtuig aanwijst, heeft, mits hij 90 dagen van tevoren alle andere Staten-Partijen daarvan in kennis stelt en met inachtneming van de bepalingen van Bijlage D bij dit Verdrag, het recht hetzij sensoren te verwijderen, te vervangen of toe te voegen, hetzij de in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van het tiende lid van dit artikel en Bijlage B bij dit Verdrag verstrekte technische gegevens te wijzigen. Vervangende of toegevoegde sensoren dienen te worden gecertificeerd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage D bij dit Verdrag alvorens tijdens een observatievlucht te worden gebruikt.   
13.  Ingeval een Staat-Partij of groep Staten-Partij en op grond van zijn ervaring met het gebruik van een bepaald type observatievliegtuig, van oordeel is dat een aan boord van een vliegtuig aangebrachte sensor of de bijbehorende apparatuur niet overeenstemt met de overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage D gecertificeerde exemplaren, stellen de betrokken Staten-Partijen alle andere Staten-Partijen in kennis van hun bedenkingen. De Staat-Partij die het vliegtuig heeft aangewezen: 

A. onderneemt de nodige stappen om te verzekeren dat de aan boord van een observatievliegtuig aangebrachte sensor en de bijbehorende apparatuur overeenstemmen met de overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage D gecertificeerde exemplaren, onder andere door, indien nodig, de bepaalde sensor of de bijbehorende apparatuur te repareren, bij te stellen of te vervangen; en  

B. toont op verzoek van een belanghebbende Staat-Partij aan, door middel van een demonstratievlucht, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage F, te houden bij de volgende gelegenheid dat bedoeld observatievliegtuig wordt gebruikt, dat de aan boord van het observatievliegtuig aangebrachte sensor en de bijbehorende apparatuur overeenstemmen met de overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage D gecertificeerde exemplaren. Andere Staten-Partijen die bedenkingen uiten met betrekking tot een aan boord van een observatievliegtuig aangebrachte sensor en de bijbehorende apparatuur, zijn gerechtigd personeel te zenden om aan een zodanige demonstratievlucht deel te nemen.     
14.  Ingeval, nadat de in het dertiende lid van dit artikel bedoelde stappen zijn ondernomen, de Staten-Partijen blijven betwijfelen of de aan boord van een observatievliegtuig aangebrachte sensor of de bijbehorende apparatuur overeenstemt met de overeenkomstig de bepaling van Bijlage D gecertificeerde exemplaren, kan de kwestie worden voorgelegd aan de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie.   

### Artikel  V  

####Aanwijzing van vliegtuigen

1.  Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht één of meer typen of modellen vliegtuigen die bij de desbetreffende autoriteiten van een Staat-Partij zijn ingeschreven, als observatievliegtuigen aan te wijzen.   
2.  Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht typen of modellen vliegtuigen als observatievliegtuigen aan te wijzen, dan wel nieuwe typen of modellen toe te voegen aan de eerder door hem aangewezen typen of modellen vliegtuigen, mits hij 30 dagen van tevoren alle andere Staten-Partijen daarvan in kennis stelt. De kennisgeving van de aanwijzing van vliegtuigen van een bepaald type of model dient de in Bijlage C bij dit Verdrag genoemde gegevens te bevatten.   
3.  Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht eerder door hem aangewezen typen of modellen vliegtuigen te schrappen, mits hij 90 dagen van tevoren alle andere Staten-Partijen daarvan in kennis stelt.   
4.  Er behoeft slechts één exemplaar van een bepaald type of model vliegtuig met een identiek stel bijbehorende sensoren te worden aangeboden ter certificering overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage D bij dit Verdrag.   
5.  Elk observatievliegtuig moet de bemanning en het personeel als genoemd in Artikel VI, Afdeling III, kunnen vervoeren.

Tenzij de geobserveerde Partij gebruik maakt van haar recht een door haarzelf aangewezen observatievliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen, heeft de observerende Partij het recht het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen. Ingeval de observerende Partij het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking stelt, heeft deze het recht een door haarzelf aangewezen vliegtuig of een door een andere Staat-Partij aangewezen vliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen. Ingeval de geobserveerde Partij het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking stelt, heeft de observerende Partij het recht te beschikken over een vliegtuig dat in staat is met volle tanks, met inbegrip van de nodige brandstofreserves, zonder bijtanken een minimumafstand af te leggen die gelijk is aan de helft van de maximale vliegafstand die voor de geobserveerde Partij geldt, waarvan kennisgeving is gedaan overeenkomstig het vijfde lid, letter G, van deze Afdeling.   
2.  Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht, overeenkomstig het eerste lid van deze Afdeling, een observatievliegtuig te gebruiken dat door een andere Staat-Partij voor observatievluchten is aangewezen. Door de betrokken Staten-Partijen worden regelingen inzake het gebruik van bedoelde vliegtuigen opgesteld, teneinde actieve deelneming aan het „open luchtruim"-regime mogelijk te maken.   
3.  Staten-Partijen die het recht hebben observatievluchten uit te voeren, kunnen hun plannen voor het uitvoeren van observatievluchten coördineren in overeenstemming met Bijlage H bij dit Verdrag. Een Staat-Partij is niet verplicht meer dan één observatievlucht te dulden op enig tijdstip gedurende het in het negende lid van deze Afdeling genoemde tijdvak van 96 uur, tenzij die Staat-Partij heeft verzocht om een demonstratievlucht overeenkomstig Bijlage F bij dit Verdrag. In dat geval is de geobserveerde Partij verplicht een overlapping van de observatievluchten tot ten hoogste 24 uur te aanvaarden. Na in kennis te zijn gesteld van de resultaten van de coördinatie van de plannen tot het uitvoeren van observatievluchten, stelt elke Staat-Partij over het grondgebied waarvan observatievluchten zullen worden uitgevoerd andere Staten-Partijen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Bijlage H ervan in kennis of hij met betrekking tot een bepaalde observatievlucht al dan niet gebruik maakt van zijn recht zijn eigen observatievliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen.   
4.  Uiterlijk 90 dagen na ondertekening van dit Verdrag stelt elke Staat-Partij alle andere Staten-Partijen in kennis van: 

A. het nummer van de permanente diplomatieke toestemming voor „open luchtruim"-observatievluchten, vluchten van transportvliegtuigen en transitvluchten;  

B. welke taal of talen van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie als genoemd in Afdeling I, paragraaf 7, van Bijlage L, bij dit Verdrag door het personeel zal worden gebruikt voor alle werkzaamheden in verband met het uitvoeren van observatievluchten boven zijn grondgebied en voor het opstellen van het missieplan en het missierapport, tenzij de te gebruiken taal de taal is die wordt aanbevolen in Bijlage 10 bij het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerlijke luchtvaart, band II, paragraaf 5.2.1.1.2.     
5.  De observerende Partij stelt de geobserveerde Partij in kennis van haar voornemen een observatievlucht uit te voeren, zulks ten minste 72 uur vóór het verwachte tijdstip van aankomst van de observerende Partij op het punt van binnenkomst van de geobserveerde Partij. Staten-Partijen die bedoelde kennisgevingen doen, stellen alles in het werk om te vermijden dat de voor de kennisgeving in acht te nemen minimumtermijn in een weekeinde valt. Bedoelde kennisgeving dient te omvatten: 

A. het gewenste punt van binnenkomst en, indien van toepassing, het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld waar de observatievlucht aanvangt;  

B. de datum en het verwachte tijdstip van aankomst van de observerende Partij op het punt van binnenkomst en de datum en het verwachte tijdstip van vertrek van de vlucht vanaf het punt van binnenkomst naar het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld, indien van toepassing onder vermelding van specifieke accommodatiebehoeften;  

C. de plaats, genoemd in Bijlage E, Aanhangsel 1, waar de uitvoering van de aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie wordt verlangd en de datum en het tijdstip van aanvang van bedoelde aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Bijlage F;  

D. het vervoermiddel en, indien van toepassing, het type en model transportvliegtuig waarmee naar het punt van binnenkomst zal worden gereisd ingeval het observatievliegtuig dat voor de observatievlucht wordt gebruikt, door de geobserveerde Partij ter beschikking wordt gesteld;  

E. het nummer van de diplomatieke toestemming voor de observatievlucht of voor de vlucht van het transportvliegtuig dat wordt gebruikt om personeel te vervoeren van en naar het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij ter uitvoering van een observatievlucht;  

F. de kenmerken van het observatievliegtuig, als omschreven in Bijlage C;  

G. de afstand van de observatievlucht, bij benadering; en  

H. de namen van de leden van het personeel, hun geslacht, geboortedatum en -plaats, paspoortnummer en de Staat-Partij die het paspoort heeft afgegeven, alsmede hun functie.     
6.  De geobserveerde Partij die in overeenstemming met het vijfde lid van deze Afdeling in kennis wordt gesteld, bevestigt de ontvangst van de kennisgeving binnen 24 uur. Ingeval de geobserveerde Partij gebruik maakt van haar recht het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking te stellen, omvat de ontvangstbevestiging de in het vijfde lid, letter F, van deze Afdeling bedoelde gegevens over het observatievliegtuig. Het is de observerende Partij toegestaan op het punt van binnenkomst aan te komen op het verwachte tijdstip van aankomst als bekendgemaakt in overeenstemming met het vijfde lid van deze Afdeling. Het verwachte tijdstip van vertrek van de vlucht vanaf het punt van binnenkomst naar het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld waar de observatievlucht zal aanvangen, alsmede de plaats, de datum en het tijdstip van aanvang van de aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie dienen te worden bevestigd door de geobserveerde Partij.   
7.  Het personeel van de observerende Partij mag overeenkomstig artikel XIII door andere Staten-Partijen aangewezen personeel omvatten.   
8.  De observerende Partij stelt wanneer zij, in overeenstemming met het vijfde lid van de Afdeling, kennisgeving doet aan de geobserveerde Partij tegelijkertijd alle andere Staten-Partijen in kennis van haar voornemen de observatievlucht uit te voeren.   
9.  Het tijdvak tussen het verwachte tijdstip van aankomst op het punt van binnenkomst en de voltooiing van de observatievlucht mag niet langer zijn dan 96 uur, tenzij anders is overeengekomen. Ingeval de geobserveerde Partij om een demonstratievlucht verzoekt overeenkomstig Bijlage F bij het Verdrag, dient zij het tijdvak van 96 uur te verlengen overeenkomstig Bijlage F, Afdeling III, paragraaf 4, indien de extra tijd door de observerende Partij wordt verlangd voor de onbelemmerde uitvoering van het missieplan.   
10.  Na aankomst van het observatievliegtuig op het punt van binnenkomst inspecteert de geobserveerde Partij de kappen van de sensoraperturen of andere inrichtingen die het gebruik van de sensoren verhinderen, teneinde zich ervan te vergewissen dat deze op de juiste wijze zijn aangebracht overeenkomstig Bijlage E, tenzij door alle betrokken Staten-Partijen anders is overeengekomen.   
11.  Ingeval het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, heeft de geobserveerde Partij, na aankomst van het observatievliegtuig op het punt van binnenkomst of op het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld waar de observatievlucht aanvangt, het recht de aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie uit te voeren overeenkomstig Bijlage F, Afdeling I. Ingeval in overeenstemming met het eerste lid van deze Afdeling een observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, heeft de observerende Partij het recht de aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie van de sensoren uit te voeren overeenkomstig Bijlage F, Afdeling II. Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, eindigen bedoelde inspecties ten minste vier uur vóór de geplande aanvang van de observatievlucht als genoemd in het vliegplan.   
12.  De observerende Partij ziet erop toe dat haar bemanning ten minste één persoon omvat die over de nodige talenkennis beschikt om gemakkelijk te kunnen communiceren met het personeel van de geobserveerde Partij en met de autoriteiten die zijn belast met de luchtverkeersleiding in de taal of talen waarvan door de geobserveerde Partij kennisgeving is gedaan in overeenstemming met het vierde lid van deze Afdeling.   
13.  De geobserveerde Partij verstrekt de bemanning na aankomst op het punt van binnenkomst of op het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld waar de observatievlucht aanvangt, de meest recente informatie over de weersverwachting en de luchtnavigatie, alsmede informatie betreffende de vliegveiligheid, met inbegrip van Berichten aan Luchtvarenden (NOTAM's). Deze informatie wordt op verzoek bijgewerkt. Vlieginstructies en informatie over uitwijkvliegvelden langs de vliegroute worden verstrekt na goedkeuring van het missieplan in overeenstemming met de vereisten van Afdeling II van dit artikel.   
14.  Tijdens de uitvoering van observatievluchten ingevolge dit Verdrag, worden alle observatievliegtuigen gebruikt in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en in overeenstemming met het goedgekeurde vliegplan. Onverminderd de bepalingen van Afdeling II, tweede lid, van dit artikel worden de observatievluchten tevens uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met: 

A. bekendgemaakte normen en aanbevelingen van de ICAO; en  

B. bekendgemaakte nationale regels inzake de luchtverkeersleiding, voorschriften en richtlijnen inzake de vliegveiligheid van de Staat-Partij boven het grondgebied waarvan wordt gevlogen.     
15.  Observatievluchten hebben voorrang boven het gewone luchtverkeer. De geobserveerde Partij ziet erop toe dat haar met de luchtverkeersleiding belaste autoriteiten de uitvoering van observatievluchten in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag vergemakkelijken.   
16.  Aan boord van het vliegtuig is de gezagvoerder de enige die is bekleed met het gezag ter zake van de veilige uitvoering van de vlucht en verantwoordelijk is voor de uitvoering van het vliegplan.   
17.  De geobserveerde Partij stelt ter beschikking: 

A. een ijkdoel dat geschikt is om het vermogen van de sensoren te bevestigen in overeenstemming met de in Afdeling III van Bijlage D bij dit Verdrag uiteengezette procedures, waarboven op verzoek van één van beide Partijen dient te worden gevlogen tijdens de demonstratievlucht of de observatievlucht, zulks voor iedere sensor die tijdens de observatievlucht wordt gebruikt. Het ijkdoel dient te zijn gelegen in de nabijheid van het vliegveld waar de aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie wordt uitgevoerd overeenkomstig Bijlage F bij dit Verdrag;  

B. de gebruikelijke aan commerciële vliegtuigen ter beschikking gestelde brandstoffen en onderhoudsdiensten voor het observatievliegtuig of transportvliegtuig op het punt van binnenkomst, op het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld, op een bijtankvliegveld en het punt van vertrek als vermeld in het vliegplan, overeenkomstig de gegevens die over het aangewezen vliegveld zijn bekendgemaakt;

Ingeval zich een noodsituatie voordoet, neemt de gezagvoerder de „Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services, ICAO-document nr. 4444-RAC/501/12, zoals herzien of gewijzigd, de nationale vliegvoorschriften van de geobserveerde Partij en de vlieghandleiding van het observatievliegtuig in acht.   
2.  De geobserveerde Partij stelt een observatievliegtuig dat een noodsituatie meldt alle hulpverlenings- en navigatievoorzieningen ter beschikking teneinde zorg te dragen voor de snelst mogelijke landing van het vliegtuig op het dichtstbijzijnde daarvoor in aanmerking komende vliegveld.   
3.  Ingeval het observatievliegtuig op het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij betrokken raakt bij een vliegtuigongeval, voert de geobserveerde Partij zoekacties en reddingsoperaties uit in overeenstemming met haar eigen voorschriften en procedures ter zake.   
4.  Het onderzoek betreffende een ongeval of voorval waarbij een observatievliegtuig betrokken is, wordt door de geobserveerde Partij, met medewerking van de observerende Partij, verricht in overeenstemming met de aanbevelingen van de ICAO als uiteengezet in Bijlage 13 bij het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerlijke luchtvaart („Investigation of Aviation Accidents"), zoals herzien of gewijzigd, en in overeenstemming met de nationale voorschriften van de geobserveerde Partij.   
5.  Ingeval een observatievliegtuig niet bij de geobserveerde Partij is ingeschreven, worden na afronding van het onderzoek alle wrakken en wrakstukken van het observatievliegtuig en de sensoren, indien gevonden en geborgen, teruggegeven aan de observerende Partij of aan de Partij waaraan het vliegtuig toebehoort, indien daarom wordt verzocht.   

### Artikel  IX  

####Tijdens observatievluchten door sensoren verzamelde gegevens

###AFDELING I

###ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

1.  Voor het registreren van de tijdens observatievluchten door sensoren verzamelde gegevens worden de volgende gegevensdragers gebruikt: 

A. bij optische panorama- en fotocamera's: zwart/wit-fotofilm;  

B. bij videocamera's: magneetband;  

C. bij infrarood-lijnaftasttoestellen: zwart/wit-fotofilm of magneetband; en  

D. bij zijwaarts gerichte radars met synthetische apertuur: magneetband.   Het overeengekomen formaat waarin deze gegevens worden geregistreerd en uitgewisseld op andere gegevensdragers wordt vastgesteld binnen de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Tijdens observatievluchten door sensoren verzamelde gegevens blijven aan boord van het observatievliegtuig totdat de observatievlucht is voltooid. De doorgifte van door sensoren verzamelde gegevens vanuit het observatievliegtuig is tijdens de observatievlucht verboden.   
3.  Elke filmrol en elke cassette of spoel met magneetband die is gebruikt voor het verzamelen van gegevens door een sensor tijdens een observatievlucht wordt zo spoedig mogelijk na verwijdering ervan uit de sensor in aanwezigheid van de Staten-Partijen in een houder geplaatst en verzegeld.   
4.  Tijdens observatievluchten door sensoren verzamelde gegevens worden aan Staten-Partijen ter beschikking gesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel en worden uitsluitend gebruikt ter verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen van dit Verdrag.   
5.  Ingeval op grond van ingevolge Afdeling I van Bijlage B bij dit Verdrag verstrekte gegevens een door een Staat-Partij tijdens een observatievlucht te gebruiken gegevensdrager incompatibel blijkt te zijn met de apparatuur van een andere Staat-Partij voor de gebruikmaking van die gegevensdrager, stellen de betrokken Staten-Partijen procedures vast om te verzekeren dat alle tijdens observatievluchten verzamelde gegevens door hen kunnen worden verwerkt, verveelvoudigd en opgeslagen.  
###AFDELING II

###GEGEVENS VERZAMELD DOOR SENSOREN DIE WERKEN MET FOTOFILMS

1.  Ingeval de gegevens die zijn verzameld door twee tegelijk werkende optische camera's dienen te worden uitgewisseld, moeten de camera's, de films en de ontwikkelingswijze van de films van een identiek type zijn.   
2.  Ervan uitgaande dat de door één optische camera verzamelde gegevens moeten kunnen worden uitgewisseld, buigen de Staten-Partijen zich gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing van dit Verdrag in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie over de vraag of de verantwoordelijkheid voor het ontwikkelen van het oorspronkelijke negatief berust bij de observerende Partij dan wel bij de Staat-Partij die het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking stelt. De Staat-Partij die het oorspronkelijke negatief ontwikkelt, is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit met betrekking tot het ontwikkelen van het oorspronkelijke negatief en het vervaardigen van duplicaatpositieven of -negatieven. Ingeval de Staten-Partijen overeenkomen dat de film die is gebruikt tijdens een observatievlucht die is uitgevoerd met een observatievliegtuig dat ter beschikking is gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, zal worden ontwikkeld door de observerende Partij, draagt de geobserveerde Partij geen verantwoordelijkheid voor de kwaliteit met betrekking tot het ontwikkelen van het oorspronkelijke negatief.   
3.  Alle tijdens de observatievlucht gebruikte films dienen te worden ontwikkeld: 

A. ingeval het oorspronkelijke negatief wordt ontwikkeld in een door de geobserveerde Partij ter beschikking gestelde ontwikkelinrichting, uiterlijk drie dagen na de aankomst van het observatievliegtuig op het punt van vertrek, tenzij anders is overeengekomen; of  

B. ingeval het oorspronkelijke negatief wordt ontwikkeld in een door de observerende Partij ter beschikking gestelde ontwikkelinrichting, uiterlijk tien dagen na het vertrek van het observatievliegtuig van het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij.     
4.  De Staat-Partij die het oorspronkelijke negatief ontwikkelt, is verplicht ten hoogste twee functionarissen van de andere Staat-Partij toe te laten tot de ontwikkelinrichting, teneinde het openen van de filmcassette of houder en elke etappe van de opslag, ontwikkeling, verveelvoudiging of gebruikmaking van het oorspronkelijke negatief te controleren in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Afdeling II van Bijlage K bij dit Verdrag. De Staat-Partij die het ontwikkelen en verveelvoudigen van de film controleert, heeft het recht deze functionarissen aan te wijzen te midden van haar onderdanen die zich bevinden op het grondgebied waarop de door de andere Staat-Partij ter beschikking gestelde ontwikkelinrichting is gelegen, mits deze personen zijn vermeld op de lijst van aangewezen personeel in overeenstemming met artikel XIII, Afdeling I, van dit Verdrag. De Staat-Partij die de film ontwikkelt, assisteert de functionarissen van de andere Staat-Partij in de grootst mogelijke mate bij de verrichting van de in dit lid bedoelde taken.   
5.  Na afloop van een observatievlucht wordt door de Staat-Partij die het oorspronkelijke negatief zal ontwikkelen op de aan- of uitloopstrook van elke rol van het oorspronkelijke negatief dat tijdens de observatievlucht is gebruikt hetzij een sensitometrische proefstrook van 21 trappen - van hetzelfde filmtype als dat wat tijdens de observatievlucht is gebruikt - bevestigd, hetzij een 21-trappenwig belicht. Nadat het oorspronkelijke negatief is ontwikkeld en duplicaatnegatieven of-positieven zijn vervaardigd, beoordelen de Staten-Partijen de beeldkwaliteit van de sensitometrische proefstroken van 21 trappen of de beelden van de 21-trappenwig aan de hand van de overeenkomstig Afdeling I van Bijlage K bij dit Verdrag verstrekte sensitometrische eigenschappen van dat type oorspronkelijke negatief, dan wel duplicaatnegatief of -positief.   
6.  Ingeval slechts één oorspronkelijk negatief wordt ontwikkeld: 

A. heeft de observerende Partij het recht het oorspronkelijke negatief te behouden of te ontvangen; en  

B. heeft de geobserveerde Partij het recht een volledig duplicaat van de eerste generatie, of een gedeelte daarvan, positief dan wel negatief, van het oorspronkelijke negatief uit te kiezen en te ontvangen. Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, dient dit duplicaat: 

1. hetzelfde formaat en dezelfde afmetingen te hebben als het oorspronkelijke negatief;  

2. onmiddellijk na het ontwikkelen van het oorspronkelijke negatief te zijn vervaardigd; en  

3. onmiddellijk na de vervaardiging van het duplicaat aan de functionarissen van de geobserveerde Partij te worden overhandigd.       
7.  Ingeval twee oorspronkelijke negatieven worden ontwikkeld: 

A. heeft de geobserveerde Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, het recht, na afloop van de observatievlucht, één van de twee oorspronkelijke negatieven uit te kiezen, waarna de observerende Partij het niet gekozen oorspronkelijke negatief behoudt; of  

B. heeft de observerende Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, het recht één van de twee oorspronkelijke negatieven uit te kiezen, waarna de geobserveerde Partij het niet gekozen oorspronkelijke negatief behoudt.    
###AFDELING III

###GEGEVENS VERZAMELD DOOR SENSOREN DIE WERKEN MET ANDERE GEGEVENSDRAGERS

1.  De Staat-Partij die het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking stelt, registreert ten minste één oorspronkelijke versie van de gegevens die worden verzameld door sensoren die werken met andere gegevensdragers.   
2.  Ingeval slechts één oorspronkelijke versie wordt vervaardigd: 

A. heeft de observerende Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, het recht de oorspronkelijke versie te behouden, terwijl de geobserveerde Partij het recht heeft een duplicaat van de eerste generatie te ontvangen; of  

B. heeft de observerende Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, het recht de oorspronkelijke versie te ontvangen, terwijl de geobserveerde Partij het recht heeft een duplicaat van de eerste generatie te ontvangen.     
3.  Ingeval twee oorspronkelijke versies worden vervaardigd: 

A. heeft de geobserveerde Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, het recht, na afloop van de observatievlucht, één van de twee gegevensdragers uit te kiezen, waarna de observerende Partij de andere behoudt; of  

B. heeft de observerende Partij, indien het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, het recht één van de twee gegevensdragers uit te kiezen, waarna de geobserveerde Partij de andere behoudt.     
4.  Ingeval het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de observerende Partij, heeft de geobserveerde Partij het recht de door een zijwaarts gerichte radar met synthetisch apertuur verzamelde gegevens te ontvangen in de vorm van hetzij onverwerkte gegevens, hetzij een radarbeeld, naar keuze.   
5.  Ingeval het observatievliegtuig ter beschikking wordt gesteld door de geobserveerde Partij, heeft de observerende Partij het recht de door een zijwaarts gerichte radar met synthetische apertuur verzamelde gegevens te ontvangen in de vorm van hetzij onverwerkte gegevens, hetzij een radarbeeld, naar keuze.  
###AFDELING IV

###TOEGANG TOT DOOR SENSOREN VERZAMELDE GEGEVENS

Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht de observerende Partij te verzoeken om kopieën van de tijdens een observatievlucht door sensoren verzamelde gegevens, en deze te ontvangen. Deze kopieën dienen duplicaten van de eerste generatie te zijn die zijn vervaardigd van de oorspronkelijke gegevens die tijdens een observatievlucht door sensoren zijn verzameld. De Staat-Partij die om kopieën verzoekt, stelt de geobserveerde Partij daarvan in kennis. Een verzoek om duplicaten dient de volgende informatie te bevatten: 

A. de observerende Partij;  

B. de geobserveerde Partij;  

C. de datum van de observatievlucht;  

D. de sensor waardoor de gegevens werden verzameld;  

E. het gedeelte of de gedeelten van de observatieperiode in de loop waarvan de gegevens werden verzameld; en  

F. het type en het formaat van de duplicaat-gegevensdrager, hetzij een negatieve of een positieve film, hetzij een magneetband.

Deze ijkdoelen worden gebruikt ter vaststelling van de grondresolutie van sensoren; elke categorie sensoren heeft zijn eigen type ijkdoel, ontworpen in overeenstemming met de hieronder aangegeven kenmerken.  

### 2  

IJkdoelen voor het vaststellen van de grondresolutie van optische camera's bestaan uit een reeks groepen van elkaar afwisselende zwarte en witte strepen. Elke groep strepen bestaat uit ten minste twee zwarte strepen, gescheiden door een witte streep. De breedte van de zwarte en de witte strepen binnen een groep blijft constant. De breedte van de strepen van tot een ijkdoel behorende groepen strepen verandert geleidelijk, zulks in een mate die toereikend is om een accurate meting van de grondresolutie mogelijk te maken. De lengte van de strepen blijft binnen elke groep constant. De contrastverhouding van de zwarte ten opzichte van de witte strepen blijft over het gehele ijkdoel gelijk en bedraagt ten minste 5 : 1 (overeenkomend met een modulatie van 0,66).  

### 3  

IJkdoelen voor het vaststellen van de grondresolutie van infraroodlijnaftasttoestellen worden in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie bepaald gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing.  

### 4  

IJkdoelen voor het vaststellen van de grondresolutie van zijwaarts gerichte radars met synthetische apertuur bestaan uit groepen drievlakkige hoekreflectoren, waarvan de opstelling in overeenstemming dient te zijn met de in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing bepaalde methoden.  

### 5  

Elke Staat-Partij verstrekt alle andere Staten-Partijen een schema van de ijkdoelen die hij beoogt te gebruiken ten behoeve van het onderzoek tijdens een vlucht. Op deze schema's dienen de totale afmetingen van de ijkdoelen, de ligging en het soort terrein waarop zij zijn gelegen, alsmede de informatie betreffende elk type ijkdoel, als bepaald in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing, te zijn vermeld.  

### AFDELING  II  

####HET VERRICHTEN VAN HET ONDERZOEK TIJDENS EEN VLUCHT

### 1  

Teneinde de grondresolutie van panorama-camera's of verticaal aangebrachte fotocamera's vast te stellen, loopt de vluchtlijn van het observatievliegtuig rechtstreeks over en parallel aan het ijkdoel. Teneinde de grondresolutie van schuin aangebrachte fotocamera's vast te stellen, loopt de vluchtlijn van het observatievliegtuig op zodanige afstand parallel aan het ijkdoel, dat het beeld van het ijkdoel op de voorgrond van het gezichtsveld van de optische camera verschijnt, ingesteld op de grootste hoek ten opzichte van het horizontale vlak, dan wel op de kleinste hoek ten opzichte van het verticale vlak.  

### 2  

Teneinde de grondresolutie van een infrarood-lijnaftasttoestel vast te stellen, loopt de vluchtlijn van het observatievliegtuig rechtstreeks over en parallel aan het ijkdoel op overeengekomen hoogten boven de grond.  

### 3  

Teneinde de grondresolutie van zijwaarts gerichte radars met synthetische apertuur vast te stellen, loopt de vluchtlijn van het observatievliegtuig ter zijde van de groep hoekreflectoren.  

### AFDELING  III  

####ANALYSE VAN DE IN DE LOOP VAN HET ONDERZOEK TIJDENS EEN VLUCHT VERZAMELDE GEGEVENS

### 1  

Na het onderzoek tijdens een vlucht analyseren de Staat-Partij die de certificering verricht en de Staten-Partijen die aan de certificering deelnemen gezamenlijk de gegevens die zijn verzameld in de loop van het onderzoek tijdens een vlucht overeenkomstig Afdeling IV, paragraaf 1, van Bijlage D bij het Verdrag.  

### 2  

De methode voor de berekening van de minimumhoogte boven de grond waarbij elke aan boord van het observatievliegtuig aangebrachte optische camera tijdens een observatievlucht mag worden bediend, met inbegrip van de bij deze berekening te hanteren contrastverhouding dan wel de daarmee overeenkomende modulatie, die ten minste 1,6 : 1 (overeenkomend met 0,23) en ten hoogste 4 : 1 (overeenkomend met 0,6) bedraagt, wordt in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie bepaald gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing, doch vóór 30 juni 1992. De grondresolutie van optische camera's wordt bepaald door middel van een visuele analyse van het beeld van het ijkdoel op het oorspronkelijke negatief. De getalswaarde van de grondresolutie moet gelijk zijn aan de breedte van de smalste streep van het ijkdoel die als afzonderlijke streep te onderscheiden is.  

### 3  

De methode voor de berekening van de minimumhoogte boven de grond waarbij elke aan boord van het observatievliegtuig aangebrachte videocamera tijdens een observatievlucht mag worden bediend, wordt in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie bepaald gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing.  

### 4  

De methode voor de berekening van de minimumhoogte boven de grond waarbij een aan boord van het observatievliegtuig aangebracht infrarood-Iijnaftasttoestel tijdens een observatievlucht mag worden bediend, met inbegrip van de waarde van het bij deze berekening te hanteren minimale waarneembare temperatuurverschil, wordt in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie bepaald gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing.  

### 5  

De methode voor de berekening van de grondresolutie van een zijwaarts gerichte radar met synthetische apertuur, met inbegrip van het resultaat van de vergelijking van de impulsresponsmethode met de objectscheidingsmethode, wordt in het kader van de „Open Luchtruim"-Overlegcommissie bepaald gedurende het tijdvak van voorlopige toepassing.  

### Bijlage  E  

####Procedures inzake de aankomst en het vertrek

### 1  

Elke Staat-Partij wijst één of meer punten van binnenkomst, één of meer punten van vertrek en één of meer „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden op zijn grondgebied aan. De punten van binnenkomst en de punten van vertrek kunnen „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden zijn. Indien een „open luchtruim"-vliegveld geen punt van binnenkomst is, dient tenzij anders is overeengekomen - een „open luchtruim"-vliegveld te worden aangewezen dat de observerende Partij binnen vijf uur kan bereiken vanaf het punt van binnenkomst, hetzij met haar eigen observatievliegtuig, hetzij met het door de geobserveerde Partij ter beschikking gestelde vervoermiddel. De observerende Partij heeft na aankomst op een punt van binnenkomst of een „open luchtruim"-vliegveld het recht op een rustperiode, zulks met inachtneming van de bepalingen van artikel VI van het Verdrag.  

### 2  

Elke Staat-Partij heeft het recht binnenkomstposities en vertrekposities aan te wijzen. Indien een Staat-Partij besluit binnenkomst- en vertrekposities aan te wijzen, dienen deze posities de vlucht van het grondgebied van de observerende Partij naar het punt van binnenkomst van de geobserveerde Partij te vergemakkelijken. Geplande vluchten tussen binnenkomstposities en punten van binnenkomst en tussen punten van vertrek en vertrekposities worden uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met bekendgemaakte normen en aanbevelingen van de ICAO en nationale voorschriften. Ingeval delen van de vluchten tussen binnenkomstposities en punten van binnenkomst en punten van vertrek en vertrekposities in het internationale luchtruim zijn gelegen, wordt de vlucht door het internationale luchtruim uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met bekendgemaakte internationale voorschriften.  

### 3  

Informatie over de punten van binnenkomst en de punten van vertrek, de „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden, de binnenkomstposities en de vertrekposities, de bijtankvliegvelden en de ijkdoelen is vooralsnog de informatie als vermeld in Aanhangsel I bij deze Bijlage.  

### 4  

Een Staat-Partij heeft het recht wijzigingen aan te brengen in Aanhangsel I bij deze Bijlage door alle andere Staten-Partijen daarvan schriftelijk in kennis te stellen, zulks ten minste 90 dagen voordat die wijzigingen van kracht worden.  

### 5  

Elke Staat-Partij waarborgt een doeltreffende observatie van zijn gehele grondgebied op de volgende wijze: 

A. op het vasteland worden de „open luchtruim"-vliegvelden zo aangewezen, dat geen enkel punt op zijn grondgebied op grotere afstand van één of meer van deze vliegvelden is gelegen dan 35 procent van de maximale vliegafstand(en) van die Staat-Partij overeenkomstig Bijlage A bij het Verdrag;  

B. op delen van zijn grondgebied die van het vasteland zijn gescheiden: 

1. past die Staat-Partij de bepalingen van letter A van deze paragraaf toe; of  

2. past die Staat-Partij, ingeval dat gebiedsdeel of die gebiedsdelen meer dan 600 kilometer van het vasteland is c.q. zijn gelegen, of indien zulks is overeengekomen tussen die Staat-Partij en de observerende Partij, dan wel indien anders is bepaald in Bijlage A, bijzondere procedures toe, waaronder het eventuele gebruik van bijtankvliegvelden; of  

3. kan die Staat-Partij, ingeval dat gebiedsdeel of die gebiedsdelen minder dan 600 kilometer van het vasteland is c.q. zijn gelegen en niet onder de bepalingen van letter A van deze paragraaf valt c.q. vallen, daarvoor een afzonderlijke maximale vliegafstand aangeven in Bijlage A.      

### 6  

Onmiddellijk na de aankomst van een observatievliegtuig op het punt van binnenkomst en onmiddellijk vóór het vertrek van een observatievliegtuig van het punt van vertrek inspecteren de observerende en de geobserveerde Partij de overeenkomstig artikel IV, Afdeling 1, vierde lid, aangebrachte kappen voor de sensoraperturen en de andere inrichtingen die het gebruik van de sensoren verhinderen. Ingeval het punt van binnenkomst niet het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld is waar de observatievlucht aanvangt, inspecteren de observerende en de geobserveerde Partij de kappen voor de sensoraperturen en de andere inrichtingen die het gebruik van de sensoren verhinderen onmiddellijk vóór het vertrek van het observatievliegtuig van het punt van binnenkomst naar het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld waar de observatievlucht aanvangt. Ingeval het punt van vertrek niet het „open luchtruim" -vliegveld is waar de observatievlucht eindigt, inspecteren de observerende en de geobserveerde Partij de kappen voor de sensoraperturen en de andere inrichtingen die het gebruik van de sensoren verhinderen onmiddellijk vóór het vertrek van het observatievliegtuig van dat vliegveld naar het punt van vertrek.  

### 7  

Een Staat-Partij heeft het recht een onderzoek en een inventarisatie te verrichten met betrekking tot de voorwerpen die de andere Staat-Partij voornemens is te gebruiken ten behoeve van het verrichten van een aan de vlucht voorafgaande inspectie van de sensoren en, indien van toepassing, van het observatievliegtuig, alsmede met betrekking tot de voorwerpen die de vluchtwaarnemers voornemens zijn mede aan boord te nemen. Dit onderzoek en deze inventarisatie: 

A. dienen uiterlijk een half uur na de aankomst van de desbetreffende voorwerpen op het punt van binnenkomst of het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld, naar keuze van de Staat-Partij die de inventarisatie verricht, te beginnen en binnen één uur te zijn beëindigd; en  

B. dienen te worden uitgevoerd in aanwezigheid van één of meer door de andere Staat-Partij aangewezen personen.    

### 8  

Indien de Staat-Partij die het onderzoek en de inventarisatie verricht gedurende het onderzoek en de inventarisatie met betrekking tot voorwerpen die worden gebruikt bij de inspectie van de sensoren en, indien van toepassing, van het observatievliegtuig, alsmede met betrekking tot de voorwerpen die de vluchtwaarnemers voornemens zijn mede aan boord van het observatievliegtuig te nemen, vaststelt dat de voorwerpen niet in overeenstemming zijn met de lijst van toegestane voorwerpen als bedoeld in Bijlage D, Afdeling II, paragraaf 5, of met de voorwerpen als omschreven in Bijlage G, Afdeling I, paragraaf 4, heeft deze het recht te weigeren toestemming te verlenen voor het gebruik van die voorwerpen. Voorwerpen ten aanzien waarvan zulks is vastgesteld en die door de observerende Partij op het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij zijn gebracht, worden, tenzij anders is overeengekomen: 

A. in een verzegelde houder op een veilige plaats bewaard; en  

B. vervolgens bij de eerstkomende gelegenheid, doch uiterlijk bij het vertrek van de observerende Partij, van het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij verwijderd.    

### 9  

Ingeval de observerende Partij reist naar het punt van binnenkomst, als genoemd in de ingevolge artikel VI, Afdeling I, vijfde lid, van dit Verdrag verstrekte kennisgeving, met gebruikmaking van een transportvliegtuig dat is ingeschreven bij de observerende Staat-Partij of bij een andere Staat-Partij, mag dit transportvliegtuig: 

A. vertrekken van het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij;  

B. ingeval het punt van binnenkomst hetzelfde is als het punt van vertrek, op het punt van binnenkomst blijven tot het vertrek van de observerende Partij van het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij; of  

C. ingeval het punt van binnenkomst niet hetzelfde is als het punt van vertrek, tijdig naar het punt van vertrek vliegen, zodat de bemanning nog voldoende rust kan nemen vóór het vertrek van al het personeel van de observerende Partij van het grondgebied van de geobserveerde Partij.    

### 10  

Ingeval het observatievliegtuig door de geobserveerde Partij ter beschikking wordt gesteld en de observerende Partij geen gebruik maakt van haar eigen transportvliegtuig om haar personeel te vervoeren van het punt van binnenkomst naar het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld, draagt de geobserveerde Partij er zorg voor dat het personeel van de observerende Partij wordt vervoerd van het punt van binnenkomst naar het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld en van het „open luchtruim"-vliegveld naar het punt van vertrek.
