####Agreed Minutes

The representatives of the Governments of the Benelux countries and the representatives of the Government of Japan hereby record the following understandings which have been reached during the course of the negotiations between their respective delegations for the conclusion of the Agreement on Commerce between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Belgo-Luxemburg Economic Union on the One Hand and Japan on the Other Hand, signed today:     
### PART  A  

### 1  

During the course of the negotiations for the conclusion of the Agreement on Commerce, the Benelux Delegation and the Japanese Delegation exchanged their views on the invocation by the Benelux countries against Japan of Article XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  

### 2  

The Japanese Delegation expressed their regret that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had not been applied between Japan and the Benelux countries.  

### 3  

To this, the Benelux Delegation stated that the reason for the invocation of Article XXXV was the apprehension felt in the Benelux countries for a possible disruption of the Benelux market by an abrupt increase in the volume, or excessive fluctuations in the price, of the imports from Japan and that the withdrawal of the invocation of Article XXXV was difficult unless such apprehension became groundless by some appropriate measures.  

### 4  

Accordingly, the Benelux Delegation stated that their Governments would undertake: 

(a) to keep under constant review the possibility of withdrawing the invocation of Article XXXV in the light of the experiences which they would gain under the Agreement on Commerce, and to exchange views from time to time with the Government of Japan on this issue, and  

(b) 

(1) to endeavour, cooperating with the Government of Japan, to attain a general und multilateral solution of the problem of “avoidance of market disruption” within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and  

(2) to withdraw the invocation of Article XXXV against Japan as soon as a solution envisaged above, which is acceptable both to the Benelux countries and Japan could be achieved, and    

(c) to enter into discussion with the Government of Japan at an appropriate time well before the end of the three year period of the Agreement on Commerce to examine the possibility of applying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade between the Benelux countries and Japan, in case the multilateral solution referred to in above (*b*) should fail to materialize within the two year period after the date of coming into force of the Agreement on Commerce.    

### 5  

The Japanese Delegation appreciated the above statement made by the Benelux Delegation and stated that the Government of Japan would cooperate with the Governments of the Benelux countries in every possible way in order to move towards the application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade between Japan and the Benelux countries.  

### PART  B  

### 1  

The Benelux Delegation asked for guarantees with regard to the exports from their countries to Japan, in particular for the products a list of which was handed over to the Japanese Delegation, and learned with much regret that Japan was not in a position to give special guarantees to the Benelux countries as this was considered contrary to the policy of the Government of Japan of abolishing existing bilateral quotas.  

### 2  

The Japanese Delegation explained that the importation of products originating in the Benelux countries into Japan was carried out under the existing import systems such as the Automatic Approval System, the Automatic Fund Allocation System and the global quotas under the Fund Allocation System, and that, within the framework of these import systems, the products originating in the Benelux countries were admitted on a non-discriminatory basis. The Japanese Delegation explained further that the Automatic Approval System could be considered in practice as equivalent to liberalization.  

### 3  

As to the global quotas, the Benelux Delegation expressed the desire for the increase of such quotas for a number of commodities so as to accommodate the wish of exporters in the Benelux countries to increase exports to Japan and to develop business relations with Japanese importers who had no past records of imports from the Benelux countries. The Japanese Delegation took note of this desire, but pointed out that inasmuch as the Japanese importers were free to import from any source of their own choice, it was basically up to the efforts of Benelux exporters to obtain a share in a global quota. However, the Japanese Delegation stated that it was the intention of their Government to increase, within the framework of their liberalization programme which was aimed at the progressive relaxation and eventual removal of present quantitative import restrictions, global quotas whenever possible, taking into account the desire expressed by the Benelux Delegation.  

### 4  

The Japanese Delegation added that the Government of Japan were prepared to provide equivalent import possibilities for the products of the Benelux countries so far as import possibilities were given to similar products of any other country or countries, and also to let products of the Benelux countries participate in the existing partial global quotas.  

### PART  C  

### 1  

During the discussions in connection with the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Second Protocol, the Benelux Delegation stated that, although their Government had been applying in general a liberal licensing policy to imports from Japan, quantitative import restrictions were maintained at present with regard to some specific products, such restrictions being deemed essential in view of the special situation which would be created by some Japanese exports, and that, as a sudden removal of restrictions on the import of the products mentioned in the List appended hereto would result in serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products, their Governments would not be in a position to remove these restrictions simultaneously with the coming into force of the Agreement on Commerce.  

### 2  

Accordingly, the Benelux Delegation stated that their Governments wished to propose to the Government of Japan that: 

(a) During the initial one year period of the Agreement, importation into the European territories of the Benelux countries of the products enumerated in the List would be authorized at least up to the amounts of quantities indicated in the List. The Governments of the Benelux countries would keep under constant review the possibilities of increasing the above amounts or quantities;  

(b) 

(1) Should maintenance of restrictions on such products in the second year or thereafter be felt indispensable in the light of the purport of paragraph 6 (*a*) of the Second Protocol, the Governments of the Benelux countries and the Government of Japan would enter into consultations with each other in advance of the commencement of the period, and, in the light of the experiences and data obtained by that time, would agree on the products on which restrictions could be maintained and the amounts or quantities of import authorization for such products, provided that in no event the scope of restrictions to be agreed upon would exceed that of the previous year;  

(2) In the event that no agreement could be reached in respect of specific products through the consultations mentioned in (1) above, the amounts or quantities of actual import authorization for the previous year or the amounts or quantities agreed upon for that year, whichever is larger, would remain valid in the ensuing year.      

### 3  

The Benelux Delegation stated that in the administration of these import restrictions, and in the consultations pertaining thereto as well as in all other matters connected with these restrictions, the Governments of the Benelux countries would be guided by the principles presented in paragraph 6 (*b*) of the Second Protocol, and that they undertook to remove such restrictions as soon as possible for the earliest realisation of the full application of Article II of the Agreement on Commerce.  

### 4  

The Japanese Delegation stated that under these circumstances the above proposal was acceptable to the Government of Japan. Furthermore the Japanese Delegation stated that the Government of Japan undertook to seek, individually, and in cooperation with the Governments of the Benelux countries, as well as in the multilateral framework, a solution for the special situation to which the Benelux Delegation referred, and which they considered as the only reason for the maintenance of the restrictions concerned. The Japanese Delegation further stated that the Government of Japan would, while considering the measures provided for in PART B of the Agreed Minutes, take into consideration the progress in the relaxation of the import restrictions on these items achieved in the future as a result of the undertakings of the Governments concerned referred to above.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned representatives have signed on behalf of their respective Governments the present Agreed Minutes. DONE at Tokyo, in triplicate in the English language, this eighth day of October, nineteen hundred and sixty.

Indien er naar de mening van één der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen redelijke bewijzen voorhanden zijn, dat enig produkt van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij tengevolge van onvoorziene ontwikkelingen onder zodanige omstandigheden in haar grondgebied wordt ingevoerd, dat het ernstige schade berokkent of dreigt te berokkenen aan haar binnenlandse producenten van gelijksoortige of rechtstreeks concurrerende produkten en dat zekere maatregelen nodig zijn om deze schade te voorkomen of te herstellen, stelt zij de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij schriftelijk hiervan in kennis. De Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen treden na zulk een kennisgeving onmiddellijk met elkander in overleg teneinde tot een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing te geraken.  

2. Indien het bovenbedoelde overleg binnen een redelijk tijdsbestek niet tot een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing leidt, kan de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ten aanzien van het betrokken produkt haar uit de Overeenkomst voortvloeiende verplichtingen in zoverre en zo lang opschorten als nodig is om de schade te voorkomen of te herstellen.  

3. In kritieke omstandigheden, wanneer uitstel schade zou veroorzaken die moeilijk zou zijn te herstellen, kan krachtens paragraaf 2 hierboven voorlopig worden opgetreden nadat de in paragraaf 1 hierboven genoemde kennisgeving is gedaan of voordat het in die paragraaf bedoelde overleg ten einde is, mits zodanig overleg wordt voortgezet met het doel om een wederzijds bevredigende oplossing te vinden.  

4. 

a) Indien de uitvoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij meent, dat de maatregelen die de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij krachtens paragraaf 2 of 3 van dit Protocol heeft genomen, zulk een aantal produkten of zulk een handels volumen treffen, dat de belangen der uitvoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij ernstig worden benadeeld, kan zij om schriftelijk overleg verzoeken met de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aangaande de toestand die zich heeft ontwikkeld, de genomen maatregelen daaronder begrepen.  

b) Indien binnen een redelijk tijdsbestek geen voldoende overeenstemming kan worden bereikt, kan de uitvoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij haar uit de Overeenkomst voortvloeiende verplichtingen in zoverre opschorten, als nagenoeg overeenkomt met de uitwerking der door de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij genomen maatregelen.  

c) Indien de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij haar krachtens dit Protocol genomen maatregelen opheft, beëindigt de uitvoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij terstond de opschorting van haar verplichtingen.    

5. Ingeval het bepaalde in paragraaf 2, 3 of 4 hierboven wordt toegepast, doen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, zowel elk afzonderlijk als allen tezamen, al het mogelijke, opdat de in de Overeenkomst beoogde toestanden zo volledig en spoedig mogelijk worden hersteld.  

6. 

a) Ingeval er bij een der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen invoerbeperkingen ten aanzien van bepaalde produkten van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij aanhoudend van kracht zijn geweest en de plotselinge opheffing van de beperkingen op deze produkten tot ernstige schade voor de binnenlandse producenten van gelijksoortige of rechtstreeks Concurrerende produkten zou leiden, kan de invoerende Overeenkomstsluitende Partij, bij wijze van overgangsmaatregel, door de Regeringen der Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen overeen te komen invoerbeperkingen toepassen.  

b) De Overeenkomstsluitende Partij die bovengenoemde beperkingen toepast, verbindt zich: 

(i) aan de handel van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Partij een billijk en redelijk aandeel in de markt te gunnen en  

(ii) een beleid te voeren, dat erop gericht is de beperkingen ten spoedigste te verzachten of op te heffen.      

7. Wanneer de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handen van toepassing wordt tussen de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen, terwijl de Overeenkomst van kracht blijft ingevolge artikel VII daarvan, treedt dit Protocol onmiddellijk buiten werking.

####Vastgestelde Notulen

De vertegenwoordigers van de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen en de vertegenwoordigers van de Regering van Japan verklaren hierbij, dat zij gedurende de loop der onderhandelingen tussen hun respectieve delegaties voor het afsluiten van de Handelsovereenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Belgisch-Luxemburgse Economische Unie, enerzijds, en Japan, anderzijds, welke heden werd ondertekend, het volgende zijn overeengekomen:     
### DEEL  A  

### 1  

Gedurende de onderhandelingen ter afsluiting van de Handelsovereenkomst hebben de Benelux Delegatie en de Japanse Delegatie van gedachten gewisseld over het beroep dat de Benelux-landen tegenover Japan hebben gedaan op artikel XXXV van de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handel.  

### 2  

De Japanse Delegatie heeft er haar leedwezen over uitgesproken, dat de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handel niet van toepassing is geweest tussen Japan en de Benelux-landen.  

### 3  

Hierop heeft de Benelux Delegatie verklaard, dat het beroep op artikel XXXV was gedaan, omdat men in de Benelux-landen vreesde voor een mogelijke ontwrichting van de Benelux-markt door een plotselinge toeneming van de hoeveelheid, of door buitensporige schommelingen in de prijs, van de invoer uit Japan, en dat het beroep op artikel XXXV moeilijk kon worden ingetrokken, tenzij aan deze vrees de grond werd ontnomen door enige daartoe geëigende maatregelen.  

### 4  

De Benelux Delegatie heeft dienovereenkomstig verklaard, dat haar Regeringen zich zouden verbinden om: 

(a) voortdurend aandacht te schenken aan de mogelijkheid het beroep op artikel XXXV in te trekken in het licht van de ervaringen die zij met de Handelsovereenkomst opdoen, en van tijd tot tijd met de Regering van Japan over dit onderwerp van gedachten te wisselen, en  

(b) 

(1) te trachten, tezamen met de Regering van Japan, binnen het kader van de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handel een algemene en multilaterale oplossing te bereiken van het probleem, hoe ontwrichting van de markt is te vermijden, en  

(2) het beroep op artikel XXXV tegenover Japan in te trekken, zodra een oplossing als bovenbedoeld, welke voor de Beneluxlanden zowel als voor Japan aanvaardbaar is, is gevonden, en    

(c) op een passend tijdstip, geruime tijd voor het einde van de periode van drie jaar gedurende welke de Handelsovereenkomst van kracht is, besprekingen met de Regering van Japan te openen teneinde de mogelijkheid te onderzoeken de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handel tussen de Benelux-landen en Japan toe te passen, in geval de in *b* hierboven genoemde oplossing niet tot stand zou komen binnen twee jaar nadat de Handelsovereenkomst van kracht is geworden.    

### 5  

De Japanse Delegatie heeft de bovenvermelde verklaring van de Benelux Delegatie op prijs gesteld en heeft verklaard, dat de Regering van Japan zoveel mogelijk met de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen zal medewerken teneinde tot de toepassing van de Algemene Overeenkomst betreffende Tarieven en Handel tussen Japan en de Benelux-landen te geraken.  

### DEEL  B  

### 1  

De Benelux Delegatie heeft om waarborgen gevraagd met betrekking tot de uitvoer uit haar landen naar Japan, in het bijzonder ten aanzien van de produkten waarvan aan de Japanse Delegatie een lijst werd overhandigd, en heeft met veel leedwezen vernomen, dat Japan niet in staat was de Benelux-landen bijzondere waarborgen te verstrekken, aangezien dit in strijd werd geacht met het streven van de Regering van Japan bestaande bilaterale contingenten af te schaffen.  

### 2  

De Japanse Delegatie heeft uiteengezet, dat de invoer in Japan van produkten afkomstig uit de Benelux-landen plaatsvindt overeenkomstig de bestaande invoersystemen, zoals het Automatische Goedkeuringssysteem, het systeem van Automatische Toewijzing van Gelden en de globale contingenten krachtens het systeem van Automatische Toewijzing van Gelden, en dat de produkten afkomstig uit de Benelux-landen binnen het kader van deze invoersystemen toegelaten worden op basis van non-discriminatie. Voorts heeft de Japanse Delegatie uiteengezet, dat het Automatische Goedkeuringssysteem beschouwd kan worden als praktisch gelijkstaand aan liberalisatie.  

### 3  

Ten aanzien van de globale contingenten heeft de Benelux Delegatie de wens te kennen gegeven, dat deze contingenten voor een aantal produkten worden verhoogd teneinde tegemoet te komen aan het verlangen van exporteurs in de Benelux-landen om de uitvoer naar Japan te vergroten en handelsbetrekkingen aan te knopen met Japanse importeurs die nog niet eerder uit de Benelux-landen hebben ingevoerd. De Japanse Delegatie heeft nota genomen van deze wens, doch heeft erop gewezen, dat, aangezien de Japanse importeurs vrij zijn in te voeren uit welke bron hunner keuze ook, het in de eerste plaats de zaak van de Benelux-exporteurs is een aandeel in een globaal contingent te verkrijgen. De Japanse Delegatie heeft echter verklaard, dat het in het voornemen van haar Regering ligt, binnen het kader van haar liberalisatieprogramma, dat de geleidelijke verzachting en uiteindelijke opheffing van de huidige kwantitatieve invoerbeperkingen ten doel heeft, de globale contingenten voor zover mogelijk te verhogen, zulks met inachtneming van de door de Benelux Delegatie uitgesproken wens.  

### 4  

De Japanse Delegatie heeft hieraan toegevoegd, dat de Regering van Japan bereid is overeenkomstige invoermogelijkheden open te stellen voor de produkten uit de Benelux-landen, voor zover invoermogelijkheden zijn verschaft voor soortgelijke produkten uit enig ander land of andere landen, alsook produkten uit de Benelux-landen te laten deelnemen in de bestaande gedeeltelijk globale contingenten.  

### DEEL  C  

### 1  

Gedurende de besprekingen in verband met de bepalingen van paragraaf 6 van het Tweede Protocol, heeft de Benelux Delegatie verklaard, dat, ofschoon haar Regeringen in het algemeen een liberale vergunningenpolitiek hebben gevoerd ten aanzien van de invoer uit Japan, er heden met betrekking tot enkele bepaalde produkten kwantitatieve invoerbeperkingen gehandhaafd worden, welke noodzakelijk worden geacht met het oog op de bijzondere situatie die door sommige Japanse uitvoeren zou ontstaan, en dat, aangezien een plotselinge opheffing van beperkingen van de invoer van de op de aangehechte Lijst genoemde produkten de binnenlandse producenten van gelijke of rechtstreeks concurrerende produkten ernstige schade zou doen lijden, haar Regeringen niet in staat zijn deze beperkingen op te heffen te zelfder tijd dat de Handelsovereenkomst van kracht wordt.  

### 2  

De Benelux Delegatie heeft dienovereenkomstig verklaard, dat haar Regeringen aan de Regering van Japan het volgende wensen voor te stellen: 

(a) Gedurende het eerste jaar van de Overeenkomst wordt invoer in de Europese gebieden van de Benelux-landen van de op de Lijst vermelde produkten tot tenminste de op de Lijst aangegeven bedragen of hoeveelheden toegestaan. De Regeringen van de Benelux-landen zullen de mogelijkheden de bovenvermelde bedragen of hoeveelheden te verhogen, voortdurend bezien.  

(b) 

(1) Mocht in het tweede jaar of daarna de handhaving van beperkingen ten aanzien van deze produkten noodzakelijk worden geacht, gezien de strekking van paragraaf 6 (*a*) van het Tweede Protocol, dan treden de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen en de Regering van Japan voor de aanvang van de nieuwe periode met elkaar in overleg en stellen op basis van de tegen die tijd verkregen ervaringen en gegevens de produkten vast ten aanzien waarvan beperkingen gehandhaafd kunnen blijven, alsmede de bedragen of hoeveelheden der in voermachtigingen voor deze produkten, met dien verstande dat de omvang van de overeen te komen beperkingen in geen geval die van het voorgaande jaar overtreft;  

(2) In geval de onder (1) hierboven vermelde besprekingen niet tot overeenstemming mochten leiden ten aanzien van bepaalde produkten, blijven de bedragen of hoeveelheden van de in het voorgaande jaar verleende invoermachtigingen of, zo deze hoger mochten zijn, de voor dat jaar overeengekomen bedragen of hoeveelheden, geldig voor het daarop volgende jaar.      

### 3  

De Benelux Delegatie heeft verklaard, dat de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen zich bij de uitvoering van deze invoerbeperkingen en bij de besprekingen dienaangaande, alsook bij alle andere aangelegenheden betreffende deze beperkingen, zullen laten leiden door de in paragraaf 6 (*b*) van het Tweede Protocol uiteengezette beginselen, en dat zij zich verbinden deze beperkingen ten spoedigste op te heffen teneinde de volledige toepassing van artikel II van de Handelsovereenkomst op een zo vroeg mogelijk tijdstip te verwezenlijken.  

### 4  

De Japanse Delegatie heeft verklaard, dat het bovengenoemde voorstel onder deze omstandigheden voor de Regering van Japan aanvaardbaar is. Voorts heeft de Japanse Delegatie verklaard, dat de Regering van Japan zich verbindt, individueel en in samenwerking met de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen, alsook in multilateraal verband, een oplossing te zoeken voor de bijzondere toestand waarop door de Regeringen van de Benelux-landen gedoeld wordt, en welke naar hun mening de enige reden voor de handhaving van de betrokken beperkingen is. De Japanse Delegatie heeft voorts verklaard, dat de Regering van Japan, met inachtneming van de maatregelen voorzien in deel B van de Vastgestelde Notulen, de in de toekomst als gevolg van de bovenvermelde toezeggingen der betrokken Regeringen gemaakte vorderingen in de verzachting van de invoerbeperkingen op deze artikelen in overweging zal nemen.  

TEN BLIJKE WAARVAN de ondergetekende vertegenwoordigers in naam van hun respectieve Regeringen deze Vastgestelde Notulen hebben ondertekend. GEDAAN te Tokio, in drievoud in de Engelse taal, de achtste dag van oktober negentienhonderd zestig.

Ik zou het op prijs stellen, indien Uwe Excellentie de bovengenoemde opvatting namens de Regering van Japan zou bevestigen.
