####Revised General Act for the pacific settlement of international disputes

### CHAPTER  I  

#### *Conciliation* 

### Article  1  

Disputes of every kind between two or more Parties to the present General Act which it has not been possible to settle by diplomacy shall, subject to such reservations as may be made under article 39, be submitted, under the conditions laid down in the present chapter, to the procedure of conciliation.  

### Article  2  

The disputes referred to in the preceding article shall be submitted to a permanent or special conciliation commission constituted by the parties to the dispute.  

### Article  3  

On a request to that effect being made by one of the Contracting Parties to another party, a permanent conciliation commission shall be constituted within a period of six months.  

### Article  4  

Unless the parties concerned agree otherwise, the Conciliation Commission shall be constituted as follows: 

(1) The Commission shall be composed of five members. The parties shall each nominate one commissioner, who may be chosen from among their respective nationals. The three other commissioners shall be appointed by agreement from among the nationals of third Powers. These three commissioners must be of different nationalities and must not be habitually resident in the territory nor be in the service of the parties. The parties shall appoint the President of the Commission from among them.  

(2) The commissioners shall be appointed for three years. They shall be re-eligible. The commissioners appointed jointly may be replaced during the course of their mandate by agreement between the parties. Either party may, however, at any time replace a commissioner whom it has appointed. Even if replaced, the commissioners shall continue to exercise their functions until the termination of the work in hand.  

(3) Vacancies which may occur as a result of death, resignation or any other cause shall be filled within the shortest possible time in the manner fixed for the nominations.    

### Article  5  

If, when a dispute arises, no permanent conciliation commission appointed by the parties is in existence, a special commission shall be constituted for the examination of the dispute within a period of three months from the date at which a request to that effect is made by one of the parties to the other party. The necessary appointments shall be made in the manner laid down in the preceding article, unless the parties decide otherwise.  

### Article  6  

1.  If the appointment of the commissioners to be designated jointly is not made within the periods provided for in articles 3 and 5, the making of the necessary appointments shall be entrusted to a third Power, chosen by agreement between the parties, or on request of the parties, to the President of the General Assembly, or, if the latter is not in session, to the last President.   
2.  If no agreement is reached on either of these procedures, each party shall designate a different Power, and the appointment shall be made in concert by the Powers thus chosen.   
3.  If, within a period of three months, the two Powers have been unable to reach an agreement, each of them shall submit a number of candidates equal to the number of members to be appointed. It shall then be decided by lot which of the candidates thus designated shall be appointed.   

### Article  7  

1.  Disputes shall be brought before the Conciliation Commission by means of an application addressed to the President by the two parties acting in agreement, or in default thereof by one or other of the parties.   
2.  The application, after giving a summary account of the subject of the dispute, shall contain the invitation to the Commission to take all necessary measures with a view to arriving at an amicable solution.   
3.  If the application emanates from only one of the parties, the other party shall, without delay, be notified by it.   

### Article  8  

1.  Within fifteen days from the date on which a dispute has been brought by one of the parties before a permanent conciliation commission, either party may replace its own commissioner, for the examination of the particular dispute, by a person possessing special competence in the matter.   
2.  The party making use of this right shall immediately notify the other party; the latter shall, in such case, be entitled to take similar action within fifteen days from the date on which it received the notification.   

### Article  9  

1.  In the absence of agreement to the contrary between the parties, the Conciliation Commission shall meet at the seat of the United Nations, or at some other place selected by its President.   
2.  The Commission may in all circumstances request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to afford it his assistance.   

### Article  10  

The work of the Conciliation Commission shall not be conducted in public unless a decision to that effect is taken by the Commission with the consent of the parties.  

### Article  11  

1.  In the absence of agreement to the contrary between the parties, the Conciliation Commission shall lay down its own procedure, which in any case must provide for both parties being heard. In regard to enquiries, the Commission, unless it decides unanimously to the contrary, shall act in accordance with the provisions of part III of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.   
2.  The parties shall be represented before the Conciliation Commission by agents, whose duty shall be to act as intermediaries between them and the Commission; they may, moreover, be assisted by counsel and experts appointed by them for that purpose and may request that all persons whose evidence appears to them desirable shall be heard.   
3.  The Commission, for its part, shall be entitled to request oral explanations from the agents, counsel and experts of both parties, as well as from all persons it may think desirable to summon with the consent of their Governments.   

### Article  12  

In the absence of agreement to the contrary between the parties, the decisions of the Conciliation Commission shall be taken by a majority vote, and the Commission may only take decisions on the substance of the dispute if all its members are present.  

### Article  13  

The parties undertake to facilitate the work of the Conciliation Commission, and particularly to supply it to the greatest possible extent with all relevant documents and information, as well as to use the means at their disposal to allow it to proceed in their territory, and in accordance with their law, to the summoning and hearing of witnesses or experts and to visit the localities in question.  

### Article  14  

1.  During the proceedings of the Commission, each of the commissioners shall receive emoluments the amount of which shall be fixed by agreement between the parties, each of which shall contribute an equal share.   
2.  The general expenses arising out of the working of the Commission shall be divided in the same manner.   

### Article  15  

1.  The task of the Conciliation Commission shall be to elucidate the questions in dispute, to collect with that object all necessary information by means of enquiry or otherwise, and to endeavour to bring the parties to an agreement. It may, after the case has been examined, inform the parties of the terms of settlement which seem suitable to it, and lay down the period within which they are to make their decision.   
2.  At the close of the proceedings the Commission shall draw up a *procès-verbal* stating, as the case may be, either that the parties have come to an agreement and, if need arises, the terms of the agreement, or that it has been impossible to effect a settlement. No mention shall be made in the *procès-verbal* of whether the Commission's decisions were taken unanimously or by a majority vote.   
3.  The proceedings of the Commission must, unless the parties otherwise agree, be terminated within six months from the date on which the Commission shall have been given cognizance of the dispute.   

### Article  16  

The Commission's *procès-verbal* shall be communicated without delay to the parties. The parties shall decide whether it shall be published.  

### CHAPTER  II  

#### *Judicial settlement* 

### Article  17  

All disputes with regard to which the parties are in conflict as to their respective rights shall, subject to any reservations which may be made under article 39, be submitted for decision to the International Court of Justice, unless the parties agree, in the manner hereinafter provided, to have resort to an arbitral tribunal. It is understood that the disputes referred to above include in particular those mentioned in Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.  

### Article  18  

If the parties agree to submit the disputes mentioned in the preceding article to an arbitral tribunal, they shall draw up a special agreement in which they shall specify the subject of the dispute, the arbitrators selected, and the procedure to be followed. In the absence of sufficient particulars in the special agreement, the provisions of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes shall apply so far as is necessary. If nothing is laid down in the special agreement as to the rules regarding the substance of the dispute to be followed by the arbitrators, the Tribunal shall apply the substantive rules enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.  

### Article  19  

If the parties fail to agree concerning the special agreement referred to in the preceding article, or fail to appoint arbitrators, either party shall be at liberty, after giving three months' notice, to bring the dispute by an application direct before the International Court of Justice.  

### Article  20  

1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of article 1, disputes of the kind referred to in article 17 arising between parties who have acceded to the obligations contained in the present chapter shall only be subject to the procedure of conciliation if the parties so agree.   
2.  The obligation to resort to the procedure of conciliation remains applicable to disputes which are excluded from judicial settlement only by the operation of reservations under the provisions of article 39.   
3.  In the event of recourse to and failure of conciliation, neither party may bring the dispute before the International Court of Justice or call for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal referred to in article 18 before the expiration of one month from the termination of the proceedings of the Conciliation Commission.   

### CHAPTER  III  

#### *Arbitration* 

### Article  21  

Any dispute not of the kind referred to in article 17 which does not, within the month following the termination of the work of the Conciliation Commission provided for in chapter I, form the object of an agreement between the parties, shall, subject to such reservations as may be made under article 39, be brought before an arbitral tribunal which, unless the parties otherwise agree, shall be constituted in the manner set out below.  

### Article  22  

The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of five members. The parties shall each nominate one member, who may be chosen from among their respective nationals. The other two arbitrators and the Chairman shall be chosen by common agreement from among the nationals of third Powers. They must be of different nationalities and must not be habitually resident in the territory nor be in the service of the parties.  

### Article  23  

1.  If the appointment of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal is not made within a period of three months from the date on which one of the parties requested the other party to constitute an arbitral tribunal, a third Power, chosen by agreement between the parties, shall be requested to make the necessary appointments.   
2.  If no agreement is reached on this point, each party shall designate a different Power, and the appointments shall be made in concert by the Powers thus chosen.   
3.  If, within a period of three months, the two Powers so chosen have been unable to reach an agreement, the necessary appointments shall be made by the President of the International Court of Justice. If the latter is prevented from acting or is a subject of one of the parties, the nominations shall be made by the Vice-President. If the latter is prevented from acting or is a subject of one of the parties, the appointments shall be made by the oldest member of the Court who is not a subject of either party.   

### Article  24  

Vacancies which may occur as a result of death, resignation or any other cause shall be filled within the shortest possible time in the manner fixed for the nominations.  

### Article  25  

The parties shall draw up a special agreement determining the subject of the disputes and the details of procedure.  

### Article  26  

In the absence of sufficient particulars in the special agreement regarding the matters referred to in the preceding article, the provisions of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes shall apply so far as is necessary.  

### Article  27  

Failing the conclusion of a special agreement within a period of three months from the date on which the Tribunal was constituted, the dispute may be brought before the Tribunal by an application by one or other party.  

### Article  28  

If nothing is laid down in the special agreement or no special agreement has been made, the Tribunal shall apply the rules in regard to the substance of the dispute enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In so far as there exists no such rule applicable to the dispute, the Tribunal shall decide *ex aequo et bono.*  

### CHAPTER  IV  

#### *General provisions* 

### Article  29  

1.  Disputes for the settlement of which a special procedure is laid down in other conventions in force between the parties to the dispute shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of those conventions.   
2.  The present General Act shall not affect any agreements in force by which conciliation procedure is established between the Parties or they are bound by obligations to resort to arbitration or judicial settlement which ensure the settlement of the dispute. If, however, these agreements provide only for a procedure of conciliation, after such procedure has been followed without result, the provisions of the present General Act concerning judicial settlement or arbitration shall be applied in so far as the parties have acceded thereto.   

### Article  30  

If a party brings before a Conciliation Commission a dispute which the other party, relying on conventions in force between the parties, has submitted to the International Court of Justice or an arbitral tribunal, the Commission shall defer consideration of the dispute until the Court or the Arbitral Tribunal has pronounced upon the conflict of competence. The same rule shall apply if the Court or the Tribunal is seized of the case by one of the parties during the conciliation proceedings.  

### Article  31  

1.  In the case of a dispute the occasion of which, according to the municipal law of one of the parties, falls within the competence of its judicial or administrative authorities, the party in question may object to the matter in dispute being submitted for settlement by the different methods laid down in the present General Act until a decision with final effect has been pronounced, within a reasonable time, by the competent authority.   
2.  In such a case, the party which desires to resort to the procedures laid down in the present General Act must notify the other party of its intention within a period of one year from the date of the aforementioned decision.   

### Article  32  

If, in a judicial sentence or arbitral award, it is declared that a judgment, or a measure enjoined by a court of law or other authority of one of the parties to the dispute, is wholly or in part contrary to international law, and if the constitutional law of that party does not permit or only partially permits the consequences of the judgment or measure in question to be annulled, the parties agree that the judicial sentence or arbitral award shall grant the injured party equitable satisfaction.  

### Article  33  

1.  In all cases where a dispute forms the object of arbitration or judicial proceedings, and particularly if the question on which the parties differ arises out of acts already committed or on the point of being committed, the International Court of Justice, acting in accordance with Article 41 of its Statute, or the Arbitral Tribunal, shall lay down within the shortest possible time the provisional measures to be adopted. The parties to the dispute shall be bound to accept such measures.   
2.  If the dispute is brought before a conciliation commission, the latter may recommend to the parties the adoption of such provisional measures as it considers suitable.   
3.  The parties undertake to abstain from all measures likely to react prejudicially upon the execution of the judicial or arbitral decision or upon the arrangements proposed by the Conciliation Commission and, in general, to abstain from any sort of action whatsoever which may aggravate or extend the dispute.   

### Article  34  

Should a dispute arise between more than two Parties to the present General Act, the following rules shall be observed for the application of the forms of procedure described in the foregoing provisions: 

(a) In the case of conciliation procedure, a special commission shall invariably be constituted. The composition of such commission shall differ according as the parties all have separate interests or as two or more of their number act together. In the former case, the parties shall each appoint one commissioner and shall jointly appoint commissioners nationals of third Powers not parties to the dispute, whose number shall always exceed by one the number of commissioners appointed separately by the parties. In the second case, the parties who act together shall appoint their commissioner jointly by agreement between themselves and shall combine with the other party or parties in appointing third commissioners. In either event, the parties, unless they agree otherwise, shall apply article 5 and the following articles of the present Act, so far as they are compatible with the provisions of the present article.  

(b) In the case of judicial procedure, the Statute of the International Court of Justice shall apply.  

(c) In the case of arbitral procedure, if agreement is not secured as to the composition of the Tribunal, in the case of the disputes mentioned in article 17, each party shall have the right, by means of an application, to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice; in the case of the disputes mentioned in article 21, the above article 22 and following articles shall apply, but each party having separate interests shall appoint one arbitrator and the number of arbitrators separately appointed by the parties to the dispute shall always be one less than that of the other arbitrators.    

### Article  35  

1.  The present General Act shall be applicable as between the Parties thereto, even though a third Power, whether a Party to the Act or not, has an interest in the dispute.   
2.  In conciliation procedure, the parties may agree to invite such third Power to intervene.   

### Article  36  

1.  In judicial or arbitral procedure, if a third Power should consider that it has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the case, it may submit to the International Court of Justice or to the Arbitral Tribunal a request to intervene as a third party.   
2.  It will be for the Court or the Tribunal to decide upon this request.   

### Article  37  

1.  Whenever the construction of a convention to which States other than those concerned in the case are parties is in question, the Registrar of the International Court of Justice or the Arbitral Tribunal shall notify all such States forthwith.   
2.  Every State so notified has the right to intervene in the proceedings; but, if it uses this right, the construction given by the decision will be binding upon it.   

### Article  38  

Accessions to the present General Act may extend: 

A. Either to all the provisions of the Act (chapters I, II, III and IV);  

B. Or to those provisions only which relate to conciliation and judicial settlement (chapters I and II), together with the general provisions dealing with these procedures (chapter IV);  

C. Or to those provisions only which relate to conciliation (chapter I), together with the general provisions concerning that procedure (chapter IV).   The Contracting Parties may benefit by the accessions of other Parties only in so far as they have themselves assumed the same obligations.  

### Article  39  

1.  In addition to the power given in the preceding article, a Party, in acceding to the present General Act, may make his acceptance conditional upon the reservations exhaustively enumerated in the following paragraph. These reservations must be indicated at the time of accession.   
2.  These reservations may be such as to exclude from the procedure described in the present Act: 

(a) Disputes arising out of facts prior to the accession either of the Party making the reservation or of any other Party with whom the said Party may have a dispute;  

(b) Disputes concerning questions which by international law are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of States;  

(c) Disputes concerning particular cases or clearly specified subject-matters, such as territorial status, or disputes failing within clearly defined categories.     
3.  If one of the parties to a dispute has made a reservation, the other parties may enforce the same reservation in regard to that party.   
4.  In the case of Parties who have acceded to the provisions of the present General Act relating to judicial settlement or to arbitration, such reservations as they may have made shall, unless otherwise expressly stated, be deemed not to apply to the procedure of conciliation.   

### Article  40  

A Party whose accession has been only partial, or was made subject to reservations, may at any moment, by means of a simple declaration, either extend the scope of his accession or abandon all or part of his reservations.  

### Article  41  

Disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the present General Act, including those concerning the classification of disputes and the scope of reservations, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice.  

### Article  42

2.  The instruments of accession and the additional declarations provided for by article 40 shall be transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall notify their receipt to all the Members of the United Nations and to the non-member States referred to in the preceding paragraph.   
3.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall draw up three lists, denominated respectively by the letters A, B and C, corresponding to the three forms of accession to the present Act provided for in article 38, in which shall be shown the accessions and additional declarations of the Contracting Parties. These lists, which shall be continually kept up to date, shall be published in the annual report presented to the General Assembly of the United Nations by the Secretary-General.   

### Article  44  

1.  The present General Act shall come into force on the ninetieth day following the receipt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the accession of not less than two Contracting Parties.   
2.  Accessions received after the entry into force of the Act, in accordance with the previous paragraph, shall become effective as from the ninetieth day following the date of receipt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The same rule shall apply to the additional declarations provided for by article 40.   

### Article  45  

1.  The present General Act shall be concluded for a period of five years, dating from its entry into force.   
2.  It shall remain in force for further successive periods of five years in the case of Contracting Parties which do not denounce it at least six months before the expiration of the current period.   
3.  Denunciation shall be effected by a written notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall inform all the Members of the United Nations and the non-member States referred to in article 43.   
4.  A denunciation may be partial only, or may consist in notification of reservations not previously made.   
5.  Notwithstanding denunciation by one of the Contracting Parties concerned in a dispute, all proceedings pending at the expiration of the current period of the General Act shall be duly completed.   

### Article  46

A certified true copy shall be delivered by the Secretary-General to each of the Members of the United Nations, to the non-member States which shall have become parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice and to those designated by the General Assembly of the United Nations.  

### Article  47  

The present General Act shall be registered by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the date of its entry into force.

### Artikel  11  

1.  Tenzij de partijen anders overeenkomen, zal de Verzoeningscommissie zelf haar procedure regelen, welke in ieder geval contradictoir zal moeten zijn. Voorzover enquêtes betreft, zal de Commissie, indien zij niet eenstemmig anders beslist, zich gedragen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Titel III van het Haagse Verdrag van 18 oktober 1907 voor de vreedzame beslechting van internationale geschillen.   
2.  De partijen zullen bij de Verzoeningscommissie vertegenwoordigd worden door agenten, die de opdracht hebben als tussenpersoon te dienen tussen de partijen en de Commissie; de partijen zullen zich bovendien kunnen doen bijstaan door raadslieden en deskundigen, die door haar te dien einde worden benoemd en zullen kunnen vragen, dat alle personen, wier getuigenis haar nuttig toeschijnt, worden gehoord.   
3.  De Commissie zal van haar kant de bevoegdheid hebben, mondelinge toelichtingen te vragen aan de agenten, raadslieden en deskundigen van de twee partijen, evenals aan alle personen, welke zij nuttig zou oordelen met toestemming van hun Regering te doen verschiinen.   

### Artikel  12  

Tenzij de partijen anders overeenkomen, zullen de beslissingen van de Verzoeningscommissie genomen worden met meerderheid van stemmen en de Commissie zal zich alleen kunnen uitspreken over het eigenlijke geschil zelf, indien alle leden aanwezig zijn.  

### Artikel  13  

De partijen verbinden zich de werkzaamheden van de Verzoeningscommissie te vergemakkelijken en in het bijzonder om haar in zo groot mogelijke mate alle stukken en inlichtingen, die haar van dienst kunnen zijn, te verschaffen, alsmede om gebruik te maken van de middelen waarover zij beschikken om het aan de Commissie mogelijk te maken op het grondgebied der Regeringen en overeenkomstig haar wetgeving over te gaan tot het oproepen en verhoren van getuigen of deskundigen en tot het onderzoek ter plaatse.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Gedurende de duur van de werkzaamheden van de Commissie zal ieder van de commissarissen een vergoeding ontvangen, waarvan het bedrag in gemeen overleg zal worden vastgesteld tussen de partijen, die ieder een gelijk deel er van zullen dragen.   
2.  De algemene kosten, die veroorzaakt worden door de werkzaamheden van de Commissie, zullen op dezelfde wijze verdeeld worden.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  De Verzoeningscommissie zal tot taak hebben de betwiste punten op te helderen, te dien einde alle nodige inlichtingen door middel van enquête of op andere wijze te verzamelen en te trachten de partijen te verzoenen. Zij zal, na onderzoek van de zaak, aan de partijen de voorwaarden van de regeling kunnen mededelen, die haar billijk zou voorkomen, en aan de partijen een termijn aanwijzen, waarbinnen zij zich hebben uit te spreken.   
2.  Aan het einde van haar werkzaamheden zal de Commissie een proces-verbaal opstellen, waarbij, al naar het geval is, zal worden vastgesteld, of dat de partijen tot een schikking zijn gekomen en, indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat, de voorwaarden van de schikking, of dat de partijen niet verzoend zijn kunnen worden. Het procesverbaal zal niet vermelden, of de beslissingen van de Commissie met eenstemmigheid of meerderheid zijn genomen.   
3.  De werkzaamheden van de Commissie zullen, tenzij de partijen anders overeenkomen, beëindigd moeten worden binnen een termijn van zes maanden, te rekenen van de dag, waarop het geschil voor de Commissie zal zijn gebracht.   

### Artikel  16  

Het proces-verbaal van de Commissie zal onverwijld ter kennis van de partijen worden gebracht. De partijen zullen beslissen, of het zal worden openbaar gemaakt.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

#### *Rechterlijke regeling* 

### Artikel  17  

Alle geschillen, ten aanzien waarvan de partijen elkander een recht zouden betwisten, zullen, behoudens eventuele voorbehouden, bedoeld in artikel 39, ter beoordeling aan het Internationale Gerechtshof worden voorgelegd, tenzij de partijen overeenkomen, op de wijze als hieronder voorzien, een beroep te doen op een scheidsgerecht. Het is wel verstaan, dat de hierboven bedoelde geschillen met name omvatten die geschillen, welke artikel 36 van het Statuut van het Internationale Gerechtshof vermeldt.  

### Artikel  18  

Indien de partijen het er over eens zijn, dat de in het voorafgaande artikel bedoelde geschillen zullen worden onderworpen aan een scheidsgerecht, zullen zij een compromis opstellen, waarin zij zullen aangeven het onderwerp van het geschil, de keuze van de scheidsrechters en de te volgen procedure. Bij gebreke van voldoende aanwijzingen of bijzonderheden in het compromis zullen voorzover nodig de bepalingen van het Haagse Verdrag van 18 oktober 1907 voor de vreedzame beslechting van internationale geschillen worden toegepast. Indien het compromis niets bevat omtrent de grondregelen, welke door de scheidsrechters zullen moeten worden toegepast, zal het scheidsgerecht de in artikel 38 van het Statuut van het Permanente Hof van Internationale Justitie vermelde grondregelen toepassen.  

### Artikel  19  

Bij gebreke van overeenstemming tussen de partijen nopens het in het vorige artikel bedoelde compromis of bij gebreke van aanwijzing van scheidsrechters, zal ieder van beide partijen, drie maanden na van haar besluit te hebben kennisgegeven, het recht hebben het geschil rechtstreeks bij rekest voor het Internationale Gerechtshof te brengen.  

### Artikel  20  

1.  In afwijking van artikel 1 zullen de in artikel 17 bedoelde geschillen, die ontstaan tussen partijen, welke zijn toegetreden tot de in dit hoofdstuk vervatte verbintenissen, alleen bij onderlinge overeenstemming aan de verzoeningsprocedure worden onderworpen.   
2.  De verplichte verzoeningsprocedure blijft van toepassing op de geschillen, die door de werking van de voorbehouden bedoeld in artikel 39 van de rechterlijke regeling zijn uitgesloten.   
3.  In geval van beroep op de verzoeningsprocedure en van het mislukken daarvan zal geen van de partijen het geschil voor het Internationale Gerechtshof mogen brengen of de instelling van het in artikel 18 bedoelde scheidsgerecht mogen vragen, vóórdat een maand zal zijn verlopen na de beëindiging van de werkzaamheden van de Verzoeningscommissie.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

#### *De scheidsrechterlijke regeling* 

### Artikel  21  

Alle andere geschillen dan die welke bedoeld zijn in artikel 17, ten aanzien waarvan binnen een maand na de beëindiging van de werkzaamheden van de in Hoofdstuk I bedoelde Verzoeningscommissie de partijen niet tot overeenstemming mochten zijn gekomen, zullen behoudens eventuele voorbehouden bedoeld in artikel 39, gebracht worden voor een scheidsgerecht, dat, tenzij de partijen anders overeenkomen, zal worden samengesteld op de wijze als hieronder is aangegeven.  

### Artikel  22  

Het scheidsgerecht zal bestaan uit vijf leden. De partijen zullen ieder één hiervan benoemen, die gekozen zal kunnen worden uit haar respectieve onderdanen. De beide andere scheidsrechters en de opperscheidsrechter zullen in gemeen overleg worden gekozen uit de onderdanen van derde Mogendheden. Deze laatsten zullen van verschillende nationaliteit moeten zijn, zullen niet hun gewoon verblijf moeten hebben op het grondgebied van de betrokken partijen en zich niet in dienst van deze partijen mogen bevinden.  

### Artikel  23  

1.  Indien de benoeming van de leden van het scheidsgerecht niet tot stand komt binnen een termijn van drie maanden te rekenen van de datum, waarop de éne partij tot de andere het verzoek heeft gericht een scheidsgerecht samen te stellen, zal aan een derde Mogendheid, die in gemeen overleg door de partijen zal worden gekozen, worden verzocht tot de nodige benoemingen over te gaan.   
2.  Indien ten aanzien hiervan geen overeenstemming wordt bereikt, zal iedere partij een verschillende Mogendheid aanwijzen en de benoemingen zullen geschieden in gemeen overleg tussen de aldus gekozen Mogendheden.   
3.  Indien binnen een termijn van drie maanden de twee aldus aangewezen Mogendheden niet tot overeenstemming hebben kunnen komen, zullen de nodige benoemingen worden gedaan door de Voorzitter van het Internationale Gerechtshof. Indien deze verhinderd is, of indien hij onderdaan is van een der partijen, zullen de benoemingen worden gedaan door de ondervoorzitter. Indien deze verhinderd is, of indien deze onderdaan is van een der partijen, zullen de benoemingen worden gedaan door het lid van het Hof dat het oudste is in jaren en dat niet onderdaan is van een van de partijen.   

### Artikel  24  

Er zal binnen een zo kort mogelijke termijn voorzien worden in vacatures, die zich tengevolge van overlijden of ontslag of welke andere oorzaak ook mochten voordoen, op de wijze vastgesteld voor de benoeming.  

### Artikel  25  

De partijen zullen een compromis opstellen, dat het onderwerp van het geschil en de te volgen procedure zal omschrijven.  

### Artikel  26  

Bij gebreke van voldoende aanwijzingen of bijzonderheden in het compromis zullen voorzover nodig de bepalingen van het Haagse Verdrag van 18 oktober 1907 voor de vreedzame beslechting van internationale geschillen worden toegepast.  

### Artikel  27  

Indien een compromis niet wordt gesloten binnen een termijn van drie maanden, te rekenen van de datum van de samenstelling van het scheidsgerecht, zal het geschil bij rekest door een van de partijen voor het scheidsgerecht kunnen worden gebracht.  

### Artikel  28  

Indien het compromis hierover niets bevat of indien het compromis niet tot stand is gekomen, zal het scheidsgerecht de in artikel 38 van het Statuut van het Internationale Gerechtshof vermelde grondregelen toepassen. Voorzover zodanige regelen, welke op het geschil zouden kunnen worden toegepast, niet bestaan, zal het scheidsgerecht oordelen *ex aequo et bono.*  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

#### *Algemene bepalingen* 

### Artikel  29  

1.  Geschillen, voor de oplossing waarvan een bijzondere procedure is voorzien in andere verdragen, welke van kracht zijn tussen de bij het geschil betrokken partijen, zullen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze verdragen worden geregeld.   
2.  Deze Algemene Akte maakt geen inbreuk op van kracht zijnde overeenkomsten, welke tussen de Partijen een verzoeningsprocedure instellen of inzake scheidsrechterlijke of rechterlijke regeling verbintenissen medebrengen, welke de oplossing van het geschil verzekeren. Indien echter zodanige overeenkomsten alleen een verzoeningsprocedure voorzien, zullen, nadat deze procedure zal zijn mislukt, de bepalingen van deze Algemene Akte met betrekking tot de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke regelingen toepassing vinden voorzover de betrokken partijen daartoe zullen zijn toegetreden.   

### Artikel  30  

Indien een van de partijen voor de Verzoeningscommissie een geschil brengt, dat de andere partij, zich beroepend op tussen de partijen van kracht zijnde verdragen, gebracht heeft voor het Internationale Gerechtshof of voor een scheidsgerecht, zal de Commissie het onderzoek van het geschil uitstellen, totdat het Hof of het scheidsgerecht over het competentiegeschil zal hebben beslist. Hetzelfde zal geschieden, indien een der partijen zich tot het Hof of het scheidsgerecht wendt gedurende de verzoeningsprocedure.  

### Artikel  31  

1.  In geval van een geschil, waarvan het onderwerp volgens de nationale wetgeving van een van de partijen behoort tot de bevoegdheid van de rechterlijke of administratieve autoriteiten, zal deze partij zich er tegen kunnen verzetten, dat dit geschil wordt onderworpen aan de verschillende in deze Algemene Akte voorziene procedures, voordat een definitieve beslissing binnen een redelijke termijn zal zijn gegeven door de bevoegde autoriteit.   
2.  De partij, die in zodanig geval zal willen overgaan tot de in deze Algemene Akte voorziene procedures, zal van haar voornemen aan de andere partij moeten kennisgeven binnen de termijn van één jaar, te rekenen van de datum van de bovenbedoelde beslissing.   

### Artikel  32  

Indien in een rechterlijk of scheidsrechterlijk vonnis wordt verklaard, dat een door een rechterlijke autoriteit of door een andere autoriteit van een der betrokken partijen genomen beslissing of gelaste maatregel geheel of gedeeltelijk in strijd is met het internationale recht en indien het grondwettelijke recht van genoemde partij niet of althans niet volledig zou toelaten, dat de gevolgen van deze beslissing of maatregel worden te niet gedaan, komen de partijen overeen, dat de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke beslissing aan de benadeelde partij een billijke genoegdoening zal verschaffen.  

### Artikel  33  

1.  In alle gevallen, waarin het geschil het onderwerp uitmaakt van een scheidsrechterlijke of rechterlijke procedure, en in het bijzonder indien de vraag ten aanzien waarvan de partijen verdeeld zijn, voortvloeit uit handelingen, welke reeds zijn verricht of op het punt zijn te worden verricht, zal het Internationale Gerechtshof, beslissende overeenkomstig artikel 41 van zijn Statuut, of het scheidsgerecht binnen de kortst mogelijke tijd aangeven, welke voorlopige maatregelen moeten worden genomen. De bij het geschil betrokken partijen zullen verplicht zijn zich dienovereenkomstig te gedragen.   
2.  Indien een geschil gebracht is voor een Verzoeningscommissie, zal deze aan de partijen de voorlopige maatregelen, welke zij nuttig oordeelt, kunnen aanbevelen.   
3.  De partijen verbinden zich zich te onthouden van iedere maatregel, die zou kunnen prejudiciëren op de uitvoering van de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke beslissing of op de door de Verzoeningscommissie voorgestelde regelingen en in het algemeen om niet over te gaan tot enige handeling, van welke aard ook, welke ten gevolge zou kunnen hebben het geschil te verscherpen of uit te breiden.   

### Artikel  34  

In geval tussen meer dan twee partijen, welke tot deze Algemene Akte zijn toegetreden, een geschil ontstaat, zullen de volgende regelen worden in acht genomen voor de toepassing van de in de voorafgaande bepalingen beschreven procedures: 

a) Voor de verzoeningsprocedure zal altijd een bijzondere commissie worden ingesteld. De samenstelling hiervan zal verschillend zijn naar gelang de partijen alle afzonderlijke belangen hebben of twee of meer van haar gemeenschappelijk optreden. In het eerste geval zullen de partijen ieder een commissaris benoemen en gemeenschappelijk commissarissen aanwijzen, welke onderdanen zijn van derde Mogendheden, die niet bij het geschil zijn betrokken, van welke het aantal altijd één meer zal bedragen dan dat van de door de partijen afzonderlijk benoemde commissarissen. In het tweede geval zullen de partijen, die gemeenschappelijk optreden, in onderling overleg gezamenlijk haar eigen commissaris benoemen en zullen zij met de andere partij of partijen samenwerken voor de aanwijzing van derde commissarissen. Zowel in het ene als in het andere geval zullen de partijen, tenzij zij anders overeenkomen, artikel 5 en volgende van deze Akte toepassen, voorzover deze verenigbaar zijn met de bepalingen van dit artikel.  

b) Voor de rechterlijke procedure zal het Statuut van het Internationale Gerechtshof worden toegepast.  

c) Voor de scheidsrechterlijke procedure zal bij gebreke van overeenstemming tussen de partijen nopens de samenstelling van het scheidsgerecht, in geval van geschillen welke bedoeld zijn in artikel 17, ieder van de partijen het recht hebben rechtstreeks bij rekest het geschil voor het Internationale Gerechtshof te brengen; in geval van geschillen welke bedoeld zijn in artikel 21, zullen artikel 22 en volgende worden toegepast, maar ieder van de partijen, die afzonderlijke belangen heeft, zal een scheidsrechter benoemen en het aantal van de afzonderlijk door de partijen benoemde scheidsrechters zal altijd één minder zijn dan dat van de andere scheidsrechters.    

### Artikel  35  

1.  Deze Algemene Akte zal van toepassing zijn tussen de Partijen die daartoe zijn toegetreden, ook wanneer een derde Mogendheid, al dan niet Partij bij de Akte, belang heeft bij het geschil.   
2.  Bij de verzoeningsprocedure zullen de partijen in gemeen overleg een derde Mogendheid kunnen uitnodigen.   

### Artikel  36  

1.  Bij de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke procedure zal een derde Mogendheid, indien deze van oordeel is, dat in een geschil voor haar een rechtsbelang betrokken is, aan het Internationale Gerechtshof of aan het scheidsgerecht een verzoek richten om te mogen tussenkomen.   
2.  Het Hof of het scheidsgerecht beslist hierover.   

### Artikel  37  

1.  Indien het betreft de uitlegging van een verdrag, waaraan andere Staten dan de partijen in het geschil betrokken hebben deelgenomen, stelt de Griffier van het Internationale Gerechtshof of het scheidsgerecht zonder verwijl deze Staten hiermede in kennis.   
2.  Ieder van zodanige Staten heeft het recht van tussenkomst en, indien hij van deze bevoegdheid gebruik maakt, is de in het vonnis gegeven uitlegging te zijnen opzichte bindend.   

### Artikel  38  

De toetredingen tot deze Algemene Akte zullen betrekking kunnen hebben: 

A. hetzij op de Akte in haar geheel (Hoofdstukken I, II, III en IV);  

B. hetzij alleen op de bepalingen betreffende de verzoening en de rechterlijke regeling (Hoofdstukken I en II), te zamen met de algemene bepalingen betreffende deze procedures (Hoofdstuk IV);  

C. hetzij alleen op de bepalingen betreffende de verzoening (Hoofdstuk I), te zamen met de algemene bepalingen betreffende deze procedure (Hoofdstuk IV).   De Verdragsluitende Partijen kunnen zich slechts op de toetreding van andere Partijen beroepen in zoverre zij zelf dezelfde verbintenissen hebben aanvaard.  

### Artikel  39  

1.  Naast de in het vorige artikel vermelde bevoegdheid zal een Partij bij haar toetreding tot deze Algemene Akte haar aanvaarding ondergeschikt kunnen maken aan de in het volgende lid limitatief opgenoemde voorbehouden. Deze voorbehouden moeten op het ogenblik van toetreding worden aangegeven.   
2.  Deze voorbehouden zullen van de in deze Akte omschreven procedures kunnen uitsluiten: 

a) Geschillen, welke hun ontstaan danken aan feiten, voorafgaande hetzij aan de toetreding van de Partij die het voorbehoud opstelt, hetzij aan de toetreding van een andere partij, waarmede de eerste een geschil mocht hebben;  

b) Geschillen, betrekking hebbende op vragen, die het internationale recht overlaat aan de uitsluitende bevoegdheid van Staten;  

c) Geschillen, betrekking hebbende op bijzondere gevallen of bijzondere precies omschreven onderwerpen, zoals het territoriaal statuut, of geschillen welke vallen in welomschreven categorieën.     
3.  Indien een van de partijen, die bij het geschil betrokken zijn, een voorbehoud heeft opgesteld, zullen de andere partijen zich ten aanzien van deze partij op hetzelfde voorbehoud kunnen beroepen.   
4.  Voor de Partijen, die zijn toegetreden tot de bepalingen van deze Algemene Akte, welke betrekking hebben op de rechterlijke of scheidsrechterlijke regeling, zullen de voorbehouden, welke zij mochten hebben gemaakt, behoudens uitdrukkelijke vermelding, geacht worden zich niet uit te strekken tot de verzoeningsprocedure.   

### Artikel  40  

Een Partij, die slechts tot een gedeelte of onder voorbehoud is toegetreden, zal op ieder ogenblik door middel van een eenvoudige verklaring, hetzij de draagwijdte van haar toetreding kunnen uitbreiden, hetzij afstand kunnen doen van alle of een gedeelte van haar voorbehouden.  

### Artikel  41  

Geschillen, welke betrekking hebben op de uitlegging of toepassing van deze Algemene Akte, met inbegrip van die betrekking hebbende op de qualificatie van de geschillen en de draagwijdte van voorbehouden, zullen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof worden onderworpen.
