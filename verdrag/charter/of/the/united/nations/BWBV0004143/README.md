####Handvest van de Verenigde Naties

Wij, de volken van de Verenigde Naties, vastbesloten komende geslachten te behoeden voor de gesel van de oorlog, die tweemaal in ons leven onnoemelijk leed over de mensheid heeft gebracht, en opnieuw ons vertrouwen te bevestigen in de fundamentele rechten van de mens, in de waardigheid en de waarde van de menselijke persoon, in gelijke rechten voor mannen en vrouwen, alsmede voor grote en kleine naties, en omstandigheden te scheppen waaronder gerechtigheid, alsmede eerbied voor de uit verdragen en andere bronnen van internationaal recht voortvloeiende verplichtingen kunnen worden gehandhaafd, en sociale vooruitgang en hogere levensstandaarden in groter vrijheid te bevorderen, en te dien einde verdraagzaamheid te betrachten en in vrede met elkander te leven als goede naburen, en onze krachten te bundelen ter handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid, en door het aanvaarden van beginselen en het invoeren van methodes te verzekeren, dat wapengeweld niet zal worden gebruikt behalve in het algemeen belang, en gebruik te maken van internationale instellingen voor de bevordering van de economische en sociale vooruitgang van alle volken, hebben besloten onze inspanningen te verenigen om deze doeleinden te verwezenlijken. Dienovereenkomstig hebben onze onderscheiden regeringen, door tussenkomst van hun in de stad San Francisco bijeengekomen vertegenwoordigers, die hun volmachten hebben overgelegd, welke in goede orde zijn bevonden, overeenstemming bereikt over dit Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en richten zij hierbij een internationale organisatie op, die de naam zal dragen van de Verenigde Naties.     
### Hoofdstuk  I  

####DOELSTELLINGEN EN BEGINSELEN

### Artikel  1  

De doelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties zijn: 

1. De internationale vrede en veiligheid te handhaven en, met het oog daarop: doeltreffende gezamenlijke maatregelen te nemen ter voorkoming en opheffing van bedreigingen van de vrede en ter onderdrukking van daden van agressie of andere vormen van verbreking van de vrede, alsook met vreedzame middelen en in overeenstemming met de beginselen van gerechtigheid en internationaal recht, een regeling of beslechting van internationale geschillen of van situaties die tot verbreking van de vrede zouden kunnen leiden, tot stand te brengen;  

2. Tussen de naties vriendschappelijke betrekkingen tot ontwikkeling te brengen, die zijn gegrond op eerbied voor het beginsel van gelijke rechten en van zelfbeschikking voor volken, en andere passende maatregelen te nemen ter versterking van de vrede overal ter wereld;  

3. Internationale samenwerking tot stand te brengen bij het oplossen van internationale vraagstukken van economische, sociale, culturele of humanitaire aard, alsmede bij het bevorderen en stimuleren van eerbied voor de rechten van de mens en voor fundamentele vrijheden voor allen, zonder onderscheid naar ras, geslacht, taal of godsdienst; en  

4. Een centrum te zijn voor de harmonisatie van het optreden van de naties ter verwezenlijking van deze gemeenschappelijke doelstellingen.    

### Artikel  2  

Bij het nastreven van de in artikel 1 genoemde doelstellingen, dienen de Organisatie en haar Leden te handelen overeenkomstig de volgende beginselen: 

1. De Organisatie is gegrond op het beginsel van soevereine gelijkheid van al haar Leden.  

2. Ten einde alle Leden de rechten en voordelen die uit het lidmaatschap voortvloeien deelachtig te doen worden, dienen de Leden van de Organisatie de verplichtingen die zij overeenkomstig dit Handvest op zich hebben genomen, te goeder trouw na te komen.  

3. Alle Leden brengen hun internationale geschillen langs vreedzame weg tot een oplossing, op zodanige wijze dat de internationale vrede en veiligheid en de gerechtigheid niet in gevaar worden gebracht.  

4. In hun internationale betrekkingen onthouden alle Leden zich van bedreiging met of het gebruik van geweld tegen de territoriale integriteit of de politieke onafhankelijkheid van een staat, en van elke andere handelwijze die onverenigbaar is met de doelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties.  

5. Alle Leden verlenen de Verenigde Naties volledige bijstand bij elk optreden waartoe de Organisatie overeenkomstig dit Handvest overgaat en zij onthouden zich van het verlenen van bijstand aan een staat waartegen de Verenigde Naties een preventieve of dwangactie ondernemen.  

6. De Organisatie draagt er zorg voor dat staten die geen Lid van de Verenigde Naties zijn overeenkomstig deze beginselen handelen, voor zover dit voor de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid noodzakelijk kan zijn.  

7. Geen enkele bepaling van dit Handvest geeft de Verenigde Naties de bevoegdheid tussenbeide te komen in aangelegenheden die wezenlijk onder de nationale rechtsmacht van een staat vallen, noch wordt op grond van enige bepaling daarin van de Leden verlangd dat zij zodanige aangelegenheden krachtens dit Handvest tot een oplossing brengen. Dit beginsel staat de toepassing van dwangmaatregelen ingevolge Hoofdstuk VII evenwel niet in de weg.

De uitoefening van die rechten en voorrechten kan door de Veiligheidsraad worden hersteld.  

### Artikel  6  

Een Lid van de Verenigde Naties dat bij voortduring de in dit Handvest vervatte beginselen heeft geschonden, kan, op aanbeveling van de Veiligheidsraad, door de Algemene Vergadering worden uitgestoten als Lid van de Organisatie.

Niettemin kan de Algemene Vergadering zulk een Lid toestaan zijn stem uit te brengen, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het uitblijven van de betaling te wijten is aan omstandigheden buiten de macht van het Lid.

De Republiek China, Frankrijk, de Unie van Socialistische Sovjetrepublieken, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika zijn permanente leden van de Veiligheidsraad. De Algemene Vergadering kiest tien andere Leden van de Verenigde Naties als niet-permanente leden van de Veiligheidsraad, waarbij in het bijzonder rekening wordt gehouden in de eerste plaats met de bijdrage van Leden van de Verenigde Naties tot de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid en tot de andere doelstellingen van de Organisatie, en tevens met een billijke geografische spreiding.   
2.  De niet-permanente leden van de Veiligheidsraad worden gekozen voor een termijn van twee jaar. Nadat het aantal leden van de Veiligheidsraad van elf tot vijftien is uitgebreid worden bij de eerstvolgende verkiezing van de niet-permanente leden twee van de vier toegevoegde leden gekozen voor een termijn van een jaar. Een aftredend lid kan niet onmiddellijk worden herkozen.

1.  Ten einde een snel en doeltreffend optreden van de Verenigde Naties te verzekeren, dragen de Leden de verantwoordelijkheid voor de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid in de eerste plaats op aan de Veiligheidsraad, en stemmen zij er in toe dat de Veiligheidsraad, bij de uitvoering van de uit die verantwoordelijkheid voortvloeiende taken, in hun naam handelt.   
2.  Bij de uitvoering van deze taken handelt de Veiligheidsraad overeenkomstig de doelstellingen en beginselen van de Verenigde Naties. De bijzondere bevoegdheden die de Veiligheidsraad voor de uitvoering van deze taken worden verleend, zijn omschreven in de Hoofdstukken VI, VII, VIII en XII.

### Artikel  26  

Ten einde de totstandkoming en de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid te bevorderen op een wijze waarbij een zo gering mogelijk deel van wat de wereld aan mensen en middelen te bieden heeft wordt uitgetrokken voor bewapening, heeft de Veiligheidsraad de verantwoordelijkheid om, met de hulp van het in artikel 47 genoemde Generale Staf-Comité, plannen op te stellen die worden voorgelegd aan de Leden van de Verenigde Naties om te komen tot een stelsel van wapenbeheersing.

2.  De Veiligheidsraad houdt regelmatig zittingen, waarop elk van de leden, zo het zulks verlangt, kan worden vertegenwoordigd door een lid van de regering of door een andere in het bijzonder daartoe aangewezen vertegenwoordiger.   
3.  De Veiligheidsraad kan, zo hij van oordeel is dat zijn taak daardoor wordt vergemakkelijkt, vergaderingen houden in andere plaatsen dan die waar de zetel van de Organisatie is gevestigd.

De Veiligheidsraad stelt de voorwaarden vast die hij juist acht voor het deelnemen van een staat die geen Lid is van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Hoofdstuk  VI  

####VREEDZAME REGELING VAN GESCHILLEN

### Artikel  33  

1.  De partijen bij een geschil waarvan het voortbestaan de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid in gevaar dreigt te brengen, dienen daarvoor allereerst een oplossing te zoeken door onderhandelingen, feitenonderzoek, bemiddeling, conciliatie, arbitrage, een rechterlijke beslissing, het doen van een beroep op regionale organen of akkoorden, of andere vreedzame middelen naar hun eigen keuze.   
2.  Zo hij zulks nodig acht, doet de Veiligheidsraad een beroep op de partijen hun geschil langs deze wegen te regelen.   

### Artikel  34  

De Veiligheidsraad kan elk geschil onderzoeken alsmede elke situatie die tot internationale wrijving kan leiden of de aanleiding kan vormen tot een geschil, ten einde vast te stellen of het voortduren van het geschil of van de situatie de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid in gevaar dreigt te brengen.  

### Artikel  35  

1.  Elk Lid van de Verenigde Naties kan elk geschil of elke situatie zoals bedoeld in artikel 34 onder de aandacht brengen van de Veiligheidsraad of van de Algemene Vergadering.   
2.  Een staat die geen Lid is van de Verenigde Naties kan elk geschil waarbij hij partij is onder de aandacht brengen van de Veiligheidsraad of van de Algemene Vergadering, indien hij vooraf ten aanzien van dat geschil de verplichtingen voor een vreedzame regeling zoals in dit Handvest voorzien, aanvaardt.   
3.  Het optreden van de Algemene Vergadering met betrekking tot zaken die krachtens dit artikel onder haar aandacht worden gebracht, is onderworpen aan de bepalingen van de artikelen 11 en 12.

3.  Bij het doen van aanbevelingen ingevolge dit artikel dient de Veiligheidsraad er eveneens rekening mee te houden dat als algemene regel rechtsgeschillen door de partijen dienen te worden voorgelegd aan het Internationaal Gerechtshof, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het Statuut van het Hof.   

### Artikel  37

2.  Indien de Veiligheidsraad van oordeel is dat het voortbestaan van het geschil de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid inderdaad in gevaar dreigt te brengen, besluit hij of hij zal handelen overeenkomstig artikel 36, dan wel dat hij een zodanige regeling zal aanbevelen als hij passend acht.   

### Artikel  38

### Hoofdstuk  VII  

####OPTREDEN MET BETREKKING TOT BEDREIGING VAN DE VREDE, VERBREKING VAN DE VREDE EN DADEN VAN AGRESSIE

### Artikel  39  

De Veiligheidsraad stelt vast of er sprake is van een bedreiging van de vrede, verbreking van de vrede of daad van agressie, en doet aanbevelingen, of beslist welke maatregelen zullen worden genomen overeenkomstig de artikelen 41 en 42 tot handhaving of herstel van de internationale vrede en veiligheid.  

### Artikel  40  

Om te voorkomen dat de situatie verergert, kan de Veiligheidsraad, alvorens de aanbevelingen te doen ofte besluiten tot het nemen van maatregelen als bedoeld in artikel 39, een beroep doen op de betrokken partijen zich te houden aan de voorlopige maatregelen die de Raad noodzakelijk of gewenst acht. Deze voorlopige maatregelen laten de rechten, aanspraken, of de positie van de betrokken partijen onverlet. Indien deze voorlopige maatregelen niet worden nageleefd, houdt de Veiligheidsraad daarmee terdege rekening.  

### Artikel  41  

De Veiligheidsraad kan besluiten welke maatregelen waaraan geen wapengeweld te pas komt, dienen te worden genomen om zijn besluiten ten uitvoer te brengen en kan de Leden van de Verenigde Naties oproepen om deze maatregelen toe te passen. Deze kunnen omvatten het volledig of gedeeltelijk verbreken van de economische betrekkingen, alsmede van de spoor-, zee-, lucht-, post-, telegraaf- en radioverbindingen en van andere verbindingen, en het afbreken van diplomatieke betrekkingen.  

### Artikel  42  

Mocht de Veiligheidsraad van oordeel zijn dat de in artikel 41 bedoelde maatregelen onvoldoende zouden zijn of dat zij onvoldoende zijn gebleken, dan kan hij overgaan tot zulk optreden door middel van lucht-, zee- of landstrijdkrachten als nodig is voor de handhaving of het herstel van de internationale vrede en veiligheid. Zulk optreden kan omvatten demonstraties, blokkades en andere operaties door lucht-, zee- of landstrijdkrachten van Leden van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  43  

1.  Ten einde bij te dragen tot de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid nemen alle Leden van de Verenigde Naties de verplichting op zich aan de Veiligheidsraad, op diens oproep en krachtens een of meerdere bijzondere overeenkomsten, zodanige gewapende strijdkrachten ter beschikking te stellen en zodanige bijstand en faciliteiten, waaronder het recht van doortocht, te verlenen als noodzakelijk zijn voor de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid.   
2.  In een dergelijke overeenkomst of overeenkomsten worden de getalsterkte en de aard van de strijdkrachten, hun graad van paraatheid en hun algemene legering, alsmede de aard van de te verlenen faciliteiten en bijstand, geregeld.   
3.  Over de overeenkomst of overeenkomsten wordt zo spoedig mogelijk onderhandeld op initiatief van de Veiligheidsraad. Zij worden gesloten tussen de Veiligheidsraad en Leden of tussen de Veiligheidsraad en groepen Leden en zijn onderworpen aan bekrachtiging door de staten die ze ondertekend hebben, overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden grondwettelijke procedures.   

### Artikel  44  

Wanneer de Veiligheidsraad heeft besloten geweld te gebruiken, nodigt hij, alvorens een Lid dat niet in de Raad is vertegenwoordigd op te roepen strijdkrachten ter beschikking te stellen ter voldoening aan de ingevolge artikel 43 aanvaarde verplichtingen, dat Lid uit om, zo het de wens daartoe te kennen geeft, deel te nemen aan de besluitvorming van de Veiligheidsraad betreffende het gebruik van contingenten van de strijdkrachten van dat Lid.  

### Artikel  45  

Ten einde de Verenigde Naties in staat te stellen dringend geboden militaire maatregelen te nemen, houden de Leden nationale luchtmachtcontingenten voor onmiddellijke inzet beschikbaar met het oog op een gezamenlijke internationale dwangactie. De sterkte en graad van paraatheid van deze contingenten, alsmede de plannen voor hun gezamenlijk optreden worden, binnen de grenzen genoemd in de in artikel 43 bedoelde bijzondere overeenkomst of overeenkomsten, vastgesteld door de Veiligheidsraad, met de hulp van het Generale Staf-Comité.  

### Artikel  46  

Plannen voor het gebruik van gewapend geweld worden door de Veiligheidsraad, met de hulp van het Generale Staf-Comité, opgesteld.  

### Artikel  47  

1.  Er wordt een Generale Staf-Comité ingesteld om de Veiligheidsraad advies en bijstand te verlenen inzake alle aangelegenheden die verband houden met de militaire behoeften van de Veiligheidsraad ter handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid, het inzetten van en de bevelvoering over de aan de Raad ter beschikking gestelde strijdkrachten, de wapenbeheersing en eventuele ontwapening.   
2.  Het Generale Staf-Comité bestaat uit de Stafchefs van de permanente leden van de Veiligheidsraad of hun vertegenwoordigers. Elk Lid van de Verenigde Naties dat niet permanent in het Comité is vertegenwoordigd, wordt door het Comité uitgenodigd zich daarin te doen vertegenwoordigen, wanneer de doelmatige uitvoering van de taak van het Comité het noodzakelijk maakt dat dat Lid aan de werkzaamheden van het Comité deelneemt.   
3.  Het Generale Staf-Comité is, onder toezicht van de Veiligheidsraad, verantwoordelijk voor de strategische leiding van de aan de Veiligheidsraad ter beschikking gestelde strijdkrachten. Vraagstukken die met de bevelvoering over deze strijdkrachten verband houden, worden later uitgewerkt.   
4.  Het Generale Staf-Comité kan, met machtiging van de Veiligheidsraad en na overleg met de daarvoor in aanmerking komende regionale organen, regionale sub-comité's instellen.   

### Artikel  48  

1.  Het optreden dat nodig is ter uitvoering van de besluiten van de Veiligheidsraad voor de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid geschiedt door alle Leden van de Verenigde Naties of door sommige daarvan, al naar gelang de Veiligheidsraad bepaalt.   
2.  Die besluiten worden door de Leden van de Verenigde Naties rechtstreeks uitgevoerd of door middel van hun optreden in de daarvoor in aanmerking komende internationale instellingen waarvan zij lid zijn.   

### Artikel  49  

De Leden van de Verenigde Naties werken samen ten einde elkaar wederzijds bijstand te verlenen bij het uitvoeren van de maatregelen waartoe de Veiligheidsraad heeft besloten.  

### Artikel  50  

Indien door de Veiligheidsraad tegen een staat preventieve maatregelen of dwangmaatregelen worden genomen, heeft elke andere staat, onverschillig of deze al dan niet Lid is van de Verenigde Naties, die zich gesteld ziet voor bijzondere economische problemen, voortvloeiend uit de tenuitvoerlegging van die maatregelen, het recht de Veiligheidsraad te raadplegen ten einde tot een oplossing van deze vraagstukken te komen.  

### Artikel  51  

Geen enkele bepaling van dit Handvest doet afbreuk aan het inherente recht tot individuele of collectieve zelfverdediging in geval van een gewapende aanval tegen een Lid van de Verenigde Naties, totdat de Veiligheidsraad de noodzakelijke maatregelen ter handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid heeft genomen. Maatregelen die door Leden zijn genomen bij de uitoefening van dit recht tot zelfverdediging dienen onverwijld ter kennis van de Veiligheidsraad te worden gebracht en tasten op geen enkele wijze de bevoegdheid en de verantwoordelijkheid van de Veiligheidsraad ingevolge dit Handvest aan om op enigerlei tijdstip over te gaan tot zulk optreden als hij nodig acht voor de handhaving of het herstel van de internationale vrede en veiligheid.  

### Hoofdstuk  VIII  

####REGIONALE AKKOORDEN

### Artikel  52  

1.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Handvest sluit het bestaan uit van regionale akkoorden of organen voor het behandelen van die aangelegenheden die de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid betreffen en welke in aanmerking komen voor optreden in regionaal verband, mits die akkoorden of organen en hun activiteiten verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen en beginselen van de Verenigde Naties.   
2.  De Leden van de Verenigde Naties die zulke akkoorden sluiten of zulke instellingen oprichten, laten, voordat zij lokale geschillen aan de Veiligheidsraad voorleggen, niets onbeproefd om deze op vreedzame wijze op te lossen in het kader van die regionale akkoorden of instellingen.   
3.  De Veiligheidsraad bevordert de ontwikkeling van een vreedzame regeling van lokale geschillen in het kader van regionale akkoorden of instellingen, hetzij op initiatief van de betrokken staten, hetzij ingevolge verwijzing door de Veiligheidsraad.   
4.  Dit artikel doet in generlei opzicht afbreuk aan de toepassing van de artikelen 34 en 35.   

### Artikel  53  

1.  Indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat, maakt de Veiligheidsraad van zulke regionale akkoorden of instellingen gebruik voor de uitvoering van op zijn gezag ondernomen dwangacties. Evenwel worden er geen dwangacties ingevolge regionale akkoorden of door regionale instellingen ondernomen zonder machtiging van de Veiligheidsraad, behoudens wanneer het maatregelen betreft tegen een vijandelijke staat zoals omschreven in het tweede lid van dit artikel, welke zijn voorzien in artikel 107 of in regionale akkoorden gericht tegen hervatting van een beleid van agressie van de kant van zulk een staat, totdat de Organisatie, op verzoek van de desbetreffende regeringen, zou worden belast met de verantwoordelijkheid voor het voorkomen van verdere agressie van de kant van zulk een staat.   
2.  De term „vijandelijke staat” zoals gebruikt in het eerste lid van dit artikel is van toepassing op elke staat die tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog een vijand is geweest van een staat die dit Handvest heeft ondertekend.   

### Artikel  54  

De Veiligheidsraad wordt te allen tijde volledig op de hoogte gehouden van alle activiteiten die krachtens regionale akkoorden of door regionale instellingen zijn ondernomen of worden overwogen ter handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid.

### Artikel  84  

Het behoort tot de taak van de bestuursautoriteit erop toe te zien dat het trustgebied zijn bijdrage levert tot de handhaving van de internationale vrede en veiligheid. Daartoe kan de bestuursautoriteit gebruik maken van vrijwillige strijdkrachten, faciliteiten en bijstand van het trustgebied, zowel voor het nakomen van de verplichtingen tegenover de Veiligheidsraad die de bestuursautoriteit in dit verband op zich heeft genomen, als voor de plaatselijke verdediging en de handhaving van orde en rust in het trustgebied.  

### Artikel  85
