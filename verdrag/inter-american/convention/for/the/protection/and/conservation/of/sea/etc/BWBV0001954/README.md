### Bijlage  III  

####Het gebruik van turtle excluder devices

1. Onder „garnalentrawler" wordt verstaan een vaartuig dat wordt gebruikt voor de vangst van garnalensoorten met behulp van sleepnetten.  

2. Onder „turtle excluder device" of „TED" wordt verstaan een voorziening die is ontworpen om de selectiviteit van de garnalensleepnetten te verhogen teneinde de incidentele vangst van zeeschildpadden tijdens garnalenvangsten te verminderen.  

3. Elke Partij verplicht de garnalentrawlers onder haar jurisdictie die werkzaam zijn binnen het Verdragsgebied de aanbevolen TED's, die naar behoren geïnstalleerd en doelmatig zijn, te gebruiken.  

4. Overeenkomstig de beste wetenschappelijke gegevens die beschikbaar zijn kan elke Partij slechts uitzonderingen toestaan op het in lid 3 verplicht gestelde gebruik van de TED's onder de volgende voorwaarden: 

a. voor garnalentrawlers waarvan de netten niet mechanisch maar uitsluitend handmatig worden binnengehaald, en garnalenboten met sleepnetten waarvoor geen SUV's zijn ontwikkeld. Een Partij die een dergelijke uitzondering toestaat neemt ter vermindering van de incidentele sterfte van zeeschildpadden andere, even doeltreffende maatregelen aan, zoals gelimiteerde sleeptijden, gesloten seizoenen en gesloten visgronden waar zeeschildpadden voorkomen, die de inspanningen ter verwezenlijking van de doelstelling van dit Verdrag niet frustreren;  

b. voor garnalentrawlers: 

i. die uitsluitend gebruik maken van ander sleeptuig waarvan is aangetoond dat het geen gevaar van incidentele zeeschildpadden-sterfte oplevert; of  

ii. die werken onder omstandigheden waarbij geen kans is op interactie met zeeschildpadden;   met dien verstande dat de Partij die een dergelijke uitzondering toestaat de andere Partijen, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via het secretariaat, indien opgericht, gedocumenteerd wetenschappelijk bewijs verschaft van het ontbreken van dit gevaar of deze kans;  

c. voor garnalentrawlers die wetenschappelijk onderzoek uitvoeren in een door de Partij goedgekeurd programma;  

d. indien de aanwezigheid van algen, zeewier, wrakstukken, of andere bijzondere omstandigheden, hetzij tijdelijk, hetzij voortdurend, het gebruik van SUV's in een bepaald gebied onmogelijk maken, met dien verstande dat: 

i. een Partij die deze uitzondering toestaat andere maatregelen aanneemt ter bescherming van zeeschildpadden in het gebied, zoals gelimiteerde sleeptijden;  

ii. een Partij slechts in uitzonderlijke noodsituaties van tijdelijke aard kan toestaan dat deze uitzondering van toepassing is op meer dan een klein aantal schepen onder haar jurisdictie die anders verplicht zijn worden om TED's te gebruiken ingevolge deze Bijlage;  

iii. een Partij die deze uitzondering toestaat aan de andere Partijen, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via het secretariaat, indien opgericht, gegevens verschaft met betrekking tot de bijzondere omstandigheden en het aantal garnalentrawlers dat werkzaam is in het betreffende gebied.      

5. Elke Partij kan commentaar leveren op de gegevens die door een andere Partij ingevolge het vierde lid ter beschikking zijn gesteld. Indien gepast, vragen de Partijen raad aan het raadgevend comité en het wetenschappelijk comité teneinde verschillen van mening op te lossen. Indien het raadgevend comité dit aanbeveelt en de Partijen akkoord gaan, neemt de Partij die de uitzondering heeft toegestaan ingevolge het vierde lid het toestaan of de omvang van een dergelijke uitzondering in heroverweging.  

6. De Partijen kunnen andere uitzonderingen op het in het derde lid verplicht gestelde gebruik van TED's goedkeuren bij consensus, overeenkomstig de beste wetenschappelijke gegevens die beschikbaar zijn en aan de hand van aanbevelingen van het raadgevend comité en het wetenschappelijk comité, teneinde rekening te houden met omstandigheden die bijzondere aandacht rechtvaardigen, met dien verstande dat dergelijke uitzonderingen de inspanningen ter verwezenlijking van de doelstelling van dit Verdrag niet belemmeren.  

7. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: 

a. zijn aanbevolen TED's die TED's die worden vastgesteld door de Partijen, met advies van het raadgevend comité, ter vermindering, tot het uiterst uitvoerbare, van de incidentele vangst van zeeschildpadden tijdens visvangstactiviteiten van garnalentrawlers;  

b. ontwikkelen de Partijen tijdens haar eerste vergadering een eerste lijst met aanbevolen TED's die zij in latere vergaderingen kunnen bijstellen;  

c. stelt elke Partij overeenkomstig haar wetten en regelingen tot aan de eerste vergadering van de Partijen de TED's vast die moeten worden gebruikt door garnalentrawlers onder haar jurisdictie, ter vermindering, tot het uiterst uitvoerbare, van de incidentele vangst van zeeschildpadden tijdens visvangstactiviteiten van garnalentrawlers, aan de hand van overleg met andere Partijen.    

8. Op verzoek van een andere Partij, het raadgevend comité of het wetenschappelijk comité, verschaft elke Partij, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via het secretariaat, indien opgericht, wetenschappelijke gegevens met betrekking tot de verwezenlijking van de doelstelling van dit Verdrag.
