##Verdrag van Stockholm inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen

####Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 

The Parties to this Convention, Recognizing that persistent organic pollutants possess toxic properties, resist degradation, bioaccumulate and are transported, through air, water and migratory species, across international boundaries and deposited far from their place of release, where they accumulate in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, Aware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from local exposure to persistent organic pollutants, in particular impacts upon women and, through them, upon future generations, Acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities are particularly at risk because of the biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants and that contamination of their traditional foods is a public health issue, Conscious of the need for global action on persistent organic pollutants, Mindful of decision 19/13 C of 7 February 1997 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme to initiate international action to protect human health and the environment through measures which will reduce and/or eliminate emissions and discharges of persistent organic pollutants, Recalling the pertinent provisions of the relevant international environmental conventions, especially the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal including the regional agreements developed within the framework of its Article 11, Recalling also the pertinent provisions of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21, Acknowledging that precaution underlies the concerns of all the Parties and is embedded within this Convention,  Recognizing that this Convention and other international agreements in the field of trade and the environment are mutually supportive, Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, Taking into account the circumstances and particular requirements of developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, and countries with economies in transition, especially the need to strengthen their national capabilities for the management of chemicals, including through the transfer of technology, the provision of financial and technical assistance and the promotion of cooperation among the Parties, Taking full account of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, adopted in Barbados on 6 May 1994, Noting the respective capabilities of developed and developing countries, as well as the common but differentiated responsibilities of States as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Recognizing the important contribution that the private sector and non-governmental organizations can make to achieving the reduction and/or elimination of emissions and discharges of persistent organic pollutants, Underlining the importance of manufacturers of persistent organic pollutants taking responsibility for reducing adverse effects caused by their products and for providing information to users, Governments and the public on the hazardous properties of those chemicals, Conscious of the need to take measures to prevent adverse effects caused by persistent organic pollutants at all stages of their life cycle, Reaffirming Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development which states that national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and without distorting international trade and investment, Encouraging Parties not having regulatory and assessment schemes for pesticides and industrial chemicals to develop such schemes, Recognizing the importance of developing and using environmentally sound alternative processes and chemicals, Determined to protect human health and the environment from the harmful impacts of persistent organic pollutants, Have agreed as follows:

Notes: 

(i) Except as otherwise specified in this Convention, quantities of a chemical occurring as unintentional trace contaminants in products and articles shall not be considered to be listed in this Annex;  

(ii) This note shall not be considered as a production and use specific exemption for purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3. Quantities of a chemical occurring as constituents of articles manufactured or already in use before or on the date of entry into force of the relevant obligation with respect to that chemical, shall not be considered as listed in this Annex, provided that a Party has notified the Secretariat that a particular type of article remains in use within that Party. The Secretariat shall make such notifications publicly available;  

(iii) This note, which does not apply to a chemical that has an asterisk following its name in the Chemical column in Part I of this Annex, shall not be considered as a production and use specific exemption for purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3. Given that no significant quantities of the chemical are expected to reach humans and the environment during the production and use of a closed-system site-limited intermediate, a Party, upon notification to the Secretariat, may allow the production and use of quantities of a chemical listed in this Annex as a closed-system site-limited intermediate that is chemically transformed in the manufacture of other chemicals that, taking into consideration the criteria in paragraph 1 of Annex D, do not exhibit the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants. This notification shall include information on total production and use of such chemical or a reasonable estimate of such information and information regarding the nature of the closed-system site-limited process including the amount of any non-transformed and unintentional trace contamination of the persistent organic pollutant-starting material in the final product. This procedure applies except as otherwise specified in this Annex. The Secretariat shall make such notifications available to the Conference of the Parties and to the public. Such production or use shall not be considered a production or use specific exemption. Such production and use shall cease after a ten-year period, unless the Party concerned submits a new notification to the Secretariat, in which case the period will be extended for an additional ten years unless the Conference of the Parties, after a review of the production and use decides otherwise. The notification procedure can be repeated;  

(iv) All the specific exemptions in this Annex may be exercised by Parties that have registered exemptions in respect of them in accordance with Article 4 with the exception of the use of polychlorinated biphenyls in articles in use in accordance with the provisions of Part II, and the use of tetrabromodiphenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether in accordance with the provisions of Part IV<sup>[Red: Redactie Tractatenblad: kennelijk wordt hier „Part V” bedoeld.]</sup> of this Annex, and the use of hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of this Annex, which may be exercised by all Parties;  

(v)Technical endosulfan (CAS No: 115-29-7), its related isomers (CAS No: 959-98-8 and CAS No: 33213-65-9) and endosulfan sulfate (CAS No: 1031-07-8) were assessed and identified as persistent organic pollutants.

For the purposes of this Annex:

a) ``Polychlorinated biphenyls" means aromatic compounds formed in such a manner that the hydrogen atoms on the biphenyl molecule (two benzene rings bonded together by a single carbon-carbon bond) may be replaced by up to ten chlorine atoms; and  

b) ``Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins" and ``polychlorinated dibenzofurans" are tricyclic, aromatic compounds formed by two benzene rings connected by two oxygen atoms in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and by one oxygen atom and one carbon-carbon bond in polychlorinated dibenzofurans and the hydrogen atoms of which may be replaced by up to eight chlorine atoms.  

###2 

In this Annex, the toxicity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans is expressed using the concept of toxic equivalency which measures the relative dioxin-like toxic activity of different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in comparison to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The toxic equivalent factor values to be used for the purposes of this Convention shall be consistent with accepted international standards, commencing with the World Health Organization 1998 mammalian toxic equivalent factor values for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations are expressed in toxic equivalents.

### Part  V 

####General guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices 

This Part provides general guidance to Parties on preventing or reducing releases of the chemicals listed in Part I.
###A. General prevention measures relating to both best available techniques and best environmental practices

Priority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and release of the chemicals listed in Part I. Useful measures could include:

a) The use of low-waste technology;  

b) The use of less hazardous substances;  

c) The promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances generated and used in a process;  

d) Replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from the source;  

e) Good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes;  

f) Improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites. When considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities to minimize the generation of municipal and medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products that generate less waste. Under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully considered;  

g) Minimization of these chemicals as contaminants in products;  

h) Avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching.  
###B. Best available techniques

The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions. Appropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in Part I are in general the same. In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention: 

a) General considerations: 

(i) The nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned: techniques may vary depending on source size;  

(ii) The commissioning dates for new or existing installations;  

(iii) The time needed to introduce the best available technique;  

(iv) The consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its energy efficiency;  

(v) The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the releases to the environment and the risks to it;  

(vi) The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment;  

(vii) The need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces;  

(viii) Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;  

(ix) Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.   

b) General release reduction measures: When considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals listed in this Annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release of such chemicals. In cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly modified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A of Part V the following reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: 

(i) Use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption;  

(ii) Treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes that detoxify them;  

(iii) Process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as moving to closed systems;  

(iv) Modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent formation of the chemicals listed in this Annex, through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time.  
###C. Best environmental practices

The Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental practices.

### Annex   D 

####Information requirements and screening criteria

###1 

A Party submitting a proposal to list a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C shall identify the chemical in the manner described in subparagraph (a) and provide the information on the chemical, and its transformation products where relevant, relating to the screening criteria set out in subparagraphs b) to e):

a)  *Chemical identity*: 

(i) Names, including trade name or names, commercial name or names and synonyms, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry number, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name; and  

(ii) Structure, including specification of isomers, where applicable, and the structure of the chemical class;  

b)  *Persistence*: 

(i) Evidence that the half-life of the chemical in water is greater than two months, or that its half-life in soil is greater than six months, or that its half-life in sediment is greater than six months; or  

(ii) Evidence that the chemical is otherwise sufficiently persistent to justify its consideration within the scope of this Convention;  

c)  *Bio-accumulation*: 

(i) Evidence that the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor in aquatic species for the chemical is greater than 5,000 or, in the absence of such data, that the log Kow is greater than 5;  

(ii) Evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high bio-accumulation in other species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; or  

(iii) Monitoring data in biota indicating that the bio-accumulation potential of the chemical is sufficient to justify its consideration within the scope of this Convention;  

d)  *Potential for long-range environmental transport*: 

(i) Measured levels of the chemical in locations distant from the sources of its release that are of potential concern;  

(ii) Monitoring data showing that long-range environmental transport of the chemical, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment, may have occurred via air, water or migratory species; or  

(iii) Environmental fate properties and/or model results that demonstrate that the chemical has a potential for long-range environmental transport through air, water or migratory species, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment in locations distant from the sources of its release. For a chemical that migrates significantly through the air, its half-life in air should be greater than two days; and  

e)  *Adverse effects*:

####Verdrag van Stockholm inzake persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen

De Partijen bij dit Verdrag,  Erkennend dat persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen toxische eigenschappen bezitten, ongevoelig zijn voor degradatie, bioaccumuleren en door de lucht, via water en door migrerende diersoorten worden meegevoerd over internationale grenzen en ver van hun plaats van oorsprong neerslaan, waar zij accumuleren in ecosystemen op het land en in het water, Zich bewust van de zorgen op het gebied van de volksgezondheid, in het bijzonder in ontwikkelingslanden, als gevolg van de lokale blootstelling aan persistente verontreinigende stoffen, en met name de gevolgen voor vrouwen en via hen, voor de toekomstige generaties, Erkennend dat de arctische ecosystemen en inheemse gemeenschappen bijzonder bedreigd worden als gevolg van de biomagnificatie van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen en dat de besmetting van hun traditionele voedsel de volksgezondheid raakt, Zich bewust van de behoefte aan mondiale maatregelen op het gebied van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, Indachtig besluit 19/13 C van 7 februari 1997 van de Beheerraad van het Milieuprogramma van de Verenigde Naties (UNEP) voor het initiëren van internationale activiteiten ter bescherming van de gezondheid van de mens en van het milieu, in de vorm van maatregelen ter vermindering en/of beëindiging van emissies en vrijkomingen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, In herinnering roepend de van toepassing zijnde bepalingen van de relevante internationale milieuverdragen, met name het Verdrag van Rotterdam inzake voorafgaande geïnformeerde toestemming ten aanzien van gevaarlijke chemische stoffen en pesticiden in de internationale handel, en het Verdrag van Bazel inzake de beheersing van grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en de verwijdering ervan, met inbegrip van de in artikel 11 van dat Verdrag bedoelde regionale overeenkomsten, Mede in herinnering roepend de relevante bepalingen van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling en Agenda 21, Erkennend dat alle Partijen zich achter het voorzorgsbeginsel scharen, dat in dit Verdrag is verankerd, Erkennend dat dit Verdrag en andere internationale overeenkomsten op het terrein van handel en milieu elkaar ondersteunen, Herbevestigend dat de Staten, in overeenstemming met het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en de grondbeginselen van het internationale recht, het soevereine recht hebben hun eigen hulpbronnen te exploiteren volgens hun eigen milieu- en ontwikkelingsbeleid, en de verantwoordelijkheid te waarborgen dat activiteiten onder hun rechtsmacht of toezicht geen schade veroorzaken aan het milieu van andere Staten of van gebieden die buiten de grenzen van de nationale rechtsmacht vallen,  Rekening houdend met de omstandigheden en bijzondere behoeften van ontwikkelingslanden, in het bijzonder de minstontwikkelde landen hiervan, en landen met een overgangseconomie, in het bijzonder de behoefte aan versterking van hun nationale capaciteit voor het beheren van chemische stoffen, onder meer door de overdracht van technologie, de verschaffing van financiële en technische hulp en de bevordering van samenwerking tussen de Partijen, Ten volle rekening houdend met het Actieprogramma voor duurzame ontwikkeling van kleine eilandstaten die in ontwikkeling zijn, aangenomen op Barbados op 6 mei 1994, Gelet op de respectieve capaciteit van ontwikkelde en ontwikkelingslanden alsmede de gemeenschappelijke maar gedifferentieerde verantwoordelijkheden van Staten zoals vervat in Beginsel 7 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling, Erkennend de belangrijke bijdrage die de private sector en niet-gouvernementele organisaties kunnen leveren bij het realiseren van de beperking en/of beëindiging van emissies en vrijkomingen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, Benadrukkend het belang dat fabrikanten van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen de verantwoordelijkheid op zich nemen voor de terugdringing van de door hun producten veroorzaakte nadelige effecten en voor de voorlichting van gebruikers, regeringen en het publiek met betrekking tot de gevaarlijke eigenschappen van deze chemische stoffen, Zich bewust van de noodzaak maatregelen te nemen ter voorkoming van de nadelige effecten veroorzaakt door persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen in alle fasen van hun levenscyclus, Herbevestigend Beginsel 16 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling ingevolge welk nationale autoriteiten zich zouden moeten inspannen om te bevorderen dat milieukosten worden geïnternaliseerd en economische instrumenten worden toegepast, er rekening mee houdend dat de vervuiler in beginsel de kosten van de verontreiniging behoort te dragen, met inachtneming van het publieke belang en zonder de internationale handel en investeringen te verstoren, De Partijen die geen systemen voor regelgeving en beoordeling voor pesticiden en industriële chemische stoffen hebben, aanmoedigend dergelijke systemen te ontwikkelen, Erkennend het belang van de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van milieuverantwoorde alternatieve procédés en chemische stoffen, Vastberaden de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu te beschermen tegen de schadelijke effecten van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:     

### Artikel  1  

####Doel

Indachtig de voorzorgsbenadering zoals bedoeld in Beginsel 15 van de Verklaring van Rio inzake Milieu en Ontwikkeling, is het doel van dit Verdrag de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu te beschermen tegen persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen.

### Artikel  5  

####Maatregelen ter beperking of beëindiging van vrijkomingen afkomstig van onopzettelijke productie

Elke Partij treft ten minste de volgende maatregelen ter beperking van de totale vrijkomingen afkomstig uit antropogene bronnen van elk van de in Bijlage C vermelde chemische stoffen, met het doel deze vrijkomingen permament te reduceren en, waar mogelijk, deze uiteindelijk te beëindigen: 

a. ontwikkeling van een actieplan of, waar dienstig, een regionaal of subregionaal actieplan, binnen twee jaren nadat het Verdrag voor haar in werking is getreden, en uitvoering hiervan als onderdeel van haar uitvoeringsplan zoals bedoeld in artikel 7, dat is ontworpen ten behoeve van de identificatie, karakterisering en aanpak van vrijkomingen van de in Bijlage C vermelde chemische stoffen en ter vergemakkelijking van de implementatie van de leden b tot en met e. Het actieplan omvat de volgende onderdelen: 

i. een evaluatie van de huidige en voorziene vrijkomingen, met inbegrip van het opstellen en bijhouden van broninventarisaties en schattingen van vrijkomingen, rekening houdend met de in Bijlage C vermelde broncategorieën;  

ii. een evaluatie van de doeltreffendheid van door de Partij toegepaste wetten en beleidslijnen met betrekking tot de beheersing van deze vrijkomingen;  

iii. strategieën teneinde te voldoen aan de naleving van de in dit lid bedoelde verplichtingen, met inachtneming van de onder i en ii bedoelde evaluaties;  

iv. maatregelen te bevordering van educatie en training op het terrein van deze strategieën en bewustwording hiervan;  

v. een vijfjaarlijkse toetsing van die strategieën om te beoordelen of de verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit lid zijn nagekomen; de resultaten van deze toetsingen worden opgenomen in de ingevolge artikel 15 ingediende rapporten;  

vi. een tijdschema voor de uitvoering van het actieplan, alsmede voor de daarin vervatte strategieën en maatregelen;   

b. bevordering van de toepassing van beschikbare, haalbare en praktische maatregelen die het mogelijk maken snel een realistische en aanzienlijke terugdringing van vrijkomingen of de uitschakeling van de bron te bereiken; 

c. bevordering van de ontwikkeling en, wanneer zij zulks dienstig acht, het eisen van de gebruikmaking van vervangende of gewijzigde materialen, producten en processen ter voorkoming van de vorming en uitstoot van de in Bijlage C vermelde algemene richtsnoeren inzake preventie en maatregelen ter beperking van de uitstoot, met inachtneming van de in Bijlage C vermelde algemene richtsnoeren inzake preventieve maatregelen en maatregelen ter beperking van vrijkomingen en van de richtsnoeren die bij besluit van de Conferentie van de Partijen worden aangenomen; 

d. het bevorderen en, in overeenstemming met het tijdschema voor de uitvoering van haar actieplan, het eisen dat gebruik wordt gemaakt van de beste beschikbare technieken voor nieuwe bronnen binnen broncategorieën waarvan een Partij in haar actieplan heeft vermeld dat deze een dergelijke actie rechtvaardigen, met aanvankelijk bijzondere nadruk op de in Deel II van Bijlage C vermelde broncategorieën. In elk geval wordt de eis de beste beschikbare technieken te gebruiken voor nieuwe bronnen binnen de in Deel II van die Bijlage vermelde categorieën zo snel als praktisch mogelijk is, ingevoerd, doch uiterlijk vier jaren nadat het Verdrag voor die Partij in werking is getreden. Voor de geïdentificeerde categorieën bevorderen de Partijen het gebruik van de beste milieupraktijken. Bij de toepassing van de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken houden de Partijen rekening met de algemene richtsnoeren inzake maatregelen ter preventie en beperking van vrijkomingen bedoeld in Bijlage C en met de bij besluit door de Conferentie van de Partijen aan te nemen richtsnoeren inzake de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken; 

e. het, in overeenstemming met haar actieplan, bevorderen van het gebruik van de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken: 

i. voor bestaande bronnen, binnen de in Deel II van Bijlage C vermelde broncategorieën en binnen broncategorieën als die in Deel III van die Bijlage; en  

ii. voor nieuwe bronnen, binnen de in Deel III van Bijlage C vermelde broncategorieën die een Partij niet uit hoofde van onderdeel d heeft aangepakt.  Bij de toepassing van de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken houden de Partijen rekening met de algemene richtsnoeren inzake maatregelen ter preventie en beperking van vrijkomingen bedoeld in Bijlage C en met de bij besluit door de Conferentie van de Partijen aan te nemen richtsnoeren inzake de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken;

f. voor de toepassing van dit lid en Bijlage C wordt verstaan onder: 

i. „beste beschikbare technieken", het meest doeltreffende en geavanceerde ontwikkelingsstadium van de activiteiten en toepassingsmethoden, waarbij de praktische bruikbaarheid van bepaalde technieken om in beginsel te fungeren als uitgangspunt voor de vrijkomingsbeperkingen is aangetoond, met het doel de vrijkomingen te voorkomen en, wanneer dat niet mogelijk blijkt, vrijkomingen van de in Deel I van Bijlage C vermelde chemische stoffen en de effecten op het milieu in zijn geheel te beperken. In dit verband wordt verstaan onder:  

ii. „technieken", zowel de gebruikte technologie als de wijze waarop de installatie wordt ontworpen, gebouwd, onderhouden, geëxploiteerd en ontmanteld;  

iii. „beschikbare" technieken, technieken die voor de gebruiker beschikbaar zijn en die zijn ontwikkeld op een schaal die toepassing in de desbetreffende industriesector mogelijk maakt, onder economisch en technisch mogelijke voorwaarden, met inachtneming van de kosten en voordelen; en

g. voor de vervulling van haar verplichtingen ingevolge dit lid kan een Partij emissiegrenswaarden of uitvoeringsnormen hanteren.  

### Artikel  6  

####Maatregelen ter beperking of beëindiging van vrijkomingen uit voorraden en afval

1.   Teneinde te waarborgen dat voorraden bestaande uit in Bijlage A of Bijlage B vermelde chemische stoffen, of die deze bevatten, en afval, met inbegrip van producten en artikelen wanneer deze afval worden, die bestaan uit in Bijlage A, B of C vermelde chemische stoffen of deze bevatten of hiermee zijn verontreinigd, worden beheerd op een wijze die rekening houdt met de bescherming van de gezondheid van de mens en van het milieu, zal elke Partij: 

a. geschikte strategieën ontwikkelen voor de identificatie van: 

i. voorraden bestaande uit chemische stoffen vermeld in Bijlage A of Bijlage B, of die deze bevatten; en  

ii. producten en artikelen in gebruik en afval bestaande uit chemische stoffen vermeld in Bijlage A, B of C, of die deze bevatten of hiermee zijn verontreinigd;   

b. voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar voorraden bestaande uit chemische stoffen vermeld in Bijlage A of Bijlage B, of die deze bevatten, identificeren op basis van de in onderdeel a bedoelde strategieën; 

c. waar dienstig voorraden op een veilige, doeltreffende en milieuverantwoorde wijze beheren. Nadat voorraden van chemische stoffen vermeld in Bijlage A of Bijlage B niet langer mogen worden gebruikt overeenkomstig een in Bijlage A vermelde specifieke uitzondering of een in Bijlage B vermelde specifieke uitzondering of acceptabel doel worden deze, behoudens voorraden die mogen worden uitgevoerd overeenkomstig artikel 3, tweede lid, aangemerkt als afval en worden deze beheerd in overeenstemming met onderdeel d; 

d. passende maatregelen treffen om te waarborgen dat dergelijk afval, met inbegrip van producten en artikelen wanneer deze afval worden: 

i. op milieuverantwoorde wijze worden bewerkt, ingezameld, vervoerd en opgeslagen;  

ii. op zodanige wijze worden verwijderd dat de persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen die zij bevatten worden vernietigd of zodanig onomkeerbaar worden omgezet dat deze niet langer de eigenschappen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen vertonen of anderszins op een milieuverantwoorde wijze worden verwijderd wanneer vernietiging of onomkeerbare omzetting uit milieuoogpunt niet de wenselijke oplossing is of het gehalte aan persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen laag is, met inachtneming van de internationale regels, normen en richtsnoeren, met inbegrip van die welke ingevolge het tweede lid kunnen worden ontwikkeld, en de relevante mondiale en regionale stelsels die van toepassing zijn op het beheer van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen;  

iii. niet mogen worden onderworpen aan verwijderingshandelingen die kunnen leiden tot herwinning, recycling, terugwinning, rechtstreeks hergebruik of alternatieve gebruikstoepassingen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen; en  

iv. niet over internationale grenzen worden vervoerd zonder inachtneming van de relevante internationale regels, normen en richtsnoeren;  

e. ernaar streven passende strategieën te ontwikkelen voor het in kaart brengen van locaties die zijn verontreinigd met in Bijlage A, B of C vermelde chemische stoffen; indien sanering van die locaties plaatsvindt, geschiedt dit op een milieuverantwoorde wijze.    
2.   De Vergadering van de Partijen werkt nauw samen met de desbetreffende organen van het Verdrag van Bazel inzake de beheersing van de grensoverschrijdende overbrenging van gevaarlijke afvalstoffen en de verwijdering ervan teneinde, onder meer: 

a. niveaus van vernietiging en onomkeerbare omzetting vast te stellen die nodig zijn om te waarborgen dat de eigenschappen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen als bedoeld in punt 1 van Bijlage D niet aanwezig zijn;  

b. te bepalen welke methoden zij aanmerken als zijnde de hierboven bedoelde milieuverantwoorde verwijdering; en  

c. zich inspannen om, waar nodig, de concentraties van de in Bijlage A, B of C vermelde chemische stoffen vast te stellen teneinde het lage gehalte aan persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen als bedoeld in het eerste lid, onderdeel d, onder ii, te definiëren.    

### Artikel  7

1.   Elke Partij: 

a. ontwikkelt een plan voor de uitvoering van haar verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag en streeft naar de implementatie van dit plan;  

b. doet haar uitvoeringsplan binnen twee jaren, te rekenen vanaf de datum waarop dit Verdrag ten aanzien van haar in werking treedt, aan de Conferentie van de Partijen toekomen; en  

c. herziet en actualiseert waar nodig haar uitvoeringsplan periodiek en op een wijze die bij besluit door de Conferentie van de Partijen nader wordt bepaald.      
2.   De Partijen werken, waar nodig, rechtstreeks of via mondiale, regionale of subregionale organisaties samen en plegen overleg met hun nationale partners, met inbegrip van vrouwenorganisaties en groeperingen die betrokken zijn bij de gezondheid van kinderen, teneinde de ontwikkeling, implementatie en actualisering van hun uitvoeringsplannen te vergemakkelijken.   
3.   De Partijen streven ernaar middelen aan te wenden of, waar nodig, in het leven te roepen om nationale uitvoeringsplannen voor persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, waar dienstig, te integreren in hun strategieën voor duurzame ontwikkeling.  

### Artikel  8  

####Opname van chemische stoffen in Bijlagen A, B en C

1.   Een Partij kan een voorstel toezenden aan het Secretariaat voor opname van een chemische stof in Bijlage A, B en/of C. Het voorstel bevat de in Bijlage D vermelde informatie. Bij de uitwerking van een voorstel kan een Partij worden bijgestaan door andere Partijen en/of door het Secretariaat.   
2.   Het Secretariaat verifieert of het voorstel de in Bijlage D bedoelde informatie bevat. Indien het Secretariaat ervan overtuigd is dat het voorstel de desbetreffende informatie bevat, zendt het het voorstel naar de Commissie ter beoordeling van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen.   
3.   De Commissie bestudeert het voorstel en past de in Bijlage D bedoelde selectiecriteria op flexibele en doorzichtige wijze toe, waarbij alle verstrekte informatie in haar geheel en op evenwichtige wijze in acht wordt genomen.   
4.   Indien de Commissie besluit dat: 

a. aan de selectiecriteria is voldaan, stelt zij het voorstel en de beoordeling van de Commissie via het Secretariaat beschikbaar aan alle Partijen en waarnemers en nodigt zij hen uit de in Bijlage E bedoelde informatie toe te zenden; of  

b. niet aan de selectiecriteria is voldaan, brengt zij de Partijen en waarnemers hiervan via het Secretariaat op de hoogte en stelt zij het voorstel en de beoordeling van de Commissie beschikbaar aan alle Partijen en wordt het voorstel verworpen.     
5.   Elke Partij kan een door de Commissie overeenkomstig het vierde lid verworpen voorstel opnieuw indienen. Het opnieuw ingediende voorstel kan vergezeld gaan van de reden van de bezorgdheid van de Partij alsmede een motivering voor hernieuwde behandeling door de Commissie. Indien de Commissie het voorstel na deze procedure opnieuw verwerpt, kan de Partij het besluit van de Commissie betwisten en wordt de zaak door de Conferentie van de Partijen tijdens haar volgende zitting behandeld. De Conferentie van de Partijen kan aan de hand van de in Bijlage D bedoelde selectiecriteria en met inachtneming van de beoordeling van de Commissie en van de door een Partij of waarnemer verstrekte aanvullende informatie besluiten dat aan het voorstel gevolg wordt gegeven.   
6.   Wanneer de Commissie heeft besloten dat de selectiecriteria zijn vervuld, of de Conferentie van de Partijen heeft besloten dat aan het voorstel gevolg wordt gegeven, beoordeelt de Commissie het voorstel verder, rekening houdend met de ontvangen relevante aanvullende informatie, en stelt zij een ontwerp-risicoprofiel op in overeenstemming met Bijlage E. Zij stelt dit ontwerp via het Secretariaat beschikbaar aan alle Partijen en waarnemers, neemt hun technisch commentaar in ontvangst en voltooit het risicoprofiel vervolgens met inachtneming van het commentaar.   
7.   Indien de Commissie aan de hand van het overeenkomstig Bijlage E opgestelde risicoprofiel besluit: 

a. dat de chemische stof, als gevolg van de verspreiding ervan over grote afstand in het milieu waarschijnlijk tot grote nadelige gevolgen kan leiden voor de gezondheid van de mens en/of voor het milieu zodat mondiale maatregelen gerechtvaardigd zijn, vindt het voorstel doorgang. Het ontbreken van volledige wetenschappelijke zekerheid vormt geen beletsel voor de voortgang van het voorstel. De Commissie verzoekt via het Secretariaat alle Partijen en waarnemers om informatie met betrekking tot de in Bijlage F bedoelde overwegingen. Vervolgens stelt zij een risicobeheerevaluatie op die een analyse van de mogelijke controlemaatregelen omvat voor de chemische stof, overeenkomstig die Bijlage; of  

b. dat aan het voorstel geen gevolg wordt gegeven, stelt zij via het Secretariaat het risicoprofiel beschikbaar aan alle Partijen en waarnemers en verwerpt zij het voorstel.     
8.   Ten aanzien van elk ingevolge het zevende lid, onderdeel b, verworpen voorstel kan een Partij de Conferentie van de Partijen verzoeken te overwegen de Commissie de opdracht te geven de Partij die het voorstel heeft gedaan en andere Partijen te verzoeken om aanvullende informatie gedurende een tijdvak van ten hoogste een jaar. Na verloop van dat tijdvak en op basis van de ontvangen informatie, behandelt de Commissie het voorstel opnieuw ingevolge het zesde lid, met een door de Conferentie van de Partijen vast te stellen prioriteit. Indien de Commissie het voorstel na deze procedure opnieuw verwerpt, kan de Partij zich tegen het besluit verzetten en wordt de zaak door de Conferentie van de Partijen tijdens haar volgende zitting behandeld. De Conferentie van de Partijen kan aan de hand van het in overeenstemming met Bijlage E opgestelde risicoprofiel en met inachtneming van de beoordeling van de Commissie en van de door een Partij of waarnemer verstrekte aanvullende informatie besluiten dat aan het voorstel gevolg wordt gegeven. Indien de Conferentie van de Partijen besluit dat aan het voorstel gevolg wordt gegeven, stelt de Commissie de risicobeheerevaluatie op.   
9.   De Commissie doet aan de hand van het in het zesde lid bedoelde risicoprofiel en de in het zevende lid, onderdeel a, en de in het achtste lid bedoelde risicobeheerevaluatie een aanbeveling omtrent de vraag of de chemische stof door de Conferentie van de Partijen in aanmerking moet worden genomen voor opneming in Bijlage A, B en/of C.

5.   Bij de toepassing van dit artikel houden de Partijen bij hun activiteiten op het gebied van technische bijstand ten volle rekening met de bijzondere behoeften en speciale situatie van de minstontwikkelde landen en kleine eilandstaten die in ontwikkeling zijn.  

### Artikel  13  

####Financiële middelen en financieringsmechanismen

1.   Elke Partij verplicht zich waar dat tot haar mogelijkheden behoort financiële ondersteuning en prikkels ten behoeve van nationale activiteiten die bedoeld zijn om de doelstellingen van dit Verdrag te realiseren, in overeenstemming met haar nationale plannen, prioriteiten en programma's.   
2.   De ontwikkelde landen die Partij zijn verschaffen nieuwe en aanvullende financiële middelen teneinde de Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en de Partijen met een overgangseconomie in staat te stellen de overeengekomen totale marginale kosten van uitvoeringsmaatregelen te dekken die hen in staat stellen hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag na te komen, zoals overeengekomen tussen een ontvangende Partij en een aan het in het zesde lid bedoelde mechanisme deelnemende entiteit. Andere Partijen kunnen eveneens op vrijwillige basis en in overeenstemming met hun mogelijkheden dergelijke financiële middelen verschaffen. Bijdragen vanuit andere bronnen dienen eveneens te worden aangemoedigd. Bij de uitvoering van deze verplichtingen wordt rekening gehouden met de behoefte aan passende, voorzienbare en tijdige financiering en het belang van verdeling van de lasten over de bijdragende Partijen.   
3.   Ontwikkelde landen die Partij zijn, en andere Partijen in overeenstemming met hun mogelijkheden en in overeenstemming met hun nationale plannen, prioriteiten en programma's, kunnen tevens financiële middelen voor hulp bij de uitvoering van dit Verdrag verstrekken en de Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en Partijen met een overgangseconomie kunnen tevens financiële middelen voor hulp bij de uitvoering van dit Verdrag ontvangen, via andere bilaterale, regionale en multilaterale bronnen of kanalen.   
4.   De mate waarin de Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag daadwerkelijk nakomen is afhankelijk van de daadwerkelijke nakoming door de ontwikkelde landen die Partij zijn van hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag met betrekking tot de financiële middelen, technische bijstand en overdracht van technologie. Rekening wordt gehouden met het feit dat duurzame economische en sociale ontwikkeling en beëindiging van armoede absolute prioriteit genieten bij de Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn; hierbij wordt eveneens rekening gehouden met de behoefte aan de bescherming van de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu.   
5.   De Partijen houden bij hun activiteiten op het gebied van financiering ten volle rekening met de bijzondere behoeften en speciale situatie van de minstontwikkelde landen en kleine eilandstaten die in ontwikkeling zijn.   
6.   Hierbij wordt een mechanisme gedefinieerd voor het verschaffen van passende en duurzame financiële middelen aan Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en Partijen met een overgangseconomie bij wijze van gift of onder gunstige voorwaarden om hen bij te staan bij de uitvoering van het Verdrag. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag functioneert het mechanisme onder het gezag en onder de leiding van de Conferentie van de Partijen, waaraan verantwoording wordt afgelegd. Het beheer ervan wordt opgedragen aan een of meerdere entiteiten, waaronder bestaande internationale entiteiten, naar gelang de Conferentie van de Partijen besluit. Het mechanisme kan eveneens andere entiteiten omvatten die multilaterale, regionale en bilaterale financiële en technische bijstand leveren. De bijdragen aan het mechanisme komen naast andere financiële overmakingen aan Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en Partijen met een overgangseconomie zoals bedoeld in het tweede lid en in overeenstemming met dat lid.    
7.   Overeenkomstig de doelstellingen van dit Verdrag en overeenkomstig het zesde lid, neemt de Conferentie van de Partijen tijdens haar eerste zitting richtsnoeren ten behoeve van het mechanisme aan en komt zij met de aan het financiële mechanisme deelnemende entiteit of entiteiten regelingen overeen voor de uitvoering hiervan. Deze richtsnoeren behelzen onder meer: 

a. de vaststelling van prioriteiten op het gebied van beleid, strategie en programma's, alsmede duidelijke en gedetailleerde criteria en richtsnoeren met betrekking tot de voorwaarden om in aanmerking te komen voor toegang tot en gebruikmaking van financiële middelen, met inbegrip van een regelmatige monitoring en toetsing van het gebruik daarvan;  

b. de verstrekking door de entiteit of entiteiten van periodieke rapporten aan de Conferentie van de Partijen inzake de opportuniteit en duurzaamheid van de financiering van activiteiten die verband houden met de uitvoering van dit Verdrag;  

c. de bevordering van methoden, mechanismen en regelingen waarbij een beroep wordt gedaan op meerdere financieringsbronnen;  

d. de modaliteiten voor de voorspelbare en duidelijke vaststelling van het benodigde en beschikbare bedrag voor de uitvoering van dit Verdrag, rekening houdend met het feit dat voor de beëindiging van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen langdurige financiering nodig kan zijn, en de voorwaarden waaronder dit bedrag periodiek wordt herzien; en  

e. de wijze waarop aan de belanghebbende Partijen bijstand wordt verleend inzake de raming van behoeften, en informatie wordt verstrekt over beschikbare financieringsbronnen en financieringswijzen teneinde hen in staat te stellen de onderlinge coördinatie te vergemakkelijken.     
8.   De Conferentie van de Partijen beoordeelt uiterlijk tijdens haar tweede zitting en daarna periodiek, de doeltreffendheid van het ingevolge dit artikel ingestelde mechanisme, de capaciteit ervan om te voldoen aan de veranderende behoeften van Partijen die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en Partijen met een overgangseconomie, de in het zevende lid bedoelde criteria en richtsnoeren, de hoogte van financiering alsmede de doeltreffendheid van de institutionele entiteiten die belast zijn met het beheer van het financieringmechanisme. Aan de hand van deze beoordeling treft de Conferentie van de Partijen indien nodig passende maatregelen ter verbetering van de doeltreffendheid van het mechanisme, onder andere door middel van aanbevelingen en richtsnoeren inzake maatregelen ter waarborging van passende en duurzame financiering teneinde in de behoeften van de Partijen te voorzien.  

### Artikel  14  

####Voorlopige financiële regelingen

De institutionele structuur van de Global Environment Facility, die functioneert overeenkomstig de Akte tot oprichting van de geherstructureerde Global Environment Facility is, voorlopig, de belangrijkste entiteit belast met de werking van het in artikel 13 bedoelde financieringsmechanisme, gedurende het tijdvak tussen de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag en de eerste Conferentie van de Partijen, of totdat de Conferentie van de Partijen besluit welke institutionele structuur in overeenstemming met artikel 13 wordt benoemd. De institutionele structuur van de Global Environment Facility vervult deze functie door middel van operationele maatregelen die in het bijzonder verband houden met persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen, met inachtneming van het feit dat op dit gebied nieuwe regelingen nodig kunnen zijn. 

### Artikel  15  

####Verslaglegging

1.   Elke Partij brengt aan de Conferentie van de Partijen verslag uit over de door haar genomen maatregelen ter uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en over de doeltreffendheid van dergelijke maatregelen bij het bereiken van de doeleinden van het Verdrag.   
2.   Elke Partij verstrekt aan het Secretariaat: 

a. statistische gegevens met betrekking tot de in totaal geproduceerde, ingevoerde en uitgevoerde hoeveelheden van elk van de in Bijlage A of Bijlage B vermelde chemische stoffen of een redelijke schatting hiervan; en  

b. voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, een lijst van de Staten waaruit zij elk van deze stoffen heeft ingevoerd en van de Staten waarnaar zij elk van deze stoffen heeft uitgevoerd.     
3.   Deze verslaglegging vindt periodiek plaats en in een vorm die door de Conferentie van de Partijen tijdens haar eerste zitting wordt vastgesteld.  

### Artikel  16  

####Toetsing van de doeltreffendheid

1.   Vier jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, en daarna periodiek met een door de Conferentie van de Partijen te bepalen regelmaat, toetst de Conferentie van de Partijen de doeltreffendheid van dit Verdrag.   
2.   Teneinde deze toetsing te vergemakkelijken, neemt de Conferentie van de Partijen tijdens haar eerste zitting besluiten omtrent de instelling van regelingen om zichzelf te voorzien van vergelijkbare monitoringgegevens met betrekking tot de aanwezigheid van de in Bijlage A, B en C vermelde chemische stoffen alsmede tot hun regionale en mondiale verspreiding in het milieu. Deze regelingen: 

a. worden door de Partijen waar passend op regionale basis geïmplementeerd, in overeenstemming met hun technische en financiële mogelijkheden, waarbij voor zover mogelijk gebruik wordt gemaakt van bestaande monitoringprogramma's en -mechanismen, en de afstemming van de verschillende benaderingswijzen wordt bevorderd;  

b. kunnen waar nodig worden aangevuld, rekening houdend met de verschillen tussen regio's en met hun mogelijkheden om monitoringactiviteiten uit te voeren; en  

c. omvatten rapportages aan de Conferentie van de Partijen betreffende de resultaten van de monitoringactiviteiten op regionale en mondiale basis, met een door de Conferentie van de Partijen te bepalen regelmaat.     
3.   De in het eerste lid beschreven toetsing vindt plaats op basis van de beschikbare wetenschappelijke, milieu-, technische en economische gegevens, met inbegrip van: 

a. rapportages en andere ingevolge het tweede lid verstrekte monitoringinformatie;  

b. uit hoofde van artikel 15 ingediende nationale verslagen; en  

c. uit hoofde van de ingevolge artikel 17 ingestelde procedures verstrekte informatie inzake niet-naleving.    

### Artikel  17  

####Niet-naleving

Zodra dit uitvoerbaar is, worden door de Conferentie van de Partijen procedures en institutionele mechanismen ontwikkeld en goedgekeurd waarmee de naleving van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag kan worden gecontroleerd en kan worden opgetreden tegen Partijen die het Verdrag niet naleven. 

### Artikel  18  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.   Ingeval tussen Partijen een geschil ontstaat betreffende de interpretatie of de toepassing van dit Verdrag, regelen de betrokken Partijen dit geschil door middel van onderhandelingen of op een andere door henzelf te kiezen vreedzame wijze.   
2.   Bij de bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van dit Verdrag dan wel bij de toetreding hiertoe of op een later tijdstip kan een Partij die geen regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, verklaren, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de depositaris, dat zij ten aanzien van een geschil betreffende de interpretatie of de toepassing van het Verdrag één van beide of beide hierna te noemen middelen voor geschillenregeling als dwingend aanvaardt ten aanzien van elke Partij die dezelfde verplichting op zich neemt: 

a. zodra dit praktisch uitvoerbaar is, arbitrage in overeenstemming met de in een bijlage beschreven, door de Conferentie van de Partijen goed te keuren procedures;   

b. voorlegging van het geschil aan het Internationale Gerechtshof.     
3.   Een Partij die een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, kan een verklaring van gelijke strekking afleggen met betrekking tot arbitrage overeenkomstig de in het tweede lid, onder a, bedoelde procedure.   
4.   Een op grond van het tweede of derde lid afgelegde verklaring blijft van kracht totdat deze overeenkomstig de daarin vermelde voorwaarden verstreken is, of tot drie maanden na indiening van de schriftelijke kennisgeving van herroeping bij de depositaris.   
5.   Het verstrijken van een verklaring, een kennisgeving van herroeping of een nieuwe verklaring heeft hoe dan ook geen gevolgen voor geschillen die reeds bij een scheidsgerecht of bij het Internationale Gerechtshof aanhangig zijn gemaakt, tenzij de partijen bij het geschil anders overeenkomen.   
6.   Indien de partijen bij een geschil niet dezelfde of geen enkele procedure als bedoeld in het tweede lid hebben aanvaard, en indien zij er niet in geslaagd zijn hun geschil te regelen binnen twaalf maanden na de kennisgeving van de ene partij aan de andere dat tussen hen een geschil bestaat, wordt het geschil op verzoek van één van de betrokken partijen aan een verzoeningscommissie voorgelegd. De verzoeningscommissie brengt een rapport uit met aanbevelingen. Uiterlijk bij de tweede vergadering van de Conferentie van de Partijen worden aanvullende procedures met betrekking tot de verzoeningscommissie opgenomen in een door de Conferentie van de Partijen goed te keuren bijlage.  

### Artikel  19  

####Conferentie van de Partijen

1.   Hierbij wordt een Conferentie van de Partijen ingesteld.   
2.   Uiterlijk één jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag wordt de eerste Conferentie van de Partijen bijeengeroepen door de Directeur van UNEP. Daarna worden gewone vergaderingen van de Conferentie van de Partijen gehouden met een door de Conferentie te bepalen regelmaat.   
3.   Buitengewone vergaderingen van de Conferentie van de Partijen kunnen op ieder ander tijdstip worden gehouden indien de Conferentie zulks noodzakelijk acht of op schriftelijk verzoek van een Partij, op voorwaarde dat dit verzoek door ten minste eenderde van de Partijen wordt gesteund.   
4.   Tijdens haar eerste vergadering gaat de Conferentie van de Partijen bij consensus over tot goedkeuring en aanneming van een reglement van orde en een financieel reglement voor haarzelf en voor elk door haar in te stellen hulporgaan, alsmede van het financieel reglement betreffende het functioneren van het Secretariaat.    
5.   De Conferentie van de Partijen toetst en evalueert voortdurend de uitvoering van dit Verdrag. Zij vervult de haar op grond van dit Verdrag toegewezen taken en daartoe: 

a. stelt zij, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het zesde lid, de hulporganen in die zij noodzakelijk acht voor de uitvoering van het Verdrag;  

b. werkt zij, waar nodig, samen met bevoegde internationale organisaties en met gouvernementele en niet-gouvernementele organisaties; en  

c. toetst zij periodiek alle aan de Partijen ingevolge artikel 15 beschikbaar gestelde informatie, en onderzoekt zij in het bijzonder de doeltreffendheid van artikel 3, tweede lid, onderdeel b, onder iii;  

d. onderzoekt en neemt zij alle andere maatregelen die noodzakelijk kunnen zijn om de doelstellingen van dit Verdrag te verwezenlijken.     
6.   De Conferentie van de Partijen stelt tijdens haar eerste vergadering een hulporgaan in, aan te duiden als de „Toetsingscommissie persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen", om de taken uit te voeren die op grond van dit Verdrag aan die Commissie zijn toegewezen. Ter zake geldt het volgende: 

a. de leden van de Toetsingscommissie persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen worden benoemd door de Conferentie van de Partijen.

Elke Partij die DDT produceert en/of gebruikt, beperkt deze productie en/of dit gebruik tot de beheersing van ziektedragers in overeenstemming met de aanbevelingen en richtsnoeren van de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie inzake het gebruik van DDT, voor zover de betrokken Partij niet lokaal over veilige, doeltreffende en betaalbare alternatieven beschikt.

###3 

In het geval dat een niet in het DDT-register vermelde Partij vaststelt dat zij DDT nodig heeft voor de beheersing van ziektedragers, brengt zij het Secretariaat hiervan zo snel mogelijk op de hoogte zodat zij onverwijld in het DDT-register dient te worden opgenomen. Zij doet hiervan tegelijkertijd kennisgeving aan de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie.

###4 

Elke drie jaar verstrekt elke Partij die DDT gebruikt aan het Secretariaat en aan de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie informatie omtrent de gebruikte hoeveelheid, de gebruiksomstandigheden en de relevantie ervan voor de strategie inzake ziektebeheer van die Partij, in een door de Conferentie van de Partijen in overleg met de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie vast te stellen vorm.

###5 

Met het doel het gebruik van DDT te beperken en uiteindelijk uit te bannen, moedigt de Conferentie van de Partijen: 

a. elke Partij die DDT gebruikt aan een actieplan te ontwikkelen en te implementeren als onderdeel van het in artikel 7 bedoelde uitvoeringsplan. Dat actieplan omvat: 

i. de ontwikkeling van regelgevende en andere mechanismen om te waarborgen dat het gebruik van DDT wordt beperkt tot de beheersing van ziektedragers;  

ii. gebruikmaking van geschikte alternatieve producten, methoden en strategieën, met inbegrip van strategieën voor de resistentiebeheersing teneinde voortgezette doeltreffendheid van deze alternatieven te waarborgen;  

iii. maatregelen ter versterking van de gezondheidszorg en ter vermindering van het vóórkomen van de ziekte.   

b. de Partijen, waar dat tot hun mogelijkheden behoort, aan onderzoek en ontwikkeling van veilige alternatieve chemische en niet-chemische producten, methoden en strategieën te bevorderen bij Partijen die DDT gebruiken, relevant voor de situatie van die landen, teneinde de menselijke en economische last van ziekten terug te dringen. Factoren waarmee rekening moet worden gehouden bij de bestudering van alternatieven of combinaties van alternatieven zijn onder meer de risico's die deze alternatieven met zich meebrengen voor de gezondheid van de mens en voor het milieu. Levensvatbare alternatieven voor DDT behoren minder risico op te leveren voor de gezondheid van de mens en voor het milieu, geschikt te zijn voor ziektebeheersing volgens de in de desbetreffende Partijen geldende situatie en te worden ondersteund door middel van monitoringgegevens. 

###6 

Vanaf haar eerste vergadering en daarna ten minste elke drie jaar, evalueert de Conferentie van de Partijen in overleg met de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie of DDT nodig blijft voor de beheersing van ziektedragers, op basis van de beschikbare wetenschappelijke, technische, milieu- en economische informatie, met inbegrip van:

a. de productie en het gebruik van DDT en de in het tweede lid bedoelde voorwaarden;  

b. de beschikbaarheid, geschiktheid en implementatie van alternatieven voor DDT; en  

c. de vooruitgang die is geboekt bij het versterken van de capaciteit van landen om op veilige wijze over te gaan op het gebruik van die alternatieven.  

###7 

Een Partij kan zich te allen tijde door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat terugtrekken uit het DDT-register. De intrekking wordt van kracht op de in de kennisgeving vermelde datum.

###Deel III 

####Perfluoroctaansulfonzuur, de zouten daarvan en perfluoroctaansulfonylfluoride

1. De productie en het gebruik van perfluoroctaansulfonzuur (PFOS), de zouten daarvan en perfluoroctaansulfonylfluoride (PFOSF) worden door alle Partijen uitgebannen, behalve zoals voorzien in deel I van deze Bijlage voor Partijen die het Secretariaat in kennis hebben gesteld van hun voornemen deze stoffen voor acceptabele doelen te produceren en/of te gebruiken. Hierbij wordt een voor het publiek toegankelijk Register van acceptabele doelen in het leven geroepen. Het Secretariaat houdt het Register van acceptabele doelen bij. Indien een Partij die niet in het Register vermeld is vaststelt dat zij het gebruik van PFOS, de zouten daarvan of PFOSF nodig heeft voor de acceptabele doelen vermeld in deel I van deze Bijlage, stelt zij het Secretariaat daarvan zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis teneinde haar naam onverwijld te doen opnemen in het Register.  

2. Partijen die deze chemische stoffen produceren en/of gebruiken houden al naargelang van toepassing rekening met aanwijzingen zoals vermeld in de desbetreffende delen van de algemene richtsnoeren inzake de beste beschikbare technieken en milieupraktijken vermeld in deel V van Bijlage C van het Verdrag.  

3. Om de vier jaar brengt iedere Partij die deze chemische stoffen gebruikt en/of produceert verslag uit van de voortgang geboekt met het uitbannen van PFOS, de zouten daarvan en PFOSF en verschaft de Conferentie van de Partijen ingevolge en in het kader van de verslaglegging uit hoofde van artikel 15 van het Verdrag informatie over deze voortgang.  

4. Met het doel de productie en/of het gebruik van deze chemische stoffen te beperken en uiteindelijk uit te bannen, moedigt de Conferentie van de Partijen: 

a. iedere Partij die deze chemische stoffen gebruikt aan maatregelen te nemen teneinde het gebruik af te bouwen zodra er geschikte alternatieve stoffen of methoden beschikbaar zijn;  

b. iedere Partij die deze chemische stoffen gebruikt en/of produceert aan een actieplan op te stellen en te implementeren in het kader van het in artikel 7 van het Verdrag omschreven uitvoeringsplan;  

c. de Partijen aan waar dat tot hun mogelijkheden behoort het onderzoek naar en de ontwikkeling van veilige alternatieve chemische en niet-chemische producten en processen, methodes en strategieën te bevorderen voor de Partijen die deze chemische stoffen gebruiken die geschikt zijn voor de situatie van die Partijen. Factoren waarmee rekening moet worden gehouden bij de bestudering van alternatieven of combinaties van alternatieven zijn onder meer de gezondheidsrisico’s voor de mens en de effecten op het milieu van deze alternatieven.    

5. De Conferentie van de Partijen beoordeelt of deze chemische stoffen nog nodig zijn voor de diverse acceptabele doelen en de specifieke uitzonderingen op basis van beschikbare wetenschappelijke, technische, milieukundige en economische informatie, waaronder: 

a. de informatie verschaft in de in het derde lid bedoelde verslagen;  

b. informatie over de productie en het gebruik van deze chemische stoffen;  

c. informatie over de beschikbaarheid, geschiktheid en implementatie van alternatieven voor deze chemische stoffen;  

d. informatie over de voortgang die is geboekt met het opbouwen van de capaciteit van landen om op veilige wijze over te gaan op het gebruik van die alternatieven.    

6. De in het vorige lid bedoelde beoordeling geschiedt uiterlijk in 2015 en daarna om de vier jaar tegelijkertijd met een gewone zitting van de Conferentie van de Partijen.  

7. Vanwege het complexe karakter van het gebruik en de vele sectoren van de maatschappij die bij het gebruik van deze chemische stoffen betrokken zijn, kunnen er andere toepassingen van deze chemische stoffen bestaan waarvan de landen momenteel niet op de hoogte zijn. Partijen die op de hoogte raken van andere toepassingen worden aangemoedigd het Secretariaat daarvan zo spoedig mogelijk in kennis te stellen.  

8. Een Partij kan zich te allen tijde door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan het Secretariaat laten schrappen uit het Register van acceptabele doelen. De opheffing van de vermelding wordt van kracht op de datum vermeld in de kennisgeving.  

9. Het bepaalde in noot iii. in deel I van Bijlage B is niet van toepassing op deze chemische stoffen.

####Begripsomschrijvingen

###1 

Voor de toepassing van deze Bijlage wordt verstaan onder:

a. „Polychloorbifenylen", op zodanige wijze gevormde aromatische verbindingen dat de waterstofatomen op de bifenylmolecuul (twee benzeenringen die met elkaar verbonden zijn door een enkele koolstof-koolstofverbinding) kunnen worden vervangen door maximaal tien chlooratomen; en  

b. „Polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen" en „polychloordibenzofuranen", tricyclische aromatische verbindingen die bestaan uit twee benzeenringen die met elkaar verbonden zijn door twee zuurstofatomen in polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen en één zuurstofatoom en één koolstofatoom in polychloordibenzofuranen en waarvan de waterstofatomen kunnen worden vervangen door maximaal acht chlooratomen.  

###2 

In deze Bijlage wordt de toxiciteit van polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen en polychloordibenzofuranen uitgedrukt door middel van gebruikmaking van het begrip toxische equivalentie waarmee de relatieve toxische activiteit van het type dioxine wordt gemeten van verschillende verwanten van polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen en polychloordibenzofuranen en coplanaire polychloorbifenylen in vergelijking met 2,3,7,8-tetrachloordibenzo-p-dioxine. De in het kader van dit Verdrag te hanteren toxische equivalentiefactoren moeten overeenkomen met de aanvaarde internationale normen, te beginnen met de door de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie in 1998 gepubliceerde toxische equivalentiefactoren voor zoogdieren voor polychloordibenzo-p-dioxinen en polychloordibenzofuranen en coplanaire polychloorbifenylen. De concentraties worden uitgedrukt in toxische equivalentie.

###Deel V 

####Algemene richtsnoeren inzake de beste beschikbare technieken en de beste milieupraktijken 

Dit Deel omvat algemene richtsnoeren voor de Partijen voor de preventie of beperking van het vrijkomen van de in Deel I vermelde chemische stoffen.
###A. Algemene preventieve maatregelen met betrekking tot zowel de beste beschikbare technieken als de beste milieupraktijken 

Prioriteit moet worden gegeven aan de bestudering van een aanpak waarmee de vorming en het vrijkomen van in Deel I vermelde chemische stoffen worden voorkomen. De volgende maatregelen kunnen als nuttig worden aangemerkt:

a. het gebruik van technologie die weinig afval oplevert;  

b. het gebruik van minder gevaarlijke stoffen;  

c. de bevordering van terugwinning en hergebruik van afvalstoffen en van stoffen die tijdens het proces ontstaan en worden gebruikt;   

d. vervanging van uitgangsmateriaal dat bestaat uit persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen of dat rechtstreeks verband houdt met het vrijkomen van persistente organische verontreinigende stoffen uit de bron;  

e. programma's voor goed beheer en preventief onderhoud;  

f. verbetering van het afvalbeheer, gericht op het staken van verbranding van afval in de open lucht en andere ongecontroleerde verbranding, zoals op afvalstortplaatsen. Bij de bestudering van voorstellen voor de bouw van nieuwe afvalverwijderingsinstallaties moeten alternatieven worden bestudeerd, zoals activiteiten ter maximale beperking van huishoudelijk en medisch afval, met inbegrip van bronherwinning, hergebruik en recycling van afval, afvalscheiding en bevordering van producten die minder afval genereren. In dit verband moet zorgvuldig rekening worden gehouden met de zorg voor de volksgezondheid;  

g. het tot een minimum beperken van deze chemische stoffen als verontreinigingen in producten; 

h. voorkomen dat elementair chloor of chemische stoffen die elementair chloor produceren worden gebruikt voor bleekprocessen. 
###B. Beste beschikbare technieken 

De ratio van de beste beschikbare technieken is niet gericht op het voorschrijven van een specifieke techniek of technologie, maar doelt op de technische eigenschappen van de desbetreffende installatie, de geografische ligging ervan en de plaatselijke milieusituatie. Geschikte controletechnieken voor de beperking van het vrijkomen van de in Deel I vermelde chemische stoffen zijn in het algemeen hetzelfde. Bij de bepaling van de beste beschikbare technieken moet in het algemeen of in specifieke gevallen aandacht worden besteed aan de onderstaande factoren, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met de te verwachten kosten en baten van een maatregel en het voorzorg- en preventiebeginsel:

a. Algemene overwegingen: 

i. de aard, de gevolgen en de massa van de desbetreffende gevallen van vrijkomende chemische stoffen: de technieken kunnen afhankelijk van de omvang van de bron uiteenlopen;  

ii. de datum van ingebruikneming van de nieuwe of bestaande installaties;  

iii. de tijd die nodig is voor het omschakelen op een betere beschikbare techniek;  

iv. het verbruik en de aard van de grondstoffen die bij het proces worden gebruikt en de energie-efficiëntie daarvan;  

v. de noodzaak de algehele milieu-effecten en milieurisico's van vrijkomende chemische stoffen te voorkomen of tot een minimum te beperken;  

vi. de noodzaak om ongevallen te voorkomen en de gevolgen daarvan voor het milieu tot een minimum te beperken;   

vii. de noodzaak van bedrijfsveiligheid en gezondheid op het werk;  

viii. vergelijkbare processen, installaties of toepassingsmethoden die met succes op industriële schaal zijn beproefd;  

ix. de vooruitgang van de techniek en de ontwikkeling van de wetenschappelijke kennis.   

b. Algemene maatregelen ter beperking van vrijkomende chemische stoffen: Bij het bestuderen van voorstellen voor de bouw van nieuwe installaties of ingrijpende wijziging van bestaande installaties waarbij processen worden gebruikt waarbij in deze Bijlage vermelde chemische stoffen vrijkomen, moet bij voorrang aandacht worden geschonken aan alternatieve processen, technieken of methoden die even nuttig zijn maar waarbij deze chemische stoffen niet worden gevormd en vrijkomen. In gevallen waarin deze installaties worden gebouwd of ingrijpend worden gewijzigd, kunnen ter vaststelling van de beste beschikbare technieken, naast de in Afdeling A van Deel V genoemde maatregelen de volgende beperkende maatregelen in overweging worden genomen: 

i. gebruikmaking van verbeterde methoden voor de reiniging van rookgassen, zoals thermische of katalitische oxidatie, stofvangers of adsorptie;  

ii. behandeling van restmaterialen, afvalwater, afval en zuiveringsslib, bijvoorbeeld door verhitting of door ze inert te maken of door chemische processen die ze ontgiften;  

iii. wijzigingen in het procédé die leiden tot de vermindering of opheffing van vrijkomingen, zoals het gebruik van gesloten systemen;  

iv. wijziging van procédés om voor een betere verbranding te zorgen en om de vorming van de in deze Bijlage vermelde chemische stoffen te voorkomen, door de aanpassing van parameters als de verbrandingstemperatuur en de verblijftijd.  
###C. Beste milieupraktijken 

De Conferentie van de Partijen kan richtsnoeren ontwikkelen met betrekking tot de beste milieupraktijken.

Indien een van de partijen bij het geschil niet voor het scheidsgerecht verschijnt of haar zaak niet verdedigt, kan de andere partij het scheidsgerecht verzoeken de procedure voort te zetten en zijn beslissing te nemen. Het feit dat een partij niet voor het scheidsgerecht verschijnt of haar zaak niet verdedigt, vormt geen belemmering voor de voortzetting van de procedure.

Elk lid van het scheidsgerecht kan een afzonderlijke of afwijkende mening toevoegen aan de definitieve uitspraak. 

### Artikel  16  

De uitspraak is bindend voor de partijen bij het geschil. De interpretatie van het Verdrag in een uitspraak is tevens bindend voor een partij die zich ingevolge artikel 10 van deze regeling heeft gevoegd, voor zover zij betrekking heeft op aangelegenheden ter zake waarvan de partij zich heeft gevoegd. Tegen de uitspraak staat geen beroep open, tenzij de partijen bij het geschil vooraf overeenstemming hebben bereikt over een beroepsprocedure.

Meningsverschillen die mogelijk ontstaan tussen de partijen die gebonden zijn door de definitieve uitspraak in overeenstemming met artikel 16 van deze regeling met betrekking tot de interpretatie of wijze van tenuitvoerlegging van die uitspraak kunnen door elk van de partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan het scheidsgerecht dat de uitspraak heeft gedaan.
