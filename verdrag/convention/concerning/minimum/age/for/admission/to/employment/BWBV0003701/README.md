### Recommendation  146  

####Recommendation concerning minimum age for admission to employment

The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Fifty-eighth Session on 6 June 1973, and Recognising that the effective abolition of child labour and the progressive raising of the minimum age for admission to employment constitute only one aspect of the protection and advancement of children and young persons, and Noting the concern of the whole United Nations system with such protection and advancement, and Having adopted the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, and Desirous to define further certain elements of policy which are the concern of the International Labour Organisation, and Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals regarding minimum age for admission to employment, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, and Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of a Recommendation supplementing the Minimum Age Convention, 1973,   adopts this twenty-sixth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-three the following Recommendation, which may be cited as the Minimum Age Recommendation, 1973:    

### I  

####National policy

1. To ensure the success of the national policy provided for in Article 1 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, high priority should be given to planning for and meeting the needs of children and youth in national development policies and programmes and to the progressive extension of the inter-related measures necessary to provide the best possible conditions of physical and mental growth for children and young persons.  

2. In this connection special attention should be given to such areas of planning and policy as the following: 

(a) firm national commitment to full employment, in accordance with the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, and the taking of measures designed to promote employment-oriented development in rural and urban areas;  

(b) the progressive extension of other economic and social measures to alleviate poverty wherever it exists and to ensure family living standards and income which are such as to make it unnecessary to have recourse to the economic activity of children;  

(c) the development and progressive extension, without any discrimination, of social security and family welfare measures aimed at ensuring child maintenance, including children's allowances;  

(d) the development and progressive extension of adequate facilities for education and vocational orientation and training appropriate in form and content to the needs of the children and young persons concerned;  

(e) the development and progressive extension of appropriate facilities for the protection and welfare of children and young persons, including employed young persons, and for the promotion of their development.    

3. Particular account should as necessary be taken of the needs of children and young persons who do not have families or do not live with their own families and of migrant children and young persons who live and travel with their families. Measures taken to that end should include the provision of fellowships and vocational training.  

4. Full-time attendance at school or participation in approved vocational orientation or training programmes should be required and effectively ensured up to an age at least equal to that specified for admission to employment in accordance with Article 2 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973.  

5. 
(1) Consideration should be given to measures such as preparatory training, not involving hazards, for types of employment or work in respect of which the minimum age prescribed in accordance with Article 3 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, is higher than the age of completion of compulsory full-time schooling.  

(2) Analogous measures should be envisaged where the professional exigencies of a particular occupation include a minimum age for admission which is higher than the age of completion of compulsory fulltime schooling.      

### II  

####Minimum age

6. The minimum age should be fixed at the same level for all sectors of economic activity.  

7. 

(1) Members should take as their objective the progressive raising to 16 years of the minimum age for admission to employment or work specified in pursuance of Article 2 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973.  

(2) Where the minimum age for employment or work covered by Article 2 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, is still below 15 years, urgent steps should be taken to raise it to that level.    

8. Where it is not immediately feasible to fix a minimum age for all employment in agriculture and in related activities in rural areas, a minimum age should be fixed at least for employment on plantations and in the other agricultural undertakings referred to in Article 5, paragraph 3, of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973.    

### III  

####Hazardous employment or work

9. Where the minimum age for admission to types of employment or work which are likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons is still below 18 years, immediate steps should be taken to raise it to that level.  

10. 

(1) In determining the types of employment or work to which Article 3 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, applies, full account should be taken of relevant international labour standards, such as those concerning dangerous substances, agents or processes (including ionising radiations), the lifting of heavy weights and underground work.  

(2) The list of the types of employment or work in question should be re-examined periodically and revised as necessary, particularly in the light of advancing scientific and technological knowledge.    

11. Where, by reference to Article 5 of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, a minimum age is not immediately fixed for certain branches of economic activity or types of undertakings, appropriate minimum age provisons should be made applicable therein to types of employment or work presenting hazards for young persons.    

### IV  

####Conditions of employment

12. 

(1) Measures should be taken to ensure that the conditions in which children and young persons under the age of 18 years are employed or work reach and are maintained at a satisfactory standard. These conditions should be supervised closely.  

(2) Measures should likewise be taken to safeguard and supervise the conditions in which children and young persons undergo vocational orientation and training within undertakings, training institutions and schools for vocational or technical education and to formulate standards for their protection and development.    

13. 

(1) In connection with the application of the preceding Paragraph, as well as in giving effect to Article 7, paragraph 3, of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, special attention should be given to - 

(a) the provision of fair remuneration and its protection, bearing in mind the principle of equal pay for equal work;  

(b) the strict limitation of the hours spent at work in a day and in a week, and the prohibition of overtime, so as to allow enough time for education and training (including the time needed for homework related thereto), for rest during the day and for leisure activities;  

(c) the granting, without possibility of exception save in genuine emergency, of a minimum consecutive period of 12 hours' night rest, and of customary weekly rest days;  

(d) the granting of an annual holiday with pay of at least four weeks and, in any case, not shorter than that granted to adults;  

(e) coverage by social security schemes, including employment injury medical care and sickness benefit schemes, whatever the conditions of employment or work may be;  

(f) the maintenance of satisfactory standards of safety and health and appropriate instruction and supervision.    

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) of this Paragraph applies to young seafarers in so far as they are not covered in respect of the matters dealt with therein by international labour Conventions or Recommendations specifically concerned with maritime employment.      

### V  

####Enforcement

14. 

(1) Measures to ensure the effective application of the Minimum Age Convention, 1973, and of this Recommendation should include - 

(a) the strengthening as necessary of labour inspection and related services, for instance by the special training of inspectors to detect abuses in the employment or work of children and young persons and to correct such abuses; and  

(b) the strengthening of services for the improvement and inspection of training in undertakings.    

(2) Emphasis should be placed on the role which can be played by inspectors in supplying information and advice on effective means of complying with relevant provisions as well as in securing their enforcement.  

(3) Labour inspection and inspection of training in undertakings should be closely co-ordinated to provide the greatest economic efficiency and, generally, the labour administration services should work in close co-operation with the services responsible for the education, training, welfare and guidance of children and young persons.    

15. Special attention should be paid - 

(a) to the enforcement of provisions concerning employment in hazardous types of employment or work; and  

(b) in so far as education or training is compulsory, to the prevention of the employment or work of children and young persons during the hours when instruction is available.    

16. The following measures should be taken to facilitate the verification of ages: 

(a) the public authorities should maintain an effective system of birth registration, which should include the issue of birth certificates;  

(b) employers should be required to keep and to make available to the competent authority registers or other documents indicating the names and ages or dates of birth, duly certified wherever possible, not only of children and young persons employed by them but also of those receiving vocational orientation or training in their undertakings;  

(c) children and young persons working in the streets, in outside stalls, in public places, in itinerant occupations or in other circumstances which make the checking of employers' records impracticable should be issued licences or other documents indicating their eligibility for such work.      

The foregoing is the authentic text of the Recommendation duly adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation during its Fifty-eighth Session which was held at Geneva and declared closed the twenty-seventh day of June 1973. IN FAITH WHEREOF we have appended our signatures this twentyseventh day of June 1973.  *The President of the Conference,*  (sd.)

### Aanbeveling  146  

####Aanbeveling betreffende de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot het arbeidsproces

De Algemene Conferentie van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, Bijeengeroepen te Genève door de Raad van Beheer van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau en aldaar in haar achtenvijftigste zitting bijeengekomen op 6 juni 1973; Erkennende dat de daadwerkelijke afschaffing van de kinderarbeid en de geleidelijke verhoging van de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot het arbeidsproces slechts één aspect vormen van de bescherming en de ontwikkeling van kinderen en jeugdige personen; Gelet op de wens van het gehele systeem der Verenigde Naties deze bescherming en ontwikkeling te waarborgen; Het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, aangenomen hebbende; Geleid door de wens op dit terrein een nadere omschrijving te geven van bepaalde beleidselementen, behorende tot het domein van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie; Besloten hebbende tot het aanvaarden van diverse voorstellen betreffende de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot het arbeidsproces, welk onderwerp als vierde punt op de agenda van de zitting voorkomt; Besloten hebbende dat deze voorstellen de vorm zullen hebben van een Aanbeveling, ter aan vulling van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973,   neemt heden, de zesentwintigste juni negentienhonderddrieënzeventig, de volgende Aanbeveling aan, die kan worden aangehaald als Aanbeveling betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973:    

### I  

####Nationaal beleid

1. Ten einde het in artikel 1 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, beoogde doel te bereiken, dienen het nationaal beleid en de nationale ontwikkelingsprogramma's een hoge prioriteit toe te kennen aan het treffen van maatregelen met het oog op de behoeften van kinderen en jeugdige personen, aan het scheppen van voorzieningen die aan deze behoeften tegemoetkomen, alsmede aan een geleidelijke uitbreiding van gecoördineerde maatregelen; noodzakelijk om de lichamelijke en geestelijke ontwikkeling van kinderen en jeugdige personen in de meest gunstige omstandigheden te waarborgen.  

2. In het kader van deze programma's en maatregelen dient bijzondere aandacht te worden besteed aan punten als: 

a) de door ieder land aanvaarde verplichting een beleid te voeren inzake volledige werkgelegenheid, overeenkomstig het Verdrag en de Aanbeveling betreffende het beleid inzake de werkgelegenheid, 1964, alsmede het aanvaarden van maatregelen die ten doel hebben op het platteland en in de stedelijke gebieden een op de werkgelegenheid gerichte ontwikkeling te bevorderen;  

b) de geleidelijke uitbreiding van andere economische en sociale maatregelen ten einde de armoede, waar deze bestaat, te verminderen en de gezinnen een zodanige levensstandaard en een zodanig inkomensniveau te waarborgen dat zij niet hun toevlucht behoeven te nemen tot economische activiteiten van kinderen;  

c) de aanvaarding en geleidelijke uitbreiding, zonder enige vorm van discriminatie, van bepalingen betreffende de sociale zekerheid en van maatregelen aangaande het welzijn van de gezinnen, die ten doel hebben de verzorging van de kinderen, met inbegrip van de toekenning van kinderbijslag, te waarborgen;  

d) het scheppen en geleidelijk uitbreiden van voldoende faciliteiten ten aanzien van de opvoeding, beroepsoriëntatie en -opleiding, die zowel naar vorm als naar inhoud zijn aangepast aan de behoeften van de betrokken kinderen en jeugdige personen;  

e) het scheppen en geleidelijk uitbreiden van geëigende faciliteiten, gericht op de bescherming en het welzijn van kinderen en jeugdige personen (met inbegrip van tewerkgestelde jeugdige personen) alsmede het bevorderen van hun ontwikkeling.    

3. Voor zover noodzakelijk dient bijzondere aandacht te worden geschonken aan de behoeften van kinderen en jeugdige personen die niet tot een gezin behoren of niet in gezinsverband leven, en aan migrerende kinderen en jeugdige personen die leven en reizen in gezinsverband. De in dit opzicht te nemen maatregelen dienen met name de toekenning van beurzen en de beroepsopleiding te behelzen.  

4. Volledig dagonderwijs of volledige deelname aan goedgekeurde programma's voor beroepskeuzevoorlichting of programma's voor beroepsopleiding dient verplicht te zijn en op doeltreffende wijze te worden gewaarborgd tot op een leeftijd die ten minste gelijk is aan de leeftijd voor toelating tot de arbeid, zoals die is omschreven in artikel 2 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973.  

5. 

(1) Maatregelen dienen te wórden overwogen zoals een voorbereidende, risicovrije opleiding, voor die vormen van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband waarvoor de voorgeschreven minimumleeftijd, overeenkomstig artikel 3 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, hoger is dan de leeftijd waarop de leerplicht voor volledig dagonderwijs eindigt.  

(2) Soortgelijke maatregelen dienen te worden overwogen wanneer de eisen voor een bepaald beroep een minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot de arbeid omvatten die hoger is dan de leeftijd waarop de leerplicht voor volledig dagonderwijs eindigt.      

### II  

####Minimumleeftijd

6. De minimumleeftijd dient voor alle economische bedrijfstakken dezelfde te zijn.  

7. 

(1) De Leden dienen zich als doel te stellen de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot arbeid in en buiten dienstverband, zoals bedoeld in artikel 2 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, geleidelijk op zestien jaar te brengen.  

(2) Wanneer de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot arbeid in en buiten dienstverband, zoals bedoeld in artikel 2 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, nog steeds lager is dan vijftien jaar, dienen zo spoedig mogelijk maatregelen te worden genomen om de minimumleeftijd op dat niveau te brengen.    

8. Wanneer het niet mogelijk is onmiddellijk een minimumleeftijd vast te stellen voor alle vormen van arbeid in de landbouw en voor aanverwante werkzaamheden die op het platteland worden uitgevoerd, dient een dergelijke leeftijd tenminste te worden vastgesteld voor arbeid op plantages en andere landbouwbedrijven, zoals bedoeld in artikel 5, derde lid, van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973.    

### III  

####Gevaarlijke arbeid in en buiten dienstverband

9. Wanneer de minimumleeftijd voor toelating tot die vormen van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband die schadelijk zijn voor de gezondheid, veiligheid of zedelijkheid van jeugdige personen, lager is dan achttien jaar, dienen onverwijld maatregelen te worden genomen om de minimumleeftijd op dat niveau te brengen.  

10. 

(1) Bij het bepalen van de vormen van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband zoals bedoeld in artikel 3 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973 dient ten volle rekening te worden gehouden met de desbetreffende internationale arbeidsnormen, bijvoorbeeld de normen betreffende giftige stoffen of middelen of gevaarlijke processen (met inbegrip van de normen betreffende ioniserende straling,) het vervoer van zware vrachten en ondergrondse arbeid.  

(2) De desbetreffende lijst van werkzaamheden in en buiten dienstverband dient op geregelde tijden opnieuw te worden nagegaan en naar behoefte te worden herzien, met name in het licht van de vooruitgang van wetenschap en techniek.    

11. Wanneer krachtens artikel 5 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, niet onmiddellijk een minimumleeftijd is vastgesteld voor bepaalde economische bedrijfstakken of soorten ondernemingen, dienen niettemin gepaste voorzieningen inzake de minimumleeftijd te worden getroffen die van toepasssing zijn op die vormen van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband die risico's meebrengen voor jeugdige personen.    

### IV  

####Arbeidsvoorwaarden

12. 

(1) Maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen om de arbeidsvoorwaarden van kinderen en jeugdige personen van nog geen achttien jaar op een bevredigend niveau te handhaven. Deze voorwaarden dienen aan een strenge controle te worden onderworpen.  

(2) Eveneens dienen maatregelen te worden genomen om de voorwaarden waaronder de beroepskeuzevoorlichting en beroepsopleiding aan kinderen en jeugdige personen wordt gegeven in ondernemingen, instellingen voor beroepsopleiding en vakscholen of technische scholen, te waarborgen en te controleren en om regels op te stellen betreffende de bescherming en ontwikkeling van kinderen en jeugdige personen.    

13. 

(1) Voor de toepassing van het voorgaande lid en ten einde uitvoering te geven aan het derde lid van artikel 7 van het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973, dient bijzondere aandacht te worden geschonken aan de volgende punten: 

a) de toekenning van een billijke beloning alsmede bescherming van het salaris, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met het beginsel: „gelijk loon voor gelijke arbeid";  

b) een strikte beperking van de dagelijkse en wekelijkse arbeidsduur en een verbod op overuren, ten einde voldoende tijd te reserveren voor de opvoeding en vorming- met inbegrip van de voor het huiswerk benodigde tijd -, voor de dagelijkse rustpauze en de vrijetijdsbesteding;  

c) het garanderen van een nachtrust van ten minste twaalf achtereenvolgende uren alsmede van wekelijkse rustdagen volgens gebruik, zonder dat hierop een uitzondering kan worden gemaakt, behalve in geval van nood;  

d) het toekennen van een jaarlijkse betaalde vakantie van ten minste vier weken en in ieder geval van een duur die ten minste gelijk is aan die van de vakantie die aan volwassen personen wordt toegekend;  

e) bescherming door regelingen op het gebied van sociale zekerheid, met inbegrip van regelingen inzake uitkeringen, in geval van bedrijfsongevallen en beroepsziekten, en regelingen betreffende medische behandeling en ziektekosten vergoeding, ongeacht de arbeidsvoorwaarden;  

f) het toepassen van bevredigende normen betreffende de veiligheid en de gezondheid met inbegrip van de hiertoe te geven opleiding en de te verrichten controle.    

(2) Punt 1 van deze paragraaf is van toepassing op jeugdige zeelieden, voor zover zij ter zake niet zijn beschermd door de internationale arbeidsverdragen en -aanbevelingen, speciaal gericht op de arbeid als zeevarende.      

### V  

####Uitvoering

14. 

(1) Maatregelen bestemd om uitvoering te geven aan het Verdrag betreffende de minimumleeftijd, 1973 en aan deze Aanbeveling, dienen het volgende te omvatten: 

a) het versterken, voor zover noodzakelijk, van de arbeidsinspectie en aanverwante diensten, bijvoorbeeld door de inspecteurs in het bijzonder te instrueren inzake het opsporen en tegengaan van misbruiken betreffende de arbeid in en buiten dienstverband van kinderen en jeugdige personen;  

b) het versterken van de diensten belast met de verbetering en de inspectie van de beroepsopleiding in de onderneming.    

(2) Met nadruk dient gewezen te worden op het belang van de rol, die de inspecteurs kunnen vervullen door inlichtingen en adviezen te verstrekken inzake de middelen die een doeltreffende toepassing van de desbetreffende bepalingen mogelijk maken, alsmede door de uitvoering van deze bepalingen te waarborgen.  

(3) De arbeidsinspectie en de controle op de beroepsopleiding in het bedrijf dienen nauw samen te werken, ten einde een zo groot mogelijke economische doeltreffendheid te waarborgen; in het algemeen dienen de diensten die zich met de arbeid bezighouden te functioneren in nauwe samenwerking met de diensten die zich bezighouden met de opvoeding, de vorming, het welzijn en de beroepskeuzevoorlichting van kinderen en jeugdige personen.    

15. Bijzondere aandacht dient te worden besteed: 

a) aan de toepassing van de bepalingen betreffende gevaarlijke vormen van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband;  

b) voor zover vorming of opleiding verplicht zijn, aan het tegengaan van arbeid in en buiten dienstverband van kinderen en jeugdige personen tijdens de lesuren.    

16. De volgende maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen om de controle op de leeftijd van de betrokken personen te vergemakkelijken: 

a) de overheid dient zorgt te dragen voor een doeltreffend systeem ter registratie van de geboorten, inhoudende de afgifte van geboortebewijzen;  

b) de werkgevers dienen de verplichting te hebben registers of andere documenten ter beschikking te houden van de bevoegde autoriteit, waarin vermeld worden de naam en de leeftijd of geboortedatum, voor zover mogelijk behoorlijk gewaarmerkt, niet alleen van de door hen tewerkgestelde kinderen en jeugdige personen, maar ook van diegenen die beroepskeuzevoorlichting of een beroepsopleiding in hun bedrijf ontvangen;  

c) aan kinderen en jeugdige personen die arbeiden op de openbare weg, in uitstallingen op straat, of in openbare gelegenheden, of die werkzaam zijn in ambulante beroepen of andere beroepen waarbij de controle op dergelijke registers of andere documenten niet mogelijk is, dienen vergunningen of andere documenten te worden verstrekt, waaruit blijkt dat zij voldoen aan de voorwaarden voor de desbetreffende arbeid.
