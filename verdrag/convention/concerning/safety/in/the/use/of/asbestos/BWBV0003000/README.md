In overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving en praktijk dienen werkgevers afval dat asbest bevat, op zodanige wijze af te voeren dat dit noch voor de betrokken werknemers, met inbegrip van diegenen die asbestafval hanteren, noch voor de bevolking in de buurt van de onderneming gevaar voor de gezondheid oplevert.

####TOEZICHT OP HET WERKMILIEU EN DE GEZONDHEID VAN DE WERKNEMERS

### Artikel  20  

1.  Waar dit voor de bescherming van de gezondheid van werknemers noodzakelijk is, dient de werkgever de concentraties van asbeststof dat in de lucht is geraakt op de werkplek te meten en de blootstelling van werknemers aan asbest bij tussenpozen te controleren, onder toepassing van methodes die door de bevoegde autoriteit zijn gespecificeerd.

Voor werknemers die aan asbest zijn of waren blootgesteld, dienen in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving en praktijk, die medische onderzoeken beschikbaar te zijn die nodig zijn voor het toezicht op hun gezondheid in verband met het beroepsgevaar en om beroepsziekten veroorzaakt door blootstelling aan asbest, te diagnostiseren.   
2.  Het controleren van de gezondheid van werknemers in verband met het gebruik van asbest dient niet in verlies van verdiensten voor hen te resulteren. Het dient kosteloos te zijn, en voor zover mogelijk, tijdens de werkuren plaats te vinden.   
3.  Werknemers dienen op adequate en passende manier te worden ingelicht over de resultaten van hun medische onderzoeken en individueel advies te krijgen betreffende hun gezondheid met betrekking tot hun werk.   
4.  Indien het voortgezet opdragen van werk dat blootstelling aan asbest met zich meebrengt, medisch gezien niet raadzaam blijkt te zijn, dient, in overeenstemming met de nationale omstandigheden en praktijk, alle moeite te worden gedaan om de betrokken werknemers andere mogelijkheden te bieden om hun inkomen te behouden.   
5.  De bevoegde autoriteit dient een systeem te ontwikkelen voor de melding van door asbest veroorzaakte beroepsziekten.

3.  De werkgever dient te waarborgen, dat alle werknemers die aan asbest zijn of waarschijnlijk worden blootgesteld, over de gevaren voor de gezondheid die hun werk met zich meebrengt worden ingelicht, over preventieve maatregelen en correcte werkmethodes worden geïnstrueerd en op deze terreinen steeds scholing blijven krijgen.
