a. in stamverband levende volken in onafhankelijke landen, wier sociale, culturele en economische omstandigheden hen onderscheiden van andere delen van de nationale gemeenschap en wier status geheel of gedeeltelijk wordt geregeld door hun eigen gewoonten of tradities of door bijzondere wetten of voorschriften;  

b. volken in onafhankelijke landen, die als inheems worden beschouwd wegens hun afstamming van de volken die het land of een geografisch gebied waartoe het land behoort, bewoonden op het tijdstip waarop het werd veroverd of gekoloniseerd of waarop de huidige grenzen van de staat werden vastgesteld en die, ongeacht hun wettelijke status, sommige of al hun eigen sociale, economische, culturele en politieke instellingen, hebben behouden.     
2.  Het gevoel inheems te zijn of te behoren tot een stam dient te worden aangemerkt als fundamenteel criterium om te bepalen op welke groepen de bepalingen van dit Verdrag van toepassing zijn.   
3.  Het gebruik van de term „volken” in dit Verdrag kan op generlei wijze zo worden uitgelegd dat dit implicaties heeft ten aanzien van de rechten die ingevolge het internationale recht aan deze term zijn verbonden.   

### Artikel  2

### Artikel  3  

1.  Inheemse en in stamverband levende volken dienen het volle genot te hebben van de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden, zonder belemmering of discriminatie. De bepalingen van het Verdrag dienen zonder onderscheid te worden toegepast op mannen en vrouwen van deze volken.   
2.  Er mag geen enkele vorm van geweld of dwang worden gebruikt waardoor de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden van de betrokken volken, met inbegrip van de in dit Verdrag vervatte rechten, zouden worden geschonden.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  Waar nodig dienen speciale maatregelen te worden getroffen om de personen, de instellingen, de bezittingen, het werk, de cultuur en het leefmilieu van de betrokken volken veilig te stellen.   
2.  Zulke speciale maatregelen mogen niet in strijd zijn met de vrij tot uitdrukking gebrachte wensen van de betrokken volken.   
3.  Het genot van de algemene burgerrechten, zonder onderscheid, mag op geen enkele wijze door zulke speciale maatregelen worden geschaad.   

### Artikel  5  

Bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag:
