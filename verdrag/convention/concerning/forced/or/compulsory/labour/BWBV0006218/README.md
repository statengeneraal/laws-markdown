INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.  

*Convention concerning forced or compulsory labour.*  The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Fourteenth Session on 10 June 1930, and Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to forced or compulsory labour, which is included in the first item on the Agenda of the Session, and Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international convention,   adopts, this twenty-eighth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty, the following Convention, which may be cited as the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, for ratification by the Members of the International Labour Organisation, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation:    

### Article  1  

1.  Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to suppress the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms within the shortest possible period.   
2.  With a view to this complete suppression, recourse to forced or compulsory labour may be had, during the transitional period, for public purposes only and as an exceptional measure, subject to the conditions and guarantees hereinafter provided.   
3.  At the expiration of a period of five years after the coming into force of this Convention, and when the Governing Body of the International Labour Office prepares the report provided for in Article 31 below, the said Governing Body shall consider the possibility of the suppression of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms without a further transitional period and the desirability of placing this question on the Agenda of the Conference.   

### Article  2  

1.  For the purposes of this Convention the term „forced or compulsory labour” shall mean all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.   
2.  Nevertheless, for the purposes of this Convention, the term „forced or compulsory labour” shall not include: 

(a) any work or service exacted in virtue of compulsory military service laws for work of a purely military character;  

(b) any work or service which forms part of the normal civic obligations of the citizens of a fully self-governing country;  

(c) any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court of law, provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a public authority and that the said person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations;  

(d) any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of war or of a calamity or threatened calamity, such as fire, flood, famine, earthquake, violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, invasion by animal, insect or vegetable pests, and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population;  

(e) minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered as normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services.     

### Article  3  

For the purposes of this Convention the term „competent authority” shall mean either an authority of the metropolitan country or the highest central authority in the territory concerned.  

### Article  4  

1.  The competent authority shall not impose or permit the imposition of forced or compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals, companies or associations.   
2.  Where such forced or compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals, companies or associations exists at the date on which a Member's ratification of this Convention is registered by the Director-General of the International Labour Office, the Member shall completely suppress such forced or compulsory labour from the date on which this Convention comes into force for that Member.   

### Article  5  

1.  No concession granted to private individuals, companies or associations shall involve any form of forced or compulsory labour for the production or the collection of products which such private individuals, companies or associations utilise or in which they trade.   
2.  Where concessions exist containing provisions involving such forced or compulsory labour, such provisions shall be rescinded as soon as possible, in order to comply with Article 1 of this Convention.   

### Article  6  

Officials of the administration, even when they have the duty of encouraging the populations under their charge to engage in some form of labour, shall not put constraint upon the said populations or upon any individual members thereof to work for private individuals, companies or associations.  

### Article  7  

1.  Chiefs who do not exercise administrative functions shall not have recourse to forced or compulsory labour.   
2.  Chiefs who exercise administrative functions may, with the express permission of the competent authority, have recourse to forced or compulsory labour, subject to the provisions of Article 10 of this Convention.   
3.  Chiefs who are duly recognised and who do not receive adequate remuneration in other forms may have the enjoyment of personal services, subject to due regulation and provided that all necessary measures are taken to prevent abuses.   

### Article  8  

1.  The responsibility for every decision to have recourse to forced or compulsory labour shall rest with the highest civil authority in the territory concerned.   
2.  Nevertheless, that authority may delegate powers to the highest local authorities to exact forced or compulsory labour which does not involve the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence. That authority may also delegate, for such periods and subject to such conditions as may be laid down in the regulations provided for in Article 28 of this Convention, powers to the highest local authorities to exact forced or compulsory labour which involves the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence for the purpose of facilitating the movement of officials of the administration, when on duty, and for the transport of Government stores.   

### Article  9  

Except as otherwise provided for in Article 10 of this Convention, any authority competent to exact forced or compulsory labour shall, before deciding to have recourse to such labour, satisfy itself: 

(a) that the work to be done or the service to be rendered is of important direct interest for the community called upon to do the work or render the service;  

(b) that the work or service is of present or imminent necessity;  

(c) that it has been impossible to obtain voluntary labour for carrying out the work or rendering the service by the offer of rates of wages and conditions of labour not less favourable than those prevailing in the area concerned for similar work or service; and  

(d) that the work or service will not lay too heavy a burden upon the present population, having regard to the labour available and its capacity to undertake the work.    

### Article  10  

1.  Forced or compulsory labour exacted as a tax and forced or compulsory labour to which recourse is had for the execution of public works by chiefs who exercise administrative functions shall be progressively abolished.   
2.  Meanwhile, where forced or compulsory labour is exacted as a tax, and where recourse is had to forced or compulsory labour for the execution of public works by chiefs who exercise administrative functions, the authority concerned shall first satisfy itself: 

(a) that the work to be done or the service to be rendered is of important direct interest for the community called upon to do the work or render the service;  

(b) that the work or the service is of present or imminent necessity;  

(c) that the work or service will not lay too heavy a burden upon the present population, having regard to the labour available and its capacity to undertake the work;  

(d) that the work or service will not entail the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence;  

(e) that the execution of the work or the rendering of the service will be directed in accordance with the exigencies of religion, social life and agriculture.     

### Article  11  

1.  Only adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years may be called upon for forced or compulsory labour. Except in respect of the kinds of labour provided for in Article 10 of this Convention, the following limitations and conditions shall apply:

In fixing this proportion the competent authority shall take account of the density of the population, of its social and physical development, of the seasons, and of the work which must be done by the persons concerned on their own behalf in their locality, and, generally, shall have regard to the economic and social necessities of the normal life of the community concerned.   

### Article  12  

1.  The maximum period for which any person may be taken for forced or compulsory labour of all kinds in any one period of twelve months shall not exceed sixty days, including the time spent in going to and from the place of work.

### Article  13  

1.  The normal working hours of any person from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted shall be the same as those prevailing in the ease of voluntary labour, and the hours worked in excess of the normal working hours shall be remunerated at the rates prevailing in the case of overtime for voluntary labour.   
2.  A weekly day of rest shall be granted to all persons from whom forced or compulsory labour of any kind is exacted and this day shall coincide as far as possible with the day fixed by tradition or custom in the territories or regions concerned.   

### Article  14  

1.  With the exception of the forced or compulsory labour provided for in Article 10 of this Convention, forced or compulsory labour of all kinds shall be remunerated in cash at rates not less than those prevailing for similar kinds of work either in the district in which the labour is employed or in the district from which the labour is recruited, whichever may be the higher.   
2.  In the case of labour to which recourse is had by chiefs in the exercise of their administrative functions, payment of wages in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be introduced as soon as possible.

4.  For the purpose of payment of wages the days spent in travelling to and from the place of work shall be counted as working days.   
5.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent ordinary rations being given as a part of wages, such rations to be at least equivalent in value to the money payment they are taken to represent, but deductions from wages shall not be made either for the payment or taxes or for special food, clothing or accommodation, supplied to a worker for the purpose of maintaining him in a fit condition to carry on his work under the special conditions of any employment, or for the supply of tools.   

### Article  15  

1.  Any laws or regulations relating to workmen's compensation for accidents or sickness arising out of the employment of the worker and any laws or regulations providing compensation for the dependants of deceased or incapacitated workers which are or shall be in force in the territory concerned shall be equally applicable to persons from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted and to voluntary workers.   
2.  In any case it shall be an obligation on any authority employing any worker on forced or compulsory labour to ensure the subsistence of any such worker who, by accident or sickness arising out of his employment, is rendered wholly or partially incapable of providing for himself, and to take measures to ensure the maintenance of any persons actually dependent upon such a worker in the event of his incapacity or decease arising out of his employment.   

### Article  16  

1.  Except in cases of special necessity, persons from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted shall not be transferred to districts where the food and climate differ so considerably from those to which they have been accustomed as to endanger their health.   
2.  In no case shall the transfer of such workers be permitted unless all measures relating to hygiene and accommodation which are necessary to adapt such workers to the conditions and to safeguard their health can be strictly applied.   
3.  When such transfer cannot be avoided, measures of gradual habituation to the new conditions of diet and of climate shall be adopted on competent medical advice.   
4.  In cases where such workers are required to perform regular work to which they are not accustomed, measures shall be taken to ensure their habituation to it, especially as regards progressive draining, the hours of work and the provision of rest intervals, and any increase or amelioration of diet which may be necessary.   

### Article  17  

Before permitting recourse to forced or compulsory labour for works of construction or maintenance which entail the workers remaining at the workplaces for considerable periods, the competent authority shall satisfy itself: 

(1) that all necessary measures are taken to safeguard the health of the workers and to guarantee the necessary medical care and, in particular, (*a*) that the workers are medically examined before commencing the work and at fixed intervals during the period of service, (*b*) that there is an adequate medical staff, provided with the dispensaries, infirmaries, hospitals and equipment necessary to meet all requirements, and (*c*) that the sanitary conditions of the workplaces, the supply of drinking water, food, fuel, and cooking utensils, and, where necessary, of housing and clothing, are satisfactory;  

(2) that definite arrangements are made to ensure the subsistence of the families of the workers, in particular by facilitating the remittance, by a safe method, of part of the wages to the family, at the request, or with the consent of the workers;  

(3) that the journeys of the workers to and from the workplaces are made at the expense and under the responsibility of the administration, which shall facilitate such journeys by making the fullest use of all available means of transport;  

(4) that in case of illness or accident causing incapacity to work of a certain duration, the worker is repatriated at the expense of the administration;  

(5) that any worker who may wish to remain as a voluntary worker at the end of his period of forced or compulsory labour is permitted to do so without, for a period of two years, losing his right to repatriation free of expense to himself.    

### Article  18  

1.  Forced or compulsory labour for the transport of persons or goods, such as the labour of porters or boatmen, shall be abolished within the shortest possible period. Meanwhile the competent authority shall promulgate regulations determining, *inter alia*, (*a*) that such labour shall only be employed for the purpose of facilitating the movement of officials of the administration, when on duty, or for the transport of Government stores, or in cases of very urgent necessity, the transport of persons other than officials, (*b*) that the workers so employed shall be medically certified to be physically fit, where medical examination is possible, and that where such medical examination is not practicable the person employing such workers shall be held responsible for ensuring that they are physically fit and not suffering from any infectious or contagious disease, (*c*) the maximum load which these workers may carry, (*d*) the maximum distance from their homes to which they may be taken, (*e*) the maximum number of days per month or other period for which they may be taken, including the days spent in returning to their homes, and (*f*) the persons entitled to demand this form of forced or compulsory labour and the extent to which they are entitled to demand it.   
2.  In fixing the maxima referred to under (*c*), (*d*) and (*e*) in the foregoing paragraph, the competent authority shall have regard to all relevant factors, including the physical development of the population from which the workers are recruited, the nature of the country through which they must travel and the climatic conditions.   
3.  The competent authority shall further provide that the normal daily journey of such workers shall not exceed a distance corresponding to an average working day of eight hours, it being understood that account shall be taken not only of the weight to be carried and the distance to be covered, but also of the nature of the road, the season and all other relevant factors, and that, where hours of journey in excess of the normal daily journey are exacted, they shall be remunerated at rates higher than the normal rates.   

### Article  19  

1.  The competent authority shall only authorise recourse to compulsory cultivation as a method of precaution against famine or a deficiency of food supplies and always under the condition that the food or produce shall remain the property of the individuals or the community producing it.   
2.  Nothing in this Article shall be construed as abrogating the obligation on members of a community, where production is organised on a communal basis by virtue of law or custom and where the produce or any profit accruing from the sale thereof remain the property of the community, to perform the work demanded by the community by virtue of law or custom.   

### Article  20  

Collective punishment laws under which a community may be punished for crimes committed by any of its members shall not contain provisions for forced or compulsory labour by the community as one of the methods of punishment.

Forced or compulsory labour shall not be used for work underground in mines.

### Article  23  

1.  To give effect to the provisions of this Convention the competent authority shall issue complete and precise regulations governing the use of forced or compulsory labour.   
2.  These regulations shall contain, *inter alia*, rules permitting any person from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted to forward all complaints relative to the conditions of labour to the authorities and ensuring that such complaints will be examined and taken into consideration.   

### Article  24  

Adequate measures shall in all cases be taken to ensure that the regulations governing the employment of forced or compulsory labour are strictly applied, either by extending the duties of any existing labour inspectorate which has been established for the inspection of voluntary labour to cover the inspection of forced or compulsory labour or in some other appropriate manner. Measures shall also be taken to ensure that the regulations are brought to the knowledge of persons from whom such labour is exacted.  

### Article  25  

The illegal exaction of forced or compulsory labour shall be punishable as a penal offence, and it shall be an obligation on any Member ratifying this Convention to ensure that the penalties imposed by law are really adequate and are strictly enforced.  

### Article  26  

1.  Each Member or the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to apply it to the territories placed under its sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection, suzerainty, tutelage or authority, so far as it has the right to accept obligations affecting matters of internal jurisdiction; provided that if such Member may desire to take advantage of the provisions of Article 35 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, it shall append to its ratification a declaration stating:

3.  Na verloop van een termijn van vijf jaar na het in werking treden van dit verdrag zal de Raad van Beheer van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau bij het gereedmaken van het rapport, bedoeld in artikel 31, onderzoeken, of het mogelijk is, den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid in al zijn vormen zonder nieuwen termijn af te schaffen en beslissen, of er aanleiding bestaat, dat vraagstuk op de agenda van de Conferentie te plaatsen.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit verdrag duidt de uitdrukking „gedwongen of verplichte arbeid” aan: elken arbeid of dienst, welke van een persoon wordt gevorderd onder bedreiging met een of andere straf en waarvoor bedoelde persoon zich niet vrijwillig heeft aangeboden.

### Artikel  3  

Voor de toepassing van dit verdrag duidt de uitdrukking „bevoegde autoriteiten” aan, hetzij de autoriteiten van het moederland, hetzij de hoogste centrale autoriteiten van het betrokken gebied.  

### Artikel  4  

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten mogen den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid niet opleggen of laten opleggen ten behoeve van particulieren, vennootschappen of private rechtspersonen.

### Artikel  5  

1.  Een concessie verleend aan particulieren, aan vennootschappen of private rechtspersonen zal niet ten gevolge mogen hebben, dat gedwongen of verplichte arbeid, in welken vorm ook, opgelegd wordt ten einde de producten voort te brengen of te verzamelen, welke die particulieren, vennootschappen of private rechtspersonen gebruiken of waarin zij handel drijven.   
2.  Wanneer bestaande concessies bepalingen bevatten, die ten gevolge hebben, dat een dergelijke vorm van gedwongen of verplichten arbeid wordt opgelegd, moeten die bepalingen zoo spoedig mogelijk buiten werking worden gesteld, ten einde aan het bepaalde in artikel 1 van dit verdrag te voldoen.   

### Artikel  6  

De ambtenaren der administratie zullen, zelfs wanneer zij de bevolking, waarover zij zijn aangesteld, moeten opwekken om eenigen vorm van arbeid, welken ook, te verrichten, geen dwang op die bevolking of op de individueele leden van die bevolking mogen oefenen, ten einde haar voor particulieren, vennootschappen of private rechtspersonen te laten werken.  

### Artikel  7

2.  Echter zullen die autoriteiten aan de hoogste plaatselijke autoriteiten het recht om den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid op te leggen kunnen delegeeren, in de gevallen, waarin die arbeid niet meebrengt, dat de arbeiders verwijderd worden van hun gewone verblijfplaats. Die autoriteiten zullen voor de tijdvakken en onder de voorwaarden, vastgesteld bij de regeling bedoeld in artikel 23 van dit verdrag, aan de hoogste plaatselijke autoriteiten eveneens het recht kunnen delegeeren om gedwongen of verplichten arbeid op te leggen voor de uitvoering waarvan de arbeiders zich moeten verwijderen van hun gewone verblijfplaats, indien dit geschiedt ter vergemakkelijking van het zich verplaatsen van ambtenaren van de administratie in de uitoefening van hun functies of van het vervoer van het materiaal van de administratie.   

### Artikel  9  

Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel 10 van dit verdrag, zal de autoriteit, die het recht heeft om gedwongen of verplichten arbeid op te leggen, het vorderen van den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid slechts mogen toestaan, indien zij zich er van te voren van verzekerd heeft:

2.  In afwachting van die afschaffing zullen, wanneer de gedwongen of verplichte arbeid gevorderd wordt bij wijze van belasting en wanneer de gedwongen of verplichte arbeid opgelegd wordt voor de uitvoering van werken van openbaar belang, door hoofden die administratieve functies uitoefenen, de betrokken autoriteiten zich er eerst van moeten overtuigen: 

a. dat de dienst of arbeid, welke uitgevoerd moet worden, van direct en groot belang is voor de gemeenschap, waarop voor uitvoering een beroep wordt gedaan;  

b. dat die dienst of arbeid dadelijk of zeer spoedig noodig is;

Behalve ten aanzien van de soorten arbeid, bedoeld in artikel 10 van dit verdrag, zullen de volgende beperkingen en voorwaarden in acht genomen moeten worden: 

a. vooraf moet in alle gevallen, waarin dat mogelijk is, door een geneesheer, aangewezen door de administratie, vastgesteld zijn, dat de betrokken personen niet lijden aan eenige besmettelijke ziekte en physiek geschikt zijn om den opgelegden arbeid onder de voorwaarden, waaronder die zal worden uitgevoerd, te verdragen;

2.  Met het oog op het bepaalde, onder *c.* hiervoren genoemd, zal de regeling, bedoeld in artikel 23 van dit verdrag, het gedeelte van de aanwezige mannelijke gezonde bevolking vaststellen, van wie in een bepaald geval gedwongen arbeid gevorderd kan worden, met dien verstande, dat dit gedeelte in geen geval meer dan 25 pct. van die bevolking zal mogen bedragen. Bij het vaststellen van dat gedeelte zullen de bevoegde autoriteiten rekening moeten houden met de dichtheid van de bevolking, hare sociale en physieke ontwikkeling, den tijd van het jaar en de werkzamheden, die door belanghebbenden ter plaatste en voor hun eigen rekening verricht moeten worden; in het algemeen zullen zij de economische en sociale behoefte van het normale leven van de betrokken gemeenschap moeten eerbiedigen.   

### Artikel  12  

1.  De maximumduur van den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid in zijn verschillende vormen, welke aan iemand opgelegd zal kunnen worden, zal niet meer mogen bedragen dan 60 dagen in een tijdvak van 12 maanden met dien verstande, dat de reisdagen, noodig om naar de plaats, waar gewerkt wordt, te gaan en daarvan terug te keeren, in die 60 dagen moeten zijn begrepen.

### Artikel  13  

1.  De normale arbeidsduur van elken persoon, van wien gedwongen of verplichten arbeid wordt gevorderd, moet dezelfde zijn als die, welke gebruikelijk is voor den vrijen arbeid; voor de uren, waarop boven den normalen duur gewerkt wordt, zal een vergoeding gegeven moeten worden tegen een loonschaal, welke in gebruik is voor de overuren van vrije arbeiders.   
2.  Een wekelijksche rustdag zal gegeven moeten worden aan alle personen, onderworpen aan gedwongen of verplichten arbeid van welken aard ook; die dag zal zooveel mogelijk moeten samenvallen met den dag door de overlevering of de gewoonten van het land of van de streek daarvoor bestemd.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Met uitzondering van den arbeid, bedoeld in artikel 10 van dit verdrag, zal de gedwongen of verplichte arbeid in al zijn vormen in geld beloond moet worden volgens een loonschaal, die niet lager mag zijn dan die, welke voor dezelfde soort arbeid van kracht is, hetzij in de streek waar de arbeiders gebruikt worden, hetzij in de streek, waaruit zij opgeroepen zijn.   
2.  In geval van gedwongen arbeid, gevorderd door hoofden in de uitoefening van hun administratieve functies, zal zoo spoedig mogelijk tot betaling van loon op de voorwaarden, als bedoeld in het vorig lid, moeten worden overgegaan.   
3.  De loonen moeten betaald worden aan elken arbeider afzonderlijk en niet aan het hoofd zijner gemeenschap of andere autoriteiten.   
4.  De reisdagen, om naar de plaats waar gewerkt wordt te gaan en om daarvan terug te keeren, zullen voor de loonbetaling gerekend moeten worden als arbeidsdagen.   
5.  Dit artikel verbiedt niet aan de arbeiders het gewone voedselrantsoen als deel van het loon te geven, welke rantsoenen ten minste gelijkwaardig moeten zijn aan de som gelds, welke zij geacht worden te vertegenwoordigen; van het loon zal echter niets mogen worden afgehouden, noch voor belastingen, noch voor bijzonder voedsel, bijzondere kleeding en woning, welke aan de arbeiders verschaft worden om hen, gelet op de bijzondere omstandigheden van hun werk, in staat te houden hun arbeid voort te zetten, noch voor het verschaffen van gereedschappen.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Elke wettelijke regeling betreffende de schadeloosstelling voor ongevallen of ziekten, ontstaan ten gevolge van den arbeid en elke wettelijke regeling, welke voorziet in de schadeloosstelling van personen, die ten laste van overleden of invalide arbeiders waren, welke van kracht is of zal zijn in het betrokken gebied, zal op dezelfde voorwaarden op personen, onderworpen aan gedwongen of verplichten arbeid van toepassing moeten zijn als op de vrije arbeiders.   
2.  In elk geval zal de bevoegde autoriteit, die een arbeider gebruikt voor gedwongen of verplichten arbeid, verplicht moeten zijn het onderhoud van bedoelden arbeider te verzekeren, wanneer een ongeval of een ziekte, welke het gevolg is van zijn arbeid, hem geheel of gedeeltelijk ongeschikt maakt om in zijn behoeften te voorzien. Die autoriteit zal eveneens de verplichting hebben maatregelen te nemen om, wanneer de arbeider ongeschikt tot werken wordt of overlijdt ten gevolge van zijn werk, het onderhoud te verzekeren van elke persoon, die daadwerkelijk ten laste van dien arbeider was.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  De personen, onderworpen aan gedwongen of verplichten arbeid, zullen, behalve in gevallen van buitengewone noodzaak, niet verplaatst mogen worden naar streken, waar de voeding en het klimaat in die mate verschillen van voeding en klimaat, waaraan zij gewoon zijn, dat zij een gevaar voor hun gezondheid opleveren.   
2.  In geen geval zal voor een dergelijk verplaatsten van arbeiders vergunning verleend mogen worden, indien niet alle de gezondheid en de woongelegenheid betreffende maatregelen, welke noodig zijn voor hun vestiging en voor het behoud van hun gezondheid, strikt toegepast zijn.   
3.  Wanneer een verplaatsen, als hier bedoeld, niet te vermijden is, zullen na advies van den bevoegden medischen dienst maatregelen genomen moeten worden, welke waarborgen, dat de arbeiders zich langzamerhand aanpassen aan de nieuwe voeding en het klimaat.   
4.  In de gevallen, waarin die arbeiders geroepen worden tot geregelden arbeid, waaraan zij niet gewoon zijn, zullen maatregelen genomen moeten worden om hun aanpassing aan dat soort arbeid te verzekeren, in het bijzonder voor zooveel betreft de geleidelijke oefening, arbeidsuren, het in acht nemen van tusschentijdse rustpoozen en de verbetering of vergrooting van de rantsoenen voedsel, die noodig mochten zijn.   

### Artikel  17  

Alvorens vergunning te verleenen tot het vorderen van gedwongen of verplichten arbeid voor bouw- of onderhoudswerken, welke de arbeiders verplichten om gedurende een langeren tijd te verblijven op de plaatsen van tewerkstelling, zullen de bevoegde autoriteiten er zich van moeten verzekeren:

c. de goede hygiëne op de plaatsen van tewerkstelling, het geregeld voorzien van de arbeiders van water, levensmiddelen, brandstoffen en kookgerei op voldoende wijze verzekerd is en dat, in geval het noodig is, voor voldoende kleeren en huisvesting gezorgd is;    

2. dat de juiste maatregelen genomen zijn om het levensonderhoud van de familie van den arbeider te verzekeren, in het bijzonder door gemakkelijk te maken, dat een deel van het loon, met toestemming of op verzoek van dien arbeider, op een veilige manier aan de familie van dien arbeider gezonden wordt;  

3. dat de reizen van de arbeiders om naar de plaatsen, waar gewerkt wordt, te gaan en daarvandaan terug te keeren, door de administratie onder hare verantwoordelijkheid en op haar kosten verzekerd zullen zijn en dat de administratie die reizen zal vergemakkelijken door op zoo ruim mogelijke schaal van alle beschikbare transportmiddelen gebruik te maken;  

4. dat in geval van ziekte of ongeval, welke een arbeidsongeschiktheid van eenigen duur met zich brengt, de repatrieering van den arbeider op kosten van de administratie verzekerd is;  

5. dat iedere arbeider, die, na afloop van zijn periode van gedwongen of verplichten arbeid ter plaatse als vrijwillig arbeider zou willen blijven, daartoe de bevoegdheid heeft, zonder gedurende een tijdvak van twee jaar zijn rechten op kosteloos vervoer naar huis te verliezen.    

### Artikel  18  

1.  De gedwongen of verplichte arbeid voor het vervoer van personen of goederen, b.v. het dragen en het pagaaien, zal binnen de kortst mogelijken termijn afgeschaft moeten worden en, in afwachting van die afschaffing, zullen de bevoegde autoriteiten reglementen moeten vaststellen, in het bijzonder regelende: 

a. de verplichting, dien arbeid slechts te gebruiken om het verplaatsen van ambtenaren der administratie in de uitoefening hunner functies of het vervoer van materieel van de administratie of, in geval van absoluut dringende noodzaak, het vervoer van andere personen dan ambtenaren te vergemakkelijken;  

b. de verplichting om voor dat vervoer slechts personen te gebruiken, die daartoe na een geneeskundige keuring, in alle gevallen, waarin die mogelijk is, physiek geschikt geoordeeld zijn; in de gevallen, waarin die keuring niet mogelijk is, moet de persoon, die zich van die arbeidskracht bedient, zich op verantwoordelijkheid er van verzekeren, dat de gebruikte arbeiders de vereischte physieke geschiktheid bezitten en niet aan een besmettelijke ziekte lijden;  

c. het maximum te dragen gewicht;  

d. de maximum afstand van hun verblijfplaats, die van arbeiders gevorderd mag worden;  

e. het maximum aantal dagen per maand of over een ander tijdvak, waarvoor zij opgeroepen kunnen worden, daaronder begrepen de dagen voor de terugreis;

2.  Bij het vaststellen van de maxima, waarvan sprake is onder de letters *c, d* en *e* van het vorig lid, zullen de bevoegde autoriteiten met de verschillende elementen, die daarvoor in aanmerking komen, rekening moeten houden, in het bijzonder met de physieke geschiktheid van de bevolking van wie die arbeid gevorderd wordt, de gesteldheid van den weg, waarover het vervoer plaats moet hebben en de klimaatsomstandigheden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten zullen bovendien er voor moeten waken, dat de normale, dagelijks door de dragers af te leggen afstand niet meer bedraagt dan een afstand overeenkomende met een gemiddelden arbeidsduur van acht uur, met dien verstande, dat, om die te bepalen, niet alleen rekening gehouden moet worden met den te dragen last en den af te leggen afstand, maar ook met den toestand van den weg, den tijd van het jaar en alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende factoren; indien het noodig is om aan de dragers overuren op te leggen, moeten daarvoor loonen gegeven worden, die hooger zijn dan de normale loonen.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten zullen vergunning om tot gedwongen cultures over te gaan, alleen mogen verleenen om hongersnood of schaarschte van levensmiddelen te voorkomen, steeds onder het voorbehoud, dat de aldus verkregen waren of producten het eigendom blijven van de personen of de gemeenschap, die ze heeft voortgebracht.   
2.  Dit artikel zal niet tot gevolg mogen hebben, dat, wanneer de productie volgens de wet en het gebruik ingericht is op gemeentelijken grondslag en wanneer de producten of de voordeelen, welke de verkoop van die producten oplevert, het eigendom van de gemeenschap blijven, voor de leden van de gemeenschap de verplichting afgeschaft wordt, om zich van den aldus opgelegden arbeid te kwijten.   

### Artikel  20  

Wettelijke regelingen, betreffende collectieve strafoplegging, krachtens welke een geheele gemeenschap gestraft kan worden voor de misdrijven, begaan door eenige van haar leden, zullen den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid door een gemeenschap niet als een der methoden van straf mogen bevatten.

### Artikel  24  

Passende maatregelen zullen in alle gevallen genomen moeten worden om de stipte toepassing te verzekeren van de reglementen, betrekking hebbende op het gebruik van den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid, hetzij door de bevoegdheden van elke inspectie, die reeds ingesteld is om toezicht te houden op den vrijen arbeid, uit te breiden tot den gedwongen of verplichten arbeid, hetzij door eenig ander passend systeem.
