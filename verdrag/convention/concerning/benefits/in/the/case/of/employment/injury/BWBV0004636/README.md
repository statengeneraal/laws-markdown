### Artikel  2  

1.  Een Lid dat op economisch en medisch gebied nog onvoldoende is ontwikkeld kan zich, door een bij zijn akte van bekrachtiging gevoegde gemotiveerde verklaring, het recht voorbehouden tot tijdelijke toepassing van de afwijkende bepalingen voorkomende in de volgende artikelen: 5, 9, lid 3, alinea *b)*, 12, 15, lid 2 en 18, lid 3.

a) zeevarenden, met inbegrip van zeevissers,  

b) overheidsdienaren,   wanneer deze categorieën worden beschermd door speciale regelingen welke voorzien in prestaties die in totaal tenminste gelijkwaardig zijn aan die van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Wanneer een ingevolge het vorige lid afgelegde verklaring van kracht is, kan het Lid de in die verklaring bedoelde personen uitzonderen van het aantal loontrekkenden dat voor de berekening van het percentage loontrekkenden, bedoeld in artikel 4, tweede lid, alinea *d)* en artikel 5, in aanmerking wordt genomen.   
3.  Elk Lid dat een verklaring ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel heeft afgelegd kan later aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau kennisgeven dat het de verplichtingen van dit Verdrag aanvaardt ten aanzien van de categorie of categorieën personen die het bij zijn bekrachtiging heeft uitgesloten.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  De nationale wetgeving inzake prestaties bij arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten moet bescherming bieden aan alle loontrekkenden (met inbegrip van de leerlingen) werkzaam in het bedrijfsleven en in de overheidssector, met inbegrip van de coöperaties, en in geval van overlijden van de kostwinner aan de voorgeschreven categorieën rechthebbenden.

### Artikel  5  

Wanneer een ingevolge artikel 2 afgelegde verklaring van kracht is, kan de toepassing van de nationale wetgeving inzake prestaties bij arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten worden beperkt tot voorgeschreven categorieën loontrekkenden, welke in totaal tenminste 75 procent van het totale aantal loontrekkenden in de industriële inrichtingen omvatten, en in geval van overlijden van de kostwinner tot voorgeschreven categorieën rechthebbenden.  

### Artikel  6  

Onder de door verzekering gedekte gevallen moeten de volgende worden begrepen, wanneer deze het gevolg zijn van een arbeidsongeval of van een beroepsziekte: 

a) ziektetoestand;  

b) ongeschiktheid tot werken welke voortspruit uit een ziektetoestand en welke derving van inkomsten uit arbeid met zich brengt, zoals nader geregeld bij de nationale wetgeving;  

c) algeheel verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven of gedeeltelijk verlies van zodanige geschiktheid, uitgaande boven een voorgeschreven minimum, wanneer het waarschijnlijk is dat dit gehele of gedeeltelijke verlies blijvend zal zijn, alsmede overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid;  

d) verlies van middelen van bestaan, ten gevolge van het overen van de kostwinner, door voorgeschreven categorieën rechthebbenden.    

### Artikel  7  

1.  Elk Lid dient een definitie van „arbeidsongeval” voor te schrijven, waarin tevens de voorwaarden worden opgenomen waaronder een ongeval dat op weg van of naar het werk heeft plaatsgevonden, als arbeidsongeval wordt aangemerkt, en in de rapporten over de toepassing van dit Verdrag die het krachtens artikel 22 van het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie moet uitbrengen, deze definitie weer te geven en toe te lichten.   
2.  Indien de ongevallen die plaatsvinden op weg van en naar het werk, reeds gedekt worden door andere regelingen van de Sociale Zekerheid dan die met betrekking tot de schadeloosstelling van arbeidsongevallen en die regelingen bij ongevallen op weg van en naar het werk in prestaties voorzien, welke in totaal tenminste gelijkwaardig zijn aan die waarin dit Verdrag voorziet, behoeft van het ongeval op weg van en naar het werk geen gewag te worden gemaakt in het kader van de definitie van „arbeidsongeval”.   

### Artikel  8  

Elk Lid moet 

a) bij de wet een lijst van ziekten vaststellen, welke tenminste de ziekten bevat, die in de bij dit Verdrag gevoegde Tabel I zijn genoemd en die onder voorwaarden als voorgeschreven, als beroepsziekten worden erkend, of  

b) in zijn wetgeving een algemene definitie van beroepsziekten opnemen, welke voldoende ruim is om tenminste de ziekten welke in de bij dit Verdrag genoemde Tabel I zijn genoemd, te dekken, of  

c) bij de wet een lijst van ziekten vaststellen overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder *a),* aangevuld door een algemene definitie van beroepsziekten, of door bepalingen welke het mogelijk maken vast te stellen of andere dan in de lijst genoemde ziekten of ziekten die zich niet onder de voorwaarden als voorgeschreven openbaren in het beroep zijn ontstaan.

3.  De prestaties moeten worden verleend tijdens de gehele duur van het door verzekering gedekte geval. De uitkering bij arbeidsongeschiktheid behoeft echter niet te worden verleend over de eerste drie dagen: 

a) wanneer in de wetgeving van een lid op de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag een carenstijd is voorzien, mits het Lid in de rapporten over de toepassing van dit Verdrag die het krachtens artikel 22 van het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie moet uitbrengen vermeldt dat de redenen voor de toepassing van deze afwijkende bepaling nog bestaan;  

b) wanneer een overeenkomstig artikel 2 afgelegde verklaring van kracht is.

### Artikel  11  

1.  Elk Lid dat de geneeskundige zorg en de daaraan verbonden diensten verleent door middel van een algemene gezondheidsregeling of een regeling voor geneeskundige zorg voor loontrekkenden kan in zijn wetgeving bepalen dat deze zorg aan hen die getroffen zijn door een arbeidsongeval of een beroepsziekte, onder dezelfde voorwaarden wordt verleend als aan andere rechthebbenden, mits de desbetreffende bepalingen zodanig zijn gesteld, dat de betrokkenen niet in behoeftige omstandigheden geraken.   
2.  Elk Lid dat de geneeskundige zorg en de daaraan verbonden diensten verleent in de vorm van terugbetaling van door de getroffene gedane uitgaven kan in zijn wetgeving bijzondere bepalingen opnemen voor gevallen waarin de omvang, duur of de kosten van deze zorg redelijke grenzen overschrijden, mits deze bepalingen niet in tegenspraak zijn met de doeleinden vermeld in artikel 10, tweede lid, en zodanig gesteld zijn, dat de betrokkenen niet in behoeftige omstandigheden geraken.

Ingeval van tijdelijke of beginnende arbeidsongeschiktheid bestaat de uitkering in een periodieke betaling, berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 19 of artikel 20.  

### Artikel  14  

1.  Ingeval van verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven, wanneer dit verlies waarschijnlijk blijvend zal zijn, of van overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid, worden de uitkeringen verleend in alle gevallen waarin dit verlies of deze vermindering een voorgeschreven graad overschrijdt en na afloop van het tijdvak gedurende hetwelk uitkeringen overeenkomstig artikel 13 verschuldigd zijn nog voortduurt.   
2.  Ingeval van algeheel verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven, wanneer dit verlies waarschijnlijk blijvend zal zijn, of ingeval van een overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid, bestaat de uitkering in een periodieke betaling, berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 19 of artikel 20.   
3.  Ingeval van een aanmerkelijk gedeeltelijk verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven, boven een voorgeschreven graad, indien dit verlies waarschijnlijk blijvend zal zijn, of ingeval van een overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid, bestaat de uitkering in een periodieke betaling, in een billijke verhouding staande tot die bedoeld in lid 2 van dit artikel.   
4.  Ingeval van een niet aanmerkelijk gedeeltelijk verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven, doch boven de voorgeschreven graad bedoeld in lid 1, wanneer dit verlies waarschijnlijk blijvend zal zijn of ingeval van overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid, kan de uitkering geschieden in de vorm van een betaling ineens.   
5.  De graden van verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven of van de overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichaamsgesteldheid bedoeld in de leden 1 en 3 van dit artikel, worden door de nationale wetgeving zodanig vastgesteld, dat de betrokkenen niet in behoeftige omstandigheden geraken.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  In bijzondere omstandigheden kan met goedvinden van de getroffene de periodieke betaling bedoeld in de leden 2 en 3 van artikel 14, geheel of ten dele, worden omgezet in een uitkering ineens welke overeenkomt met de contante waarde van die periodieke betaling, indien de bevoegde autoriteit redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat een zodanige uitkering ineens pp een voor de getroffene bijzonder gunstige wijze zal worden aangewend.   
2.  Indien een overeenkomstig artikel 2 afgelegde verklaring van kracht is en het Lid meent niet over voldoende administratieve middelen te beschikken om een regelmatige betaalbaarstelling van de periodieke betalingen te verzekeren, kan het in de leden 2 en 3 van artikel 14 bedoelde periodieke betalingen omzetten in een uitkering ineens, overeenkomende met hun contante waarde berekend op basis van de bestaande gegevens.   

### Artikel  16  

Voor getroffenen die in een toestand verkeren, welke geregeld oppassing en verzorging door een derde nodig maakt, moet worden voorzien in verhogingen van de periodieke betalingen of andere bijzondere of aanvullende uitkeringen, naar gelang wordt voorgeschreven.  

### Artikel  17  

De nationale wetgeving bepaalt de voorwaarde waaronder herziening, schorsing of intrekking van de periodieke uitkeringen terzake van verlies van de geschiktheid om inkomsten uit arbeid te verwerven of van een overeenkomstige vermindering van de lichamelijke gesteldheid zal plaatsvinden in verband met de wijzigingen welke in de mate van dit verlies of deze vermindering kunnen optreden.  

### Artikel  18  

1.  Ingeval van overlijden van de kostwinner bestaat de uitkering aan een weduwe als voorgeschreven, aan de invalide en ten laste komende weduwnaar, aan de ten laste komende kinderen van de overledene en aan alle andere eventueel door deze nationale wetgeving aangewezen personen, in een periodieke betaling, berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 19 of 20. Aan de invalide en ten laste komende weduwnaar behoeft echter geen uitkering te worden verleend, wanneer de uitkeringen aan de andere nagelaten betrekkingen die voorzien bij dit Verdrag aanmerkelijk te boven gaan en andere regelingen inzake Sociale Zekerheid aan een zodanige weduwnaar uitkeringen toekennen, welke aanmerkelijk hoger liggen dan die welke ter zake van invaliditeit bij het Verdrag inzake Sociale Zekerheid (minimumnormen) 1952 zijn voorzien.   
2.  Daarenboven wordt een uitkering verleend voor de kosten van lijkbezorging tot een voorgeschreven bedrag, hetwelk niet lager ligt dan de normale kosten van lijkbezorging; het recht op deze uitkering kan echter afhankelijk worden gesteld van voorgeschreven voorwaarden, indien de uitkeringen aan nagelaten betrekkingen die voorzien bij dit Verdrag aanmerkelijk te boven gaan.   
3.  Indien een overeenkomstig artikel 2 afgelegde verklaring van kracht is en het Lid meent niet over voldoende administratieve middelen te beschikken om een regelmatige betaalbaarstelling van de periodieke betalingen te verzekeren, kan het de in lid 1 van dit artikel bedoelde periodieke betalingen omzetten in een uitkering ineens, overeenkomende met hun contante waarde berekend op basis van de bestaande gegevens.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  Ten aanzien van elke periodieke uitkering waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens het door verzekering gedekte geval verstrekte kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn, dat het voor de modelgerechtigde bedoeld in de bij dit Verdrag gevoegde Tabel II, tenminste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor het onderhavige geval aangegeven percentage van het totaal van de vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner en van het bedrag van de kinderbijslag verstrekt aan een beschermd persoon die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als die modelgerechtigde.   
2.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner moeten overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regels worden berekend; wanneer de beschermde personen of hun kostwinners zijn ingedeeld in klassen naar hun inkomsten uit arbeid kunnen de vroegere inkomsten worden berekend naar het basisinkomen van de klasse waartoe de betrokkenen hebben behoord.   
3.  Het bedrag van de uitkering of het arbeidsinkomen dat als basis voor de berekening van de uitkering wordt genomen, kan aan een maximum worden gebonden, mits dit maximum zodanig wordt vastgesteld dat voldaan wordt aan de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel, wanneer het vroegere arbeidsinkomen van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner minder bedraagt dan of gelijk is aan dat van een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider.   
4.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner, het loon van de geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkering en de kinderbijslag zullen worden berekend naar dezelfde tijdbasis.   
5.  Voor de andere gerechtigden zullen de uitkeringen zodanig worden vastgesteld, dat zij in een redelijke verhouding staan tot die van de modelgerechtigde.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt als geschoolde mannelijke arbeider aangemerkt: 

a) een bankwerker of een draaier in de mechanische industrie, met uitzondering van de vervaardiging van elektrische appaten; of  

b) een geschoolde arbeider, zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid; of  

c) een persoon wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan of meer bedraagt dan het arbeidsinkomen van 75 procent van alle beschermde personen, waarbij dat arbeidsinkomen wordt bepaald over een tijdvak van een jaar of over een korter tijdvak, naar gelang zal worden voorgeschreven; of  

d) een persoon wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan 125 procent van het gemiddelde arbeidsinkomen van alle beschermde personen.     
7.  De geschoolde arbeider, zoals bedoeld in alinea *b)* van het vorige lid, wordt gekozen uit de klasse die het grootste aantal tegen het door verzekering gedekte geval beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen omvat, in de bedrijfstak die het grootste aantal van deze beschermde personen of van die kostwinners telt; daarbij moet gebruik worden gemaakt van de internationale industriële standaardclassificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 augustus 1948 en die inzijn herziene vorm als bijlage bij dit Verdrag is gevoegd, zulks met inachtneming van de wijzigingen welke daarin later eventueel worden aangebracht.   
8.  Wanneer de uitkeringen van streek tot streek verschillen kan voor elke streek een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 6 en 7 van dit artikel.   
9.  Het loon van een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van eventuele duurtetoeslagen, wordt bepaald naar de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het achtste lid van dit artikel niet wordt toegepast, wordt het gemiddelde loon ais grondslag genomen.   
10.  Geen enkele periodieke uitkering mag lager zijn dan het voorgeschreven minimumbedrag.   

### Artikel  20  

1.  Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling waarop dit artikel van toepassing is moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens het door verzekering gedekte geval verstrekte kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn dat het voor de modelgerechtigde, bedoeld in de bij dit Verdrag gevoegde Tabel II, tenminste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor het desbetreffende geval aangegeven percentage van het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de kinderbijslag, verleend aan een beschermd persoon die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als de modelgerechtigde.   
2.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkering en de kinderbijslag worden berekend naar dezelfde tijdbasis.   
3.  Voor de andere gerechtigden zullen de uitkeringen zodanig worden vastgesteld dat zij in een redelijke verhouding staan tot die van de modelgerechtigde.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt als ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider aangemerkt: 

a) een ongeschoolde arbeider in de mechanische industrie, met uitzondering van de vervaardiging van elektrische apparaten; of  

b) een ongeschoolde arbeider, zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid.     
5.  De ongeschoolde arbeider bedoeld in alinea *b)* van het vorige lid wordt gekozen uit de klasse die het grootste aantal tegen het door verzekering gedekte geval beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen omvat, in de bedrijfstak die het grootste aantal van deze personen of van die kostwinners telt; daarbij moet gebruik worden gemaakt van de internationale industriële standaardclassificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 augustus 1948 en die in zijn herziene vorm als bijlage bij dit Verdrag is gevoegd, zulks met inachtneming van de wijzigingen welke daarin later eventueel worden aangebracht.   
6.  Wanneer de uitkeringen van streek tot streek verschillen kan voor elke streek een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 4 en 5 van dit artikel.   
7.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van de eventuele duurtetoeslagen, wordt bepaald naaf de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het zesde lid van dit artikel niet wordt toegepast, wordt het gemiddelde loon als grondslag genomen.   
8.  Geen enkele periodieke betaling mag minder bedragen dan het Voorgeschreven minimumbedrag.   

### Artikel  21  

1.  De bedragen van de lopende periodieke betalingen bedoeld in de leden 2 en 3 van artikel 14 en in lid 1 van artikel 18, worden herzien bij aanmerkelijke veranderingen in het algemeen loonpeil welke het gevolg zijn van aanmerkelijke veranderingen in de kosten van levensonderhoud.   
2.  Elk Lid moet in de rapporten over de toepassing van dit Verdrag die het krachtens artikel 22 van het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie moet uitbrengen, de uit bovenbedoelde veranderingen getrokken conclusies vermelden en aangeven wat in dit opzicht is ondernomen.   

### Artikel  22  

1.  Een uitkering waarop een beschermd persoon op grond van dit Verdrag recht zou hebben gehad, kan worden geschorst tot op zulk een hoogte als wordt voorgeschreven: 

a) zolang de belanghebbende zich niet op het grondgebied van het Lid bevindt;  

b) zolang het onderhoud van de belanghebbende ten laste van de overheid of van een instelling of dienst van sociale zekerheid komt;  

c) wanneer de belanghebbende getracht heeft op bedrieglijke wijze de desbetreffende uitkering te verkrijgen;  

d) wanneer het arbeidsongeval of de beroepsziekte is veroorzaakt door een door de belanghebbende gepleegd misdrijf of gepleegde overtreding;  

e) wanner het arbeidsongeval of de beroepsziekte is veroorzaakt door vrijwillig innemen van giftige stoffen of door een ernstig en opzettelijk wangedrag van de belanghebbende;  

f) wanneer de belanghebbende zonder geldige reden nalaat gebruik te maken van de geneeskundige zorg en daarmee verbonden diensten, alsmede van de revalidatiediensten welke te zijner beschikking staan of indien hij de regels niet nakomt, welke zijn voorgeschreven voor het vaststellen van het bestaan van de gebeurtenis of voor de gedragingen van de gerechtigde;

### Artikel  23  

1.  Een ieder die aanspraak maakt op een uitkering moet het recht hebben om beroep in te stellen, wanneer hem een uitkering wordt geweigerd of wanneer hij zich niet kan verenigen met de hoedanigheid of de omvang daarvan.   
2.  Wanneer bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag de verstrekking van de geneeskundige zorg is toevertrouwd aan een departement van algemeen bestuur dat verantwoording schuldig is aan een volksvertegenwoordiging, kan het in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde recht van beroep worden vervangen door het recht om elk bezwaar tegen weigering van geneeskundige zorg of tegen de hoedanigheid der ontvangen geneeskundige zorg te doen onderzoeken door de bevoegde autoriteit.   
3.  Wanneer verzoeken worden behandeld door rechterlijke colleges welke speciaal zijn ingesteld voor de behandeling van zaken aangaande prestaties bij arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten of aangaande de sociale zekerheid in het algemeen en waarin de beschermde personen vertegenwoordigd zijn, behoeft het recht van beroep niet te worden toegekend.   

### Artikel  24  

1.  Wanneer het beheer niet wordt gevoerd door een op overheidsvoorschriften berustende instelling of door een departement van algemeen bestuur dat verantwoording schuldig is aan een volksvertegenwoordiging, moeten vertegenwoordigers van de beschermde personen deelnemen aan het beheer of met raadgevende stem daarbij betrokken worden onder voorgeschreven voorwaarden; de nationale wetgeving kan eveneens bepalingen bevatten inzake de deelneming van vertegenwoordigers van de werkgevers en van de overheid.   
2.  Het Lid moet algemene verantwoordelijkheid aanvaarden voor een goed beheer van de instellingen en diensten die betrokken zijn bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  25  

Elk Lid aanvaardt een algemene verantwoordelijkheid wat betreft het verlenen van de krachtens dit Verdrag toegekende prestaties en neemt alle hiertoe dienende maatregelen.  

### Artikel  26  

1.  Elk Lid moet onder voorgeschreven voorwaarden: 

a) preventieve maatregelen nemen tegen arbeidsongevallen en beroepsziekten;  

b) voorzien in revalidatiediensten die in alle gevallen waarin dit mogelijk is de invalide een opleiding geven, die het hem mogelijk zal maken zijn vroegere arbeid te hervatten of, indien dit mogelijk is, andere lonende arbeid te verrichten, welke het best overeenkomt met zijn geschiktheid en bekwaamheid;  

c) maatregelen nemen om de plaatsing van invaliden in een geschikte werkkring te vergemakkelijken.     
2.  Elk Lid moet voor zover mogelijk in de rapporten over de toepassing van dit Verdrag die het krachtens artikel 22 van het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie moet uitbrengen, inlichtingen verstrekken met betrekking tot de veelvuldigheid en de ernst van de arbeidsongevallen.   

### Artikel  27

2.  Bekrachtiging van dit Verdrag door een Lid dat partij is bij het Verdrag (herzien) betreffende schadeloosstelling voor beroepsziekten, 1934, houdt overeenkomstig artikel 8 van dat Verdrag, ipso iure de opzegging daarvan in, wanneer dit Verdrag in werking is getreden. De inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag sluit echter de verdere bekrachtiging van het Verdrag (herzien) betreffende schadeloosstelling voor beroepsziekten, 1934, niet uit.   

### Artikel  29  

Overeenkomstig artikel 75 van het Verdrag betreffende de sociale zekerheid (minimumnormen), 1952, houden Deel VI en de overeenkomstige bepalingen van andere delen van genoemd Verdrag op van toepassing te zijn voor elk Lid dat dit Verdrag bekrachtigt, van de datum af waarop dit Verdrag voor het betrokken Lid in werking treedt. De aanvaarding van de verplichtingen van dit Verdrag wordt evenwel, voor de toepassing van artikel 2 van het Verdrag betreffende de sociale zekerheid (minimumnormen), 1952, beschouwd als zijnde een aanvaarding van de verplichtingen van Deel VI en de overeenkomstige bepalingen van de andere delen van genoemd Verdrag.  

### Artikel  30  

Wanneer zulks wordt bepaald in een later door de Conferentie aangenomen Verdrag, hetwelk betrekking heeft op een of meer van de in dit Verdrag behandelde onderwerpen, houden de bepalingen van dit Verdrag welke in het nieuwe Verdrag worden genoemd, op van toepassing te zijn op elk Lid dat dat laatste Verdrag heeft bekrachtigd, van de datum af waarop het voor het betrokken Lid in werking treedt.

2.  Deze wijzigingen worden voor de Leden die reeds partij zijn bij het Verdrag van kracht zodra zij aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau hebben medegedeeld dat zij deze aanvaarden.   
3.  Tenzij de Conferentie anders besluit bij de aanvaarding van zodanige wijzigingen, zijn deze als gevolg van hun aanvaarding door de Conferentie van kracht voor elk Lid, dat het Verdrag later bekrachtigt.   

### Artikel  32  

De formele bekrachtigingen van dit Verdrag dienen aan de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau te worden medegedeeld en door deze geregistreerd.  

### Artikel  33  

1.  Dit Verdrag is slechts verbindend voor de Leden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie die hun bekrachtiging door de Directeur-Generaal hebben doen registreren.

3.  Vervolgens treedt dit Verdrag voor ieder Lid in werking twaalf maanden na de datum waarop zijn bekrachtiging is geregistreerd.   

### Artikel  34  

1.  Elk Lid dat dit Verdrag heeft bekrachtigd, kan het opzeggen na verloop van een termijn van tien jaar na de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, door middel van een tot de Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau gerichte en door deze geregistreerde verklaring. De opzegging wordt eerst van kracht een jaar nadat zij is geregistreerd.   
2.  Elk Lid dat dit Verdrag heeft bekrachtigd en niet binnen een jaar na het verloop van de termijn van tien jaar als bedoeld in het vorige lid gebruik maakt van de bevoegdheid tot opzegging voorzien in dit artikel, is voor een nieuwe termijn van tien jaren gebonden en kan daarna dit Verdrag opzeggen na afloop van elke termijn van tien jaar onder de voorwaarden bedoeld in dit artikel.   

### Artikel  35  

1.  De Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau geeft aan alle Leden van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie kennis van de registratie van alle bekrachtigingen en opzeggingen die hem door de Leden der Organisatie zijn medegedeeld.   
2.  Bij de kennisgeving aan de Leden der Organisatie van de registratie van de tweede hem medegedeelde bekrachtiging, vestigt de Directeur-Generaal de aandacht van de Leden der Organisatie op de datum, waarop dit Verdrag van kracht wordt.   

### Artikel  36  

De Directeur-Generaal van het Internationaal Arbeidsbureau doet aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties mededeling, ter registratie overeenkomstig artikel 102 van het Handvest der Verenigde Naties, van de volledige bijzonderheden betreffende alle bekrachtigingen en opzeggingen, welke door hem overeenkomstig de voorgaande artikelen zijn geregistreerd.  

### Artikel  37  

Telkens wanneer de Raad van Beheer van het Internationale Arbeidsbureau zulks nodig oordeelt, brengt deze Raad aan de Algemene Conferentie verslag uit over de toepassing van dit Verdrag en onderzoekt of het wenselijk is de gehele of gedeeltelijke herziening ervan op de agenda der Conferentie te plaatsen.
