### Deel  V  

####Berekening van periodieke betalingen

### Artikel  26  

1.  Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens de eventualiteit verstrekte kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn dat het voor de model-gerechtigde, bedoeld in de bij dit deel gevoegde tabel, ten minste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor het onderhavige geval genoemde percentage van het totaal van de vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner en van het bedrag van de kinderbijslag, verstrekt aan een beschermde persoon die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als de model-gerechtigde.   
2.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner worden overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen berekend; wanneer de beschermde personen of hun kostwinners zijn ingedeeld in klassen naar hun inkomsten uit arbeid, kunnen deze vroegere inkomsten worden berekend naar het basisinkomen van de klasse waartoe zij hebben behoord.   
3.  Het bedrag van de uitkering of het arbeidsinkomen, dat voor de berekening van de uitkering in aanmerking wordt genomen, kan aan een maximum worden gebonden, mits dit maximum zodanig wordt vastgesteld dat voldaan wordt aan de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel, wanneer het vroegere arbeidsinkomen van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner minder bedraagt dan of gelijk is aan het loon van een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider.   
4.  De vroegere inkomsten uit arbeid van de gerechtigde of van zijn kostwinner, het loon van de geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkeringen en de kinderbijslag worden berekend naar dezelfde tijdsbasis.   
5.  Voor de andere gerechtigden wordt de uitkering zodanig vastgesteld dat deze in een redelijke verhouding staat tot die van de model-gerechtigde.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt als een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider aangemerkt: 

a. een bankwerker of een draaier in de bedrijfstak machinebouw, met uitzondering van die van elektrische apparaten; of  

b. een model-geschoolde arbeider, zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid; of  

c. een persoon wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan of meer bedraagt dan het arbeidsinkomen van 75 procent van alle beschermde personen, waarbij dat arbeidsinkomen wordt bepaald over een tijdvak van een jaar of over een korter tijdvak, naar gelang is voorgeschreven; of  

d. een persoon wiens arbeidsinkomen gelijk is aan 125 procent van het gemiddelde arbeidsinkomen van alle beschermde personen.     
7.  Voor de toepassing van alinea *b* van het voorgaande lid wordt de model-geschoolde arbeider gekozen uit de klasse met het grootste aantal tegen de betrokken eventualiteit beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen in de bedrijfstak die zelf het grootste aantal van deze beschermde personen of van die kostwinners telt; daartoe wordt gebruik gemaakt van de internationale industriële-standaard-classificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 augustus 1948 en in zijn in 1958 herziene vorm, als bijlage bij dit Verdrag gevoegd, met inachtneming van de wijzigingen welke daarin eventueel nog worden aangebracht.   
8.  Wanneer de uitkering van streek tot streek verschilt, kan voor elke streek een geschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 6 en 7 van dit artikel.   
9.  Het loon van de geschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van de eventuele duurtetoeslagen, wordt bepaald naar de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het voorgaande lid niet wordt toegepast, wordt het gemiddelde loon als grondslag genomen.   

### Artikel  27  

1.  Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling waarop dit artikel van toepassing is, moet het bedrag van de uitkering, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de tijdens de eventualiteit verleende kinderbijslag, zodanig zijn dat het voor de model-gerechtigde, bedoeld in de bij dit deel gevoegde tabel, ten minste gelijk is aan het in die tabel voor de desbetreffende eventualiteit aangegeven percentage van het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, vermeerderd met het bedrag van de kinderbijslag, verleend aan een beschermde persoon die dezelfde gezinslasten heeft als de model-gerechtigde.   
2.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, de uitkering en de kinderbijslag worden berekend naar dezelfde tijdsbasis.   
3.  Voor de andere gerechtigden wordt de uitkering zodanig vastgesteld dat deze in een redelijke verhouding staat tot die van de model-gerechtigde.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt als ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider aangemerkt: 

a. een ongeschoolde arbeider in de bedrijfstak machinebouw, met uitzondering van die van elektrische apparaten; of  

b. een ongeschoolde arbeider zoals omschreven in de bepalingen van het volgende lid.     
5.  Voor de toepassing van alinea *b* van het voorgaande lid wordt de ongeschoolde arbeider gekozen uit de klasse met het grootste aantal tegen de betrokken eventualiteit beschermde mannelijke personen of kostwinners van beschermde personen in de bedrijfstak die zelf het grootste aantal van deze beschermde personen of kostwinners telt; daartoe wordt gebruik gemaakt van de internationale industriële standaardclassificatie van alle takken van economische bedrijvigheid, aangenomen door de Economische en Sociale Raad van de Verenigde Naties in zijn zevende zitting op 27 augustus 1948 en in zijn in 1958 herziene vorm, als bijlage bij dit Verdrag gevoegd, met inachtneming van de wijzigingen welke daarin eventueel nog worden aangebracht.   
6.  Wanneer de uitkering van streek tot streek verschilt kan voor elke streek een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider worden gekozen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de leden 4 en 5 van dit artikel.   
7.  Het loon van een volwassen ongeschoolde mannelijke arbeider, met inbegrip van de eventuele duurtetoeslagen, wordt bepaald naar de grondslag van het loon voor een normaal aantal arbeidsuren, vastgesteld hetzij bij collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst, hetzij eventueel bij of krachtens de nationale wetgeving, hetzij krachtens gewoonte; wanneer de aldus vastgestelde lonen van streek tot streek verschillen en wanneer het voorgaande lid niet wordt toegepast, wordt het gemiddelde loon als grondslag genomen.   

### Artikel  28  

Ten aanzien van elke periodieke betaling waarop dit artikel van toepassing is: 

a. moet het bedrag van de uitkering worden vastgesteld naar een voorgeschreven tarief of naar een tarief, vastgesteld door het bevoegde overheidsorgaan, overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen;  

b. kan het bedrag van de uitkering slechts worden verminderd in de mate waarin de overige inkomsten van het gezin van de gerechtigde een voorgeschreven of door het bevoegde overheidsorgaan overeenkomstig voorgeschreven regelen vastgesteld aanzienlijk bedrag te boven gaan;  

c. moet, na aftrek van het in de vorige alinea bedoelde aanzienlijke bedrag, het totaal van de uitkering en de overige inkomsten voldoende zijn om aan het gezin van de gerechtigde gezonde en passende levensvoorwaarden te verzekeren; het mag niet minder bedragen dan het bedrag van de uitkering, berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 27;  

d. wordt aan het bepaalde in de voorgaande alinea geacht te zijn voldaan, indien het totaalbedrag van de krachtens het desbetreffende deel betaalde uitkeringen ten minste 30 procent meer bedraagt dan het totaalbedrag der uitkeringen dat men zou verkrijgen bij toepassing van de bepalingen van artikel 27 en de bepalingen van: 

i. alinea *b* van het eerste lid van artikel 9, wat betreft deel II;  

ii. alinea *b* van het eerste lid van artikel 16, wat betreft deel III;  

iii. alinea *b* van het eerste lid van artikel 22, wat betreft deel IV.      

### Artikel  29  

1.  Het bedrag van de lopende periodieke betalingen, bedoeld in de artikelen 10, 17 en 23, wordt herzien na aanmerkelijke veranderingen in het algemene loonpeil of na aanmerkelijke veranderingen in de kosten van levensonderhoud.   
2.  Elk Lid moet in de rapporten over de toepassing van dit Verdrag, die het krachtens artikel 22 van het Statuut van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie moet uitbrengen, de uit deze herzieningen voortvloeiende resultaten vermelden en aangeven wat in dit opzicht is ondernomen.
