### III  

####Vocational guidance

7. 

(1) Members should gradually extend their systems of vocational guidance, including continuing employment information, with a view to ensuring that comprehensive information and the broadest possible guidance are available to all children, young persons and adults, including appropriate programmes for all handicapped and disabled persons.  

(2) Such information and guidance should cover the choice of an occupation, vocational training and related educational opportunities, the employment situation and employment prospects, promotion prospects, conditions of work, safety and hygiene at work, and other aspects of working life in the various sectors of economic, social and cultural activity and at all levels of responsibility.  

(3) The information and guidance should be supplemented by information on general aspects of collective agreements and of the rights and obligations of all concerned under labour law; this information should be provided in accordance with national law and practice, taking into account the respective functions and tasks of the workers' and employers' organisations concerned.    

8. 

(1) The main objectives of vocational guidance programmes should be to - 

(a) provide children and young persons not yet in the labour force with the basis for choosing a line of education or vocational training in the light of their aptitudes, abilities and interests and of employment opportunities;  

(b) assist persons in programmes of education and vocational training to derive the maximum benefit from them and to prepare themselves either for supplementary education or vocational training or for entry into an occupation and for continuing education and training as and when required during their working lives;  

(c) assist persons who are entering the labour force, who seek to change their work activities, or who are unemployed, to choose an occupation and to plan related education and vocational training;  

(d) inform employed persons of opportunities for improving their occupational development potential, their level of performance, their earnings and their position, of the educational and vocational training requirements and of the facilities available for this purpose;  

(e) promote general awareness of the contribution which are and can be made by the various sectors of the economy and branches of economic activity, including those which have traditionally enjoyed little prestige, to general development and to expanding employment;  

(f) assist co-operating institutions to provide information and feedback on the effectiveness of particular programmes as an integral part of vocational guidance.    

(2) Members should ensure that such programmes are compatible with the right to freedom of choice in selecting an occupation and to fair promotion opportunities as well as the right to education.    

9. In extending the scope of their systems of vocational guidance, Members should pay special attention to - 

(a) helping children and young persons at school to gain an appreciation of the value and importance of work and an understanding of the world of work as well as to familiarise themselves with the conditions of work in as broad a range of occupations as possible - taking account of the employment and career opportunities that may be open to them - and with requirements for taking advantage of these opportunities;  

(b) giving children and young persons who have never been to school, or who left school early, information on as broad a range of occupations as possible and on employment opportunities in these occupations, as well as guidance on how they may gain access to them;  

(c) giving adults in employment, including self-employment, information on trends and objectives in development which concern them and in particular on the implications of social, technical and economic change for their field of work;  

(d) giving unemployed and under-employed persons all the necessary information and guidance on possibilities of finding employment or improving their employment situation and on means available for achieving this purpose;  

(e) giving persons who meet special problems in relation to education, vocational training or employment, assistance in overcoming them within over-all measures aiming at social progress.    

10. 

(1) Both group vocational guidance programmes - namely the dissemination of factual material and counselling for groups of persons who have similar vocational needs - and individual counselling should be made available.  

(2) Individual counselling should be available, in particular, to young persons and adults requiring specialised assistance in identifying their occupational aptitudes, abilities and interests, in assessing the educational, vocational training and employment opportunities which are likely to be available to them, and in choosing a line of education, vocational training or employment.  

(3) Individual counselling - and, as appropriate, group vocational guidance activities - should take into account the individual's specific need of information and support, with particular attention to the physically and mentally handicapped and disabled as well as to socially and educationally disadvantaged persons. They may include exercises in seeking and evaluating information and in decision making, as well as exposure to expanded career choices and goals, in order to develop the capacity to make an informed choice. They should always take into account the individual's right to make his own choice on the basis of comprehensive relevant information.  

(4) Individual counselling should, whenever required, be supplemented by advice for remedial action and such other help as may be useful for the purposes of vocational adjustment.    

11. Members whose vocational guidance programmes are in the early stages of development should, in the first instance, aim at - 

(a) drawing the attention of young persons to the importance of choosing general and vocational education taking full account of existing employment prospects and of trends in economic and social development, as well as of their personal aptitudes and interests;  

(b) assisting those groups of the population which require help in overcoming traditional restrictions on their free choice of education, vocational training or occupation;  

(c) meeting the needs of those with special potential in fields of work which are of major importance.    

12. Members should make full use, in their vocational guidance programmes, of all available facilities and media through which the various groups of the population concerned can be reached most effectively.  

13. 

(1) Wherever practicable, appropriate tests of capacity and aptitude - including both physiological and psychological characteristics - and other methods of examination should be made available for use in vocational guidance as appropriate to the needs of individual cases.  

(2) Such tests and other methods of examination should be used only in agreement with the person seeking guidance and in conjunction with other methods of exploring personal characteristics; they should be carried out only by specialists.  

(3) The results obtained in the application of such tests and other methods of examination should not be communicated to a third person without the express agreement of the person examined.    

14. 

(1) Where tests and other methods of examination are employed in vocational guidance, they should be standardised for the age groups, populations and cultures concerned and should be validated for the particular purposes for which they are intended.  

(2) There should be a continuing programme for the development and restandardisation, at regular intervals, of such tests and other methods of examination in order to take account of changing conditions and life styles.      

### IV  

####Vocational training

###A. *General provisions*

15. 

(1) Members should gradually extend, adapt and harmonise the vocational training systems of their respective countries to meet the needs for vocational training throughout life of both young persons and adults in all sectors of the economy and branches of economic activity and at all levels of skill and responsibility.  

(2) In doing so they should pay special attention to 

(a) providing opportunities for promotion which should be open, wherever possible, to persons with the desire and ability to reach higher levels of skill and responsibility;  

(b) improving vocational training in sectors of the economy and branches of economic activity in which vocational training is largely unsystematic and in which obsolescent technologies and methods of work prevail;  

(c) providing vocational training for members of the population who had not received adequate attention in the past, in particular for groups which are economically or socially disadvantaged;  

(d) effectively co-ordinating general education and vocational training, theoretical and practical instruction and initial and further training.

(c) specialisation in directly usable knowledge and skills for employment opportunities which already exist or are to be created;  

(d) supervised initiation into a real work situation.    

19. 

(1) Full-time courses of initial training should, wherever possible, provide for adequate synchronisation between theoretical tuition in training institutions and training given on the job in undertakings in order to ensure that the former is related to the real work situation; similarly, practical training off the job should, as far as possible, be related to real work situations.  

(2) Training on the job arranged as an integral part of courses given by training institutions should be planned jointly by the undertakings, institutions and workers' representatives concerned with a view to - 

(a) enabling the trainees to apply in actual working conditions what they have learned off the job;  

(b) providing training in aspects of the occupation which cannot be covered outside undertakings;  

(c) familiarising young persons with little or no work experience with the requirements and conditions they are likely to encounter at work and with their responsibilities within a working group.      

20. Persons entering employment after completing the full-time courses mentioned in Paragraph 19 above should receive - 

(a) introduction to familiarise them with the nature and objectives of the undertaking and the conditions in which work is performed there;  

(b) systematic complementary training on the job, together with the necessary theoretical courses;  

(c) as far as possible, planned experience in a series of activities and functions of training value, including adjustment to the workplace.

22. 

(1) Undertakings should, in consultation with workers' representatives, with the persons concerned and with those in charge of their work, establish and review at regular intervals furthertraining plans for persons in their employment at all levels of skill and responsibility; a joint committee may be established for the purpose.  

(2) These plans should - 

(a) provide opportunities to qualify for advancement to higher levels of skill and responsibility;  

(b) cover technical and other training and work experience for the persons concerned;  

(c) take account of the abilities and interests of the persons concerned as well as of work requirements.    

(3) Persons in charge of the work of others should have an obligation to make an effective contribution to the success of furthertraining plans.  

(4) Organisational responsibility for the establishment, implementation and review of further-training plans should be clearly defined and should be assigned, as far as possible, to a special unit or to one or more persons operating at a level commensurate with such responsibility.    

23. 

(1) Workers being trained within an undertaking should - 

(a) receive adequate allowances or remuneration;  

(b) be covered by the social security measures applicable to the regular workforce of the undertaking concerned.

24. 

(1) Initial and further training leading to recognised occupational qualifications should be covered as far as possible by general standards set or approved by the competent body, after consultation with the employers' and workers' organisations concerned.  

(2) These standards should indicate - 

(a) the level of skills and knowledge required of candidates for the various vocational training courses;  

(b) the level of performance to be attained in each major activity or function of the occupation concerned during each phase of training and, as far as possible, the content and duration of training and the facilities and equipment needed to ensure that the level of performance indicated may be attained;  

(c) the part of the vocational training to be provided by the system of formal education, by vocational training institutions, by undertakings through training on the job, or by other means;  

(d) the character and duration of any work experience that may be required in vocational training programmes;  

(e) the training content, on the basis of the principles of multipurpose training and occupational mobility;  

(f) the methodology to be applied, taking into account the objectives of the training and the characteristics of the trainees;  

(g) any examinations to be taken or other means of assessing achievement;  

(h) the certificates to be issued on successful completion of vocational training.      

25. 

(1) The same occupation may be covered by more than one vocational training standard when, and for as long as, the conditions in which the work is carried out and the activities it involves vary widely between different sectors of the economy, branches of economic activity or undertakings of different sizes.  

(2) Standards covering the same occupations should be coordinated in order to facilitate job mobility, with full recognition of the qualifications already held and of work experience in the occupation.    

26. 

(1) Guidelines indicating the desirable organisation and content of vocational training should be established for occupations, levels of skill and knowledge and levels of responsibility for which the standards provided for in Paragraph 24 of this Recommendation are shown not to be appropriate.  

(2) Such guidelines may be necessary in particular to cover - 

(a) training for future supervisors, specialists and managers and for persons already employed in these capacities;  

(b) training for training officers and for managers, supervisors and instructors of vocational training;  

(c) vocational training for branches of economic activity in which there are large numbers of self-employed persons or of small undertakings;  

(d) the improvement of vocational training for branches of economic activity in which there has been little or no provision for the necessary systematic vocational training, and for undertakings using obsolescent technologies and methods of work.    

(3) Such guidelines may also be appropriate for the first training in employment of persons who have just completed full-time courses of initial training in educational and vocational training institutions.    

27. Vocational training standards and guidelines should be evaluated and reviewed periodically, with the participation of employers' and workers' organisations, and adjusted to changing requirements, the periodicity of review being determined by the rate of change in the occupation concerned.  

28. 

(1) Members should gradually establish standards and guidelines or, as the case may be, extend their applicability until all major occupations and all levels of skill and responsibility are covered.  

(2) Priority should be given to vocational training for occupations and levels of skill and responsibility of key importance for social and economic advancement.      

### V

30. 

(1) The content of programmes of training for management and supervisory functions should take account of the level of the current and prospective responsibilities of the trainees.  

(2) The programmes should be designed in particular to - 

(a) develop an adequate knowledge and understanding of the economic and social aspects of decision making;

### VI  

####Programmes for particular areas or branches of economic activity

32. 

(1) Appropriate programmes of vocational guidance and vocational training should be established for particular areas or branches of economic activity in which comprehensive improvement action or major structural change is required.

Among the areas or branches of economic activity for which such programmes may be required, particular attention might be given to rural areas, to branches of economic activity using obsolescent technologies and methods of work, to industries and undertakings in decline or converting their activities, and to planned or newly established industries.   
###A. *Rural areas*

34. 

(1) Programmes for rural areas should aim at achieving full equality of opportunity of the rural and urban populations as regards vocational guidance and vocational training.

(2) Such programmes should take account of differences in needs according to the type of rural activity involved, its degree of mechanisation, specialisation and modernisation and the scale on which it is conducted,  

(3) Programmes for rural areas should include training in organising co-operatives and in managing undertakings.    

36. 

(1) Countries in which facilities and programmes of vocational guidance and vocational training for rural areas are as yet little developed should concentrate initally on - 

(a) providing information for young persons and adults in rural areas on the objectives of and action proposed for making improvements or major structural changes in the area and on the implications of such action for their work and lives;  

(b) providing systematic education and vocational training, full time or part time as appropriate, for young persons in employment to complement informal learning on the job;  

(c) providing short programmes of upgrading training or of retraining for adults through existing vocational training, or extension or other advisory services;  

(d) developing social and economic leadership in rural areas and encouraging participation by broader groups of the population in development action;  

(e) encouraging a desire for self-improvement.    

(2) Such countries should keep their priorities for rural areas under review so as to work progressively towards - 

(a) developing comprehensive vocational information and guidance services for the rural population as a whole;  

(b) introducing or generalising systematic initial training for young persons;  

(c) introducing comprehensive programmes of further training on a continuing or recurrent basis to meet the needs of adults.      

37. Countries which, for financial reasons or lack of trained personnel, are not in a position to provide adequate services for the rural population as a whole, might consider - 

(a) concentrating action temporarily on limited geographical areas where important lessons may be learnt for subsequent action in other areas;  

(b) giving preference to landless labourers and other economically weak groups in rural areas, which are in greatest need of economic and social justice.     
###B. *Branches of economic activity using obsolescent technologies and methods of work*

38. 

(1) Programmes for branches of economic activity and occupations in which the use of obsolescent technologies and methods of work is widespread should be developed as appropriate along similar lines to those for rural areas.  

(2) The aim should be to provide vocational guidance and vocational training for persons employed in or entering these branches of economic activity or occupations which will enable them to participate in or contribute to the modernisation of methods and products and to benefit from changes introduced.    

39. Extension and other advisory services for self-employed persons and small entrepreneurs in these branches of economic activity and occupations should provide them with information on possibilities of innovation in their work, and on related vocational training and other services.  

40. In planning vocational training for such branches of economic activity and occupations particular consideration should be given to - 

(a) needs and opportunities for extending the scope of or for specialising the activities of undertakings, and the vocational training implications of such extension or specialisation;  

(b) possibilities of improving vocational training practices and, in particular, of providing opportunities for continuing training;  

(c) possibilities of combining training services to managers of undertakings with other action for raising the level of performance;  

(d) the creation of new opportunities for gainful employment.    

41. Vocational training for such branches of economic activity and occupations - 

(a) may be conceived initially as a complement to the learning systems by which work knowledge and skills are traditionnally acquired;

###C. *Industries and undertakings in decline or converting their activities*

42. When industries or undertakings begin to decline, workers affected should in good time receive vocational guidance and vocational training to facilitate a change in skills and provide the opportunity of finding new employment.  

43. When industries or undertakings change their products and methods of production or the services they provide, workers affected should in good time receive training, organised in co-operation with the industries or undertakings concerned, to enable them to adapt themselves to their new tasks.   
###D. *New industries*

44. In planning vocational guidance and vocational training in connection with the establishment of new industries, account should be taken of-

(b) needs for independent workers and entrepreneurs to undertake subcontracting for the new industries;  

(c) the need to provide information relating to and vocational training for new activities rendered possible or necessary by the change in the economic conditions in the region;

### III  

####Beroepskeuzevoorlichting

7. 

(1) De Leden dienen hun systemen van beroepskeuzevoorlichting en die van voortdurende voorlichting inzake de werkgelegenheid geleidelijk uit te breiden teneinde een volledige informatie en een zo ruim mogelijke voorlichting binnen het bereik te brengen van kinderen, jongeren en volwassenen, met inbegrip van passende programma's voor gehandicapten.  

(2) Deze informatie en voorlichting dienen de volgende gebieden te bestrijken: beroepskeuze, beroepsopleiding en de daarmede verbandhoudende onderwijsmogelijkheden, de huidige en de toekomstige werkgelegenheid, promotiekansen, arbeidsvoorwaarden, bedrijfsveiligheid en -hygiëne alsmede andere aspecten van de arbeid in de diverse sectoren van het economische, sociale en culturele leven en op alle niveaus van verantwoordelijkheid.  

(3) Deze informatie en voorlichting dienen te worden aangevuld met informatie omtrent de algemene aspecten van de collectieve overeenkomsten en de rechten en plichten van alle betrokken partijen krachtens de arbeidswetgeving; deze aanvullende informatie dient te worden verstrekt overeenkomstig nationale wetten en gebruiken, met inachtneming van de onderscheiden functies en taken van de betrokken werknemers- en werkgeversorganisaties.    

8. De voornaamste doelstellingen van de programma's voor beroepskeuzevoorlichting dienen te zijn: 

(1) 

(a) kinderen en jongeren die nog niet aan het arbeidsproces deelnemen in staat te stellen het soort onderwijs of beroepsopleiding te kiezen dat overeenkomt met hun aanleg, hun capaciteiten en hun belangstelling in het licht van de mogelijkheden van tewerkstelling;  

(b) personen die gebruik maken van programma's voor onderwijs en beroepsopleiding, te helpen hiervan zoveel mogelijk profijt te trekken en zich erop voor te bereiden om hetzij hun algemene vorming of beroepsopleiding aan te vullen, hetzij om deel te nemen aan het arbeidsproces en daarbij te profiteren van de mogelijkheden voor voortdurende bijscholing die zij in hun beroepsleven nodig kunnen hebben;  

(c) aankomende arbeidskrachten alsmede degenen die van werkkring willen veranderen of die werkloos zijn, te helpen bij het kiezen van een beroep en bij het verkrijgen van de scholing en de beroepsopleiding die daarvoor nodig zijn;  

(d) de personen die een beroep uitoefenen te wijzen op de mogelijkheden om zich verder te ontwikkelen in hun beroep, een hoger niveau van vakbekwaamheid te bereiken, inkomen en hun positie te verbeteren, alsmede te wijzen op de daartoe geldende vereisten van scholing en beroepsopleiding en op de hiervoor beschikbare faciliteiten;  

(e) in brede kring begrip te wekken voor de bijdrage aan de ontwikkeling in het algemeen en aan de uitbreiding van de werkgelegenheid die wordt geleverd door de verschillende economische sectoren en bedrijfstakken, met inbegrip van die welke van oudsher niet hoog staan aangeschreven;  

(f) deelnemende instellingen te helpen om als onderdeel van de beroepskeuzevoorlichting inlichtingen te verschaffen omtrent de doeltreffendheid van specifieke opleidingsprogramma's.    

(2) De Leden dienen erop toe te zien dat deze programma's verenigbaar zijn met het recht op vrije keuze van een werkkring en op eerlijke promotiekansen alsmede met het recht op onderwijs.    

9. Bij het verruimen van hun stelsels van beroepskeuzevoorlichting, dienen de Leden in het bijzonder erop toe te zien dat: 

(a) schoolgaande kinderen en jongeren begrip wordt bijgebracht voor de waarde en het belang van de arbeid en dat zij - met inachtneming van de voor hen eventueel openstaande arbeids- en carrièremogelijkheden - vertrouwd worden gemaakt met de arbeidsvoorwaarden in een zo breed mogelijk scala van beroepen alsmede met de vereisten waaraan dient te worden voldaan om van deze arbeids- en carrièremogelijkheden gebruik te maken:  

(b) aan kinderen en jongeren die nooit een school hebben bezocht of die reeds vroegtijdig de school hebben verlaten, informatie wordt verstrekt over een zo breed mogelijk scala van beroepen, over de mogelijkheden van tewerkstelling in deze beroepen alsmede voorlichting over de manier waarop tot deze beroepen toegang kan worden verkregen;  

(c) volwassenen die in loondienst of als zelfstandigen werkzaam zijn, worden ingelicht over de strekkingen en de doelstellingen van de ontwikkeling die voor hen van belang zijn en in het bijzonder over de gevolgen die veranderingen op maatschappelijk, technisch en economisch gebied kunnen hebben voor hun arbeidsterrein;  

(d) aan werklozen en personen met onvolledige werktijden alle nodige informatie en voorlichting worden verschaft over de mogelijkheden om werk te vinden of hun arbeidssituatie te verbeteren alsmede over de daartoe beschikbare middelen;  

(e) in het kader van algemene maatregelen, gericht op sociale vooruitgang, aan personen die te kampen hebben met bijzondere problemen op het gebied van onderwijs, beroepsopleiding of tewerkstelling, hulp wordt verleend om deze moeilijkheden te kunnen overwinnen.    

10. 

(1) Er dienen zowel programma's voor collectieve beroepskeuzevoorlichting - d.w.z. het verspreiden van concrete informatie en adviezen voor personen die dezelfde beroepsvoorlichting nodig hebben - te worden uitgevoerd als individuele adviezen te worden gegeven.  

(2) Deze individuele adviezen dienen in het bijzonder te worden gegeven aan jongeren en volwassenen die gespecialiseerde hulp nodig hebben om zich een denkbeeld te kunnen vormen van hun aanleg, hun capaciteiten en hun belangstelling voor een bepaald beroep, om kennis te kunnen nemen van de mogelijkheden die er eventueel voor hen openstaan op het gebied van onderwijs, beroepsopleiding en tewerkstelling en om hierin een bepaalde richting te kunnen kiezen.  

(3) Bij de individuele adviezen - eventueel bij de collectieve beroepskeuzevoorlichting - dient rekening te worden gehouden met de specifieke behoefte aan informatie en hulp van ieder afzonderlijk, waarbij bijzondere aandacht dient te worden geschonken aan lichamelijk en geestelijk gehandicapten alsmede aan personen die op maatschappelijk gebied of op het gebied van scholing in een ongunstige positie verkeren. Teneinde het vermogen van de desbetreffende personen tot het doen van een weloverwogen keuze te ontwikkelen, kunnen deze adviezen inhouden een training in het opsporen en evalueren van informatie alsmede in het nemen van beslissingen alsmede een training in het kiezen, wanneer een breed scala aan alternatieven en doelstellingen voor een loopbaan voorhanden is. Bij deze adviezen dient te allen tijde rekening te worden gehouden met het recht van ieder mens zijn eigen keuze te bepalen aan de hand van volledige informatie.  

(4) De individuele adviezen dienen, waar nodig, te worden aangevuld met adviezen betreffende psychologische begeleiding of andere vormen van hulp die de betrokkene van dienst zouden kunnen zijn bij de aanpassing in zijn beroep.    

11. De Leden wier programma's voor beroepskeuzevoorlichting nog niet zover zijn ontwikkeld, dienen zich in de eerste plaats ten doel te stellen: 

(a) de aandacht van de jongeren te vestigen op het belang om bij hun keuze van algemeen- en beroepsonderwijs ten volle rekening te houden met de te verwachten werkgelegenheidssituatie en de tendensen in de economische en sociale ontwikkeling en met hun persoonlijke belangstelling en aanleg;  

(b) de bevolkingsgroepen die hieraan behoefte hebben te helpen bij het overwinnen van eventuele hinderpalen voortkomend uit bestaande tradities die een vrije keuze van onderwijs, beroepsopleiding of beroep voor hen in de weg zouden staan;  

(c) tegemoet te komen aan de behoeften van hen die buitengewone capaciteiten bezitten op arbeidsgebieden die van bijzonder belang zijn.    

12. Bij hun beroepskeuzevoorlichting dienen de Leden ten volle gebruik te maken van alle beschikbare voorzieningen en communicatiemiddelen waardoor de betrokken bevolkingsgroepen zo doeltreffend mogelijk kunnen worden bereikt.  

13. 

(1) Voor zover mogelijk dient er gebruik te worden gemaakt van passende tests voor het onderzoek van de capaciteiten en aanleg - daaronder begrepen zowel fysiologische als psychologische eigenschappen - alsmede van andere methoden van onderzoek ten behoeve van de beroepskeuzevoorlichting, al naar gelang de behoeften van het individuele geval.  

(2) Deze tests en andere methoden van onderzoek mogen slechts worden gebruikt met toestemming van de persoon die beroepskeuzevoorlichting wenst en zij dienen te worden gecombineerd met andere technieken voor het vaststellen van persoonlijke eigenschappen. Zij dienen alleen door deskundigen te worden uitgevoerd.  

(3) De resultaten van deze tests en andere onderzoeken mogen slechts met voorafgaande toestemming van de betrokkene aan derden worden medegedeeld.    

14. 

(1) Wanneer er bij de beroepskeuzevoorlichting gebruik wordt gemaakt van tests of andere methden van onderzoek, dienen deze te worden gestandaardiseerd voor alle betrokken leeftijdsgroepen, bevolkingsgroepen en culturen, en de waarde ervan dient te worden getoetst aan de specifieke doeleinden waarvoor zij zijn bestemd.  

(2) Deze tests en andere methoden van onderzoek dienen voortdurend en op gezette tijden te worden ontwikkeld en aangepast, teneinde rekening te kunnen houden met veranderde levensomstandigheden en levenswijzen.

###B. *Normen en richtlijnen voor beroepsopleiding*

24. 

(1) De basisberoepsopleiding en de nascholing die het mogelijk maken erkende vakbekwaamheid te verwerven, dienen zoveel mogelijk te zijn onderworpen aan algemene normen die zijn opgesteld of goedgekeurd door het bevoegde orgaan na raadpleging van de betrokken werkgevers- en werknemersorganisaties.  

(2) Deze normen dienen aan te geven: 

(a) het niveau van vakbekwaamheid en kennis van de kandidaten dat is vereist voor de onderscheiden cursussen van vakopleiding;  

(b) het te bereiken niveau van vakkundigheid in iedere fase van de opleiding, in elk der voornaamste werkzaamheden of functies van het betreffende beroep, alsmede zoveel mogelijk de inhoud en de duur van de opleiding, de voorzieningen en de uitrusting, die nodig zijn om de kandidaten in staat te stellen het bedoelde niveau te bereiken;  

(c) het gedeelte van de beroepsopleiding dat dient te worden verzorgd door het gewone schoolsysteem, door de instellingen voor beroepsopleiding, door de bedrijven, hetzij op het werk zelf hetzij anderszins;  

(d) de aard en duur van iedere stage die verplicht kan worden gesteld tijdens de beroepsopleiding;  

(e) de inhoud van de opleiding op grond van het beginsel van toepasbaarheid op een verscheidenheid van beroepen en dat van beroepsmobiliteit;  

(f) de toe te passen methodiek, met inachtneming van de doelstellingen van de opleiding en van de eigenschappen van de cursisten;  

(g) de examens en andere middelen waarmee de bereikte resultaten kunnen worden gecontroleerd;  

(h) de diploma's die worden uitgereikt wanneer een beroepsopleiding met succes is gevolgd.      

25. 

(1) Indien er tussen de verschillende sectoren van de economie of de verschillende bedrijfstakken of tussen bedrijven van verschillende omvang duidelijke verschillen bestaan ten aanzien van de werkzaamheden die eenzelfde beroep met zich brengt en de omstandigheden waaronder dit wordt uitgeoefend, kan dit beroep onder meer dan één norm voor de beroepsopleiding vallen zolang de verschillen bestaan.  

(2) De normen die op dezelfde beroepen van toepassing zijn, dienen te worden gecoördineerd om de verandering van werkkring binnen hetzelfde beroep te vergemakkelijken, met dien verstande dat de reeds verworven vakbekwaamheid en beroepservaring ten volle worden erkend.    

26. 

(1) Er dienen richtlijnen te worden opgesteld, die aangeven hoe de beroepsopleiding organisatorisch dient te worden opgezet en wat hiervan de inhoud dient te zijn, voor die beroepen, die niveaus van vakbekwaamheid en kennis en die niveaus van verantwoordelijkheid waarvoor de in paragraaf 24 van deze Aanbeveling bedoelde normen niet geschikt blijken te zijn.  

(2) Dergelijke richtlijnen kunnen noodzakelijk blijken te zijn met name wat betreft: 

(a) de opleiding van toekomstige kaderleden, deskundigen en leden van de directie, of van personen die reeds dergelijke functies bekleden;  

(b) de opleiding van leerkrachten en van cursusleiders, inspecteurs en instructeurs van de beroepsopleiding;  

(c) de beroepsopleiding in bedrijfstakken met een groot aantal zelfstandigen of kleine ondernemingen;  

(d) de verbetering van de beroepsopleiding zowel in bedrijfstakken waar weinig of geen maatregelen zijn getroffen voor de nodige systematische beroepsopleiding, als in bedrijven waar technieken en werkwijzen worden gebruikt die aan veroudering onderhevig zijn.    

(3) Dergelijke richtlijnen kunnen ook geschikt zijn voor de eerste praktijkopleiding van personen die zojuist volledige dagcursussen van een basisopleiding hebben beëindigd aan onderwijsinstellingen of aan instellingen voor beroepsopleiding.    

27. De normen en de richtlijnen voor de beroepsopleiding dienen regelmatig te worden beoordeeld en herzien in samenwerking met werknemers- en werkgeversorganisaties, en te worden aangepast aan wijzigingen in de vereisten. De regelmaat waarmede zij worden herzien hangt af van het tempo waarin wijzigingen in het desbetreffende beroep optreden.  

28. 

(1) De Leden dienen geleidelijk normen en richtlijnen op te stellen, of zo nodig het toepassingsgebied daarvan zodanig uit te breiden dat alle voornaamste beroepen en alle niveaus van vakbekwaamheid en verantwoordelijkheid eronder vallen.  

(2) Aan de beroepsopleiding voor beroepen en niveaus van vakbekwaamheid en verantwoordelijkheid die toonaangevend zijn voor de economische en sociale vooruitgang dient voorrang te worden gegeven.      

### V  

####Opleiding voor bedrijfsleiders en voor zelfstandigen
