### PART  I  

####SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS

### Article  1  

1.  This Convention applies to every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, which is registered in the territory of any Member for which the Convention is in force and is ordinarily engaged in commercial maritime operations. For the purpose of this Convention, a ship that is on the register of two Members is deemed to be registered in the territory of the Member whose flag it flies.   
2.  To the extent it deems practicable, after consulting the representative organizations of fishing-vessel owners and fishermen, the competent authority shall apply the provisions of this Convention to commercial maritime fishing.   
3.  In the event of doubt as to whether or not any ships are to be regarded as seagoing ships or engaged in commercial maritime operations or commercial maritime fishing for the purpose of the Convention, the question shall be determined by the competent authority after consulting the organizations of shipowners, seafarers and fishermen concerned.   
4.  This Convention does not apply to wooden vessels of traditional build such as dhows and junks.   

### Article  2  

For the purpose of this Convention: 

a) the term “competent authority" means the minister, government department or other authority having power to issue regulations, orders or other instructions having the force of law in respect of seafarers' hours of work or rest or the manning of ships;  

b) the term “hours of work" means time during which a seafarer is required to do work on account of the ship;  

c) the term “hours of rest" means time outside hours of work; this term does not include short breaks;  

d) the term “seafarer" means any person defined as such by national laws or regulations or collective agreements who is employed or engaged in any capacity on board a seagoing ship to which this Convention applies;  

e) the term “shipowner" means the owner of the ship or any other organization or person, such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner and who on assuming such responsibility has agreed to take over all the attendant duties and responsibilities.    

### PART  II  

####SEAFARERS HOURS OF WORK AND HOURS OF REST

### Article  3  

Within the limits set out in Article 5, there shall be fixed either a maximum number of hours of work which shall not be exceeded in a given period of time, or a minimum number of hours of rest which shall be provided in a given period of time.  

### Article  4  

A Member which ratifies this Convention acknowledges that the normal working hours' standard for seafarers, like that for other workers, shall be based on an eight-hour day with one day of rest per week and rest on public holidays. However, this shall not prevent the Member from having procedures to authorize or register a collective agreement which determines seafarers' normal working hours on a basis no less favourable than this standard.  

### Article  5  

1.  The limits on hours of work or rest shall be as follows: 

a) maximum hours of work shall not exceed: 

(i) 14 hours in any 24-hour period; and  

(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period; or    

b) minimum hours of rest shall not be less than: 

(i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and  

(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.       
2.  Hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours in length, and the interval between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.   
3.  Musters, fire-fighting and lifeboat drills, and drills prescribed by national laws and regulations and by international instruments shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes the disturbance of rest periods and does not induce fatigue.   
4.  In respect of situations when a seafarer is on call, such as when a machinery space is unattended, the seafarer shall have an adequate compensatory rest period if the normal period of rest is disturbed by call-outs to work.   
5.  If no collective agreement or arbitration award exists or if the competent authority determines that the provisions in the agreement or award in respect of paragraph 3 or 4 are inadequate, the competent authority shall determine such provisions to ensure the seafarers concerned have sufficient rest.   
6.  Nothing in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall prevent the Member from having national laws or regulations or a procedure for the competent authority to authorize or register collective agreements permitting exceptions to the limits set out. Such exceptions shall, as far as possible, follow the standards set out but may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods or the granting of compensatory leave for watchkeeping seafarers or seafarers working on board ships on short voyages.   
7.  The Member shall require the posting, in an easily accessible place, of a table with the shipboard working arrangements, which shall contain for every position at least: 

a) the schedule of service at sea and service in port; and  

b) the maximum hours of work or the minimum hours of rest required by the laws, regulations or collective agreements in force in the flag State.     
8.  The table referred to in paragraph 7 shall be established in a standardized format in the working language or languages of the ship and in English.   

### Article  6  

No seafearer under 18 years of age shall work at night. For the purpose of this Article, “night" means a period of at least nine consecutive hours, including the interval from midnight to five a.m. This provision need not be applied when the effective training of young seafarers between the ages of 16 and 18 in accordance with established programmes and schedules would be impaired.

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to impair the right of the master of a ship to require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the ship, persons on board or cargo, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other ships or persons in distress at sea.   
2.  In accordance with paragraph 1, the master may suspend the schedule of hours of work or hours of rest and require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored.   
3.  As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored, the master shall ensure that any seafarers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.   

### Article  8  

1.  The Member shall require that records of seafarers' daily hours of work or of their daily hours of rest be maintained to allow monitoring of compliance with the provisions set out in Article 5. The seafarer shall receive a copy of the records pertaining to him or her which shall be endorsed by the master, or a person authorized by the master, and by the seafarer.   
2.  The competent authority shall determine the procedures for keeping such records on board, including the intervals at which the information shall be recorded. The competent authority shall establish the format of the records of the seafarers' hours of work or of their hours of rest taking into account any available International Labour Organization guidelines or shall use any standard format prepared by the Organization. The format shall be established in the language or languages provided by Article 5, paragraph 8.   
3.  A copy of the relevant provisions of the national legislation pertaining to this Convention and the relevant collective agreements shall be kept on board and be easily accessible to the crew.   

### Article  9  

The competent authority shall examine and endorse the records referred to in Article 8, at appropriate intervals, to monitor compliance with the provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest that give effect to this Convention.  

### Article  10

### PART  III  

####MANNING OF SHIPS

### Article  11  

1.  Every ship to which this Convention applies shall be sufficiently, safely and efficiently manned, in accordance with the minimum safe manning document or an equivalent issued by the competent authority.   
2.  When determining, approving or revising manning levels, the competent authority shall take into account: 

a) the need to avoid or minimize, as far as practicable, excessive hours of work, to ensure sufficient rest and to limit fatigue; and  

b) the international instruments identified in the Preamble.     

### Article  12  

No person under 16 years of age shall work on a ship.  

### PART  IV  

####RESPONSIBILITIES OF SHIPOWNERS AND MASTERS

### Article  13  

The shipowner shall ensure that the master is provided with the necessary resources for the purpose of compliance with obligations under this Convention, including those relating to the appropriate manning of the ship. The master shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the requirements on seafarers' hours of work and rest arising from this Convention are complied with.  

### PART  V

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op elk zeeschip, hetzij staatseigendom hetzij particuliere eigendom, dat is teboekgesteld op het grondgebied van een Lid waarvoor dit Verdrag van kracht is en dat doorgaans wordt gebruikt voor commerciële maritieme activiteiten. Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt een schip dat bij twee Leden teboekgesteld is, geacht teboekgesteld te zijn op het grondgebied van het Lid waarvan het de vlag voert.   
2.  Voor zover de bevoegde autoriteit dit uitvoerbaar acht, en na overleg met de representatieve organisaties van reders in de visserij en van vissers, past de bevoegde autoriteit de bepalingen van dit Verdrag toe op de commerciële zeevisserij.   
3.  In geval van twijfel of een schip voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag dient te worden beschouwd als zeeschip of als gebruikt voor de commerciële maritieme exploitatie dan wel voor de commerciële zeevisserij, doet de bevoegde autoriteit na overleg met de betrokken organisaties van reders, zeevarenden en vissers daarin uitspraak.   
4.  Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing op houten schepen van traditionele bouw zoals dhows en jonken.

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: 

a. wordt onder de term „bevoegde autoriteit" verstaan de minister, de regeringsdienst of andere autoriteit die bevoegd is bindende voorschriften, reglementen of andere instructies uit te vaardigen met betrekking tot de werktijden of de rusttijden van zeevarenden of de bemanning van schepen;  

b. wordt onder de term „werktijden" verstaan de tijd gedurende welke een zeevarende wordt geacht werkzaamheden te verrichten ten behoeve van het schip;  

c. wordt onder de term „rusttijden" verstaan de tijd die buiten de arbeidstijd valt; hieronder worden korte onderbrekingen niet begrepen;  

d. wordt onder de term „zeevarende" verstaan een persoon die als zodanig wordt gedefinieerd in de nationale wetgeving of in collectieve overeenkomsten en die, in welke hoedanigheid dan ook, in dienst of tewerkgesteld is aan boord van een zeeschip waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is;  

e. wordt onder de term „reder" verstaan de eigenaar van het schip of elke andere organisatie of persoon, zoals de manager of rompbevrachter, die door de reder is belast met de verantwoordelijkheid voor de exploitatie van het schip en die bij de aanvaarding van die verantwoordelijkheid de verplichting op zich heeft genomen zich te kwijten van alle bijbehorende taken en verantwoordelijkheden.    

### DEEL  II  

####WERKTIJDEN EN RUSTTIJDEN VAN ZEEVARENDEN

### Artikel  3  

Binnen de in artikel 5 genoemde grenzen dient te worden vastgesteld hetzij het maximumaantal uren arbeid dat binnen een bepaald tijdvak niet mag worden overschreden, hetzij het minimumaantal uren rust dat binnen een bepaald tijdvak moet worden verschaft.  

### Artikel  4  

Elk Lid dat dit Verdrag bekrachtigt, erkent dat de norm voor de werktijden voor zeevarenden, evenals voor andere werknemers, acht uur per dag is, met een rustdag per week en rust op feestdagen. Niets weerhoudt het Lid echter om bepalingen aan te nemen voor het goedkeuren of het registreren van een collectieve overeenkomst waarin de normale werktijden voor zeevarenden worden vastgesteld op basis van een maatstaf die niet minder gunstig is dan genoemde norm.  

### Artikel  5  

1.  De werk- of rusttijden dienen binnen de volgende grenzen te worden vastgesteld: 

a. het maximumaantal arbeidsuren mag niet meer bedragen dan: 

i. 14 uren in iedere periode van 24 uur; en  

ii. 72 uren in iedere periode van zeven dagen; of    

b. het minimumaantal uren rust mag niet minder bedragen dan: 

i. tien uren in iedere periode van 24 uur; en  

ii. 77 uren in iedere periode van zeven dagen.       
2.  Het aantal uren rust mag worden verdeeld in maximaal twee perioden, waarvan een ten minste zes uren dient te bedragen, en het tijdsbestek gelegen tussen de opeenvolgende rustperioden mag niet meer bedragen dan 14 uren.   
3.  Appèls, brandweer- en reddingsoefeningen en oefeningen voorgeschreven door de nationale wetgeving en internationale akten dienen zodanig te verlopen dat hierdoor de verstoring van de rustperioden zoveel mogelijk wordt beperkt en geen vermoeidheid wordt veroorzaakt.   
4.  In geval van situaties waarin een zeevarende oproepbaar is, bijvoorbeeld wanneer een machinekamer onbemand is, dient de zeevarende een behoorlijke rustperiode ter compensatie te krijgen indien de normale rustperiode wordt onderbroken vanwege werkoproepen.   
5.  Indien er geen collectieve overeenkomst of scheidsrechterlijke beslissing bestaat of indien de bevoegde autoriteit oordeelt dat het bepaalde in de overeenkomst of beslissing ten aanzien van het in het derde of vierde lid gestelde ontoereikend is, dient de bevoegde autoriteit de nodige bepalingen uit te vaardigen teneinde te waarborgen dat de betrokken zeevarenden voldoende rust genieten.   
6.  Niets in het eerste en tweede lid weerhoudt het Lid ervan door middel van nationale wetgeving of een procedure de bevoegde autoriteit toe te staan collectieve overeenkomsten goed te keuren of te registreren die uitzonderingen toelaten op de vastgestelde grenzen. Deze uitzonderingen dienen zo veel mogelijk in overeenstemming te zijn met de vastgestelde normen, maar mogen voorzien in frequentere of langere verlofperioden, of in compensatieverlof voor zeevarenden in wachtdienst of zeevarenden werkzaam aan boord van schepen op reizen van korte duur.   
7.  Elk Lid dient te eisen dat op een gemakkelijk toegankelijke plaats een overzicht wordt opgehangen van de organisatie van de werkzaamheden aan boord, dat voor elke functie ten minste de volgende gegevens dient te bevatten: 

a. het rooster voor dienst op zee en dienst in de haven; en  

b. het maximumaantal arbeidsuren of het minimumaantal rusturen dat door de in de Vlaggestaat geldende wetgeving of collectieve overeenkomsten wordt voorgeschreven.

### Artikel  6  

Zeevarenden onder de achttien jaar mogen geen nachtarbeid verrichten. Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt onder „nacht" verstaan een tijdvak van ten minste negen achtereenvolgende uren, welk tijdvak de periode van middernacht tot vijf uur 's ochtends omvat. Van de toepassing van deze bepaling kan worden afgezien wanneer hierdoor de effectieve opleiding van zeevarenden in de leeftijd tussen 16 en 18 jaar, overeenkomstig de vastgestelde programma's en roosters, zou worden aangetast.  

### Artikel  7  

1.  Niets in dit Verdrag wordt geacht het recht aan te tasten van de kapitein om van een zeevarende te eisen dat hij de nodige uren arbeid verricht voor de onmiddellijke veiligheid van het schip, van personen aan boord of van de lading, of voor het verlenen van hulp aan andere op zee in nood verkerende schepen of personen.   
2.  Overeenkomstig het in het eerste lid bepaalde kan de kapitein de normale werk- of rusttijden opschorten en van een zeevarende eisen dat hij de nodige uren arbeid verricht totdat de normale situatie is hersteld.   
3.  Zodra praktisch uitvoerbaar na het herstel van de normale situatie, dient de kapitein ervoor zorg te dragen dat zeevarenden die arbeid hebben verricht in een periode waarin zij volgens het rooster rust hadden, een passende rustperiode wordt verschaft.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Het Lid dient te eisen dat de registratie van de dagelijkse werktijden of dagelijkse rusttijden van zeevarenden wordt bijgehouden ten behoeve van de controle op de naleving van de in artikel 5 genoemde bepalingen. De zeevarende dient een afschrift te ontvangen van de op hem of haar betrekking hebbende registratie, dat door de kapitein of een door hem gemachtigde persoon, alsmede door de zeevarende dient te worden geparafeerd.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit dient de procedures voor het bijhouden van deze registraties aan boord vast te stellen, met inbegrip van de periodes waarover de informatie wordt geregistreerd. De bevoegde autoriteit dient, rekening houdend met eventuele richtlijnen van de Internationale Arbeidsorganisatie, een model vast te stellen van de registratie van de werktijden of de rusttijden van zeevarenden, of dient gebruik te maken van een door deze Organisatie opgesteld standaardformulier. Het model dient te worden opgesteld in de in artikel 5, achtste lid, bedoelde taal of talen.   
3.  Een afschrift van de desbetreffende bepalingen van de nationale wetgeving die betrekking hebben op dit Verdrag alsmede van de desbetreffende collectieve overeenkomsten dient aan boord van het schip te worden bewaard op een voor de bemanning gemakkelijk toegankelijke plaats.   

### Artikel  9  

De bevoegde autoriteit dient de in artikel 8 bedoelde registraties op gezette tijden te verifiëren en te paraferen teneinde de naleving van de bepalingen betreffende de werktijden of rusttijden ter uitvoering van het Verdrag te controleren.  

### Artikel  10  

Indien uit de registraties of uit andere bewijsstukken blijkt dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de bepalingen betreffende de werktijden of de rusttijden, dient de bevoegde autoriteit zich ervan te overtuigen dat maatregelen worden genomen waaronder, indien nodig, het wijzigen van de samenstelling van de bemanning van het schip, teneinde nieuwe overtredingen te voorkomen.
