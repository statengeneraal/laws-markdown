### Article  II  

1.  The Contracting Governments undertake to co-operate, in accordance with the provisions of the present Convention, in the formulation and application of measures for the facilitation of the arrival, stay and departure of ships.

### Article  V  

1.  Nothing in the present Convention or its annex shall be interpreted as preventing the application of any wider facilities which a Contracting Government grants or may grant in future in respect of international maritime traffic under its national laws or the provisions of any other international agreement.   
2.  Nothing in the present Convention or its annex shall be interpreted as precluding a Contracting Government from applying temporary measures considered by that Government to be necessary to preserve public morality, order and security or to prevent the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting public health, animals or plants.

####ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF PERSONS

This section contains the provisions concerning the formalities required by public authorities from crew and passengers on the arrival or departure of a ship.  

### A  

####Arrival and departure requirements and procedures

3.1.  *Standard.* A valid passport shall be the basic document providing public authorities with information relating to the individual passenger on arrival or departure of a ship.   
3.1.1.  *Recommended Practice.* Contracting Governments should as far as possible agree, by bilateral or multilateral agreements, to accept official documents of identity in lieu of passports.   
3.2.  *Standard.* Public authorities shall make arrangements whereby passports, or official documents of identity accepted in their place, from ship’s passengers need be inspected by the immigration authorities only once at the time of arrival and once at the time of departure. In addition, these passports or official documents of identity may be required to be produced for the purpose of verification or identification in connection with customs and other formalities on arrival and departure.   
3.3.  *Standard.* After individual presentation of passports or official documents of identity accepted in their place, public authorities shall hand back such documents immediately after examination rather than withholding them for the purpose of obtaining additional control, unless there is some obstacle to the admission of a passenger to the territory.   
3.3.1.  *Standard.* Each Contracting Government shall ensure that the public authorities seize fraudulent, falsified or counterfeit travel documents of inadmissible persons. Such documents shall be removed from circulation and returned to the appropriate authorities when practicable. In place of a seized document, a covering letter shall be issued by the removing State and attached to it will be a photocopy of the forged travel documents, if available, as well as any important information. The covering letter and its attachment shall be handed over to the operator responsible for the removal of the inadmissible person. It will serve to give information to the authorities at the transit and/or the original point of embarkation. <sup> 6)  A possible format for a covering letter is given in appendix 2.  </sup> *Note:* The above Standard shall not be construed as overriding the right of the public authorities of the Contracting Governments to determine whether or not, depending on the individual case, possession of fraudulent documents in itself constitutes grounds for refusal of admission and prompt removal from the territory of the State concerned. Nothing in this Standard is to be construed as contradicting the provisions of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and the United Nations Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967, which concern the prohibitions of the expulsion or return of a refugee.   
3.3.2.  *Standard.* Contracting Governments shall accept for examination a person being returned from his point of disembarkation after having been found inadmissible if this person had embarked in their territory. Contracting Governments shall not return such a person to the country where he was earlier found to be inadmissible. *Note 1:* This provision is not intended to prevent public authorities from further examining a returned inadmissible person to determine his eventual acceptability in the State or make arrangements for his transfer, removal or deportation to a State of which he is a national or where he is otherwise acceptable. Where a person who has been found to be inadmissible has lost or destroyed his travel document, a Contracting Government will accept instead a document attesting to the circumstances of embarkation and arrival issued by the public authorities of the Contracting Government where the person was found to be inadmissible. *Note 2:* Noting in this Standard or in Note 1 is to be construed as contradicting the provisions of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967, which concern the prohibition of the expulsion or return of a refugee.   
3.3.3.  *Standard*. Before passengers and crew are accepted for examination as to their admissibility into the State, responsibility for their custody and care shall remain with the shipowner.   
3.3.4.  *Recommended Practice.* After acceptance of passengers and crew for examination, whether conditional or unconditional and if the persons concerned are under the physical control of the public authorities, the public authorities should be responsible for their custody and care until they are admitted for entry or are found to be inadmissible.   
3.3.5.  *Standard.* The obligation of a shipowner to transport any person away from the territory of a State shall terminate from the moment such a person has been definitely admitted into that State.   
3.3.6.  *Standard*. Where a person is found to be inadmissible, the public authorities shall, without unreasonable delay, inform the shipowner and consult the shipowner regarding the arrangements for removal. The shipowner is responsible for the costs of stay and removal of an inadmissible person and, in the case where the person is transferred back to the custody of the shipowner, the shipowner shall be responsible for effecting his/her prompt removal to: 

* the country of embarkation; or  

* to any other place where the person is admissible.     
3.3.7.  *Standard.* Contracting Governments and shipowners shall co-operate, where practicable, to establish the validity and authenticity of passports and visas.   
3.4.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should not require from embarking or disembarking passengers, or from shipowners on their behalf, any information in writing supplementary to or repeating that already presented in their passports or official documents of identity, other than as necessary to complete any documents provided for in this annex.   
3.5.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities which require written supplementary information, other than as necessary to complete any documents provided for in this annex, from embarking or disembarking passengers should limit requirements for further identification of passengers to the items set forth in Recommended Practice 3.6 (embarkation/disembarkation card). Public authorities should accept the embarkation/disembarkation card when completed by the passenger and should not require that it be completed or checked by the shipowner.

3.8.  *Recommended Practice.* Medical examination of persons on board or of persons disembarking from ships should normally be limited to those persons arriving from an area infected with quarantinable diseases within the incubation period of the disease concerned (as stated in the International Health Regulations). Additional medical examination may, however, be required in accordance with the International Health Regulations.   
3.9.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should normally perform customs inspections of inbound passengers’ accompanied baggage on a sampling or selective basis. Written declarations in respect of passengers’ accompanied baggage should be dispensed with as far as possible.   
3.9.1.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should, wherever possible, waive inspections of accompanied baggage of departing passengers, with due regard to the possible need to impose appropriate security measures.   
3.9.2.  *Recommended Practice.* Where inspection of accompanied baggage of departing passengers cannot be waived completely, such inspection should normally be performed on a sampling or selective basis.   
3.10.  *Standard*. A passport or an identity document issued in accordance with relevant ILO conventions, or else a valid and duly recognized seafarer’s identity document, shall be the basic document providing public authorities with information relating to the individual member of the crew on arrival or departure of a ship.

a) joining his ship or transferring to another ship,  

b) passing in transit to join his ship in another country, or for repatriation, or for any other purpose approved by the authorities of the country concerned,   public authorities shall accept from that seafarer in place of a passport the valid seafarer’s identity document, when this document guarantees the readmission of the bearer to the country which issued the document.   
3.10.3.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should not normally require presentation of individual identity documents or of information supplementing the seafarer’s identity document in respect of members of the crew other than that given in the Crew List.

####Measures to facilitate clearance of cargo, passengers, crew and baggage

3.11.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should, with the co-operation of shipowners and port authorities, take appropriate measures to the end that satisfactory port traffic flow arrangements may be provided so that passengers, crew and baggage can be cleared rapidly, should provide adequate personnel, and should ensure that adequate installations are provided, particular attention being paid to baggage loading, unloading and conveyance arrangements (including the use of mechanized systems) and to points where passenger delays are frequently found to occur. Arrangements should be made, when necessary, for passage under shelter between the ship and the point where the passenger and crew check is to be made. Such arrangements and installations should be flexible and capable of expansion to meet increased security measures during higher threat situations.   
3.11.1.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities should: 

a) in co-operation with shipowners and port authorities, introduce suitable arrangements, such as:

3.14.  *Standard.* Public authorities shall, without unreasonable delay, accept persons present on board a ship for examination as to their admissibility into the State.   
3.15.  *Recommended Practice*.

3.15.3.  *Recommended Practice.* For use at marine terminals and on board ships in order to facilitate and expedite international maritime traffic, public authorities should implement or, where the matter does not come within their jurisdiction, recommend responsible parties in their country to implement standardized international signs and symbols developed or accepted by the Organization in co-operation with other appropriate international organizations and which, to the greatest extent practicable, are common to all modes of transport.   

### C  

####Special facilities for marine transport of elderly and disabled passengers

3.16.  *Recommended Practice.* Measures should be taken to ensure that all necessary information on transport and safety is readily available for passengers who have impaired hearing or vision.

### SECTION  4  

####STOWAWAYS

### A

### B  

####Preventive measures

4.3.  Ship/Port preventive measures   
4.3.1.  Port/terminal authorities   
4.3.1.1.  *Standard.* Contracting Governments shall ensure that the necessary infrastructure, and operational and security arrangements for the purpose of preventing persons attempting to stowaway on board ships from gaining access to port installations and to ships, are established in all their ports, taking into consideration when developing these arrangements the size of the port, and what type of cargo is shipped from the port. This should be done in close co-operation with relevant public authorities, shipowners and shore-side entities, with the aim of preventing stowaway occurrences in the individual port.   
4.3.1.2.  *Recommended Practice.* Operational arrangements and/or security plans should, *inter alia*, address the following issues where appropriate:

Search methods, which are likely to harm secreted stowaways shall not be used.   
4.3.2.4.  *Standard.* Contracting Governments shall require that fumigation or sealing of ships entitled to fly their flag may not be carried out until a search which is as thorough as possible of the areas to be fumigated or sealed has taken place in order to ensure that no stowaways are present in those areas.   
4.3.3.  National Sanctions   
4.3.3.1.  *Standard.* Where appropriate, contracting Governments shall, according to their national legislation, prosecute stowaways, attempted stowaways and persons aiding stowaways in gaining access to ships.

This letter will include information required by the authorities at transit points and/or the point of disembarkation.   
4.14.2.  *Recommended Practice.* Public authorities in the State where the stowaway has disembarked should contact the relevant public authorities at transit points during the return of a stowaway, in order to inform them of the status of the stowaway. In addition public authorities in countries of transit during the return of any stowaway should allow, subject to normal visa requirements and national security concerns, the transit through their ports and airports of stowaways travelling under the removal instructions or directions of public authorities of the country of the port of disembarkation.   
4.14.3.  *Recommended Practice.* When a port State has refused disembarkation of a stowaway that State should, without undue delay, notify the Flag State of the ship carrying the stowaway of the reasons for refusing disembarkation.

####IMDG Code, Amendment 33-06, chapter 5.4 on Documentation

###Note 1:

The provisions of this Code do not preclude the use of electronic data processing (EDP) and electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission techniques as an aid to paper documentation. 
###Note 2:

When dangerous goods are offered for transport, similar documents to those required for other categories of goods have to be prepared. The form of these documents, the particulars to be entered on them and the obligations they entail may be fixed by international conventions applying to certain modes of transport and by national legislation. 
###Note 3:

One of the primary requirements of a transport document for dangerous goods is to convey the fundamental information relative to the hazards of the goods. It is, therefore, necessary to include certain basic information on the document for a consignment of dangerous goods unless otherwise exempted or required in this Code.

### Appendix  6  

####Simpler shipping marks

<sup> 1)  This is Recommendation No. 15, third edition (May 1992) of the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe, and has been adopted by the Working Party on Facilitation of International Trade Procedures.  </sup>  

### I  

####Background

1. The purpose of shipping marks is to identify cargo and help in moving it rapidly, smoothly and safely without delays or confusion to its final destination and to enable the checking of cargo against documents. However, in some instances marks have become so lengthy and detailed that the sides of packages can no longer hold them. It has been said that packages become documents. The result is unnecessary costs, mistakes, confusion and shipment delays, and the purpose of shipping marks is compromised.  

2. Shipping marks differ widely between countries and between modes of transport. With the increasing volume of international trade, with the advent of multimodal and combined transport, with the growing need to manage such data for the best use in modern systems and automatic data-processing facilities, and with increasing cost-consciousness, it is clear that simple and consistent standards for shipping marks should be established.  

3. Some of the benefits of such standardization are: 

*Reduced cost.* Each character eliminated from shipping marks saves time and money in marking goods, in typing documents, in transcribing information and in computer usage.  

*Quicker checking* of cargoes and documents – for instance, in cargo tallying and checking of documentary credits. This leads to quicker turn-round of vessels and improved cash flow.  

*Increased safety* by using internationally recognized symbols for handling instructions and danger warnings.  

*Trouble-free delivery of goods.* The purpose of shipping marks is fulfilled; the delays and other difficulties caused through lengthy, complex marks are avoided.

4. Following detailed research carried out in several countries, in particular in France, the German Democratic Republic, Japan, Sweden, The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, and in co-operation with international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) and the International Cargo Handling Co-ordination Association (ICHCA), it was agreed to put forward a recommendation setting out: 

*A Standard Shipping Mark* for marking on packages and for reproduction in documents.  

*Information Marks* for providing any necessary additional information on packages only.    

5. It was recognized that shipping marks are predominantly stipulated by importers. While this Recommendation is particularly directed at them – especially their purchase and documentary credit departments – it applies equally to others responsible for the marking, handling and documentation – for example, Government offices and agencies, international organisations, trading companies, manufacturers, export packers, warehousemen, freight forwarders, groupage and inland clearance depot operators, stevedores, port authorities, carriers by any mode of transport, as well as measuring and tallying institutions.    

### II  

####Scope

6. This Recommendation aims at establishing a standard consignment identifier in the form of a simplified and standardized shipping mark, for marking on packages and for reproduction in documents. It also aims at establishing rules for the use of information marks, although these are not part of this Recommendation.    

### III  

####Field of application

7. The Standard Shipping Mark established in this Recommendation should be used for marking on packages moved internationally by all modes of transport, for reproduction in related documents, and as data elements in trade data interchange.    

### IV  

####References

8. The following documents have been taken into account in the preparation of the present Recommendation:

### V  

####Standardized marks

####The Standard Shipping Mark

9. This Recommendation establishes a Standard Shipping Mark and sets out information marks.  

10. The Standard Shipping Mark is made up of the following four elements in the sequence indicated and should be shown both on packages and documents.    

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| --- |  *Example*   |
| --- | --- |
| (1) Initials or abbreviated name  | ABC  |
| (2) Reference number  | 1234  |
| (3) Destination  | BOMBAY  |
| (4) Package number  | 1/25  |

Any of the four elements which is considered unnecessary for a shipment may be omitted. Section VI below gives some examples of further simplified marks. 

(1) *Initials or abbreviated name of consignee or buyer:* name/address should not be shown in full except for rail transport, where the CIM Convention requires full address on all packages; this is conventional practice also for road transport. Note: exporters and importers could usefully agree on a set of initials/abbreviations to be used for all shipments between them. If an abbreviated name is preferred to initials, the consignees’/buyers’ name, as abbreviated in their telex answerback or cable address, could be used.  

(2) *Reference number:* should be as brief as possible to avoid confusion and mistranscription. Only the most important number of those available, e.g. shipment *or* order *or* invoice number as agreed between seller and buyer, should be shown. Such information as “Order No.” and the year and date accompanying numbers should be avoided.  

(3) *Destination:* The name of the port or place of ultimate destination of the goods (port of discharge, place of delivery, place of delivery by on-carrier) should always be shown. In case of trans-shipment during the transport, also the name of the port or place of trans-shipment can be indicated, preceded by VIA, e.g. NEW DELHI VIA BOMBAY. However, in multimodal/combined transport only the ultimate destination of the goods should be shown; this will permit the transport operator to send the goods by the preferred route (e.g. via Adelaide rather than Sydney) and will avoid interruption of the transport at the place of trans-shipment (e.g. goods marked CANBERRA VIA SYDNEY could be held for clearance at Sydney).  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Example:  | ABC  |
| --- | 1234  |
| --- | CANBERRA  |
| --- | 1/25  |

(4) *Package number.* The running number and, where known, the total number of packages or pieces should be indicated as, for example, 1/25, 2/25, and so on to 25/25. This is shown on documents as “1/25”, meaning “package number 1 of 25”. Such indications as “P/No.” need not be given.    

####Information Marks

11. Information Marks are not essential for delivery to destination; they are shown on packages (clearly separated from the Standard Shipping Mark), but do not form part of the shipping mark to be reproduced in documents.  

12. The *Gross Weight*, shown in kilograms, should be marked whenever it assists safe handling or (as for airfreight) correct stowage. It should be marked below the Standard Shipping Mark but separated from it; example 462KG. Information such as “GROSS/BRUTTO WEIGHT” need not be shown.  

13. Other details such as *Country of Origin* or *Import Licence No*. are sometimes required by government regulations or might facilitate Customs clearance. Details can also be included at the buyer’s request to facilitate sorting and redistribution of the goods. It is however not advisable to show the Sender’s name/address on packages if it increases the risk of pilferage. All such details should be well separated from the Standard Shipping Mark and be kept to an absolute minimum. They should be abbreviated as much as possible, for example IL GG22455 17067 2 instead of IMPORT LICENCE NUMBER. G/G22455-17067-2.  

14. It is normally not necessary to show *Net Weight* and *Linear Dimensions* on packages (although this is done conventionally on certain goods such as chemicals in drums or on very large packages); national and international regulations should, to the extend possible, not make such details mandatory. When required they can be abbreviated as, for example, N401KG 105 x 90 x 62CM.    

####Special notes on Standardized Marks

15.1. Shipping marks must not exceed ten lines of 17 characters per line. This is the maximum for documents and computer systems established in accordance with internationally recommended standards.  

15.2. Only characters which can be produced by typewriter and telex equipment or can be transmitted by electronic means should be used for the Standard Shipping Mark and Information Marks. These are the letters A to Z, the numerals 0 to 9, the space character and the following graphic characters: full stop [.], hyphen or minus [-], parenthesis [()], oblique stroke or slant [/] and comma [,]. Certain other graphic characters may be used as control characters within the UN/ECE trade data interchange syntax rules an should be avoided in shipping marks; they are the following: plus [+], colon [:], apostrophe [’], equals sign [=], question mark [?] and asterisk [*]. <sup> 1)  Noot redactie: hier wordt kennelijk het woord “and” bedoeld.  </sup>  

15.3. Geometric or other figures (e.g. diamonds, triangles, squares,) should not be used for the Standard Shipping Mark or Information Marks.  

15.4. Where the Standard Mark is required in more than one alphabet or language (e.g. Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese), at least one mark should be shown in the Roman alphabet. The other mark should be shown in brackets beside the first or on another side of the package (marks are shown on two sides of the individual packages of the shipment – see section VII). Only the mark in the Roman alphabet should be reproduced in documents. (These rules will not apply to Standard Shipping Marks shown on goods moving between countries where the Roman alphabet is not used.)  

15.5. Colour coding – such as the marking of green stripes or crosses – should be avoided whenever possible, and no reference in documents to such coding should be required.    

### VI  

####Simplified marking for different modes of transport

16. The Standard Shipping Mark can be simplified further for some modes of transport whereas Cargo Handling Marks – especially danger marks – must be shown in full. *Loose general cargo* in all modes of transport should be fully marked in accordance with section V. **Groupage cargo*.* Even if the groupage cargo makes the greater part of its journey in a container or a TIR trailer, handling at various groupage depots is necessary and individual parts of the shipment should be fully marked in accordance with section V. If a full container or trailer consigned by one shipper is broken down during transit for split deliveries, all parts should likewise be fully marked. **Full loads** (i.e. full container loads (FCL), trailers, wagons or airline ULDs containing goods sent from one shipper to one consignee): the Standard Shipping Mark can be simplified as follows: 

a. if the load is covered by a single set of documents and if packaging and contents are identical in every way – size, type, grade (for example, 50-kg bags of rolled oats or refined sugar), the Standard Shipping Mark should not be at all necessary;  

b. if the load is covered by more than one set of documents (e.g. two sets of invoices for accounting purposes) or comprises packages whose contents differ, only items 2 and 4 of the Standard Shipping Mark (Reference No. and Package No.) should be necessary to check goods against documents and for identification of the goods by Customs or consignee.  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
|  *Example:*   | 1234  |
| --- | 1/25  |

17. In any event, it must be possible to cross-reference packages to a comprehensive packing list for Customs examination and for purposes of sorting and redistribution.  

18. It should be noted that containers and trailers containing dangerous goods must bear on the outside the danger labels and other mandatory data such as correct technical name/proper shipping name of the contents. Similar rules apply to radioactive material.   

####Air freight, loose or consolidated cargo.

19. IATA Resolution 606 sets out the mandatory and optional content of shipping marks for air freight: 

a. The Standard Shipping Mark. The Air Waybill No., as a unique reference, replaces items 1 and 2 of the Standard Shipping Mark (Abbreviated Name and Reference Number); the three-letter IATA code can be used to shorten item 3 (Destination); item 4 remains unchanged.  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- |  *Example:*   | 015-12345675  |
| --- | --- | DEL  |
| --- | --- | 1/25  |

b. For consolidated (groupage) cargo, the House AWB No. can be shown at the end of the marks.  

c. Information Marks. IATA Regulations state that the gross weight may be shown below the shipping mark and the full consignee address must appear on at least one package.      

####Special notes on the Unique Identification Code methodology (UNIC)

20. Implementation by commerce, carriers and Governments of revised Recommendation No. 8 of the UN/ECE Working Party on Facilitation of International Trade Procedures, “Unique Identification Code methodology”, could further simplify shipping marks while enhancing the possibilities of using automated procedures, including electronic trade data interchange.  

21. The Unique Identification Code (UNIC) could be used to replace items 1 and 2 of the Standard Shipping Mark (Abbreviated Name and Reference Number) and link up with ADP systems in one or both countries.  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- |  *Example:*   | 16/128735258/B1928  |
| --- | --- | HELSINKI  |
| --- | --- | 1/25  |

22. Eventually, if a comprehensive ADP system existed for control of goods movements and transmission of information, and was used by the countries and carriers concerned in a particular goods movement, it would be possible to replace the Standard Shipping Mark entirely (except for item 4 – Package Number) with the UNIC.  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
|  *Example:*   | 16/128735258/B1928  |
| --- | 1/25  |

23. An interesting comparison may be made with the ADP methods used by containership operators to control and trace cargoes worldwide by sole use of the container number, e.g. ABCU 2128835, and those used by airlines with the Air Waybill No., e.g. 015-12345675.    

####Bar coding

24. When bar coding shipping marks, the maximum number of characters that can be encoded depends on several factors, primarily: the bar code printing technique, reading equipment and symbology. For companies or organizations wishing to bar code the Standard Shipping Marks it is important that the appropriate symbology and reading equipment are chosen.    

### VII  

####Methods of marking

####On documents

25. The United Nations Layout Key specifies a position for entering shipping marks, under the heading “Marks and Numbers”, in the following way:     ![10000053644](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053644)
Only the Standard Shipping Mark should be shown and *buyers should ensure that documentation instructions (in particular those given in documentary credits) do not call for any additional details to be shown under “Marks and Numbers”* other than the *Standard Shipping Mark*. The “Special notes on standardized marks” under section V should also be considered in this respect.  

####On cargo

26. The keywords for cargo marking are: Big, Bold and Brief.    

####The Standard Shipping Mark

a. should be marked centrally on two sides of the package or pallet load; loose cargo by conventional sea freight should be marked on the top also;  

b. should be in characters 5 cm high, but can be varied where necessary in proportion to the size of the package;  

c. should preferably be stencilled using black ink (or a colour contrasting with the background) which is waterproof, permanent and resistant to humidity and friction.   *Note 1* – If a felt-tip is used, the ink must be waterproof and permanent, as indicated on the barrel of suitable pens. Writing should be large, clear and in capital letters. *Note 2* – Fluorescent colours might be considered. Red should only be used for dangerous cargo. Some colours might merge with the background under fluorescent, mercury or sodium vapour lighting.  

####Information Marks should be well separated from the Standard Shipping Mark and should be shown in smaller characters or in a different colour.

####Special notes on methods of marking

27. Unpacked items, e.g. ironwork, should be marked with a metal tag, securely wired. Tie-on tags can be used for personal effects. Tags and tie-on labels should otherwise be avoided.   *Bales* should be marked on both sides. *Bags and sacks* should be marked on both sides with a marking fluid which impregnates the material. Where contents can sift through a material, such as Hessian, marking should be done before filling. *Drums* should be marked on the head (top) and side; the size of the characters on the head may be reduced because of the small area available for marking. *Carboys* should be marked with self-adhesive labels on two opposite sides. *Areas which will be covered by straps or bands* should not be marked.  *Old marks should be completely obliterated.*

####Algemene bepalingen

Overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het tweede lid van artikel V van het Verdrag beletten de bepalingen van de Bijlage het openbaar gezag niet de door dat gezag passend geoordeelde maatregelen te nemen, waaronder begrepen het vragen van nadere gegevens, hetgeen nodig zou kunnen zijn in gevallen waarin het vermoeden bestaat van fraude of in verband met problemen van bijzondere aard die een ernstige bedreiging vormen voor de openbare orde, de openbare veiligheid of de volksgezondheid, waaronder wederrechtelijke gedragingen gericht tegen de veiligheid van de zeescheepvaart en de illegale handel in verdovende middelen en psychotrope stoffen, of om het binnendringen of de verbreiding tegen te gaan van ziekten of plagen die schadelijk zijn voor dieren of voor planten. 

1.1 *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag eist in alle gevallen dat slechts essentiële gegevens worden verstrekt en houdt het aantal daarvan zo laag mogelijk. 

1.1.1 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou rekening moeten houden met de gevolgen die de introductie van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie zou kunnen hebben voor het vergemakkelijkingsproces, en zou deze samen met reders en alle andere betrokken partijen in overweging moeten nemen.   Bestaande informatievereisten en controleprocedures zouden moeten worden vereenvoudigd, en er zou aandacht besteed moeten worden aan de wenselijkheid van compatibiliteit met andere relevante informatiesystemen.  

1.2 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Niettegenstaande het feit dat in deze Bijlage documenten voor bepaalde doeleinden afzonderlijk kunnen zijn voorgeschreven en vereist, zou het openbaar gezag, daarbij rekening houdend met de belangen van hen die de documenten moeten invullen, alsook met het doel waarvoor zij moeten worden gebruikt, ervoor zorg moeten dragen dat in alle gevallen waarin zulks mogelijk is en de gang van zaken daardoor aanmerkelijk zou worden vergemakkelijkt twee of meer van dergelijke documenten tot een enkele worden verenigd.  

1.3 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Door de Verdragsluitende Regeringen opgelegde maatregelen en procedures ten behoeve van de veiligheid of het voorkomen van de handel in verdovende middelen dienen doelmatig te zijn en waar mogelijk gebruik te maken van informatietechnologie. Dergelijke maatregelen en procedures (bijv. risicobeheer en wederzijds controleren van informatie) dienen zodanig geïmplementeerd te worden dat de hinder voor schepen, personen of eigendommen aan boord tot een minimum wordt beperkt en onnodige vertragingen worden voorkomen.    

### C  

####Systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie

1.4.  *Norm.* Bij het invoeren van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van gegevens die door het openbaar gezag worden verlangd voor de aankomst, het verblijf en het vertrek van schepen, personen en lading teneinde in- en uitklaringsprocessen te vergemakkelijken, moedigen de Verdragsluitende Regeringen het openbaar gezag en andere betrokken partijen (reders, verladers, zeehavens en/of scheepsbevrachters, etc.) aan gegevens uit te wisselen overeenkomstig de relevante normen van de VN, met inbegrip van de VN/EDIFACT-normen (elektronische gegevensuitwisseling voor overheid, handel en vervoer).   
1.5.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt alle voor de in- en uitklaringsprocessen benodigde documenten in papieren vorm, wanneer deze met behulp van technieken voor gegevensverwerking op gewoon papier zijn vervaardigd, op voorwaarde dat zij leesbaar zijn, in overeenstemming met de documentopmaak zoals vervat in het Verdrag inzake het vergemakkelijken van het internationale verkeer ter zee zijn, en de benodigde informatie bevatten.   
1.6.  *Norm.* Bij het invoeren van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie ten behoeve van in- en uitklaringsprocessen, beperkt het openbaar gezag de informatie die wordt verlangd van reders en andere betrokken partijen tot hetgeen wordt vereist krachtens het Verdrag inzake het vergemakkelijken van het internationale verkeer ter zee.   
1.7.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bij het plannen, invoeren of wijzigen van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie ten behoeve van in- en uitklaringsprocessen, zou het openbaar gezag ernaar moeten streven: 

a. alle betrokken partijen vanaf het begin de gelegenheid tot overleg te geven;  

b. bestaande procedures te evalueren en de overbodige af te schaffen;  

c. vast te stellen welke procedures geautomatiseerd dienen te worden;  

d. de aanbevelingen van de Verenigde Naties (VN) en de relevante ISO-normen zo veel mogelijk navolging te geven;  

e. deze systemen geschikt te maken voor multimodaal vervoer; en  

f. passende stappen te nemen om de implementatiekosten van deze systemen voor operators en overige private partijen zo laag mogelijk te houden.     
1.7.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen dienen het openbaar gezag en overige betrokken partijen aan te moedigen samen te werken bij of rechtstreeks deel te nemen aan de ontwikkeling van elektronische systemen die gebruik maken van internationaal overeengekomen normen teneinde de uitwisseling van informatie inzake de aankomst, het verblijf en het vertrek van schepen, personen en lading te verbeteren en de interoperabiliteit tussen de systemen van het openbaar gezag en overige betrokken partijen te waarborgen.   
1.8.  *Norm.* Bij het invoeren van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie ten behoeve van in- en uitklaringsprocessen, moedigt het openbaar gezag het gebruik ervan door zeevaartondernemingen en andere betrokken partijen aan, maar beperkt het serviceniveau dat beschikbaar is voor ondernemingen die geen gebruik maken van dergelijke technieken niet.   
1.8.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen dienen het openbaar gezag aan te moedigen regelingen in te voeren die handelaren en vervoersondernemers met inbegrip van schepen in staat stellen alle informatie die door het openbaar gezag verlangd wordt in verband met de aankomst, het verblijf en het vertrek van schepen, personen en lading in te dienen bij een enkele ingang, waarbij dubbel werk wordt voorkomen.   

### D  

####Illegale handel in verdovende middelen

1.9.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou moeten streven naar samenwerkingsovereenkomsten met reders en andere betrokken partijen teneinde hun vermogen om drugssmokkel te bestrijden te verbeteren, en daarbij vergemakkelijking moeten aanmoedigen. Dergelijke overeenkomsten kunnen gebaseerd zijn op de Memoranda van Overeenstemming en de bijbehorende richtlijnen van de Internationale Douaneraad . <sup> 2)  Sinds 1994 bekend als de Werelddouaneorganisatie.  </sup>   
1.10.  *Norm.* Wanneer het openbaar gezag, reders en andere betrokken partijen in het kader van samenwerkingsovereenkomsten toegang krijgen tot gevoelige commerciële of andere informatie, wordt deze informatie vertrouwelijk behandeld.   

### E  

####Controletechnieken

1.11.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag maakt gebruik van risicobeheer ter verbetering van zijn grenscontroleprocedures met betrekking tot: 

* de vrijgave/in- en uitklaring van lading;  

* veiligheidsvereisten; en  

* zijn vermogen smokkel aan te pakken,   waardoor het rechtmatige vervoer van personen en goederen vergemakkelijkt wordt.   

### DEEL  2  

####AANKOMST, VERBLIJF EN VERTREK VAN HET SCHIP

Dit deel bevat de bepalingen betreffende de formaliteiten die door het openbaar gezag van de reders worden verlangd bij de aankomst, het verblijf en het vertrek van het schip; deze betekenen niet dat bepaalde certificaten en andere met het schip vervoerde papieren voor zover deze betrekking hebben op de registratie, de meting, de veiligheid en de bezetting van het schip en andere daarmee verband houdende gegevens niet aan de bevoegde autoriteiten zouden behoeven te worden overgelegd. <sup> 3)  Zie FAL.2/Circ.87-MEPC/Circ.426-MSC/Circ.1151.  </sup>  

### A

2.1.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou procedures moeten ontwikkelen om informatie die aan de aankomst en het vertrek voorafgaat te gebruiken om het verwerken van door het openbaar gezag verlangde informatie te vergemakkelijken ten behoeve van het versnellen van de daaropvolgende vrijgave/in- of uitklaring van lading en douaneformaliteiten voor personen.   
2.1.3.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De nationale wetgeving zou de voorwaarden moeten vaststellen voor het indienen van informatie die aan de aankomst en het vertrek voorafgaat. Wat betreft het tijdstip waarop de aan de aankomst voorafgaande informatie moet worden ingediend geldt dat dit normaliter niet ver voor het tijdstip waarop het schip het land van vertrek verlaat zou moeten liggen. De nationale wetgeving zou echter, in aanvulling op de basisregel, tevens uitzonderingen kunnen vaststellen indien de voor de reis benodigde tijd korter is dan waar de basisregel van uitgaat.   
2.1.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou niet de indiening van een afzonderlijke generale verklaring, aangifte van de lading, bemanningslijst en passagierslijst moeten verlangen indien de gegevens van deze documenten reeds in de aan de aankomst voorafgaande informatie zijn begrepen.   
2.1.5.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou:

2.2.3.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt dat de generale verklaring wordt gedateerd en ondertekend door de gezagvoerder, de scheepsagent of een andere persoon die daartoe door de gezagvoerder naar behoren is gemachtigd, dan wel wordt gelegaliseerd op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag.   
2.3.  *Norm.* De aangifte van lading is het basisdocument bij aankomst en vertrek dat de door het openbaar gezag verlangde gegevens met betrekking tot de lading bevat. Er kan echter worden verlangd dat bijzonderheden met betrekking tot een eventueel gevaarlijke lading afzonderlijk worden verstrekt.   
2.3.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag eist niet dat de aangifte van de lading meer bevat dan de volgende gegevens:

Dit internationaal verdrag trad op 1 januari 1988 in werking; het heeft tot doel een systeem voor omschrijving en codering in te stellen dat door douaneadministraties gebruikt kan worden bij het benoemen van artikelen of artikelgroepen ten behoeve van het vaststellen van douanetarieven en het verzamelen van statistische gegevens.  </sup>  

* transportdocumentnummers voor lading die in de desbetreffende haven moet worden gelost  

* havens waar de aan boord gebleven lading zal worden gelost

* transportdocumentnummers voor lading die in de desbetreffende haven is ingeladen.   *Noot:* Ten behoeve van een adequate omschrijving van het aantal en soort van de colli op de aangifte van de lading, zouden reders en andere betrokken partijen moeten waarborgen dat de buitenverpakking van de goederen wordt vermeld. Indien de goederen op pallets staan, zou het aantal en soort van de colli op de pallet(s) moeten worden vermeld. Indien de goederen op de pallet niet zijn verpakt, zou de hoeveelheid en de omschrijving van de goederen op de pallet moeten worden vermeld. *Noot:* Om de verwerking van de door het openbaar gezag verlangde gegevens te vergemakkelijken, zouden alle betrokken partijen een passende omschrijving van de goederen moeten gebruiken en zich moeten onthouden van het gebruik van generieke benamingen als „algemene lading”, „onderdelen”, etc.     
2.3.2.  *Norm.* Met betrekking tot de aan boord gebleven lading, verlangt het openbaar gezag slechts een globale opsomming van een zo klein mogelijk aantal belangrijke gegevens.   
2.3.3.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt dat de aangifte van de lading wordt gedateerd en ondertekend door de gezagvoerder, de scheepsagent of een andere persoon die daartoe door de gezagvoerder naar behoren is gemachtigd, dan wel wordt gelegaliseerd op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag.   
2.3.4.  *Norm.* In plaats van de aangifte van de lading aanvaardt het openbaar gezag een afschrift van het manifest van het schip, mits dit ten minste de gegevens bevat die overeenkomstig aanbevolen werkwijze 2.3.1 en norm 2.3.2 worden verlangd en mits ondertekend of gelegaliseerd en gedateerd overeenkomstig het bepaalde in norm 2.3.3.   
2.3.4.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag kan als alternatief voor norm 2.3.4 ook genoegen nemen met een afschrift van het overeenkomstig norm 2.3.3 ondertekende of gelegaliseerde, of voor eensluidend gewaarmerkte, vervoersdocument, indien de aard en hoeveelheid van de lading dit toelaten en mits alle gegevens die overeenkomstig aanbevolen werkwijze 2.3.1 en norm 2.3.2 worden verlangd en geïdentificeerd, voor zover deze niet in deze documenten voorkomen, eveneens op andere wijze worden verstrekt en naar behoren worden gewaarmerkt.   
2.3.5.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag keurt goed dat niet op het manifest vermelde pakketten in het bezit van de gezagvoerder op de aangifte van de lading worden weggelaten, mits bijzonderheden over deze pakketten afzonderlijk worden verstrekt. *Noot:* Bijzonderheden over niet op het manifest vermelde pakketten zouden moeten worden verstrekt op een afzonderlijk formulier en zouden relevante delen moeten omvatten van de gewoonlijk op de aangifte van de lading gegeven informatie. Daartoe zou het IMO-formulier voor de aangifte van de lading kunnen worden gebruikt, met een gewijzigde titel, die bijvoorbeeld zou kunnen luiden: „Lijst van niet op het manifest vermelde pakketten.”   
2.4.  *Norm.* De aangifte van de scheepsvoorraad is het basisdocument bij aankomst en vertrek dat de door het openbaar gezag verlangde gegevens met betrekking tot de scheepsvoorraad bevat.   
2.4.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt dat de aangifte van de scheepsvoorraad wordt gedateerd en ondertekend door de gezagvoerder of door een andere scheepsofficier die daartoe door de gezagvoerder naar behoren is gemachtigd en persoonlijk bekend is met de feiten die op de scheepsvoorraad betrekking hebben, dan wel wordt gelegaliseerd op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag   
2.5.  *Norm.* De aangifte van de persoonlijke eigendommen van de bemanning is het basisdocument dat de door het openbaar gezag verlangde gegevens bevat voor zover die betrekking hebben op de persoonlijke bezittingen van de bemanning. Bij vertrek wordt deze aangifte niet verlangd.   
2.5.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt dat de aangifte van de persoonlijke eigendommen van de bemanning wordt gedateerd en ondertekend door de gezagvoerder of een andere scheepsofficier die daartoe door de gezagvoerder naar behoren is gemachtigd, dan wel wordt gelegaliseerd op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag. Het openbaar gezag kan eveneens verlangen dat elk bemanningslid zijn handtekening plaatst onder de aangifte die betrekking heeft op zijn persoonlijke eigendommen, of zo hij die niet kan zetten, deze van zijn teken voorziet.   
2.5.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In de regel zou het openbaar gezag slechts gegevens moeten verlangen met betrekking tot de persoonlijke eigendommen van bemanningsleden die niet in aanmerking zouden komen voor vrijstelling van douanerechten en -heffingen of waarop verbodsbepalingen of beperkingen van toepassing zijn.   
2.6.  *Norm.* De bemanningslijst is het basisdocument dat het openbaar gezag verlangt en dat gegevens bevat die betrekking hebben op het aantal leden van de bemanning en de samenstelling van de bemanning bij aankomst of vertrek van een schip.

2.6.3.   *Niet in gebruik*    
2.6.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Indien de in norm 2.6.3 genoemde omstandigheden van toepassing zijn, maar er kleine veranderingen in de samenstelling van de bemanning hebben plaatsgevonden, zou het openbaar gezag in de regel niet moeten verlangen dat er een nieuwe, complete bemanningslijst wordt ingediend maar zou het de bestaande bemanningslijst met daarop aangegeven de wijzigingen moeten aanvaarden.   
2.7.  *Norm.* De passagierslijst is het basisdocument dat het openbaar gezag verlangt bij aankomst of vertrek van een schip en dat gegevens bevat met betrekking tot de passagiers.   
2.7.1.   *Niet in gebruik*    
2.7.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou naast de passagierslijsten geen inschepings- of ontschepingskaarten moeten verlangen met betrekking tot passagiers wier namen op die lijsten voorkomen. Indien het openbaar gezag evenwel met bijzondere problemen geconfronteerd wordt die een ernstige bedreiging inhouden voor de volksgezondheid, kan van een persoon op een internationale zeereis bij aankomst verlangd worden dat hij zijn adres van bestemming schriftelijk mededeelt.

* haven en datum van aankomst van het schip  

* transitpassagier of niet.     
2.7.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Een door de reders voor eigen gebruik opgestelde lijst zou moeten worden aanvaard in plaats van een passagierslijst, mits deze ten minste de overeenkomstig aanbevolen werkwijze 2.7.3. verlangde gegevens bevat en overeenkomstig de in 2.7.5 gegeven norm is gedateerd en ondertekend of gelegaliseerd.   
2.7.5.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt dat de passagierslijst wordt gedateerd en ondertekend door de gezagvoerder, de scheepsagent of een andere persoon die daartoe door de gezagvoerder naar behoren is gemachtigd, dan wel wordt gelegaliseerd op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag.

* plaats waar lading aan boord is gestuwd  

* Aanvullende informatie.     
2.9.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verlangt bij aankomst of vertrek van het schip geen andere schriftelijke verklaring met betrekking tot poststukken anders dan de verklaring vereist volgens het Algemeen Postverdrag, op voorwaarde dat laatstgenoemde verklaring ook daadwerkelijk wordt overgelegd. Bij het ontbreken van een dergelijk document dienen de poststukken (aantal en gewicht) te worden vermeld op de aangifte van de lading.   
2.10.  *Norm.* De maritieme gezondheidsverklaring is het basisdocument dat de door de havengezondheidsdienst verlangde gegevens bevat die betrekking hebben op de gezondheidstoestand aan boord van een schip gedurende de reis en bij aankomst in een haven.

2.12.1.  *Norm.* Er wordt geen nieuwe aangifte van de lading verlangd bij vertrek uit een haven met betrekking tot lading waarvoor reeds bij aankomst in die haven een aangifte is gedaan en die aan boord is gebleven.   
2.12.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bij vertrek zou geen afzonderlijke aangifte van de scheepsvoorraad moeten worden verlangd met betrekking tot scheepsvoorraad waarvoor reeds bij aankomst een aangifte is gedaan, noch met betrekking tot scheepsvoorraad die in die haven aan boord is genomen en gedekt is door een ander douanedocument dat daartoe in de betrokken haven is aangeboden.   
2.12.3.  *Norm.* In gevallen waarin het openbaar gezag gegevens verlangt omtrent de bemanning van een schip bij het vertrek daarvan uit de haven, wordt een van de afschriften van de bemanningslijst die bij aankomst waren aangeboden bij het vertrek aanvaard, op voorwaarde dat deze opnieuw is ondertekend door de gezagvoerder of door een door hem naar behoren gemachtigde scheepsofficier, en is aangetekend dat het aantal bemanningsleden of de samenstelling daarvan bij vertrek van het schip is veranderd of dat een dergelijke wijziging tijdens het verblijf van het schip in de haven niet heeft plaatsgevonden.   
2.13.   <sup> 5)  De 2.13-serie wordt gereserveerd voor toekomstig gebruik.  </sup>   

### E  

####Achtereenvolgens aandoen van twee of meer havens in dezelfde Staat

2.14.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Rekening houdend met de procedures die worden toegepast bij de aankomst van een schip in de eerste aanloophaven op het grondgebied van een Staat, zouden de formaliteiten en documenten die door het openbaar gezag worden verlangd in elke volgende aanloophaven in dat land die wordt aangedaan zonder dat eerst een haven in een ander land wordt aangedaan, tot een minimum moeten worden beperkt.   

### F  

####Gereedmaken van documenten

2.15.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Voor zover mogelijk zou het openbaar gezag de in deze Bijlage bedoelde documenten, behoudens het bepaalde in norm 3.7, moeten aanvaarden ongeacht de taal waarin de verlangde gegevens op die documenten worden verstrekt, met dien verstande dat het openbaar gezag het recht heeft een schriftelijke of mondelinge vertaling te verlangen in een van de officiële talen van het land of van de Organisatie, indien het dit nodig mocht oordelen.   
2.16.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt documenten die in een leesbare en begrijpelijke vorm worden aangeboden, met inbegrip van met de hand met inkt of onuitwisbaar potlood ingevulde of door middel van informatietechnologie geproduceerde documenten.   
2.16.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt een handtekening, wanneer vereist, die met de hand is gezet, in facsimile, geperforeerd, gestempeld of in symbolen is aangebracht, of op enige andere mechanische of elektronische wijze is gezet, indien een dergelijke aanvaarding niet onverenigbaar is met de nationale wetgeving. De legalisering van informatie die niet op papier wordt overgelegd, geschiedt op een wijze die aanvaardbaar is voor het desbetreffende openbaar gezag.   
2.17.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag van een land waarin een beoogde haven van aankomst is gelegen of waar goederen worden gelost of overgeslagen, mag niet verlangen dat een op het schip, de lading, de scheepsvoorraad, de passagiers of de bemanning betrekking hebbend document, als bedoeld in dit deel, wordt gelegaliseerd, geverifieerd, gewaarmerkt of vooraf door een van de buitenlandse vertegenwoordigingen wordt behandeld. Het voorgaande houdt niet in dat het overleggen van een paspoort of ander identiteitsbewijs van een passagier of bemanningslid voor het verkrijgen van een visum of voor soortgelijke doeleinden niet kan worden gevorderd.   

### G  

####Fouten in de documentatie en daarvoor geldende boeten

2.18.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag staat toe dat, zonder dat daardoor het schip wordt opgehouden, fouten in een document als bedoeld in deze Bijlage worden gecorrigeerd, ten aanzien waarvan het zich overtuigd heeft dat deze onopzettelijk zijn gemaakt, niet ernstig zijn, niet te wijten zijn aan herhaalde achteloosheid en niet zijn gemaakt met de bedoeling wetten of voorschriften te overtreden, mits deze fouten worden ontdekt voordat het document in zijn geheel wordt gecontroleerd en de correcties onmiddellijk kunnen worden aangebracht.   
2.19.  *Norm.* Indien fouten worden aangetroffen in documenten als bedoeld in deze Bijlage en deze documenten zijn ondertekend door of namens een reder of gezagvoerder, of anderszins gelegaliseerd, worden geen boeten opgelegd voordat men in de gelegenheid is gesteld het openbaar gezag ervan te overtuigen dat de fouten onopzettelijk zijn gemaakt, niet ernstig zijn, niet te wijten zijn aan herhaalde achteloosheid en niet zijn gemaakt met de bedoeling wetten of voorschriften van de havenstaat te overtreden.   

### H  

####Bijzondere faciliterende maatregelen voor schepen die een haven aandoen teneinde zieke of gewonde bemanningsleden, passagiers, op zee geredde personen of andere personen aan wal te laten gaan voor een spoedeisende medische behandeling

2.20.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verzoekt om medewerking van de reders teneinde te waarborgen dat, wanneer een schip dat een haven wil aandoen uitsluitend om zieke of gewonde bemanningsleden, passagiers, op zee geredde personen of andere personen aan wal te laten gaan voor een spoedeisende medische behandeling, de gezagvoerder het openbaar gezag zo vroeg mogelijk van dit voornemen in kennis stelt en daarbij zo veel mogelijk bijzonderheden vermeldt omtrent de ziekte of verwonding en de identiteit van de personen.   
2.21.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag stelt de gezagvoerder, indien mogelijk per radio, maar in elk geval langs de snelst mogelijke weg, voor aankomst van het schip in kennis van de documenten en procedures die nodig zijn om zieke of gewonde personen snel aan wal te brengen en het schip onverwijld te laten inklaren.   
2.22.  *Norm.* In het geval van een schip dat met dit doel een haven aandoet en onmiddellijk daarna weer wil vertrekken, verleent het openbaar gezag het schip voorrang bij het aanmeren indien de toestand van de zieke persoon of de omstandigheden op zee van dien aard zijn dat een veilige ontscheping niet mogelijk is op de rede of de aanvaarroute naar de haven.   
2.23.  *Norm.* In het geval van een schip dat met dit doel een haven aandoet en onmiddellijk daarna weer wil vertrekken, verlangt het openbaar gezag in de regel niet het overleggen van de in norm 2.1 genoemde documenten, uitgezonderd de maritieme gezondheidsverklaring en, indien onontbeerlijk, de generale verklaring.   
2.24.  *Norm.* Wanneer het openbaar gezag een generale verklaring verlangt, bevat dit document niet meer gegevens dan die vermeld in aanbevolen werkwijze 2.2.2 en, wanneer mogelijk, minder.   
2.25.  *Norm.* Wanneer het openbaar gezag controlemaatregelen met betrekking tot de aankomst van een schip toepast voorafgaand aan het aan wal brengen van zieke of gewonde personen, hebben een spoedeisende medische behandeling en maatregelen ter bescherming van de volksgezondheid voorrang boven deze controlemaatregelen.   
2.26.  *Norm.* Wanneer waarborgen of verbintenissen worden vereist ten aanzien van de kosten van behandeling of uiteindelijke verwijdering of repatriëring van de betreffende personen, wordt een spoedeisende medische behandeling niet tegengehouden of vertraagd terwijl deze waarborgen of verbintenissen worden verkregen.   
2.27.  *Norm.* Een spoedeisende medische behandeling en maatregelen ter bescherming van de volksgezondheid hebben voorrang boven enige controlemaatregel die het openbaar gezag kan toepassen op zieke of gewonde personen die aan wal worden gebracht.   

### DEEL  3  

####AANKOMST EN VERTREK VAN PERSONEN

Dit deel bevat de bepalingen die betrekking hebben op de door het openbaar gezag van bemanning en passagiers bij aankomst of vertrek van een schip verlangde formaliteiten.  

### A  

####Voorschriften en procedures bij aankomst en vertrek

3.1.  *Norm.* Een geldig paspoort is het basisdocument dat het openbaar gezag gegevens verstrekt met betrekking tot elk van de reizigers bij aankomst of vertrek van een schip.   
3.1.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen zouden er, voor zover mogelijk, door bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten mee moeten instemmen dat in plaats van paspoorten genoegen wordt genomen met officiële identiteitsbewijzen.   
3.2.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag treft voorzieningen waarbij paspoorten, of in plaats daarvan aanvaarde officiële identiteitsbewijzen, van de passagiers van een schip door de immigratieautoriteiten slechts een keer bij aankomst en een keer bij vertrek gecontroleerd behoeven te worden. Bovendien kan verlangd worden dat deze paspoorten of officiële identiteitsbewijzen worden overgelegd voor verificatie- of identificatiedoeleinden verband houdende met douane- en andere formaliteiten bij aankomst en vertrek.   
3.3.  *Norm.* Nadat paspoorten of in de plaats daarvan aanvaarde officiële identiteitsbewijzen individueel zijn overgelegd, geeft het openbaar gezag deze documenten na controle terstond weer terug in plaats van deze achter te houden als extra controle, tenzij er iets is dat de toegang van een passagier tot het grondgebied in de weg staat.   
3.3.1.  *Norm.* Elke Verdragsluitende Regering verzekert dat het openbaar gezag frauduleuze, vervalste of nagemaakte reisdocumenten van personen die niet toegelaten kunnen worden, in beslag neemt. Deze documenten worden uit de roulatie genomen en zo mogelijk teruggezonden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten. De Staat die een document uit de roulatie neemt, geeft in plaats van dat document een begeleidende brief af, en voegt daarbij een fotokopie van de vervalste reisdocumenten, indien beschikbaar, alsmede eventueel belangrijke informatie. De begeleidende brief en de bijlagen erbij worden afgegeven aan de exploitant die zorgt draagt voor de verwijdering van de persoon die niet toegelaten kan worden. De brief dient tot het verstrekken van informatie aan de autoriteiten op het transitopunt en/of het punt waar de betrokkene aan boord is gegaan. <sup> 6)  In aanhangsel 2 is een mogelijk format voor een begeleidende brief gegeven.  </sup> *Noot:* Bovenstaande norm mag niet zodanig worden uitgelegd dat hierdoor afbreuk wordt gedaan aan het recht van het openbaar gezag van de Verdragsluitende Regeringen om te bepalen of, afhankelijk van het afzonderlijke geval, het bezit van frauduleuze documenten op zichzelf al dan niet een reden vormt voor het weigeren van de toelating en voor de onmiddellijke verwijdering van het grondgebied van de betrokken Staat. Geen van de bepalingen van deze norm mag worden uitgelegd als zijnde in tegenspraak met het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties van 28 juli 1951 betreffende de status van vluchtelingen en die van het Protocol van de Verenigde Naties van 31 januari 1967 betreffende de status van vluchtelingen, waarin het uitzetten of het teruggeleiden van een vluchteling wordt verboden.   
3.3.2.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen moeten een persoon ter controle accepteren die van zijn punt van ontscheping is teruggezonden nadat hem de toegang is geweigerd indien deze persoon zich op hun grondgebied had ingescheept. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen mogen deze persoon niet terugzenden naar het land waar hem eerder de toegang was geweigerd. *Noot 1:* Deze bepaling is niet bedoeld om het openbaar gezag ervan te weerhouden personen wie de toegang is geweigerd en die zijn teruggezonden, aan nadere controles te onderwerpen teneinde vast te stellen of zij uiteindelijk kunnen worden toegelaten op het grondgebied van de Staat of maatregelen te nemen teneinde hen over te brengen, terug te zenden of uit te wijzen naar een Staat waarvan zij de nationaliteit bezitten of waarin zij worden toegelaten. Indien een persoon wie de toegang is geweigerd, zijn reisdocument heeft verloren of vernietigd, aanvaardt de betrokken Verdragsluitende Regering in plaats daarvan een document waaruit blijkt onder welke omstandigheden deze persoon zich heeft ingescheept of is aangekomen, welk document is afgegeven door het openbaar gezag van de Verdragsluitende Regering in het land waar deze persoon de toegang is geweigerd. *Noot 2:* Het bepaalde in deze norm of in noot 1 mag niet worden uitgelegd als in tegenspraak met het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties van 28 juli 1951 betreffende de status van vluchtelingen en van het Protocol van de Verenigde Naties van 31 januari 1967 betreffende de status van vluchtelingen, waarin het uitzetten of het teruggeleiden van een vluchteling wordt verboden.   
3.3.3.  *Norm.* Voordat passagiers en bemanning worden aanvaard teneinde te onderzoeken of zij kunnen worden toegelaten tot de Staat, blijven zij onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de reder vallen.   
3.3.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Na het aanvaarden van passagiers en bemanning voor onderzoek, hetzij voorwaardelijk hetzij onvoorwaardelijk en indien de betrokken personen onder fysiek toezicht van het openbaar gezag staan, zou het openbaar gezag voor hen verantwoordelijk moeten zijn tot het moment waarop zij worden toegelaten of hun de toegang wordt geweigerd.   
3.3.5.  *Norm.* De verplichting van een reder om een persoon buiten het grondgebied van een Staat te brengen, eindigt zodra die persoon definitief is toegelaten tot die Staat.   
3.3.6.  *Norm.* Wanneer een persoon de toegang is geweigerd, wordt de reder daarvan door het openbaar gezag, zonder onredelijke vertraging, op de hoogte gebracht, en geraadpleegd over de regelingen voor verwijdering. De reder is verantwoordelijk voor de kosten van verblijf en verwijdering van een persoon die niet kan worden toegelaten en de reder is, in het geval een persoon weer wordt overgedragen aan de reder, verantwoordelijk voor de onverwijlde verwijdering van deze persoon naar: 

* het land van inscheping; of  

* enige andere plaats waar de persoon wordt toegelaten.     
3.3.7.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen en de reders dienen voor zover mogelijk samen te werken om de geldigheid en de echtheid van de paspoorten en visa vast te stellen.   
3.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Noch van zich inschepende of zich ontschepende passagiers, noch van voor dezen optredende reders, mag het openbaar gezag schriftelijke gegevens verlangen, behalve die welke reeds aan hun paspoorten of officiële identiteitsbewijzen kunnen worden ontleend, tenzij deze gegevens nodig zijn voor het invullen van enig in deze bijlage bedoeld document.   
3.5.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In gevallen waarin het openbaar gezag aanvullende schriftelijke gegevens verlangt van zich inschepende of ontschepende passagiers, niet zijnde gegevens benodigd voor het invullen van enig in deze Bijlage bedoeld document, zou het zijn eisen tot nadere identificatie van de passagiers moeten beperken tot de in de aanbevolen werkwijze van 3.6 (inschepings-/ontschepingskaart) genoemde gegevens. Het openbaar gezag zou de inschepings-/ontschepingskaart wanneer deze door de passagier is ingevuld moeten aanvaarden en zou niet moeten verlangen dat deze kaart wordt ingevuld of gecontroleerd door de reder. Met leesbaar handschrift op de kaart zou genoegen moeten worden genomen, tenzij het gebruik van blokletters op de kaart wordt voorgeschreven. Van elke passagier mag slechts één exemplaar van de inschepings-/ontschepingskaart, eventueel met een of meer gelijktijdig gemaakte doorslagen, worden verlangd.   
3.6.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou niet moeten eisen dat de inschepings-/ontschepingskaart meer bevat dan de volgende gegevens: 

* achternaam  

* voornamen

* geboortedatum  

* geboorteplaats  

* beroep  

* haven van inscheping/ontscheping  

* geslacht  

* plaats van bestemming  

* handtekening.     
3.7.  *Norm.* In gevallen waarin van personen aan boord van een schip verlangd wordt dat zij aantonen beschermd te zijn tegen gele koorts, aanvaardt het openbaar gezag het internationale bewijs van inenting of herinenting in de vorm als bepaald in de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling.   
3.8.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het geneeskundig onderzoek van personen die zich aan boord van een schip bevinden of van personen die een schip verlaten zou in het algemeen moeten worden beperkt tot personen die uit een gebied komen dat besmet is met een van de ziekten waarvoor plaatsing in quarantaine is voorgeschreven gedurende de incubatieperiode van de betreffende ziekte (zoals bepaald in de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling). Een aanvullend geneeskundig onderzoek kan evenwel overeenkomstig de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling worden gevorderd.   
3.9.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In de regel zou het openbaar gezag de douanecontrole op de reisbagage van binnenkomende passagiers moeten uitvoeren door middel van steekproeven of door selectie. Schriftelijke verklaringen met betrekking tot reisbagage van de passagiers zouden zoveel mogelijk achterwege moeten blijven.   
3.9.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Indien enigszins mogelijk zou het openbaar gezag controle van de reisbagage van vertrekkende passagiers achterwege moeten laten, waarbij terdege rekening wordt gehouden met de mogelijke noodzaak passende veiligheidsmaatregelen op te leggen.   
3.9.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In gevallen waarin controle van de reisbagage van vertrekkende passagiers niet geheel achterwege kan worden gelaten, zou de controle in de regel door middel van steekproeven of door selectie moeten worden uitgevoerd.   
3.10.  *Norm*. Een paspoort of een identiteitsbewijs afgegeven in overeenstemming met de relevante ILO-verdragen, of een geldig en naar behoren erkend identiteitsbewijs voor zeevarenden, zijn de basisdocumenten die het openbaar gezag gegevens verstrekken met betrekking tot elk van de bemanningsleden bij aankomst of vertrek van een schip.   
3.10.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag eist niet dat het identiteitsbewijs voor zeevarenden meer bevat dan de volgende gegevens: 

* achternaam  

* voornamen  

* geboortedatum en -plaats  

* nationaliteit  

* uiterlijke kenmerken  

* foto (gewaarmerkt)  

* handtekening  

* (eventueel) einde van de geldigheidsduur  

* bureau van afgifte.     
3.10.2.  *Norm.* Indien een zeevarende als passagier met een bepaald vervoermiddel een land moet binnenkomen of verlaten: 

a. om zich naar zijn schip te begeven of over te gaan op ander schip;  

b. om zich op doorreis te begeven naar zijn zich in een ander land bevindend schip, of om te repatriëren, of voor enig ander doel dat de goedkeuring heeft van de overheid van het desbetreffende land,   aanvaardt het openbaar gezag in plaats van een paspoort een geldig identiteitsbewijs voor zeevarenden, wanneer dit document het opnieuw toelaten van de houder tot het land dat het document heeft uitgegeven waarborgt.   
3.10.3.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In de regel zou het openbaar gezag – met betrekking tot leden van de bemanning – geen overlegging moeten verlangen van de persoonlijke identiteitsbewijzen noch het verstrekken van gegevens als aanvulling op het identiteitsbewijs voor zeevarenden voor zover deze gegevens niet op de bemanningslijst zijn vermeld.

####Maatregelen ter vergemakkelijking van het in- en uitklaren van lading en bagage en de douanebehandeling van passagiers en bemanning

3.11.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou, met medewerking van de reders en de havenautoriteiten, passende maatregelen moeten nemen opdat de goede gang van zaken in de haven zodanig wordt bevorderd dat passagiers en bemanning de douanebehandeling snel kunnen voltooien en bagage snel kan worden in- of uitgeklaard. Tevens zou het openbaar gezag voldoende personeel ter beschikking moeten stellen en voor doelmatige installaties moeten zorgen, waarbij bijzondere aandacht wordt besteed aan voorzieningen voor het laden, het lossen en het transport van de bagage (waaronder begrepen het gebruik van mechanische transportsystemen). Tevens zou daarbij in het bijzonder gelet moeten worden op punten waar veelvuldig vertraging in het verwerken van de passagiers optreedt. Zonodig zouden voorzieningen moeten worden getroffen voor een beschutte doorgang tussen het schip en de plaats waar de passagiers en de bemanning worden gecontroleerd. Dergelijke voorzieningen en installaties zouden flexibel moeten zijn en uitgebreid moeten kunnen worden om verscherpte veiligheidsmaatregelen mogelijk te maken wanneer er sprake is van een hoger dreigingsniveau.   
3.11.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou: 

a. in samenwerking met de reders en de havenautoriteiten passende voorzieningen moeten treffen, zoals: 

i. een methode voor ononderbroken verwerking van de afzonderlijke passagiers en van hun bagage;  

ii. een systeem waardoor het de passagiers mogelijk wordt gemaakt hun gecontroleerde bagage gemakkelijk te identificeren en in ontvangst te nemen zodra deze bagage is neergezet op een plaats waar de passagiers ze weer kunnen afhalen;  

iii. het waarborgen dat er faciliteiten en diensten beschikbaar zijn die zijn aangepast aan de behoeften van ouderen en passagiers met een handicap;    

b. zich ervan moeten verzekeren dat de havenautoriteiten alle noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen zodat: 

i. de passagiers zich met hun bagage gemakkelijk en snel naar en van plaatselijke vervoermiddelen kunnen begeven;  

ii. indien bemanningen zich voor het vervullen van officiële plichten in een bepaald gebouw moeten melden, dat gebouw gemakkelijk toegankelijk is en, zo het meerdere gebouwen betreft, deze zo dicht mogelijk bij elkaar zijn gevestigd.       
3.11.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou moeten overwegen, als manier om snelle in- en ontscheping en snelle in- en uitklaring te verzekeren, het stelsel van het dubbele circuit in te voeren voor de in- en ontscheping van passagiers en de in- en uitklaring van hun bagage en hun particuliere wegvoertuigen. <sup> 7)  Verwezen wordt naar aanbevolen werkwijze 11 en aanhangsel II bij Bijlage F3 van de Overeenkomst van Kyoto.  </sup>   
3.12.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verlangt dat de reders zich ervan verzekeren dat het scheepspersoneel alle passende maatregelen neemt die de procedures bij aankomst van passagiers en bemanning helpen bevorderen. Deze maatregelen kunnen omvatten: 

a. het verstrekken aan het openbaar gezag van een bericht waarin het tijdstip van aankomst tevoren zo nauwkeurig mogelijk wordt geschat, gevolgd door kennisgeving van een eventuele wijziging in het tijdstip, en waarin de reisroute staat aangegeven voor zover dit van belang is voor de controle;  

b. het gereed hebben van de scheepsdocumenten voor onmiddellijke controle;  

c. het zorgen dat touwladders of andere middelen om aan boord van een schip te komen worden uitgebracht terwijl het schip onderweg is naar zijn ligplaats langs de kade of naar de rede; en  

d. het zorgen voor het snel en ordelijk verzamelen en opstellen van personen aan boord, voorzien van de nodige documenten, voor de controle, waarbij speciaal aandacht wordt geschonken aan het aflossen van leden van de bemanning die essentiële taken in de machinekamers of elders verrichten.     
3.13.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bij het invullen van documenten die betrekking hebben op passagiers en bemanning zou men de achternaam of -namen voorop moeten zetten. Wanneer zowel de achternaam van de vader als die van de moeder wordt gebruikt, zou de achternaam van de vader het eerst moeten worden vermeld. Wanneer voor gehuwde vrouwen zowel de achternaam van de man als die van de vrouw worden gebruikt, zou de achternaam van de man het eerst moeten worden vermeld.   
3.14.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag laat, zonder onredelijke vertraging, personen aanwezig aan boord van een schip toe voor een onderzoek om na te gaan of zij toegelaten kunnen worden tot de desbetreffende Staat.   
3.15.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze*. Het openbaar gezag zou de reders geen onredelijke of buitensporige boete moeten opleggen in het geval dat een controledocument in het bezit van een passagier door het openbaar gezag niet in orde wordt bevonden of wanneer de passagier om die reden niet tot de desbetreffende Staat kan worden toegelaten.   
3.15.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag moedigt reders aan bij het punt van inscheping voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen teneinde te waarborgen dat passagiers in het bezit zijn van de controledocumenten die worden voorgeschreven door de ontvangende Staten of Staten van doortocht.   
3.15.2.  *Norm.* Wanneer een persoon de toegang wordt geweigerd en hij wordt verwijderd van het grondgebied van de Staat, vormt dit voor de reder geen beletsel de kosten die uit het niet toelaten voortvloeien van een dergelijke persoon terug te vorderen.   
3.15.3.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Met het oog op het vergemakkelijken en bespoedigen van het internationale verkeer op zee zou het openbaar gezag gestandaardiseerde internationale tekens en symbolen die door de Organisatie zijn ontwikkeld of aanvaard in samenwerking met andere relevante internationale organisaties en die, voor zover mogelijk, bij alle vormen van vervoer gangbaar zijn, moeten implementeren in zeeterminals en aan boord van schepen of, daar waar dit niet onder zijn rechtsgebied valt, de verantwoordelijke partijen in zijn land moeten aanbevelen dit te doen.   

### C  

####Bijzondere voorzieningen voor het vervoer over zee van oudere of gehandicapte passagiers

3.16.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Er zouden maatregelen moeten worden genomen om te verzekeren dat alle noodzakelijke informatie over vervoer en veiligheid beschikbaar is voor passagiers die een verminderd gehoor of gezichtsvermogen hebben.   
3.17.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Voor oudere en gehandicapte passagiers die worden afgezet of opgehaald bij een havengebouw, zouden aparte punten moeten worden gereserveerd, zo dicht mogelijk bij de hoofdingang. Deze zouden duidelijk moeten worden aangegeven door middel van geschikte borden. De toegangsroutes zouden vrij van hindernissen moeten zijn.   
3.18.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Indien de toegankelijkheid van openbare diensten beperkt is, zou alles in het werk moeten worden gesteld om toegankelijke openbare vervoersdiensten te bieden tegen redelijke prijzen, door het aanpassen van bestaande en voorgenomen diensten, of door het bieden van bijzondere voorzieningen voor passagiers die verminderd mobiel zijn.   
3.19.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Er zouden geschikte voorzieningen moeten worden geboden, in havens en op schepen, al naargelang van toepassing, om de veilige inscheping en ontscheping van oudere en gehandicapte passagiers mogelijk te maken.   

### D  

####Faciliterende maatregelen voor cruiseschepen en passagiers van cruiseschepen

3.20.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag staat toe dat een cruiseschip per radio toestemming tot ontscheping wordt gegeven wanneer, op basis van de informatie die voorafgaand aan de aankomst is verstrekt, de gezondheidsdienst die zal worden aangedaan van mening is dat de komst van het schip niet tot gevolg zal hebben dat ziekten waarvoor quarantainevoorschriften gelden worden ingevoerd of verbreid.   
3.21.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze*. De generale verklaring, passagierslijst en bemanningslijst zouden bij cruiseschepen slechts bij de eerste haven van aankomst en laatste haven van vertrek van een land moeten worden verlangd, op voorwaarde dat de omstandigheden van de reis onveranderd zijn gebleven.   
3.22.  *Norm.* De aangifte van de scheepsvoorraad en de aangifte van de persoonlijke eigendommen van de bemanning worden slechts in de eerste haven van aankomst van een land verlangd.   
3.23.  *Norm.* Paspoorten en andere officiële identiteitsbewijzen blijven te allen tijde in het bezit van de passagiers van cruiseschepen.   
3.24.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Indien een cruiseschip minder dan 72 uur in een haven verblijft, zouden de passagiers van cruiseschepen geen visum moeten hebben, uitgezonderd in bijzondere omstandigheden zoals vastgesteld door het betrokken openbaar gezag. *Noot:* Met deze aanbevolen werkwijze wordt beoogd dat elke Verdragsluitende Staat dergelijke passagiers een formulier kan uitreiken, of bij aankomst van hen in ontvangst kan nemen, waarop staat aangegeven dat zij toestemming hebben het grondgebied te betreden.   
3.25.  *Norm.* Passagiers van cruiseschepen worden niet onnodig opgehouden door controlemaatregelen die het openbaar gezag verricht.   
3.26.  *Norm.* In de regel worden passagiers van cruiseschepen niet onderworpen aan een persoonlijk onderzoek door het openbaar gezag dat verantwoordelijk is voor immigratiecontrole, uitgezonderd voor zover nodig ten behoeve van de veiligheid, het vaststellen van de identiteit en het nagaan of zij toegelaten kunnen worden.   
3.27.  *Norm.* Indien een cruiseschip achtereenvolgens meer dan een haven aandoet in hetzelfde land, worden passagiers van cruiseschepen in de regel slechts in de eerste haven van aankomst en in de laatste haven van vertrek door het openbaar gezag gecontroleerd.   
3.28.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Teneinde een snelle ontscheping te vergemakkelijken zou de aankomstcontrole van passagiers van cruiseschepen, wanneer praktisch uitvoerbaar, uitgevoerd moeten worden aan boord voorafgaand aan de aankomst op de plaats van ontscheping.   
3.29.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Passagiers van cruiseschepen die in de ene haven ontschepen en in een andere haven in hetzelfde land weer inschepen, zouden van dezelfde faciliteiten gebruik moeten kunnen maken als passagiers van cruiseschepen die in dezelfde haven in- en ontschepen.   
3.30.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De maritieme gezondheidsverklaring zou de enige geneeskundige controle moeten zijn voor passagiers van cruiseschepen.   
3.31.  *Norm.* Het is toegestaan ten behoeve van passagiers van cruiseschepen voorraden van de belastingvrije winkels van het schip aan boord te houden tijdens het verblijf van het schip in de haven.   
3.32.  *Norm.* Van passagiers van cruiseschepen wordt in de regel niet verlangd dat zij een schriftelijke verklaring overleggen betreffende hun persoonlijke bezittingen. Voor artikelen waarmee een groot bedrag aan douanerechten en andere belastingen en heffingen is gemoeid, kan niettemin een schriftelijke verklaring en het stellen van zekerheid worden verlangd.   
3.33.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Passagiers van cruiseschepen zouden niet aan een valutacontrole moeten worden onderworpen.   
3.34.  *Norm.* Inschepings-/ontschepingskaarten zijn niet nodig voor passagiers van cruiseschepen.   
3.35.   *Niet in gebruik*    

### E  

####Bijzondere faciliterende maatregelen voor passagiers op doorreis

3.36.  *Norm.* Een passagier op doorreis die aan boord blijft van het schip waarop hij aankomt en vertrekt, wordt in de regel niet onderworpen aan een routinecontrole door het openbaar gezag, behalve voor veiligheidsdoeleinden.   
3.37.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Een passagier op doorreis zou toegestaan moeten worden zijn paspoort of ander identiteitsbewijs te houden.   
3.38.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Van een passagier op doorreis zou niet moeten worden verlangd dat hij een ontschepings-/inschepingskaart invult.   
3.39.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Een passagier op doorreis die vanuit dezelfde haven zijn reis voortzet op hetzelfde schip zou in de regel toestemming moeten krijgen om desgewenst tijdelijk aan land te gaan gedurende het verblijf van het schip in de haven.   
3.40.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Van een passagier op doorreis die vanuit dezelfde haven zijn reis voortzet op hetzelfde schip zou niet verlangd moeten worden dat hij een visum heeft, uitgezonderd in bijzondere omstandigheden zoals vastgesteld door het betrokken openbaar gezag.   
3.41.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Van een passagier op doorreis die vanuit dezelfde haven zijn reis voortzet op hetzelfde schip zou niet verlangd moeten worden dat hij een schriftelijke douaneaangifte overlegt.   
3.42.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Een passagier op doorreis die in de ene haven ontscheept en in een andere haven in hetzelfde land op hetzelfde schip weer inscheept, zou van dezelfde voorzieningen gebruik moeten kunnen maken als een passagier die in dezelfde haven op hetzelfde schip in- en ontscheept.   

### F  

####Faciliterende maatregelen voor schepen die wetenschappelijke diensten uitvoeren

3.43.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Een schip dat wetenschappelijke diensten uitvoert heeft tijdens de reis noodzakelijkerwijs personeel aan boord dat ten behoeve van deze wetenschappelijke diensten op het schip werkzaam is. Dergelijk personeel, indien als zodanig geïdentificeerd, zou tenminste even gunstige voorzieningen moeten worden toegekend als die worden toegekend aan de bemanningsleden van dat schip.   

### G  

####Overige faciliterende maatregelen voor buitenlanders die deel uitmaken van de bemanning van schepen die internationale reizen maken – walverlof

3.44.  *Norm.* Buitenlandse bemanningsleden krijgen van het openbaar gezag toestemming aan wal te gaan terwijl het schip waarmee zij aankwamen in de haven ligt, op voorwaarde dat de formaliteiten bij aankomst van het schip zijn vervuld en het openbaar gezag geen reden heeft toestemming aan wal te gaan te weigeren om redenen van volksgezondheid, openbare veiligheid of openbare orde.   
3.45.  *Norm.* Voor walverlof is een visum niet verplicht voor de bemanningsleden.   
3.46.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bemanningsleden, die voor verlof aan wal gaan of daarvan terugkomen, zouden in de regel niet moeten worden onderworpen aan een persoonlijke controle.   
3.47.  *Norm.* Voor walverlof is een speciale vergunning, bijvoorbeeld een walpas, niet verplicht voor bemanningsleden.   
3.48.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Indien bemanningsleden verplicht zijn een identiteitsbewijs bij zich te dragen wanneer ze voor verlof aan wal zijn, zouden deze documenten beperkt moeten zijn tot de documenten vermeld in norm 3.10.   
3.49.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou een systeem moeten ontwikkelen waardoor het de bemanning van schepen die regelmatig in hun havens aanleggen, mogelijk wordt gemaakt van tevoren toestemming te verkrijgen om tijdelijk aan wal te gaan. Wanneer een schip geen ongunstig dossier inzake personencontrole heeft en het ter plaatse wordt vertegenwoordigd door een reder, dan wel door een agent van de reder, met een goede reputatie, dient het openbaar gezag, na te hebben vastgesteld dat de inlichtingen die door het openbaar gezag worden verlangd voordat het schip binnenkomt, voldoende zijn, dit schip in de regel toestemming te verlenen rechtstreeks naar zijn aanlegplaats te gaan en het niet te onderwerpen aan nadere gebruikelijke immigratiecontroles, tenzij het openbaar gezag anders beslist.   

### DEEL  4  

####VERSTEKELINGEN

### A  

####Algemene beginselen

4.1.  *Norm.* De bepalingen van dit deel worden toegepast in overeenstemming met de internationale beginselen inzake bescherming als vervat in internationale instrumenten, zoals het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties betreffende de status van vluchtelingen van 28 juli 1951, en het Protocol van de Verenigde Naties betreffende de status van vluchtelingen van 31 januari 1967, en relevante nationale wetgeving. <sup> 8)  Daarnaast kan het openbaar gezag de niet-bindende conclusie van de Uitvoerende Commissie van de UNHCR inzake verstekelingen die asiel aanvragen (1988, nr. 53 (XXXIX)) in overweging nemen.  </sup>   
4.2.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag, havenautoriteiten, reders en hun vertegenwoordigers en gezagvoerders werken zoveel mogelijk samen teneinde te voorkomen dat verstekelingen aan boord komen en teneinde gevallen waarin dit wel is gebeurd voortvarend op te lossen en te verzekeren dat een spoedige terugzending of repatriëring van de verstekeling zal plaatsvinden. Alle passende maatregelen worden genomen om te voorkomen dat er situaties ontstaan waarin verstekelingen voor onbepaalde tijd aan boord moeten blijven.   

### B  

####Preventieve maatregelen

4.3.  Preventieve maatregelen aan boord en in de haven   
4.3.1.  Haven/terminalautoriteiten   
4.3.1.1.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen waarborgen dat in al hun havens maatregelen op het gebied van de benodigde infrastructuur alsmede operationele en veiligheidsmaatregelen getroffen worden teneinde te voorkomen dat personen die zich aan boord van schepen willen verbergen, zich toegang verschaffen tot haveninstallaties en schepen, en houden bij de ontwikkeling van deze maatregelen rekening met de omvang van de haven en het soort lading dat vanuit de haven wordt verscheept. Dit dient te geschieden in nauwe samenwerking met het desbetreffende openbaar gezag en de reders en instanties aan wal, teneinde te voorkomen dat in de desbetreffende haven(s) verstekelingen aan boord gaan.   
4.3.1.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bij operationele maatregelen en/of veiligheidsplannen zouden, onder andere, de volgende punten, waar van toepassing aan de orde moeten komen: 

a. regelmatig patrouilleren in de havengebieden;  

b. instellen van speciale opslagfaciliteiten voor lading waartoe verstekelingen zich gemakkelijk toegang kunnen verschaffen, en voortdurende bewaking van zowel personen als lading die deze gebieden binnenkomen;  

c. inspecties van opslagplaatsen en opslagterreinen;  

d. doorzoeken van de lading indien er duidelijke aanwijzingen zijn voor de aanwezigheid van verstekelingen;  

e. samenwerking tussen het openbaar gezag, reders, gezagvoerders en relevante instanties aan wal bij het ontwikkelen van operationele maatregelen;  

f. samenwerking tussen havenautoriteiten en andere relevante autoriteiten (bijv. politie, douane, immigratiediensten) teneinde mensensmokkel te voorkomen;  

g. ontwikkeling en uitvoering van overeenkomsten met stuwadoors en andere instanties aan wal die in nationale havens werkzaam zijn teneinde te waarborgen dat alleen personeel dat door deze instanties gemachtigd is, deelneemt aan het stuwen, laden en lossen van schepen of andere taken die betrekking hebben op de in de haven liggende schepen;  

h. ontwikkeling en uitvoering van overeenkomsten met stuwadoors en andere instanties aan wal teneinde te waarborgen dat hun personeel dat toegang tot het schip heeft gemakkelijk herkenbaar is, en dat een lijst wordt verstrekt van personen die tijdens de uitoefening van hun taken waarschijnlijk aan boord van het schip moeten komen; en  

i. aanmoediging van stuwadoors en andere personen die in het havengebied werkzaam zijn om de aanwezigheid van personen die kennelijk niet bevoegd zijn zich in het havengebied op te houden te melden aan de havenautoriteiten.     
4.3.2.  Reder/gezagvoerder   
4.3.2.1.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verplichten reders en hun vertegenwoordigers in de haven, de gezagvoerders en andere verantwoordelijke personen veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen die, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, voorkomen dat potentiële verstekelingen aan boord van een schip kunnen komen, of, indien verstekelingen daar toch in slagen, ervoor zorgen, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, dat zij worden ontdekt voordat het schip de haven verlaat.   
4.3.2.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer een schip een haven aandoet of gedurende het verblijf in een haven waar het risico bestaat dat verstekelingen aan boord komen, dienen de veiligheidsregelingen ten minste de volgende preventieve maatregelen te omvatten: 

– alle deuren, luiken en toegangsmiddelen tot ruimen of opslagplaatsen die niet worden gebruikt tijdens het verblijf van het schip in de haven, moeten zijn afgesloten;  

– toegangspunten tot schepen moeten tot een minimum worden beperkt en adequaat worden beveiligd;  

– zeewaarts van het schip gelegen gebieden moeten adequaat worden beveiligd;  

– er dient een adequate dekwacht te zijn;  

– inschepingen en ontschepingen moeten, wanneer mogelijk, door de bemanning of, na toestemming van de gezagvoerder, door anderen worden bijgehouden;  

– er moeten adequate communicatiemiddelen in stand worden gehouden; en  

– ’s nachts moet er adequate verlichting zijn zowel binnen als langs de romp.     
4.3.2.3.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verlangen dat schepen die gerechtigd zijn hun vlag te voeren, met uitzondering van passagiersschepen, bij vertrek uit een haven, waar het risico bestaat dat verstekelingen aan boord gaan, een grondig onderzoek hebben ondergaan in overeenstemming met een specifiek plan of schema, waarbij prioriteit wordt gegeven aan plaatsen waar verstekelingen zich zouden kunnen verbergen. Zoekmethoden die verborgen verstekelingen letsel kunnen toebrengen mogen niet worden gebruikt.   
4.3.2.4.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verlangen dat het gassen of verzegelen van schepen die gerechtigd zijn hun vlag te voeren pas mag plaatsvinden na een zo grondig mogelijk onderzoek van de te gassen of verzegelen ruimten teneinde te waarborgen dat er geen verstekelingen aanwezig zijn in die ruimten.   
4.3.3.  Nationale sancties   
4.3.3.1.  *Norm.* Waar van toepassing stellen de Verdragsluitende Regeringen, overeenkomstig hun nationale wetgeving, vervolging in tegen verstekelingen, voor de afvaart ontdekte verstekelingen en personen die verstekelingen helpen toegang tot schepen te verkrijgen.   

### C  

####Behandeling van de verstekeling aan boord

4.4.  Algemene beginselen – humane behandeling   
4.4.1.  *Norm.* Verstekelingen worden behandeld in overeenstemming met humanitaire beginselen, met inbegrip van die genoemd in norm 4.1. Er moet naar behoren rekening worden gehouden met de operationele veiligheid van het schip en de veiligheid en het welzijn van de verstekeling.   
4.4.2.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verlangen dat de gezagvoerders van schepen die gerechtigd zijn hun vlag te voeren, passende maatregelen nemen om de beveiliging, algemene gezondheid, welzijn en veiligheid van de verstekeling te waarborgen tijdens zijn/haar verblijf aan boord, met inbegrip van het verstrekken van voldoende voedsel, accommodatie, goede medische zorg en sanitaire faciliteiten.   
4.5.  Werk aan boord   
4.5.1.  *Norm.* Verstekelingen worden niet verplicht werk te verrichten aan boord van het schip, behalve in noodsituaties of in verband met hun accommodatie aan boord.   
4.6.  Ondervraging en kennisgeving door de gezagvoerder   
4.6.1.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verlangen dat de gezagvoerders alle mogelijke inspanningen verrichten om de identiteit, met inbegrip van nationaliteit/staatsburgerschap, van de verstekeling en de haven waar deze aan boord is gegaan vast te stellen, en de aanwezigheid van de verstekeling tezamen met relevante gegevens te melden aan het openbaar gezag van de eerstvolgende geplande aanloophaven. Deze informatie wordt tevens verstrekt aan de reder, het openbaar gezag van de haven van inscheping, de vlaggenstaat en alle volgende aanloophavens indien van toepassing.   
4.6.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Bij het vergaren van relevante gegevens ten behoeve van de kennisgeving zou de gezagvoerder gebruik moeten maken van het formulier als opgenomen in Aanhangsel 3.   
4.6.3.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen instrueren de gezagvoerders van schepen die gerechtigd zijn hun vlag te voeren dat wanneer een verstekeling verklaart een vluchteling te zijn, deze informatie vertrouwelijk moet worden behandeld voor zover nodig voor de veiligheid van de verstekeling.   
4.7.  Kennisgeving aan de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie   
4.7.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou alle gevallen waarin verstekelingen zijn aangetroffen moeten melden aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie.   

### D  

####Afwijking van de geplande route

4.8.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag dringt er bij alle reders van schepen die gerechtigd zijn de vlag van zijn Staat te voeren op aan hun gezagvoerders te instrueren dat zij, nadat het schip de territoriale wateren van het land waar de verstekeling aan boord is gekomen heeft verlaten, niet van de geplande reis afwijken teneinde te trachten aan boord ontdekte verstekelingen te laten ontschepen, tenzij: 

– het openbaar gezag van de Staat naar wiens haven het schip uitwijkt toestemming heeft gegeven om de verstekeling te laten ontschepen; of  

– elders repatriëring is geregeld, met inbegrip van voldoende documentatie en toestemming voor ontscheping; of  

– er verzachtende omstandigheden zijn met betrekking tot veiligheid of gezondheid of vanwege humanitaire redenen.     

### E  

####Ontscheping en terugzending van een verstekeling

4.9.  De Staat van de eerste aanloophaven volgens het reisplan   
4.9.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag in het land van de eerste geplande aanloophaven van het schip na de ontdekking van een verstekeling beslist in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving of de verstekeling tot die Staat kan worden toegelaten.   
4.9.2.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag in het land van de eerste geplande aanloophaven van het schip na de ontdekking van een verstekeling staat ontscheping van de verstekeling toe wanneer de verstekeling in het bezit is van voor de terugkeer geldige reisdocumenten, en het openbaar gezag ervan overtuigd is dat tijdige regelingen voor de repatriëring zijn of zullen worden getroffen en dat aan alle vereisten voor de doortocht is voldaan.   
4.9.3.  *Norm.* Wanneer van toepassing en in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving, staat het openbaar gezag in het land van de eerste geplande aanloophaven van het schip na de ontdekking van een verstekeling de ontscheping van de verstekeling toe wanneer het openbaar gezag ervan overtuigd is dat het openbaar gezag of de reder geldige reisdocumenten zullen verkrijgen, tijdig regelingen voor de repatriëring van de verstekeling treffen en dat aan alle vereisten voor de doortocht zal worden voldaan. Daarnaast neemt het openbaar gezag de ontscheping van de verstekeling welwillend in overweging wanneer het niet mogelijk is de verstekeling te verwijderen van het schip waarmee hij/zij is aangekomen of wanneer er andere factoren zijn die verwijdering van het schip zouden verhinderen. Deze factoren omvatten, maar zijn niet beperkt tot de volgende: 

– een zaak is nog niet opgelost op het tijdstip waarop het schip uitvaart; of  

– de aanwezigheid aan boord van de verstekeling brengt de veilige exploitatie van het schip of de gezondheid van de bemanning of de verstekeling in gevaar.     
4.10.  Volgende aanloophavens   
4.10.1.  *Norm.* Wanneer ontscheping van een verstekeling in de eerste geplande aanloophaven na de ontdekking van de verstekeling niet geslaagd is, onderzoekt het openbaar gezag van de volgende aanloophavens of de verstekeling van boord kan gaan in overeenstemming met de normen 4.9.1, 4.9.2 en 4.9.3.   
4.11.  Nationaliteit van of recht op verblijf in een Staat   
4.11.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag aanvaardt in overeenstemming met het internationale recht de terugkeer van verstekelingen die de nationaliteit of het staatsburgerschap van zijn Staat bezitten of aanvaardt de terugkeer van verstekelingen die in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving recht hebben op verblijf in zijn Staat.   
4.11.2.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verleent wanneer mogelijk assistentie bij het vaststellen van de identiteit en de nationaliteit of het staatsburgerschap van verstekelingen die beweren onderdaan te zijn van of recht te hebben op verblijf in zijn Staat.   
4.12.  Staat van inscheping   
4.12.1.  *Norm.* Wanneer ten genoegen van het openbaar gezag is vastgesteld dat verstekelingen in een haven in zijn Staat aan boord van een schip zijn gegaan, aanvaardt het openbaar gezag ten behoeve van onderzoek dergelijke verstekelingen die van het punt van ontscheping zijn teruggezonden nadat hun daar de toegang was geweigerd. Het openbaar gezag van de Staat van inscheping stuurt dergelijke verstekelingen niet terug naar het land waar hun eerder de toegang was geweigerd.   
4.12.2.  *Norm.* Wanneer ten genoegen van het openbaar gezag is vastgesteld dat voor de afvaart ontdekte verstekelingen in een haven in zijn Staat aan boord van een schip zijn gegaan, aanvaardt het openbaar gezag de ontscheping van voor de afvaart ontdekte verstekelingen en van verstekelingen die aan boord van het schip worden ontdekt terwijl dit zich nog in de territoriale wateren bevindt of indien van toepassing in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving van die Staat op het gebied van rechtsmacht inzake immigratie. Aan de reder worden geen boetes of heffingen opgelegd in verband met de kosten van vasthouding of verwijdering.   
4.12.3.  *Norm.* Wanneer een voor de afvaart ontdekte verstekeling niet in de haven van inscheping van boord is gegaan, wordt hij/zij als een verstekeling behandeld in overeenstemming met de regels in dit deel.   
4.13.  De vlaggenstaat   
4.13.1.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag van de vlaggenstaat van het schip assisteert en werkt samen met de gezagvoerder/reder of het desbetreffende openbaar gezag in de aanloophavens bij: 

– het identificeren van de verstekeling en het vaststellen van zijn/haar nationaliteit;  

– het afleggen van verklaringen aan het relevante openbaar gezag om te helpen bij de verwijdering van de verstekeling van het schip op het eerste moment waarop dit mogelijk is; en  

– het treffen van maatregelen voor de verwijdering of repatriëring van de verstekeling.     
4.14.  Terugzending van verstekelingen   
4.14.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer een verstekeling niet over adequate documenten beschikt, zou het openbaar gezag, wanneer uitvoerbaar en voor zover in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving en veiligheidseisen, een begeleidend schrijven moeten afgeven met een foto van de verstekeling en andere belangrijke informatie. Dit schrijven, waarin toestemming wordt verleend voor de terugzending, met elk transportmiddel, van de verstekeling naar ofwel zijn/haar land van herkomst ofwel het punt waar de verstekeling zijn/haar reis begon, naargelang van toepassing, en waarin overige door het gezag gestelde voorwaarden staan vermeld, dient te worden overhandigd aan de onderneming die zorg draagt voor de verwijdering van de verstekeling. Dit schrijven bevat informatie die gevraagd wordt door de autoriteiten op de transitopunten en/of het punt waar de verstekeling van boord gaat.   
4.14.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag in de Staat waar de verstekeling van boord is gegaan zou met het desbetreffende openbaar gezag op de transitopunten tijdens de terugkeer van een verstekeling contact moeten opnemen, teneinde informatie te verstrekken omtrent de status van de verstekeling. Daarnaast zou het openbaar gezag in de transitolanden tijdens de terugzending van een verstekeling moeten toestaan, met inachtneming van hun normale visavereisten en nationale veiligheidsvereisten, dat de doortocht plaatsvindt via hun havens en luchthavens met betrekking tot verstekelingen die reizen ingevolge een bevel tot verwijdering of op last van het openbaar gezag van het land van de haven van ontscheping.   
4.14.3.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer een havenstaat de ontscheping van een verstekeling heeft geweigerd zou deze Staat, zonder onnodige vertraging, de vlaggenstaat van het schip dat de verstekeling vervoert op de hoogte moeten stellen van de redenen voor de weigering van de ontscheping.   
4.15.  Kosten van de terugzending en de verzorging van verstekelingen   
4.15.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag van de Staat waar een verstekeling van boord is gegaan zou in de regel de reder op wiens schip de verstekeling is aangetroffen, of diens vertegenwoordiger, voor zover mogelijk op de hoogte moeten stellen van de kosten van het vasthouden en terugzenden van de verstekeling, indien de reder deze kosten moet dragen. Daarnaast zou het openbaar gezag dergelijke kosten tot een minimum moeten beperken, voor zover uitvoerbaar en in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving, indien de reder deze kosten moet dragen.   
4.15.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het tijdvak gedurende welke het openbaar gezag van de Staat waar de verstekeling van boord is gegaan reders aansprakelijk kan stellen voor de kosten van de verzorging van een verstekeling, zou tot een minimum moeten worden beperkt.   
4.15.3.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag overweegt, in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving, de boetes te matigen die worden opgelegd aan schepen waarvan de gezagvoerder de aanwezigheid van een verstekeling op de juiste wijze heeft gemeld aan de desbetreffende autoriteiten in de haven van aankomst en heeft aangetoond dat alle redelijke preventieve maatregelen zijn genomen om te voorkomen dat verstekelingen aan boord van het schip kunnen komen.   
4.15.4.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou, in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving, moeten overwegen de andere heffingen die voor het overige van toepassing zouden kunnen zijn te matigen wanneer reders hebben samengewerkt met de toezichthoudende autoriteiten, ten genoegen van deze autoriteiten, bij het nemen van maatregelen gericht op het voorkomen van het vervoer van verstekelingen.   

### DEEL  5  

####AANKOMST, VERBLIJF EN VERTREK VAN LADING EN ANDERE ARTIKELEN

Dit deel bevat de bepalingen die betrekking hebben op de door het openbaar gezag van de reder, zijn agent of de gezagvoerder van het schip verlangde formaliteiten.  

### A  

####Algemeen

5.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou, met medewerking van de reders en de havenautoriteiten, de daarvoor in aanmerking komende maatregelen moeten nemen opdat het aantal ligdagen tot een minimum wordt beperkt en zou de nodige maatregelen moeten treffen die een goede gang van zaken in de haven bevorderen. Ook zou het openbaar gezag regelmatig alle werkwijzen opnieuw moeten bezien die verband houden met de aankomst en het vertrek van schepen, waaronder begrepen voorzieningen ten aanzien van de inscheping en de ontscheping, het laden en lossen, het onderhoud en dergelijke, alsmede de daarmee verband houdende veiligheidsmaatregelen. Tevens zou het openbaar gezag voorzieningen moeten treffen opdat de in- en uitklaring van vrachtschepen en hun lading voor zover mogelijk, geschiedt ter plaatse waar het schip gelost en geladen wordt.   
5.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou met medewerking van de reders en de havenautoriteiten, passende maatregelen moeten nemen, die een goede gang van zaken in de haven bevorderen zodat het laden en lossen en het in- en uitklaren van lading vlot en eenvoudig verlopen. Deze voorzieningen zouden zich – vanaf het tijdstip waarop het schip in de haven aankomt – moeten uitstrekken over alle fasen, te weten het lossen en de in- en uitklaring door het openbaar gezag, en zonodig de opslag en doorzending van de lading. Er dient een gemakkelijke en rechtstreekse verbinding te zijn tussen het pakhuis en het gebied waar de in- en uitklaring door het openbaar gezag plaatsvindt, die beide in de onmiddellijke omgeving van het havengebied zouden moeten zijn; indien mogelijk zouden mechanische transportsystemen aanwezig moeten zijn.   
5.3.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou eigenaren en/of exploitanten van terminals voor zeevracht moeten aanmoedigen deze te voorzien van opslagfaciliteiten voor bijzondere lading (bijv. waardevolle goederen, aan bederf onderhevige zendingen, stoffelijke overschotten, radioactieve of andere gevaarlijke stoffen, alsmede levende have) al naargelang van toepassing; de gedeelten van de terminals voor zeevracht waarin algemene en bijzondere lading en poststukken voorafgaand aan vervoer over zee of invoer worden opgeslagen, moeten te allen tijde worden beschermd tegen toegang door onbevoegden.   
5.4.  *Norm.* Een Verdragsluitende Regering die vergunningen of certificaten voor export, import of overslag verplicht blijft stellen voor bepaalde soorten goederen, stelt eenvoudige procedures in voor het snel verkrijgen of verlengen van dergelijke vergunningen of certificaten.   
5.5.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer een zending van dien aard is dat deze gemeld zou moeten worden aan verschillende instanties die bevoegd zijn inspecties uit te voeren, bijvoorbeeld douane-, veterinaire of gezondheidsdiensten, zouden de Verdragsluitende Regeringen deze bevoegdheid voor het uitvoeren van de vereiste inspecties moeten verlenen aan de douane of aan een van de andere instanties of, indien dit niet haalbaar is, alle stappen moeten nemen die nodig zijn om te waarborgen dat deze in- en uitklaring gelijktijdig op één locatie en met een minimum aan vertraging wordt uitgevoerd.   
5.6.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou moeten voorzien in vereenvoudigde procedures voor de snelle in- en uitklaring van particuliere pakketten met geschenken en van handelsmonsters tot een bepaalde waarde of kwaliteit, die op een zo hoog mogelijk niveau zou moeten worden gesteld.   

### B  

####De in- en uitklaring van lading

5.7.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verleent, behoudens de naleving van nationale verboden of beperkingen en vereiste maatregelen voor de veiligheid van havens of het voorkomen van de handel in verdovende middelen, voorrang aan de inklaring van levende have, bederfelijke goederen en overige zendingen van spoedeisende aard.   
5.7.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Teneinde de kwaliteit van de goederen die op in- of uitklaring wachten te beschermen, zou het openbaar gezag, in samenwerking met alle betrokken partijen, alle maatregelen moeten nemen om de praktische, veilige en betrouwbare opslag van goederen in de haven mogelijk te maken.   
5.8.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen zouden de tijdelijke toelating moeten vergemakkelijken van gespecialiseerde laad- en losapparatuur die per schip arriveert en die in de aanloophavens aan wal wordt gebruikt voor het laden, lossen en verwerken van lading.   
5.9.  Gereserveerd.   
5.10.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou procedures moeten ontwikkelen voor de in- en uitklaring van lading gebaseerd op de relevante bepalingen van en richtlijnen behorende bij de Internationale Overeenkomst inzake de vereenvoudiging en harmonisatie van douaneprocedures – de herziene Overeenkomst van Kyoto.   
5.10.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou de invoering van vereenvoudigde procedures voor bevoegde personen moeten overwegen waardoor het volgende wordt toegestaan: 

a. vrijgave van goederen na het verstrekken van de informatie die minimaal benodigd is om de goederen te kunnen identificeren, om de risico’s met betrekking tot gezondheid en veiligheid goed te kunnen identificeren en te beoordelen en om de daaropvolgende invulling van de uiteindelijke goederenaangifte mogelijk te maken;  

b. vrijgave van de goederen op de locatie van de aangever of op een andere door het desbetreffende openbaar gezag goedgekeurde locatie; en  

c. indiening van een enkele goederenaangifte voor alle invoeren of uitvoeren in een gegeven tijdvak wanneer de goederen regelmatig door dezelfde persoon worden in- of uitgevoerd.     
5.11.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag beperkt fysieke interventies tot het minimum dat nodig is om naleving van de wet te waarborgen.   
5.12.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Voor zover de middelen het toestaan, zou het openbaar gezag, op grond van een redelijk verzoek, de lading aan een fysiek onderzoek moeten onderwerpen, waar nodig, op het punt waar de lading in het transportmiddel wordt geladen en gedurende het laden, hetzij in de haven, hetzij, in het geval van vrachteenheden, op de plaats waar de container wordt geladen en verzegeld.   
5.13.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag waarborgt dat de vereisten voor het verzamelen van statistische gegevens de doelmatigheid van de handel over zee niet significant verminderen.   
5.14.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou gebruik moeten maken van systemen voor de elektronische uitwisseling van informatie teneinde informatie te verkrijgen met het oog op het versnellen en vereenvoudigen van in- en uitklaringsprocessen.   
5.14.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou ernaar moeten streven de douaneprocedure waaronder goederen afkomstig van een andere Staat vallen die in afwachting van het laden zijn, snel te laten verlopen.   

### C  

####Containers en pallets

5.15.  *Norm.* Met inachtneming van zijn respectieve regelgeving staat het openbaar gezag toe dat containers en pallets tijdelijk worden ingevoerd zonder betaling van douanerechten en andere belastingen en heffingen en vergemakkelijkt het gebruik ervan in het verkeer ter zee.   
5.16.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou in de in norm 5.15 bedoelde regelgeving de aanvaarding moeten voorzien van een eenvoudige aangifte waarin staat vermeld dat de tijdelijk ingevoerde containers en pallets binnen de door de betrokken Staat gestelde tijdsspanne weer worden uitgevoerd.   
5.17.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag staat toe dat containers en pallets die het grondgebied van een Staat krachtens de bepalingen van norm 5.15 binnenkomen, het terrein van de haven van aankomst verlaten voor de inklaring van ingevoerde lading en/of laden van uit te voeren lading volgens vereenvoudigde controleprocedures en met een minimum aan documentatie.   
5.18.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen staan de tijdelijke invoer toe van samenstellende delen van containers zonder betaling van douanerechten en andere belastingen en heffingen, indien deze delen benodigd zijn voor de reparatie van containers die reeds zijn toegelaten krachtens de bepalingen van norm 5.15.   

### D  

####Lading die niet wordt gelost in de haven van bestemming

5.19.  *Norm.* In geval lading voorkomend op de aangifte van de lading niet wordt gelost in de haven van bestemming, stemt het openbaar gezag in met een wijziging van de aangifte van de lading en legt het geen boete op indien het ervan overtuigd is dat de lading in werkelijkheid niet in het schip is geladen of, indien zij daarin wel is geladen, in een andere haven is gelost.   
5.20.  *Norm.* Indien als gevolg van een vergissing of om een andere geldige reden lading wordt gelost in een haven niet zijnde de haven van bestemming, bevordert het openbaar gezag de doorzending daarvan naar de haven van bestemming. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing op gevaarlijke of verboden lading of op lading ten aanzien waarvan beperkende bepalingen gelden.   

### E  

####Beperking van de verantwoordelijkheid van de reder

5.21.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verlangt niet van een reder dat deze bijzondere gegevens ten behoeve van dat gezag op een vervoersdocument of een afschrift daarvan vermeldt, tenzij de reder zelf de importeur of exporteur is of namens deze optreedt.   
5.22.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag stelt de reder niet aansprakelijk voor het aanbieden of de nauwkeurigheid van documenten die de importeur of exporteur zou moeten overleggen in verband met de in- of uitklaring van de lading, tenzij de reder de importeur of exporteur is, of namens deze optreedt.   

### DEEL  6  

####VOLKSGEZONDHEID EN QUARANTAINE MET INBEGRIP VAN GEZONDHEIDSVOORSCHRIFTEN VOOR DIEREN EN PLANTEN

6.1 *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag van een Staat die geen partij is bij de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling streeft ernaar de betreffende bepalingen van deze Regeling toe te passen op het internationale verkeer ter zee.  

6.2 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Verdragsluitende Regeringen die bepaalde belangen gemeen hebben op het gebied van de volksgezondheid of ten aanzien van de geografische, sociale of economische omstandigheden zouden ingevolge artikel 85 van de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling bijzondere voorzieningen moeten treffen, indien dergelijke voorzieningen de toepassing van die regeling zouden vergemakkelijken.  

6.3 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer met betrekking tot zendingen van bepaalde dieren, planten of daarvan vervaardigde producten gezondheidscertificaten of soortgelijke documenten worden vereist, zouden deze certificaten en documenten in eenvoudige termen moeten zijn gesteld en zou hieraan ruime bekendheid moeten worden gegeven, en de Verdragsluitende Regeringen zouden moeten samenwerken met de bedoeling deze voorschriften te standaardiseren.  

6.4 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Voor zover mogelijk zou het openbaar gezag een schip per radio toestemming tot ontscheping moeten verlenen wanneer, op basis van gegevens ontvangen vóór de aankomst van het schip, de gezondheidsdienst van de haven die zal worden aangedaan van mening is dat de komst van het schip niet tot gevolg zal hebben dat ziekten waarvoor quarantainevoorschriften gelden worden ingevoerd of verbreid. Voor zover mogelijk zou de gezondheidsdienst moeten worden toegestaan een schip te betreden alvorens dit schip de haven binnenloopt. 

6.4.1 *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag verzekert zich van de medewerking van de reders opdat voldaan wordt aan elk voorschrift dat ziekte aan boord van een schip onverwijld per radio moet worden gemeld aan de gezondheidsdienst van de haven waarheen het schip onderweg is, zodat de aanwezigheid van speciaal medisch personeel en apparatuur nodig voor de met de gezondheid verband houdende procedures gemakkelijk kan worden geregeld.    

6.5 *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag treft voorzieningen die alle reisbureaus en andere belanghebbenden in staat stellen aan de passagiers tijdig voor hun vertrek een opgave te doen toekomen van de inentingen die de gezondheidsdiensten in de betreffende landen verplicht stellen, evenals formulieren voor inentingscertificaten die voldoen aan de Internationale Gezondheidsregeling. Het openbaar gezag neemt alle maatregelen die ertoe leiden dat degenen die de inentingen uitvoeren gebruik maken van de internationale certificaten van inenting of herinenting, teneinde uniformiteit te bereiken.  

6.6 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou in een zo groot mogelijk aantal havens voorzieningen beschikbaar moeten stellen voor het invullen van internationale certificaten van inenting of herinenting, alsmede faciliteiten voor inenting.  

6.7 *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag ziet erop toe dat sanitaire maatregelen en gezondheidsformaliteiten ten spoedigste worden uitgevoerd en voltooid en zonder discriminatie worden toegepast.  

6.8 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Het openbaar gezag zou in een zo groot mogelijk aantal havens doelmatige faciliteiten in stand moeten houden ten dienste van de volksgezondheid, alsmede voor het treffen van quarantainemaatregelen voor dieren en landbouwproducten.  

6.9 *Norm.* Er worden in elke Staat voor zover dit redelijkerwijs mogelijk is in een zo groot mogelijk aantal havens voor onmiddellijk gebruik medische inrichtingen voor spoedeisende behandeling van bemanningsleden en passagiers in stand gehouden.  

6.10 *Norm.* Behalve in een noodgeval dat een ernstige bedreiging voor de volksgezondheid vormt, wordt een schip dat niet is besmet of ten aanzien waarvan geen verdenking van besmetting bestaat met enige ziekte waarvoor quarantainevoorschriften gelden, niet op grond van enige epidemische ziekte door de havengezondheidsdienst belet lading of scheepsvoorraad te laden of te lossen of brandstof of water aan boord te nemen.  

6.11 *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Zendingen van dieren, dierlijke grondstoffen, onbewerkte dierlijke producten, levensmiddelen van dierlijke oorsprong en plantaardige producten waarvoor quarantainevoorschriften gelden, zouden in bepaalde omstandigheden moeten worden toegelaten, indien zij vergezeld gaan van een quarantainecertificaat in een vorm zoals de desbetreffende Staten zijn overeengekomen.      
### DEEL  7  

####DIVERSE BEPALINGEN

### A  

####Borgstellingen en andere vormen van zekerheid

7.1.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* In gevallen waarin het openbaar gezag een borgstelling of andere vormen van zekerheid van de reders verlangt ten aanzien van hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van wetten en voorschriften van een Staat op het gebied van douane, immigratie, volksgezondheid of landbouwquarantaine of soortgelijke wetten en voorschriften, zou het het gebruik van een enkele allesomvattende borgstelling of andere vorm van zekerheid waar mogelijk moeten toelaten.   

### B  

####Dienstverlening in havens

7.2.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De normale diensten van het openbaar gezag in een haven zouden kosteloos gedurende de normale werktijd moeten worden verleend. Het openbaar gezag zou vaste werktijden voor het verlenen van diensten in de havens moeten vaststellen, en wel zodanig dat deze samenvallen met de uren waarin gewoonlijk het meeste werk zou moeten worden verricht.   
7.3.  *Norm.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen nemen alle passende maatregelen voor het organiseren van de normale diensten van het openbaar gezag in havenplaatsen teneinde onnodige vertraging van schepen na aankomst, of wanneer zij voor de afvaart gereed zijn, te voorkomen en de tijd nodig voor het vervullen van formaliteiten tot een minimum te beperken, mits de geschatte tijd van aankomst of vertrek ruim tevoren aan het openbaar gezag wordt medegedeeld.   
7.4.  *Norm.* Door een gezondheidsdienst worden geen kosten in rekening gebracht voor een geneeskundig onderzoek, of een aanvullend onderzoek, hetzij bacteriologisch of anderszins, dat op welk tijdstip ook overdag of ’s nachts wordt verricht, indien een dergelijk onderzoek geboden is ter vaststelling van de gezondheidstoestand van de onderzochte persoon, noch voor het bezoeken en controleren van een schip met het oog op quarantaine, behalve voor de controle van een schip verband houdend met de afgifte van een ontrattingscertificaat of vrijstelling van een ontrattingscertificaat. Evenmin zullen kosten in rekening worden gebracht voor de inenting van een per schip aangekomen persoon, noch voor het afgeven van een daarop betrekking hebbend certificaat. Indien echter andere maatregelen dan de hierboven genoemde nodig zijn met betrekking tot het schip, zijn passagiers of zijn bemanning en voor hun door een gezondheidsdienst kosten worden gemaakt, worden deze kosten in rekening gebracht op basis van een afzonderlijk tarief dat gelijk is voor het gehele desbetreffende grondgebied en deze kosten zullen worden geheven zonder onderscheid naar nationaliteit, domicilie of woonplaats van de desbetreffende persoon of naar nationaliteit, vlag, registratie of eigendom van het schip.   
7.5.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Wanneer de diensten van het openbaar gezag worden verleend buiten de vaste arbeidstijden bedoeld in aanbevolen werkwijze 7.2, worden deze verleend tegen een redelijk tarief dat niet uitgaat boven de feitelijke kosten van de verleende diensten.   
7.6.  *Norm.* Voor zover de intensiteit van het scheepvaartverkeer in een haven zulks toelaat, zorgt het openbaar gezag ervoor dat diensten beschikbaar zijn voor het vervullen van de formaliteiten met betrekking tot lading en bagage, ongeacht de waarde die deze mocht hebben of de aard ervan.   
7.7.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen zouden moeten trachten tot een regeling te komen waarbij de ene Regering een andere Regering bepaalde faciliteiten verleent vóór of gedurende de reis, met betrekking tot het onderzoeken van schepen, passagiers, bemanning, bagage, lading en documenten verband houdend met douane, immigratie, volksgezondheid en quarantainevoorschriften voor planten en dieren, voor zover dit de inklaring na aankomst in de laatste Staat zou vergemakkelijken.   

### C  

####Noodhulp

7.8.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag vergemakkelijkt de aankomst en het vertrek van schepen die betrokken zijn bij: 

* rampenbestrijding;  

* de redding van personen in nood op zee teneinde dergelijke personen een veilig heenkomen te bieden;  

* het bestrijden of voorkomen van verontreiniging van de zee; of  

* andere operaties bij noodsituaties gericht op het vergroten van de veiligheid op zee, de veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee, de veiligheid van de bevolking of de bescherming van het mariene milieu.     
7.9.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag vergemakkelijkt, in de ruimst mogelijke mate, de binnenkomst en douanebehandeling van personen, lading, materiaal en apparatuur die benodigd zijn voor de in norm 7.8 beschreven situaties.   
7.10.  *Norm.* Het openbaar gezag staat snelle in- en uitklaring toe van specialistische apparatuur die benodigd is voor de uitvoering van veiligheidsmaatregelen.   

### D  

####Nationale vereenvoudigingscommissies

7.11.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Elke Verdragsluitende Regering zou, wanneer zij dit noodzakelijk en passend acht, een nationaal programma voor de vereenvoudiging van het verkeer ter zee moeten vaststellen op basis van de vereisten van deze Bijlage aangaande vereenvoudiging, en zou moeten verzekeren dat de doelstelling van haar vereenvoudigingsprogramma het aannemen is van alle praktische maatregelen ter vereenvoudiging van het verkeer van schepen, lading, bemanningen, passagiers, post en voorraden, door het wegnemen van onnodige hindernissen en vertragingen.   
7.12.  *Aanbevolen werkwijze.* Elke Verdragsluitende Regering zou een nationale commissie voor de vereenvoudiging van het verkeer ter zee moeten instellen, of een soortgelijk nationaal coördinerend orgaan tussen ministeries, instanties en andere organisaties die zich bezighouden met of verantwoordelijk zijn voor verscheidene aspecten van het internationale verkeer ter zee, alsmede havenautoriteiten en reders, om te stimuleren dat vereenvoudigingsmaatregelen worden genomen en uitgevoerd. *Noot:* De Verdragsluitende Regeringen wordt verzocht bij het instellen van een nationale commissie voor de vereenvoudiging van het verkeer ter zee of een soortgelijk nationaal coördinerend orgaan de richtlijnen vervat in FAL.5/Circ.2 in aanmerking te nemen.

####IMDG-Code, Wijziging 33-06, hoofdstuk 5.4 inzake documentatie

###Noot 1:

De bepalingen van deze Code staan het gebruik van technieken voor de elektronische verwerking van gegevens (EDP) en de elektronische onderlinge uitwisseling van gegevens (EDI) als hulpmiddel bij papieren documenten niet in de weg. 
###Noot 2:

Wanneer gevaarlijke goederen voor vervoer worden aangeboden, moeten soortgelijke documenten als die welke vereist zijn voor andere categorieën goederen worden opgesteld. De vorm van deze documenten, de gegevens die erop moeten worden ingevuld en de verplichtingen die zij inhouden kunnen worden vastgelegd in internationale overeenkomsten die van toepassing zijn op bepaalde vervoerswijzen en in de nationale wetgeving. 
###Noot 3:

Een van de belangrijkste vereisten van een vervoersdocument voor gevaarlijke goederen is het overdragen van de fundamentele informatie met betrekking tot de risico’s die aan de goederen verbonden zijn. Het is derhalve noodzakelijk bepaalde basisgegevens op te nemen in het document voor een zending gevaarlijke goederen tenzij in deze Code hiervoor een vrijstelling of een ander vereiste geldt.

### Aanhangsel  6  

####Eenvoudiger verzendingsmerken

<sup> 1)  Het betreft Aanbeveling nr. 15, derde editie (mei 1992) van de Economische Commissie voor Europa van de VN, en is aangenomen door de Werkgroep ter Vereenvoudiging van Internationale Handelsprocedures  </sup>  

### I  

####Achtergrond

1. Verzendingsmerken hebben tot doel de lading te identificeren en dragen bij tot een snelle, soepele en veilige verplaatsing van de lading, zonder vertragingen of verwarring, naar de eindbestemming. Daarnaast maken ze het mogelijk de lading aan de hand van documenten te controleren. In een aantal gevallen zijn de merken echter zo lang en gedetailleerd geworden dat ze niet meer op de zijkanten van het collo passen. Er wordt wel gesteld dat colli documenten zijn geworden. Dit leidt tot onnodige kosten, fouten, verwarring en vertraging bij de verzending en ondermijnt bovendien het feitelijke doel van verzendingsmerken.  

2. Verzendingsmerken verschillen sterk per land en per vervoerswijze. Gezien de toenemende omvang van de internationale handel, de opkomst van multimodale en gecombineerde vervoerssystemen, de groeiende behoefte dergelijke data zo te beheren dat ze optimaal kunnen worden gebruikt in moderne systemen en faciliteiten voor automatische gegevensverwerking, en het toegenomen kostenbewustzijn, is het duidelijk dat er behoefte is aan eenvoudige en consequent gebruikte normen voor verzendingsmerken.  

3. Een aantal voordelen van een dergelijke standaardisering zijn: 

**Kostenreductie.** Elk karakter minder in verzendingsmerken bespaart tijd en geld bij het aanbrengen van merken op goederen, het typen van documenten, het overschrijven van informatie en bij het computergebruik.  

*Snellere controle* van lading en documenten – bijvoorbeeld bij het tellen van de lading en het controleren van documentaire kredieten. Dit leidt tot een snellere omlooptijd van vaartuigen en een betere cashflow.  

*Verhoogde veiligheid* door het gebruik van internationaal erkende symbolen voor behandelingsinstructies en gevarentekens.  

**Probleemloze levering van goederen.** Het doel van verzendingsmerken is verwezenlijkt; vertragingen en andere problemen als gevolg van lange, complexe merken worden vermeden.

4. Na uitvoerig onderzoek in verschillende landen, met name Frankrijk, de Duitse Democratische Republiek, Japan, Zweden, de USSR, het Verenigd Koninkrijk van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, en in samenwerking met internationale organisaties zoals de International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) en de International Cargo Handling Co-ordination Association (ICHCA), is besloten de volgende aanbeveling te doen, waarin het volgende wordt vastgelegd: 

Een *standaardverzendingsmerk* voor het markeren van colli en voor gebruik in documenten.  

*Informatiemerken* voor het geven van eventueel noodzakelijke aanvullende informatie, uitsluitend op colli.    

5. Erkend werd dat verzendingsmerken hoofdzakelijk door importeurs worden bepaald. Hoewel deze aanbeveling met name op hen is gericht – in het bijzonder de afdelingen inkoop en documentaire kredieten – is zij eveneens van toepassing op andere partijen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het markeren, behandelen en documenteren – bijvoorbeeld, overheidsinstanties en -instellingen, internationale organisaties, handelsmaatschappijen, producenten, exportverpakkers, loodsmedewerkers, vrachtverzenders, medewerkers van groepagedepots en in- en uitklaring, stuwadoors, havenautoriteiten, vervoerders (elke vervoerswijze) alsmede meet- en tallyinstituten.    

### II  

####Reikwijdte

6. Met deze aanbeveling wordt beoogd een standaardidentificatiecode voor zendingen in te stellen in de vorm van een vereenvoudigd en gestandaardiseerd verzendingsmerk, voor het markeren van colli en het overnemen ervan in documenten. Tevens wordt beoogd regels vast te stellen voor het gebruik van informatiemerken, hoewel deze geen deel uitmaken van deze Aanbeveling.    

### III  

####Toepassingsgebied

7. Het bij deze Aanbeveling ingestelde standaardverzendingsmerk dient te worden gebruikt voor het markeren van colli die in internationaal verkeer worden vervoerd met behulp van alle transportwijzen, voor het overnemen in bijbehorende documenten en als gegevenselement in de onderlinge uitwisseling van handelsgegevens.

### V  

####Gestandaardiseerde merken

####Het standaardverzendingsmerk

9. In deze Aanbeveling wordt een standaardverzendingsmerk vastgesteld en worden informatiemerken beschreven.  

10. Het standaardverzendingsmerk bestaat uit de onderstaande vier elementen in de aangegeven volgorde en dient zowel op colli als op documenten zichtbaar te zijn.  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| --- |  *Voorbeeld*   |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Initialen of afgekorte naam  | ABC  |
| 2. Referentienummer  | 1234  |
| 3. Bestemming  | BOMBAY  |
| 4. Collonummer  | 1/25  |

Elementen die voor een zending als onnodig wordt beschouwd, mogen worden weggelaten. In onderstaand Deel VI worden enkele voorbeelden gegeven van andere vereenvoudigde merken. 

1. *Initialen of afgekorte naam van ontvanger of koper:* naam/adres dienen niet volledig te worden afgebeeld tenzij het spoorvervoer betreft, in welk geval krachtens het CIM-Verdrag het volledige adres op alle colli vermeld dient te worden; dit is ook in het wegvervoer gebruikelijk. Noot: exporteurs en importeurs zouden er goed aan doen een lijst met initialen/afkortingen af te spreken die gebruikt kunnen worden voor alle zendingen tussen hen. Indien de voorkeur wordt gegeven aan een afgekorte naam in plaats van initialen zou gebruik kunnen worden gemaakt van de naam van de afzender/koper zoals afgekort in hun telexantwoord of kabeladres.  

2. *Referentienummer:* dient zo kort mogelijk te zijn om verwarring of foutieve overname te voorkomen. Alleen het belangrijkste nummer, zoals afgesproken tussen verkoper en koper dient te worden getoond, bijvoorbeeld het verzendingsnummer *of* het ordernummer *of* het factuurnummer. Gegevens als „ordernummer” en begeleidend(e) jaartal/datum dienen te worden vermeden.  

3. *Bestemming:* De naam van de haven of plaats van uiteindelijke bestemming van de goederen (haven van lossen, plaats van levering, plaats van levering door volgende vervoerder) dient altijd te worden vermeld. In het geval van overslag tijdens het vervoer, kan ook de naam van de overslaghaven of -locatie worden aangegeven, voorafgegaan door VIA, bijvoorbeeld NEW DELHI VIA BOMBAY. Bij multimodaal/gecombineerd vervoer dient echter uitsluitend de eindbestemming van de goederen te worden aangegeven; de vervoerder kan hierdoor de goederen via de voorkeursroute verzenden (bijv. via Adelaide in plaats van Sydney) en zo onderbreking van het transport op de overslaglocatie voorkomen (goederen met het opschrift CANBERRA VIA SYDNEY kunnen bijvoorbeeld voor inklaring worden vastgehouden in Sydney).  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
|  *Voorbeeld:*   | ABC  |
| --- | 1234  |
| --- | CANBERRA  |
| --- | 1/25  |

4. **Collonummer.** Het volgnummer en, wanneer bekend, het totale aantal colli of stuks, dient te worden aangegeven als bijvoorbeeld 1/25, 2/25, enzovoorts tot en met 25/25. Op documenten staat dit vermeld als „1/25”, d.w.z. „collo 1 van 25”. Aanduidingen als „P/Nr.” kunnen achterwege blijven.    

####Informatiemerken

11. Informatiemerken zijn niet essentieel voor de aflevering op de bestemming: ze staan vermeld op de colli (duidelijk gescheiden van het standaardverzendingsmerk), maar vormen geen onderdeel van het verzendingsmerk dat in de documenten moet worden overgenomen.  

12. Het *brutogewicht* in kilogrammen dient te worden vermeld indien het bijdraagt aan een veilige behandeling of (in het geval van luchtvervoer) juiste stuwage. Het gewicht dient onder het standaardverzendingsmerk te worden vermeld, maar er wel van gescheiden; bijvoorbeeld 462KG. Informatie als „BRUTOGEWICHT” kan achterwege blijven.  

13. Overige details als *land van herkomst* of *nr. importvergunning* zijn soms verplicht uit hoofde van overheidsvoorschriften of kunnen de douane-inklaring vergemakkelijken. Details kunnen ook op verzoek van de koper worden toegevoegd om sortering en herdistributie van goederen te vergemakkelijken. Het is echter niet aan te raden de adresgegevens van de verzender op colli te vermelden indien het risico op diefstal hierdoor toeneemt. Dergelijke details dienen duidelijk gescheiden te zijn van het standaardverzendingsmerk en tot een minimum te worden beperkt. Zij dienen zo veel mogelijk te worden afgekort, bijvoorbeeld IL GG22455 17067 2 in plaats van IMPORTVERGUNNING NR. G/G22455-17067-2.  

14. Het is normaalgesproken niet nodig het **nettogewicht** en de *hoogte/breedte/diepte* op colli te vermelden (alhoewel dit wel gebruikelijk is bij bepaalde goederen zoals chemicaliën in vaten of zeer grote colli); in de nationale en internationale regelgeving dient dit, voor zover mogelijk, niet verplicht worden gesteld. Wanneer deze gegevens wel verplicht zijn, kunnen ze worden afgekort tot bijvoorbeeld N401KG 105 x 90 x 62CM.    

####Opmerkingen bij gestandaardiseerde merken

15.1 Verzendingsmerken mogen een maximale lengte hebben van ten hoogste tien regels van 17 karakters per regel. Dit is het maximum dat voor documenten en computersystemen is vastgesteld in overeenstemming met internationaal aanbevolen normen.  

15.2 Bij het standaardverzendingsmerk en de informatiemerken mogen alleen karakters worden gebruikt die met een typmachine of telex kunnen worden vervaardigd of die langs elektronische weg kunnen worden verzonden. Het betreft de letters A tot en met Z, de cijfers 0 tot en met 9, de spatie en de volgende grafische tekens: punt [.], verbindingsstreepje of minteken [-], ronde haakjes [()], schuine streep of breukstreep [/] en komma[,]. Bepaalde andere grafische tekens kunnen als controletekens worden gebruikt binnen de syntaxregels voor de onderlinge uitwisseling van handelsgegevens van de UN/ECE, en dienen vermeden te worden in verzendingsmerken. Het betreft de volgende tekens: plus [+], dubbele punt [:], apostrof [’], isgelijkteken [=], vraagteken [?] en asterisk [*].  

15.3 Geometrische of andere figuren (bijv. ruiten, driehoeken, vierkanten) dienen niet in het standaardverzendingsmerk of de informatiemerken te worden gebruikt.  

15.4 Wanneer het standaardmerk in meer dan een alfabet of taal vereist is (bijv. Cyrillisch, Arabisch, Chinees) dient ten minste een merk in het Latijnse alfabet te zijn afgebeeld. Het andere merk dient tussen haakjes naast het eerste merk te worden afgebeeld of op een andere zijde van het collo (merken staan op twee zijden van de individuele colli van de zending – zie deel VII). Alleen het merk in het Latijnse alfabet dient in de documenten te worden overgenomen. (Deze regels zijn niet van toepassing op standaardverzendingsmerken op goederen die tussen landen worden verzonden waar het Latijnse alfabet niet wordt gebruikt.)  

15.5 Kleurcoderingen – zoals groene strepen of kruizen – dienen waar mogelijk vermeden te worden, en verwijzingen in documenten naar dergelijke coderingen mogen niet verplicht worden gesteld.    

### VI  

####Vereenvoudigde merken voor verschillende vervoerswijzen

16. Het standaardverzendingsmerk kan voor sommige vervoerswijzen nog verder vereenvoudigd worden, terwijl aanwijzingen voor het behandelen van de lading – met name gevarentekens – volledig dienen te worden afgebeeld. *Losse stukgoederen* in alle wijzen van vervoer dienen te worden voorzien van volledige merken in overeenstemming met deel V. *Groepagelading.* Zelfs wanneer de groepagelading gedurende het grootste gedeelte van de reis in een container of TIR-aanhangwagen wordt vervoerd, moet de lading toch worden behandeld in de diverse groepagedepots. De individuele onderdelen van de zending dienen te worden voorzien van volledige merken in overeenstemming met deel V. Indien een volle container of aanhangwagen van een verzender tijdens doorvoer wordt gesplitst ten behoeve van gescheiden afleveringen, moet elk deel eveneens voorzien zijn van een volledig merk. *Volledige belading* (bijv. volledig beladen containers (FCL), aanhangwagens, wagons of eenheidslaadinrichtingen (luchtvaart) die van één verzender naar één ontvanger worden gezonden): het standaardverzendingsteken kan als volgt worden vereenvoudigd: 

a. indien de lading gedekt is door één set documenten en de verpakking en inhoud in elk opzicht hetzelfde is – omvang, type, klasse (bijvoorbeeld, zakken van 50 kg met havervlokken of geraffineerde suiker), is er helemaal geen standaardverzendingsmerk nodig;  

b. indien de lading gedekt wordt door meer dan een set documenten (bijvoorbeeld twee facturen t.b.v. de boekhouding) of colli bevat met verschillende inhoud, zijn uitsluitend punt 2 en 4 van het standaardverzendingsmerk (referentienummer en verpakkingsnummer) nodig om de goederen aan de hand van de documenten te controleren en de goederen te identificeren door de douane of de ontvanger.  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | *Voorbeeld*:  | 1234  |
| --- | --- | 1/25  |

17. Het dient in elk geval mogelijk te zijn colli te vergelijken met een allesomvattende verpakkingslijst ten behoeve van douanecontrole en het sorteren en herdistribueren.  

18. Opgemerkt dient te worden dat containers en aanhangwagens die gevaarlijke goederen bevatten aan de buitenkant voorzien moeten zijn van gevarentekens en overige verplichte gegevens zoals de juiste technische benaming/juiste vervoersnaam van de inhoud. Soortgelijke regels zijn van toepassing op radioactief materiaal.   
###Luchtvracht, stukgoed of gegroepeerde lading.

19. In IATA-resolutie 606 is de verplichte en optionele inhoud van de verzendingsmerken voor luchtvracht vervat: 

a. Het standaardverzendingsmerk. Het luchtvrachtbriefnummer, als unieke referentie, vervangt onderdelen 1 en 2 van het standaardverzendingsmerk (afgekorte naam en referentienummer); de drieletterige IATA-code kan worden gebruikt als verkorte weergave van onderdeel 3 (bestemming); onderdeel 4 blijft ongewijzigd.  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | *Voorbeeld*:  | 015-12345675  |
| --- | --- | DEL  |
| --- | --- | 1/25  |

b. Voor gegroepeerde (groepage) lading kan het House AWB-nummer aan het einde van de merken worden afgebeeld.  

c. Informatiemerken. In de IATA-regelgeving wordt bepaald dat het brutogewicht onder het verzendingsmerk mag worden afgebeeld en dat het volledige adres van de ontvanger op ten minste een collo dient te staan.     

####Opmerkingen bij de unieke-identificatiecodemethodiek (UNIC)

20. Implementatie door de handel, vervoerders en Regeringen van de herziene Aanbeveling nr. 8 van de UN/ECE Werkgroep ter Vereenvoudiging van Internationale Handelsprocedures, „Unique Identification Code methodology”, zou de verzendingsmerken nog verder kunnen vereenvoudigen en tevens meer mogelijkheden bieden voor geautomatiseerde procedures, waaronder de onderlinge elektronische uitwisseling van handelsgegevens.  

21. De unieke identificatiecode (UNIC) zou de onderdelen 1 en 2 van het standaardverzendingsmerk (afgekorte naam en referentienummer) kunnen vervangen en gekoppeld kunnen worden aan systemen voor automatische gegevensverwerking in een van de landen of beide.  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| *Voorbeeld*:  | 16/128735258/B1928  |
| --- | HELSINKI  |
| --- | 1/25  |

22. Indien er een uitgebreid systeem voor automatische gegevensverwerking zou bestaan voor het controleren van goederenbewegingen en het verzenden van informatie, en dit systeem zou door de betrokken landen en vervoerders worden gebruikt bij een specifieke goederenbeweging, dan zou het standaardverzendingsmerk geheel vervangen kunnen worden door het UNIC (uitgezonderd onderdeel 4 – collonummer).  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| *Voorbeeld*:  | 16/128735258/B1928  |
| --- | 1/25  |

23. Het kan interessant zijn een vergelijking te trekken met de methoden voor automatische gegevensverwerking die door exploitanten van containerschepen worden gebruikt om, met behulp van enkel het containernummer (bijv. ABCU 2128835) wereldwijd ladingen te controleren en te traceren, en met de methoden die luchtvaartmaatschappijen gebruiken met luchtvrachtbriefnummers (bijv. 015-12345675).    

####Streepjescode

24. Wanneer er voor verzendingsmerken gebruik wordt gemaakt van streepjescodes, hangt het maximum aantal te gebruiken karakters af van een aantal factoren. De belangrijkste zijn de printtechniek, de leesapparatuur en de symbolen. Voor ondernemingen of organisaties die streepjescodes willen gebruiken bij hun standaardverzendingsmerken is het van belang de juiste symbolen en leesapparatuur te kiezen.    

### VII  

####Methodes voor het aanbrengen van merken

####Op documenten

25. In de *Layout Key* van de Verenigde Naties is de plaats aangegeven waar de verzendingsmerken moeten worden ingevuld, onder het kopje „Merken en nummers”:     ![10000053660](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053660)
Slechts het standaardverzendingsmerk dient te worden vermeld en *kopers dienen te waarborgen dat in de instructies ten aanzien van documentatie (met name in het geval van documentaire kredieten) geen aanvullende details vereist worden onder „Merken en nummers”* anders dan *het standaardverzendingsmerk.* De opmerkingen over gestandaardiseerde merken in deel V dienen in dit opzicht eveneens in aanmerking worden genomen.  

####Op lading

26. De sleutelwoorden bij merken op lading zijn: groot, vet en kort.    

####Het standaardverzendingsmerk

a. dient centraal te zijn aangebracht op twee zijden van het collo of de palletlading; stukvracht die als gewone zeevracht wordt vervoerd dient tevens aan de bovenzijde van een merk te zijn voorzien;  

b. moet in 5 cm hoge tekens zijn, maar kan waar nodig worden aangepast aan de afmetingen van het collo;  

c. dient bij voorkeur te worden gestencild met zwarte inkt (of in een kleur die afsteekt tegen de achtergrond) die watervast is, permanent en bestand tegen vocht en wrijving.   *Opmerking 1* – Indien een viltstift wordt gebruikt, dient de inkt watervast en permanent te zijn, zoals aangegeven op het inktreservoir van geschikte pennen. Er dienen grote en duidelijke blokletters te worden gebruikt. *Opmerking 2* – Er zou gebruik kunnen worden gemaakt van fluorescerende kleuren. Rood zou uitsluitend voor gevaarlijke lading moeten worden gebruikt. Sommige kleuren kunnen wegvallen tegen de achtergrond onder fluorescerende-, kwik- of natriumlampen.  

####Informatiemerken dienen duidelijk gescheiden te zijn van het standaardverzendingsmerk en dienen in kleinere karakters of in een andere kleur te worden afgebeeld.

####Opmerkingen bij de methodes voor het aanbrengen van merken

27. Onverpakte artikelen zoals ijzerwerk dienen te worden voorzien van een metalen plaatje, dat met stevig metaaldraad is vastgemaakt. Persoonlijke bezittingen kunnen van een hangetiket worden voorzien. Plaatjes en hangetiketten dienen verder vermeden te worden.   *Balen* dienen aan beide zijden van een merk te zijn voorzien. *Zakken* dienen aan beide zijden van een merk te zijn voorzien waarbij een markeervloeistof moet worden gebruikt die doordringt in het materiaal. Wanneer een materiaal doorlatend is, zoals juten zakken, dienen de merken voor het afvullen zijn aangebracht. *Vaten* dienen aan de bovenzijde en aan de zijkant van merken te zijn voorzien; de grootte van de tekens op de bovenzijde kan verkleind worden vanwege de beperkte ruimte waar het merk kan worden aangebracht. *Mandflessen* dienen aan weerszijden te zijn voorzien van zelfklevende etiketten. *Oppervlakken die door riemen of banden bedekt worden* mogen niet van merken worden voorzien.  *Oude merken dienen volledig verwijderd te worden.*
