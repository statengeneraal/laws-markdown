####Overgangsbepalingen

1.  *Voortzetting van de werkzaamheden*  

a) Elke overeenkomst die door EUTELSAT is aangegaan en die van kracht is op het tijdstip waarop de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. wordt opgericht, blijft van kracht, tenzij en totdat deze wordt gewijzigd of beëindigd overeenkomstig het bepaalde in die overeenkomst. Elk besluit dat door EUTELSAT wordt genomen en dat van kracht is op het tijdstip waarop de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. wordt opgericht, blijft van kracht, tenzij en totdat dit besluit wordt gewijzigd of ingetrokken.  

b) Indien op het tijdstip waarop de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. wordt opgericht, een orgaan van EUTELSAT is begonnen aan de uitvoering van werkzaamheden waartoe zij gemachtigd is of die zij dient uit te voeren, maar nog niet heeft voltooid, stelt de Algemeen Secretaris of de eerste president-directeur van de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A., zich, in het kader van hun respectieve bevoegdheden en in overeenstemming met tussen EUTELSAT en de Vennootschap Eutelsat S. A. overeengekomen regelingen, in de plaats van dit orgaan ten behoeve van de voltooiing van deze werkzaamheden.    

2.  *Wijze van overdracht*  

a) EUTELSAT sluit met de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. een overeenkomst (de „Overdrachtovereenkomst”) voor de overdracht van al haar of een deel van haar activa en passiva die verband houden met haar werkzaamheden (nader aangeduid in de Overdrachtovereenkomst) aan de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. (de „Overdracht”).  

b) De Overdracht leidt tot een universele overdracht van alle rechten, titels, belangen en voordelen en alle verplichtingen en verantwoordelijkheden die verbonden zijn met de aldus overgedragen activa en passiva en de aldus overgedragen activa en passiva vormen een volledige en autonome categorie werkzaamheden. Deze Overdracht heeft hetzelfde gevolg als dat welk voortvloeit uit een splitsing ingevolge de artikelen 382 en volgende van de Franse wet No 66-537 van 24 juli 1966 inzake handelsvennootschappen, met dien verstande evenwel dat de verplichtingen en formaliteiten die ingevolge de bepalingen van deze wet gewoonlijk rusten op de overdragende vennootschap, niet op EUTELSAT van toepassing zijn.  

c) Onverminderd het hierboven bepaalde is de Overdracht *erga omnes* van kracht vanaf de in de Overdrachtovereenkomst genoemde datum, zonder dat hiervoor de betekening aan of instemming of goedkeuring van enige persoon, met inbegrip van personen aan wie dergelijke verplichtingen en verantwoordelijkheden verschuldigd zijn, vereist is. De Overdracht wordt op dezelfde wijze van kracht ten aanzien van enige persoon met wie EUTELSAT een overeenkomst met een *intuiti personae* -karakter is aangegaan.    

3.  *Bestuur*  

a) Ten aanzien van paragraaf 2, onder c), van deze Bijlage hebben alle leden van het personeel van het Uitvoerend orgaan van EUTELSAT het recht te worden overgeplaatst naar de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A., en voor alle personen die van dit recht gebruik maken, gelden, vanaf de datum van hun overplaatsing, arbeidsvoorwaarden die, voor zover deze verenigbaar zijn met het Franse recht, ten minste gelijkwaardig zijn aan die welke onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan de datum van hun overplaatsing voor hen golden.  

b) Personen die op de datum van de Overdracht een uitkering ingevolge de voorschriften van de pensioenregeling van EUTELSAT ontvangen, blijven deze ontvangen in overeenstemming met alle vanaf de datum van de Overdracht van kracht zijnde relevante voorschriften van deze regeling.  

c) Met betrekking tot personen die op de datum van de Overdracht een recht op uitkering hebben verkregen ingevolge de voorschriften van de pensioenregeling van EUTELSAT, worden gepaste maatregelen genomen om deze rechten te behouden.  

d) In overeenstemming met het bepaalde in paragraaf 1 van deze Bijlage blijven de van kracht zijnde arbeidsvoorwaarden voor het personeel van toepassing, totdat nieuwe arbeidsvoorwaarden worden opgesteld door de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A.  

e) Tot het tijdstip waarop de eerste Voorzitter van de Directie van de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. en de eerste Algemeen Secretaris hun ambt aanvaarden, worden hun respectieve functies uitgeoefend door de Directeur-Generaal van EUTELSAT.    

4.  *Overdracht van de functies van EUTELSAT aan de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. en aan de Algemeen Secretaris.*  

a) Op de datum waarop de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. wordt opgericht, stelt de Directeur-Generaal van EUTELSAT alle betrokkenen hiervan in kennis.  

b) De Directeur-Generaal van EUTELSAT neemt alle noodzakelijke maatregelen voor een tijdige overdracht aan de Vennootschap Eutelsat S.A. en aan de Algemeen Secretaris van alle rechten en verplichtingen die door EUTELSAT in haar hoedanigheid van wettelijk vertegenwoordigster van EUTELSAT zijn verkregen.       

### Bijlage  B  

####Arbitrageprocedure

1. Teneinde uitspraak te kunnen doen in een geschil, zoals bedoeld in artikel XV van het Verdrag, wordt een scheidsgerecht ingesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in de volgende leden.  

2. Elke Partij bij het Verdrag kan zich in het kader van de arbitrage voegen bij één van beide partijen bij het geschil.  

3. Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden. Elke partij bij het geschil wijst één lid van het scheidsgerecht aan binnen een termijn van twee maanden, te rekenen van de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek van de ene partij om het geschil aan arbitrage te onderwerpen. Doordat ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel XV van het Verdrag de instemming van de partijen bij het geschil vereist is om het geschil aan arbitrage te onderwerpen, wordt de termijn van twee maanden berekend vanaf de datum van instemming. Binnen een termijn van twee maanden, te rekenen vanaf de aanwijzing van het tweede lid van het scheidsgerecht, wijzen de eerste twee leden van het scheidsgerecht het derde lid van het scheidsgerecht aan, die als voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht optreedt. lndien één van de twee leden van het scheidsgerecht niet is aangewezen binnen de vereiste termijn, wordt hij, op verzoek van één van beide partijen, aangewezen door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof of, indien er geen overeenstemming is tussen de partijen, door de Secretaris-Generaal van het Permanente Hof van Arbitrage. Dezelfde procedure wordt gevolgd, indien de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht niet binnen de vereiste termijn is aangewezen.  

4. Het scheidsgerecht bepaalt de plaats van zijn zitting en stelt zijn eigen procedureregel vast.  

5. Elke partij draagt de kosten met betrekking tot het lid van het scheidsgerecht voor wiens aanwijzing zij verantwoordelijk is, alsmede de kosten van vertegenwoordiging voor het scheidsgerecht. De uitgaven met betrekking tot de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht worden gelijkelijk gedeeld door de partijen bij het geschil.  

6. De uitspraak van het scheidsgerecht dient namens een meerderheid van zijn leden te worden gedaan, die zich niet van stemming mogen onthouden. Deze uitspraak is definitief en bindend voor alle partijen bij het geschil en is niet voor beroep vatbaar. De partijen geven onverwijld uitvoering aan de uitspraak. ln geval van een geschil over de uitleg of de draagwijdte van de uitspraak wordt deze op verzoek van enige partij bij het geschil toegelicht.
