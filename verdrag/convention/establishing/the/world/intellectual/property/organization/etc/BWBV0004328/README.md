Op elke gewone zitting kiest de Conferentie de Staten die deze vergaderingen zullen bijwonen.

Ingeval uit deze bijzondere telling blijkt dat niet op elk van deze lijsten de eenvoudige meerderheid is behaald, wordt het voorstel als niet aangenomen beschouwd.     
7).  Elke Lid-Staat van de Organisatie die geen lid is van de Coörnatiecommissie kan op vergaderingen van deze Commissie worden vertegenwoordigd door waarnemers, die het recht hebben deel te nemen aan de besprekingen, doch geen stemrecht bezitten.

### Artikel  9  

####Internationaal Bureau

1).  Het Internationale Bureau treedt op als het secretariaat van de Organisatie.   
2).  Het Internationale Bureau staat onder leiding van de Directeur-Generaal, bijgestaan door twee of meer Plaatsvervangende Directeuren-Generaal.   
3).  De Directeur-Generaal wordt benoemd voor een vastgesteld tijdvak, dat niet korter mag zijn dan zes jaar. Zijn benoeming kan voor vastgestelde tijdvakken worden hernieuwd. De duur van het eerste tijdvak en van de eventueel volgende tijdvakken, alsmede alle andere aanstellingsvoorwaarden, worden vastgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering.   
4).  

a) De Directeur-Generaal is de hoogste functionaris van de Organisatie.  

b) Hij vertegenwoordigt de Organisatie.  

c) Hij legt verantwoording af tegenover de Algemene Vergadering en houdt zich aan haar richtlijnen met betrekking tot de interne en externe aangelegenheden van de Organisatie.     
5).  De Directeur-Generaal stelt de ontwerp-begrotingen en ontwerp-programma's op, alsmede periodieke verslagen van werkzaamheden. Hij zendt deze toe aan de regeringen van de betrokken Staten, alsmede aan de bevoegde organen van de Unies en van de Organisatie.   
6).  De Directeur-Generaal en ieder door hem aangewezen lid van het personeel nemen zonder stemrecht deel aan alle bijeenkomsten van de Algemene Vergadering, van de Conferentie, van de Coördinatiecommissie en van de andere commissies en werkgroepen. De Directeur-Generaal of een door hem aangewezen lid van het personeel is ambtshalve secretaris van die organen.   
7).  De Directeur-Generaal benoemt het personeel dat nodig is voor een goed functioneren van het Internationale Bureau. Hij benoemt de Plaatsvervangende Directeuren-Generaal na goedkeuring door de Coördinatiecommissie. De arbeidsvoorwaarden worden vastgesteld in het Personeelsstatuut, dat moet worden goedgekeurd door de Coördinatiecommissie op voorstel van de Directeur-Generaal. De noodzaak zich te voorzien van de diensten van hoog gekwalificeerde ambtenaren uit een oogpunt van geschiktheid, bekwaamheid en integriteit, dient de overheersende overweging te zijn bij de aanwerving van personeel en de bepaling van hun arbeidsvoorwaarden. Er dient naar behoren rekening te worden gehouden met het belang deze aanwerving op een zo breed mogelijke geografische grondslag te doen geschieden.   
8).  De functies van de Directeur-Generaal en van de personeelsleden dragen een strikt internationaal karakter. Bij de uitoefening van hun functies mogen zij geen instructies verzoeken of aanvaarden van enige Regering of autoriteit buiten de Organisatie. Zij dienen zich te onthouden van elke handeling die hun status van internationale ambtenaren zou kunnen schaden. Elke Lid-Staat verbindt zich, het uitsluitend internationale karakter van de functies van de Directeur-Generaal en van de personeelsleden te eerbiedigen en niet te pogen hen bij de uitoefening van hun functies te beïnvloeden.

b) De begroting wordt gefinancierd uit de volgende inkomsten: 

i) De bijdragen van de Unies, met dien verstande dat het bedrag van de bijdrage van elke Unie wordt vastgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering van deze Unie, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de mate waarin de gemeenschappelijke uitgaven worden verricht in het belang van genoemde Unie;  

ii) de taksen en gelden verschuldigd voor diensten verleend door het Internationale Bureau die niet rechtstreeks in verband staan met een der Unies of die niet worden ontvangen voor diensten verleend door het Internationale Bureau op het gebied van de technisch-juridische bijstand;  

iii) de opbrengst van de verkoop van de publikaties van het Internationale Bureau die niet rechtstreeks een der Unies betreffen en de rechten welke op deze publikaties betrekking hebben;

3).  

a) De begroting van de Conferentie omvat de ramingen van uitgaven voor het houden van de zittingen van de Conferentie en voor het programma voor technisch-juridische bijstand.  

b) Deze begroting wordt gefinancierd uit de volgende inkomsten: 

i) de bijdragen van de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en geen lid zijn van een der Unies;  

ii) de gelden die eventueel door de Unies ter beschikking van deze begroting worden gesteld, met dien verstande dat het bedrag dat door elke Unie ter beschikking wordt gesteld, door de Algemene Vergadering van deze Unie wordt vastgesteld en dat het iedere Unie vrij staat niet aan deze begroting bij te dragen;

|
|
| Klasse A..........  Klasse B..........  Klasse C..........  | 10  3  1  |

b) Op het tijdstip waarop hij een der handelingen verricht bedoeld in het eerste lid van artikel 14, geeft elke zodanige Staat de klasse aan waarin hij wenst te worden gerangschikt. Hij kan van klasse veranderen. Wanneer hij een lagere klasse kiest, moet de Staat zulks aan de Conferentie mededelen tijdens een der gewone zittingen. Een dergelijke verandering gaat in bij het begin van het kalenderjaar volgend op dat van genoemde zitting.  

c) De jaarlijkse bijdrage van elke zodanige Staat bestaat in een bedrag, waarvan de verhouding tot de som van de jaarlijkse bijdragen van alle zodanige Staten aan de begroting van de Conferentie dezelfde is als de verhouding tussen het aantal eenheden van de klasse waarin hij is ondergebracht, en het totale aantal eenheden van de genoemde Staten gezamenlijk.  

d) De bijdragen zijn ieder jaar op 1 januari verschuldigd.  

e) Ingeval een begroting niet is vastgesteld voor de aanvang van het nieuwe begrotingsjaar, wordt de begroting van het voorafgaande jaar aangehouden volgens de werkwijze voorzien in het financieel reglement.     
5).  Elke Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag, doch geen lid is van een der Unies en die achterstallig is met de betaling van zijn bijdragen volgens het bepaalde in dit artikel, evenals elke Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag, lid is van een der Unies en die achterstallig is met de betaling van zijn bijdragen voor deze Unie, kan in geen der organen van de Organisatie waarvan hij lid is zijn stemrecht uitoefenen, indien het bedrag van zijn achterstalligheid gelijk is aan of hoger is dan dat der bijdragen verschuldigd over twee volledige verstreken jaren. Zulk een Staat kan evenwel vergund worden de uitoefening van zijn stemrecht in het desbetreffende orgaan te behouden, zolang dit orgaan van oordeel is dat de achterstalligheid wordt veroorzaakt door uitzonderlijke en onvermijdelijke omstandigheden.   
6).  Het bedrag der taksen en der gelden verschuldigd voor door het Internationale Bureau verleende diensten op het gebied van de technisch-juridische bijstand, wordt vastgesteld door de Directeur-Generaal, die daarover verslag uitbrengt aan de Coördinatiecommissie.   
7).  Met goedkeuring van de Coördinatiecommissie kan de Organisatie giften, legaten en subsidies ontvangen die rechtstreeks afkomstig zijn van regeringen, publieke of particuliere instellingen, verenigingen of particulieren.

b) Het bedrag van de eenmalige storting van elke Unie en dat van haar eventuele deelneming aan elke bijstorting worden vastgesteld door de Algemene Vergadering van die Unie.  

c) Het bedrag van de eenmalige storting van elke Staat die partij is bij dit Verdrag en die geen lid is van een Unie en zijn deelneming aan een aanvulling zijn evenredig aan de bijdrage van die Staat voor het jaar waarin het fonds is gesticht of tot bijstorting is besloten. Het aandeel en de wijze van storting worden vastgesteld door de Conferentie op voorstel van de Directeur-Generaal en na ingewonnen advies van de Coördinatiecommissie.     
9).  

a) De Overeenkomst betreffende de zetelvestiging, gesloten met de Staat op welks grondgebied de Organisatie haar zetel heeft, bepaalt dat, indien het operationele fonds niet toereikend is, die Staat voorschotten verstrekt. Het bedrag van deze voorschotten en de voorwaarden waaronder zij worden verstrekt, vormen telkenmale het onderwerp van afzonderlijke overeenkomsten tussen de betrokken Staat en de Organisatie. Zolang deze Staat gehouden is voorschotten te verstrekken beschikt hij van rechtswege over een zetel in de Coördinatiecommissie.  

b) De Staat bedoeld onder letter a) en de Organisatie hebben elk het recht de overeenkomst tot het verstrekken van voorschotten schriftelijk op te zeggen. De opzegging wordt van kracht drie jaar na afloop van het jaar waarin de kennisgeving is gedaan.     
10).  Het nazien der rekeningen wordt verricht op de wijze voorzien in het financiële reglement, door een of meer Lid-Staten of door onafhankelijke controleurs, die, met hun instemming, zijn aangewezen door de Algemene Vergadering.

Elke hiertoe met deze organisaties aangegane algemene overeenkomst wordt gesloten door de Directeur-Generaal, na goedkeuring door de Coördinatiecommissie.   
2).  De Organisatie kan terzake van binnen haar bevoegdheid liggende vragen alle passende maatregelen nemen, zowel met het oog op raadpleging van niet-gouvernementele internationale organisaties en, onder voorbehoud van de toestemming van de betrokken Regeringen, van gouvernementele of niet-gouvernementele nationale organisaties, als met het oog op samenwerking met genoemde organisaties.

Op die datum treedt dit Verdrag tevens in werking ten aanzien van de Staten die, geen lid van een der Unies zijnde, drie maanden of langer vóór genoemde datum één der handelingen bedoeld in het eerste lid van artikel 14 hebben verricht.

### Artikel  16  

####Voorbehouden

Ten aanzien van dit Verdrag is geen voorbehoud toegestaan.  

### Artikel  17  

####Wijzigingen

1).  Voorstellen tot wijziging van dit Verdrag kunnen worden ingediend door iedere Lid-Staat, door de Coördinatiecommissie of door de Directeur-Generaal. Deze voorstellen worden door laatstgenoemde ten minste zes maanden voor zij aan het onderzoek der Conferentie worden onderworpen, medegedeeld aan de Lid-Staten.   
2).  Alle wijzigingen worden aangenomen door de Conferentie. Ingeval van wijzigingen die van invloed zijn op de rechten en plichten van Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en die geen lid zijn van een der Unies, nemen deze Staten ook deel aan de stemming. Alleen de Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en die lid zijn van tenminste één der Unies, zijn bevoegd hun stem uit te brengen over voorstellen betreffende andere wijzigingen. De wijzigingen worden aangenomen bij eenvoudige meerderheid van stemmen, met dien verstande dat de Conferentie slechts stemt over wijzigingsvoorstellen die reeds zijn aangenomen door de Algemene Vergadering van de Unie van Parijs en de Algemene Vergadering van de Unie van Bern volgens de regels die in elk dezer Vergaderingen gelden voor de wijziging van de administratieve bepalingen van hun onderscheiden Verdragen.   
3).  Elke wijziging wordt van kracht één maand na ontvangst door de Directeur-Generaal van de schriftelijke verklaringen van aanvaarding, verricht overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden grondwettelijke procedures, door drie vierde van de Staten die op het tijdstip waarop de wijziging door de Conferentie werd aangenomen, lid waren van de Organisatie en het recht hadden hun stem uit te brengen over de volgens het bepaalde in het tweede lid voorgestelde wijziging. Elke aldus aanvaarde wijziging bindt alle Staten die lid zijn van de Organisatie op het tijdstip waarop de wijziging van kracht wordt of die op een latere datum lid worden; wijzigingen die de financiële verplichtingen van de Lid-Staten verzwaren, binden evenwel slechts die Staten die kennis hebben gegeven deze wijziging te aanvaarden.   

### Artikel  18  

####Opzegging

1).  Elke Lid-Staat kan dit Verdrag opzeggen door een aan de Directeur-Generaal te richten schriftelijke kennisgeving.
