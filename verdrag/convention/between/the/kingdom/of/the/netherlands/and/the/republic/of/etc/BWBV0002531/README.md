6.  An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the States merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.   
7.  The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other State, or which carries on business in that other State, (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6  

####Income from immovable Property

1.  Income derived by a resident of one of the States from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.   

### Article  7  

####Business Profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establisment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establisment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses incurred for the purposes of the enterprise as a whole, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in one of the States to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 of this Article shall preclude that State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####International Traffic

1.  Profits from international traffic shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.   
2.  If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
3.  For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the operation in international traffic of ships and aircraft include profits derived from the rental on a full or bareboat basis of ships and aircraft if operated in international traffic if such rental profits are incidental to the profits described in paragraph 1 of this Article.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply also to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated Enterprises

1.  Where: 

a) an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State; or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State; and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. It is understood, however, that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as costsharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in the preceding sentence.     
2.  Where one of the States includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State, and taxes accordingly, profits on which an enterprise of the other State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends derived from a company which is a resident of one of the States by a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the State of which the company from which the dividends are derived is a resident and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed: 

a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

b) 20 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.     
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2 of this Article.   
4.  The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident and also includes any other item which, under the law of the State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of a company.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the State in which it arises and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in one of the States shall be exempt from tax in that State if it is derived by the Government of the other State, a political subdivision or a local authority thereof or any agency or instrumentality of that Government, political subdivision or local authority thereof.   
4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article , interest arising in Zimbabwe and paid to the Nederlandse Fiancieringsmaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (Netherlands Finance Company for Developing Countries), and the Nederlandse Investeringsbank voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (Netherlands Investment Bank for Developing Countries) shall be exempt from Zimbabwean tax.   
5.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.   
6.  The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, but shall not include any item which is treated as a distribution under the provisions of Article 10. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
7.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
8.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
9.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debtclaim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of the Convention.   

### Article  12  

####Royalties

1.  Royalties arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such royalties may also be taxed in the State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2 of this Article.   
4.  The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work (including cinematograph films, and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting), any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, as well as payments of any kind to any person, other than to an employee of the person making the payments, in consideration for any services of a technical, managerial or consultancy nature.   
5.  The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article, shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid, are effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the contract under which the royalties are paid was concluded, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  13  

####Capital Gains

1.  Gains derived by a resident of one of the States from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other State, may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of one of the States in the other State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State.   
3.  Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 5 of Article 10, paragraph 7 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 15, Article 16, paragraph 2 of Article 18, Article 19 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Convention may be taxed in Zimbabwe and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 4 of Article 13, Article 17 and paragraph 1 of Article 18 of this Convention may be taxed in Zimbabwe to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Zimbabwe on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.   
4.  Subject to the provisions of the law of Zimbabwe regarding the allowance as a credit against Zimbabwean tax of tax payable in a territory outside Zimbabwe (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Netherlands tax payable under the law of the Netherlands and in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of taxable income or chargeable gains from sources within the Netherlands shall be allowed as a credit against any Zimbabwean tax computed by reference to the same taxable income or chargeable gains by reference to which Netherlands tax is computed.   
5.  For the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Article, in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and desinvestment payments as meant in the Wet Investeringsrekening (the Netherlands Investment Account Law) shall not be taken into account. For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraph 3 a and 4 of Article 2 shall be considered taxes on income.   
6.  For the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Article, taxable income and chargeable gains owned by a resident of Zimbabwe which may be taxed in the Netherlands in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources within the Netherlands.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  24  

####Non-Discrimination

1.  Nationals of one of the States shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. Provided that this paragraph shall not prevent one of the States from imposing on the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in that State of a company which is a resident of the other State a tax not exceeding 5 per cent of those profits in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on those profits if they were profits of a company which was a resident of the firstmentioned State.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 5 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident.   
6.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  25  

####Mutual Agreement Procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   

### Article  26  

####Exchange of Information

1.  The competent authorities of the States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by one of the States shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.     

### Article  27  

####Diplomatic Agents and consular Officers

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.   
2.  For the purposes of this Convention an individual, who is a member of a diplomatic or consular mission of one of the States in the other State or in a third State and who is a national of the sending State, shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending State if he is subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income as are residents of that State.   
3.  This Convention shall not apply to international organisations, organs and officials thereof and members of a diplomatic or consular mission of a third State, being present in one of the States, if they are not subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income as are residents of that State.   

### Article  28  

####Territorial Extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to the Netherlands Antilles and/or Aruba, if those countries impose taxes substantially similar in character to those to which this Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of this Convention shall not also terminate any extension of this Convention to the Netherlands Antilles and/or Aruba.

### *(1) Ad Article 7* 

a) In respect of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7, where an enterprise of one of the States sells goods or merchandise or carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, the profits of that permanent establishment shall not be determined on the basis of the total amount received by the enterprise, but shall be determined only on the basis of the remuneration which is attributable to the actual activity of the permanent establishment for such sales or business.  

b) In the case of contracts for the survey, supply, installation or construction of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or premises, or of public works, when the enterprise has a permanent establishment, the profits of such permanent establishment shall not be determined on the basis of the total amount of the contract, but shall be determined only on the basis of that part of the contract which is effectively carried out by the permanent establishment in the State where the permanent establishment is situated. The profits related to that part of the contract which is carried out by the head office of the enterprise shall be taxable only in the State of which the enterprise is a resident.

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - waaronder begrepen ten behoeve van de gehele onderneming gemaakte kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voorzover het in een van de Staten gebruikelijk is de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet het tweede lid van dit artikel die Staat niet de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

####Internationaal verkeer

1.  Voordelen uit internationaal verkeer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarin de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
2.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een scheepvaartondememing zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Staat waarin de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvatten voordelen verkregen uit de exploitatie van schepen en luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer mede voordelen verkregen uit de verhuur van schepen en luchtvaartuigen op basis van verhuur met en zonder bemanning, indien deze schepen en luchtvaartuigen worden geëxploiteerd in internationaal verkeer en deze huuropbrengsten voortvloeien uit de voordelen als omschreven in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool”, een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a) een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b) dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat;   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemigen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast. Het is echter wel verstaan, dat de omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten, zoals „costsharing" overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in de voorgaande zin.   
2.  Indien een van de Staten in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt - en dienovereenkomstig belast - ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden verkregen van een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten door een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam waarvan de dividenden worden verkregen inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma) is dat onmiddellijk ten minste 25 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b) 20 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen. Dit lid laat onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam terzake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.     
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid van dit artikel.   
4.  De uitdrukking „dividenden”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen of andere rechten, niet zijnde schuldvorderingen, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de belastingwetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, met inkomsten uit aandelen worden gelijkgesteld en omvat mede al hetgeen ingevolge de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat het dividend betaalt inwoner is, wordt behandeld als dividend of uitdeling van een lichaam.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Staat waaruit hij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel is interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten vrijgesteld van belasting in die Staat indien hij wordt verkregen door de Regering van de andere Staat, een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan dan wel door een agentschap of instantie van die Regering, staatkundig onderdeel of plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan.   
4.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel is interest afkomstig uit Zimbabwe en betaald aan de Nederlandse Financieringsmaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. en de Nederlandse Investeringsbank voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. vrijgesteld van Zimbabwaanse belasting.   
5.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede, derde en vierde lid van dit artikel.   
6.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen, maar omvat niet de bestanddelen van het inkomen die krachtens de bepalingen van artikel 10 als uitdeling worden behandeld. In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
7.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
8.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien deze wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
9.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijke gerechtigde tot de royalty's is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid van dit artikel.   
4.  De uitdrukking „royalty's", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap (waaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms alsmede films of banden voor radio of televisie), van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, dan wel voor het gebruik van, of het recht van gebruik van, nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap, alsmede vergoedingen van welke aard ook aan een persoon, niet zijnde een werknemer van degene die de betalingen verricht, terzake van diensten van technische, leidinggevende of adviserende aard.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft waarvoor het contract op grond waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, was gesloten, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13

Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende zaken die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten inde andere Staat heeft, of van roerende zaken die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarin de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.

Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten in de uitoefening van een vrij beroep of ter zake van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij hij in de andere Staat voor het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden geregeld over een vast middelpunt beschikt. Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep” omvat in het bijzonder zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.

Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een in de andere Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstbedoelde Staat belastbaar, indien:

In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.    

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  23  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Zimbabwe mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, vijfde lid, artikel 11, zevende lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste en derde lid, artikel 16, artikel 18, tweede lid, artikel 19 en artikel 22, tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Zimbabwe mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomensbestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde bestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 13, vierde lid, artikel 17 en artikel 18, eeerste lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Zimbabwe mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Zimbabwe over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
4.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de wetgeving van Zimbabwe die betrekking hebben op de verrekening van belasting die in een gebied buiten Zimbabwe verschuldigd is, met belasting van Zimbabwe (welke bepalingen het algemene beginsel van het hierna volgende niet mogen aantasten), mag Nederlandse belasting die krachtens de wetgeving van Nederland en in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij door inhouding, verschuldigd is over uit Nederlandse bronnen verkregen belastbare inkomsten of belastbare vermogenswinsten worden verrekend met belasting van Zimbabwe, berekend over dezelfde belastbare inkomsten of belastbare vermogenswinsten als die waarover de Nederlandse belasting is berekend.   
5.  Voor de toepassing van het vierde lid van dit artikel worden bij de vaststelling van de belastingen naar het inkomen betaald aan Nederland, de investeringsbijdragen en -toeslagen en de desinvesteringsbetalingen als bedoeld in de Nederlandse Wet investeringsrekening niet in aanmerking genomen. Voor de toepassing van dit lid worden de belastingen als bedoeld in artikel 2, derde lid, onderdeel a, en vierde lid, beschouwd als belastingen naar het inkomen.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van het vierde lid van dit artikel worden belastbare inkomsten en belastbare vermogenswinsten die toekomen aan een inwoner van Zimbabwe en die volgens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nederland mogen worden belast, geacht afkomstig te zijn uit Nederlandse bronnen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  24  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoners zijn van een van de Staten of van beide Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten heeft in de andere Staat, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Dit lid verhindert echter niet dat een van de Staten over de voordelen die kunnen worden toegerekend aan een in die Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting van een lichaam dat inwoner is van de andere Staat, naast de belasting die over deze voordelen zou worden geheven, indien het voordelen waren van een lichaam dat inwoner was van de eerstgenoemde Staat, een belasting heft die 5 percent van die voordelen niet overschrijdt.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, zevende lid, of artikel 12, vijfde lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat. Zo ook zijn alle schulden van een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat bij de vaststelling van het belastbare vermogen van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij waren aangegaan met een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere, soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  Niets in dit artikel mag aldus worden uitgelegd, dat het een van de Staten verplicht aan natuurlijke personen die geen inwoner van die Staat zijn, bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken en verminderingen te verlenen die worden verleend aan natuurlijke personen die wel inwoner zijn.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  25  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 24, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, voor het eerst ter kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarin deze Overeenkomst niet voorziet.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  26  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen die inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst of van de nationale wetgeving van de Staten betreffende de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is voor zover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met deze Overeenkomst. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een van de Staten ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (waaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zo uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a) administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b) inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn krachtens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c) inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, of inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  27  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

1.  De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaren ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt een natuurlijke persoon die deel uitmaakt van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een van de Staten in de andere Staat of in een derde Staat en die onderdaan is van de zendstaat, geacht inwoner van de zendstaat te zijn, indien hij daarin aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen is onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   
3.  Deze Overeenkomst is niet van toepassing op internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, noch op leden van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat die in een van de Staten verblijven, indien zij in die Staat niet aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen zijn onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot de Nederlandse Antillen en/of Aruba, indien die landen belastingen heffen die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van deze Overeenkomst niet met zich mede dat tevens de uitbreiding van deze Overeenkomst tot de Nederlandse Antillen en/of Aruba wordt beëindigd.

### Protocol  

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting en het voorkomen van het ontgaan van belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen en naar vermogenswinsten, heden tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Zimbabwe gesloten, zijn de ondergetekenden overeengekomen dat de volgende bepalingen een integrerend deel van deze Overeenkomst vormen. 
### *(I) Ad artikel 7* 

a) Met betrekking tot artikel 7, eerste en tweede lid, geldt dat, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat goederen of koopwaar verkoopt of een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, voor de toepassing van het eerste en tweede lid, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet worden bepaald op basis van het totale door de onderneming ontvangen bedrag, doch slechts op basis van de vergoedingen die aan de werkelijke werkzaamheden van de vaste inrichting voor die verkopen of die bedrijfsuitoefening zijn toe te rekenen.  

b) In het geval van overeenkomsten betreffende het toezicht op, de levering, installatie of constructie van nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting of gebouwen alsmede bij openbare werken worden, indien de onderneming een vaste inrichting heeft, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet bepaald op basis van het totale bedrag van de overeenkomst maar slechts op basis van dat deel van de overeenkomst dat werkelijk wordt uitgevoerd door de vaste inrichting in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd. De voordelen die betrekking hebben op dat deel van de overeenkomst dat wordt uitgevoerd door het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de onderneming inwoner is.   
### *(II) Ad artikelen 10, 11 en 12* 

Indien aan de bron belasting is geheven die het belastingbedrag dat ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 10, 11 of 12 mag worden geheven te boven gaat, moeten verzoeken om teruggaaf van het daarboven uitgaande belastingbedrag worden ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven, binnen een tijdvak van drie jaren nadat de belasting is geheven. 
### *(III) Ad artikel 13* 

Bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van artikel 13 van deze Overeenkomst wordt in Zimbabwe het volgende in acht genomen. Indien het eigendomsrecht van een bepaald goed in de loop van of ter bevordering van een reorganisatieplan of een fusie of andere zakelijke handeling die volgens de Commissioner of Taxes van gelijksoortige aard is, wordt overgedragen van een lichaam naar een ander lichaam van hetzelfde concern, kunnen de overdrager en de verkrijger verzoeken dat de verkoopprijs van het goed, ongeacht de voorwaarden van de koopovereenkomst, voor de overdrager voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst geacht wordt een bedrag te zijn dat gelijk is aan de som van de aftrekken die krachtens de letters a, b, c en d van de onder afdeling 2 van afdeling elf van de Capital Gains Tax Act 1981 (Wet op de vermogenswinstbelasting 1981) van Zimbabwe, zoals deze in werking is op de datum van ondertekening van deze Overeenkomst, op de datum van overdracht aan zulk een overdrager met betrekking tot zulk een goed kunnen worden toegekend: met dien verstande dat indien dat goed na de overdracht wordt verkocht aan een lichaam dat niet tot hetzelfde concern behoort, de vermogenswinst bij de verkoper berekend wordt alsof het goed nog steeds eigendom was van de eerste overdrager voor wie een verzoek krachtens deze afdeling is gedaan.
