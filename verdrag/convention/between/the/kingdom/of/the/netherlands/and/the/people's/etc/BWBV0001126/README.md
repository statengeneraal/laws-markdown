### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6  

####Income from immovable property

1.  Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

### Article  7  

####Business profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  Shipping and Air Transport  

1.  Profits from the operation of aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

Profits arising in a Contracting State and derived from the operation of ships in international traffic by an enterprise having its place of effective management in the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State but the rate of tax chargeable in that State shall be reduced to fifty per cent thereof and shall in no case exceed 4 per cent.   
3.  If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated Enterprises

1.  Where - 

a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or,  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.     
2.  Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed: 

a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.     
3.  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.   
4.  The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, "jouissance" shares or "jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as income from profits sharing bonds and income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

4.  The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. However, this term does not include income dealt with in Article 10. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

3.  The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use a copyright of a literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films, or films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision a local authority or a resident of that State.

6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

### Article  23  

####Elimination of Double Taxation

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Bangladesh.   
2.  However where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 5 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraph 1 and 3 of Article 15, Article 16, Article 19 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Convention may be taxed in Bangladesh and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1 the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 8, paragraph 2 of Article 10 paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 5 of Article 13, Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18 of this Convention may be taxed in Bangladesh to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Bangladesh on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.   
4.  Where, by reason of special relief given under the provisions of Bangladesh law for the purpose of encouraging investment in Bangladesh the Bangladesh tax actually levied on interest and royalties arising in Bangladesh is lower than the tax Bangladesh may levy according to paragraph 2 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 12, then the amount of the tax paid in Bangladesh on such interest and royalties shall be deemed to have been paid at the rates of tax mentioned in the said provisions. However, if the general tax rates under Bangladesh law applicable to the afore-mentioned interest and royalties are reduced below those mentioned in the foregoing sentence these lower rates shall apply for the purposes of that sentence. The provisions of the two foregoing sentences shall only apply for a period of ten years after the date on which the Convention became effective. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.   
5.  Subject to the provisions of the law of Bangladesh regarding the allowance as a credit against Bangladesh tax of tax payable in a territory outside Bangladesh (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), tax payable under the laws of the Netherlands and in accordance with this Convention on income, profits or gains from sources within the Netherlands shall be allowed as a credit against any Bangladesh tax computed in respect of the same income, profits or gains by reference to which the Netherlands tax is computed. For the purposes of this paragraph in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and disinvestment payments as meant in the Netherlands Investment Account Law ("Wet investeringsrekening") shall not be taken into account. For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraph 3 (a) and 4 of Article 2 shall be considered taxes on income.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  24  

####Non-Discrimination

1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging in a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  25  

####Mutual Agreement Procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. When it seems advisable in order to reach agreement to have an oral exchange of opinions, such exchange may take place through a Commission consisting of representatives of the competent authorities of the States.   

### Article  26  

####Exchange of Information

1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).     

### Article  27  

####Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of a diplomatic mission or consular post under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.   
2.  For the purposes of the Convention, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending State if he is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on his total world income as are residents of that sending State.   
3.  The Convention shall not apply to international organisations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic, consular or permanent mission of a third State being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total world income as are residents thereof.   

### Article  28  

####Regulations

The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2 of Article 10, of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 12.  

### Article  29  

####Territorial Extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to any part or territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to which the Convention does not apply and which imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels or in any other manner, in accordance with their constitutional procedures.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to any part or territory to which it has been extended under this Article.

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - waaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voorzover het in een Verdragsluitende Staat gebruikelijk is de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet het tweede lid die Verdragsluitende Staat niet de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van de aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van dit Verdrag worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8

3.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een scheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool", een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.

a. een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, of  

b. dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat en een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.     
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt - en dienovereenkomstig belast - ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.

a. 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam (niet zijnde een maatschap of vennootschap onder firma) is dat onmiddellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b. 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen.     
3.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid laten onverlet de belastingheffìng van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
4.  De uitdrukking „dividenden", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit winstdelende obligaties en inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid: 

a. is de Bank van Bangladesh vrijgesteld van Nederlandse belasting ter zake van uit Nederland afkomstige interest;  

b. is De Nederlandse Bank vrijgesteld van belasting van Bangladesh ter zake van uit Bangladesh afkomstige interest;  

c. is de Regering van een Verdragsluitende Staat vrijgesteld van belasting in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van uit die andere Staat afkomstige interest;  

d. is interest afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat en betaald ter zake van een lening aangegaan, gegarandeerd of verzekerd door de Regering van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, de Centrale Bank van de andere Staat of door enig agentschap dat of enige instantie (waaronder begrepen een financiële instelling) die eigendom is van of wordt beheerst door de Regering van de andere Staat, vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat;  

e. is interest afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat krachtens een financieringsovereenkomst of uit hoofde van uitstel van betaling verband houdende met de verkoop van nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting of met de constructie van installaties voor nijverheids- en handelsdoeleinden of wetenschappelijke doeleinden dan wel met openbare werken, vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat.     
4.  De uitdrukking „interest", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen.

In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Interest wordt geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn, indien deze wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.

2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De uitdrukking „royalty's", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap, waaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms, films- of beeld- en geluidsbanden voor radio- of televisie-uitzendingen, een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.

De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
5.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
6.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.

3.  Vermogenswinsten verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  23  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Bangladesh mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, vijfde lid, artikel 11, vijfde lid, artikel 12, vierde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste en derde lid, artikel 16, artikel 19 en artikel 22, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Bangladesh mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomensbestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde bestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 8, tweede lid, artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 13, vijfde lid, artikel 17 en artikel 18, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Bangladesh mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Bangladesh over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
4.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere tegemoetkoming verleend op grond van de bepalingen van de wetgeving van Bangladesh ter bevordering van investeringen in Bangladesh, de in feite geheven belasting van Bangladesh op uit Bangladesh afkomstige interest en royalty's minder bedraagt dan de belasting die Bangladesh ingevolge artikel 11, tweede lid, en artikel 12, tweede lid, mag heffen, wordt het bedrag van de in Bangladesh over die interest en royalty's betaalde belasting geacht te zijn betaald naar de in voornoemde bepalingen vermelde tarieven. Indien evenwel de ingevolge de wetgeving van Bangladesh op vorengenoemde interest en royalty's van toepassing zijnde algemene belastingtarieven worden verlaagd beneden die welke in de voorafgaande zin zijn genoemd, gelden voor de toepassing van die zin deze lagere tarieven. De bepalingen van de twee voorgaande zinnen zijn slechts van toepassing gedurende een tijdvak van tien jaar na de datum waarop het Verdrag in werking is getreden. Dit tijdvak kan in onderling overleg tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten worden verlengd.   
5.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de wetgeving van Bangladesh die betrekking hebben op de verrekening van belasting die in een gebied buiten Bangladesh verschuldigd is, met belasting van Bangladesh (welke bepalingen het algemene beginsel van het hierna volgende niet mogen aantasten), mag belasting die krachtens de wetgeving van Nederland en in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag verschuldigd is over uit Nederlandse bronnen verkregen inkomsten, voordelen of vermogenswinsten worden verrekend met belasting van Bangladesh berekend over dezelfde inkomsten, voordelen of vermogenswinsten als die waarover de Nederlandse belasting wordt berekend. Voor de toepassing van dit lid worden bij de vaststelling van de belastingen naar het inkomen betaald aan Nederland, de investeringsbijdragen en -toeslagen en de desinvesteringsbetalingen, als bedoeld in de Nederlandse Wet investeringsrekening niet in aanmerking genomen. Voor de toepassing van dit lid worden de belastingen als bedoeld in artikel 2, derde lid, onderdeel a, en vierde lid, beschouwd als belastingen naar het inkomen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  24  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Staat worden in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoners zijn van een van de Verdragsluitende Staten of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet zo worden uitgelegd, dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, zevende lid, of artikel 12, zesde lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty 's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een Verdragsluitende Staat, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  25  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Verdragsluitende Staten of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 24, eerste lid, aan die van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, voor het eerst ter kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met het Verdrag, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarin het Verdrag niet voorziet.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken. Indien voor het bereiken van overeenstemming een mondelinge gedachtenwisseling raadzaam lijkt, kan zulk een gedachtenwisseling plaatsvinden in een commissie die bestaat uit vertegenwoordigers van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten.   

### Artikel  26  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten wisselen die inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten betreffende de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is, voor zover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met het Verdrag. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een Verdragsluitende Staat ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (waaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die zich bezig houden met de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken met betrekking tot de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. Zij mogen de inlichtingen bekend maken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid zo uitgelegd dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichting opleggen: 

a. administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

b. inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn krachtens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

c. inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids- of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, of inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  27  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

1.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die leden van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van het Verdrag wordt een natuurlijke persoon die deel uitmaakt van een diplomatieke, consulaire of permanente vertegenwoordiging van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat of in een derde Staat, geacht inwoner van de zendstaat te zijn, indien hij in de zendstaat aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar zijn totale wereldinkomen is onderworpen als inwoner van die zendstaat.   
3.  Het Verdrag is niet van toepassing op internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, noch op personen die lid zijn van een diplomatieke, consulaire of permanente vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat die in een Verdragsluitende Staat verblijven en die in geen van de Verdragsluitende Staten aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar hun totale wereldinkomen zijn onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitvoeringsvoorschriften

De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede en derde lid, en artikel 12, tweede lid.  

### Artikel  29  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Dit Verdrag kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot enig deel of gebied van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden waarop het Verdrag niet van toepassing is en dat belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling of op enig andere wijze die in overeenstemming is met hun grondwettelijke bepalingen.   
2.  Tenzij anders overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van het Verdrag niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van het Verdrag tot enig deel of gebied waartoe zij ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VI

### Nr.  I  

Dhaka, 13 juli 1993 Excellentie, Onder verwijzing naar artikel 3 van het heden tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Volksrepubliek Bangladesh ondertekende verdrag tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen, heb ik de eer nader te verklaren dat het sluiten van dit verdrag niet de positie van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden met betrekking tot de zeegrenzen van de Volksrepubliek Bangladesh aantast. Met betrekking tot de belastingheffing van inkomsten uit scheepvaart heeft Bangladesh er mee ingestemd de onderhandelingen met Nederland te heropenen teneinde een behandeling overeen te komen die soortgelijk is aan welke gunstiger behandeling ook van inkomsten uit scheepvaart die na de ondertekening in Dhaka van het Memorandum van Overeenstemming door de leiders van de delegaties op 16 januari 1992 door Bangladesh wordt verleend ingevolge een verdrag of andere overeenkomst met een ander land. Met betrekking tot de bronheffing op interest heeft Bangladesh er eveneens mee ingestemd de onderhandelingen met Nederland te heropenen teneinde een behandeling overeen te komen die soortgelijk is aan welke gunstiger behandeling ook die door Bangladesh wordt verleend ingevolge een verdrag of andere overeenkomst met een ander land ter zake van interest die wordt ontvangen door een bank of enige andere financiële instelling (een verzekeringsmaatschappij daaronder begrepen). Ik zal het op prijs stellen indien u zou willen bevestigen dat u met het bovenstaande kunt instemmen. In dat geval zullen deze nota en Uwe Excellentie's nota van antwoord worden beschouwd als een integrerend deel van dit verdrag en zij zullen inwerking treden op de datum van inwerkingtreding van het verdrag. Gelief, Excellentie, de verzekering van mijn zeer bijzondere hoogachting wel te willen aanvaarden. (w.g.) H. GAJENTAAN H.

Dhaka, 13 juli 1993 Excellentie, Ik heb de eer de ontvangst te bevestigen van uw nota, gedateerd heden, die als volgt luidt:  (zoals in Nr. I  Ik heb de eer Uwe Excellentie ter kennis te brengen dat ik het bovenstaande onderschrijf en te bevestigen dat de nota van Uwe Excellentie en deze nota van antwoord zullen worden beschouwd als een integrerend deel van dit verdrag en dat zij in werking zullen treden op de datum van inwerkingtreding van het verdrag. Gelief, Excellentie, de verzekering van mijn zeer bijzondere hoogachting wel te willen aanvaarden. (w.g.)
