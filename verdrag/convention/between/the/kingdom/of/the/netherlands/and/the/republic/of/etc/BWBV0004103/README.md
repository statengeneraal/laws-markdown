6.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden betaald door het lichaam aan personen die geen Inwoner zijn van die andere Staat, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.

3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel is interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan de Regering van de andere Staat of aan een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan, aan de Centrale Bank van die andere Staat dan wel aan een agentschap of instantie (daaronder begrepen een financiële instelling) die geheel eigendom is van die Regering of die Centrale Bank dan wel van beide, vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit overheidsleningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst, en schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, alsmede alle andere inkomsten die door de belastingwetgeving van dé Staat waaruit de inkomsten afkomstig zijn, met inkomsten uit geldlening worden gelijkgesteld.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is, een vaste inrichting heeft en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest verschuldigd is, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In een zodanig geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing.   
6.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan zij wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty’s

1.  Royalty’s afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty’s mogen echter in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar de aldus geheven belasting mag niet overschrijden: 

a) 15 percent van het bruto-bedrag ervan, indien het royalty’s betreft zoals omschreven in het derde lid, letter a); en  

b) 10 percent van het bruto-bedrag ervan, indien het royalty’s betreft zoals omschreven in het derde lid, letter b).     
3.  De uitdruking „royalty’s”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van:

b) een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een ontwerp, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, nijverheids-, handels- of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.     
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de royalty’s, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty’s afkomstig zijn, een vaste inrichting heeft en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty’s verschuldigd zijn, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In een zodanig geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing.   
5.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting heeft waarvoor het contract op grond waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, was gesloten, en deze royalty’s ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd.   
6.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het. bedrag van de betaalde royalty’s, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13

Internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, alsmede personen die deel uitmaken van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat, die in een van de Staten verblijven, hebben in de andere Staat geen recht op de vermindering of vrijstelling van belasting voorzien in de artikelen 10, 11 en 12, met betrekking tot uit die andere Staat afkomstige bestanddelen van het inkomen die in deze artikelen zijn behandeld, indien die bestanddelen van het inkomen in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan een belasting naar het inkomen zijn onderworpen.

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

### Artikel  23  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Korea mogen worden belast.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de toepassing van de bepalingen betreffende de verliescompensatie in de eenzijdige voorschriften tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting, verleent Nederland een vermindering op het overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel berekende belastingbedrag. Deze vermindering is gelijk aan dat gedeelte van dat belastingbedrag dat tot dat belastingbedrag in dezelfde verhouding staat als het gedeelte van het inkomen dat in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag is begrepen, en dat volgens de artikelen 6 en 7, artikel 10, vijfde lid, artikel 11, vijfde lid, artikel 12, vierde lid, artikel 14, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 15, artikel 16, eerste lid, artikel 17, eerste lid, en artikel 20 van deze Overeenkomst in Korea mag worden belast, staat tot het bedrag van het gehele inkomen dat de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag vormt.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een vermindering op de overeenkomstig de voorgaande leden van dit artikel berekende belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 18, en artikel 19, tweede en derde lid, in Korea mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze vermindering is het laagste van de volgende bedragen: 

a) het bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Korea geheven belasting;  

b) het bedrag van de Nederlandse belasting dat tot het overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel berekende belastingbedrag in dezelfde verhouding staat als het bedrag van de genoemde bestanddelen van het inkomen staat tot het bedrag van het inkomen dat de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag vormt.     
4.  Korea staat een inwoner van Korea toe met de Koreaanse belasting te verrekenen het bedrag dat past bij de belasting die aan Nederland is betaald of moet worden betaald. Het bedrag dat daarbij past gaat uit van het bedrag aan belasting dat aan Nederland is betaald of moet worden betaald, doch overschrijdt niet dat deel van de Koreaanse belasting dat tot die belasting in dezelfde verhouding staat als het inkomen dat ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nederland mag worden belast, staat tot het gehele inkomen dat aan Koreaanse belasting is onderworpen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  24  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten, of zij inwoner zijn van die Staat of niet, worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van die eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
4.  In dit artikel ziet de uitdrukking „belastingheffing” op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  25  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een inwoner van een van de Staten van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van de beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, onverminderd de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, te vermijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarvoor in deze Overeenkomst geen voorziening is getroffen.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  26  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen zodanige inlichtingen uit (zijnde inlichtingen die deze autoriteiten geordend voorhanden hebben) als nodig zijn om uitvoering te geven aan deze Overeenkomst, in het bijzonder om fraude te voorkomen. Elke aldus uitgewisselde inlichting wordt geheim gehouden en niet ter kennis gebracht van andere personen of autoriteiten, daaronder begrepen een rechterlijke instantie, dan die belast met de vaststelling of invordering van, of met de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen die het onderwerp van deze Overeenkomst uitmaken.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid aldus uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a) administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b) bijzonderheden te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn volgens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c) inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids- of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, dan wel inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  27  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaren en beambten ontlenen aan de algemene regelen van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  28  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot de Nederlandse Antillen, indien dat land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum, en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, daaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van de Overeenkomst zelf niet met zich mede, dat de uitbreiding van de Overeenkomst tot de Nederlandse Antillen wordt beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####SLOTBEPALINGEN

Elk van de Staten kan de Overeenkomst langs diplomatieke weg opzeggen door tenminste zes maanden voor het einde van enig kalenderjaar dat aanvangt na het verstrijken van een tijdvak van vijf jaren sedert de datum van inwerkingtreding ervan een kennisgeving van beëindiging te zenden. In dat geval houdt de Overeenkomst op van toepassing te zijn:

Met betrekking tot artikel 2, eerste lid, letter b) van de Overeenkomst is het wel te verstaan dat de Koreaanse verdedigingsbelasting, voor zover deze wordt geheven in samenhang met de inkomstenbelasting of de vennootschapsbelasting, eveneens onderwerp is van deze Overeenkomst.  

### II  

####Ad Artikel 10

De bepaling van artikel 10, tweede lid, letter a), vindt geen toepassing, indien het lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland, ter zake van de dividenden die het ontvangt van het lichaam dat inwoner is van Korea, Nederlandse vennootschapsbelasting verschuldigd is.

De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede en derde lid, en van artikel 12, tweede lid.

####Ad Artikel 17

Het is wel te verstaan dat de uitdrukking „bestuurder” of „commissaris” van een Nederlands lichaam slaat op personen, die als zodanig zijn benoemd door de algemene vergadering van aandeelhouders van dat lichaam en zijn belast met de algemene leiding van het lichaam, onderscheidenlijk met het toezicht daarop.
