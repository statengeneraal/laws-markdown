Profits realised from the carriage of passengers, excess baggage, mail, livestock or goods which are brought to that other State solely for transhipments, or for transfer from one aircraft to another or from an aircraft to a ship or from a ship to an aircraft shall not be included. Profits from chartered flights originating from that other State shall be deemed to be derived from that State regardless of the place of sale of the passage documents.

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State,   and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.  

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient is a company the capital of which is wholly or partly divided into shares and which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.     
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.   
5.  The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, "jouissance" shares or "jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as income from debt-claims participating in profits and income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
6.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State, of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State professional services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
7.  If a resident of one of the States has a permanent establishment in the other State, this permanent establishment may be subject to an additional tax on the profits remitted by that permanent establishment to its head office in accordance with the law of the last-mentioned State, but the additional tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the amount of the remitted profits. This provision shall not apply to profits mentioned in Article 8.   
8.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   

### Article  11  

####Interests

1.  Interest arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed: 

a) 10 per cent of the gross amount if such interest is paid: 

(i) in connection with the sale on credit of any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or  

(ii) on any loan of whatever kind granted by a bank, or any other financial institution,

b) interest arising in one of the States and paid in respect of a loan made by or guaranteed or insured by the Government of the other State, the central bank of that other State or any agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) owned or controlled by that Government shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State.     
4.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2 and 3.   
5.  The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from Government securities, bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage but not carrying a right to participate in profits, and debt-claims of every kind as well as all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
6.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the recipient of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on in the other State in which the interest arises, a trade or business through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State professional services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
7.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
8.  Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  12

1.  Royalties arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties where the royalties are paid by an enterprise registered, and engaged in preferred areas of activities in that State; and  

b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties in all other cases.     
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.   
4.  The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and those royalties are borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
7.  Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

### Article  22  

####Elimination of Double Taxation

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Philippines.   
2.  Without prejudice to the application of the provisions concerning the compensation of losses in the unilateral regulations for the avoidance of double taxation, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 6 of Article 10, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraph 1 of Article 15, paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 16, paragraph 2 of Article 18 and Article 19 of this Convention may be taxed in the Philippines and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a proportionate reduction of its tax. This reduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Netherlands tax as computed before the reduction is given, which is otherwise due on the said items of income.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 8, paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12 and Article 17 of this Convention may be taxed in the Philippines to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in the Philippines on these items of income, but shall not exceed that part of the Netherlands tax which is otherwise due on the said items of income.   
4.  For the purposes of paragraph 3, where the Philippine tax actually paid on interest and royalties arising in the Philippines is lower than 15 per cent, then, the tax paid in the Philippines on these items of income shall be deemed to be 15 per cent.   
5.  Subject to the existing provisions of the laws of the Philippines of tax paid outside the Philippines and to subsequent modifications of those provisions - which shall not affect the general principles thereof - tax payable under the laws of the Netherlands on profits, income or gains arising in the Netherlands shall be deducted from any Philippine tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains. The deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Philippine income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is otherwise due on the income which may be taxed in the Netherlands.   
6.  If a resident of one of the States derives gains which may be taxed in the other State in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 13, that other State shall allow a deduction from its tax on such gains to an amount equal to the tax levied in the first-mentioned State on the said gains.   

### Article  23  

####Non-Discrimination

1.  The nationals of one of the States shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging one of the States to grant to residents of the other State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 7 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  In this Article the term "taxation" means taxes of every kind and description.   
6.  With respect to the taxes referred to in Article 2, nothing in this Article shall prevent the Philippines from limiting to its citizens or corporations the enjoyment of tax incentives granted under Article 44 of Presidential Decree No. 1789, as amended by P. B. No. 391, otherwise known as the Investment Policy Act.   

### Article  24  

####Mutual Agreement Procedure

1.  Where a resident of one of the States considers that the actions of one or both of the States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the State of which he is a national. This case must be presented within two years from the first notification of the action giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. A State is not obliged to implement an agreement reached after the expiration of five years from the end of the taxable year in issue.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation, or the prevention of fiscal evasion in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   

### Article  25  

####Exchange of Information

1.  The competent authorities of the States shall exchange such information (being information which such authorities have in proper order at their disposal) as is necessary for the carrying out of this Convention, in particular for the prevention of fraud, and for the administration of statutory provisions against legal avoidance concerning taxes covered by this Convention. Any information received by the competent authority of one of the States shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Convention applies and shall be used only for such purposes.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.     

### Article  26

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - waaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Bij de toepassing van het derde lid wordt, met uitzondering van bedragen wegens werkelijk gemaakte kosten, geen aftrek toegestaan ter zake van bedragen die door het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren aan de vaste inrichting in rekening worden gebracht als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooien of andere rechten, of als commissieloon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan de vaste inrichting ter beschikking zijn gesteld. Evenmin zal bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting rekening worden gehouden met zodanige bedragen - met uitzondering van die wegens werkelijk gemaakte kosten - die door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren in rekening worden gebracht.

6.  In het geval van voordelen uit toezicht, levering, installatie-, of constructiewerkzaamheden wordt alleen dat deel daarvan aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend, dat voortvloeit uit het werkelijk verrichten van deze werkzaamheden door middel van die vaste inrichting.   
7.  Vergoedingen ontvangen door een onderneming van een van de Staten voor het in de andere Staat verrichten van technische diensten, waaronder begrepen studies of toezichthoudende werkzaamheden van wetenschappelijke, geologische of technische aard, of voor contracten inzake bouw- of constructiewerkzaamheden en de daarop betrekking hebbende blauwdrukken, of voor diensten van raadgevende of toezichthoudende aard, worden beschouwd als voordelen van een onderneming waarop de bepalingen van dit artikel van toepassing zijn.

9.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.

####Zeevaart en luchtvaart

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een onderneming van een van de Staten uit de exploitatie van schepen en luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer, mogen in die Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze voordelen mogen echter ook in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts voorzover deze voordelen uit die andere Staat worden verkregen. De aldus geheven belasting mag het laagste van de volgende tarieven niet overschrijden: 

a) het tarief van 1½ procent over de uit die andere Staat verkregen bruto-opbrengst, of  

b) het laagste tarief van de Filippijnse belasting over deze door een onderneming van een derde Staat verkregen voordelen.     
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel worden onder voordelen, verkregen uit de andere Staat, verstaan voordelen zoals die ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van die andere Staat worden vastgesteld en die worden behaald met het vervoer van passagiers, overbagage, post, levende have of goederen die in die andere Staat aan boord worden gebracht of geladen door een scheepvaartonderneming die in die andere Staat zaken doet, indien de vervoersdocumenten aldaar zijn verkocht, dan wel worden behaald met het aan boord brengen of laden, ongeacht waar ter wereld dit plaatsvindt, door een internationale luchtvaartonderneming die in die andere Staat zaken doet, indien de vervoersdocumenten aldaar zijn verkocht, mits in deze gevallen de post, levende have of goederen afkomstig zijn uit die andere Staat. Voordelen behaald met het vervoer van personen, overbagage, post, levende have of goederen die naar die andere Staat worden gebracht uitsluitend voor overscheping of voor overlading van het ene in het andere vliegtuig of van een vliegtuig in een schip of van een schip in een vliegtuig, worden daaronder niet begrepen. Voordelen uit gecharterde vluchten die afkomstig zijn uit die andere Staat worden geacht uit die Staat te zijn verkregen, ongeacht de plaats van verkoop van de vervoersdocumenten. Bij de vaststelling van de belastbaarheid van voordelen uit gecharterde vluchten worden onder de uitdrukking „die afkomstig zijn uit die andere Staat mede begrepen vluchten van passagiers die voorafgaand aan het aan boord gaan langer dan 48 uur in die andere Staat verblijven.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste, het tweede en het derde lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool, een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

a) een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b) dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat,   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.  

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt, inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de genieter een lichaam is waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk in aandelen is verdeeld en dat onmiddellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b) 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen.     
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid laten onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
5.  De uitdrukking „dividenden, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst en inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de belastingwetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet, inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat een vrij beroep uitoefent vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
7.  Indien een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat een vaste inrichting heeft, mag deze vaste inrichting in overeenstemming met de wetgeving van de laatstbedoelde Staat worden onderworpen aan een additionele belasting over de door die vaste inrichting aan haar hoofdkantoor overgemaakte voordelen, maar deze aldus geheven additionele belasting mag 10 percent van het bedrag van de overgemaakte voordelen niet overschrijden. Deze bepaling is niet van toepassing op voordelen zoals genoemd in artikel 8.   
8.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen over de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Staat waaruit hij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 10 percent van het brutobedrag, indien deze interest wordt betaald: 

(i) in verband met de verkoop op krediet van enige nijverheids-, handels- of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of  

(ii) op een lening van welke soort dan ook, verstrekt door een bank of enige andere financiële instelling,  

(iii) ter zake van in het openbaar uitgegeven obligaties, schuldbewijzen of soortgelijke verplichtingen;    

b) 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest in alle andere gevallen.     
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid: 

a) is interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald ter zake van een obligatie, schuldbewijs of een andere soortgelijke verplichting van de Regering van die Staat of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan, vrijgesteld van belasting in die Staat;  

b) is interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald ter zake van een lening aangegaan, gegarandeerd of verzekerd door de Regering van die andere Staat, de centrale bank van die andere Staat of door enig agentschap dat of enige instantie (waaronder begrepen een financiële instelling) die eigendom is van of wordt beheerst door die Regering, vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat.     
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede en derde lid.   
5.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit overheidsleningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek, doch niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst, en schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, alsmede alle andere inkomsten die door de belastingwetgeving van de Staat waaruit de inkomsten afkomstig zijn, met inkomsten uit geldlening worden gelijkgesteld. In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de genieter van de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat een vrij beroep uitoefent vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
7.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien deze wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de schuld terzake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
8.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de genieter of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de genieter zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot die royalty's is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's, indien de royalty's worden betaald door een geregistreerde onderneming die activiteiten ontplooit in speciaal daarvoor aangewezen gebieden in die Staat;  

b) 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's in alle andere gevallen.     
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De uitdrukking „royalty's”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap, waaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms of banden voor radio- of televisie-uitzendingen, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, of voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de royalty's, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat een vrij beroep uitoefent vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de genieter of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de genieter zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13  

####Voordelen uit de vervreemding van zaken

1.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van onroerende goederen, zoals bedoeld in artikel 6, tweede lid, mogen worden belast in de Staat waarin deze goederen zijn gelegen.   
2.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende zaken die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, of van roerende zaken die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor de uitoefening van een vrij beroep, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of tezamen met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, zijn voordelen verkregen door een onderneming van een van de Staten uit de vervreemding van schepen en luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd en roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, slechts belastbaar in die Staat.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere zaken dan die welke zijn bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  De bepalingen van het vierde lid tasten niet aan het recht van elk van de Staten overeenkomstig zijn nationale wetgeving belasting te heffen op voordelen uit de vervreemding van zaken verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner van de andere Staat is en in de zes jaar, onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de zaken, te eniger tijd inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest.   

### Artikel  14  

####Zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten in de uitoefening van een vrij beroep of terzake van andere zelfstandige werkzaamheden van soortgelijke aard, zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij hij in de andere Staat voor het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden geregeld over een vast middelpunt beschikt. Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep omvat in het bijzonder zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.   

### Artikel  15  

####Niet-zelfstandige arbeid

Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een in de andere Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstbedoelde Staat belastbaar, indien:

2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing op inkomsten verkregen uit werkzaamheden verricht in een van de Staten door artiesten en sportbeoefenaars indien het bezoek aan die Staat in hoofdzaak wordt bekostigd uit de openbare middelen van de andere Staat, waaronder begrepen een staatkundig onderdeel, plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of staatsrechtelijk orgaan daarvan, noch op door een instelling zonder winstoogmerk ter zake van zulke werkzaamheden verkregen inkomsten, mits die inkomsten in genen dele betaalbaar zijn aan, of anderszins ten goede komen aan een eigenaar, lid, of aandeelhouder van die instelling, en door de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat wordt verklaard dat de organisatie voor toepassing van deze bepaling in aanmerking komt.   

### Artikel  18  

####Pensioenen en lijfrenten

1.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het tweede lid van dit artikel en van artikel 19, eerste lid, zijn pensioenen en andere soortgelijke beloningen betaald ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking aan een inwoner van een van de Staten en elke lijfrente betaald aan zulk een inwoner, slechts in die Staat belastbaar.

### Artikel  19  

####Overheidsfuncties

1.  Beloningen, waaronder begrepen pensioenen, betaald door, of uit fondsen in het leven geroepen door, een van de Staten of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan aan een natuurlijke persoon ter zake van diensten bewezen aan die Staat of aan dat onderdeel of dat plaatselijke publiekrechtelijke lichaam daarvan in de uitoefening van overheidsfuncties, mogen in die Staat worden belast.

2.  Dit artikel is niet van toepassing op inkomsten uit het verrichten van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, indien dit onderzoek niet wordt verricht in het algemeen belang, maar in de eerste plaats voor het persoonlijke nut van een bepaalde persoon of bepaalde personen.   

### Artikel  21  

####Studenten

1.  Een natuurlijke persoon, die onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan zijn bezoek aan een van de Staten inwoner is van de andere Staat en die tijdelijk in de eerstbedoelde Staat verblijf houdt in de eerste plaats met de bedoeling: 

a) aan een erkende universiteit, hogeschool of school in die eerstbedoelde Staat te studeren, of  

b) een opleiding voor een bedrijf of beroep te volgen, is vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat ter zake van: 

(i) alle overmakingen uit het buitenland ten behoeve van zijn onderhoud, studie of opleiding, en  

(ii) alle beloningen voor persoonlijke diensten verricht in de eerstbedoelde Staat tot een bedrag dat, naar gelang van het geval, een bedrag van 5000 Nederlandse guldens of de tegenwaarde daarvan in Filippijnse valuta in enig belastingjaar niet te boven gaat.     De voordelen ingevolge dit lid worden slechts verleend voor een tijdsduur die redelijk wordt geacht of gewoonlijk is vereist om het doel van het bezoek te bereiken.   
2.  Een natuurlijke persoon, die onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan zijn bezoek aan een van de Staten inwoner is van de andere Staat en die tijdelijk in de eerstbedoelde Staat verblijf houdt gedurende een tijdvak van niet langer dan drie jaar met de bedoeling te studeren, wetenschappelijk onderzoek te verrichten of een opleiding te volgen, zulks uitsluitend als genieter van een beurs, toelage of prijs verleend door een organisatie op het gebied van wetenschap, onderwijs, godsdienst of liefdadigheid of op grond van een programma van technische hulpverlening waaraan een van de Staten, een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan heeft deelgenomen, is vrijgesteld van belasting in de eerstbedoelde Staat voor:

b) alle beloningen voor persoonlijke diensten, verricht in de eerstbedoelde Staat, mits die diensten verband houden met zijn studie, onderzoek of opleiding of daaruit voortvloeien en de duur van die diensten een totaal van 183 dagen in enig belastingjaar niet te boven gaat.     

### Artikel  22  

####Vermijden van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in de Filippijnen mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, zesde lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste lid, artikel 16, eerste en derde lid, artikel 18, tweede lid, en artikel 19 van deze Overeenkomst in de Filippijnen mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomensbestanddelen vrij door een evenredige vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan, onder voorbehoud van de toepassing van de bepalingen betreffende de verliescompensatie in de eenzijdige voorschriften tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Deze vermindering bedraagt echter niet meer dan het vóór de toekenning van de vermindering berekende deel van de Nederlandse belasting die anders over de genoemde inkomensbestanddelen zou zijn verschuldigd.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 8, tweede lid, artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, en artikel 17 van deze Overeenkomst in de Filippijnen mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in de Filippijnen over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar overschrijdt niet dat deel van de Nederlandse belasting, dat anders over de genoemde bestanddelen van het inkomen zou zijn verschuldigd.   
4.  Indien de in feite betaalde Filippijnse belasting op uit de Filippijnen afkomstige interest en royalty's lager is dan 15 percent, wordt de in de Filippijnen over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting voor de toepassing van het derde lid geacht 15 percent te bedragen.   
5.  Met inachtneming van de bestaande bepalingen van de wetgeving van de Filippijnen inzake belasting die verschuldigd is buiten de Filippijnen en met inachtneming van toekomstige wijzigingen van die bepalingen - welke bepalingen de algemene beginselen daarvan niet mogen aantasten - wordt de belasting die ingevolge de Nederlandse wetgeving is verschuldigd over uit Nederland afkomstige voordelen of inkomsten, in vermindering gebracht op de Filippijnse belasting die ter zake van die voordelen of inkomsten is verschuldigd. Deze vermindering bedraagt echter niet meer dan het vóór de toekenning van de vermindering berekende deel van de Filippijnse inkomstenbelasting die anders zou zijn verschuldigd over de inkomsten die in Nederland mogen worden belast.   
6.  Indien een inwoner van een van de Staten voordelen verkrijgt die ingevolge artikel 13, vijfde lid, in de andere Staat mogen worden belast, verleent die andere Staat een vermindering op zijn belasting over deze voordelen tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de belasting die in de eerstbedoelde Staat over die voordelen is geheven.   

### Artikel  23  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of de gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, artikel 11, achtste lid, of artikel 12, zevende lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij zouden zijn betaald aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere, soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  In dit artikel heeft de uitdrukking „belastingheffing” betrekking op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   
6.  Met betrekking tot de belastingen, zoals bedoeld in artikel 2, belet niets in dit artikel de Filippijnen om de investeringsfaciliteiten die worden verleend ingevolge artikel 44 van het Presidentieel Besluit (Presidential Decree) Nr. 1789, zoals gewijzigd bij B.P. Nr. 391, ook wel bekend als de Wet Investeringsbeleid (Investment Policy Act), te beperken tot hun onderdanen of ondernemingen.   

### Artikel  24  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een inwoner van een van de Staten van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, onverminderd de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 23, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen twee jaar nadat de maatregel die aanleiding geeft tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de Overeenkomst, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een passende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de Overeenkomst, te vermijden. Een Staat is niet verplicht de bereikte overeenstemming uit te voeren na het verstrijken van een periode van vijf jaar na het einde van het desbetreffende belastingjaar.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken of het ontgaan van belasting te voorkomen in gevallen waarin de Overeenkomst niet voorziet.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming, als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden, te bereiken.   

### Artikel  25  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

### Protocol  

Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting en het voorkomen van het ontgaan van belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen, heden tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek der Filippijnen gesloten, zijn de ondergetekenden overeengekomen dat de volgende bepalingen een integrerend deel van de Overeenkomst vormen.  

### I  

####Ad artikel 3

De bevoegde autoriteiten bepalen in onderlinge overeenstemming de toepassing van de Overeenkomst op een nalatenschap als bedoeld in artikel 3, eerste lid, onderdeel d.  

### II  

####Ad artikel 9

Het is wel verstaan dat overeenkomsten tot verdeling van kosten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten niet reeds op zichzelf duiden op handelingen die tussen onafhankelijke partijen niet gebruikelijk zijn.  

### III  

####Ad artikel 10

De bepalingen van artikel 10, tweede lid, onderdeel a, zijn niet van toepassing indien het lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland, Nederlandse vennootschapsbelasting is verschuldigd ter zake van de dividenden die het ontvangt van het lichaam dat inwoner is van de Filippijnen. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 10, tweede lid, onderdeel b, van toepassing.  

### IV  

####Ad artikelen 10, 11 en 12

Verzoeken om teruggaaf van belasting die niet in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van de artikelen 10, 11 of 12 is geheven en betaald, moeten bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven, worden ingediend binnen een tijdvak van twee jaar nadat de belasting is geheven en betaald.  

### V  

####Ad artikel 22

a).  Het is wel verstaan dat, wat de Nederlandse inkomstenbelasting of vennootschapsbelasting betreft, de grondslag als bedoeld in artikel 22, eerste lid, is het onzuivere inkomen of de winst in de zin van de Nederlandse wetten op de inkomstenbelasting, onderscheidenlijk de vennootschapsbelasting.   
b).  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 22, vierde lid, wordt, wat royalty's betreft, het in dat lid genoemde percentage verhoogd met 5 percent zolang de Filippijnse nationale wetgeving voorziet in een bronbelasting op royalty's die niet lager is dan 35 percent.
