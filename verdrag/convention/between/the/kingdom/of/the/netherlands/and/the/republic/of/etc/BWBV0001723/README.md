b) the furnishing of services including consulting services by an enterprise of a Contracting State through employees or other personnel engaged in the other Contracting State provided that such activities continue for the same or a connected project for a period or periods aggregating more than four months within any twelve months period.     
4.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: 

a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.   
6.  An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.   
7.  The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6  

####Income from immovable property

1.  Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  The term ``immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources.

3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.   

### Article  7  

####Business profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment of amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary. The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####Shipping and air transport

1.  Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.   
2.  If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
3.  For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the operation in international traffic of ships and aircraft include: 

a) profits derived from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships and aircraft if operated in international traffic if such rental profits are an occasional source of income to the profits described in paragraph 1;  

b) profits derived from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers, barges and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods and merchandise in international traffic if such profits are an occasional source of income to the profits described in paragraph 1.     
4.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated enterprises

1.  Where 

a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,   and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.   
2.  Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident: 

a) shall not levy a tax on dividends paid by that company, if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company the capital of which is wholly or partly divided into shares and which is a resident of the other Contracting State and holds directly at least 50 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends with respect to investments – including expansion of (current) investments – made after the entry into force of this convention;  

b) may levy a tax not exceeding 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly divided into shares and that holds directly less than 50 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends.     
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2 and 3.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.   
6.  The term ``dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, ``jouissance" shares or ``jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
7.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 9 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
8.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   
9.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 8, dividends paid by a company whose capital is divided into shares and which under the laws of a State is a resident of that State, to an individual who is a resident of the other State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State in accordance with the laws of that State if that individual-holds shares in the issued capital of a particular class of shares in that company. This provision shall apply only if the individual to whom the dividend is paid has been a resident of the first-mentioned State in the course of the last ten years preceding the year in which the dividend is paid and provided that, at the time he became a resident of the other State, the above-mentioned conditions regarding share ownership in the said company were satisfied. In cases where, under the domestic laws of the first-mentioned State, an assessment has been issued to the individual to whom the dividend is paid in respect of the alienation of the aforesaid shares deemed to have taken place at the time of his emigration from the first-mentioned State, the above shall apply only as long as part of the assessment is still outstanding.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contacting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State if it is paid in respect of a loan of any kind 

a) granted or guaranteed by the government, a political subdivision or local authority, or an agency of the other Contracting State or the Central Bank of the other Contracting State;  

b) 

(i) granted by a bank,  

(ii) granted by a financial institution of a public character, provided that in the case of this sub-paragraph the loan repayment period is 3 years or more.       
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2 and 3.   
5.  The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
6.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
7.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   
8.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  12  

####Royalties

1.  Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.   
4.  The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
6.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

3.  Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, as well as gains from the alienation of containers (including trailers, barges and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods and merchandise in international traffic to which subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 of Article 8 applies, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship then, for the purposes of this paragraph, it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
4.  Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.   
5.

Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.   
3.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from activities exercised in the other Contracting State if the visit to that other State is supported wholly or mainly by public funds of one or both of the Contracting States , a political subdivision or a local authority thereof, or takes place under a cultural agreement between the Governments of the Contracting States.

c) if the total gross amount of the pensions and other similar remuneration and annuities, and any pension and other payment paid out under the provisions of a social security system of a Contracting State, in any calendar year exceeds the sum of 10.000 Euro.     
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, if this pension or other similar remuneration is not periodic in nature, is paid in respect of past employment in the other Contracting State and is paid out before the date on which the pension commences, or if a lump-sum payment is made in lieu of the right to an annuity before the date on which the annuity commences, the payment or this lump-sum may also be taxed in the Contracting State from which it is derived.   
4.  A pension or other similar remuneration or annuity is deemed to be derived from a Contracting State if and insofar as the contributions or payments associated with the pension or other similar remuneration or annuity, or the entitlements received from it qualified for tax relief in that State. The transfer of a pension from a pension fund or an insurance company in a Contracting State to a pension fund or an insurance company in another State will not restrict in any way the taxing rights of the first-mentioned State under this Article.   
5.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2. They shall also decide what details the resident of a Contracting State must submit for the purpose of the proper application of the Convention in the other Contracting State, in particular so that it can be established whether the conditions referred in subparagraphs a), b) and c) of paragraph 2 have been met.   
6.  The term “annuity” means a stated sum payable periodically at stated times during life or during a specified or ascertainable period of time under an obligation to make the payments in return for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.   
7.  Whether and to what extent a pension or similar remuneration falls under this Article or under Article 18, is determined by the nature of the past employment, as private or governmental, during which the entitlement to that part of the pension or similar remuneration was built up.   

### Article  18  

####Government service

1. 
a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority may be taxed in that State.  

b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: 

(i) is a national of that State; or  

(ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services.       
2.  

a) Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority may be taxed in that State.  

b) However, such pension shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State.     
3.  The provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 17 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration and to pensions in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof.   

### Article  19  

####Professors and teachers

1.  Payments which a professor or teacher who is a resident of a Contracting State and who is present in the other Contracting State for the purpose of teaching or scientific research for a maximum period of two years in a university, college or other establishment for teaching or scientific research in that other State, receives for such teaching or research, shall not be taxed in that other State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State.   
2.  This Article shall not apply to income from research if such research is undertaken not in the public interest but primarily for the private benefit of a specific person or persons.   

### Article  20  

####Students

Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State.  

### Article  21  

####Other income

1.  Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.   
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

### Article  22  

####Elimination of double taxation

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Uganda.   
2.  However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 7 of Article 10, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 14, paragraph 2 of Article 17, paragraphs 1 (subparagraph a) and 2 (subparagraph a) of Article 18, paragraph 2 of Article 21 of this Convention may be taxed in Uganda and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraphs 2 and 9 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11 paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 5 of Article 13, Article 15, Article 16 and paragraph 3 of Article 17 of this Convention may be taxed in Uganda to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Uganda on these items of income, but shall, in case the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation provide so, not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. This paragraph shall not restrict allowance now or hereafter accorded by the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation, but only as far as the calculation of the amount of the reduction of Netherlands tax is concerned with respect to the aggregation of income from more than one country.   
4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax for the tax paid in Uganda on items of income which according to Article 7, paragraph 7 of Article 10, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12 and paragraph 2 of Article 21 of this Convention may be taxed in Uganda to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, if and insofar as the Netherlands under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation allows a deduction from the Netherlands tax of the tax levied in another country on such items of income. For the computation of this deduction the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply accordingly.   
5.  In Uganda, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: Where a resident of Uganda derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Netherlands, Uganda shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the Dutch tax paid. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income which may be taxed in the Netherlands.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  23  

####Offshore activities

1.  The provisions of this Article shall apply notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention. However, this Article shall not apply where offshore activities of a person constitute for that person a permanent establishment under the provisions of Article 5.   
2.  In this Article the term “offshore activities” means activities which are carried on offshore in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the seabed and its subsoil and their natural resources, situated in a Contracting State.   
3.  An enterprise of a Contracting State which carries on offshore activities in the other Contracting State shall, subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, be deemed to be carrying on, in respect of those activities, business in that other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, unless the offshore activities in question are carried on in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 30 days in any period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph: 

a) where an enterprise carrying on offshore activities in the other Contracting State is associated with another enterprise and that other enterprise continues, as part of the same project, the same offshore activities that are or were being carried on by the first-mentioned enterprise, and the aforementioned activities carried on by both enterprises – when added together – exceed a period of 30 days, then each enterprise shall be deemed to be carrying on its activities for a period exceeding 30 days in a 12 month-period;  

b) an enterprise shall be regarded as associated with another enterprise if one holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of the other enterprise or if a person holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of both enterprises.     
4.  However, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article the term “offshore activities” shall be deemed not to include: 

a) one or any combination of the activities mentioned in paragraph 4 of Article 5;  

b) towing or anchor handling by ships primarily designed for that purpose and any other activities performed by such ships;  

c) the transport of supplies or personnel by ships or aircraft in international traffic.     
5.  Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment connected with offshore activities carried on through a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State may, to the extent that the employment is exercised offshore in that other State, be taxed in that other State.   
6.  Where documentary evidence is produced that tax has been paid in Uganda on the items of income which may be taxed in Uganda according to Article 7 and Article 14 in connection with paragraph 3 of this Article and according to paragraph 5 of this Article, the Netherlands shall allow a reduction of its tax which shall be computed in conformity with the rules laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 22.   

### Article  24  

####Non-discrimination

1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. However, branch profits tax levied on income repatriated by a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be regarded as being contrary to the provisions of this paragraph. The tax so charged, however, shall not exceed 5 per cent of the repatriated income. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 7 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  Contributions paid by, or on behalf of, an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in the other Contracting State will be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in that first-mentioned State, provided that 

a) such individual was contributing to such pension plan before he became a resident of the first-mentioned State; and  

b) the competent authority of the first-mentioned State agrees that the pension plan corresponds to a pension plan recognized for tax purposes by that State.   For the purpose of this paragraph, ``pension plan" includes a pension plan created under a public social security system.   
6.  The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes to which this Convention applies.   

### Article  25  

####Mutual agreement procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   
5.  If any difficulty or doubt arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention cannot be resolved by the competent authorities of the Contracting States in a mutual agreement procedure pursuant to the previous paragraphs of this Article within a period of two years after the question was raised, the case may, at the request of either Contracting State, be submitted for arbitration, but only after fully exhausting the procedures available under paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article and provided the taxpayer or taxpayers involved agree in writing to be bound by the decision of the arbitration board. The decision of the arbitration board in a particular case shall be binding on both Contracting States and the taxpayer or taxpayers involved with respect to that case.   

### Article  26  

####Exchange of information

1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to taxes. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.   
2.  The Contracting States may release to the arbitration board, established under the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 25, such information as is necessary for carrying out the arbitration procedure. Such release of information shall be subject to the provisions of Article 28. The members of the arbitration board shall be subject to the limitations on disclosure described in paragraph 1 of this Article with respect to any information so released.   

### Article  27  

####Assistance in recovery

1.  The Contracting States agree to lend each other assistance and support with a view to the collection, in accordance with their respective laws or administrative practice, of the taxes to which this Convention shall apply and of any administrative penalties, interests and costs pertaining to the said taxes.   
2.  At the request of the applicant Contracting State the requested Contracting State shall recover tax claims of the first-mentioned State in accordance with the law and administrative practice for the recovery of its own tax claims. However, such claims do not enjoy any priority in the requested State and cannot be recovered by imprisonment for debt of the debtor. The requested State is not obliged to take any executory measures which are not provided for in the laws of the applicant State.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply only to tax claims which form the subject of an instrument permitting their enforcement in the applicant State and, unless otherwise agreed between the competent authorities, which are not contested.  However, where the claim relates to a liability to tax of a person as a non-resident of the applicant State, paragraph 2 shall only apply, unless otherwise agreed between the competent authorities, where the claim may no longer be contested.  
4.  The requested State shall not be obliged to accede to the request: 

a) if the applicant State has not pursued all means available in its own territory, except where recourse to such means would give rise to disproportionate difficulty;  

b) if and insofar as it considers the tax claim to be contrary to the provisions of this Convention or of any other agreement to which both of the States are parties.     
5.  The instrument permitting enforcement in the applicant State shall, where appropriate and in accordance with the provisions in force in the requested State, be accepted, recognised, supplemented or replaced as soon as possible after the date of the receipt of the request for assistance by an instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State.   
6.  At the request of the applicant State, the requested State shall, with a view to the recovery of an amount of tax, take measures of conservancy even if the claim is contested or is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement, in so far as such is permitted by the laws and administrative practice of the requested State.   
7.  Questions concerning any period beyond which a tax claim cannot be enforced shall be governed by the law of the applicant State. The request for assistance in the recovery shall give particulars concerning that period.   
8.  Acts of recovery carried out by the requested State in pursuance of a request for assistance, which, according to the laws of that State, would have the effect of suspending or interrupting the period mentioned in paragraph 7, shall also have this effect under the laws of the applicant State. The requested State shall inform the applicant State about such acts.   
9.  The requested State may allow deferral of payment or payment by instalments, if its laws or administrative practice permit it to do so in similar circumstances; but it shall first inform the applicant State.   
10.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by common agreement prescribe rules concerning minimum amounts of tax claims subject to a request for assistance.   
11.  The Contracting State in which tax is recovered in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall forthwith remit to the Contracting State on behalf of which the tax was collected the amount so recovered minus, where appropriate, the amount of the extraordinary costs referred to in sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 12.   
12.  It is understood that, unless otherwise agreed by the competent authorities of both Contracting States, 

a) ordinary costs incurred by a Contracting State in providing assistance shall be borne by that State,  

b) extraordinary costs incurred by a Contracting State in providing assistance shall be borne by the other State and shall be payable regardless of the amount collected on its behalf by the first-mentioned State. As soon as a Contracting State anticipates that extraordinary costs may be incurred, it shall so advise the other Contracting State and indicate the estimated amount of such costs.     
13.  The applicant State shall in any event remain responsible towards the requested State for the pecuniary consequences of acts of recovery which have been found unjustified in respect of the reality of the tax claim concerned or of the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement in the applicant State.   
14.  The competent authorities of the States shall by common agreement prescribe rules concerning the application of this Article.   

### Article  28  

####Limitation of Articles 26 and 27

In no case shall the provisions of Articles 26 and 27 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).    

### Article  29  

####Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.   
2.  For the purposes of the Convention an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission or consular post of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State or in a third State and who is a national of the sending State shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending State, if he is subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income as are residents of that State.   
3.  The Convention shall not apply to international organisations, organs and officials thereof and members of a diplomatic mission or consular post of a third State, being present in a Contracting State, if they are not subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income as are residents of that State.   

### Article  30  

####Territorial extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to either or both of the countries of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, if the country concerned imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to any country to which it has been extended under this Article.   

### CHAPTER  VI  

####FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article  31

WIJN  *For the Government of the Republic of Uganda*  P. KASENENE  

### Protocol  

At the moment of signing the Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, this day concluded between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Uganda the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.    

### I  

####Ad paragraph 1, subparagraph e) of Article 3

In case an entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes is liable as such to tax in a Contracting State, but the income of that entity is taxed in the other Contracting State as income of the participants in that entity, the competent authorities shall take such measures that on the one hand no double taxation remains, but on the other hand it is prevented that merely as a result of application of the Convention income is (partly) not subject to tax. To determine whether this is the case, the tax levied on the income of that entity is deemed to be tax levied on the income of the participants in that entity, in proportion to their participation in the capital of that entity. Insofar necessary, it may also, in addition, be determined that each participant, in proportion of his/its participation in that entity, may credit the tax levied on the income at the level of that entity (including possible withholding tax thereon of third States), with the tax that he/it is due on the same income. Furthermore, the State of residence of that entity may abandon possible taxation (up)on distribution of profit of that entity to the participants.  

### II  

####Ad Article 4

An individual living aboard a ship without any real domicile in either of the Contracting States shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which the ship has its home harbour.  

### III  

####Ad Article 4

It is understood that “short term residents” of a Contracting State, who are not subject to tax in that State on their worldwide income, are not considered as residents for the purposes of this Convention.  

### IV  

####Ad Articles 5 and 7

It is understood that no profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the use of facilities for the mere delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.  

### V  

####Ad Articles 5, 6, 7, 13 and 23

It is understood that exploration and exploitation rights of natural resources shall be regarded as immovable property situated in the Contracting State the sea bed and sub-soil of which they are related to, and that these rights shall be deemed to pertain to the property of a permanent establishment in that State. Furthermore, it is understood that the aforementioned rights include rights to interests in, or to the benefits of, assets to be produced by such exploration or exploitation.  

### VI  

####Ad Article 7

In respect of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7, where an enterprise of a Contracting State sells goods or merchandise or carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, the profits of that permanent establishment shall not be determined on the basis of the total amount received by the enterprise, but shall be determined only on the basis of that portion of the income of the enterprise that is attributable to the actual activity of the permanent establishment in respect of such sales or business. Specifically, in the case of contracts for the survey, supply, installation or construction of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or premises, or of public works, when the enterprise has a permanent establishment, the profits attributable to such permanent establishment shall not be determined on the basis of the total amount of the contract, but shall be determined only on the basis of that part of the contract that is effectively carried out by the permanent establishment in the Contracting State where the permanent establishment is situated. The profits related to that part of the contract which is carried out by the head office of the enterprise shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the enterprise is a resident.  

### VII  

####Ad Article 7

Payments received as a consideration for technical services, including studies or surveys of a scientific, geological or technical nature, or for consultancy or supervisory services shall be deemed to be payments to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.  

### VIII  

####Ad Article 9

It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as cost sharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent a Contracting State from checking the above-mentioned arrangements or agreements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.  

### IX  

####Ad Article 10

The provisions of subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 of Article 10 shall apply as long as, under the provisions of the Netherlands Company Tax Act, a company which is a resident of the Netherlands is not charged to Netherlands company tax with respect to dividends which the company receives from a company which is resident of Uganda. When investments in a Contracting State have been made before and after the entry into force of this Convention, it is understood that dividends shall, for the purpose of sub-paragraph a) of paragraph 3 of Article 10, be deemed to be derived from those investments in proportion to the ratio between those respective investments. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10, the Contracting State of which the company is a resident shall not levy a tax on dividends paid by that company, if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a pension fund referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4.  

### X  

####Ad Articles 10 and 11

Notwithstanding paragraph 6 of Article 10, it is understood that the term “dividends” also means income from debt-claims provided that the law of a Contracting State subjects this income from debt-claims to the same taxation treatment as income from shares according to a combination of the following criteria: 

– the redemption date of a loan;  

– the size of the remuneration or indebtedness of the remuneration is depending on the profit or the distributions of profits; and  

– the subordination of a loan.    

### XI  

####Ad articles 5 and 7, 10, 11 and 12

The refund shall be given within a six month period from the on which the application was submitted to the competent authority. The six month period may be extended if the Contracting States agree that the necessary documentation has not been presented to the competent authority of the first-mentioned State.  

### XII  

####Ad articles 10 and 13

It is understood that income received in connection with the (partial) liquidation of a company or a purchase of own shares by a company is treated as income from shares and not as capital gains.  

### XIII  

####Ad articles 10 and 13

It is understood that, in the case of the Netherlands, paragraph 5 of Article 13 only applies in the case of an individual who, either alone or with his or her spouse or with one of their relations by blood or marriage in the direct line, directly or indirectly holds at least 5 per cent of the issued capital of a particular class of shares of a company. It is further understood that if such an individual has a debt-claim on that company, the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 13 also apply with respect to capital gains derived by that individual from the ``alienation" of such debt-claim.  

### XIV  

####Ad Article 11

It is understood that when a person mentioned in subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 of Article 11 grants any loan through another person, the loan shall be deemed to be granted by the first-mentioned person.

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Belastingheffing naar het inkomen

### Artikel  6  

####Inkomsten uit onroerende zaken

1.  Inkomsten verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat uit onroerende zaken (waaronder begrepen voordelen uit landbouw- of bosbedrijven) die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat zijn gelegen mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  De uitdrukking „onroerende zaken" heeft de betekenis welke die uitdrukking heeft volgens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin de desbetreffende zaken zijn gelegen. De uitdrukking omvat in ieder geval de zaken die bij de onroerende zaken behoren, levende en dode have van landbouw- en bosbedrijven, rechten waarop de bepalingen van het privaatrecht betreffende de grondeigendom van toepassing zijn, vruchtgebruik van onroerende zaken en rechten op veranderlijke of vaste vergoedingen ter zake van de exploitatie, of concessie tot exploitatie, van minerale aardlagen, bronnen en andere natuurlijke rijkdommen. Schepen, boten en luchtvaartuigen worden niet als onroerende zaken beschouwd.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn van toepassing op de inkomsten verkregen uit de rechtstreekse exploitatie, uit het verhuren of verpachten, of uit elke andere vorm van exploitatie van onroerende zaken.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en derde lid zijn ook van toepassing op inkomsten uit onroerende zaken van een onderneming.   

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten, daaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten, die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders. Geen aftrek wordt echter toegestaan ter zake van bedragen (met uitzondering van die wegens vergoeding van werkelijke kosten) welke eventueel door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of van een van haar andere kantoren worden betaald als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooien of andere rechten, of als commissieloon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan de vaste inrichting zijn geleend. Evenmin wordt bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting rekening gehouden met bedragen (met uitzondering van die wegens vergoeding van werkelijke kosten) welke door de vaste inrichting aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of van haar andere kantoren in rekening worden gebracht als royalty's, vergoedingen of andere soortgelijke betalingen voor het gebruik van octrooien of andere rechten, of als commissieloon voor bepaalde diensten of voor het geven van leiding, dan wel, behalve in het geval van een onderneming die het bankbedrijf uitoefent, als interest op gelden die aan het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming of een van haar andere kantoren zijn geleend.   
4.  Voorzover het in een Verdragsluitende Staat gebruikelijk is de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet het tweede lid die Verdragsluitende Staat niet de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling. De gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van de aankoop van die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen van het inkomen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van dit Verdrag worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

####Zeevaart en luchtvaart

1.  Voordelen uit de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
2.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een scheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvatten voordelen behaald met de exploitatie van schepen en luchtvaartuigen in het internationaal verkeer mede: 

a. voordelen behaald met de verhuur op basis van verhuur zonder bemanning van schepen en luchtvaartuigen mits deze in het internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd, en mits deze voordelen uit de verhuur een incidentele bron van inkomsten vormen naast de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid;  

b. voordelen verkregen uit het gebruik, het onderhoud of de verhuur van containers (daaronder begrepen opleggers of aanhangwagens, schuiten en daarmee verband houdende uitrusting voor het vervoer van containers) gebezigd voor het vervoer van goederen of koopwaar in het internationaal verkeer, mits deze voordelen een incidentele bron van inkomsten vormen naast de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid.     
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool", een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a. een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, of  

b. dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat en een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, en in het ene of het in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.     
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt – en dienovereenkomstig belast – ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstgenoemde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, past die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aan. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Partijen zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, 

a. heft de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is geen belasting over door dat lichaam betaalde dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een lichaam is, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld, en dat inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat en onmiddellijk ten minste 50 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt, in verband met investeringen – met inbegrip van uitbreiding van (bestaande) investeringen – gedaan na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag;  

b. heft de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is een belasting van ten hoogste 5 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een lichaam is, dat inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld en dat onmiddellijk minder dan 50 percent van het kapitaal bezit van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt.     
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede en derde lid.   
5.  De bepalingen van het tweede en derde lid laten onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
6.  De uitdrukking „dividenden", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten, niet zijnde schuldvorderingen, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst alsmede inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
7.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede, derde en negende lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing   
8.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   
9.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en achtste lid, mogen dividenden betaald door een lichaam met een in aandelen verdeeld kapitaal, dat volgens de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat inwoner is van die Staat, aan een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat ook in de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Staat worden belast overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat, indien die natuurlijke persoon aandelen bezit van het geplaatste kapitaal van een bepaalde soort aandelen in dat lichaam. Deze bepaling vindt alleen toepassing wanneer de natuurlijke persoon aan wie de dividenden worden betaald in de loop van de laatste tien jaar voorafgaande aan het jaar waarin die dividenden worden betaald inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest en mits op het tijdstip waarop hij inwoner werd van de andere Staat werd voldaan aan de eerdergenoemde voorwaarden ten aanzien van het aandelenbezit in eerdergenoemd lichaam. In de gevallen waarin, ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van de eerstbedoelde Staat, aan de natuurlijke persoon aan wie de dividenden worden betaald, een aanslag is opgelegd ter zake van de vorenbedoelde aandelen die geacht worden bij diens emigratie uit eerstbedoelde Staat te zijn vervreemd, geldt het vorenstaande alleen zolang er van deze aanslag nog een bedrag openstaat.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat die wordt verkregen door een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat die de uiteindelijke gerechtigde is, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, is interest afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat vrijgesteld van belasting in die Staat indien deze is betaald ter zake van een lening van welke soort dan ook 

a. verstrekt of gegarandeerd door de regering, een staatkundig onderdeel of plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam ervan of een agentschap van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat of de Centrale Bank van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

b. 

i. verstrekt door een bank,  

ii. verstrekt door een financiële instelling met een publiekrechtelijk karakter, mits in het geval van dit onderdeel de termijn voor aflossing van de lening ten minste drie jaar bedraagt.       
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede en derde lid.   
5.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen. In rekening gebrachte boetes voor te late betaling worden voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen die vaste inrichting behoort. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing   
7.  Interest wordt geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn indien zij wordt betaald door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd.   
8.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat die worden verkregen door een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat die de uiteindelijk gerechtigde is, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's een inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De uitdrukking „royalty's”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap, waaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing   
6.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn indien zij worden betaald door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  13  

####Vermogenswinsten

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat uit de vervreemding van onroerende zaken zoals bedoeld in artikel 6 en die zijn gelegen in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende goederen die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (afzonderlijk of met de gehele onderneming), mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen die in het internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende goederen die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen alsmede voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van containers (daaronder begrepen opleggers of aanhangwagens, schuiten en daarmee verband houdende uitrusting voor het vervoer van containers) gebezigd voor het vervoer van goederen of koopwaar in het internationaal verkeer waarop artikel 8, derde lid, onderdeel b van toepassing is, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen. Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een scheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats, voor de toepassing van dit lid, geacht te zijn gelegen in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere goederen dan die bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het vierde lid, mag een Verdragsluitende Staat overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving, de betekenis van de uitdrukking „vervreemding” daaronder begrepen, belasting heffen over voordelen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat verkregen uit de vervreemding van aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam met een in aandelen verdeeld kapitaal, dat volgens de wetgeving van de eerstbedoelde Verdragsluitende Staat inwoner is van die Staat, alsmede uit de vervreemding van een gedeelte van de in die aandelen of bewijzen besloten liggende rechten, indien die natuurlijke persoon aandelen bezit van het geplaatste kapitaal van een bepaalde soort aandelen van dat lichaam. Deze bepaling vindt alleen toepassing wanneer de natuurlijke persoon die de voordelen verkrijgt in de loop van de laatste tien jaar voorafgaande aan het jaar waarin die voordelen worden verkregen inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest en mits op het tijdstip waarop hij inwoner werd van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werd voldaan aan eerdergenoemde voorwaarden ten aanzien van het aandelenbezit in eerdergenoemd lichaam. In de gevallen waarin, ingevolge de nationale wetgeving van de eerstbedoelde Staat, aan de natuurlijke persoon een aanslag is opgelegd ter zake van de vorenbedoelde aandelen die geacht worden bij diens emigratie uit eerstbedoelde Staat te zijn vervreemd, geldt het vorenstaande alleen voor zover er van deze aanslag nog een bedrag openstaat.   

### Artikel  14  

####Beloningen uit dienstbetrekking

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van de artikelen 15, 17, 18, 19 en 20 zijn salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een dienstbetrekking slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de dienstbetrekking in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat wordt uitgeoefend. Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat te zake van een in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstgenoemde Staat belastbaar indien 

a. de genieter in de andere Staat verblijft gedurende een tijdvak dat of tijdvakken die in een tijdvak van twaalf maanden beginnend of eindigend in het desbetreffende belastingjaar een totaal van 183 dagen niet te boven gaat of gaan, en  

b. de beloning wordt betaald door of namens een werkgever die geen inwoner van de andere Staat is, en  

c. de beloning niet ten laste komt van een vaste inrichting die de werkgever in de andere Staat heeft.     
3.  Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van dit artikel mag de beloning verkregen ter zake van een dienstbetrekking uitgeoefend aan boord van een schip of luchtvaartuig dat in het internationaal verkeer wordt geëxploiteerd, worden belast in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   

### Artikel  15  

####Directeursbeloningen

Directeursbeloningen of andere beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat in zijn hoedanigheid van lid van de raad van beheer van een lichaam dat inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.  

### Artikel  16  

####Artiesten en sportbeoefenaars

1.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 7 en 14, mogen voordelen of inkomsten verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat als artiest, zoals een toneelspeler, een film-, radio- of televisie-artiest of een musicus, of als sportbeoefenaar, uit zijn persoonlijke werkzaamheden als zodanig die worden verricht in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, worden belast in die andere Staat.   
2.  Indien voordelen of inkomsten ter zake van persoonlijke werkzaamheden die door een artiest of een sportbeoefenaar in die hoedanigheid worden verricht, niet aan de artiest of sportbeoefenaar zelf toekomen, maar aan een andere persoon, mogen die voordelen of inkomsten, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 7 en 14, worden belast in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin de werkzaamheden van de artiest of sportbeoefenaar worden verricht.   
3.  Het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing op voordelen of inkomsten die worden verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat uit werkzaamheden die worden verricht in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, indien het bezoek aan die andere Staat geheel of grotendeels wordt bekostigd uit de openbare middelen van een of beide Verdragsluitende Staten, een staatkundig onderdeel, of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan, of plaatsvindt in het kader van een culturele overeenkomst tussen de Regeringen van de Verdragsluitende Staten. In een zodanig geval zijn de voordelen of inkomsten slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de artiest of sportbeoefenaar inwoner is.   

### Artikel  17  

####Pensioenen, lijfrenten en socialezekerheidsuitkeringen

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 18, tweede lid, zijn pensioenen en andere soortgelijke beloningen betaald aan een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking alsmede lijfrenten betaald aan een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat slechts in die Staat belastbaar. Pensioenen en andere uitkeringen betaald krachtens de bepalingen van een socialezekerheidsstelsel van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat zijn slechts in die andere Staat belastbaar.   
2.  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in het eerste lid, mag een pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning, een lijfrente of ieder pensioen en andere uitkering betaald krachtens de bepalingen van een socialezekerheidsstelsel van een Verdragsluitende Staat ook worden belast in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit deze afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat: 

a. indien en voor zover de aanspraak op dit pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente in de Verdragsluitende Staat, waaruit het pensioen of de andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente afkomstig is, van belasting is vrijgesteld, dan wel de met het pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente samenhangende bijdragen aan de pensioenregeling of verzekeringsmaatschappij, in het verleden bij het bepalen van het in die Staat belastbare inkomen in aftrek zijn gebracht, dan wel anderszins in die Staat in aanmerking zijn gekomen voor een fiscale tegemoetkoming; en  

b. indien en voor zover dit pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente in de Verdragsluitende Staat, waarvan de genieter inwoner is, niet tegen het algemeen van toepassing zijnde belastingtarief voor inkomsten verkregen uit dienstbetrekking, dan wel het brutobedrag van dat pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente voor minder dan 90 percent, in de belastingheffing wordt betrokken; en  

c. indien het totale bruto bedrag van de pensioenen en andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrenten en ieder pensioen of andere uitkering betaald krachtens de bepalingen van een socialezekerheidsstelsel van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in enig kalenderjaar een bedrag van 10.000 euro te boven gaat.     
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid, mag, indien dit pensioen of een andere soortgelijke beloning geen periodiek karakter draagt, wordt betaald ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat en uitbetaling plaatsvindt vóór de datum waarop het pensioen ingaat, of indien in plaats van het recht op lijfrente vóór de datum waarop de lijfrente ingaat een afkoopsom wordt betaald, de betaling of deze afkoopsom ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig is worden belast.   
4.  Een pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente wordt geacht afkomstig te zijn uit een Verdragsluitende Staat indien en voor zover de met dit pensioen of andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente samenhangende bedragen of betalingen, dan wel de aanspraken op dit pensioen of een andere soortgelijke beloning of lijfrente in die Staat in aanmerking zijn gekomen voor een fiscale faciliëring. De ingevolge dit artikel aan een Verdragsluitende Staat toegekende heffingsrechten worden op geen enkele wijze beperkt door de overdracht van een pensioen van een in een Verdragsluitende Staat gevestigd pensioenfonds of aldaar gevestigde verzekeringsmaatschappij naar een in een andere Staat gevestigd pensioenfonds of aldaar gevestigde verzekeringsmaatschappij.   
5.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid. Zij beslissen tevens welke gegevens de inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ten behoeve van een juiste toepassing van het Verdrag in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat moet overleggen, met name om te kunnen vaststellen of al dan niet voldaan is aan de voorwaarden als bedoeld in de onderdelen a, b en c van het tweede lid.   
6.  De uitdrukking „lijfrente” betekent een vaste som, periodiek betaalbaar op vaste tijdstippen, hetzij gedurende het leven, hetzij gedurende een vastgesteld of voor vaststelling vatbaar tijdvak, ingevolge een verbintenis tot het doen van betalingen, welke tegenover een voldoende en volledige tegenprestatie in geld of geldswaarde staat.   
7.  Of en in hoeverre een pensioen of soortgelijke beloning onder dit artikel of onder artikel 18 valt, wordt bepaald door het karakter van de vroegere dienstbetrekking, zijnde particulier of overheid, gedurende welke de aanspraak op dat gedeelte van het pensioen of soortgelijke beloning werd opgebouwd.   

### Artikel  18  

####Overheidsfuncties

1.  

a. Salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen, niet zijnde pensioenen, betaald door een Verdragsluitende Staat of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan aan een natuurlijke persoon ter zake van diensten verleend aan die Staat of dat onderdeel of dat publiekrechtelijke lichaam, mogen in die Staat worden belast.  

b. Deze salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen zijn echter slechts in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat belastbaar, indien de diensten in die Staat worden verleend en de natuurlijke persoon een inwoner is van die Staat die: 

i. onderdaan is van die Staat; of  

ii. niet uitsluitend voor het verrichten van de diensten inwoner van die Staat werd.

b. Deze pensioenen zijn echter slechts in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat belastbaar, indien de natuurlijke persoon inwoner en onderdaan is van die Staat.     
3.  De bepalingen van de artikelen 14, 15 en 17 zijn van toepassing op salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen en op pensioenen ter zake van diensten verleend in het kader van een op winst gericht bedrijf, uitgeoefend door een Verdragsluitende Staat of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan.   

### Artikel  19  

####Hoogleraren en docenten

1.  Vergoedingen die een hoogleraar of docent, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat en die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat verblijft met het doel gedurende een tijdvak van ten hoogste twee jaar onderwijs te geven of zich met wetenschappelijk onderzoek bezig te houden aan een universiteit, hogeschool of andere inrichting voor onderwijs of wetenschappelijk onderzoek in die andere Staat voor dat onderwijs of dat onderzoek ontvangt, zijn in die Staat niet belastbaar mits deze betalingen aan hem worden gedaan uit bronnen buiten die Staat.   
2.  Dit artikel is niet van toepassing op inkomsten uit het verrichten van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, indien dit onderzoek niet wordt verricht in het algemeen belang, maar in de eerste plaats voor het persoonlijk nut van een bepaalde persoon of bepaalde personen.   

### Artikel  20  

####Studenten

Vergoedingen die een student of een voor een beroep of bedrijf in opleiding zijnde persoon die inwoner is of onmiddellijk voorafgaande aan zijn bezoek aan een Verdragsluitende Staat inwoner was van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat en die uitsluitend voor zijn studie op opleiding in de eerstbedoelde Staat verblijft, ontvangt ten behoeve van zijn onderhoud, studie of opleiding, zijn in die Staat niet belastbaar, mits deze betalingen aan hem worden gedaan uit bronnen buiten die Staat.  

### Artikel  21  

####Overige inkomsten

1.  Bestanddelen van het inkomen van een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat, van waaruit ook afkomstig, die niet in de voorgaande artikelen van dit Verdrag zijn behandeld, zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing op inkomsten, niet zijnde inkomsten uit onroerende zaken zoals omschreven in artikel 6, tweede lid, indien de genieter van die inkomsten, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, en het recht of de zaak ter zake waarvan de inkomsten worden betaald tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In dat geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

### Artikel  22  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Uganda mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, zevende lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, eerste en derde lid, artikel 17, tweede lid, artikel 18, eerste lid (onderdeel a) en tweede lid (onderdeel a) en artikel 21, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Uganda mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze bestanddelen van het inkomen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden bedoelde bestanddelen van het inkomen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor de bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede en negende lid, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 13, vijfde lid, artikel 15, artikel 16 en artikel 17, derde lid, van dit Verdrag in Uganda mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Uganda over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt, indien de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting daarin voorzien, niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld. Dit lid zal een tegemoetkoming nu of in de toekomst verleend volgens de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting niet beperken, echter uitsluitend voor zover het de berekening van het bedrag van de vermindering van de Nederlandse belasting betreft met betrekking tot de som van inkomsten uit meer dan een land.   
4.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, verleent Nederland een aftrek op de Nederlandse belasting voor de in Uganda betaalde belasting op bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 7, artikel 10, zevende lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, en artikel 21, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Uganda mogen worden belast, voor zover deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, indien en voor zover Nederland uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting een aftrek verleent op de Nederlandse belasting voor de in een ander land over die bestanddelen van het inkomen geheven belasting. Voor de berekening van deze aftrek zijn de bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
5.  Dubbele belasting wordt in Uganda als volgt vermeden: Indien een inwoner van Uganda inkomen verkrijgt dat overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Nederland mag worden belast, verleent Uganda een aftrek van de belasting naar het inkomen van die inwoner gelijk aan het bedrag van de in Nederland betaalde belasting. Deze aftrek bedraagt echter niet meer dan het gedeelte van de belasting naar het inkomen, zoals berekend voordat de aftrek is verleend, dat is toe te rekenen aan het inkomen dat, naar gelang van het geval, in Nederland mag worden belast.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Bijzondere bepalingen

### Artikel  23  

####Werkzaamheden buitengaats

1.  De bepalingen van dit artikel vinden toepassing niettegenstaande andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag. Dit artikel is echter niet van toepassing indien werkzaamheden buitengaats van een persoon voor die persoon een vaste inrichting vormen ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 5.   
2.  In dit artikel betekent de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats” werkzaamheden die buitengaats worden verricht in verband met de exploratie of exploitatie van de in een Verdragsluitende Staat gelegen zeebodem en de ondergrond daarvan en hun natuurlijke rijkdommen.   
3.  Een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht, wordt, onder voorbehoud van het vierde lid van dit artikel, geacht ter zake van die werkzaamheden in de andere Staat een bedrijf uit te oefenen door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, tenzij de desbetreffende werkzaamheden buitengaats in de andere Staat worden verricht gedurende een tijdvak dat of tijdvakken die in een tijdvak van 12 maanden een totaal van 30 dagen niet te boven gaat of gaan. Voor de toepassing van dit lid: 

a. indien een onderneming die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht en die is gelieerd aan een andere onderneming, welke andere onderneming als onderdeel van hetzelfde project dezelfde werkzaamheden buitengaats voortzet die worden of werden uitgevoerd door de eerstbedoelde onderneming, en de hiervoor bedoelde door beide ondernemingen verrichte werkzaamheden bij elkaar opgeteld een tijdvak van 30 dagen te boven gaan, wordt iedere onderneming geacht haar werkzaamheden te verrichten gedurende een tijdvak dat 30 dagen in een tijdvak te boven gaat;  

b. wordt een onderneming geacht gelieerd te zijn aan een andere onderneming indien de een onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van de andere onderneming bezit of indien een persoon onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van beide ondernemingen bezit.     
4.  Voor de toepassing van het derde lid van dit artikel wordt de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats” evenwel niet geacht te omvatten: 

a. een van de activiteiten of een combinatie daarvan als genoemd in artikel 5, vierde lid;  

b. sleep- of ankerwerkzaamheden door schepen die in de eerste plaats voor dat doel zijn ontworpen alsmede andere door zulke schepen verrichte activiteiten;  

c. het vervoer van voorraden of personeel door schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer.     
5.  Salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een dienstbetrekking in verband met werkzaamheden buitengaats die worden verricht door middel van een vaste inrichting in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen, voorzover de dienstbetrekking in die andere Staat buitengaats wordt uitgeoefend, in die andere Staat worden belast.   
6.  Indien aan de hand van bewijsstukken wordt aangetoond dat in Uganda belasting is betaald over de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge artikel 7 en artikel 14 in verband met het derde lid van dit artikel en ingevolge het vijfde lid van dit artikel in Uganda mogen worden belast, verleent Nederland een vermindering van zijn belasting die wordt berekend overeenkomstig de regels die zijn neergelegd in artikel 22, tweede lid.   

### Artikel  24  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Staat worden in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende vereisten waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden, in het bijzonder met betrekking tot woonplaats, zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoner zijn van een of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. De belastingen op voordelen van vaste inrichtingen geheven op inkomen gerepatrieerd door een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, wordt niet aangemerkt als zijnde in strijd met de bepalingen van dit lid. De aldus geheven belasting mag echter niet meer bedragen dan 5 percent van het gerepatrieerde inkomen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerst lid, artikel 11, zevende lid, of artikel 12, zevende lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven betaald door een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  Bijdragen die door of namens een natuurlijke persoon, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, zijn betaald aan een voor de belastingheffing in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat erkende pensioenregeling, worden voor de belastingheffing in de eerstbedoelde Staat op dezelfde wijze behandeld als een bijdrage betaald aan een in die eerstbedoelde Staat voor de belastingheffing erkende pensioenregeling, mits: 

a. die natuurlijke persoon reeds bijdroeg aan de pensioenregeling voordat hij inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat werd; en  

b. de bevoegde autoriteit van de eerstbedoelde Staat van oordeel is dat de pensioenregeling overeenkomt met een door die Staat voor de belastingheffing erkende pensioenregeling. Voor de toepassing van dit lid omvat „pensioenregeling" mede een pensioenregeling die in het leven is geroepen uit hoofde van een publiek socialezekerheidsstelsel.     
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn van toepassing op de belastingen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is.   

### Artikel  25  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 24, eerste lid, aan die van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat te regelen teneinde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met het Verdrag te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen teneinde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen die niet in het Verdrag zijn geregeld.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen teneinde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   
5.  Wanneer moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die zijn gerezen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of toepassing van het Verdrag niet binnen een periode van twee jaar nadat de vraag is gerezen opgelost kunnen worden door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten in een procedure voor onderling overleg ingevolge de voorgaande leden van dit artikel, kan het geval op verzoek van een van de Verdragsluitende Staten, worden voorgelegd voor arbitrage, echter slechts nadat de procedures die beschikbaar zijn op grond van het eerste tot en met het vierde lid van dit artikel volledig zijn uitgeput en mits de betrokken belastingplichtige of belastingplichtigen er schriftelijk mee instemmen te zijn gebonden door de beslissing van de arbitragecommissie. De beslissing van de arbitragecommissie in een bepaald geval is voor dat geval bindend voor beide Verdragsluitende Staten en de betrokken belastingplichtige of belastingplichtigen.   

### Artikel  26  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten wisselen de inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor het uitvoeren van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten met betrekking tot belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is, voorzover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met het Verdrag. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een Verdragsluitende Staat ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (daaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op belastingen. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. Zij mogen de inlichtingen bekendmaken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen aan de arbitragecommissie, ingesteld volgens de bepalingen van artikel 25, vijfde lid, de inlichtingen verstrekken die nodig zijn om de arbitrageprocedure uit te voeren. Deze inlichtingen worden verstrekt met inachtneming van de bepalingen van artikel 28.  De leden van de arbitragecommissie zijn met betrekking tot de aldus verkregen inlichtingen onderworpen aan de beperkingen van openbaarmaking als omschreven in het eerste lid van dit artikel.  

### Artikel  27  

####Bijstand bij invordering

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten komen overeen elkaar hulp en bijstand te verlenen, in overeenstemming met hun onderscheiden wetgeving of administratieve praktijk, bij de invordering van de belastingen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is en op de genoemde belastingen betrekking hebbende administratieve boetes, interest en kosten.   
2.  Op verzoek van de verzoekende Verdragsluitende Staat vordert de aangezochte Verdragsluitende Staat belastingvorderingen van de eerstgenoemde Staat in overeenkomstig de wetgeving en administratieve praktijk met betrekking tot de invordering van zijn eigen belastingvorderingen. Deze vorderingen genieten echter geen voorrang in de aangezochte Staat en kunnen niet worden ingevorderd door middel van in hechtenis nemen wegens schuld van de schuldenaar. De aangezochte Staat is niet verplicht invorderingsmaatregelen te nemen waarin de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat niet voorziet.   
3.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid zijn slechts van toepassing op belastingvorderingen die onderwerp zijn van een executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat en die, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten, niet worden bestreden. Indien de vordering echter een belastingverplichting betreft van een persoon die geen inwoner van de verzoekende Staat is, is het tweede lid slechts van toepassing indien de vordering niet langer kan worden bestreden, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten.   
4.  De aangezochte Staat is niet verplicht het verzoek in te willigen: 

a. indien de verzoekende Staat niet alle op zijn eigen grondgebied beschikbare middelen heeft aangewend, tenzij aanwending van die middelen zou leiden tot onevenredige moeilijkheden;  

b. indien en voor zover hij de belastingvordering in strijd acht met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of met enig ander verdrag waarbij beide Staten partij zijn.     
5.  De executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat wordt, indien passend en in overeenstemming met de in de aangezochte Staat van kracht zijnde bepalingen, zo spoedig mogelijk na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek om bijstand aanvaard, erkend of aangevuld dan wel vervangen door een executoriale titel in de aangezochte Staat.   
6.  Op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat neemt de aangezochte Staat met het oog op de invordering van een belastingbedrag conservatoire maatregelen, zelfs indien de vordering wordt bestreden of nog niet invorderbaar is, voor zover dit is toegestaan volgens de wetgeving en de administratieve praktijk van de aangezochte Staat.   
7.  Vragen betreffende het tijdvak waarbuiten niet langer kan worden ingevorderd worden beheerst door de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat. Het verzoek om bijstand bij invordering geeft bijzonderheden aangaande dat tijdvak.   
8.  Invorderingsdaden, verricht door de aangezochte Staat ingevolge een verzoek om bijstand die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat een schorsing of onderbreking van het in het zevende lid bedoelde tijdvak tot gevolg zouden hebben, worden geacht hetzelfde gevolg te hebben voor de toepassing van de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat. De aangezochte Staat doet de verzoekende Staat mededeling van dergelijke daden.   
9.  De aangezochte Staat kan uitstel van betaling of betaling in termijnen toestaan indien zijn wetgeving of zijn administratieve praktijk dit toestaat in soortgelijke omstandigheden; hij doet echter eerst de verzoekende Staat hiervan mededeling.   
10.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten stellen in onderlinge overeenstemming regels vast betreffende het minimumbedrag van belastingvorderingen waarop een verzoek om bijstand betrekking kan hebben.   
11.  De Verdragsluitende Staat waarin belasting is ingevorderd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel maakt het aldus ingevorderde bedrag, na aftrek, indien van toepassing, van het bedrag van de buitengewone kosten bedoeld in het twaalfde lid, onderdeel b, onverwijld over aan de Verdragsluitende Staat ten behoeve waarvan de belasting werd geïnd.   
12.  Het is wel te verstaan dat, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten van beide Verdragsluitende Staten, 

a. gewone kosten ontstaan voor een Verdragsluitende Staat bij het verlenen van bijstand door die Staat worden gedragen,  

b. buitengewone kosten ontstaan voor een Verdragsluitende Staat bij het verlenen van bijstand door de andere Staat worden gedragen en worden vergoed ongeacht het namens hem door de eerstbedoelde Staat geïnde bedrag. Zodra een Verdragsluitende Staat voorziet dat mogelijk buitengewone kosten zullen ontstaan, stelt hij de andere Verdragsluitende Staat daarvan in kennis onder vermelding van het geraamde bedrag van die kosten.     
13.  De verzoekende Staat zal in ieder geval verantwoordelijk blijven jegens de aangezochte Staat voor de geldelijke gevolgen van de invorderingsdaden die onterecht zijn gebleken ten aanzien van de realiteit van de betrokken belastingvordering of van de rechtsgeldigheid van de executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat.   
14.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten stellen in onderlinge overeenstemming gezamenlijk regels vast betreffende de toepassing van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  28  

####Beperkingen van de artikelen 26 en 27

In geen geval worden de bepalingen van de artikelen 26 en 27 zo uitgelegd dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichting opleggen: 

a. administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

b. inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn volgens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

c. inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfsnijverheids- of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, dan wel inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde (ordre public).    

### Artikel  29  

####Leden van diplomatieke vertegenwoordigingen en consulaire posten

1.  De bepalingen in dit Verdrag tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die leden van diplomatieke vertegenwoordigingen of consulaire posten ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van het Verdrag wordt een natuurlijke persoon die deel uitmaakt van een diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging of consulaire post van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat of in een derde Staat en die een onderdaan is van de zendstaat, geacht inwoner van de zendstaat te zijn, indien hij daarin aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen is onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   
3.  Het Verdrag is niet van toepassing op internationale organisaties, op hun organen of functionarissen, noch op leden van een diplomatieke vertegenwoordiging of consulaire post van een derde Staat, die in een Verdragsluitende Staat verblijven, indien zij in die Staat niet aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen zijn onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   

### Artikel  30  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Dit Verdrag kan, hetzij in zijn geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba, of tot de Nederlandse Antillen of Aruba afzonderlijk, indien het desbetreffende land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Een dergelijke uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, daaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van het Verdrag niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van het Verdrag tot enig land waartoe het ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Slotbepalingen

### Artikel  31  

####Inwerkingtreding

1.  Dit Verdrag treedt in werking dertig dagen na de laatste der data waarop de onderscheiden Regeringen elkaar schriftelijk hebben medegedeeld, dat de in hun onderscheiden Staten grondwettelijk vereiste formaliteiten zijn vervuld.   
2.  Dit Verdrag vindt toepassing: 

a. met betrekking tot aan de bron geheven belastingen, voor bedragen die betaald of verrekend zijn op of na de eerste dag van de tweede maand die volgt op die waarin het Verdrag in werking treedt;  

b. met betrekking tot andere belastingen, 

i. wat betreft Nederland, voor belastingjaren en -tijdvakken die aanvangen op of na de eerste dag van januari van het kalenderjaar volgend op het jaar dat volgt op de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag;  

ii. wat betreft Uganda, voor inkomensjaren die aanvangen op of na de eerste dag van juli van het kalenderjaar dat volgt op de inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag.       

### Artikel  32  

####Beëindiging

1.  Dit Verdrag blijft van kracht totdat het door een van de Verdragsluitende Staten wordt beëindigd. Elk van de Staten kan het Verdrag langs diplomatieke weg beëindigen door ten minste zes maanden voor het einde van enig kalenderjaar na het verstrijken van een periode van vijf jaar na de datum van inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag kennis te geven van de beëindiging.   
2.  In dat geval houdt het Verdrag op van toepassing te zijn:

####Protocol

Bij de ondertekening van het Verdrag tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting en het voorkomen van het ontgaan van belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen heden gesloten tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Uganda, zijn de ondergetekenden overeengekomen dat de volgende bepalingen een integrerend deel van het Verdrag vormen.    

### I  

####Ad artikel 3, eerste lid, onderdeel e

Ingeval een eenheid die voor de belastingheffing als een rechtspersoon wordt behandeld als zodanig in een Verdragsluitende Staat aan belasting is onderworpen, maar het inkomen van dat lichaam in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat als inkomen van de participanten van die eenheid wordt belast, nemen de bevoegde autoriteiten dusdanige maatregelen dat er enerzijds geen dubbele belasting blijft bestaan, maar anderzijds wordt voorkomen dat louter als gevolg van de toepassing van het Verdrag inkomen (gedeeltelijk) niet aan belastingheffing wordt onderworpen. Om te bepalen of dit het geval is, wordt de belasting geheven over het inkomen van die eenheid geacht belasting te zijn, geheven over het inkomen van de participanten van die eenheid, naar rato van hun gerechtigdheid in het vermogen van die eenheid. Voor zover nodig kan bovendien worden bepaald dat iedere participant, naar rato van zijn gerechtigdheid in die eenheid, de belasting geheven op het niveau van de eenheid mag verrekenen (inclusief eventuele daarop drukkende bronbelasting van derde Staten), met de belasting die hij verschuldigd is over hetzelfde inkomen. Voorts mag de Staat van vestiging van de eenheid afzien van eventuele belastingheffing over uitdeling van winst van die eenheid aan de participanten.  

### II  

####Ad artikel 4

Een natuurlijke persoon die aan boord van een schip woont zonder een werkelijke woonplaats in een van de Verdragsluitende Staten te hebben, wordt geacht inwoner te zijn van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin het schip zijn thuishaven heeft.  

### III  

####Ad artikel 4

Het is wel te verstaan dat inwoners die gedurende korte tijd wonen in een Verdragsluitende Staat en wier wereldwijd vergaarde inkomen in die Staat niet aan belastingheffing wordt onderworpen, voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag niet worden beschouwd als inwoner.  

### IV  

####Ad artikelen 5 en 7

Het is wel te verstaan dat geen voordelen worden toegerekend aan een vaste inrichting op grond van het gebruik maken van inrichtingen louter voor de aflevering van goederen of koopwaar die aan de onderneming toebehoort.  

### V  

####Ad artikelen 5, 6, 7, 13 en 23

Het is wel te verstaan dat rechten tot exploitatie en exploratie van natuurlijke rijkdommen worden beschouwd als onroerende zaken die zijn gelegen in de Verdragsluitende Staat op wiens zeebodem en ondergrond daarvan deze rechten betrekking hebben, alsmede dat deze rechten geacht worden te behoren tot de activa van een vaste inrichting in die Staat. Voorts is het wel te verstaan dat de hiervoor genoemde rechten ook omvatten rechten op belangen bij, of de voordelen uit vermogensbestanddelen die voortvloeien uit die exploratie of exploitatie.  

### VI  

####Ad artikel 7

Met betrekking tot artikel 7, eerste en tweede lid, geldt dat, indien een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat goederen of koopwaar verkoopt of een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde inrichting, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet worden bepaald op basis van het totale door de onderneming ontvangen bedrag, doch slechts op basis van dat deel van de inkomsten van de onderneming dat aan de werkelijke werkzaamheden van de vaste inrichting voor die verkopen of die bedrijfsuitoefening is toe te rekenen. Met name bij overeenkomsten betreffende het toezicht op, de levering, installatie of constructie van nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting of gebouwen alsmede bij openbare werken, worden, indien de onderneming een vaste inrichting heeft, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet bepaald op basis van het totale bedrag van de overeenkomst, doch slechts op basis van dat deel van de overeenkomst dat werkelijk wordt uitgevoerd door de vaste inrichting in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd. De voordelen die betrekking hebben op het deel van de overeenkomst, dat wordt uitgevoerd door het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de onderneming inwoner is.  

### VII  

####Ad artikel 7

Vergoedingen voor technische diensten, waaronder begrepen studies of onderzoeken van wetenschappelijke, geologische of technische aard, of voor diensten van adviserende of toezichthoudende aard, worden aan-gemerkt als vergoedingen waarop de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing zijn.  

### VIII  

####Ad artikel 9

Het is wel te verstaan dat de omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten, zoals „costsharing"-overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in artikel 9, eerste lid. Dit belet een Verdragsluitende Staat evenwel niet voornoemde overeenkomsten te controleren op voorwaarden als bedoeld in artikel 9, eerste lid.  

### IX  

####Ad artikel 10

De bepalingen van artikel 10, derde lid, onderdeel a, zijn van toepassing zolang ingevolge de bepalingen van de Nederlandse Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting, van een lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland geen Nederlandse vennootschapsbelasting wordt geheven ter zake van dividenden die dat lichaam ontvangt van een lichaam dat inwoner is van Uganda. Wanneer voor en na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag investeringen zijn gedaan in een Verdragsluitende Staat is het wel te verstaan dat dividenden voor de toepassing van artikel 10, derde lid, onderdeel a, worden aangemerkt als verkregen uit die investeringen naar rato van de verhouding tussen die onderscheiden investeringen. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 10, tweede lid, heft de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam inwoner is geen belasting over door dat lichaam betaalde dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een pensioenfonds is als bedoeld artikel 4, tweede lid.  

### X  

####Ad artikelen 10 en 11

Niettegenstaande artikel 10, zesde lid, is het wel te verstaan dat de uitdrukking „dividenden” mede omvat inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen, mits de wetgeving van een Verdragsluitende Staat deze inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen op dezelfde wijze aan belastingheffing onderwerpt als inkomsten uit aandelen aan de hand van een combinatie van de volgende criteria: 

- de datum van aflossing van de lening;  

- de hoogte van de vergoeding of de verschuldigdheid van de vergoeding hangt af van de winst of de uitdelingen van de winst; en  

- de rangorde van een lening    

### XI  

####Ad artikelen 5 en 7, 10, 11 en 12

Indien aan de bron belasting is geheven die het belastingbedrag dat ingevolge de bepalingen van de artikelen 5 en 7, 10, 11 of 12 mag worden geheven te boven gaat, moeten verzoeken om teruggaaf van het daarboven uitgaande belastingbedrag worden ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven, binnen een tijdvak van drie jaar na afloop van het kalenderjaar waarin de belasting is geheven. De teruggave geschiedt binnen een termijn van zes maanden na [de datum] waarop het verzoek bij de bevoegde autoriteit werd ingediend. De termijn van zes maanden kan worden verlengd indien beide Verdragsluitende Staten overeenkomen dat de benodigde documentatie niet is overgelegd aan de bevoegde autoriteit van eerstgenoemde Staat.  

### XII  

####Ad artikelen 10 en 13

Het is wel te verstaan dat inkomsten die worden ontvangen in verband met de (gedeeltelijke) liquidatie van een lichaam of een inkoop van eigen aandelen door een lichaam worden behandeld als inkomsten uit aandelen en niet als vermogenswinsten.  

### XIII  

####Ad artikelen 10 en 13

Het is wel te verstaan dat in het geval van Nederland, artikel 13, vijfde lid, alleen van toepassing is in het geval van een natuurlijke persoon die, al dan niet tezamen met zijn echtgenoot of een van zijn bloed- of aanverwanten in de rechte lijn, onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minstevijf percent bezit van het geplaatste kapitaal van een bepaalde soort aandelen van een lichaam. Het is voorts wel te verstaan dat indien een dergelijke natuurlijke persoon een schuldvordering heeft op dat lichaam, de bepalingen van artikel 13, vijfde lid, eveneens van toepassing zijn met betrekking tot door die natuurlijke persoon verkregen vermogenswinsten uit de „vervreemding" van een dergelijke schuldvordering.  

### XIV  

####Ad artikel 11

Het is wel te verstaan dat indien een persoon als bedoeld in artikel 11, derde lid, onderdeel a, een lening verstrekt via een andere persoon, de lening wordt geacht te zijn verstrekt door de eerstbedoelde persoon. Als persoon bedoeld in artikel 11, derde lid, onderdeel a, worden tevens aangemerkt de Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikke-lingslanden NV (FMO) en de Nederlandse Investeringsbank voor Ontwikkelingslanden VN (NIO).  

### XV  

####Ad artikel 15

Het is wel te verstaan dat een „bestuurder” of „commissaris” van een Nederlands lichaam wordt aangemerkt als een lid van de raad van beheer als bedoeld in artikel 15. Het is voorts wel te verstaan dat „bestuurder” of „commissaris” van een Nederlands lichaam betrekking heeft op personen die als zodanig zijn benoemd door de algemene vergadering van aandeelhouders of door enig ander bevoegd orgaan van dat lichaam, en die zijn belast met de algemene leiding van het lichaam, onderscheidenlijk met het toezicht daarop. In het geval van Uganda wordt een „managing director” of een „executive director” van een Oegandees lichaam aangemerkt als een lid van de raad van beheer als bedoeld in artikel 15.  

### XVI  

####Ad artikel 24

1.  Het is wel te verstaan dat Nederland en Uganda op het tijdstip van ondertekening van dit Verdrag, onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 24, zesde lid, inwoners van beide Verdragsluitende Staten ten aanzien van belastingen van elke soort en benaming in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit artikel behandelen. Indien een Verdragsluitende Partij met betrekking tot belastingen van elke soort en benaming inwoners op enig tijdstip na de ondertekening van dit Verdrag evenwel behandelt op een wijze die niet in overeenstemming is met de in artikel 24 vervatte beginselen, regelen de bevoegde autoriteiten in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze waarop deze behandeling ongedaan gemaakt kan worden.   
2.  Indien en zo lang een verdrag tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting tussen Uganda en een lid van de OESO van kracht is, dat niet voorziet in een additionele belasting als bedoeld in de tweede zin van artikel 24, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag, wordt de daarin genoemde additionele belasting niet geheven van ondernemingen van Nederland.   

### XVII  

####Ad artikel 25

De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen, zonodig in strijd met hun respectieve nationale wetgeving, ter zake van een overeengekomen regeling in het kader van een procedure voor onderling overleg als bedoeld in artikel 25, tevens overeenkomen dat de Staat waar ingevolge eerdergenoemde regeling sprake is van een additionele belastingheffing, met betrekking tot deze additionele belastingheffing afziet van belastingverhogingen, boetes, interest en kosten, indien de andere Staat, waarin ingevolge de regeling sprake is van een overeenkomstige vermindering van belasting, afziet van de betaling van interest verschuldigd met betrekking tot een dergelijke vermindering van belasting.
