The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6  

####Income from immovable property

1.  Income derived by a resident of one of the States from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other State may be taxed in that other State.

### Article  7  

####Business Profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in one of the States to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####Shipping and Air Transport

1.  Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.   
2.  If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
3.  With respect to profits derived by the air transport consortium Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) the provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply only to such part of the profits as corresponds to the participation held in that consortium by Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (DDL), the Danish partner of Scandinavian Airlines System. The participation in the enterprise of SAS by DDL shall for the purpose of paragraph 1 be considered to constitute an enterprise operating aircraft in international traffic having its place of effective management in Denmark.   
4.  For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the operation in international traffic of ships and aircraft include profits derived from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships and aircraft if operated in international traffic if such rental profits are incidental to the profits described in paragraph 1.   
5.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated Enterprises

1.  Where 

a) an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. It is understood, however, that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as costsharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in the preceding sentence.     
2.  Where one of the States includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 the State of which the company is a resident shall not levy a tax on dividends paid by that company, if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company which is a resident of the other State and holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.   
5.  The term “dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance" shares or “jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
6.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
7.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   

### Article  11

3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
4.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
5.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
4.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
5.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income or capital which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Denmark.   
2.  However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income or owns items of capital which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 6 of Article 10, paragraph 3 of Article 11, paragraph 3 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraph 1 of Article 15, paragraph 3 of Article 18, paragraphs 1 (sub-paragraph a) and 2 (sub-paragraph a) of Article 19, paragraph 2 of Article 21 and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 22 of this Convention may be taxed in Denmark and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income or capital by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income or capital shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income or capital which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 13, Article 16, Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18 of this Convention may be taxed in Denmark to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Denmark on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.   
4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax for the tax paid in Denmark on items of income which according to Article 7, paragraph 6 of Article 10, paragraph 3 of Article 11, paragraph 3 of Article 12 and paragraph 2 of Article 21 of this Convention may be taxed in Denmark to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, if and insofar as the Netherlands under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation allows a deduction from the Netherlands tax of the tax levied in another country on such items of income. For the computation of this deduction the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply accordingly.   
5.  

a) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph c), where a resident of Denmark derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Netherlands, Denmark shall allow: 

(i) as a deduction from the taxes on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the taxes on income paid in the Netherlands;  

(ii) as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident, an amount equal to the tax on capital paid in the Netherlands.    

b) Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of income tax or capital tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or the capital which may be taxed in the Netherlands.  

c) Where a resident of Denmark derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be taxable only in the Netherlands or may be taxed in the Netherlands in accordance with the provisions of article 15 and article 19, Denmark may include this income or capital in the tax base, but shall allow as a deduction from the income tax or capital tax that part of the income tax or capital tax, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income derived from or the capital owned in the Netherlands.  

d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph a) and b) of this paragraph, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a company which is a resident of Denmark shall be exempt from Danish tax according to the provisions of Danish law governing the exemption of tax on dividends paid to Danish companies by subsidiaries abroad. However, in the case where dividends do not qualify for the exemption from Danish tax, Denmark shall – in addition to the deduction from tax as mentioned in sub-paragraph a) and b) – allow as a deduction from the tax on such dividends the tax payable in respect of the profits out of which such dividends are paid in conformity with article 4 of the EC council directive of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States as it may be amended.  

e) In the case of an individual who was a resident of Denmark for a period of five years or more and has become resident of the Netherlands and under the national law of Denmark has been taxed in respect of capital gains on shares, up to the change of residence, then Denmark shall allow where the shares are subsequently alienated and the gains from such alienation are taxed in the Netherlands as a deduction from the tax on the income an amount equal to the income tax which is paid in the Netherlands with respect to the income which was taxed in Denmark. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed the income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is levied on the said income in Denmark.  

f) For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraphs 3a) and 4 of Article 2, other than the capital tax, shall be considered taxes on income.     

### CHAPTER  VI  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  24  

####Offshore activities

1.  In case of activities covered by this Article, its provisions shall apply notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention. However, this Article shall not apply where offshore activities of a person constitute for that person a permanent establishment under the provisions of Article 5 or a fixed base under the provisions of Article 14.   
2.  In this Article the term “offshore activities" means activities which are carried on offshore in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea bed and its subsoil and their natural resources, situated in one of the States.   
3.  An enterprise of one of the States which carries on offshore activities in the other State shall, subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, be deemed to be carrying on, in respect of those activities, business in that other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, unless the offshore activities in question are carried on in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 30 days in any period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph: 

a) where an enterprise carrying on offshore activities in the other State is associated with another enterprise and that other enterprise continues, as part of the same project, the same offshore activities that are or were being carried on by the first-mentioned enterprise, and the afore-mentioned activities carried on by both enterprises - when added together - exceed a period of 30 days, then each enterprise shall be deemed to be carrying on its activities for a period exceeding 30 days in a 12 months-period;  

b) an enterprise shall be regarded as associated with another enterprise if one holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of the other enterprise or if a person holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of both enterprises.     
4.  However, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article the term “offshore activities" shall be deemed not to include one or any combination of the activities mentioned in paragraph 4 of Article 5.   
5.  Profits derived by a resident of one of the States from the transportation of supplies or personnel to a location, or between locations, where activities in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources are being carried on in one of the States, or from the operation of tugboats and other vessels auxiliary to such activities, shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.   
6.  A resident of one of the States who carries on offshore activities in the other State, which consist of professional services or other activities of an independent character, shall be deemed to be performing those activities from a fixed base in the other State if the offshore activities in question last for a continuous period of 30 days or more.   
7.  Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of one of the States in respect of an employment connected with offshore activities carried on through a permanent establishment in the other State may, to the extent that the employment is exercised offshore in that other State, be taxed in that other State.   
8.  Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of one of the States in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft covered by paragraph 5 shall be taxed in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 15.   
9.  Where documentary evidence is produced that tax has been paid in Denmark on the items of income which may be taxed in Denmark according to Article 7 and Article 14 in connection with respectively paragraph 3 and paragraph 6 of this Article, and to paragraph 7 of this Article, the Netherlands shall allow a reduction of its tax which shall be computed in conformity with the rules laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 23.   

### Article  25  

####Non-discrimination

1.  Nationals of one of the States shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging one of the States to grant to residents of the other State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 5 of Article 11, or paragraph 5 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  Contributions borne by an individual who renders dependent personal services in one of the States to a pension scheme established in and recognised for tax purposes in the other State shall, during a period not exceeding in the aggregate 60 months, be deducted, in the first-mentioned State in determining the individual's taxable income, and treated in that State, in the same way and subject to the same conditions and limitations as contributions made to a pension scheme that is recognised for tax purposes in that first-mentioned State, provided that: 

a) the individual was not a resident of that State, and was contributing to the pension scheme, immediately before he began to exercise employment in that State; and  

b) the individual is either still employed by the same employer as immediately before he began to exercise employment in that State, or by an employer which is an associated enterprise of the aforementioned employer, and  

c) the pension scheme is accepted by the competent authority of that State as generally corresponding to a pension scheme recognised as such for tax purposes by that State. Payments to the pension scheme by the enterprise paying his remuneration shall not be deemed to be taxable income of the individual.     
6.  For the purposes of paragraph 5: 

a) the term “a pension scheme" means a compulsory arrangement in which the individual participates in order to secure retirement benefits payable in respect of the dependent personal services referred to in paragraph 5; and  

b) a pension scheme is recognised for tax purposes in a State if the contributions to the scheme would qualify for tax relief in that State.   The competent authorities may consult each other in case a pension scheme is not a compulsory arrangement with a view to decide whether it is justified to apply the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 5 in such case.   
7.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  26  

####Mutual agreement procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 25, to that of the State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   

### Article  27  

####Exchange of information

The competent authorities of the States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by one of the States shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.  

### Article  28  

####Assistance in recovery

1.  The States agree to lend each other assistance and support with a view to the collection, in accordance with their respective laws or administrative practice, of the taxes to which this Convention shall apply and of any increases, surcharges, overdue payments, interests and costs pertaining to the said taxes.   
2.  At the request of the applicant State the requested State shall recover tax claims of the first-mentioned State in accordance with the law and administrative practice for the recovery of its own tax claims. However, such claims do not enjoy any priority in the requested State and cannot be recovered by imprisonment for debt of the debtor. The requested State is not obliged to take any executory measures which are not provided for in the laws of the applicant State.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply only to tax claims which form the subject of an instrument permitting their enforcement in the applicant State and, unless otherwise agreed between the competent authorities, which are not contested. However, where the claim relates to a liability to tax of a person as a non resident of the applicant State, paragraph 2 shall only apply, unless otherwise agreed between the competent authorities, where the claim may no longer be contested.   
4.  The obligation to provide assistance in the recovery of tax claims concerning a deceased person or his estate is limited to the value of the estate or the property acquired by each beneficiary of the estate, according to whether the claim is to be recovered from the estate or from the beneficiaries thereof.   
5.  The requested State shall not be obliged to accede to the request: 

a) if the applicant State has not pursued all means available in its own territory, except where recourse to such means would give rise to disproportionate difficulty;  

b) if and insofar as it considers the tax claim to be contrary to the provisions of this Convention or of any other convention to which both of the States are parties.     
6.  The request for administrative assistance in the recovery of a tax claim shall be accompanied by: 

a) a declaration that the tax claim concerns a tax covered by the Convention and that the conditions of paragraph 3 are met;  

b) an official copy of the instrument permitting enforcement in the applicant State;  

c) any other document required for recovery;  

d) where appropriate, a certified copy confirming any related decision emanating from an administrative body or a public court.     
7.  The applicant State shall indicate the amounts of the tax claim to be recovered in both the currency of the applicant State and the currency of the requested State. The rate of exchange to be used for the purpose of the preceding sentence is the last selling price settled on the most representative exchange market or markets of the applicant State. Each amount recovered by the requested State shall be transferred to the applicant State in the currency of the requested State. The transfer shall be carried out within a period of a month from the date of the recovery.   
8.  At the request of the applicant State, the requested State shall, with a view to the recovery of an amount of tax, take measures of conservancy even if the claim is contested or is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement, in so far as such is permitted by the laws and administrative practice of the requested State.   
9.  The instrument permitting enforcement in the applicant State shall, where appropriate and in accordance with the provisions in force in the requested State, be accepted, recognised, supplemented or replaced as soon as possible after the date of the receipt of the request for assistance by an instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State.   
10.  Questions concerning any period beyond which a tax claim cannot be enforced shall be governed by the law of the applicant State. The request for assistance in the recovery shall give particulars concerning that period. However, the requested State shall not comply with a request for administrative assistance which is submitted after the period beyond which the tax claim cannot be enforced under the law of that State.   
11.  Acts of recovery carried out by the requested State in pursuance of a request for assistance, which, according to the laws of that State, would have the effect of suspending or interrupting the period mentioned in paragraph 10, shall also have this effect under the laws of the applicant State. The requested State shall inform the applicant State about such acts and when necessary consult each other.   
12.  The requested State may allow deferral of payment or payment by instalments, if its laws or administrative practice permit it to do so in similar circumstances; but it shall first inform the applicant State.   
13.  The competent authorities of the States shall by common agreement prescribe rules concerning minimum amounts of tax claims subject to a request for assistance.   
14.  The States shall reciprocally waive any restitution of costs resulting from the respective assistance and support which they lend each other in applying this Convention. However, this will not include costs of court proceedings and of advice from experts. The applicant State shall in any event remain responsible towards the requested State for the pecuniary consequences of acts of recovery which have been found unjustified in respect of the reality of the tax claim concerned or of the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement in the applicant State.   

### Article  29  

####Limitation of Articles 27 and 28

In no case shall the provisions of Articles 27 and 28 of this Convention be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).    

### Article  30  

####Miscellaneous rules

1.  The competent authorities of the States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of Articles 10, 11 and 12.   
2.  The competent authorities of each of the States, in accordance with the practices of that State, may prescribe regulations necessary to carry out other provisions of this Convention.   
3.  It is understood that: 

a) where under the provisions of this Convention a resident of the Netherlands is exempt or entitled to relief from Danish tax, similar exemption or relief shall be applied to the undivided estate of a deceased person insofar as one or more of the beneficiaries are residents of the Netherlands;  

b) for the purposes of Article 23, the Danish tax on the undivided estate of a deceased person shall, insofar as the income or capital accrues to a beneficiary who is a resident of the Netherlands, be regarded as tax on the income or capital of such beneficiary.     

### Article  31  

####Diplomatic agents and consular officers

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.   
2.  For the purposes of this Convention an individual, who is a member of a diplomatic or consular mission of one of the States in the other State or in a third State and who is a national of the sending State, shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending State if he is submitted therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income and on capital as are residents of that State.   
3.  The Convention shall not apply to international organisations, organs and officials thereof and members of a diplomatic or consular mission of a third State, being present in one of the States, if they are not subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income or on capital as are residents of that State.   

### Article  32  

####Territorial extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to either or both of the countries of the Netherlands Antilles or Aruba, or to the Faroe Islands and Greenland, if the country or territory concerned imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to any country or territory to which it has been extended under this Article.

2.  It is understood that the terminology “the tax payable in respect of the profits out of which such dividends are paid", as mentioned in paragraph 5 sub-paragraph d) of Article 23, shall include any tax directly or indirectly suffered by the company paying the dividends on the profits or income out of which the dividends are paid.

6.  Een onderneming wordt niet geacht een vaste inrichting in een van de Staten te bezitten alleen op grond van de omstandigheid dat zij in die Staat zaken doet door bemiddeling van een makelaar, commissionair of enige andere onafhankelijke vertegenwoordiger, mits deze personen in de normale uitoefening van hun bedrijf handelen.

De omstandigheid dat een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, een lichaam beheerst of door een lichaam wordt beheerst dat inwoner is van de andere Staat of dat in die andere Staat zaken doet (hetzij door middel van een vaste inrichting, hetzij op andere wijze), stempelt een van beide lichamen niet tot een vaste inrichting van het andere.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####BELASTINGHEFFING NAAR HET INKOMEN

### Artikel  6  

####Inkomsten uit onroerende zaken

1.  Inkomsten verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit onroerende zaken (waaronder begrepen voordelen uit landbouw- of bosbedrijven) die in de andere Staat zijn gelegen mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  De uitdrukking „onroerende zaken" heeft de betekenis welke die uitdrukking heeft volgens de wetgeving van de Staat waarin de desbetreffende zaken zijn gelegen. De uitdrukking omvat in ieder geval de zaken die bij de onroerende zaken behoren, levende en dode have van landbouw- en bosbedrijven, rechten waarop de bepalingen van het privaatrecht betreffende de grondeigendom van toepassing zijn, vruchtgebruik van onroerende zaken en rechten op veranderlijke of vaste vergoedingen ter zake van de exploitatie, of concessie tot exploitatie, van minerale aardlagen, bronnen en andere natuurlijke rijkdommen; schepen en luchtvaartuigen worden niet als onroerende zaken beschouwd.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn van toepassing op inkomsten verkregen uit de rechtstreekse exploitatie, uit het verhuren of verpachten, of uit elke andere vorm van exploitatie van onroerende zaken.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en derde lid zijn ook van toepassing op inkomsten uit onroerende zaken van een onderneming en op inkomsten uit onroerende zaken die worden gebruikt voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid.   

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten – waaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten – die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voor zover het in een van de Staten gebruikelijk is de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet niets in het tweede lid die Staat de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van de aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van dit Verdrag worden behandeld, laten de bepalingen van dit artikel de bepalingen van die artikelen onverlet.   

### Artikel  8  

####Zee- en luchtvaart

1.  Voordelen uit de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
2.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een zeescheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Staat waarin de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
3.  Ten aanzien van voordelen verkregen door het luchtvaartconsortium Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) zijn de bepalingen van het eerste lid slechts van toepassing op dat deel van de voordelen dat overeenkomt met de deelneming in dat consortium van Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (DDL), de Deense deelgenoot in Scandinavian Airlines System. Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid wordt de deelneming door de DDL in de onderneming van het SAS aangemerkt als een onderneming die luchtvaartuigen exploiteert in internationaal verkeer met haar plaats van werkelijke leiding in Denemarken.   
4.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvatten voordelen verkregen uit de exploitatie in internationaal verkeer van schepen en luchtvaartuigen mede voordelen behaald met de verhuur op basis van verhuur zonder bemanning van schepen en luchtvaartuigen indien zij worden geëxploiteerd in het internationale verkeer, indien deze voordelen voortvloeien uit de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool", een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a. een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b. dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat,   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast. Het is echter wel verstaan, dat de omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten, zoals „cost-sharing"-overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in de voorgaande zin.   
2.  Indien een van de Staten in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt – en dienovereenkomstig belast – ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen die de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van dit verdrag en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid mag de Staat waarvan het lichaam inwoner is geen belasting heffen op door dat lichaam betaalde dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een lichaam is dat inwoner is van de andere Staat en onmiddellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt.   
4.  De bepalingen van de tweede en derde lid laten onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winsten waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
5.  De uitdrukking „dividenden", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten, niet zijnde schuldvorderingen, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
7.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat is slechts in die andere Staat belastbaar indien die inwoner de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest is.   
2.  De uitdrukking „interest", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen. In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
4.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de schuldenaar van de interest, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de lening ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en de interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
5.  Indien, om reden van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat zijn slechts in die andere Staat belastbaar indien die inwoner de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot die royalty's is.   
2.  De uitdrukking „royalty's", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap, waaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms en beeld- of geluidsbanden voor televisie- of radiouitzendingen, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of 14 van toepassing.   
4.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
5.  Indien, om reden van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  13  

####Vermogenswinsten

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit de vervreemding van onroerende zaken, zoals bedoeld in artikel 6 en die zijn gelegen in de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende goederen die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, of van roerende goederen die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende goederen die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen. De bepalingen van artikel 8, tweede lid, vinden hierbij toepassing. Ten aanzien van voordelen verkregen door het luchtvaartconsortium Scandinavian Airlines System, zijn de bepalingen van dit lid slechts van toepassing op dat deel van de voordelen dat overeenkomt met de deelneming in dat consortium van Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (DDL), de Deense deelgenoot in Scandinavian Airlines System. Voor de toepassing van dit lid wordt de deelneming door de DDL in de onderneming van het SAS aangemerkt als een onderneming die luchtvaartuigen exploiteert in internationaal verkeer met haar plaats van werkelijke leiding in Denemarken.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere goederen dan die bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  De bepalingen van het vierde lid laten onverlet het recht van Nederland overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving belasting te heffen over voordelen die uit de vervreemding van aandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld en dat volgens de Nederlandse wetgeving inwoner is van Nederland, worden verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van Denemarken en die in de loop van de laatste vijf jaren voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de aandelen of winstbewijzen inwoner van Nederland is geweest.   

### Artikel  14  

####Zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van een van de Staten in de uitoefening van een vrij beroep of ter zake van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij hij in de andere Staat voor het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden geregeld over een vast middelpunt beschikt. Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep" omvat in het bijzonder zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.   

### Artikel  15  

####Niet-zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van de artikelen 16, 18 en 19 zijn salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een dienstbetrekking slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de dienstbetrekking in de andere Staat wordt uitgeoefend. Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een in de andere Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstbedoelde Staat belastbaar, indien: 

a. de genieter in de andere Staat verblijft gedurende een tijdvak of tijdvakken, die in een tijdvak van 12 maanden een totaal van 183 dagen niet te boven gaan, en  

b. de beloning wordt betaald door of namens een werkgever die geen inwoner van de andere Staat is, en  

c. de beloning niet ten laste komt van een vaste inrichting die, of van een vast middelpunt dat de werkgever in de ander Staat heeft.     
3.  Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van dit artikel is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een dienstbetrekking uitgeoefend aan boord van een schip of luchtvaartuig dat in internationaal verkeer wordt geëxploiteerd, slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   

### Artikel  16  

####Directeursbeloningen

Directeursbeloningen of andere beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten in zijn hoedanigheid van lid van de raad van beheer, van bestuurder of van commissaris van een lichaam dat inwoner is van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.  

### Artikel  17  

####Artiesten en sportbeoefenaars

1.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 14 en 15 mogen voordelen of inkomsten, verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten als artiest, zoals een toneelspeler, een film-, radio- of televisie-artiest of een musicus, of als sportbeoefenaar, uit zijn persoonlijke werkzaamheden als zodanig die worden verricht in de andere Staat, worden belast in die andere Staat.   
2.  Indien voordelen of inkomsten ter zake van persoonlijke werkzaamheden die door een artiest of een sportbeoefenaar in die hoedanigheid worden verricht, niet aan de artiest of sportbeoefenaar zelf toekomen, maar aan een andere persoon, mogen die voordelen of inkomsten, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 7, 14 en 15, worden belast in de Staat waarin de werkzaamheden van de artiest of sportbeoefenaar worden verricht.   

### Artikel  18  

####Pensioenen, lijfrenten en sociale-zekerheidsuitkeringen

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van artikel 19, tweede lid, zijn pensioenen en andere soortgelijke beloningen betaald aan een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking alsmede lijfrenten slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   
2.  Indien deze beloningen echter geen periodiek karakter dragen en worden betaald ter zake van een in de andere Staat uitgeoefende vroegere dienstbetrekking, of indien in plaats van het recht op lijfrenten een afkoopsom wordt betaald, mogen deze beloningen of deze afkoopsom worden belast in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn.   
3.  Pensioenen en andere betalingen krachtens de bepalingen van een sociale-zekerheidsstelsel van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in de eerstbedoelde Staat worden belast.   
4.  De uitdrukking „lijfrente" betekent een vaste som, periodiek betaalbaar op vaste tijdstippen, hetzij gedurende het leven, hetzij gedurende een vastgesteld of voor vaststelling vatbaar tijdvak, ingevolge een verbintenis tot het doen van betalingen, welke tegenover een voldoende en volledige tegenprestatie in geld of geldswaarde staat.   

### Artikel  19  

####Overheidsfuncties

1.  

a. Beloningen, niet zijnde pensioenen, betaald door een van de Staten of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan aan een natuurlijke persoon ter zake van diensten bewezen aan die Staat of dat onderdeel of dat publiekrechtelijk lichaam, mogen in die Staat worden belast.  

b. Deze beloningen zijn echter slechts in de andere Staat belastbaar, indien de diensten in die Staat worden bewezen en de natuurlijke persoon inwoner is van die Staat, die: 

1. onderdaan is van die Staat; of  

2. niet uitsluitend voor het verrichten van de diensten inwoner van die Staat werd.       
2.  

a. Pensioenen, betaald door, of uit fondsen in het leven geroepen door, een van de Staten of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan aan een natuurlijke persoon ter zake van diensten bewezen aan die Staat of dat onderdeel of dat publiekrechtelijk lichaam, mogen in die Staat worden belast.  

b. Deze pensioenen zijn echter slechts in de andere Staat belastbaar, indien de natuurlijke persoon inwoner en onderdaan is van die Staat.     
3.  De bepalingen van de artikelen 15, 16 en 18 zijn van toepassing op beloningen en pensioenen ter zake van diensten bewezen in het kader van een op winst gericht bedrijf uitgeoefend door een van de Staten of een staatkundig onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan.   

### Artikel  20  

####Studenten

Betalingen die een student of een voor een beroep of bedrijf in opleiding zijnde persoon, die inwoner is of onmiddellijk voor zijn bezoek aan een van de Staten inwoner was van de andere Staat en die uitsluitend voor zijn studie of opleiding in de eerstbedoelde Staat verblijft, ontvangt ten behoeve van zijn onderhoud, studie of opleiding, zijn in die Staat niet belastbaar, mits deze betalingen aan hem worden gedaan uit bronnen buiten die Staat.  

### Artikel  21  

####Overige inkomsten

1.  Bestanddelen van het inkomen van een inwoner van een van de Staten, van waaruit ook afkomstig, die niet in de voorgaande artikelen van dit Verdrag zijn behandeld, zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   
2.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing op inkomsten, niet zijnde inkomsten uit onroerende zaken zoals omschreven in artikel 6, tweede lid, indien de genieter van die inkomsten, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak ter zake waarvan de inkomsten worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####BELASTINGHEFFING NAAR HET VERMOGEN

### Artikel  22  

####Vermogen

1.  Vermogen bestaande uit onroerende zaken, zoals bedoeld in artikel 6, dat een inwoner van een van de Staten bezit en dat is gelegen in de andere Staat, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Vermogen bestaande uit roerende goederen die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, of uit roerende goederen die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Vermogen bestaande uit schepen en luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd alsmede uit roerende goederen die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen en luchtvaartuigen, is slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen. Het bepaalde in artikel 8, tweede lid, vindt hierbij toepassing. Ten aanzien van vermogen dat in bezit is van het luchtvaartconsortium Scandinavian Airlines Systems, zijn de bepalingen van dit lid slechts van toepassing op dat deel van het vermogen dat overeenkomt met de deelneming in dat consortium van Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (DDL), de Deense deelgenoot in Scandinavian Airlines System. Voor de toepassing van dit lid wordt de deelneming door de DDL in de onderneming van het SAS aangemerkt als een onderneming die luchtvaartuigen exploiteert in internationaal verkeer met haar plaats van werkelijke leiding in Denemarken.   
4.  Alle andere bestanddelen van het vermogen van een inwoner van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  23  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Denemarken mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt of vermogen bezit die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, zesde lid, artikel 11, derde lid, artikel 12, derde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste lid, artikel 18, derde lid, artikel 19, eerste lid, letter a, en tweede lid, letter a, artikel 21, tweede lid, en artikel 22, eerste en tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Denemarken mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden bedoelde bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 13, vijfde lid, artikel 16, artikel 17 en artikel 18, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Denemarken mogen worden belast, voor zover deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Denemarken over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die volgens de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
4.  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in het tweede lid zal Nederland een aftrek op de Nederlandse belasting verlenen voor de in Denemarken betaalde belasting op die bestanddelen van het inkomen welke volgens artikel 7, artikel 10, zesde lid, artikel 11, derde lid, artikel 12, derde lid, en artikel 21, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Denemarken mogen worden belast, voor zover die bestanddelen van het inkomen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, indien en voor zover Nederland op grond van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting ter zake van die bestanddelen van het inkomen een aftrek verleent op de Nederlandse belasting van de in een ander land over die bestanddelen van het inkomen geheven belasting. Voor de berekening van deze aftrek is het bepaalde in het derde lid van dit artikel van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
5.  

a. Onverminderd de bepalingen van letter c) staat Denemarken, indien een inwoner van Denemarken inkomsten verkrijgt of vermogen bezit dat in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Nederland mag worden belast: 

i. een aftrek toe op de belasting naar het inkomen van die inwoner, tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Nederland betaalde belasting op het inkomen;  

ii. een aftrek toe op de belasting naar het vermogen van die inwoner, tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Nederland betaalde belasting op het vermogen.    

b. Deze aftrek overschrijdt echter in geen van beide gevallen dat deel van de inkomstenbelasting of vermogensbelasting, zoals deze is berekend vóór het verlenen van de vermindering, dat, al naar gelang van het geval, kan worden toegerekend aan het inkomen of het vermogen dat in Nederland mag worden belast.  

c. Indien een inwoner van Denemarken inkomsten verkrijgt of vermogensbestanddelen bezit die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag uitsluitend in Nederland mogen worden belast of in Nederland mogen worden belast overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 15 en artikel 19, mag Denemarken deze inkomsten of vermogensbestanddelen in de belastinggrondslag begrijpen maar zal het in aftrek toestaan op de inkomstenbelasting of vermogensbelasting dat deel van de inkomstenbelasting of vermogensbelasting dat toerekenbaar is, al naar gelang van het geval, aan de inkomsten verkregen uit of de vermogensbestanddelen bezeten in Nederland.  

d. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van letter a en letter b van dit lid, zullen dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland aan een lichaam dat inwoner is van Denemarken, volgens de bepalingen van de Deense wetgeving die betrekking hebben op de vrijstelling van belasting op dividenden die door buitenlandse dochtervennootschappen aan Deense lichamen worden betaald, worden vrijgesteld van Deense belasting. Indien dividenden evenwel niet in aanmerking komen voor de vrijstelling van Deense belasting, zal Denemarken – naast de aftrek van belasting zoals bedoeld in letter a en b – op de belasting over deze dividenden in aftrek toestaan de verschuldigde belasting over de winst van waaruit deze dividenden zijn betaald overeenkomstig artikel 4 van de richtlijn van de Raad van de EG van 23 juli 1990 betreffende de gemeenschappelijke fiscale regeling voor moedermaatschappijen en dochterondernemingen uit verschillende Lid-Staten, zoals deze kan worden gewijzigd.  

e. In het geval een natuurlijke persoon gedurende een periode van vijf jaar of meer inwoner van Denemarken was en inwoner van Nederland is geworden en op grond van de nationale wetgeving van Denemarken belast is geweest ter zake van vermogenswinsten op aandelen tot aan het moment van de wijziging van zijn woonplaats, verleent Denemarken, indien de aandelen vervolgens worden vervreemd en de winsten van deze vervreemding in Nederland worden belast, een aftrek van de belasting over het inkomen tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de inkomstenbelasting die in Nederland wordt betaald met betrekking tot het inkomen dat in Denemarken was belast. Deze aftrek zal echter niet de inkomstenbelasting zoals deze berekend is vóór het verlenen van de vermindering, die over het bedoelde inkomen in Denemarken is geheven, overschrijden.  

f. Voor de toepassing van dit lid worden de belastingen waarnaar de leden 3a en 4 van artikel 2 verwijzen, met uitzondering van de vermogensbelasting, aangemerkt als belastingen naar het inkomen.     

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  24  

####Werkzaamheden buitengaats

1.  Ingeval werkzaamheden door dit artikel worden bestreken, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel toepassing, niettegenstaande enigerlei andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag. Dit artikel vindt echter geen toepassing indien werkzaamheden buitengaats van een persoon voor die persoon een vaste inrichting vormen ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 5 of een vast middelpunt ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 14.   
2.  In dit artikel betekent de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats" werkzaamheden die buitengaats worden verricht in verband met de exploratie of exploitatie van de in een van de Staten gelegen zeebodem en de ondergrond daarvan en hun natuurlijke rijkdommen.   
3.  Een onderneming van een van de Staten die in de andere Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht, wordt onverminderd het vierde lid van dit artikel geacht ter zake van die werkzaamheden in die andere Staat een bedrijf uit te oefenen door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, tenzij de desbetreffende werkzaamheden buitengaats in de andere Staat worden verricht gedurende een tijdvak of tijdvakken die in een tijdvak van twaalf maanden een totaal van 30 dagen niet te boven gaan. Voor de toepassing van dit lid wordt: 

a. indien een onderneming die in de andere Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht en die is gelieerd aan een andere onderneming, welke andere onderneming als onderdeel van hetzelfde project dezelfde werkzaamheden buitengaats voortzet die worden of werden uitgevoerd door de eerstbedoelde onderneming, en de hiervoor bedoelde door beide ondernemingen verrichte activiteiten bij elkaar opgeteld een tijdvak van 30 dagen te boven gaan, iedere onderneming geacht zijn werkzaamheden uit te oefenen gedurende een tijdvak dat 30 dagen in een tijdvak van 12 maanden te boven gaat;  

b. een onderneming geacht gelieerd te zijn aan een andere onderneming indien de een onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van de andere onderneming bezit of indien een persoon onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van beide ondernemingen bezit.     
4.  Voor de toepassing van het derde lid van dit artikel wordt de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats" evenwel geacht niet te omvatten een van de activiteiten of een combinatie daarvan als bedoeld in het vierde lid van artikel 5.   
5.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit het vervoer van voorraden of personeel naar een plaats, of tussen plaatsen, in een van de Staten waar werkzaamheden worden verricht in verband met de exploratie of exploitatie van de zeebodem en de ondergrond daarvan en hun natuurlijke rijkdommen, of uit de exploitatie van sleepboten en andere schepen die bij zulke werkzaamheden behulpzaam zijn, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
6.  Een inwoner van een van de Staten die in het kader van een vrij beroep of van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard in de andere Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht, wordt geacht deze werkzaamheden te verrichten vanuit een vast middelpunt in de andere Staat indien de desbetreffende werkzaamheden buitengaats een aaneengesloten periode van 30 dagen of meer beslaan.   
7.  Salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een dienstbetrekking in verband met werkzaamheden buitengaats die worden verricht door middel van een vaste inrichting in de andere Staat, mogen, voor zover de dienstbetrekking in de andere Staat buitengaats wordt uitgeoefend, in die andere Staat worden belast.   
8.  Salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van een van de Staten ter zake van een dienstbetrekking uitgeoefend aan boord van een schip of luchtvaartuig zoals bestreken door het vijfde lid worden belast in overeenstemming met artikel 15, derde lid.   
9.  Indien aan de hand van bewijsstukken wordt aangetoond dat in Denemarken belasting is betaald over de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge artikel 7 en artikel 14 in verband met het derde onderscheidenlijk het zesde lid van dit artikel en het zevende lid van dit artikel in Denemarken mogen worden belast, verleent Nederland een vermindering op zijn belasting, die wordt berekend overeenkomstig de regels die zijn neergelegd in het tweede lid van artikel 23.   

### Artikel  25  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoners zijn van een of van beide Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet zo worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, vijfde lid, of artikel 12, vijfde lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat. Zo ook zijn alle schulden van een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat bij de vaststelling van het belastbare vermogen van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij waren aangegaan met een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  Bijdragen die worden gedragen door een natuurlijke persoon die niet-zelfstandige arbeid verricht in een van de Staten aan een in de andere Staat ingestelde en aldaar voor de belastingheffing erkende pensioenregeling, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat, gedurende een tijdvak dat een totaal van 60 maanden niet te boven gaat, bij de bepaling van het belastbare inkomen van de natuurlijke persoon afgetrokken en behandeld in die Staat op dezelfde wijze en onderworpen aan dezelfde voorwaarden en beperkingen als bijdragen betaald aan een pensioenregeling die voor de belastingheffing in die eerstbedoelde Staat is erkend, mits: 

a. die natuurlijke persoon geen inwoner van die Staat was en reeds bijdroeg aan de pensioenregeling onmiddellijk voordat hij de dienstbetrekking in die Staat begon uit te oefenen; en  

b. de natuurlijke persoon hetzij nog in dienstbetrekking is bij dezelfde werkgever als op het tijdstip onmiddellijk voorafgaand aan het moment waarop hij zijn dienstbetrekking begon uit te oefenen in die Staat, hetzij bij een werkgever die een gelieerde onderneming is van de hiervoor genoemde werkgever; en  

c. de pensioenregeling naar het oordeel van de bevoegde autoriteit van die Staat in het algemeen overeenkomt met een door die Staat voor belastingdoeleinden erkende pensioenregeling. Als belastbaar inkomen van een natuurlijke persoon worden niet beschouwd betalingen aan de pensioenregeling gedaan door de onderneming die zijn beloning betaalt.     
6.  Voor de toepassing van het vijfde lid: 

a. betekent de uitdrukking „een pensioenregeling" een verplichte regeling waaraan een natuurlijke persoon deelneemt ten einde pensioenuitkeringen ter zake van de niet-zelfstandige arbeid als bedoeld in lid 5 veilig te stellen; en  

b. wordt een pensioenregeling voor belastingdoeleinden in een Staat erkend indien de bijdragen aan de regeling in die Staat voor belastingvermindering in aanmerking zouden komen.   Ingeval een pensioenregeling geen verplichte regeling is, kunnen de bevoegde autoriteiten met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde te beslissen of het gerechtvaardigd is om in dat geval de bepalingen van dit lid en het vijfde lid toe te passen.   
7.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  26  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 25, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met het Verdrag, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarin het Verdrag niet voorziet.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  27  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen de inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van de nationale wetgeving van de Staten betreffende de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is, voor zover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met het Verdrag. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een Staat ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (daaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken met betrekking tot de belastingen waarop het verdrag van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. Zij mogen de inlichtingen bekendmaken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.  

### Artikel  28  

####Bijstand bij invordering

1.  De Staten nemen op zich elkaar hulp en bijstand te verlenen, in overeenstemming met hun onderscheiden wetgeving of administratieve praktijk, bij de invordering van de belastingen waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is en de op genoemde belastingen betrekking hebbende verhogingen, boetes, betalingen wegens termijnoverschrijdingen, interest en kosten.   
2.  Op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat vordert de aangezochte Staat belastingvorderingen van de eerstgenoemde Staat in overeenkomstig de wetgeving en de administratieve praktijk met betrekking tot de invordering van zijn eigen belastingvorderingen. Deze vorderingen genieten echter geen voorrang in de aangezochte Staat en kunnen niet worden ingevorderd door middel van het in hechtenis nemen wegens schuld van de schuldenaar. De aangezochte Staat is niet verplicht invorderingsmaatregelen te nemen waarin de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat niet voorziet.   
3.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid zijn slechts van toepassing op belastingvorderingen die onderwerp zijn van een executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat en die, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten, niet worden bestreden. Indien de vordering echter een belastingverplichting betreft van een persoon die geen inwoner van de verzoekende Staat is, is het tweede lid slechts van toepassing indien de vordering niet langer kan worden bestreden, tenzij anders overeengekomen tussen de bevoegde autoriteiten.   
4.  De verplichting om bijstand te verlenen bij het invorderen van belastingvorderingen betreffende een overledene of zijn nalatenschap is beperkt tot de waarde van de nalatenschap of van de goederen verkregen door iedere begunstigde van de nalatenschap, afhankelijk van de vraag of de belastingvordering dient te worden ingevorderd uit de nalatenschap of bij de begunstigden daarvan.   
5.  De aangezochte Staat is niet verplicht het verzoek in te willigen: 

a. indien de verzoekende Staat niet alle op zijn eigen grondgebied beschikbare middelen heeft aangewend, tenzij aanwending van die middelen zou leiden tot onevenredige moeilijkheden;  

b. indien en voor zover hij de belastingvordering in strijd acht met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of met enige ander verdrag waarbij beide Staten partij zijn.     
6.  Het verzoek om administratieve bijstand bij invordering van een belastingvordering gaat vergezeld van: 

a. een verklaring dat de belastingvordering een belasting betreft waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is en dat aan de voorwaarden van het derde lid is voldaan;  

b. een officieel afschrift van de executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat;  

c. ieder ander document dat vereist is voor invordering;  

d. indien van toepassing, een gewaarmerkt afschrift van een op de belastingvordering betrekking hebbende beslissing genomen door een administratief lichaam of een openbare rechterlijke instantie.     
7.  De verzoekende Staat vermeldt de bedragen van de verschuldigde belasting die moet worden ingevorderd, zowel in de munteenheid van de verzoekende Staat als in de munteenheid van de aangezochte Staat. De wisselkoers die met het oog op de voorafgaande zin moet worden gebruikt, is de laatste verkoopprijs vastgesteld op de meest representatieve wisselmarkt of markten van de verzoekende Staat. Ieder bedrag dat door de aangezochte Staat wordt ingevorderd, wordt naar de verzoekende Staat overgemaakt in de munteenheid van de aangezochte Staat. De overmaking geschiedt binnen een termijn van een maand na de datum van de invordering.   
8.  Op verzoek van de verzoekende Staat neemt de aangezochte Staat met het oog op de invordering van een belastingbedrag conservatoire maatregelen, zelfs indien de vordering wordt bestreden of nog niet invorderbaar is, voor zover dit is toegestaan volgens de wetgeving en de administratieve praktijk van de aangezochte Staat.   
9.  De executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat wordt, indien passend en in overeenstemming met de in de aangezochte Staat van kracht zijnde bepalingen, zo spoedig mogelijk na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek om bijstand aanvaard, erkend of aangevuld, dan wel vervangen door een executoriale titel in de aangezochte Staat.   
10.  Vragen betreffende het tijdvak waarbuiten niet langer kan worden ingevorderd worden beheerst door de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat. Het verzoek om bijstand bij invordering geeft bijzonderheden aangaande dat tijdvak. De aangezochte Staat behoeft echter niet te voldoen aan een verzoek om administratieve bijstand dat wordt ingediend na het verstrijken van de periode waarna invordering van de belastingvordering niet meer mogelijk is ingevolge de wetgeving van die Staat.   
11.  Invorderingsdaden, verricht door de aangezochte Staat ingevolge een verzoek om bijstand die overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat een schorsing of onderbreking van het in het tiende lid bedoelde tijdvak tot gevolg zouden hebben, worden geacht hetzelfde gevolg te hebben voor de toepassing van de wetgeving van de verzoekende Staat. De aangezochte Staat doet de verzoekende Staat mededeling van zodanige daden en zij plegen, indien noodzakelijk, met elkaar overleg.   
12.  De aangezochte Staat kan uitstel van betaling of betaling in termijnen toestaan indien zijn wetgeving of zijn administratieve praktijk dit toestaat in soortgelijke omstandigheden; hij doet echter eerst de verzoekende Staat hiervan mededeling.   
13.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten stellen in onderlinge overeenstemming regels vast betreffende het minimumbedrag van belastingvorderingen waarop een verzoek om bijstand betrekking kan hebben.   
14.  De Staten zien wederzijds af van de terugbetaling van kosten die voortvloeien uit de onderscheiden hulp en bijstand die zij elkaar verlenen bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag. Hierin zijn echter niet begrepen de kosten van gerechtelijke procedures en advies van deskundigen. De verzoekende Staat zal in ieder geval verantwoordelijk blijven jegens de aangezochte Staat voor de geldelijke gevolgen van de invorderingsdaden die onterecht zijn gebleken ten aanzien van de realiteit van de betrokken belastingvordering of van de rechtsgeldigheid van de executoriale titel in de verzoekende Staat.   

### Artikel  29  

####Beperking van de artikelen 27 en 28

In geen geval worden de bepalingen van de artikelen 27 en 28 van dit Verdrag zo uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a. administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving en de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b. inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn krachtens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of de andere Staat;  

c. inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, commercieel of beroepsgeheim of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen of inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.    

### Artikel  30  

####Diverse bepalingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van de artikelen 10, 11 en 12 regelen.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van elk van de Staten kunnen, in overeenstemming met het gebruik van die Staat, uitvoeringsvoorschriften vaststellen die nodig zijn om de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag uit te voeren.   
3.  Het is wel verstaan, dat: 

a. indien een inwoner van Nederland volgens de bepalingen van dit Verdrag is vrijgesteld van of recht heeft op vermindering van Deense belasting, een soortgelijke vrijstelling of vermindering van toepassing is op de onverdeelde boedel van een overledene, voor zover een of meer van de verkrijgers een inwoner van Nederland is;  

b. voor de toepassing van artikel 23, Deense belasting op de onverdeelde boedel van een overledene, voor zover de inkomsten of het vermogen opkomen aan een verkrijger die inwoner van Nederland is, wordt beschouwd als belasting op inkomsten of op vermogen van zulk een verkrijger.     

### Artikel  31  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

1.  De bepalingen van dit Verdrag tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaren ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van het Verdrag wordt een natuurlijke persoon die lid is van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een van de Staten in de andere Staat of in een derde Staat en die onderdaan is van de zendstaat, geacht inwoner van de zendstaat te zijn, indien hij daarin aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen en naar het vermogen is onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   
3.  Het Verdrag is niet van toepassing op internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, noch op leden van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat die in een van de Staten verblijven, indien zij in die Staat niet aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen of naar het vermogen zijn onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   

### Artikel  32  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Dit Verdrag kan, hetzij in zijn geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot de Nederlandse Antillen of Aruba, of tot de Faeröereilanden en Groenland, indien het betrokken land of gebied belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van het verdrag niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van het Verdrag tot enig land of gebied waartoe het ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.

### III  

####Ad artikelen 5, 6, 13 en 22

Het is wel verstaan dat rechten tot exploratie en exploitatie van de zeebodem en de ondergrond daarvan en hun natuurlijke rijkdommen worden beschouwd als een onroerende zaak die is gelegen in de Staat op wiens zeebodem en ondergrond daarvan deze rechten betrekking hebben, alsmede dat deze rechten worden geacht te behoren tot de activa van een vaste inrichting in die Staat. Voorts is het wel te verstaan dat vorenbedoelde rechten ook omvatten rechten op belangen bij, of voordelen uit, vermogensbestanddelen die voortvloeien uit die exploratie of exploitatie.  

### IV  

####Ad artikel 7

Met betrekking tot het eerste en het tweede lid van artikel 7 geldt dat, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat goederen of koopwaar verkoopt of een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet worden bepaald op basis van het totale door de onderneming ontvangen bedrag, doch slechts op basis van de vergoedingen die aan de werkelijke werkzaamheden van de vaste inrichting voor die verkopen of die bedrijfsuitoefening zijn toe te rekenen. Met name bij contracten betreffende het toezicht op, de levering, installatie of constructie van nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting of gebouwen alsmede bij openbare werken, worden, indien de onderneming een vaste inrichting heeft, de voordelen van die vaste inrichting niet bepaald op basis van het totale bedrag van het contract, maar slechts op basis van dat deel van het contract dat werkelijk wordt uitgevoerd door de vaste inrichting in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd. De voordelen die betrekking hebben op dat deel van het contract dat wordt uitgevoerd door het hoofdkantoor van de onderneming, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de onderneming inwoner is.  

### V  

####Ad artikel 8

Het is wel verstaan dat de bepalingen van artikel 8, vierde lid, worden opgevat overeenkomstig de paragrafen 9 en 10 van het Commentaar bij artikel 8 van het OESO-modelverdrag ter zake van dubbele belasting van inkomen en vermogen 1977.

Het is wel verstaan dat, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 11, ingeval een van de Staten de inkomsten van winstdelende obligaties aan een heffing op dividenden onderwerpt artikel 10 van toepassing is op zulke inkomsten opkomende in die Staat.  

### VII  

####Ad artikel 10, 11 en 12

Indien aan de bron een belasting is geheven die het belastingbedrag dat ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 10, 11 of 12 mag worden geheven te boven gaat, moeten verzoeken om teruggaaf van het daarboven uitgaande belastingbedrag worden ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven, binnen een tijdvak van drie jaar na afloop van het kalenderjaar waarin de belasting is geheven.  

### VIII  

####Ad artikel 13

Ingeval de Deense wetgeving zodanig wordt gewijzigd dat Denemarken een heffingsrecht kan uitoefenen zoals neergelegd in artikel 13, vijfde lid, dan kunnen op verzoek van Denemarken de bepalingen van artikel 13, vijfde lid, worden gewijzigd en vervangen door de volgende tekst: „5. De bepalingen van het vierde lid laten onverlet het recht van elk van de Staten overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving een belasting te heffen over voordelen die uit de vervreemding van aandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld en dat krachtens de wetten van die Staat inwoner is van die Staat, worden verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Staat en die in de loop van de laatste vijf jaren voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de aandelen of winstbewijzen inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest." Het verzoek tot deze wijziging zal door middel van kennisgeving langs diplomatieke weg aan Nederland worden gedaan. De wijziging zal in werking treden op de dertigste dag na de datum waarop Nederland deze kennisgeving heeft ontvangen en haar bepalingen zullen van toepassing zijn op belastingen op vermogenswinsten verkregen op of na 1 januari van het kalenderjaar onmiddellijk volgend op het jaar waarin de wijziging in werking is getreden.  

### IX

### X  

####Ad artikel 18

Het is wel verstaan dat Nederland en Denemarken in overleg zullen treden teneinde te overwegen of een aanpassing van artikel 18 noodzakelijk is in het licht van ontwikkelingen in de EG of de OESO met betrekking tot de vraag of het nog steeds passend is vast te houden aan het exclusieve heffingsrecht van de woonstaat ter zake van pensioenen en andere soortgelijke beloningen betaald aan een inwoner van een van de Staten ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking alsmede lijfrenten als bedoeld in artikel 18, eerste lid.  

### XI  

####Ad artikel 23

(1).  Het is wel verstaan dat voor de berekening van de in het tweede lid van artikel 23 bedoelde vermindering de waarde van de in het eerste lid van artikel 22 bedoelde vermogensbestanddelen wordt verminderd met de waarde van de schulden verzekerd door hypotheek op dat vermogen en de waarde van de in het tweede lid van artikel 22 bedoelde vermogensbestanddelen wordt verminderd met de waarde van de tot de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt behorende schulden.

Het is wel verstaan dat de uitdrukking „de verschuldigde belasting over de winst van waaruit deze dividenden zijn betaald" in artikel 23, vijfde lid, letter d, elke belasting omvat die bij het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt direct of indirect drukt op de winst of het inkomen van waaruit de dividenden zijn betaald.   

### XII  

####Ad artikel 24
