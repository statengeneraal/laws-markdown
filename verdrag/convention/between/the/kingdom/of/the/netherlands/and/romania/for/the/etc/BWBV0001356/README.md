### Article  5  

####Permanent establishment

1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

d) a factory;  

e) a workshop, and  

f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.     
3.  A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than 12 months.

a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

h) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to g), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.     
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.   
6.  An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.   
7.  The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6  

####Income from immovable property

1.  Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  The term “immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats, aircraft and railway vehicles shall not be regarded as immovable property.   
3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.   

### Article  7  

####Business profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####International traffic

1.  Profits from the operation of ships, aircraft or railway vehicles in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.   
2.  If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.   
3.  For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the operation in international traffic of ships, aircraft and railway vehicles include profits derived from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships, aircraft and railway vehicles if operated in international traffic if such rental profits are incidental to the profits described in paragraph 1.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated enterprises

1.  Where 

a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,   and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. It is understood, however, that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as costsharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in the preceding sentence.   
2.  Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: 

a) 0 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

b) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

c) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.   This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.   
4.  The term “dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance" shares or “jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   
7.  The provisions of sub-paragraphs a) and b) of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the relation between the two companies has been arranged or is maintained for the main purpose or one of the main purposes to take advantage of these sub-paragraphs. In case a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, its competent authority shall in advance consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 3 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in one of the Contracting States and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other Contracting State, if one of the following requirements is fulfilled: 

(i) the payer or the recipient of the interest is the Government of a Contracting State itself, a public body, a political subdivision, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority thereof or the Central Bank of a Contracting State;  

(ii) the interest is paid in respect of a loan granted, approved, guaranteed or insured by the Government of a Contracting State, the Central Bank of a Contracting State, or any agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) owned or controlled by the Government of a Contracting State;  

(iii) the interest is paid in respect of a loan granted by a bank or any other financial institution (including an insurance company);  

(iv) the interest is paid on a loan made for a period of more than 2 years;  

(v) the interest is paid in connection with the sale on credit of any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment.     
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2 and 3.   
5.  The term “interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.   
6.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
7.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
8.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  12  

####Royalties

1.  Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 3 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.   
4.  The term “royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work (including motion pictures or films, recordings on tape or other media used for radio or television broadcasting or other means of transmission), any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of computer programs, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.   
5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.   
6.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  13  

####Capital gains

1.  Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State.

4.  Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.

### Article  14  

####Independent personal services

1.  Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities. If he has such a fixed base, the income may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so much of it as is attributable to that fixed base.   
2.  The term “professional services" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants.   

### Article  15

Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18, 19 and 20, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: 

a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned, and

2.  Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsman in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsman himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsman are exercised.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, income derived from activities as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State in which these activities are exercised, if the visit of the entertainers, the musicians or the sportsmen to that State is supported wholly or almost wholly from the public funds of the other Contracting State, a political subdivision, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority thereof, or if these activities are performed under a cultural or sports agreement between the Contracting States.

### CHAPTER  V  

####ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

### Article  24  

####Elimination of double taxation

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income or capital which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Romania.   
2.  However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 5 of Article 10, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraph 1 of Article 15, paragraph 3 of Article 18, paragraphs 1 (subparagraph a) and 2 (subparagraph a) of Article 19 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Convention may be taxed in Romania and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income or capital which according to paragraph 2 (subparagraphs b and c) of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 5 of Article 13, Article 16, Article 17, paragraph 2 of Article 18 and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 23 of this Convention may be taxed in Romania to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Romania on these items of income or capital, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income or capital so included were the sole items of income or capital which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.   
4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax for the tax paid in Romania on items of income which according to Article 7, paragraph 5 of Article 10, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, Article 14 and paragraph 2 of Article 22 of this Convention may be taxed in Romania to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, if and insofar as the Netherlands under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation allows a deduction from the Netherlands tax of the tax levied in another country on such items of income. For the computation of this deduction the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply accordingly.   
5.  In Romania, where a resident of Romania derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Netherlands, Romania shall allow: 

a) as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax paid in the Netherlands;  

b) as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident, an amount equal to the capital tax paid in the Netherlands.   Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax or capital tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or the capital which may be taxed in the Netherlands.   

### CHAPTER  VI  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  25  

####Offshore activities

1.  The provisions of this Article shall apply notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention. However, this Article shall not apply where offshore activities of a person constitute for that person a permanent establishment under the provisions of Article 5 or a fixed base under the provisions of Article 14.   
2.  In this Article the term “offshore activities" means activities which are carried on offshore in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea bed and its sub-soil and their natural resources, situated in a Contracting State.   
3.  An enterprise of a Contracting State which carries on offshore activities in the other Contracting State shall, subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, be deemed to be carrying on, in respect of those activities, business in that other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, unless the offshore activities in question are carried on in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 30 days in any period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph: 

a) where an enterprise carrying on offshore activities in the other Contracting State is associated with another enterprise and that other enterprise continues, as part of the same project, the same offshore activities that are or were being carried on by the first-mentioned enterprise, and the afore-mentioned activities carried on by both enterprises – when added together – exceed a period of 30 days, then each enterprise shall be deemed to be carrying on its activities for a period exceeding 30 days in a 12 months-period;  

b) an enterprise shall be regarded as associated with another enterprise if one holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of the other enterprise or if a person holds directly or indirectly at least one third of the capital of both enterprises.     
4.  However, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article the term “offshore activities" shall be deemed not to include: 

a) one or any combination of the activities mentioned in paragraph 4 of Article 5;  

b) towing or anchor handling by ships primarily designed for that purpose and any other activities performed by such ships;  

c) the transport of supplies or personnel by ships or aircraft in international traffic.     
5.  An individual who is a resident of a Contracting State and who carries on offshore activities in the other Contracting State, which consist of professional services or other activities of an independent character, shall be deemed to be performing those activities from a fixed base in the other Contracting State if the offshore activities in question last for a continuous period of 30 days or more.   
6.  Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment connected with offshore activities carried on through a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State may, to the extent that the employment is exercised offshore in that other State, be taxed in that other State.   
7.  Where documentary evidence is produced that tax has been paid in Romania on the items of income which may be taxed in Romania according to Article 7 and Article 14 in connection with respectively paragraph 3 and paragraph 5 of this Article, and to paragraph 6 of this Article, the Netherlands shall allow a reduction of its tax which shall be computed in conformity with the rules laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 24.   

### Article  26  

####Non-discrimination

1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 7 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  27  

####Mutual agreement procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 26, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   

### Article  28  

####Exchange of information

1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade,business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).     

### Article  29  

####Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts

Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.  

### Article  30  

####Territorial extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to either or both of the countries of the Netherlands Antilles or Aruba, if the country concerned imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to any country to which it has been extended under this Article.

a. hij wordt geacht slechts inwoner te zijn van de Staat waarin hij een duurzaam tehuis tot zijn beschikking heeft; indien hij in beide Staten een duurzaam tehuis tot zijn beschikking heeft, wordt hij geacht inwoner te zijn van de Staat waarmede zijn persoonlijke en economische betrekkingen het nauwst zijn (middelpunt van de levensbelangen);  

b. indien niet kan worden bepaald in welke Staat hij het middelpunt van zijn levensbelangen heeft, of indien hij in geen van de Staten een duurzaam tehuis tot zijn beschikking heeft, wordt hij geacht slechts inwoner te zijn van de Staat waarin hij gewoonlijk verblijft;  

c. indien hij in beide Staten of in geen van beide gewoonlijk verblijft, wordt hij geacht slechts inwoner te zijn van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is;  

d. indien hij onderdaan is van beide Staten of van geen van beide, regelen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming.     
3.  Indien een andere dan een natuurlijke persoon ingevolge de bepalingen van het eerste lid inwoner van beide Verdragsluitende Staten is, wordt hij geacht slechts inwoner te zijn van de Staat waar zijn plaats van werkelijke leiding is gelegen.   
4.  Een pensioenfonds, dat als zodanig is erkend in een Verdragsluitende Staat en waarvan het inkomen in het algemeen is vrijgesteld van belasting in die Staat, wordt beschouwd als inwoner van die Staat. Als een erkend pensioenfonds van een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt beschouwd elk pensioenfonds dat volgens wettelijke bepalingen van die Staat is erkend en onder toezicht staat.   

### Artikel  5  

####Vaste inrichting

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag betekent de uitdrukking „vaste inrichting" een vaste bedrijfsinrichting door middel waarvan de werkzaamheden van een onderneming geheel of gedeeltelijk worden uitgeoefend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vaste inrichting" omvat in het bijzonder: 

a. een plaats waar leiding wordt gegeven;  

b. een filiaal;  

c. een kantoor;  

d. een fabriek;  

e. een werkplaats, en  

f. een mijn, een olie- of gasbron, een (steen)groeve of een andere plaats waar natuurlijke rijkdommen worden gewonnen.     
3.  Een plaats van uitvoering van een bouwwerk of van constructie- of montagewerkzaamheden vormt alleen een vaste inrichting indien de duur ervan twaalf maanden overschrijdt.   
4.  Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van dit artikel wordt de uitdrukking „vaste inrichting" niet geacht te omvatten: 

a. het gebruik maken van inrichtingen, uitsluitend voor opslag, uitstalling of aflevering van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar;  

b. het aanhouden van een voorraad van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar, die tentoongesteld wordt op een beurs of tentoonstelling, en die door de onderneming bij het einde van die beurs of tentoonstelling wordt verkocht;  

c. het aanhouden van een voorraad van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar, uitsluitend voor opslag, uitstalling of aflevering;  

d. het aanhouden van een voorraad van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar, uitsluitend voor bewerking of verwerking door een andere onderneming;  

e. het aanhouden van een vaste bedrijfsinrichting, uitsluitend om voor de onderneming goederen of koopwaar aan te kopen of inlichtingen in te winnen of te verspreiden, of marktonderzoek te doen dat van voorbereidende aard is of het karakter van hulpwerkzaamheid heeft;  

f. de vergemakkelijking van het afsluiten (met inbegrip van de enkele ondertekening) van overeenkomsten betreffende leningen, betreffende de levering van goederen of koopwaar of betreffende verlening van technische diensten, welk afsluiten van overeenkomsten soortgelijk is aan de activiteiten van een vertegenwoordigerskantoor in Roemenië;  

g. het aanhouden van een vaste bedrijfsinrichting, uitsluitend om voor de onderneming enige andere werkzaamheid uit te oefenen die van voorbereidende aard is of het karakter van hulpwerkzaamheid heeft;  

h. het aanhouden van een vaste bedrijfsinrichting, uitsluitend voor een combinatie van de in de letters a) tot en met g) genoemde werkzaamheden, mits het totaal van de werkzaamheden van de vaste bedrijfsinrichting dat uit deze combinatie voortvloeit van voorbereidende aard is of het karakter van hulpwerkzaamheid heeft.     
5.  Indien een persoon – niet zijnde een onafhankelijke vertegenwoordiger waarop het zesde lid van toepassing is – voor een onderneming werkzaam is, en een machtiging bezit om namens de onderneming overeenkomsten af te sluiten en dit recht in een Verdragsluitende Staat gewoonlijk uitoefent, wordt die onderneming, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid, geacht in die Staat een vaste inrichting te hebben met betrekking tot de werkzaamheden die die persoon voor de onderneming verricht, tenzij de werkzaamheden van die persoon beperkt blijven tot die werkzaamheden genoemd in het vierde lid, die, indien zij worden uitgeoefend door middel van een vaste bedrijfsinrichting, deze vaste bedrijfsinrichting op grond van de bepalingen van dat lid niet tot een vaste inrichting zouden maken.   
6.  Een onderneming wordt niet geacht een vaste inrichting in een Verdragsluitende Staat te bezitten alleen op grond van de omstandigheid dat zij in die Staat zaken doet door bemiddeling van een makelaar, commissionair of enige andere onafhankelijke vertegenwoordiger, mits deze personen in de normale uitoefening van hun bedrijf handelen.   
7.  De omstandigheid dat een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, een lichaam beheerst of door een lichaam wordt beheerst dat inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat of dat in die andere Staat zaken doet (hetzij door middel van een vaste inrichting, hetzij op andere wijze), stempelt een van beide lichamen niet tot een vaste inrichting van het andere.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####BELASTINGHEFFING NAAR HET INKOMEN

### Artikel  6  

####Inkomsten uit onroerende zaken

1.  Inkomsten verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat uit onroerende zaken (waaronder begrepen voordelen uit landbouw- of bosbedrijven) die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat zijn gelegen mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  De uitdrukking „onroerende zaken" heeft de betekenis welke die uitdrukking heeft volgens de wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin de desbetreffende zaken zijn gelegen. De uitdrukking omvat in ieder geval de zaken die bij de onroerende zaken behoren, levende en dode have van landbouw- en bosbedrijven, rechten waarop de bepalingen van het privaatrecht betreffende de grondeigendom van toepassing zijn, vruchtgebruik van onroerende zaken en rechten op veranderlijke of vaste vergoedingen ter zake van de exploitatie, of concessie tot exploitatie, van minerale aardlagen, bronnen en andere natuurlijke rijkdommen; schepen, boten, luchtvaartuigen en spoorwegvoertuigen worden niet als onroerende zaken beschouwd.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn van toepassing op de inkomsten verkregen uit de rechtstreekse exploitatie, uit het verhuren of verpachten, of uit elke andere vorm van exploitatie van onroerende zaken.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en derde lid zijn ook van toepassing op inkomsten uit onroerende zaken van een onderneming en op inkomsten uit onroerende zaken die worden gebruikt voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid.   

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten, daaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten, die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voor zover het in een Verdragsluitende Staat gebruikelijk is de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet het tweede lid die Verdragsluitende Staat niet de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Er worden geen voordelen aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van de aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van dit Verdrag worden behandeld, laten de bepalingen van dit artikel de bepalingen van die artikelen onverlet.   

### Artikel  8  

####Internationaal verkeer

1.  Voordelen uit de exploitatie van schepen, luchtvaartuigen of spoorwegvoertuigen in internationaal verkeer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
2.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een zeescheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvatten voordelen verkregen uit de exploitatie van schepen, luchtvaartuigen en spoorwegvoertuigen in internationaal verkeer mede voordelen behaald met de verhuur op basis van verhuur zonder bemanning van schepen, luchtvaartuigen en spoorwegvoertuigen die in het internationale verkeer worden geëxploiteerd indien deze huuropbrengsten voortvloeien uit de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool", een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a. een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, of  

b. dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat en een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat,   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast. Het is echter wel te verstaan, dat de omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten, zoals „costsharing"-overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in de voorgaande zin.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt – en dienovereenkomstig belast – ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstgenoemde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a. 0 percent van het bruto bedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam is (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma), dat onmiddellijk ten minste 25 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b. 5 percent van het bruto bedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam is (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma), dat onmiddellijk ten minste 10 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

c. 15 percent van het bruto bedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen.   Dit lid laat onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De uitdrukking „dividenden", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten, met uitzondering van schuldvorderingen, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst alsmede inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten, die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de winsten uitdeelt inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en het tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   
7.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid, onderdelen a en b, zijn niet van toepassing indien de verhouding tussen de twee lichamen is opgezet of in stand wordt gehouden met het voornaamste doel of een van de voornaamste doelen de voordelen van deze onderdelen te genieten. In geval een Verdragsluitende Staat voornemens is om dit lid toe te passen, overlegt de bevoegde autoriteit van tevoren met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat mag in de andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 3 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, is interest afkomstig uit een van de Verdragsluitende Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat die de uiteindelijk gerechtigde daartoe is, slechts belastbaar in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat indien aan een van de volgende voorwaarden wordt voldaan: 

i. de schuldenaar of de genieter van de interest is de Regering van een Verdragsluitende Staat zelf, een openbaar lichaam, een staatkundig onderdeel, een territoriaal-administratief onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan of de Centrale Bank van de Verdragsluitende Staat;  

ii. de interest wordt betaald ter zake van een lening, verstrekt, goedgekeurd, gegarandeerd of verzekerd door de Regering van een Verdragsluitende Staat, de Centrale Bank van een Verdragsluitende Staat of enig agentschap dat of enige instantie (daaronder begrepen een financiële instelling) die eigendom is van of wordt beheerst door de Regering van een Verdragsluitende Staat;  

iii. de interest wordt betaald ter zake van een lening, verstrekt door een bank of een andere financiële instelling (daaronder begrepen een verzekeringsmaatschappij);  

iv. de interest wordt betaald ter zake van een lening met een looptijd van meer dan twee jaar;  

v. de interest wordt betaald in verband met de verkoop op afbetaling van nijverheids- of handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting.     
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede en derde lid.   
5.  De uitdrukking „interest", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek, en al dan niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen. In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
7.  Interest wordt geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn indien de schuldenaar een inwoner is van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
8.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een Verdragsluitende Staat en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's een inwoner is van die andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mag de aldus geheven belasting 3 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De uitdrukking „royalty's", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap (daaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms of speelfilms, bandopnames of andere media die voor radio- of televisie-uitzendingen of andere uitzendmiddelen worden gebruikt), een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, of voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op computerprogramma's, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat, in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
6.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstig te zijn indien de schuldenaar een inwoner is van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, ongeacht of hij inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat is of niet, in een Verdragsluitende Staat een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
7.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  13  

####Vermogenswinsten

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat uit de vervreemding van onroerende zaken zoals bedoeld in artikel 6 en die zijn gelegen in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende goederen die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, of van roerende goederen die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, waaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen uit de vervreemding van schepen, luchtvaartuigen of spoorwegvoertuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende goederen die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen, luchtvaartuigen of spoorwegvoertuigen, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen. Voor de toepassing van dit lid zijn de bepalingen van het tweede lid van artikel 8 van toepassing.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere goederen dan die bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  De bepalingen van het vierde lid laten onverlet het recht van elk van de Verdragsluitende Staten overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving belasting te heffen over voordelen die uit de vervreemding van aandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld en dat volgens de wetgeving van die Staat inwoner is van die Staat, worden verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat en die in de loop van de laatste tien jaren voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de aandelen of winstbewijzen inwoner van de eerstgenoemde Staat is geweest.   

### Artikel  14  

####Zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de uitoefening van een vrij beroep of ter zake van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij hij in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat voor het verrichten van zijn werkzaamheden geregeld over een vast middelpunt beschikt. Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep" omvat in het bijzonder zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.   

### Artikel  15  

####Niet-zelfstandige arbeid

1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van de artikelen 16, 18, 19 en 20 zijn salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen, verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een dienstbetrekking slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de dienstbetrekking in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat wordt uitgeoefend. Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste lid is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat uitgeoefende dienstbetrekking slechts in de eerstgenoemde Staat belastbaar, indien: 

a. de genieter in de andere Staat verblijft gedurende een tijdvak of tijdvakken, die in een tijdvak van twaalf maanden beginnend of eindigend in het desbetreffende belastingjaar een totaal van 183 dagen niet te boven gaan, en  

b. de beloning wordt betaald door of namens een werkgever die geen inwoner van de andere Staat is, en  

c. de beloning niet ten laste komt van een vaste inrichting die, of van een vast middelpunt dat, de werkgever in de andere Staat heeft.     
3.  Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van dit artikel is de beloning verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een dienstbetrekking uitgeoefend aan boord van een schip, luchtvaartuig of spoorwegvoertuig dat in internationaal verkeer wordt geëxploiteerd, slechts in die Staat belastbaar.   

### Artikel  16  

####Directeursbeloningen

Directeursbeloningen of andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat in zijn hoedanigheid van lid van de raad van beheer, van bestuurder of van commissaris van een lichaam dat inwoner is van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.  

### Artikel  17  

####Artiesten en sportbeoefenaars

Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 14 en 15, mogen voordelen of inkomsten, verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat als artiest, zoals een toneelspeler, film-, radio-, of televisie-artiest of een musicus, of als sportbeoefenaar, uit zijn persoonlijke werkzaamheden als zodanig die worden verricht in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, worden belast in die andere Staat.   
2.  Indien voordelen of inkomsten ter zake van persoonlijke werkzaamheden die door een artiest of een sportbeoefenaar in die hoedanigheid worden verricht, niet aan de artiest of sportbeoefenaar zelf toekomen, maar aan een andere persoon, mogen die voordelen of inkomsten, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van de artikelen 7, 14 en 15, worden belast in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin de werkzaamheden van de artiest of sportbeoefenaar worden verricht.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel, zijn voordelen of inkomsten verkregen uit werkzaamheden als omschreven in het eerste lid van dit artikel vrijgesteld van belasting in de Verdragsluitende Staat waarin deze werkzaamheden worden verricht, indien het bezoek van de artiesten, de musici of de sportbeoefenaars aan die Staat geheel of nagenoeg geheel wordt bekostigd uit de openbare middelen van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, een staatkundig onderdeel, een territoriaal-administratief onderdeel of een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam daarvan, of indien deze werkzaamheden worden verricht in het kader van een culturele of sportovereenkomst tussen de Verdragsluitende Staten.

2.  Indien deze beloningen echter geen periodiek karakter dragen en worden betaald ter zake van een vroegere dienstbetrekking in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, of indien in plaats van het recht op lijfrenten een afkoopsom wordt betaald, mogen de beloningen of deze afkoopsom in de Verdragsluitende Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn worden belast.   
3.  Pensioenen en andere uitkeringen betaald krachtens de bepalingen van een sociaal-zekerheidsstelsel van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen in de eerstgenoemde Staat worden belast.   
4.  De uitdrukking „lijfrente" betekent een vaste som, periodiek betaalbaar op vaste tijdstippen, hetzij gedurende het leven, hetzij gedurende een vastgesteld of voor vaststelling vatbaar tijdvak, ingevolge een verbintenis tot het doen van betalingen, welke tegenover een voldoende en volledige tegenprestatie in geld of geldswaarde staat.

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  24  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Roemenië mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, vijfde lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste lid, artikel 18, derde lid, artikel 19, eerste lid (onderdeel a) en tweede lid (onderdeel a) en artikel 22, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Roemenië mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomensbestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde inkomensbestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid (onderdelen b en c), artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 13, vijfde lid, artikel 16, artikel 17, artikel 18, tweede lid en artikel 23, eerste en tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Roemenië mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Roemenië over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen of het vermogen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
4.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid, verleent Nederland een aftrek op de Nederlandse belasting voor de in Roemenië betaalde belasting op bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 7, artikel 10, vijfde lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, artikel 12, vijfde lid, artikel 14, en artikel 22, tweede lid, van dit Verdrag in Roemenië mogen worden belast, voor zover deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, indien en voor zover Nederland uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting een aftrek verleent op de Nederlandse belasting voor de in een ander land over die bestanddelen van het inkomen geheven belasting. Voor de berekening van deze aftrek zijn de bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel van overeenkomstige toepassing.   
5.  In Roemenië, verleent Roemenië, indien een inwoner van Roemenië inkomen verkrijgt of vermogen bezit dat volgens de bepalingen van dit Verdrag in Nederland mag worden belast: 

a. een aftrek op de belasting naar het inkomen van die inwoner, gelijk aan het bedrag van de in Nederland betaalde inkomstenbelasting;  

b. een aftrek op de belasting naar het vermogen van die inwoner, gelijk aan het bedrag van de in Nederland betaalde vermogensbelasting.   Deze aftrek bedraagt echter in geen geval meer dan het gedeelte van de belasting naar het inkomen of de belasting naar het vermogen, zoals berekend voordat de aftrek is verleend, dat, naar gelang van het geval, toerekenbaar is aan het inkomen of het vermogen dat in Nederland mag worden belast.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  25  

####Werkzaamheden buitengaats

1.  De bepalingen van dit artikel vinden toepassing niettegenstaande enigerlei andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag. Dit artikel is echter niet van toepassing indien werkzaamheden buitengaats van een persoon voor die persoon een vaste inrichting vormen ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 5 of een vast middelpunt ingevolge de bepalingen van artikel 14.   
2.  In dit artikel betekent de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats" werkzaamheden die buitengaats worden verricht in verband met de exploratie of exploitatie van de in een Verdragsluitende Staat gelegen zeebodem en de ondergrond daarvan en hun natuurlijke rijkdommen.   
3.  Een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht wordt, behoudens het in het vierde lid van dit artikel bepaalde, geacht ter zake van die werkzaamheden in de andere Staat een bedrijf uit te oefenen door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, tenzij de desbetreffende werkzaamheden buitengaats in de andere Staat worden verricht gedurende een tijdvak of tijdvakken die in een tijdvak van twaalf maanden een totaal van 30 dagen niet te boven gaan. Voor de toepassing van dit lid wordt: 

a. indien een onderneming die in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht en die is gelieerd aan een andere onderneming, welke andere onderneming als onderdeel van hetzelfde project dezelfde werkzaamheden buitengaats voortzet die worden of werden uitgevoerd door de eerstbedoelde onderneming, en de hiervoor bedoelde door beide ondernemingen verrichte activiteiten bij elkaar opgeteld een tijdvak van 30 dagen te boven gaan, iedere onderneming geacht haar werkzaamheden uit te oefenen gedurende een tijdvak dat 30 dagen in een tijdvak van twaalf maanden te boven gaat;  

b. een onderneming geacht gelieerd te zijn aan een andere onderneming indien de een onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van de andere onderneming bezit of indien een persoon onmiddellijk of middellijk ten minste een derde deel van het kapitaal van beide ondernemingen bezit.     
4.  Voor de toepassing van het derde lid van dit artikel wordt de uitdrukking „werkzaamheden buitengaats" evenwel geacht niet te omvatten: 

a. een van de activiteiten of een combinatie daarvan als genoemd in artikel 5, vierde lid;  

b. sleep- of ankerwerkzaamheden door schepen die in de eerste plaats voor dat doel zijn ontworpen alsmede andere door zulke schepen verrichte activiteiten;  

c. het vervoer van voorraden of personeel door schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer.     
5.  Een natuurlijke persoon, die inwoner is van een Verdragsluitende Staat en die in het kader van een vrij beroep of van andere werkzaamheden van zelfstandige aard in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat werkzaamheden buitengaats verricht, wordt geacht deze werkzaamheden te verrichten vanuit een vast middelpunt in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat indien de desbetreffende werkzaamheden buitengaats een aaneengesloten tijdvak van 30 dagen of meer beslaan.   
6.  Salarissen, lonen en andere soortgelijke beloningen verkregen door een inwoner van een Verdragsluitende Staat ter zake van een dienstbetrekking in verband met werkzaamheden buitengaats die worden verricht door middel van een vaste inrichting in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, mogen, voor zover de dienstbetrekking in die andere Staat buitengaats wordt uitgeoefend, in die andere Staat worden belast.   
7.  Indien aan de hand van bewijsstukken wordt aangetoond dat in Roemenië belasting is betaald over de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge artikel 7 en artikel 14 in verband met het derde onderscheidenlijk het vijfde lid van dit artikel en ingevolge het zesde lid van dit artikel in Roemenië mogen worden belast, verleent Nederland een vermindering van zijn belasting, die wordt berekend overeenkomstig de regels die zijn neergelegd in artikel 24, tweede lid.   

### Artikel  26  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een Verdragsluitende Staat worden in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden, in het bijzonder de woonstaat betreffende, zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoners zijn van een of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat in de andere Verdragsluitende Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, achtste lid, of artikel 12, zevende lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven betaald door een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat. Zo ook zijn alle schulden van een onderneming van een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een inwoner van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat bij de vaststelling van het belastbare vermogen van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij waren aangegaan met een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een Verdragsluitende Staat, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  27  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een of van beide Verdragsluitende Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 26, eerste lid, aan die van de Verdragsluitende Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van het Verdrag, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met het Verdrag, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van het Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen die niet in het Verdrag zijn geregeld.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Verdragsluitende Staten wisselen de inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor het uitvoeren van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag of van de nationale wetgeving van de Verdragsluitende Staten met betrekking tot de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is, voor zover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met het Verdrag. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een Verdragsluitende Staat ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (daaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. Zij mogen de inlichtingen bekend maken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid aldus uitgelegd dat zij een Verdragsluitende Staat de verplichting opleggen: 

a. administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

b. inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn volgens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Verdragsluitende Staat;  

c. inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids- of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, dan wel inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde (ordre public).     

### Artikel  29  

####Leden van diplomatieke vertegenwoordigingen en consulaire posten

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die leden van diplomatieke vertegenwoordigingen of consulaire posten ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  30  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Dit Verdrag kan, hetzij in zijn geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot elk van de landen of beide landen van de Nederlandse Antillen of Aruba, indien het desbetreffende land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop het Verdrag van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, daaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van het Verdrag niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van het Verdrag tot enig land waartoe het ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VII

De bepalingen van het eerstgenoemde Verdrag blijven echter van toepassing voor belastingjaren en -tijdvakken, die zijn verstreken voor het tijdstip waarop de bepalingen van dit Verdrag toepassing vinden.   

### Artikel  32  

####Beëindiging

Dit Verdrag blijft van kracht totdat het door een Verdragsluitende Staat wordt beëindigd.
