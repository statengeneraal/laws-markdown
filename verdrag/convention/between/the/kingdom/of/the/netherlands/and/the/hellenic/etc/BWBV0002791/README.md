The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.   

### CHAPTER  III  

####TAXATION OF INCOME

### Article  6

### Article  7  

####Business profits

1.  The profits of an enterprise of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in one of the States to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in his Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.   

### Article  8  

####Shipping and air transport

1.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6 of Article 7 shall not affect the application of the provisions of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Greece, signed at Athens the 26th of July, 1951, for reciprocal exemption from taxes on income with respect to certain profits derived from international shipping and air transport enterprises.   
2.  The provisions of the Agreement mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.   

### Article  9  

####Associated enterprises

1.  Where 

a) an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial of financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.     
2.  Where one of the States includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.   

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.   
2.  However, such dividends may also be taxed in the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed: 

a) with respect to dividends paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a resident of Greece: 

(i) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;  

(ii) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases;    

b) with respect to dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Greece to a resident of the Netherlands: 35 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of these limitations. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.     
3.  The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, "jouissance" shares or "jouissance" rights, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as income from debt-claims participating in profits, and income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business in the other State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectivily connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   

### Article  11  

####Interest

The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of these limitations.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is born by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  12

a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties, if the royalties consist of payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films;  

b) 7 per cent of the gross amount of all other royalties.   The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of these limitations.   
3.  The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.   
5.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.   
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  13  

####Limitation of Articles 10, 11 and 12

For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.  

3. Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 (b) of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 5 of Article 14, paragraph 3 of Article 16, Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Article 19 of this Convention may be taxed in Greece to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Greece on these items of income, provided that in the case of dividends not more than 15 percent of the gross amount thereof is taken into account, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.    

B. In the case of Greece: 

1. Greece, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income or capital which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Netherlands.  

2. Where a resident of Greece derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Netherlands, Greece shall allow: 

(i) as a deduction from the tax on income of that resident, an amount equal to the tax on income paid in the Netherlands;  

(ii) as a deduction from the tax on capital of that resident, an amount equal to the tax paid in the Netherlands.   Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax on income or on capital, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or the capital which may be taxed in the Netherlands.      

### CHAPTER  VI  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  26  

####Non-discrimination

1.  Nationals of one of the States shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the States.   
2.  The term "nationals" means: 

a) all individuals possessing the nationality of one of the States;  

b) all legal persons, partnerships and associations deriving their status as such from the laws in force in one of the States.     
3.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging one of the States to grant to residents of the other State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
4.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 6 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
5.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
6.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  27  

####Mutual agreement procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 26, to that of the State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. When it seems advisable in order to reach agreement to have an oral exchange of opinions, such exchange may take place through a Commission consisting of representatives of the competent authorities of the States.   

### Article  28  

####Exchange of information

1.  The competent authorities of the States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by one of the States shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).     

### Article  29  

####Diplomatic agents and consular officers

Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.  

### Article  30  

####Territorial extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to the Netherlands Antilles, if that country imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which this Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to the Netherlands Antilles.   

### CHAPTER  VII  

####FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article  31  

####Entry into force

1.  The Contracting Governments shall notify each other in writing that the formalities constitutionally required in their respective countries for the entry into force of this Convention have been complied with.   
2.  The Convention shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later of the notifications referred to in paragraph 1 and its provisions shall have effect for taxable years and periods beginning on or after the first day of January of 1981.   

### Article  32  

####Termination

This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Contracting Governments. Either Government may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the year 1986. In such event the Convention shall cease to have effect for taxable years and periods beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination has been given.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Convention.

### Protocol  

####At the moment of signing the Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital, this day concluded between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hellenic Republic, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.

### I  

####Ad Article 10

It is agreed that since the difference between the provisions of sub-paragraph a) and those of sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 10 is based on the fact that according to the Greek income tax on legal entities as in force at the date of signature of the Convention dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Greece are deductible in the computation of the profits of the company paying the dividends, the two Governments will undertake the review of the said provisions in order to adapt sub-paragraph b) to sub-paragraph a) when the basis of such difference no longer exists.  

### II  

####Ad Articles 10, 11 and 12

Applications for the restitution of tax levied contrary to the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12 have to be lodged with the competent authority of the State having levied the tax within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.  

### III  

####Ad Article 17

It is understood that "bestuurder" or "commissaris" of a Netherlands company means persons, who are nominated as such by the general meeting of shareholders or by any other competent body of such company and are charged with the general management of the company and the supervision thereof, respectively.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Protocol. DONE at Athens, this day of 16 July 1981, in two originals, each in the Netherlands, Greek and English languages, the three texts being equally authentic.

4.  Niettegenstaande de voorgaande bepalingen van dit artikel wordt een vaste inrichting niet aanwezig geacht, indien: 

a) gebruik wordt gemaakt van inrichtingen, uitsluitend voor de opslag, uitstalling of aflevering van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar;  

b) een voorraad van aan de onderneming toebehorende goederen of koopwaar wordt aangehouden, uitsluitend voor de opslag, uitstalling of aflevering;

7.  De enkele omstandigheid dat een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, een lichaam beheerst of door een lichaam wordt beheerst, dat inwoner is van de andere Staat of dat in die andere Staat zaken doet (hetzij door middel van een vaste inrichting, hetzij op andere wijze), stempelt een van de beide lichamen niet tot een vaste inrichting van het andere.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####BELASTINGHEFFING NAAR HET INKOMEN

### Artikel  6  

####Inkomsten uit onroerende goederen

1.  Inkomsten verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit onroerende goederen (daaronder begrepen voordelen uit landbouw- of bosbedrijven) die in de andere Staat zijn gelegen mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  De uitdrukking ,,onroerende goederen” heeft de betekenis welke die uitdrukking heeft volgens de wetgeving van de Staat waar de desbetreffende goederen zijn gelegen. De uitdrukking omvat in ieder geval de goederen die bij de onroerende goederen behoren, levende en dode have van landbouw- en bosbouwbedrijven, rechten waarop de bepaling van het privaatrecht betreffende de grondeigendom van toepassing zijn, vruchtgebruik van onroerende goederen en rechten op veranderlijke of vaste vergoedingen ter zake van de exploitatie, of concessie tot exploitatie van minerale aardlagen, bronnen en andere natuurlijke rijkdommen; schepen en luchtvaartuigen worden niet als onroerende goederen beschouwd.   
3.  De bepaling van het eerste lid is van toepassing op de inkomsten verkregen uit de rechtstreekse exploitatie, uit het verhuren of verpachten, of uit elke andere vorm van exploitatie van onroerende goederen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en derde lid zijn ook van toepassing op inkomsten uit onroerende goederen van een onderneming en op inkomsten uit onroerende goederen gebezigd voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid.   

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - daaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voorzover het in een van de Staten gebruikelijk is de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet het tweede lid die Staat niet de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Geen voordelen worden aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat om hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

####Zeevaart en luchtvaart

1.  De bepalingen van het eerste tot en met het zesde lid van artikel 7 laten onverlet de toepassing van de bepalingen van de op 26 juli 1951 te Athene ondertekende Overeenkomst tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Griekenland tot wederzijdse vrijstelling van de belastingen op inkomsten van bepaalde voordelen, voortvloeiende uit internationale zeevaart-, scheepvaart- of luchtvaartondernemingen.   
2.  De bepalingen van de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde Overeenkomst zijn eveneens van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool”, een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal geëxploiteerd agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a) een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b) dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat, en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.     
2.  Indien een van de Staten in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt - en dienovereenkomstig belast - ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de twee ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig herzien. Bij deze herziening wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) met betrekking tot dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van Nederland aan een inwoner van Griekenland: 

(i) 5 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden indien de uiteinjk gerechtigde een lichaam (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma) is, dat onmiddellijk ten minste 25 pereent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

(ii) 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen;    

b) met betrekking tot dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van Griekenland aan een inwoner van Nederland: 35 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden.   De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van deze beperkingen. Dit lid laat onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
3.  De uitdrukking ,,dividenden”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst en inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten, die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 15 van toepassing.   
5.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mag in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze interest mag echter ook in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest is, mag de aldus geheven belasting 10 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet overschrijden, met dien verstande dat, indien deze interest wordt betaald aan een bank of een financiële instelling, de aldus geheven belasting 8 percent van het brutobedrag van de interest niet mag overschrijden. De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van deze beperkingen.   
3.  De uitdrukking ,,interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek doch niet aanspraak gevende op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, daaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen. In rekening gebrachte boete voor te late betaling wordt voor de toepassing van dit artikel niet als interest aangemerkt.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de schuldvordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroeps vermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 15 van toepassing.   
5.  Interest wordt geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij wordt betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de interest betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de schuld ter zake waarvan de interest wordt betaald, was aangegaan, en deze interest ten laste komt van die vaste inrichting of dat vaste middelpunt, wordt deze interest geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gelegen.   
6.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan zij wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty 's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty's mogen echter ook in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 5 percent van het brutobedrag van de royalty's, indien de royalty's bestaan uit vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap - daaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms -;  

b) 7 percent van het brutobedrag van alle andere royalty's.   De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van deze beperkingen.   
3.  De uitdrukking „royalty's", zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst- of wetenschap - daaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms -, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, dan wel voor het gebruik van, of het recht van gebruik van, nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel vaneen aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's verschuldigd zijn, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 15 van toepassing.   
5.  Royalty's worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty's betaalt, of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting of een vast middelpunt heeft, waarvoor de verplichting tot het betalen van de royalty's was aangegaan, en deze royalty's ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting of van dat vaste middelpunt, worden deze royalty's geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting of het vaste middelpunt is gevestigd.   
6.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13  

####Beperking van de artikelen 10, 11 en 12

Internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, alsmede personen die deel uitmaken van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat, die in een van de Staten verblijven, hebben in de andere Staat geen recht op de verminderingen van belasting voorzien in de artikelen 10, 11 en 12, met betrekking tot uit die andere Staat afkomstige bestanddelen van het inkomen die in deze artikelen zijn behandeld, indien die bestanddelen van het inkomen in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan een belasting naar het inkomen zijn onderworpen.  

### Artikel  14  

####Vermogenswinsten

1.  Voordelen verkregen door een inwoner van een van de Staten uit de vervreemding van onroerende goederen, zoals bedoeld in artikel 6 en die zijn gelegen in de andere Staat mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.

Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van roerende zaken die deel uitmaken van het bedrijfsvermogen van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, of van roerende zaken die behoren tot een vast middelpunt dat een inwoner van een van de Staten in de andere Staat tot zijn beschikking heeft voor het verrichten van zelfstandige arbeid, daaronder begrepen voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van de vaste inrichting (alleen of met de gehele onderneming) of van het vaste middelpunt, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
3.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen of luchtvaartuigen, die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd, en van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen, zijn belastbaar in de Staat waar de voordelen verkregen uit de exploitatie van deze schepen of luchtvaartuigen belastbaar zijn overeenkomstig de bepalingen van de in artikel 8 van deze Overeenkomst genoemde Overeenkomst.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere zaken dan die bedoeld in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  De bepaling van het vierde lid tast niet aan het recht van elk van de Staten overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving belasting te heffen op voordelen uit de vervreemding van aandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele in aandelen is verdeeld en dat inwoner is van die Staat, verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Staat en die in de loop van de laatste vijf jaren voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de aandelen of winstbewijzen inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest.

Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking ,,vrij beroep” sluit in het bijzonder in zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.

b) de beloning wordt betaald door of namens een werkgever die geen inwoner van de andere Staat is, en  

c) de beloning niet ten laste komt van een vaste inrichting die, of van een vast middelpunt dat de werkgever in de andere Staat heeft.

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  25  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

Overeengekomen wordt dat dubbele belasting op de volgende wijze wordt vermeden: 

A. Wat Nederland betreft: 

1. Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Griekenland mogen worden belast.  

2. Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt of vermogensbestanddelen bezit die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, vierde lid, artikel 11, vierde lid, artikel 12, vierde lid, artikel 14, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 15, artikel 16, eerste lid, artikel 17, eerste lid, artikel 20, artikel 23, tweede lid, en artikel 24, eerste en tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Griekenland mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze bestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde bestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.  

3. Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, letter b, artikel 11, tweede lid, artikel 12, tweede lid, artikel 14, vijfde lid, artikel 16, derde lid, artikel 18 en artikel 19, tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Griekenland mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in Griekenland over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, met dien verstande dat in het geval van dividenden niet meer dan 15 percent van het brutobedrag daarvan in aanmerking wordt genomen, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.    

B. Wat Griekenland betreft: 

1. Griekenland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nederland mogen worden belast.  

2. Indien een inwoner van Griekenland inkomsten verkrijgt of vermogensbestanddelen bezit die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nederland mogen worden belast, verleent Griekenland: 

(i) een vermindering op de belasting naar het inkomen van die inwoner, tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Nederland over de inkomsten betaalde belasting;  

(ii) een vermindering op de belasting over het vermogen van die inwoner, tot een bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Nederland betaalde belasting.   Deze vermindering overschrijdt echter in geen van beide gevallen dat deel van de belasting naar het inkomen of naar het vermogen, zoals deze berekend is vóór het verlenen van de vermindering, dat, naar gelang van het geval, aan de inkomsten of de vermogensbestanddelen die in Nederland mogen worden belast kan worden toegerekend.      

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  26  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoner zijn van een van de Staten of van beide Staten.   
2.  De uitdrukking ,,onderdanen” betekent: 

a) alle natuurlijke personen die de nationaliteit van een van de Staten bezitten;  

b) alle rechtspersonen, vennootschappen en verenigingen die hun rechtspositie als zodanig ontlenen aan de wetgeving die in een van de Staten van kracht is.     
3.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
4.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, zesde lid, of artikel 12, zesde lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat. Zo ook zijn alle schulden van een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat bij de vaststelling van het belastbare vermogen van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij waren aangegaan met een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
5.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere, soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
6.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  27  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 26, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaren nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst, voor het eerst te zijner kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de Overeenkomst, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van de Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarvoor in de Overeenkomst geen voorziening is getroffen.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken. Indien het voor het bereiken van overeenstemming raadzaam voorkomt mondeling van gedachten te wisselen, kan zulk een gedachtenwisseling plaatsvinden in een commissie bestaande uit vertegenwoordigers van de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen zodanige inlichtingen uit als nodig zijn om uitvoering te geven aan de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst of aan de nationale wetgeving van de Staten met betrekking tot de belastingen waarop de Overeenkomst van toepassing is, voor zover de heffing van die belastingen niet in strijd is met de Overeenkomst. De uitwisseling van inlichtingen wordt niet beperkt door artikel 1. Alle door een van de Staten ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (daaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging of vervolging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen waarop de Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. Zij mogen de inlichtingen bekend maken in openbare rechtszittingen of in rechterlijke beslissingen.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid aldus uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a) administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b) inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn volgens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c) inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, dan wel inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  29  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  30  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot de Nederlandse Antillen, indien dat land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, daaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van de Overeenkomst niet met zich mee, dat tevens de uitbreiding van de Overeenkomst tot de Nederlandse Antillen wordt beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####SLOTBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  31  

####Inwerkingtreding

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen delen elkaar schriftelijk mede, dat de in hun onderscheiden landen grondwettelijk vereiste formaliteiten voor de inwerkingtreding van deze Overeenkomst zijn vervuld.   
2.  De Overeenkomst treedt in werking op de dag waarop de laatste van de in het eerste lid bedoelde kennisgevingen is ontvangen en haar bepalingen vinden toepassing voor belastingjaren en -tijdvakken die aanvangen op of na 1 januari 1981.   

### Artikel  32  

####Beëindiging

Deze Overeenkomst blijft van kracht totdat zij door een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen is beëindigd. Elk van de Regeringen kan de Overeenkomst langs diplomatieke weg beëindigen door ten minste zes maanden voor het einde van enig kalenderjaar na het jaar 1986 een kennisgeving van beëindiging te zenden.

### Protocol  

####Bij de ondertekening van de Overeenkomst tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting en het voorkomen van het ontgaan van belasting met betrekking tot belastingen naar het inkomen en naar het vermogen, heden tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Helleense Republiek gesloten, zijn de ondergetekenden overeengekomen dat de volgende bepalingen een integrerend deel van de Overeenkomst vormen.

### I  

####Ad Artikel 10

Aangezien het verschil tussen de bepalingen van artikel 10, tweede lid, letter a) en die van letter b) gebaseerd is op het feit dat volgens de Griekse inkomstenbelasting voor rechtspersonen, zoals die geldt op het tijdstip van ondertekening van de Overeenkomst, dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van Griekenland aftrekbaar zijn bij de berekening van de winst van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt, is overeengekomen dat de twee Regeringen de genoemde bepalingen nader zullen bezien met het oogmerk letter b) aan te passen aan letter a) wanneer de grondslag van dit verschil niet langer bestaat.  

### II  

####Ad Artikelen 10, 11 en 12

Verzoeken om teruggaaf van belasting die in strijd met de bepalingen van de artikelen 10, 11 en 12 is geheven, moeten bij de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat die de belasting heeft geheven, worden ingediend binnen een tijdvak van drie jaren na het einde van het kalenderjaar waarin de belasting is geheven.  

### III  

####Ad Artikel 17

Het is wel verstaan, dat de uitdrukking „bestuurder” of „commissaris” van een Nederlands lichaam slaat op personen die als zodanig zijn benoemd door de algemene vergadering van aandeelhouders of door enig ander bevoegd orgaan van dat lichaam, en zijn belast met de algemene leiding van het lichaam, onderscheidenlijk met het toezicht daarop.
