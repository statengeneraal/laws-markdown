2.  Where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

a) an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State,   and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.  

### Article  10  

####Dividends

1.  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 the State of which the company is a resident shall not levy a tax on dividends paid by that company to a company the capital of which is wholly or partly divided into shares and which is a resident of the other State and holds directly at least 25 percent of the capital of the company paying the dividends.

7.  The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the recipient of the dividends, being a resident of one of the States, has in the other State, of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, a permanent establishment with which the holding by virtue of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
8.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company to persons who are not residents of that other State, or subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the recipient of the interest, being a resident of one of the States, has in the other State in which the interest arises a permanent establishment with which the debt-claim from which the interest arises is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
4.  Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   

### Article  12  

####Royalties

1.  Royalties arising in one of the States and paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed in that other State.

5.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the royalties, being a resident of one of the States, has in the other State in which the royalties arise a permanent establishment with which the right or property giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
6.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the States when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the States or not, has in one of the States a permanent establishment in connection with which the contract under which the royalties are paid was concluded, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   
7.  Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

Without prejudice to the application of the provisions concerning the compensation of losses in the unilateral regulations for the avoidance of double taxation the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the amount of tax computed in conformity with paragraph 1 of this Article equal to such part of that tax which bears the same proportion to the aforesaid tax, as the part of the income or capital which is included in the basis mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article and may be taxed in Czechoslovakia according to Articles 6 and 7, paragraph 7 of Article 10, paragraph 3 of Article 11, paragraph 5 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 14, Article 15, paragraph 1 of Article 16, paragraph 1 of Article 17, Article 20, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 24, of this Convention bears to the total income or capital which forms the basis mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article.

B. In the case of Czechoslovakia: 

1. Income other than that mentioned in paragraph 2 below shall be exempt from the Czechoslovak taxes, if the income according to the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in the Netherlands.

### Article  26  

####Non-discrimination

1.  The nationals of one of the States, whether they are residents of that State or not, shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.

a) all individuals possessing the nationality of one of the States;  

b) all legal persons, partnerships and associations deriving their status as such from the law in force in one of the States.     
3.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging one of the States to grant to residents of the other State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  In this Article the term „taxation” means taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  27  

####Mutual agreement procedure

2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Convention.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.

Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any persons or authorities other than those concerned with the assessment or collection of the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.   
2.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation:

### Artikel  7  

####Winst uit onderneming

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent met behulp van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent met behulp van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, worden in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - daaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.   
4.  Voor zover het in een Staat gebruikelijk was de aan een vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen te bepalen op basis van een verdeling van de totale winst van de onderneming over haar verschillende delen, belet niets in het tweede lid die Staat de te belasten voordelen te bepalen volgens de gebruikelijke verdeling; de gevolgde methode van verdeling moet echter zodanig zijn, dat het resultaat in overeenstemming is met de in dit artikel neergelegde beginselen.   
5.  Geen voordelen worden aan een vaste inrichting toegerekend enkel op grond van aankoop door die vaste inrichting van goederen of koopwaar voor de onderneming.   
6.  Voor de toepassing van de voorgaande leden worden de aan de vaste inrichting toe te rekenen voordelen van jaar tot jaar volgens dezelfde methode bepaald, tenzij er een goede en genoegzame reden bestaat om hiervan af te wijken.   
7.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetast door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8  

####Zeevaart, binnenvaart en luchtvaart

1.  Voordelen uit de exploitatie van schepen of luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
2.  Voordelen uit de exploitatie van schepen die dienen voor het vervoer in de binnenwateren zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.   
3.  Indien de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van een zeescheepvaart- of een binnenscheepvaartonderneming zich aan boord van een schip bevindt, wordt deze plaats geacht te zijn gelegen in de Staat waar de thuishaven van het schip is gelegen, of, indien er geen thuishaven is, in de Staat waarvan de exploitant van het schip inwoner is.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

Indien 

a) een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b) dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat,   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden aanvaard of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die zonder deze voorwaarden zouden zijn opgekomen aan een van de ondernemingen, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden haar niet zijn opgekomen, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast.  

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar de aldus geheven belasting mag 10 percent van het bruto-bedrag van de dividenden niet overschrijden.   
3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid mag de Staat waarvan het lichaam inwoner is, geen belasting heffen op dividenden betaald door dat lichaam aan een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk in aandelen is verdeeld en dat inwoner is van de andere Staat en onmiddellijk ten minste 25 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede en derde lid.   
5.  De bepalingen van het tweede en derde lid laten onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winsten waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
6.  De uitdrukking „dividenden”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst en inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de belastingwetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, met inkomsten uit aandelen worden gelijkgesteld.   
7.  De bepalingen van het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een vaste inrichting heeft en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In een zodanig geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing.   
8.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden betaald door het lichaam aan personen die geen inwoner zijn van die andere Staat, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet-uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11  

####Interest

1.  Interest afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, is slechts in die andere Staat belastbaar.   
2.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit overheidsleningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek, doch geen aanspraak gevende op een aandeel in de winst, en schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, alsmede alle andere inkomsten die door de belastingwetgeving van de Staat waaruit de inkomsten afkomstig zijn, met inkomsten uit geldlening worden gelijkgesteld.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is, een vaste inrichting heeft en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest verschuldigd is, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In een zodanig geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing.   
4.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan zij wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van de betaalde bedragen belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Royalty’s

1.  Royalty’s afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze royalty’s mogen echter in de Staat waaruit zij afkomstig zijn, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar de aldus geheven belasting mag 5 percent van het bedrag van de royalty's niet overschrijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De uitdrukking „royalty’s”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent vergoedingen van welke aard ook voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, een auteursrecht op een werk op het gebied van letterkunde, kunst of wetenschap - daaronder begrepen bioscoopfilms -, van een octrooi, een fabrieks- of handelsmerk, een tekening of model, een plan, een geheim recept of een geheime werkwijze, dan wel voor het gebruik van, of voor het recht van gebruik van, nijverheids- en handelsuitrusting of wetenschappelijke uitrusting, of voor inlichtingen omtrent ervaringen op het gebied van nijverheid, handel of wetenschap.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en het tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de genieter van de royalty’s, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty’s afkomstig zijn, een vaste inrichting heeft en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty’s verschuldigd zijn, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting behoort. In een zodanig geval zijn de bepalingen van artikel 7 van toepassing.   
6.  Royalty’s worden geacht uit een van de Staten afkomstig te zijn, indien zij worden betaald door die Staat zelf, door een staatkundig onderdeel, door een plaatselijk publiekrechtelijk lichaam of door een inwoner van die Staat. Indien evenwel de persoon die de royalty’s betaalt, ongeacht of hij inwoner van een van de Staten is of niet, in een van de Staten een vaste inrichting heeft waarvoor het contract op grond waarvan de royalty’s worden betaald, was gesloten, en deze royalty’s ten laste komen van die vaste inrichting, worden deze royalty’s geacht afkomstig te zijn uit de Staat waar de vaste inrichting is gelegen.   
7.  Indien, ten gevolge van een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty’s, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de schuldeiser zou zijn overeengekomen, vinden de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van de betaalde bedragen belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.   

### Artikel  13  

####Beperking van de artikelen 10, 11 en 12

Internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, alsmede personen die deel uitmaken van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat, die in een van de Staten verblijven, hebben in de andere Staat geen recht op de verminderingen of vrijstellingen van belasting voorzien in de artikelen 10, 11 en 12, met betrekking tot uit die andere Staat afkomstige bestanddelen van het inkomen die in deze artikelen zijn behandeld, indien die bestanddelen van het inkomen in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan een belasting naar het inkomen zijn onderworpen.  

### Artikel  14  

####Vermogenswinsten

1.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van onroerende goederen, zoals omschreven in artikel 6, tweede lid, mogen worden belast in de Staat waar deze goederen zijn gelegen.

3.  Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het tweede lid zijn voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen en luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd en van schepen die dienen voor het vervoer in de binnenwateren, alsmede van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen en luchtvaartuigen, slechts belastbaar in de Staat waar de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen. De bepalingen van artikel 8, derde lid, vinden hierbij toepassing.   
4.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van alle andere zaken dan die genoemd in het eerste, tweede en derde lid zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarvan de vervreemder inwoner is.   
5.  De bepalingen van het vierde lid tasten niet aan het recht van elk van de Staten om overeenkomstig zijn eigen wetgeving belasting te heffen op voordelen die voortvloeien uit de vervreemding van aandelen of winstbewijzen in een lichaam waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk in aandelen is verdeeld en dat volgens de wetgeving van die Staat inwoner is van die Staat, verkregen door een natuurlijke persoon die inwoner is van de andere Staat en die in de loop van de laatste vijf jaren voorafgaande aan de vervreemding van de aandelen of winstbewijzen inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat is geweest.

Indien hij over zulk een vast middelpunt beschikt, mogen de voordelen in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan dat vaste middelpunt kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  De uitdrukking „vrij beroep” sluit in zelfstandige werkzaamheden op het gebied van wetenschap, letterkunde, kunst, opvoeding of onderwijs, alsmede de zelfstandige werkzaamheden van artsen, advocaten, technici, architecten, tandartsen en accountants.   

### Artikel  16

Indien de dienstbetrekking aldaar wordt uitgeoefend, mag de ter zake daarvan verkregen beloning in die andere Staat worden belast.

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

### Artikel  25  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

Overeengekomen wordt dat dubbele belasting op de volgende wijze wordt vermeden: 

A. Wat betreft Nederland: 

1. Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Tsjechoslowakije mogen worden belast.  

2. Onder voorbehoud van de toepassing van de bepalingen betreffende de verliescompensatie in de eenzijdige voorschriften tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting, verleent Nederland een vermindering op het overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel berekende belastingbedrag. Deze vermindering is gelijk aan dat gedeelte van het belastingbedrag dat tot dat belastingbedrag in dezelfde verhouding staat, als het gedeelte van het inkomen of het vermogen dat in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag is begrepen en dat volgens de artikelen 6, 7, 10, zevende lid, 11, derde lid, 12, vijfde lid, 14, eerste en tweede lid, 15, 16, eerste lid, 17, eerste lid, 20 en 24, eerste en tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in Tsjechoslowakije mag worden belast, staat tot het bedrag van het gehele inkomen of vermogen dat de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag vormt.  

3. Nederland verleent voorts een vermindering op de overeenkomstig de voorgaande leden van dit artikel berekende belasting met betrekking tot de bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens de artikelen 10, tweede lid, 12, tweede lid, 14, vijfde lid en 18, in Tsjechoslowakije mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze vermindering is het laagste van de volgende bedragen: 

a) het bedrag dat gelijk is aan de in Tsjechoslowakije geheven belasting;  

b) het bedrag van de Nederlandse belasting dat tot het overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel berekende belastingbedrag in dezelfde verhouding staat, als het bedrag van de genoemde bestanddelen van het inkomen staat tot het bedrag van het inkomen dat de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde grondslag vormt.      

B. Wat betreft Tsjechoslowakije: 

1. Inkomen, met uitzondering van het in het tweede lid bedoelde inkomen, is vrijgesteld van de Tsjechoslowaakse belastingen, indien het inkomen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in Nederland mag worden belast.  

2. Met betrekking tot inkomen, bedoeld in de artikelen 10, 12, 14, 17 en 18, waarover overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze artikelen Nederlandse belasting is geheven, verleent Tsjechoslowakije aan een inwoner van Tsjechoslowakije die zodanig inkomen uit Nederland ontvangt, een verrekening van belasting, overeenkomende met het bedrag van de in Nederland geheven belasting; deze belasting wordt verrekend met de Tsjechoslowaakse belastingen, in de grondslagen waarvan dit inkomen is begrepen, tot een bedrag, dat de in Nederland over dit inkomen geheven belasting niet overschrijdt.  

3. Niettegenstaande de bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid mag de Tsjechoslowaakse belasting over inkomen, dat krachtens deze Overeenkomst in Tsjechoslowakije belastbaar is, worden berekend naar het tarief dat behoort bij het totale inkomen dat volgens de Tsjechoslowaakse wetgeving belastbaar is.      

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  26  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten, ongeacht of zij inwoner zijn van die Staat of niet, worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
2.  De uitdrukking „onderdanen” betekent: 

a) alle natuurlijke personen die de nationaliteit van een van de Staten bezitten;  

b) alle rechtspersonen, vennootschappen en verenigingen die hun rechtspositie als zodanig ontlenen aan de wetgeving die in een van de Staten van kracht is.     
3.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat heeft, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of gedeeltelijk, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere soortgelijke ondernemingen van die eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  In dit artikel ziet de uitdrukking „belastingheffing” op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  27  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een inwoner van een van de Staten van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, onverminderd de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met deze Overeenkomst, te vermijden.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarvoor in deze Overeenkomst geen voorziening is getroffen.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  28  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen zodanige inlichtingen uit (zijnde inlichtingen die deze autoriteiten geordend voorhanden hebben) als nodig zijn om uitvoering te geven aan deze Overeenkomst, in het bijzonder om fraude te voorkomen en om uitvoering te geven aan wettelijke voorzieningen tegen wetsontduiking met betrekking tot de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Elke aldus uitgewisselde inlichting wordt geheim gehouden en niet ter kennis gebracht van andere personen of autoriteiten dan die belast met de vaststelling of invordering van de belastingen die het onderwerp van deze Overeenkomst uitmaken.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid aldus uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a) maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of het gebruik van die of van de andere Staat;  

b) bijzonderheden te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn volgens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c) inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, dan wel inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  29  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaren en beambten ontlenen aan de algemene regelen van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.  

### Artikel  30  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot elk van de landen Suriname en de Nederlandse Antillen of tot beide landen, indien het desbetreffende land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop deze Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van de dag en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, daaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, wordt door de beëindiging van de Overeenkomst niet tevens de toepasselijkheid van de Overeenkomst op het land waartoe zij ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, beëindigd.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####SLOTBEPALINGEN

####Inwerkingtreding

Deze Overeenkomst treedt in werking op de dag waarop de Overeenkomstsluitende Regeringen elkaar schriftelijk hebben medegedeeld, dat de Overeenkomst overeenkomstig hun onderscheiden grondwettelijke voorschriften is goedgekeurd en haar bepalingen vinden toepassing:
