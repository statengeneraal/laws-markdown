If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. It is understood, however, that the mere fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as costsharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in the preceding sentence.     
2.  Where one of the States includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.

7.  Where a company which is a resident of one of the States derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

### CHAPTER  V  

####ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

### Article  24  

####Elimination of double taxation

1.  The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income or capital which, according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the Hungarian People's Republic.   
2.  However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income or owns items of capital which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 6 of Article 10, paragraph 4 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 en 2 of Article 13, Article 14, paragraph 1 of Article 15, Article 16, paragraph 3 of Article 18, Article 19, paragraph 2 of Article 22 and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 23 of this Convention may be taxed in the Hungarian People's Republic and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income or capital by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income or capital shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income or capital which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
3.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 13, Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18 of this Convention may be taxed in the Hungarian People's Republic to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in the Hungarian People's Republic on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraphs 3 b) and 4 of Article 2, other than taxes on capital, shall be considered taxes on income.   
4.  In the case of the Hungarian People's Republic double taxation shall be avoided as follows: 

a) Where a resident of the Hungarian People's Republic derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention may be taxed in the Netherlands, the Hungarian People's Republic shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax.  

b) Where a resident of the Hungarian People's Republic derives items of income which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, may be taxed in the Netherlands, the Hungarian People's Republic shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the Netherlands. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given which is attributable to such items of income derived from the Netherlands.  

c) Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of the Hungarian People's Republic is exempt from tax in the Hungarian People's Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital.

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  25  

####Non-discrimination

1.  Nationals of one of the States shall not be subjected in the other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the States.   
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provisions shall not be construed as obliging one of the States to grant to residents of the other State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 5 of Article 11, or paragraph 5 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
4.  Enterprises of one of the States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
5.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.   

### Article  26  

####Mutual agreement procedure

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 25, to that of the State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   

### Article  27  

####Exchange of information

1.  The competent authorities of the States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention.

Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purpose. The information received will be treated as secret on request of the State giving the information.   
2.  In no case the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on one of the States the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or administrative practice of that or of the other State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).     

### Article  28  

####Diplomatic agents and consular officers

1.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.   
2.  For the purposes of the Convention an individual, who is a member of a diplomatic or consular mission of one of the States in the other State or in a third State and who is a national of the sending State, shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending State if he is submitted therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income and on capital as are residents of that State.   
3.  The Convention shall not apply to international organisations, organs and officials thereof and members of a diplomatic or consular mission of a third State, being present in one of the States, if they are not subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income or on capital as are residents of that State.   

### Article  29  

####Territorial extension

1.  This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to either or both of the countries of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles, if the country concerned imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.   
2.  Unless otherwise agreed the termination of the Convention shall not also terminate any extension of the Convention to any country to which it has been extended under this Article.

1.  De voordelen van een onderneming van een van de Staten zijn slechts in die Staat belastbaar, tenzij de onderneming in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting. Indien de onderneming aldus haar bedrijf uitoefent, mogen de voordelen van de onderneming in de andere Staat worden belast, maar slechts in zoverre als zij aan die vaste inrichting kunnen worden toegerekend.   
2.  Onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van het derde lid worden, indien een onderneming van een van de Staten in de andere Staat haar bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, in elk van de Staten aan die vaste inrichting de voordelen toegerekend die zij geacht zou kunnen worden te behalen, indien zij een zelfstandige onderneming zou zijn die dezelfde of soortgelijke werkzaamheden zou uitoefenen onder dezelfde of soortgelijke omstandigheden en die geheel onafhankelijk transacties zou aangaan met de onderneming waarvan zij een vaste inrichting is.   
3.  Bij het bepalen van de voordelen van een vaste inrichting worden in aftrek toegelaten kosten - waaronder begrepen kosten van de leiding en algemene beheerskosten - die ten behoeve van de vaste inrichting zijn gemaakt, hetzij in de Staat waarin de vaste inrichting is gevestigd, hetzij elders.

6.  Indien in de voordelen bestanddelen zijn begrepen die afzonderlijk in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden behandeld, worden de bepalingen van die artikelen niet aangetatst door de bepalingen van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  8

3.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel omvatten voordelen behaald met de exploitatie van schepen, binnenschepen en luchtvaartuigen in internationaal verkeer mede voordelen behaald met de verhuur op basis van verhuur zonder bemanning van schepen, binnenschepen en luchtvaartuigen indien deze in het internationale verkeer worden geëxploiteerd, voor zover deze voordelen voortvloeien uit de voordelen omschreven in het eerste lid.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn ook van toepassing op voordelen uit de deelneming in een „pool”, een gemeenschappelijke onderneming of een internationaal opererend agentschap.   

### Artikel  9  

####Gelieerde ondernemingen

1.  Indien 

a) een onderneming van een van de Staten onmiddellijk of middellijk deelneemt aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van de andere Staat, of  

b) dezelfde personen onmiddellijk of middellijk deelnemen aan de leiding van, aan het toezicht op dan wel in het kapitaal van een onderneming van een van de Staten en een onderneming van de andere Staat,   en in het ene of in het andere geval tussen de beide ondernemingen in hun handelsbetrekkingen of financiële betrekkingen voorwaarden worden overeengekomen of opgelegd, die afwijken van die welke zouden worden overeengekomen tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen, mogen alle voordelen die een van de ondernemingen zonder deze voorwaarden zou hebben behaald, maar ten gevolge van die voorwaarden niet heeft behaald, worden begrepen in de voordelen van die onderneming en dienovereenkomstig worden belast. Het is echter wel verstaan, dat de enkele omstandigheid dat gelieerde ondernemingen overeenkomsten hebben afgesloten, zoals „costsharing” overeenkomsten of algemene dienstverleningsovereenkomsten, voor of gebaseerd op de toerekening van de kosten van de leiding, de algemene beheerskosten, de technische en zakelijke kosten, kosten voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling en andere soortgelijke kosten, op zichzelf geen voorwaarde is als bedoeld in de voorgaande zin.   
2.  Indien een van de Staten in de voordelen van een onderneming van die Staat voordelen begrijpt - en dienovereenkomstig belast - ter zake waarvan een onderneming van de andere Staat in die andere Staat in de belastingheffing is betrokken en deze voordelen bestaan uit voordelen welke de onderneming van de eerstbedoelde Staat zou hebben behaald indien tussen de beide ondernemingen zodanige voorwaarden zouden zijn overeengekomen als die welke tussen onafhankelijke ondernemingen zouden zijn overeengekomen, zal die andere Staat het bedrag aan belasting dat in die Staat over die voordelen is geheven, dienovereenkomstig aanpassen. Bij de vaststelling van deze aanpassing wordt rekening gehouden met de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en plegen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten zo nodig met elkaar overleg.   

### Artikel  10  

####Dividenden

1.  Dividenden betaald door een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, mogen in die andere Staat worden belast.   
2.  Deze dividenden mogen echter ook in de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Staat worden belast, maar indien de genieter de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden is, mag de aldus geheven belasting niet overschrijden: 

a) 5 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde een lichaam (niet zijnde een maatschap of een vennootschap onder firma) is dat onmiddellijk ten minste 25 percent bezit van het kapitaal van het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt;  

b) 15 percent van het brutobedrag van de dividenden in alle andere gevallen.     
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten regelen in onderlinge overeenstemming de wijze van toepassing van het tweede lid.   
4.  De bepalingen van het tweede lid laten onverlet de belastingheffing van het lichaam ter zake van de winst waaruit de dividenden worden betaald.   
5.  De uitdrukking „dividenden”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit aandelen, winstaandelen of winstbewijzen, mijnaandelen, oprichtersaandelen of andere rechten, die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst, alsmede inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen die aanspraak geven op een aandeel in de winst en inkomsten uit andere vennootschappelijke rechten die door de wetgeving van de Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de uitdeling doet inwoner is, op dezelfde wijze aan de belastingheffing worden onderworpen als inkomsten uit aandelen.   
6.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de dividenden, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waarvan het lichaam dat de dividenden betaalt inwoner is, een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
7.  Indien een lichaam dat inwoner is van een van de Staten, voordelen of inkomsten verkrijgt uit de andere Staat, mag die andere Staat geen belasting heffen op de dividenden die door het lichaam worden betaald, behalve voor zover deze dividenden worden betaald aan een inwoner van die andere Staat of voor zover het aandelenbezit uit hoofde waarvan de dividenden worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van een in die andere Staat gevestigde vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt behoort, noch de niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam onderwerpen aan een belasting op niet-uitgedeelde winst van het lichaam, zelfs indien de betaalde dividenden of de niet uitgedeelde winst geheel of gedeeltelijk bestaan uit voordelen of inkomsten die uit die andere Staat afkomstig zijn.   

### Artikel  11

3.  De uitdrukking „interest”, zoals gebezigd in dit artikel, betekent inkomsten uit schuldvorderingen van welke aard ook, al dan niet verzekerd door hypotheek, doch niet aanspraak gevend op een aandeel in de winst van de schuldenaar, en in het bijzonder inkomsten uit overheidsleningen en inkomsten uit obligaties of schuldbewijzen, waaronder begrepen de aan zodanige leningen, obligaties of schuldbewijzen verbonden premies en prijzen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de interest, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de interest afkomstig is een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en de vordering uit hoofde waarvan de interest wordt betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang van het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
5.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde interest, gelet op de schuldvordering ter zake waarvan deze wordt betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.

####Royalty's

1.  Royalty's afkomstig uit een van de Staten en betaald aan een inwoner van de andere Staat zijn slechts in die andere Staat belastbaar indien die inwoner de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's is.

4.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid zijn niet van toepassing, indien de uiteindelijk gerechtigde tot de royalty's, die inwoner is van een van de Staten, in de andere Staat waaruit de royalty's afkomstig zijn een bedrijf uitoefent door middel van een aldaar gevestigde vaste inrichting, of in die andere Staat zelfstandige arbeid verricht vanuit een aldaar gevestigd vast middelpunt, en het recht of de zaak uit hoofde waarvan de royalty's worden betaald, tot het bedrijfsvermogen van die vaste inrichting of tot het beroepsvermogen van dat vaste middelpunt behoort. In dat geval zijn, naar gelang het geval, de bepalingen van artikel 7 of artikel 14 van toepassing.   
5.  Indien, wegens een bijzondere verhouding tussen de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde of tussen hen beiden en een derde, het bedrag van de betaalde royalty's, gelet op het gebruik, het recht of de inlichtingen waarvoor zij worden betaald, hoger is dan het bedrag dat zonder zulk een verhouding door de schuldenaar en de uiteindelijk gerechtigde zou zijn overeengekomen, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel slechts op het laatstbedoelde bedrag van toepassing. In dat geval blijft het daarboven uitgaande deel van het betaalde bedrag belastbaar overeenkomstig de wetgeving van elk van de Staten, zulks met inachtneming van de overige bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.

3.  Voordelen verkregen uit de vervreemding van schepen, binnenschepen of luchtvaartuigen die in internationaal verkeer worden geëxploiteerd of van roerende zaken die worden gebruikt bij de exploitatie van deze schepen, binnenschepen, of luchtvaartuigen, zijn slechts belastbaar in de Staat waarin de plaats van de werkelijke leiding van de onderneming is gelegen.

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####VERMIJDING VAN DUBBELE BELASTING

### Artikel  24  

####Vermijding van dubbele belasting

1.  Nederland is bevoegd bij het heffen van belasting van zijn inwoners in de grondslag waarnaar de belasting wordt geheven, de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen te begrijpen die overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek mogen worden belast.   
2.  Indien echter een inwoner van Nederland bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt of vermogensbestanddelen bezit die volgens artikel 6, artikel 7, artikel 10, zesde lid, artikel 11, vierde lid, artikel 12, vierde lid, artikel 13, eerste en tweede lid, artikel 14, artikel 15, eerste lid, artikel 16, artikel 18, derde lid, artikel 19, artikel 22, tweede lid, en artikel 23, eerste en tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek mogen worden belast en die in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen, stelt Nederland deze inkomens- en vermogensbestanddelen vrij door een vermindering van zijn belasting toe te staan. Deze vermindering wordt berekend overeenkomstig de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting. Te dien einde worden genoemde bestanddelen geacht te zijn begrepen in het totale bedrag van de bestanddelen van het inkomen of het vermogen die ingevolge die bepalingen van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld.   
3.  Nederland verleent voorts een aftrek op de aldus berekende Nederlandse belasting voor die bestanddelen van het inkomen die volgens artikel 10, tweede lid, artikel 13, vijfde lid, artikel 17 en artikel 18, tweede lid, van deze Overeenkomst in de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek mogen worden belast, in zoverre deze bestanddelen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde grondslag zijn begrepen. Het bedrag van deze aftrek is gelijk aan de in de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek over deze bestanddelen van het inkomen betaalde belasting, maar bedraagt niet meer dan het bedrag van de vermindering die zou zijn verleend indien de aldus in het inkomen begrepen bestanddelen van het inkomen de enige bestanddelen van het inkomen zouden zijn geweest die uit hoofde van de bepalingen in de Nederlandse wetgeving tot het vermijden van dubbele belasting van Nederlandse belasting zijn vrijgesteld. Voor de toepassing van dit lid worden de belastingen als bedoeld in artikel 2, derde lid onder b) en vierde lid, niet zijnde belastingen naar het vermogen, beschouwd als belastingen naar het inkomen.   
4.  Wat betreft de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek wordt dubbele belasting als volgt vermeden: 

a) Indien een inwoner van de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek voordelen en inkomsten verkrijgt of vermogensbestanddelen bezit die volgens de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst in Nederland mogen worden belast, stelt de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek, onder voorbehoud van de bepalingen van de letters b) en c), die voordelen en inkomsten of die vermogensbestanddelen vrij van belasting.  

b) Indien een inwoner van de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek bestanddelen van het inkomen verkrijgt die, volgens de bepalingen van artikel 10 in Nederland mogen worden belast, staat de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek een vermindering toe op de belasting naar het inkomen van die inwoner tot een bedrag gelijk aan de in Nederland betaalde belasting. Deze vermindering overschrijdt echter niet dat deel van de belasting, zoals deze is berekend vóór het verlenen van de vermindering, dat kan worden toegerekend aan die bestanddelen van het inkomen die zijn verkregen uit Nederland.  

c) Indien voordelen en inkomsten verkregen door of vermogensbestanddelen bezeten door een inwoner van de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek volgens een bepaling van de Overeenkomst zijn vrijgesteld van belasting in de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek, mag de Hongaarse Volksrepubliek niettemin bij het berekenen van het belastingbedrag over de overige voordelen en inkomsten of vermogensbestanddelen van die inwoner, rekening houden met de vrijgestelde voordelen en inkomsten of vermogensbestanddelen.     

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####BIJZONDERE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  25  

####Non-discriminatie

1.  Onderdanen van een van de Staten worden in de andere Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die anders of zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan onderdanen van die andere Staat onder dezelfde omstandigheden zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen. Deze bepaling is, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in artikel 1, ook van toepassing op personen die geen inwoners zijn van een van de Staten of van beide Staten.   
2.  De belastingheffing van een vaste inrichting die een onderneming van een van de Staten heeft in de andere Staat, is in die andere Staat niet ongunstiger dan de belastingheffing van ondernemingen van die andere Staat die dezelfde werkzaamheden uitoefenen. Deze bepaling mag niet aldus worden uitgelegd, dat zij een van de Staten verplicht aan inwoners van de andere Staat bij de belastingheffing de persoonlijke aftrekken, tegemoetkomingen en verminderingen uit hoofde van de samenstelling van het gezin of gezinslasten te verlenen, die eerstbedoelde Staat aan zijn eigen inwoners verleent.   
3.  Behalve indien de bepalingen van artikel 9, eerste lid, artikel 11, vijfde lid, of artikel 12, vijfde lid, van toepassing zijn, zijn interest, royalty's en andere uitgaven, betaald door een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat, bij de vaststelling van de belastbare winst van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij betaald waren aan een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat. Zo ook zijn alle schulden van een onderneming van een van de Staten aan een inwoner van de andere Staat bij de vaststelling van het belastbare vermogen van die onderneming onder dezelfde voorwaarden aftrekbaar als wanneer zij waren aangegaan met een inwoner van de eerstbedoelde Staat.   
4.  Ondernemingen van een van de Staten, waarvan het kapitaal geheel of ten dele, onmiddellijk of middellijk, in het bezit is van of wordt beheerst door een of meer inwoners van de andere Staat, worden in de eerstbedoelde Staat niet aan enige belastingheffing of daarmede verband houdende verplichting onderworpen, die zwaarder is dan de belastingheffing en daarmede verband houdende verplichtingen, waaraan andere, soortgelijke ondernemingen van de eerstbedoelde Staat zijn of kunnen worden onderworpen.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit artikel zijn, niettegenstaande de bepalingen van artikel 2, van toepassing op belastingen van elke soort en benaming.   

### Artikel  26  

####Regeling voor onderling overleg

1.  Indien een persoon van oordeel is dat de maatregelen van een van de Staten of van beide Staten voor hem leiden of zullen leiden tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, kan hij, ongeacht de rechtsmiddelen waarin de nationale wetgeving van die Staten voorziet, zijn geval voorleggen aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Staat waarvan hij inwoner is, of, indien zijn geval valt onder artikel 25, eerste lid, aan die van de Staat waarvan hij onderdaan is. Het geval moet worden voorgelegd binnen drie jaar nadat de maatregel die leidt tot een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van de Overeenkomst, voor het eerst ter kennis is gebracht.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteit tracht, indien het bezwaar haar gegrond voorkomt en indien zij niet zelf in staat is tot een bevredigende oplossing te komen, de aangelegenheid in onderlinge overeenstemming met de bevoegde autoriteit van de andere Staat te regelen ten einde een belastingheffing die niet in overeenstemming is met de Overeenkomst, te vermijden. De overeengekomen regeling wordt uitgevoerd niettegenstaande de verjaringstermijnen in de nationale wetgeving van de Staten.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten trachten moeilijkheden of twijfelpunten die mochten rijzen met betrekking tot de uitlegging of de toepassing van de Overeenkomst in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen. Zij kunnen ook met elkaar overleg plegen ten einde dubbele belasting ongedaan te maken in gevallen waarin de Overeenkomst niet voorziet.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten kunnen zich rechtstreeks met elkaar in verbinding stellen ten einde een overeenstemming als bedoeld in de voorgaande leden te bereiken.   

### Artikel  27  

####Uitwisseling van inlichtingen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Staten wisselen die inlichtingen uit die nodig zijn voor de uitvoering van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst. Alle door een van de Staten ontvangen inlichtingen worden op dezelfde wijze geheim gehouden als inlichtingen die volgens de nationale wetgeving van die Staat zijn verkregen en worden alleen ter kennis gebracht van personen of autoriteiten (waaronder begrepen rechterlijke instanties, administratiefrechtelijke instanties en administratiefrechtelijke lichamen) die betrokken zijn bij de vaststelling of invordering van, de tenuitvoerlegging ter zake van, of de beslissing in beroepszaken betrekking hebbende op de belastingen waarop de Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Deze personen of autoriteiten mogen van de inlichtingen alleen voor deze doeleinden gebruik maken. De ontvangen inlichtingen worden geheim gehouden op verzoek van de Staat die de inlichtingen verstrekt.   
2.  In geen geval worden de bepalingen van het eerste lid zo uitgelegd dat zij een van de Staten de verplichting opleggen: 

a) administratieve maatregelen te nemen die in strijd zijn met de wetgeving of de administratieve praktijk van die of van de andere Staat;  

b) inlichtingen te verstrekken die niet verkrijgbaar zijn krachtens de wetgeving of in de normale gang van zaken in de administratie van die of van de andere Staat;  

c) inlichtingen te verstrekken die een handels-, bedrijfs-, nijverheids-, of beroepsgeheim of een fabrieks- of handelswerkwijze zouden onthullen, of inlichtingen waarvan het verstrekken in strijd zou zijn met de openbare orde.     

### Artikel  28  

####Diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren

1.  De bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tasten in geen enkel opzicht de fiscale voorrechten aan die diplomatieke en consulaire ambtenaren ontlenen aan de algemene regels van het volkenrecht of aan de bepalingen van bijzondere overeenkomsten.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van de Overeenkomst wordt een natuurlijke persoon die deel uitmaakt van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een van de Staten in de andere Staat of in een derde Staat en die onderdaan is van de zendstaat, geacht inwoner van de zendstaat te zijn, indien hij daarin aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen en het vermogen is onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   
3.  De Overeenkomst is niet van toepassing op internationale organisaties, hun organen en functionarissen, noch op leden van een diplomatieke of consulaire vertegenwoordiging van een derde Staat die in een van de Staten verblijven, indien zij in die Staat niet aan dezelfde verplichtingen ter zake van belastingen naar het inkomen of naar het vermogen zijn onderworpen als inwoners van die Staat.   

### Artikel  29  

####Uitbreiding tot andere gebieden

1.  Deze Overeenkomst kan, hetzij in haar geheel, hetzij met de noodzakelijke wijzigingen, worden uitgebreid tot Aruba en/of de Nederlandse Antillen indien het betreffende land belastingen heft die in wezen gelijksoortig zijn aan de belastingen waarop de Overeenkomst van toepassing is. Zulk een uitbreiding wordt van kracht met ingang van een datum en met inachtneming van wijzigingen en voorwaarden, waaronder begrepen voorwaarden ten aanzien van de beëindiging, nader vast te stellen en overeen te komen bij diplomatieke notawisseling.   
2.  Tenzij anders is overeengekomen, brengt de beëindiging van de Overeenkomst niet met zich mede, dat tevens de uitbreiding van de Overeenkomst tot enig land waartoe zij ingevolge dit artikel is uitgebreid, wordt beëindigd.
