2.  De President van het Hof kan, in het belang van een goede rechtsbedeling, elke Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die geen partij bij de procedure is of elke belanghebbende die niet de verzoeker is, uitnodigen schriftelijke conclusies in te dienen of aan zittingen deel te nemen.   
3.  In alle zaken die voor een Kamer of de Grote Kamer aanhangig zijn, kan de Commissaris voor de Mensenrechten van de Raad van Europa schriftelijke conclusies indienen en aan hoorzittingen deelnemen.

1.  Het Hof kan in elk stadium van de procedure beslissen een verzoekschrift van de rol te schrappen wanneer de omstandigheden tot de conclusie leiden dat 

a. de verzoeker niet voornemens is zijn verzoekschrift te handhaven; of  

b. het geschil is opgelost; of  

c. het om een andere door het Hof vastgestelde reden niet meer gerechtvaardigd is de behandeling van het verzoekschrift voort te zetten.   Het Hof zet de behandeling van het verzoekschrift evenwel voort, indien de eerbiediging van de in het Verdrag en de Protocollen daarbij omschreven rechten van de mens zulks vereist.
