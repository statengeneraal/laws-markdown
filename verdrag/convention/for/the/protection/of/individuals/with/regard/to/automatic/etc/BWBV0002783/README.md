####Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data

Preamble  

The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity between its members, based in particular on respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights and fundamental freedoms; Considering that it is desirable to extend the safeguards for everyone's rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular the right to the respect for privacy, taking account of the increasing flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing automatic processing; Reaffirming at the same time their commitment to freedom of information regardless of frontiers; Recognising that it is necessary to reconcile the fundamental values of the respect for privacy and the free flow of information between peoples, Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  1  

####Object and purpose

The purpose of this convention is to secure in the territory of each Party for every individual, whatever his nationality or residence, respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data relating to him ("data protection").  

### Article  2  

####Definitions

For the purposes of this convention: 

a. "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual ("data subject");  

b. "automated data file" means any set of data undergoing automatic processing;  

c. "automatic processing" includes the following operations if carried out in whole or in part by automated means: storage of data, carrying out of logical and/or arithmetical operations on those data, their alteration, erasure, retrieval or dissemination;  

d. "controller of the file" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body who is competent according to the national law to decide what should be the purpose of the automated data file, which categories of personal data should be stored and which operations should be applied to them.    

### Article  3  

####Scope

1.  The Parties undertake to apply this convention to automated personal data files and automatic processing of personal data in the public and private sectors.   
2.  Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any later time, give notice by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe: 

a. that it will not apply this convention to certain categories of automated personal data files, a list of which will be deposited. In this list it shall not include, however, categories of automated data files subject under its domestic law to data protection provisions. Consequently, it shall amend this list by a new declaration whenever additional categories of automated personal data files are subjected to data protection provisions under its domestic law;  

b. that it will also apply this convention to information relating to groups of persons, associations, foundations, companies, corporations and any other bodies consisting directly or indirectly of individuals, whether or not such bodies possess legal personality;

4.  Any Party which has excluded certain categories of automated personal data files by a declaration provided for in sub-paragraph 2.a above may not claim the application of this convention to such categories by a Party which has not excluded them.   
5.  Likewise, a Party which has not made one or other of the extensions provided for in sub-paragraphs 2.b and c above may not claim the application of this convention on these points with respect to a Party which has made such extensions.   
6.  The declarations provided for in paragraph 2 above shall take effect from the moment of the entry into force of the convention with regard to the State which has made them if they have been made at the time of signature or deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or three months after their receipt by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe if they have been made at any later time.

####Verplichtingen van Partijen

1.  Elke Partij treft in zijn interne recht de noodzakelijke maatregelen om uitvoering te geven aan de grondbeginselen van gegevensbescherming, vervat in dit hoofdstuk.   
2.  Deze maatregelen dienen te zijn getroffen uiterlijk op het tijdstip waarop dit Verdrag ten aanzien van die Partij in werking treedt.   

### Artikel  5

Persoonsgegevens die langs geautomatiseerde weg worden verwerkt, dienen: 

a. op eerlijke en rechtmatige wijze te worden verkregen en verwerkt;  

b. te worden opgeslagen voor bepaalde en legitieme doeleinden en niet te worden gebruikt op een wijze die onverenigbaar is met die doeleinden;

### Artikel  6  

####Bijzondere categorieën gegevens

Persoonsgegevens waaruit ras, politieke overtuiging, godsdienstige of andere levensbeschouwing blijkt, alsmede die welke betrekking hebben op gezondheid of seksueel gedrag, mogen niet langs geautomatiseerde weg worden verwerkt, tenzij het interne recht passende waarborgen ter zake biedt. Hetzelfde geldt voor persoonsgegevens over strafrechtelijke veroordelingen.  

### Artikel  7  

####Beveiliging van gegevens

Er dienen passende beveiligingsmaatregelen te worden getroffen om persoonsgegevens opgeslagen in geautomatiseerde bestanden te beschermen tegen toevallige of ongeoorloofde vernietiging, toevallig verlies en ongeoorloofde toegang, wijziging of verspreiding.  

### Artikel  8  

####Bijkomende waarborgen voor de betrokkene

Een ieder dient in staat te worden gesteld: 

a. kennis te nemen van het bestaan van een geautomatiseerd bestand van persoonsgegevens, de voornaamste doeleinden hiervan, alsmede de identiteit en de gewone verblijfplaats of de hoofdvestiging van de houder van het bestand;

d. over een rechtsmiddel te beschikken, indien geen gevolg wordt gegeven aan een verzoek om uitsluitsel of, al naargelang het geval, mededeling, verbetering of uitwissing van persoonsgegevens als bedoeld in letter b en letter c van dit artikel.    

### Artikel  9  

####Uitzonderingen en beperkingen

1.  Op het in de artikelen 5, 6 en 8 van dit Verdrag bepaalde is geen uitzondering toegestaan, tenzij binnen de in dit artikel gestelde grenzen.   
2.  Van het in de artikelen 5, 6 en 8 van dit Verdrag bepaalde kan worden afgeweken, indien de wet van de Partij in een dergelijke afwijking voorziet en het hier een maatregel betreft die in een democratische samenleving noodzakelijk is ten behoeve van: 

a. de bescherming van de veiligheid van de Staat, de openbare veiligheid, de geldelijke belangen van de Staat of de bestrijding van strafbare feiten;  

b. de bescherming van de betrokkene en van de rechten en vrijheden van anderen.     
3.  Aan de uitoefening van de in letters b, c en d van artikel 8 opgesomde rechten mogen bij de wet beperkingen worden gesteld wat betreft geautomatiseerde bestanden van persoonsgegevens die worden gebruikt voor statistiek of voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek, indien er kennelijk geen risico bestaat dat inbreuk zal worden gemaakt op de persoonlijke levenssfeer van de betrokkenen.   

### Artikel  10

Elke Partij verbindt zich passende sancties en rechtsmiddelen in te stellen ter zake van schending van bepalingen van het interne recht waarmede uitvoering wordt gegeven aan de grondbeginselen van gegevensbescherming, vervat in dit hoofdstuk.  

### Artikel  11  

####Verdergaande bescherming

Geen der bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk mag worden uitgelegd in de zin van een beperking of aantasting van de bevoegdheid van iedere Partij om aan betrokkenen een verdergaande bescherming te bieden dan bij dit Verdrag is bepaald.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####GRENSOVERSCHRIJDEND VERKEER VAN GEGEVENS

### Artikel  12  

####Grensoverschrijdend verkeer van persoonsgegevens en intern recht

1.  De volgende bepalingen gelden voor het overbrengen over de landsgrenzen, met welk middel dan ook, van persoonsgegevens die langs geautomatiseerde weg worden verwerkt of die zijn verzameld met het doel deze een zodanige verwerking te doen ondergaan.   
2.  Een Partij mag niet louter om wille van de bescherming van de persoonlijke levenssfeer het grensoverschrijdende verkeer van persoonsgegevens van haar grondgebied naar dat van een andere Partij verbieden of aan een speciale vergunning onderwerpen.   
3.  Niettemin mag een Partij van het bepaalde in het tweede lid afwijken: 

a. voor zover haar wetgeving een specifieke regeling voor bepaalde categorieën persoonsgegevens of geautomatiseerde bestanden van persoonsgegevens bevat uit hoofde van de aard van die gegevens of die bestanden, behalve wanneer de voorschriften van de andere Partij een gelijkwaardige bescherming bieden;  

b. wanneer de overbrenging van haar grondgebied naar dat van een niet-verdragsluitende Staat plaatsvindt via het grondgebied van een andere Partij, ten einde te voorkomen dat zulke overbrengingen zouden leiden tot het omzeilen van de wetgeving van de aan het begin van dit lid bedoelde Partij.
