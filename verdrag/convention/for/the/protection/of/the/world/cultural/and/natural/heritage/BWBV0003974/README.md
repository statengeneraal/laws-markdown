##Overeenkomst inzake de bescherming van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van de wereld

####Convention for the protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage

The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization meeting in Paris from 17 October to 21 November 1972 at its seventeenth session, Noting that the cultural heritage and the natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions which aggravate the situation with even more formidable phenomena of damage or destruction, Considering that deterioration or disappearance of any item of the cultural or natural heritage constitutes a harmful impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world, Considering that protection of this heritage at the national level often remains incomplete because of the scale of the resources which it requires and of the insufficient economic, scientific and technical resources of the country where the property to be protected is situated, Recalling that the Constitution of the Organization provides that it will maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge, by assuring the conservation and protection of the world's heritage, and recommending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions, Considering that the existing international conventions, recommendations and resolutions concerning cultural and natural property demonstrate the importance, for all the peoples of the world, of safeguarding this unique irreplaceable property, to whatever people it may belong, Considering that parts of the cultural or natural heritage are of outstanding interest and therefore need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole, Considering that, in view of the magnitude and gravity of the new dangers threatening them, it is incumbent on the international community as a whole to participate in the protection of the cultural and natural heritage of outstanding universal value, by the granting of collective assistance which, although not taking the place of action by the State concerned, will serve as an effective complement thereto, Considering that it is essential for this purpose to adopt new provisions in the form of a convention establishing an effective system of collective protection of the cultural and natural heritage of outstanding universal value, organized on a permanent basis and in accordance with modern scientific methods, Having decided, at its sixteenth session, that this question should be made the subject of an international convention,   Adopts this sixteenth day of November 1972 this Convention.

1.  Every State Party to this Convention shall, in so far as possible, submit to the World Heritage Committee an inventory of property forming part of the cultural and natural heritage, situated in its territory and suitable for inclusion in the list provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article. This inventory, which shall not be considered exhaustive, shall include documentation about the location of the property in question and its significance.

On the basis of the inventories submitted by States in accordance with paragraph 1, the Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, under the title of “World Heritage List”, a list of properties forming part of the cultural heritage and natural heritage, as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of this Convention, which it considers as having outstanding universal value in terms of such criteria as it shall have established. An updated list shall be distributed at least every two years.   
3.  The inclusion of a property in the World Heritage List requires the consent of the State concerned.

The Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, whenever circumstances shall so require, under the title of “List of World Heritage in Danger”, a list of the property appearing in the World Heritage List for the conservation of which major operations are necessary and for which assistance has been requested under this Convention. This list shall contain an estimate of the cost of such operations. The list may include only such property forming part of the cultural and natural heritage as is threatened by serious and specific dangers, such as the threat of disappearance caused by accelerated deterioration, large-scale public or private projects or rapid urban or tourist development projects; destruction caused by changes in the use or ownership of the land; major alterations due to unknown causes; abandonment for any reason whatsoever; the outbreak or the threat of an armed conflict; calamities and cataclysms; serious fires, earthquakes, landslides; volcanic eruptions; changes in water level, floods, and tidal waves.

7.  The Committee shall, with the agreement of the States concerned, co-ordinate and encourage the studies and research needed for the drawing up of the lists referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of this article.

### Article  13  

1.  The World Heritage Committee shall receive and study requests for international assistance formulated by States Parties to this Convention with respect to property forming part of the cultural or natural heritage, situated in their territories, and included or potentially suitable for inclusion in the lists referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11.

####Overeenkomst inzake de bescherming van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van de wereld

De Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur, bijeengekomen in haar zeventiende zitting, van 17 oktober tot 21 november 1972 te Parijs gehouden, Constaterende dat het cultureel erfgoed en het natuurlijk erfgoed in toenemende mate worden bedreigd, niet slechts door de normale oorzaken van verval, maar bovendien door de veranderingen in het maatschappelijk en economisch leven die de situatie verergeren door het veroorzaken van nog ernstiger schade of vernietiging, Overwegende dat de achteruitgang of verdwijning van elk onderdeel van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed een rampzalige verarming betekent van het erfgoed van alle volken ter wereld, Overwegende dat de bescherming van dit erfgoed op nationaal niveau vaak onvolledig blijft, omdat daarvoor middelen op grote schaal nodig zijn en de economische, wetenschappelijke en technische hulpbronnen van het land, waarin het te beschermen goed zich bevindt, te kort schieten, In herinnering brengende dat het Statuut van de Organisatie voorschrijft dat zij kennis zal bewaren, vermeerderen en verspreiden door het behoud en de bescherming te verzekeren van het erfgoed der wereld en door aan de betrokken volken de daartoe nodige internationale overeenkomsten aan te bevelen; Overwegende dat de bestaande internationale overeenkomsten, aanbevelingen en resoluties ten aanzien van culturele en natuurlijke goederen het belang aantonen dat alle volken der wereld hebben bij de bescherming van die unieke en onvervangbare goederen, aan welk volk zij ook mogen toebehoren, Overwegende dat sommige delen van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van uitzonderlijk belang zijn, hetgeen hun behoud als onderdeel van het erfgoed der gehele mensheid noodzakelijk maakt, Overwegende dat, gezien de omvang en de ernst van de nieuwe gevaren die hen bedreigen, het de taak is van de gehele internationale gemeenschap deel te nemen aan de bescherming van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van uitzonderlijke en universele waarde door het verlenen van gezamenlijke bijstand die, zonder in de plaats te treden van het optreden van de betrokken Staat, dit optreden op doeltreffende wijze aanvult, Overwegende dat het onmisbaar is daartoe nieuwe voorzieningen te treffen in de vorm van een overeenkomst tot instelling van een doeltreffend systeem voor de collectieve bescherming van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van uitzonderlijke universele waarde, op een permanente basis en volgens moderne wetenschappelijke methoden, Besloten hebbende tijdens haar zestiende zitting dat dit vraagstuk het onderwerp dient te vormen van een internationale overeenkomst,   Neemt op 16 november 1972 deze Overeenkomst aan.

Hij dient zich daartoe tot het uiterste in te spannen voor zover zijn eigen hulpbronnen dat toelaten en, waar zulks ter zake dienende is, met gebruikmaking van internationale bijstand en samenwerking, welke hij zou kunnen verkrijgen, in het bijzonder op financieel, artistiek, wetenschappelijk en technisch gebied.  

### Artikel  5  

Ten einde te waarborgen dat doeltreffende en daadwerkelijke maatregelen worden genomen voor de bescherming, het behoud en het toegankelijk maken van het op zijn grondgebied gelegen cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed dient elke Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst zoveel mogelijk en voor zover de situatie in het land zulks toelaat te streven naar: 

(a) het vaststellen van een algemeen beleid, gericht op het aan het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed geven van een functie in het leven van de gemeenschap, en naar het integreren van de bescherming van dat erfgoed in de programma's voor algemene planning;  

(b) het instellen op zijn grondgebied van een of meer diensten - voorzover zij nog niet bestaan - voor de bescherming, het behoud en het toegankelijk maken van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed, voorzien van deskundig personeel en beschikkende over de middelen ter uitvoering van hun taak;  

(c) het doen verrichten van wetenschappelijke en technische studies en research en het doen uitwerken van de operationele methoden die de Staat in staat zullen stellen het hoofd te bieden aan gevaren die zijn cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed bedreigen;

2.  In overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst nemen de Staten die daarbij partij zijn op zich hulp te bieden bij de identificatie, de bescherming, het behoud en het toegankelijk maken van het in het tweede en vierde lid van artikel 11 bedoelde cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed, indien de Staat op wiens grondgebied het is gelegen, zulks verzoekt.   
3.  Elke Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst neemt op zich geen enkele opzettelijke maatregel te treffen die direct of indirect schade zou kunnen toebrengen aan het in de artikelen 1 en 2 bedoelde cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed dat gelegen is op het grondgebied van andere Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst.

3.  De vergaderingen van de Commissie kunnen worden bijgewoond, in een adviserende hoedanigheid, door een vertegenwoordiger van het Internationaal Centrum voor de Studie tot het behoud en de restauratie van culturele goederen (Centrum van Rome), een vertegenwoordiger van de Internationale Raad voor Monumenten en Landschappen (ICOMOS) en een vertegenwoordiger van de Internationale Unie voor behoud van de natuur en de natuurlijke hulpbronnen (IUCN) waaraan op verzoek van de Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, bijeenkomende in een algemene vergadering tijdens de gewone zittingen van de Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur, vertegenwoordigers van andere intergouvernementele of niet-gouvernementele organisaties met soortgelijke doelstellingen kunnen worden toegevoegd.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De zittingsperiode van Staten die lid zijn van de Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed loopt van het einde van de gewone zitting van de Algemene Vergadering tijdens welke zij zijn gekozen tot en met het einde van de derde daarop volgende gewone zitting.

De zittingsperiode van een derde van de tijdens de eerste verkiezing aangewezen leden eindigt evenwel aan het slot van de eerste gewone zitting van de Algemene Vergadering volgende op die waarin zij werden gekozen; de zittingsperiode van een ander derde van de op hetzelfde tijdstip aangewezen leden eindigt aan het slot van de tweede gewone zitting van de Algemene Vergadering volgende op die waarin zij werden gekozen. De namen van deze leden worden door middel van loting aangewezen door de Voorzitter van de Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur na de eerste verkiezing.   
3.  Staten die lid zijn van de Commissie wijzen als hun vertegenwoordigers personen aan die deskundig zijn op het gebied van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed.   

### Artikel  10

2.  De Commissie kan te allen tijde overheidsorganisaties of particuliere organisaties of personen uitnodigen deel te nemen aan haar vergaderingen ten einde hen te raadplegen over bijzondere vraagstukken.   
3.  De Commissie kan voor zover zij dit voor de uitvoering van haar taak nodig acht, raadgevende organen in het leven roepen.   

### Artikel  11  

1.  Elke Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst legt, voor zover zulks hem mogelijk is, aan de Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed een inventaris over van de goederen die deel uitmaken van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed, gelegen op zijn grondgebied en in aanmerking komend voor plaatsing op de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde lijst. Deze inventaris, die niet als uitputtend wordt beschouwd, dient documentatie te omvatten omtrent de ligging en de betekenis van het desbetreffende goed.   
2.  Op basis van de overeenkomstig het eerste lid door de Staten overgelegde inventarissen zal de Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed een lijst opstellen, bijhouden en publiceren, onder de titel „Lijst van het Werelderfgoed”, van de goederen die deel uitmaken van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed als omschreven in de artikelen 1 en 2 van deze Overeenkomst, die zij volgens door haar opgestelde normen als van uitzonderlijke universele waarde beschouwt. Ten minste om de twee jaar wordt een bijgewerkte lijst verspreid.   
3.  Voor het opnemen van een goed in de „Lijst van het Werelderfgoed” is de toestemming van de betrokken Staat vereist. Het opnemen van een goed dat is gelegen op een grondgebied, waarover meer dan een Staat soevereiniteit of rechtsmacht meent te bezitten, doet op geen enkele wijze afbreuk aan de rechten van de partijen in het geschil.   
4.  De Commissie zal, wanneer de omstandigheden zulks vereisen, onder de titel „Lijst van bedreigd Werelderfgoed” een lijst opstellen, bijhouden en publiceren van op de Lijst van het Werelderfgoed voorkomende goederen voor welker behoud omvangrijke werken noodzakelijk zijn en waarvoor krachtens de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst bijstand is gevraagd. Deze lijst dient een raming van de kosten der uit te voeren werken te omvatten. Op deze lijst mogen slechts onderdelen van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed voorkomen die worden bedreigd door ernstige en duidelijk omschreven gevaren, zoals het gevaar van verdwijning door een steeds sneller verval, plannen voor grote openbare of particuliere werken, projecten voor stadsuitbreiding of ontwikkeling van het toerisme, vernietiging veroorzaakt door wijziging in gebruik of eigendom van de grond, grote veranderingen tengevolge van onbekende oorzaken, onbeheerd laten om welke reden dan ook, dreigende of reeds uitgebroken gewapende conflicten, natuurrampen en andere rampen, grote branden, aardbevingen, grondverschuivingen, vulkanische uitbarstingen, wijzigingen in het waterniveau, overstromingen, vloedgolven. De Commissie kan in geval van dringende noodzaak op elk tijdstip overgaan tot een nieuwe inschrijving op de Lijst van bedreigd Werelderfgoed en deze inschrijving onmiddellijk bekendmaken.   
5.  De Commissie omschrijft de normen op grond waarvan een goed dat behoort tot het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed kan worden opgenomen in een van de in het tweede en vierde lid van dit artikel bedoelde lijsten.   
6.  Alvorens een aanvraag tot inschrijving op een van de beide in het tweede en vierde lid van dit artikel bedoelde lijsten te weigeren, raadpleegt de Commissie de Staat die partij is bij deze Overeenkomst en op wiens grondgebied het desbetreffende onderdeel van het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed is gelegen.   
7.  Met instemming van de betrokken Staten coördineert en bevordert de Commissie de studies en het onderzoek die nodig zijn voor de opstelling van de in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde lijsten.   

### Artikel  12  

De omstandigheid dat een goed behorend tot het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed niet is opgenomen in een van de beide in het eerste en tweede lid van artikel 11 bedoelde lijsten mag in genen dele zo worden uitgelegd als zou het geen uitzonderlijke universele waarde hebben om andere redenen dan die welke voortvloeien uit het opnemen in deze lijsten.  

### Artikel  13  

1.  De Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed ontvangt en bestudeert verzoeken om internationale bijstand, gedaan door Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, met betrekking tot goederen die deel uitmaken van op hun grondgebied gelegen cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed en zijn opgenomen in de in het tweede en vierde lid van artikel 11 bedoelde lijsten of daarvoor in aanmerking komen. Het doel van deze verzoeken kan zijn de bescherming, het behoud en het toegankelijk maken van zodanige goederen te waarborgen of daaraan een nieuwe bestemming te geven.   
2.  Verzoeken om internationale bijstand op grond van het eerste lid van dit artikel kunnen ook betrekking hebben op de identificatie van culturele en natuurlijke goederen als omschreven in de artikelen 1 en 2, indien een voorlopig onderzoek gerede gronden verschaft tot voortzetting daarvan.   
3.  De Commissie beslist over de te nemen maatregelen ten aanzien van deze verzoeken, bepaalt in voorkomende gevallen de aard en de omvang van haar bijstand en machtigt tot het sluiten uit haar naam van de noodzakelijke overeenkomsten met de betrokken regering.   
4.  De Commissie bepaalt in welke rangorde de werkzaamheden worden verricht. Zij houdt hierbij rekening met het respectieve belang van de te beschermen goederen voor het cultureel en natuurlijk erfgoed van de wereld, met de noodzaak internationale bijstand te verschaffen ten behoeve van goederen die het meest kenmerkend zijn voor de natuurlijke omgeving of voor de talenten en de geschiedenis van de volken der wereld, met de urgentie van de uit te voeren werken, met de omvang van de middelen van de Staten op wier grondgebied de bedreigde goederen zijn gelegen en in het bijzonder met de mate waarin zij de redding van die goederen door eigen middelen zouden kunnen waarborgen.   
5.  De Commissie stelt een lijst op van de goederen waarvoor internationale bijstand is verschaft en publiceert en verspreidt deze.   
6.  De Commissie besluit over het gebruik van de middelen van het krachtens het bepaalde in artikel 15 van deze Overeenkomst gestichte Fonds. Zij tracht wegen te vinden ten einde deze middelen te vermeerderen en neemt daartoe alle ter zake dienende maatregelen.   
7.  De Commissie werkt samen met internationale en nationale, gouvernementele en niet-gouvernementele organisaties die soortgelijke doelen als die van deze Overeenkomst nastreven. Voor de uitvoering van haar programma's en projecten kan de Commissie een beroep doen op die organisaties en met name op het Internationaal Centrum voor de Studie tot het behoud en de restauratie van culturele goederen (Centrum van Rome), de Internationale Raad voor Monumenten en Landschappen (ICOMOS) en de Internationale Unie voor behoud van de natuur en de natuurlijke hulpbronnen (IUCN), alsmede op overheidsorganen en particuliere organen en personen.   
8.  De besluiten van de Commissie worden genomen met een meerderheid van twee derden van de aanwezige leden die hun stem uitbrengen. Het quorum wordt gevormd door de meerderheid van de leden van de Commissie.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  De Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed wordt bijgestaan door een secretariaat dat wordt benoemd door de Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur.   
2.  De Directeur-Generaal van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur stelt de documentatie en de agenda voor de vergaderingen van de Commissie op, daarbij zoveel mogelijk gebruik makend van de diensten van het Internationaal Centrum voor de studie tot het behoud en de restauratie van culturele goederen (Centrum van Rome), de Internationale Raad voor Monumenten en Landschappen (ICOMOS) en de Internationale Unie voor behoud van de natuur en de natuurlijke hulpbronnen (IUCN) op de onderscheiden gebieden waar zij bevoegd en bekwaam zijn, en is verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering van haar besluiten.

4.  De bijdragen aan het Fonds en andere vormen van aan de Commissie ter beschikking gestelde bijstand kunnen slechts worden gebruikt voor door de Commissie te omschrijven doeleinden. De Commissie kan bijdragen ontvangen die slechts voor een bepaald programma of project mogen worden gebruikt, op voorwaarde dat de Commissie een besluit heeft genomen over de uitvoering van een zodanig programma of project. Aan bijdragen verstrekt aan het Fonds mogen geen politieke voorwaarden worden verbonden.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  Onverminderd eventuele aanvullende vrijwillige bijdragen nemen de Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst op zich regelmatig om de twee jaar aan het Fonds voor het Werelderfgoed bijdragen te betalen waarvan het bedrag, in de vorm van een uniform, voor alle Staten geldend percentage, zal worden bepaald door de algemene vergadering van de Staten die partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst tijdens de zittingen van de Algemene Vergadering van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur.

### Artikel  24  

Internationale bijstand op uitgebreide schaal dient te worden voorafgegaan door uitvoerige wetenschappelijke, economische en technische studies. Bij deze studies dient gebruik te worden gemaakt van de meest moderne technieken voor het beschermen, behouden en toegankelijk maken van en het geven van een nieuwe bestemming aan het natuurlijk en cultureel erfgoed en zij dienen verenigbaar te zijn met de doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst. Deze studies dienen ook te zijn gericht op een rationeel gebruik van de in de betrokken Staat beschikbare middelen.  

### Artikel  25  

Over het algemeen zal slechts een deel van de kosten der noodzakelijke werkzaamheden ten laste komen van de internationale gemeenschap.
