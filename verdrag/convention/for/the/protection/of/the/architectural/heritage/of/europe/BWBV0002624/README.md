####IDENTIFICATION OF PROPERTIES TO BE PROTECTED

### Article  2  

For the purpose of precise identification of the monuments, groups of buildings and sites to be protected, each Party undertakes to maintain inventories and in the event of threats to the properties concerned, to prepare appropriate documentation at the earliest opportunity.

### Article  4  

Each Party undertakes: 

1. to implement appropriate supervision and authorisation procedures as required by the legal protection of the properties in question;  

2. to prevent the disfigurement, dilapidation or demolition of protected properties. To this end, each Party undertakes to introduce, if it has not already done so, legislation which: 

a. requires the submission to a competent authority of any scheme for the demolition or alteration of monuments which are already protected, or in respect of which protection proceedings have been instituted, as well as any scheme affecting their surroundings;  

b. requires the submission to a competent authority of any scheme affecting a group of buildings or a part thereof or a site which involves 

- demolition of buildings  

- the erection of new buildings  

- substantial alterations which impair the character of the buildings or the site;

Each Party undertakes: 

1. to provide financial support by the public authorities for maintaining and restoring the architectural heritage on its territory, in accordance with the national, regional and local competence and within the limitations of the budgets available;

####CONSERVATION POLICIES

### Article  10
