####Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air

The States Parties to this Convention Recognizing the significant contribution of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed in Warsaw on 12 October 1929, hereinafter referred to as the “Warsaw Convention", and other related instruments to the harmonization of private international air law; Recognizing the need to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments; Recognizing the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution; Reaffirming the desirability of an orderly development of international air transport operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944; Convinced that collective State action for further harmonization and codification of certain rules governing international carriage by air through a new Convention is the most adequate means of achieving an equitable balance of interests; Have agreed as follows:

####GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article  1  

####Scope of Application

1.  This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.

For the purposes of this Convention, the expressioninternational carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage of a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. *international carriage* means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage of a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.   
3.  Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.   
4.  This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter V, subject to the terms contained therein.   

### Article  2  

####Carriage Performed by State and Carriage of Postal Items

####LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER AND EXTENT OF COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE

### Article  17

2.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of destruction or loss of, or of damage to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or during any period within which the checked baggage was in the charge of the carrier. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents.   
3.  If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the cheked baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.   
4.  Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term “baggage" means both checked baggage and unchecked baggage.   

### Article  18  

####Damage to Cargo

1.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.   
2.  However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent it proves that the destruction, or loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted from one or more of the following: 

a) inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;  

b) defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or its servants or agents;  

c) an act of war or an armed conflict;  

d) an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo.     
3.  The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier.   
4.  The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by inland waterway performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. If a carrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period of carriage by air.   

### Article  19  

####Delay

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.  

### Article  20  

####Exoneration

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger. This Article applies to all the liability provisons in this Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.  

### Article  21  

####Compensation in Case of Death or Injury of Passengers

1.  For damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 not exceeding 113 100 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, the carrier shall not be able to exclude or limits its liability.   
2.  The carrier shall not be liable for damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 to the extent that they exceed for each passenger 100 000 Special Drawing Rights if the carrier proves that: 

a) such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or  

b) such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.     

### Article  22  

####Limits of Liability in Relation to Delay, Baggage and Cargo

1.  In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 694 Special Drawing Rights.   
2.  In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 131 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger unless the passenger has made, at the time when the checked baggage was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the passenger's actual interest in delivery at destination.   
3.  In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to a sum of 19 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor's actual interest in delivery at destination.   
4.  In the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.   
5.  The foregoing provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that such servant or agent was acting within the scope of its employment.   
6.  The limits prescribed in Article 21 and in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff, including interest. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.   

### Article  23  

####Conversion of Monetary Units

1.  The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Rights at the date of the judgement. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by teh International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgement, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.   
2.  Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier prescribed in Article 21 is fixed at a sum of 1 500 000 monetary units per passenger in judicial proceedings in their territories; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme wiht respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.   
3.  The calcultation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1 of this Article. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.   

### Article  24  

####Review of Limits

1.  Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 25 of this Convention and subject tot paragraph 2 below, the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 21, 22 and 23 shall be reviewed by the Depositary at five-year intervals, the first such review to take place at the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Convention, or if the Convention does not enter into force within five years of the date it is first open for signature, whithin the first year of its entry into force, by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of the Convention. The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23.   
2.  If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become effective six months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties. The Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.   
3.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if there has been no previous revision. Subsequent reviews using the procedure described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals starting at the end ofthe fifth year following the date of the reviews under the present paragraph.

### Article  29  

####Basis of Claims

2.  The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, its servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits.   
3.

As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger of consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier which performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.   

### Article  37  

####Right of Recourse against Third Parties

Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.  

### Chapter  IV

### Chapter  V  

####CARRIAGE BY AIR PERFORMED BY A PERSON OTHER THAN THE CONTRACTING CARRIER

### Article  39  

####Contracting Carrier – Actual Carrier

The provisions of this Chapter apply when a person (herinafter referred to as “the contracting carrier") as a principal makes a contract of carriage governed by this Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor, and another person (herinafter referred to as “the actual carrier") performs, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, the whole or part of the carriage, but is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of this Convention. Such authority shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.  

### Article  40  

####Respective Liability of Contracting and Actual Carriers

If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the contract referred to in Article 39, is governed by this Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, be subject to the rules of this Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract, the latter solely for the carriage which it performs.  

### Article  41  

####Mutual Liability

1.  The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of ther employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier.   
2.  The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights of defences conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by it.   

### Article  42  

####Addressee of Complaints and Instructions

Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, instructions referred to in Article 12 shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.  

### Article  43  

####Servants and Agents

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent they are, unless it is proved that they acted in a manner that prevents the limits of liability from being invoked in accordance with this Convention.  

### Article  44  

####Aggregation of Damages

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to that person.  

### Article  45  

####Addressee of Claims

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or seperately. If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.  

### Article  46  

####Additional Jurisdiction

Any action for damages contemplated in Article 45 must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 33, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.  

### Article  47  

####Invalidity of Contractual Provisions

Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Chapter or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Chapter shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Chapter.  

### Article  48  

####Mutual Relations of Contracting and Actual Carriers

Except as provided in Article 45, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the carriers between themselves, including any right of recourse of indemnification.  

### Chapter  VI  

####OTHER PROVISIONS

### Article  49  

####Mandatory Application

Any clause contained in the contract of carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.  

### Article  50

The provisions of Articles 3 to 5, 7 and 8 relating to the documentation of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of a carrier's business.

####Verdrag tot het brengen van eenheid in enige bepalingen inzake het internationale luchtvervoer

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag Erkennend de belangrijke bijdrage van het Verdrag tot het brengen van eenheid in enige bepalingen inzake het internationale luchtvervoer ondertekend te Warschau op 12 oktober 1929, hierna aangeduid als het „Verdrag van Warschau", en andere bijbehorende instrumenten ter harmonisering van het internationale privaatrechtelijke luchtrecht; Erkennend de noodzaak het Verdrag van Warschau en bijbehorende instrumenten te moderniseren en te herzien; Erkennend het belang van het waarborgen van bescherming van de belangen van consumenten in het internationale luchtvervoer en de noodzaak van billijke schadevergoeding gegrond op het beginsel van restitutie; Opnieuw bevestigend de wenselijkheid van een ordelijke ontwikkeling van de afhandeling van het internationale luchtvervoer en de vlotte doorstroom van passagiers, bagage en goederen overeenkomstig de beginselen en doelstellingen van het Verdrag inzake de internationale burgerluchtvaart, gesloten te Chicago op 7 december 1944; Ervan overtuigd dat een gezamenlijk optreden van de Staten ter verdere harmonisatie en codificatie van enige bepalingen tot regeling van het internationale luchtvervoer door middel van een nieuw Verdrag het beste middel is om een billijk evenwicht van de belangen te bereiken; Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  1  

####Toepassingsgebied

1.  Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op al het internationale vervoer van personen, bagage of goederen dat met luchtvaartuigen tegen betaling plaats heeft. Het is eveneens van toepassing op kosteloos vervoer per luchtvaartuig door een luchtvervoeronderneming verricht.   
2.  Onder internationaal vervoer in de zin van dit Verdrag wordt verstaan alle vervoer waarbij, volgens overeenkomst tussen Partijen, de plaats van vertrek en de plaats van bestemming, zij er al dan niet onderbreking van het vervoer of overlading, zijn gelegen hetzij op het grondgebied van twee Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, hetzij op het grondgebied van een enkele Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag indien een tussenlanding wordt voorzien binnen het grondgebied van een andere Staat, zelfs indien die Staat geen Partij is bij het Verdrag. Het vervoer zonder een zodanige tussenlanding tussen twee punten binnen het grondgebied van een enkele Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag wordt niet beschouwd als internationaal in de zin van dit Verdrag.   
3.  Het vervoer, te verrichten door verschillende opeenvolgende luchtvervoerders, wordt voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag geacht een enkel vervoer te vormen, wanneer het door de partijen als een enkele handeling is beschouwd, of het nu in de vorm van een enkele overeenkomst dan wel in de vorm van een reeks van overeenkomsten is gesloten, en het verliest zijn internationaal karakter niet door de omstandigheid dat een enkele overeenkomst of een reeks van overeenkomsten ten volle moet worden uitgevoerd binnen het grondgebied van dezelfde Staat.   
4.  Dit Verdrag is tevens van toepassing op het vervoer bedoeld in Hoofdstuk V, behoudens de bepalingen van dat hoofdstuk.   

### Artikel  2  

####Vervoer verricht door de Staat en vervoer van postzendingen

1.  Dit Verdrag is op vervoer verricht door de Staat of door andere openbare lichamen van toepassing onder de voorwaarden genoemd in artikel 1.   
2.  Bij het vervoer van postzendingen is de vervoerder slechts aansprakelijk tegenover de betrokken postadministratie overeenkomstig de regels die van toepassing zijn op de verhouding tussen de vervoerders en de postadministraties.   
3.  Behoudens het bepaalde in het tweede lid van dit artikel zijn de bepalingen van dit Verdrag niet van toepassing op het vervoer van postzendingen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####DOCUMENTEN EN VERPLICHTINGEN VAN DE PARTIJEN BETREFFENDE HET VERVOER VAN PASSAGIERS, BAGAGE EN GOEDEREN

### Artikel  3  

####Passagiers en bagage

1.  Bij het vervoer van passagiers dient een individueel of collectief vervoersdocument te worden afgegeven, bevattende: 

a) de aanduiding van de plaatsen van vertrek en van bestemming;  

b) indien de plaatsen van vertrek en van bestemming gelegen zijn binnen het grondgebied van eenzelfde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, terwijl één of meer tussenlandingen worden voorzien binnen het grondgebied van een andere Staat, de aanduiding van één van de plaatsen van tussenlanding.     
2.  De afgifte van het in het eerste lid bedoelde vervoersdocument kan worden vervangen door het gebruik van ieder ander middel waardoor de in dat lid vermelde gegevens worden vastgelegd. Indien een dergelijk ander middel wordt gebruikt biedt de vervoerder aan, de passagier een schriftelijke verklaring te verstrekken van de aldus vastgelegde gegevens.   
3.  De vervoerder verstrekt aan de passagier een identificatielabel voor elk stuk aangegeven bagage.   
4.  Aan de passagier wordt een schriftelijke mededeling verstrekt vermeldend dat, wanneer dit Verdrag van toepassing is, het de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerders regelt en kan beperken ter zake van dood of letsel en in geval van vernieling, verlies of beschadiging van de bagage, alsmede in geval van vertraging.   
5.  Niet-inachtneming van het bepaalde in de voorgaande leden doet niet af aan het bestaan of de geldigheid van de vervoerovereenkomst, die desondanks onderworpen zal zijn aan de regels van dit Verdrag, met inbegrip van die betreffende de beperking van de aansprakelijkheid.   

### Artikel  4  

####Goederen

1.  Bij het vervoer van goederen moet een luchtvrachtbrief worden afgegeven.   
2.  De afgifte van een luchtvrachtbrief kan worden vervangen door het gebruik van ieder ander middel waardoor de gegevens betreffende het te verrichten vervoer worden vastgelegd. Indien van zodanig ander middel gebruik wordt gemaakt, verstrekt de vervoerder aan de afzender, op diens verzoek, een goederenontvangstbewijs dat de identificatie van de zending mogelijk maakt en toegang geeft tot de door die andere middelen vastgelegde gegevens.   

### Artikel  5  

####Inhoud van de luchtvrachtbrief of van het goederenontvangstbewijs

De luchtvrachtbrief of het goederenontvangstbewijs moet bevatten: 

a) de aanduiding van de plaatsen van vertrek en van bestemming;

####Document inzake de aard van de goederen

Indien nodig ter vervulling van de formaliteiten van douane, politie en andere overheidsinstanties, kan van de afzender worden verlangd dat hij een document afgeeft dat de aard van de goederen aanduidt.

1.  De luchtvrachtbrief wordt door de afzender opgemaakt in drie oorspronkelijke exemplaren.   
2.  Het eerste exemplaar bevat de vermelding „voor de vervoerder"; het wordt getekend door de afzender. Het tweede exemplaar bevat de vermelding „voor de geadresseerde"; het wordt getekend door de afzender en de vervoerder. Het derde exemplaar wordt getekend door de vervoerder en door hem, na ontvangst van de goederen, overhandigd aan de afzender.   
3.  De handtekening van de vervoerder en die van de afzender kunnen worden gedrukt of vervangen door een stempel.   
4.  Indien, op verzoek van de afzender, de vervoerder de luchtvrachtbrief opmaakt, wordt deze laatste, behoudens tegenbewijs, geacht te handelen namens de afzender.   

### Artikel  8  

####Documenten betreffende verscheidene colli

Wanneer er verscheidene colli zijn 

a) heeft de vervoerder van goederen het recht van de afzender te verlangen dat hij aparte luchtvrachtbrieven opmaakt;  

b) heeft de afzender het recht van de vervoerder te verlangen dat hij aparte goederenontvangstbewijzen afgeeft, wanneer gebruik wordt gemaakt van de in artikel 4, tweede lid, bedoelde andere middelen.    

### Artikel  9  

####Het niet naleven van bepalingen betreffende voorgeschreven documenten

Niet-inachtneming van het bepaalde in de artikelen 4 tot en met 8 doet niet af aan het bestaan of de geldigheid van de vervoerovereenkomst, die desondanks onderworpen zal zijn aan de regels van dit Verdrag, met inbegrip van die betreffende de beperking van de aansprakelijkheid.  

### Artikel  10  

####Aansprakelijkheid voor de op de documenten geplaatste bijzonderheden

1.  De afzender is verantwoordelijk voor de juistheid van de bijzonderheden en verklaringen betreffende de goederen die door of namens hem in de luchtvrachtbrief zijn opgenomen, of die door of namens hem zijn verstrekt aan de vervoerder voor opneming in het goederenontvangstbewijs of in de gegevens vastgelegd door de andere middelen bedoeld in artikel 4, tweede lid. Het voorgaande is eveneens van toepassing in het geval waarin de namens de afzender handelende persoon tevens namens de vervoerder handelt.   
2.  De afzender is aansprakelijk voor alle schade die door de vervoerder of door enige andere persoon jegens wie de vervoerder aansprakelijk is, wordt geleden als gevolg van de onnauwkeurigheid, onjuistheid of onvolledigheid van de bijzonderheden en verklaringen die door of namens de afzender zijn verstrekt.   
3.  Behoudens het bepaalde in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel is de vervoerder aansprakelijk voor alle schade die door de afzender of door enige andere persoon jegens wie de afzender aansprakelijk is, wordt geleden als gevolg van de onnauwkeurigheid, onjuistheid of onvolledigheid van de bijzonderheden en verklaringen die door of namens de vervoerder zijn opgenomen in het goederenontvangstbewijs of in de gegevens vastgelegd door de andere middelen bedoeld in artikel 4, tweede lid.   

### Artikel  11  

####Bewijskracht van de documenten

1.  De luchtvrachtbrief en het goederenontvangstbewijs strekken, behoudens tegenbewijs, tot bewijs van het sluiten van de overeenkomst, van de ontvangst van de goederen en van de vervoervoorwaarden die erin worden vermeld.   
2.  De opgaven in de luchtvrachtbrief en het goederenontvangstbewijs betreffende het gewicht, de afmetingen en de verpakking van de goederen, alsmede betreffende het aantal colli, hebben kracht van bewijs, behoudens tegenbewijs; die betreffende de hoeveelheid, de omvang en de toestand van de goederen leveren slechts bewijs op jegens de vervoerder voorzover zij door hem zijn geverifieerd in tegenwoordigheid van de afzender en daarvan melding is gemaakt in de luchtvrachtbrief, of indien het opgaven betreft die betrekking hebben op de uiterlijke staat van de goederen.   

### Artikel  12  

####Recht om over de goederen te beschikken

1.  Onder voorwaarde dat hij alle uit de vervoerovereenkomst voortvloeiende verplichtingen nakomt, heeft de afzender het recht over de goederen te beschikken, hetzij door deze op de luchthaven van vertrek of van bestemming terug te nemen, hetzij door deze tijdens de reis bij een landing op te houden, hetzij door deze te doen afleveren op de plaats van bestemming of tijdens de reis aan een ander dan de oorspronkelijk aangewezen geadresseerde, hetzij door terugzending te vragen naar de luchthaven van vertrek, voor zover de uitoefening van dat recht geen nadeel toebrengt aan de vervoerder of aan de andere afzenders en met de verplichting de daaruit voortvloeiende kosten te vergoeden.   
2.  Indien uitvoering van de opdrachten van de afzender onmogelijk is, moet de vervoerder hem daarvan onmiddellijk in kennis stellen.   
3.  Indien de vervoerder de opdrachten van de afzender betreffende de beschikking over de goederen uitvoert, zonder overlegging te vorderen van het aan deze afgegeven exemplaar van de luchtvrachtbrief of van het goederenontvangsbewijs, is hij, behoudens zijn recht van verhaal op de afzender, aansprakelijk voor de schade die daardoor veroorzaakt mocht worden aan de regelmatige houder van de luchtvrachtbrief of van het goederenontvangstbewijs.   
4.  Het recht van de afzender eindigt op het moment, waarop dat van de geadresseerde begint, overeenkomstig artikel 13. Indien evenwel de geadresseerde de goederen weigert, of indien hij niet bereikt kan worden, herkrijgt de afzender zijn beschikkingsrecht.   

### Artikel  13  

####Aflevering van de goederen

1.  Tenzij de afzender het hem ingevolge artikel 12 toekomende recht heeft uitgeoefend, heeft de geadresseerde het recht om, na aankomst van de goederen op de plaats van bestemming, van de vervoerder aflevering van de goederen te vorderen tegen betaling van de verschuldigde bedragen en onder naleving van de vervoervoorwaarden.   
2.  Tenzij anders is bedongen moet de vervoerder de geadresseerde onmiddellijk van de aankomst van de goederen in kennis stellen.   
3.  Indien het verlies van de goederen door de vervoerder wordt erkend, of indien de goederen na afloop van een termijn van zeven dagen, nadat zij hadden moeten aankomen, niet zijn aangekomen, is de geadresseerde gerechtigd de rechten die uit de vervoerovereenkomst voortvloeien jegens de vervoerder geldend te maken.   

### Artikel  14  

####Geldend maken van de rechten van de afzender en de geadresseerde

De afzender en de geadresseerde kunnen alle rechten doen gelden die hun respectievelijk in de artikelen 12 en 13 zijn toegekend, ieder op zijn eigen naam, onverschillig of zij handelen in hun eigen belang of in dat van een ander, onder voorwaarde dat zij de door de vervoerovereenkomst opgelegde verplichtingen nakomen.  

### Artikel  15  

####Verhouding tussen de afzender en de geadresseerde of verhouding tussen derde partijen

1.  De artikelen 12, 13 en 14 laten onverlet zowel de verhouding tussen de afzender en de geadresseerde onderling als de verhouding tussen derden die hun rechten ontlenen aan de afzender of de geadresseerde.   
2.  Van de artikelen 12, 13 en 14 kan alleen worden afgeweken door een uitdrukkelijke bepaling in de luchtvrachtbrief of in het goederenontvangstbewijs.   

### Artikel  16  

####Formaliteiten van douane, politie of andere overheidsinstanties

1.  De afzender is verplicht de inlichtingen en de documenten te verschaffen die, vóór de afgifte van de goederen aan de geadresseerde, nodig zijn om aan de formaliteiten inzake douane, politie of andere overheidsinstanties te voldoen. De afzender is jegens de vervoerder aansprakelijk voor alle schade die het gevolg is van het ontbreken, de onvolledigheid of de onnauwkeurigheid van die inlichtingen en documenten, behoudens in geval van schuld aan de zijde van de vervoerder of van diens hulppersonen.   
2.  De vervoerder is niet gehouden te onderzoeken of deze inlichtingen en documenten juist of voldoende zijn.   

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####AANSPRAKELIJKHEID VAN DE VERVOERDER EN OMVANG VAN DE VERGOEDING VAN DE SCHADE

### Artikel  17  

####Dood of letsel geleden door de passagier – Schade toegebracht aan de bagage

1.  De vervoerder is aansprakelijk voor schade die wordt geleden in geval van dood of lichamelijk letsel van een passagier, op grond van het enkele feit dat het ongeval dat de dood of het letsel heeft veroorzaakt, plaats heeft gehad aan boord van het luchtvaartuig of tijdens enige handeling verband houdende met het aan boord gaan of het verlaten van het luchtvaartuig.   
2.  De vervoerder is aansprakelijk voor schade die wordt geleden in geval van vernieling, verlies of beschadiging van aangegeven bagage, op grond van het enkele feit dat de gebeurtenis die de vernieling, het verlies of de beschadiging heeft veroorzaakt, plaats heeft gehad aan boord van het luchtvaartuig of gedurend enig tijdvak waarin de vervoerder de aangegeven bagage onder zijn hoede had. Evenwel is de vervoerder niet aansprakelijk indien en voor zover de schade enkel en alleen het gevolg is van de aard of een eigen gebrek van de bagage. In het geval van niet aangegeven bagage, daaronder begrepen persoonlijke bezittingen, is de vervoerder aansprakelijk indien de schade voortvloeit uit zijn schuld of die van zijn hulppersonen.   
3.  Indien de vervoerder het verlies van aangegeven bagage erkent of indien de aangegeven bagage niet op de bestemming is aangekomen binnen eenentwintig dagen volgend op de datum waarop zij had moeten aankomen, is de passagier gerechtigd tegen de vervoerder de rechten te doen gelden die voortvloeien uit de vervoerovereenkomst.   
4.  Behoudens andersluidende bepalingen wordt in dit Verdrag onder „bagage" zowel aangegeven als niet aangegeven bagage verstaan.   

### Artikel  18  

####Schade toegebracht aan goederen

1.  De vervoerder is aansprakelijk voor schade die wordt geleden in geval van vernieling, verlies of beschadiging van goederen, op grond van het enkele feit dat de gebeurtenis die de schade heeft veroorzaakt, plaats heeft gehad tijdens het luchtvervoer.   
2.  Evenwel is de vervoerder niet aansprakelijk indien en voorzover hij bewijst dat de vernieling, het verlies of de beschadiging van de goederen het gevolg is van een of meer van de volgende omstandigheden: 

a) de aard of een eigen gebrek van de goederen;  

b) gebrekkige verpakking van de goederen door een ander dan de vervoerder of diens ondergeschikten;  

c) een oorlogshandeling of een gewapend conflict;  

d) een overheidsdaad verricht in verband met de invoer, uitvoer of doorvoer van de goederen.     
3.  Het luchtvervoer, bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, omvat het tijdvak waarin de goederen zich onder de hoede van de vervoerder bevinden.   
4.  Het tijdvak van het luchtvervoer omvat geen enkel vervoer over land, zee of binnenwateren, verricht buiten een luchthaven. Indien dergelijk vervoer evenwel plaatsvindt ter uitvoering van een luchtvervoerovereenkomst met het oog op de inlading, aflevering of overlading, wordt elke schade, behoudens tegenbewijs, geacht het gevolg te zijn van een gebeurtenis die tijdens het luchtvervoer plaats heeft gehad. Indien de vervoerder, zonder de instemming van de afzender, het vervoer dat tussen de partijen is overeengekomen als luchtvervoer geheel of gedeeltelijk vervangt door een andere wijze van vervoer, wordt deze andere wijze van vervoer geacht deel uit te maken van het tijdvak van het luchtvervoer.   

### Artikel  19  

####Vertraging

De vervoerder is aansprakelijk voor de schade voortvloeiend uit vertraging in het luchtvervoer van passagiers, bagage of goederen. De vervoerder is echter niet aansprakelijk voor de schade voortvloeiend uit vertraging indien hij bewijst dat hij en zijn hulppersonen alle maatregelen hebben genomen die redelijkerwijs gevergd konden worden om de schade te vermijden, of dat het hun onmogelijk was dergelijke maatregelen te nemen.  

### Artikel  20  

####Ontheffing van aansprakelijkheid

Indien de vervoerder bewijst dat schuld of nalatigheid van de persoon die schadevergoeding vordert of van de persoon aan wie deze zijn rechten ontleent, de schade heeft veroorzaakt of daartoe heeft bijgedragen, is de vervoerder geheel of gedeeltelijk ontheven van zijn aansprakelijkheid jegens die persoon, voor zover die schuld of nalatigheid de schade heeft veroorzaakt of daartoe heeft bijgedragen. Wanneer schadevergoeding wordt gevorderd wegens dood of letsel van een passagier door een ander dan de passagier, is de vervoerder eveneens geheel of gedeeltelijk ontheven van zijn aansprakelijkheid voor zover hij bewijst dat de schuld of nalatigheid van die passagier de schade heeft veroorzaakt of daartoe heeft bijgedragen. Dit artikel is van toepassing op alle bepalingen van dit Verdrag inzake aansprakelijkheid, met inbegrip van artikel 21, eerste lid.  

### Artikel  21  

####Schadevergoeding in geval van dood of van letsel door de passagier geleden

1.  Voor schade bedoeld in artikel 17, eerste lid, die niet de 113 100 bijzondere trekkingsrechten per passagier te boven gaat, kan de vervoerder zijn aansprakelijkheid niet beperken of uitsluiten.   
2.  De vervoerder is niet aansprakelijk voor de in artikel 17, eerste lid, bedoelde schade voor zover deze de 100.000 bijzondere trekkingsrechten per passagier te boven gaat, indien hij bewijst dat: 

a) de schade niet te wijten was aan de schuld of nalatigheid van hem of van zijn hulppersonen, of  

b) de schade uitsluitend te wijten was aan de schuld of nalatigheid van een derde.     

### Artikel  22  

####Aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen met betrekking tot vertraging, bagage en goederen

1.  In geval van schade geleden door passagiers ten gevolge van vertraging, als bedoeld in artikel 19, is de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder beperkt tot het bedrag van 4 694 bijzondere trekkingsrechten per passagier.   
2.  Bij het vervoer van bagage is de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder in geval van vernieling, verlies, beschadiging of vertraging beperkt tot het bedrag van 1 131 bijzondere trekkingsrechten per passagier, behoudens bijzondere verklaring omtrent belang bij de aflevering, gedaan door de passagier bij de afgifte van de aangegeven bagage aan de vervoerder en tegen betaling van een eventueel verhoogd tarief. In dat geval is de vervoerder verplicht te betalen tot het bedrag van de opgegeven som, tenzij hij bewijst dat deze het werkelijke belang van de passagier bij de aflevering te boven gaat.   
3.  Bij het vervoer van goederen is de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder, in geval van vernieling, verlies, beschadiging of vertraging beperkt tot het bedrag van 19 bijzondere trekkingsrechten per kilogram, behoudens bijzondere verklaring omtrent belang bij de aflevering, gedaan door de afzender bij de afgifte van het collo aan de vervoerder en tegen betaling van een eventueel verhoogd tarief. In dat geval is de vervoerder verplicht te betalen tot het bedrag van de opgegeven som, tenzij hij bewijst dat deze het werkelijke belang van de afzender bij de aflevering te boven gaat.   
4.  In geval van vernieling, verlies, beschadiging of vertraging van een deel van de goederen, of van enig daarin opgenomen voorwerp, wordt ter bepaling van de aansprakelijkheidsgrens van de vervoerder alleen het totale gewicht van het betrokken collo of van de betrokken colli in aanmerking genomen. Wanneer evenwel de vernieling, het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging van een deel van de goederen of van enig daarin opgenomen voorwerp, de waarde beinvloedt van andere colli gedekt door dezelfde luchtvrachtbrief of door hetzelfde goederenontvangstbewijs of, bij ontbreken van deze documenten, door dezelfde gegevens vastgelegd door de in artikel 4, tweede lid, bedoelde andere middelen, wordt het totale gewicht van deze colli in aanmerking genomen ter bepaling van de aansprakelijkheidsgrens.   
5.  De bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel zijn niet van toepassing indien wordt bewezen dat de schade het gevolg is van een handeling of nalaten van de vervoerder of van zijn hulppersonen welke plaats vond hetzij met de bedoeling schade te veroorzaken, hetzij roekeloos en met de wetenschap dat schade waarschijnlijk het gevolg zou zijn, voor zover, in het geval van een handeling of nalaten van hulppersonen, tevens wordt bewezen dat zij handelden in de uitoefening van hun dienstbetrekking.   
6.  De in artikel 21 en in dit artikel gestelde grenzen beletten de rechter niet om volgens zijn wet daarenboven nog het geheel of een gedeelte van de gerechtskosten en van de overige proceskosten die door de eiser zijn gemaakt, toe te wijzen, rente daaronder begrepen. De voorgaande bepaling is niet van toepassing indien het bedrag van de toegewezen schadevergoeding, hierbij niet inbegrepen de gerechtskosten en andere proceskosten, niet het bedrag te boven gaat dat de vervoerder schriftelijk aan de eiser heeft aangeboden binnen een termijn van zes maanden gerekend vanaf de datum van het voorval, dat de schade heeft veroorzaakt, of vóór de aanvang van het proces indien dit na die termijn aanhangig is gemaakt.   

### Artikel  23  

####Omrekening van munteenheden

1.  De in dit Verdrag in bijzondere trekkingsrechten uitgedrukte bedragen worden geacht betrekking te hebben op het bijzondere trekkingsrecht zoals dit is omschreven door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds. De omrekening van deze bedragen in de nationale munteenheden geschiedt, in geval van een gerechtelijke procedure, volgens de waarde van die munteenheden, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten op de datum van het vonnis. De waarde uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten van de nationale munteenheid van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, die lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend volgens de waarderingsmethode die door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds op de datum van het vonnis wordt toegepast voor zijn eigen verrichtingen en transacties. De waarde uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten van de nationale munteenheid van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, die geen lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend op een door die Staat vastgestelde wijze.   
2.  Niettemin kunnen de Staten die geen lid zijn van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en waarvan de wet de toepassing van de bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel niet toelaat, op het tijdstip van bekrachtiging of toetreding, of op enig tijdstip nadien, verklaren dat de in artikel 21 voorgeschreven aansprakelijkheidsgrens van de vervoerder in gerechtelijke procedures op hun grondgebied wordt vastgesteld op een bedrag van 1.500.000 monetaire eenheden per passagier; op 62.500 monetaire eenheden per passagier wat betreft artikel 22, eerste lid; op 15.000 monetaire eenheden per passagier wat betreft artikel 22, tweede lid; en op 250 monetaire eenheden per kilogram wat betreft artikel 22, derde lid. Deze monetaire eenheid komt overeen met vijfenzestig en een half milligram goud van een gehalte van negenhonderd duizendste fijn. De bedragen kunnen in de betrokken nationale munteenheid worden omgerekend in ronde cijfers. De omrekening van deze bedragen in de nationale munteenheid geschiedt volgens de wet van de betrokken Staat.   
3.  De in de laatste zin van het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde berekening en de in het tweede lid van dit artikel genoemde omrekening geschieden op zodanige wijze dat, in de nationale munteenheid van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag zoveel mogelijk dezelfde werkelijke waarde tot uitdrukking komt voor de bedragen genoemd in de artikelen 21 en 22, als zou voortvloeien uit de toepassing van de eerste drie zinnen van het eerste lid van dit artikel. De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag delen aan de depositaris hun wijze van berekening overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel mee of, in voorkomend geval, het resultaat van de omrekening overeenkomstig het tweede lid van dit artikel, bij het nederleggen van hun akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van dit Verdrag of van toetreding hiertoe en telkens wanneer zich een verandering voordoet in deze wijze van berekening of in het resultaat van de omrekening.   

### Artikel  24  

####Herziening van de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen

1.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in artikel 25 van dit Verdrag en behoudens het tweede lid van dit artikel worden de in de artikelen 21, 22 en 23 voorgeschreven aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen elke vijf jaar door de depositaris herzien, waarbij de eerste herziening plaatsvindt aan het einde van het vijfde jaar volgend op de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag of, indien het Verdrag niet in werking treedt binnen vijf jaar na de datum van openstelling voor ondertekening, in het eerste jaar van zijn inwerkingtreding, door middel van toepassing van een inflatiecoëfficiënt overeenkomend met het cumulatieve inflatiepercentage sedert de vorige herziening of, in het geval van een eerste herziening, sedert de datum van inwerkingtreding van het Verdrag. De te gebruiken maat voor het inflatiepercentage om de inflatiecoëfficiënt te bepalen is het gewogen gemiddelde van het jaarlijkse percentage van de stijging of de daling van de indices van de consumptieprijzen van de Staten waarvan de munteenheden het in artikel 23, eerste lid, genoemde bijzondere trekkingsrecht vormen.   
2.  Indien de in het vorige lid bedoelde herziening vaststelt dat de inflatiecoëfficiënt de 10% heeft overschreden, geeft de depositaris aan de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag kennis van een herziening van de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen. Een dergerlijke herziening wordt van kracht zes maanden na kennisgeving ervan aan de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. Indien binnen drie maanden na deze kennisgeving aan de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, een meerderheid van die Staten kennis geeft van haar afkeuring, wordt de herziening niet van kracht en verwijst de depositaris de kwestie naar een bijeenkomst van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. De depositaris geeft onverwijld aan alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag kennis van het inwerkingtreden van elke herziening.   
3.  Ongeacht het eerste lid van dit artikel is de in het tweede lid van dit artikel bedoelde procedure te allen tijde van toepassing, mits een derde van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag de wens daartoe te kennen geeft en mits de in het eerste lid bedoelde inflatiecoëfficiënt hoger is dan 30% sinds de vorige herziening of sinds de datum van inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag indien geen eerdere herziening heeft plaatsgevonden. Latere herzieningen volgens de in het eerste lid van dit artikel beschreven procedure vinden plaats elke vijf jaar vanaf het einde van het vijfde jaar volgend op de datum van de herziening die heeft plaatsgevonden uit hoofde van dit lid.   

### Artikel  25  

####Beding over de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen

Een vervoerder kan bedingen dat de vervoerovereenkomst hogere aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen bevat dan die welke zijn bepaald in dit Verdrag, of dat zij geen enkele aansprakelijkheidsgrens bevat.  

### Artikel  26  

####Nietigheid van bepalingen in de overeenkomst

Elk beding, strekkende om de vervoerder te ontheffen van zijn aansprakelijkheid of om een lagere grens vast te stellen dan die welke in dit Verdrag is bepaald, is nietig en van onwaarde, maar de nietigheid van dat beding heeft niet de nietigheid ten gevolge van de overeenkomst, die onderworpen blijft aan de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  27  

####Contractvrijheid

Niets in dit Verdrag kan de vervoerder beletten het sluiten van een vervoerovereenkomst te weigeren, af te zien van de verweermiddelen die hem uit hoofde van dit Verdrag zijn gegeven, of voorwaarden op te nemen die niet in tegenspraak zijn met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  28  

####Voorschotten

In geval van een luchtvaartongeval dat leidt tot de dood of letsel van passagiers betaalt de vervoerder, indien hij daartoe gehouden is door zijn nationale wet, onverwijld voorschotten aan de natuurlijke persoon of personen die recht hebben op schadevergoeding opdat zij kunnen voorzien in hun onmiddellijke economische behoeften. Deze voorschotten vormen geen erkenning van aansprakelijkheid en zij kunnen in mindering worden gebracht op de later door de vervoerder bij wijze van schadevergoeding te betalen bedragen.  

### Artikel  29  

####Basis voor vorderingen

Bij het vervoer van passagiers, bagage en goederen kan elke vordering tot schadevergoeding, op welke grond dan ook, hetzij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag hetzij op grond van een overeenkomst, een onrechtmatige daad of anderszins, slechts worden ingesteld onder de voorwaarden en binnen de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen bedoeld in dit Verdrag, zonder dat hiermee iets bepaald is omtrent de personen die een vordering kunnen instellen en omtrent hun onderscheiden rechten. Bij een dergelijke vordering kan men geen schadevergoeding verkrijgen bij wijze van straf of voorbeeld noch uit anderen hoofde dan tot herstel van geleden schade.  

### Artikel  30  

####Hulppersonen – Totaal bedrag van de schadevergoeding

1.  Indien een geding wordt aanhangig gemaakt tegen een hulppersoon van de vervoerder ter zake van schade als bedoeld in dit Verdrag, kan deze hulppersoon, indien hij bewijst dat hij heeft gehandeld in de uitoefening van zijn dienstbetrekking, zich beroepen op de voorwaarden en de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen die de vervoerder zelf kan inroepen uit hoofde van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Het totaalbedrag van de schadevergoeding die in dat geval kan worden verkregen van de vervoerder en van zijn hulppersonen, mag de genoemde grenzen niet overschrijden.   
3.  Behoudens voor het vervoer van goederen zijn de bepalingen van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel niet van toepassing indien wordt bewezen dat de schade het gevolg is van een handeling of nalaten van de hulppersoon die plaatsvond hetzij met de bedoeling schade te veroorzaken, hetzij roekeloos en met de wetenschap dat schade waarschijnlijk het gevolg zou zijn.   

### Artikel  31  

####Termijnen voor protest

1.  De aanneming door de geadresseerde, zonder protest, van de aangegeven bagage of de goederen, vestigt, behoudens tegenbewijs, het vermoeden, dat de bagage en de goederen in goede staat en in overeenstemming met het vervoersdocument of de gegevens vastgelegd door de andere middelen bedoeld in artikel 3, tweede lid en artikel 4, tweede lid, zijn afgeleverd.   
2.  In geval van beschadiging moet de geadresseerde protest doen aan de vervoerder onmiddellijk na ontdekking van de beschadiging en uiterlijk binnen een termijn van zeven dagen voor de aangegeven bagage en van veertien dagen voor de goederen, te rekenen van de aanneming. In geval van vertraging moet het protest worden gedaan uiterlijk binnen eenentwintig dagen, te rekenen van de dag waarop de bagage of de goederen te zijner beschikking zijn gesteld.   
3.  Elk protest moet schriftelijk worden ingebracht en overhandigd of verzonden binnen de voorgeschreven termijnen.   
4.  Bij gebreke van protest binnen de voorgeschreven termijnen is elke rechtsvordering tegen de vervoerder niet ontvankelijk, tenzij in geval van diens bedrog.   

### Artikel  32  

####Overlijden van de aansprakelijke persoon

In geval van overlijden van de aansprakelijke persoon is een rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding ontvankelijk, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, tegen hen die wettig zijn of haar nalatenschap vertegenwoordigen.  

### Artikel  33  

####Rechterlijke bevoegdheid

1.  De rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding moet ter keuze van de eiser worden ingesteld binnen het gebied van een der Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, hetzij voor de rechter van de woonplaats van de vervoerder, of van de hoofdzetel van diens onderneming of van de plaats waar hij een vestiging heeft, door de zorg waarvan de overeenkomst is gesloten, hetzij voor de rechter van de plaats van bestemming.   
2.  In geval van schade ten gevolge van de dood of lichamelijk letsel van een passagier kan de rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding worden ingesteld voor een van de rechters genoemd in het eerste lid van dit artikel of op het grondgebied van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag waar de passagier op het tijdstip van het ongeval zijn duurzaam hoofdverblijf heeft en waarheen of van waaruit de vervoerder luchtvervoerdiensten onderhoudt, hetzij met zijn eigen luchtvaartuigen, hetzij met luchtvaartuigen van een andere vervoerder uit hoofde van een handelsovereenkomst, en waarin deze vervoerder zijn luchtvervoeractiviteiten verricht vanuit ruimten die hijzelf of een andere vervoerder met wie hij een handelsovereenkomst heeft gesloten, huurt of bezit.   
3.  Voor de toepassing van het tweede lid: 

a) wordt onder „handelsovereenkomst" verstaan een overeenkomst, anders dan een agentschapsovereenkomst, gesloten tussen vervoerders en strekkend tot het gemeenschappelijk verrichten van diensten van luchtvervoer van passagiers;  

b) wordt door „duurzaam hoofdverblijf" aangeduid de enige vaste en duurzame verblijfplaats van de passagier op het tijdstip van het ongeval. De nationaliteit van de passagier is in dit opzicht niet de beslissende factor.     
4.  De rechtspleging wordt beheerst door de wet van de rechter voor wie de zaak is aanhangig gemaakt.   

### Artikel  34  

####Arbitrage

1.  Behoudens de bepalingen van dit artikel kunnen de partijen bij de goederenvervoerovereenkomst bedingen dat elk geschil inzake de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder uit hoofde van dit Verdrag wordt beslist door middel van arbitrage. Deze afspraak wordt schriftelijk vastgelegd.   
2.  De arbitrage vindt, naar keuze van de eiser, plaats in een van de plaatsen van een bevoegde rechter bedoeld in artikel 33.   
3.  De scheidsman of het scheidsgerecht past de bepalingen van dit Verdrag toe.   
4.  De bepalingen van het tweede en derde lid van dit artikel worden geacht deel uit te maken van elk scheidsrechterlijk beding of elke scheidsrechterlijke overeenkomst, en elke bepaling in een dergelijk beding of in dergelijke overeenkomst die daarmee in strijd is, is nietig.   

### Artikel  35  

####Termijn voor vorderingen tot schadevergoeding

1.  De rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding moet, op straffe van verval, worden ingesteld binnen een termijn van twee jaar te rekenen van de aankomst ter bestemming, of van de dag waarop het luchtvaartuig had moeten aankomen, of van de onderbreking van het vervoer.   
2.  De wijze van de berekening van de termijn wordt beheerst door de wet van de rechter voor wie de vordering is aanhangig gemaakt.   

### Artikel  36  

####Opeenvolgende vervoerders

1.  In de gevallen waarin het vervoer beheerst wordt door het gestelde in artikel 1, derde lid, en het verricht moet worden achtereenvolgens door verschillende vervoerders, is elke vervoerder die passagiers, bagage of goederen aanneemt, onderworpen aan de in dit Verdrag gestelde bepalingen, en wordt hij geacht een der partijen bij de vervoerovereenkomst te zijn, voor zover die overeenkomst betrekking heeft op het deel van het vervoer, dat onder zijn toezicht is verricht.   
2.  In geval van zodanig vervoer hebben de passagier of enige andere persoon die een van deze afgeleid recht op schadevergoeding heeft enkel verhaal op de vervoerder die het vervoer heeft verricht gedurende hetwelk het ongeval of de vertraging plaats vond, behalve in het geval, waarin de eerste vervoerder bij uitdrukkelijk beding de aansprakelijkheid voor de gehele reis op zich heeft genomen.   
3.  Indien het bagage of goederen betreft, heeft de passagier of de afzender verhaal op de eerste vervoerder, en de passagier of de geadresseerde die recht op afgifte heeft, heeft verhaal op de laatste vervoerder, en beiden kunnen daarenboven de vervoerder aanspreken die het vervoer heeft verricht gedurende hetwelk de vernieling, het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging plaats vond. Deze vervoerders zijn hoofdelijk aansprakelijk jegens de passagier, of jegens de afzender of de geadresseerde.   

### Artikel  37  

####Recht van verhaal tegen derden

Dit Verdrag laat de vraag onverlet of degene die op grond van de bepalingen daarvan aansprakelijk is, verhaal heeft op een ander.  

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####GECOMBINEERD VERVOER

### Artikel  38  

####Gecombineerd vervoer

1.  In geval van gecombineerd vervoer, dat wordt verricht gedeeltelijk door de lucht en gedeeltelijk met enig ander middel van vervoer, zijn de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, behoudens artikel 18, vierde lid, enkel van toepassing op het luchtvervoer en dat slechts indien dit aan de voorwaarden van artikel 1 beantwoordt.   
2.  Geen bepaling van dit Verdrag belet partijen om in geval van gecombineerd vervoer in het luchtvervoerdocument voorwaarden op te nemen betreffende andere wijzen van vervoer, op voorwaarde dat de bepalingen van dit Verdrag wat betreft het luchtvervoer in acht worden genomen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####LUCHTVERVOER VERRICHT DOOR EEN ANDERE PERSOON DAN DE CONTRACTUELE VERVOERDER

### Artikel  39  

####Contractuele vervoerder – Feitelijke vervoerder

De bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk zijn van toepassing wanneer een persoon (hierna genoemd „contractueel vervoerder") een door dit Verdrag beheerste vervoerovereenkomst sluit met een passagier of een afzender of met een persoon die handelt namens de passagier of de afzender, en een andere persoon (hierna genoemd „feitelijk vervoerder"), op grond van een machtiging van de contractuele vervoerder, het geheel of een deel van het vervoer verricht maar niet een opvolgende vervoerder is in de zin van dit Verdrag. Zonder bewijs van het tegendeel wordt het bestaan van een dergelijke machtiging aangenomen.  

### Artikel  40  

####Onderscheiden aansprakelijkheid van de contractuele vervoerder en de feitelijke vervoerder

Indien een feitelijke vervoerder het geheel of een deel van een vervoer verricht dat, overeenkomstig de in artikel 39 bedoelde overeenkomst, wordt beheerst door dit Verdrag, zijn zowel de contractuele vervoerder als de feitelijke vervoerder, behalve indien in dit hoofdstuk anders is bepaald, onderworpen aan de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, de eerste voor het gehele in de overeenkomst voorziene vervoer, de tweede slechts voor het vervoer dat hij verricht.  

### Artikel  41  

####Wederzijdse toerekening

1.  De handelingen en nalatigheiden van de feitelijke vervoerder of van zijn hulppersonen die handelen in de uitoefening van hun dienstbetrekking worden, met betrekking tot het door de feitelijke vervoerder verrichte vervoer, tevens geacht die van de contractuele vervoerder te zijn.   
2.  De handelingen en nalatigheden van de contractuele vervoerder of van zijn hulppersonen die handelen in de uitoefening van hun dienstbetrekking worden, met betrekking tot het door de feitelijke vervoerder verrichte vervoer, tevens geacht die van de feitelijke vervoerder te zijn. Niettemin zal geen van deze handelingen of nalatigheden de feitelijke vervoerder aansprakelijk kunnen maken boven de in de artikelen 21, 22, 23 en 24 gestelde grenzen. Geen bijzonder beding op grond waarvan de contractuele vervoerder verplichtingen op zich neemt die niet door dit Verdrag zijn opgelegd, geen afstand van rechten of verweermiddelen die door dit Verdrag worden verleend, en geen bijzondere verklaring omtrent het belang bij de aflevering, bedoeld in artikel 22 van dit Verdrag, zullen van kracht zijn ten aanzien van de feitelijke vervoerder, tenzij hij daarin heeft toegestemd.   

### Artikel  42  

####Degenen aan wie opdrachten en protesten kunnen worden gericht

De opdrachten en protesten die op grond van dit Verdrag tot de vervoerder worden gericht, hebben hetzelfde gevolg of zij zijn gericht tot de contractuele vervoerder dan wel tot de feitelijke vervoerder. Niettemin zijn de in artikel 12 bedoelde opdrachten slechts van kracht indien zij worden gericht tot de contractuele vervoerder.  

### Artikel  43  

####Hulppersonen

Wat het door de feitelijke vervoerder verrichte vervoer betreft, kan elke hulppersoon van deze vervoerder of van de contractuele vervoerder, indien hij bewijst dat hij heeft gehandeld in de uitoefening van zijn dienstbetrekking, zich beroepen op de voorwaarden en de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen die uit hoofde van dit Verdrag van toepassing zijn op de vervoerder wiens hulppersoon hij is, tenzij wordt bewezen dat hij op zodanige wijze heeft gehandeld dat geen beroep kan worden gedaan op de aansprakelijkheidsgrenzen overeenkomstig dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  44  

####Totaal bedrag van schadevergoeding

Wat het door de feitelijke vervoerder verrichte vervoer betreft, kan het totale bedrag van de schadevergoeding dat kan worden verkregen van deze vervoerder, van de contractuele vervoerder en van hun hulppersonen wanneer zij hebben gehandeld in de uitoefening van hun dienstbetrekking, niet hoger zijn dan het hoogste bedrag dat uit hoofde van dit Verdrag ten laste kan worden gebracht van hetzij de contractuele vervoerder, hetzij de feitelijke vervoerder, met dien verstande dat geen van de in dit artikel genoemde personen aansprakelijk zal kunnen zijn boven de op die persoon toepasselijke grens.  

### Artikel  45  

####Degene aan wie vorderingen tot schadevergoeding kunnen worden gericht

Elke rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding met betrekking tot het door de feitelijke vervoerder verrichte vervoer moet, naar keuze van de eiser, worden ingesteld tegen die vervoerder of de contractuele vervoerder dan wel tegen beiden gezamenlijk of afzonderlijk. Indien de rechtsvordering wordt ingesteld tegen slechts één van deze vervoerders, heeft die vervoerder het recht de andere vervoerder in vrijwaring op te roepen, waarbij de rechtspleging wordt beheerst door de wet van die rechter voor wie de vordering aanhangig is gemaakt.  

### Artikel  46  

####Aanvullende rechtsbevoegdheid

Elke in artikel 45 genoemde rechtsvordering tot schadevergoeding moet, naar keuze van de eiser, op het grondgebied van een van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, worden ingesteld hetzij voor een van de rechters voor wie overeenkomstig artikel 33 een vordering kan worden ingesteld tegen de contractuele vervoerder, hetzij voor de rechter van de woonplaats van de feitelijke vervoerder of van de plaats waar de hoofdzetel van diens onderneming is gevestigd.  

### Artikel  47  

####Nietigheid van de contractuele bepalingen

Elk beding strekkend tot ontheffing van de aansprakelijkheid van de contractuele vervoerder of de feitelijke vervoerder uit hoofde van dit hoofdstuk of tot vaststelling van een lagere grens dan die welke in dit hoofdstuk is vastgesteld is nietig en van onwaarde, maar de nietigheid van dit beding brengt niet de nietigheid van de overeenkomst mee, die onderworpen blijft aan de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk.  

### Artikel  48  

####Onderlinge verhouding tussen de contractuele vervoerder en de feitelijke vervoerder

Behoudens artikel 45 doet geen bepaling van dit hoofdstuk afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen van de vervoerders onderling, waaronder begrepen elk recht op verhaal of schadevergoeding.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####OVERIGE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  49  

####Verplichting tot toepassing

Nietig en van onwaarde zijn alle bedingen in de vervoerovereenkomst en alle bijzondere overeenkomsten, getroffen vóór het ontstaan van de schade, waarbij de partijen van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag zouden afwijken, hetzij door aanwijzing van een wet, die zou moeten worden toegepast, hetzij door een wijziging van de voorschriften betreffende de rechterlijke bevoegdheid.  

### Artikel  50  

####Verzekering

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag eisen dat hun vervoerders voorzien zijn van een toereikende verzekering ter dekking van hun aansprakelijkheid uit hoofde van dit Verdrag. Een vervoerder kan, door de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag die de bestemming is van de door hem uitgevoerde diensten, gehouden worden het bewijs te leveren dat hij voorzien is van een toereikende verzekering ter dekking van zijn aansprakelijkheid uit hoofde van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  51  

####Vervoer verricht in bijzondere omstandigheden

De bepalingen van de artikelen 3 tot en met 5, 7 en 8 betreffende de vervoersdocumenten zijn niet van toepassing op vervoer dat in bijzondere omstandigheden buiten elke normale uitoefening van het luchtvervoerbedrijf plaats heeft.  

### Artikel  52  

####Omschrijving van de term „dag"

Wanneer in dit Verdrag sprake is van dagen, worden kalenderdagen en niet werkdagen bedoeld.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####SLOTBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  53
