##Verdrag inzake handel met voorkennis

####Convention on insider trading

Preamble  

The member States of the Council of Europe, signatories hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members: Considering that certain financial transactions in securities traded on stock exchanges are carried out by persons seeking to avoid losses or to make profits by using the privileged information available to them, thus undermining equality of opportunity between investors and the credibility of the market; Considering that such behaviour is also proving dangerous for the economies of the member States concerned and in particular for the proper functioning of the stock markets; Considering that, because of the internationalisation of markets and the ease of present-day communications, operations of this nature are carried out sometimes on the market of a State by persons not resident in that State or acting through persons not resident there; Considering that efforts to counter such practices which are already being made on the domestic level in many member States make it essential to set up specific machinery to deal with these situations and co-ordinate endeavours at international level. Have agreed as follows:
