##Verdrag inzake de doorvoerhandel van en naar Staten zonder zeekust

####Convention on transit trade of land-locked States

*Preamble*  The States Parties to the present Convention, Recalling that article 55 of its Charter requires the United Nations to promote conditions of economic progress and solutions of international economic problems, Noting General Assembly resolution 1028 (XI) on the land-locked countries and the expansion of international trade which, “recognizing the need of land-locked countries for adequate transit facilities in promoting international trade”, invited “the Governments of Member States to give full recognition to the needs of land-locked Member States in the matter of transit trade and, therefore, to accord them adequate facilities in terms of international law and practice in this regard, bearing in mind the future requirements resulting from the economic development of the land-locked countries”, Recalling article 2 of the Convention on the High Seas which states that the high seas being open to all nations, no State may validly purport to subject any part of them to its sovereignty and article 3 of the said Convention which states: 

“1. In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with coastal States, States having no sea-coast should have free access to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State having no sea-coast shall by common agreement with the latter and in conformity with existing international conventions accord: 

(a) To the State having no sea-coast, on a basis of reciprocity, free transit through their territory; and  

(b) To ships flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their own ships, or to the ships of any other States, as regards access to seaports and the use of such ports.    

“2. States situated between the sea and a State having no sea-coast shall settle, by mutual agreement with the latter, and taking into account the rights of the coastal State or State of transit and the special conditions of the State having no sea-coast, all matters relating to freedom of transit and equal treatment in ports, in case such States are not already parties to existing international conventions.”   Reaffirming the following principles adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development with the understanding that these principles are interrelated and each principle should be construed in the context of the other principles:  *Principle I*  The recognition of the right of each land-locked State of free access to the sea is an essential principle for the expansion of international trade and economic development.  *Principle II*  In territorial and on internal waters, vessels flying the flag of land-locked countries should have identical rights and enjoy treatment identical to that enjoyed by vessels flying the flag of coastal States other than the territorial State.  *Principle III*  In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with coastal States, States having no sea-coast should have free access to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State having no sea-coast shall by common agreement with the latter and in conformity with existing international conventions accord to ships flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their own ships or to the ships of any other State as regards access to seaports and the use of such ports.  *Principle IV*  In order to promote fully the economic development of the land-locked countries, the said countries should be afforded by all States, on the basis of reciprocity, free and unrestricted transit, in such a manner that they have free access to regional and international trade in all circumstances and for every type of goods. Goods in transit should not be subject to any customs duty. Means of transport in transit should not be subject to special taxes or charges higher than those levied for the use of means of transport of the transit country.  *Principle V*  The State of transit, while maintaining full sovereignty over its territory, shall have the right to take all indispensable measures to ensure that the exercise of the right of free and unrestricted transit shall in no way infringe its legitimate interests of any kind.  *Principle VI*  In order to accelerate the evolution of a universal approach to the solution of the special and particular problems of trade and development of land-locked countries in the different geographical areas, the conclusion of regional and other international agreements in this regard should be encouraged by all States.  *Principle VII*  The facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked countries in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause.  *Principle VIII*  The principles which govern the right of free access to the sea of the land-locked State shall in no way abrogate existing agreements between two or more contracting parties concerning the problems, nor shall they raise an obstacle as regards the conclusions of such agreements in the future, provided that the latter do not establish a regime which is less favourable than or opposed to the above-mentioned provisions.   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

####Definitions

For the purpose of this Convention, 

(a) the term “land-locked State” means any Contracting State which has no sea-coast;  

(b) the term “traffic in transit” means the passage of goods including unaccompanied baggage across the territory of a Contracting State between a land-locked State and the sea when the passage is a portion of a complete journey which begins or terminates within the territory of that land-locked State and which includes sea transport directly preceding or following such passage. The trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, and change in the mode of transport of such goods as well as the assembly, disassembly or reassembly of machinery and bulky goods shall not render the passage of goods outside the definition of “traffic in transit” provided that any such operation is undertaken solely for the convenience of transportation. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any Contracting State to establish or permit the establishment of permanent facilities on its territory for such assembly, disassembly or reassembly;  

(c) the term “transit State” means any Contracting State with or without a sea-coast, situated between a land-locked State and the sea, through whose territory “traffic in transit” passes;  

(d) the term “means of transport” includes: 

(i) any railway stock, seagoing and river vessels and road vehicles;  

(ii) where the local situation so requires porters and pack animals;  

(iii) if agreed upon by the Contracting States concerned, other means of transport and pipelines and gas lines   when they are used for traffic in transit within the meaning of this article.    

### Article  2  

####Freedom of transit

1.  Freedom of transit shall be granted under the terms of this Convention for traffic in transit and means of transport. Subject to the other provisions of this Convention, the measures taken by Contracting States for regulating and forwarding traffic across their territory shall facilitate traffic in transit on routes in use mutually acceptable for transit to the Contracting States concerned. Consistent with the terms of this Convention, no discrimination shall be exercised which is based on the place of origin, departure, entry, exit or destination or on any circumstances relating to the ownership of the goods or the ownership, place of registration or flag of vessels, land vehicles or other means of transport used.   
2.  The rules governing the use of means of transport, when they pass across part or the whole of the territory of another Contracting State, shall be established by common agreement among the Contracting States concerned, with due regard to the multilateral international conventions to which these States are parties.   
3.  Each Contracting State shall authorize, in accordance with its laws, rules and regulations, the passage across or access to its territory of persons whose movement is necessary for traffic in transit.   
4.  The Contracting States shall permit the passage of traffic in transit across their territorial waters in accordance with the principles of customary international law or applicable international conventions and with their internal regulations.   

### Article  3  

####Customs duties and special transit dues

Traffic in transit shall not be subjected by any authority within the transit State to customs duties or taxes chargeable by reason of importation or exportation nor to any special dues in respect of transit. Nevertheless on such traffic in transit there may be levied charges intended solely to defray expenses of supervision and administration entailed by such transit. The rate of any such charges must correspond as nearly as possible with the expenses they are intended to cover and, subject to that condition, the charges must be imposed in conformity with the requirement of non-discrimination laid down in article 2, paragraph 1.  

### Article  4  

####Means of transport and tariffs

1.  The Contracting States undertake to provide, subject to availability, at the points of entry and exit, and as required at points of trans-shipment, adequate means of transport and handling equipment for the movement of traffic in transit without unnecessary delay.   
2.  The Contracting States undertake to apply to traffic in transit, using facilities operated or administered by the State, tariffs or charges which, having regard to the conditions of the traffic and to considerations of commercial competition, are reasonable as regards both their rates and the method of their application. These tariffs or charges shall be so fixed as to facilitate traffic in transit as much as possible, and shall not be higher than the tariffs or charges applied by Contracting States for the transport through their territory of goods of countries with access to the sea. The provisions of this paragraph shall also extend to the tariffs and charges applicable to traffic in transit using facilities operated or administered by firms or individuals, in cases in which the tariffs or charges are fixed or subject to control by the Contracting State. The term “facilities” used in this paragraph shall comprise means of transport, port installations and routes for the use of which tariffs or charges are levied.   
3.  Any haulage service established as a monopoly on waterways used for transit must be so organized as not to hinder the transit of vessels.   
4.  The provisions of this article must be applied under the conditions of non-discrimination laid down in article 2, paragraph 1.   

### Article  5  

####Methods and documentation in regard to customs, transport, etc.

2.  The Contracting States undertake to use simplified documentation and expeditious methods in regard to customs, transport and other administrative procedures relating to traffic in transit for the whole transit journey on their territory, including any trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, and changes in the mode of transport as may take place in the course of such journey.   

### Article  6  

####Storage of goods in transit

1.  The conditions of storage of goods in transit at the points of entry and exit, and at intermediate stages in the transit State may be established by agreement between the States concerned. The transit States shall grant conditions of storage at least as favourable as those granted to goods coming from or going to their own countries.   
2.  The tariffs and charges shall be established in accordance with article 4.   

### Article  7

### Article  8  

####Free zones or other customs facilities

1.  For convenience of traffic in transit, free zones or other customs facilities may be provided at the ports of entry and exit in the transit States, by agreement between those States and the land-locked States.   
2.  Facilities of this nature may also be provided for the benefit of land-locked States in other transit States which have no sea-coast or seaports.   

### Article  9  

####Provision of greater facilities

This Convention does not entail in any way the withdrawal of transit facilities which are greater than those provided for in the Convention and which under conditions consistent with its principles, are agreed between Contracting States or granted by a Contracting State. The Convention also does not preclude such grant of greater facilities in the future.  

### Article  10  

####Relation to most-favoured-nation clause

1.  The Contracting States agree that the facilities and special rights accorded by this Convention to land-locked States in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause. A land-locked State which is not a Party to this Convention may claim the facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked States under this Convention only on the basis of the most-favoured-nation clause of a treaty between that land-locked State and the Contracting State granting such facilities and special rights.   
2.  If a Contracting State grants to a land-locked State facilities or special rights greater than those provided for in this Convention, such facilities or special rights may be limited to that land-locked State, except in so far as the withholding of such greater facilities or special rights from any other land-locked State contravenes the most-favoured-nation provision of a treaty between such other land-locked State and the Contracting State granting such facilities or special rights.   

### Article  11  

####Exceptions to Convention on grounds of public health, security, and protection of intellectual property

1.  No Contracting State shall be bound by this Convention to afford transit to persons whose admission into its territory is forbidden, or for goods of a kind of which the importation is prohibited, either on grounds of public morals, public health or security, or as a precaution against diseases of animals or plants or against pests.   
2.  Each Contracting State shall be entitled to take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that persons and goods, particularly goods which are the subject of a monopoly, are really in transit, and that the means of transport are really used for the passage of such goods, as well as to protect the safety of the routes and means of communication.   
3.  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the measures which a Contracting State may be called upon to take in pursuance of provisions in a general international convention, whether of a worldwide or regional character, to which it is a party, whether such convention was already concluded on the date of this Convention or is concluded later, when such provisions relate: 

(a) to export or import or transit of particular kinds of articles such as narcotics, or other dangerous drugs, or arms; or  

(b) to protection of industrial, literary or artistic property, or protection of trade names, and indications of source or appellations of origin, and the suppression of unfair competition.     
4.  Nothing in this Convention shall prevent any Contracting State from taking any action necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.   

### Article  12  

####Exceptions in case of emergency

The measures of a general or particular character which a Contracting State is obliged to take in case of an emergency endangering its political existence or its safety may, in exceptional cases and for as short a period as possible, involve a deviation from the provisions of this Convention on the understanding that the principle of freedom of transit shall be observed to the utmost possible extent during such a period.  

### Article  13  

####Application of the Convention in time of war

This Convention does not prescribe the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The Convention shall, however, continue in force in time of war so far as such rights and duties permit.

Each party to the dispute shall appoint one member to the commission, while the third member, who shall be the Chairman, shall be chosen in common agreement between the parties. If the parties fail to agree on the designation of the third member within a period of three months, the third member shall be appointed by the President of the International Court of Justice. In case any of the parties fail to make an appointment within a period of three months the President of the International Court of Justice shall fill the remaining vacancy or vacancies.

####Verdrag inzake de doorvoerhandel van en naar Staten zonder zeekust

*Preambule*  De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, In herinnering brengende, dat de Verenigde Naties ingevolge artikel 55 van hun Handvest voorwaarden van economische vooruitgang en de oplossing van internationale economische vraagstukken dienen te bevorderen, Gelet op resolutie 1028 (XI) van de Algemene Vergadering de landen zonder zeekust en de uitbreiding van de internationale handel betreffende, waarmede „onder erkenning van de behoefte van landen zonder zeekust aan toereikende doorvoermogelijkheden bij het bevorderen van de internationale handel”, de regeringen van de Lid-Staten werd verzocht „de behoeften van de Lid-Staten zonder zeekust ten aanzien van de doorvoerhandel ten volle te erkennen en deze staten met het oog daarop toereikende faciliteiten op het gebied van het daarop betrekking hebbende internationale recht en gebruik toe te staan, daarbij rekening houdende met de uit de economische ontwikkeling in de toekomst voortvloeiende behoeften van de landen zonder zeekust”, In herinnering brengend artikel 2 van het Verdrag inzake de volle zee, dat bepaalt dat, aangezien de volle zee voor alle naties open is, geen enkele Staat op wettige wijze enig deel van de volle zee aan zijn soevereiniteit kan onderwerpen, alsmede artikel 3 van het genoemde Verdrag, dat bepaalt: 

„1. Ten einde de vrijheid van de zee te kunnen genieten op gelijke voet met kuststaten, dienen Staten die geen zeekust hebben, vrije toegang tot de zee te hebben. Te dien einde dienen Staten die gelegen zijn tussen de zee en een Staat die geen zeekust heeft, in gemeenschappelijk overleg met laatstbedoelde Staat en in overeenstemming met de bestaande internationele verdragen: 

(a) aan de staat die geen zeekust heeft, op basis van wederkerigheid, vrije doortocht en doorvoer over hun gebied te verlenen en  

(b) aan schepen die de vlag van die Staat voeren, een behandeling toe te kennen, welke gelijk is aan de behandeling toegekend aan hun eigen schepen of aan de schepen van enige andere Staat, wat betreft toegang tot zeehavens en het gebruik van zodanige havens.    

2. De Staten die gelegen zijn tussen de zee en een Staat die geen zeekust heeft, dienen in gemeenschappelijk overleg met laatstbedoelde Staat en rekening houdende met de rechten van de kuststaat of de Staat die doortocht en doorvoer verleent, en met de bijzondere omstandigheden van de Staat die geen zeekust heeft, alle kwesties te regelen die verband houden met de vrijheid van doortocht en doorvoer en met gelijke behandeling in de havens, indien die Staten niet reeds partij zijn bij bestaande internationale verdragen.”   Opnieuw bevestigende de volgende door de Conferentie der Verenigde Naties voor Handel en Ontwikkeling aangenomen beginselen, waarbij wel te verstaan is dat deze beginselen onderling verband houden en dat ieder beginsel moet worden beoordeeld in zijn samenhang met de andere beginselen:  *Beginsel I*  De erkenning van het recht van vrije toegang tot de zee van ieder land zonder zeekust is een essentieel beginsel voor de uitbreiding van de internationale handel en voor de economische ontwikkeling.  *Beginsel II*  Schepen die varen onder de vlag van landen zonder zeekust dienen in territoriale wateren en op binnenwateren gelijke rechten te hebben en daaraan dient een behandeling te worden toegekend die gelijk is aan de behandeling toegekend aan schepen die varen onder de vlag van aan de zeekust gelegen Staten, niet zijnde de Staat aan wie het desbetreffende grondgebied toebehoort.  *Beginsel III*  Ten einde op gelijke voet met aan de kust gelegen Staten de vrijheid der zeeën te genieten, dienen Staten zonder zeekust vrije toegang tot de zee te hebben. Met het oog daarop kennen Staten, gelegen tussen de zee en een Staat zonder zeekust, in gemeenschappelijk overleg met de laatste en overeenkomstig bestaande internationale verdragen, aan schepen die de vlag van die Staat voeren, wat de toegang tot zeehavens en het gebruik van die havens betreft, een behandeling toe die gelijk is aan de behandeling toegekend aan hun eigen schepen of aan schepen van een andere Staat.  *Beginsel IV*  Voor een zo krachtig mogelijke bevordering van de economische ontwikkeling der landen zonder zeekust zouden alle Staten, op basis van wederkerigheid, die landen vrije en onbelemmerde doorgang dienen te verlenen, en wel op zodanige wijze dat zij onder alle omstandigheden en voor alle soorten van goederen vrije toegang hebben tot de regionale en internationale handel. Transitogoederen zouden niet onderworpen mogen zijn aan douanerechten. In het transitoverkeer gebruikte transportmiddelen zouden niet onderworpen mogen zijn aan hogere heffingen of lasten dan die, welke voor het gebruik van transportmiddelen van het land van doorvoer worden geheven.  *Beginsel V*  De doorvoerstaat heeft het recht, met behoud van de volledige soevereiniteit over zijn grondgebied, alle maatregelen te nemen die nodig zijn ter verzekering dat de uitoefening van het recht van vrije en onbelemmerde doorvoer op generlei wijze inbreuk maakt op zijn rechtmatige belangen, onverschillig van welke aard deze zijn.  *Beginsel VI*  Het sluiten van regionale en andere internationale overeenkomsten dient door alle Staten te worden aangemoedigd, ten einde de ontwikkeling van een universele benadering van de oplossing der speciale en bijzondere vraagstukken verband houdende met de handel en de ontwikkeling van landen zonder zeekust in de verschillende delen van de wereld te versnellen.  *Beginsel VII*  De aan landen zonder zeekust met het oog op hun bijzondere geografische ligging verleende faciliteiten en bijzondere rechten vallen niet onder de werking van de meestbegunsitigingsclausule.  *Beginsel VIII*  De beginselen die het recht van vrije toegang tot de zee van de Staat zonder zeekust regelen, stellen op geen enkele wijze tussen twee of meer der Verdragsluitende Partijen bestaande overeenkomsten ter zake van deze vraagstukken terzijde, noch vormen zij een belemmering voor het sluiten van dergelijke overeenkomsten in de toekomst, mits deze overeenkomsten geen regeling inhouden die minder gunstig is dan, of in strijd is met de bovengenoemde bepalingen, Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  1  

####Definities

In dit Verdrag wordt verstaan onder: 

(a) „Staat zonder zeekust” - een Verdragsluitende Staat die geen zeekust heeft;  

(b) „transitoverkeer” - de doorvoer van goederen met inbegrip van losse bagage over het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Staat tussen een Staat zonder zeekust en de zee, indien de doorvoer een onderdeel is van een volledige reis die begint of eindigt op het grondgebied van die Staat zonder zeekust, en mede vervoer omvat over zee, hetzij rechtstreeks voorafgaand aan, hetzij rechtstreeks volgend op de doorvoer. Overlading, opslag, lossing en verandering in de wijze van vervoer van die goederen, alsmede het monteren, demonteren of opnieuw monteren van machines en andere grote stukken heeft niet tot gevolg dat de doorvoer der goederen buiten de definitie van „transitoverkeer” valt, mits dergelijke handelwijzen er uitsluitend op zijn gericht het vervoer te vergemakkelijken. Het in deze paragraaf bepaalde mag niet zodanig worden uitgelegd als zou een Verdragsluitende Staat verplicht zijn ten behoeve van dit monteren, demonteren of opnieuw monteren een vaste outillage op zijn grondgebied te vestigen of de vestiging daarvan toe te staan;  

(c) „doorvoerstaat” - een Verdragsluitende Staat al dan niet met een zeekust, gelegen tussen een Staat zonder zeekust en de zee, over wiens grondgebied transitoverkeer plaatsvindt;  

(d) „transportmiddelen”: 

(i) spoorwagons, zee- en binnenschepen en vrachtwagens;  

(ii) dragers en lastdieren, voor zover de plaatselijke situatie het gebruik daarvan gebiedt;  

(iii) andere transportmiddelen, pijpleidingen voor het vervoer van olie en gas, indien daarover tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staten overeenstemming is bereikt voor zover deze worden gebruikt voor transitoverkeer in de zin van dit artikel.      

### Artikel  2  

####Vrijheid van doorvoer

1.  Vrijheid van doorvoer wordt onder de in dit Verdrag gestelde voorwaarden verleend voor transito-verkeer en transportmiddelen. Met inachtneming van de andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag dienen de door de Verdragsluitende Staten genomen maatregelen tot regeling en bevordering van het verkeer over hun grondgebied, het transitoverkeer over wederzijds voor de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staten voor doorvoer aanvaardbare in gebruik zijnde routes te vergemakkelijken. In overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag mag geen discriminatie worden uitgeoefend met betrekking tot de plaats van oorsprong of afzending, noch ten aanzien van de plaatsen van binnenkomst en uitgang, of ten aanzien van bestemming of van de omstandigheden verband houdende met de eigendom van de goederen of de eigendom, de plaats van registratie dan wel de nationaliteit van schepen, voertuigen voor vervoer over land of andere gebruikte transportmiddelen.   
2.  De regels met betrekking tot het gebruik van transportmiddelen, wanneer deze een deel van of het gehele grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat doortrekken, warden vastgesteld in gemeenschappelijk overleg tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Staten, met inachtneming van de multilaterale verdragen waarbij deze Staten partij zijn.   
3.  De Verdragsluitende Staten verlenen, overeenkomstig hun wetten en andere voorschriften, machtiging voor de doorgang over, of de toegang tot hun grondgebied aan personen voor wie dat noodzakelijk is in verband met het transito-verkeer.   
4.  De Verdragsluitende Staten staan die doorgang van transitoverkeer over hun territoriale wateren toe overeenkomstig de beginselen van het gebruikelijke internationale recht of de toepasselijke internationale verdragen, alsmede overeenkomstig hun nationale regelingen.   

### Artikel  3  

####Douanerechten en bijzondere doorvoerrechten

Transito-verkeer wordt door de autoriteiten in de doorvoerstaat niet onderworpen aan douanerechten of heffingen die wegens in- of uitvoer worden geheven, noch aan andere bijzondere rechten verband houdende met de doorvoer. Op transito-verkeer mogen echter wel rechten worden geheven die uitsluitend zijn bedoeld ter bestrijding van de kosten van toezicht en administratie verbonden aan die doorvoer. Het bedrag van deze kosten moet zo veel mogelijk in overeenstemming zijn met de kosten die ermede moeten worden bestreden en dient met inachtneming van die voorwaarde in overeenstemming met de in artikel 2, eerste lid, gestelde eis van non-discriminatie te worden geheven.  

### Artikel  4  

####Transportmiddelen en tarieven

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten nemen de verplichting op zich, voor zover mogelijk, op de plaatsen van binnenkomst en uitgang en, indien nodig, op plaatsen van overlading, te zorgen voor behoorlijke transportmiddelen en apparatuur voor het verwerken van het transito-verkeer zonder onnodige vertraging.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten nemen de verplichting op zich ten aanzien van het transito-verkeer dat gebruik maakt van faciliteiten die door de Staat worden geëxploiteerd of beheerd, tarieven toe te passen of lasten op te leggen die, met inachtneming van de omstandigheden waaronder het verkeer plaatsvindt en van de op dit gebied bestaande concurrentie, redelijk zijn zowel wat betreft de hoogte van de tarieven of de lasten als de wijze waarop zij worden toegepast of opgelegd. Deze tarieven of lasten dienen zodanig te worden vastgesteld dat zij het transito-verkeer zo veel mogelijk vergemakkelijken en mogen niet hoger zijn dam de tarieven of lasten die door de Verdragsluitende Staten worden toegepast of opgelegd voor het vervoer over hun grondgebied van goederen komend uit landen die toegang hebben tot de zee. Het in dit lid bepaalde is mede van toepassing op de tarieven en lasten die worden toegepast en opgelegd ten aanzien van het transito-verkeer dat gebruik maakt van faciliteiten die worden geëxploiteerd of beheerd door bedrijven of personen, Ingeval deze tarieven of lasten worden vastgesteld door, of onderworpen zijn aan het toezicht van de Verdragsluitende Staat. De in dit lid gebruikte term „faciliteiten” omvat transportmiddelen, havenwerken en wegen, voor het gebruik waarvan tarieven worden toegepast of lasten worden geheven.   
3.  Sleepdiensten die een monopolie bezitten op voor doorvoer gebruikte waterwegen dienen zodanig te zijn georganiseerd dat zij de doorvaart van schepen niet belemmeren.   
4.  De bepalingen van dit artikel dienen te worden toegepast met inachtneming van het in artikel 2, eerste lid, bepaalde inzake non-discriminatie.   

### Artikel  5  

####Methoden en documenten betreffende douaneformaliteiten, vervoer, enz.

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten passen met betrekking tot de administratie en de douaneformaliteiten maatregelen toe die een vrij, onbelemmerd en ononderbroken transito-verkeer mogelijk maken. Zo nodig, dienen zij onderhandelingen te voeren ten einde overeenstemming te bereiken ten aanzien van maatregelen welke deze doorvoer waarborgen en vergemakkelijken.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten nemen de verplichting op zich gebruik te maken van eenvoudige documenten en van methoden die een snelle afwikkeling mogelijk maken van de formaliteiten verband houdende met de douane, het vervoer en andere administratieve procedures die betrekking hebben op transito-verkeer en wel voor de gehele doorvoerreis over hun grondgebied met inbegrip van eventuele overlading, opslag, lossing en veranderingen in de wijze van vervoer tijdens die reis.   

### Artikel  6  

####Opslag van doorvoergoederen

1.  De voorwaarden verbonden aan de opslag van doorvoergoederen op de plaats van binnenkomst en van uitgang en op tussenliggende plaatsen in de doorvoerstaat kunnen bij onderlinge overeenstemming door de betrokken Staten worden opgesteld. De door de doorvoerstaten aan de opslag te verbinden voorwaarden zijn ten minste even gunstig als die welke zij daaraan verbinden ten aanzien van goederen die uit hun eigen land komen of daarheen onderweg zijn.   
2.  De tarieven en heffingen worden vastgesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 4.   

### Artikel  7  

####Vertragingen of moeilijkheden bij transito-verkeer

1.  Behoudens ingeval van overmacht, worden door de Verdragsluitende Staten alle mogelijke maatregelen genomen om vertragingen of belemmeringen van het transito-verkeer te vermijden.   
2.  Indien zich vertragingen of andere moeilijkheden voordoen bij het transito-verkeer, spannen de bevoegde autoriteiten van de doorvoerstaat of -staten en die van de Staat onder zeekust zich gezamenlijk in om die ten spoedigste uit de weg te ruimen.   

### Artikel  8  

####Vrije zones of andere douanefaciliteiten

1.  Ten behoeve van het transito-verkeer kunnen, indien daarover tussen de doorvoerstaten en de Staten zonder zeekust onderling overeenstemming is bereikt in de havens van binnenkomst en uitgang vrije zones worden vastgesteld of andere douanefaciliteiten worden verleend.   
2.  Faciliteiten van deze aard kunnen ook worden verleend ten behoeve van Staten zonder zeekust in andere doorvoerstaten die geen zeekust of zeehavens hebben.   

### Artikel  9  

####Bepalingen inzake verdergaande faciliteiten

Aan dit Verdrag is de intrekking van doorvoerfaciliteiten die verder gaan dan die waarin dit Verdrag voorziet en waaromtrent, onder met de beginselen daarvan strokende voorwaarden, tussen Verdragsluitende Staten overeenstemming is bereikt, of die door een der Verdragsluitende Staten zijn verleend, volstrekt niet verbonden. Evenmin sluit dit Verdrag het verlenen van dergelijke verdergaande faciliteiten in de toekomst uit.  

### Artikel  10  

####Verhouding tot meestbegunstigingsclausule

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zijn het er over eens dat de meestbegunstigingsclausule niet van toepassing is op de faciliteiten en bijzondere rechten die bij dit Verdrag aan Staten zonder zeekust worden verleend vanwege hun bijzondere geografische ligging. Een Staat zonder zeekust die geen partij bij dit Verdrag is, kan op de krachtens dit Verdrag aan Staten zonder zeekust verleende faciliteiten en bijzondere rechten uitsluitend aanspraak maken op basis van de meestbegunstigingsclausule van een verdrag tussen die Staat zonder zeekust en de Verdragsluitende Staat welke die faciliteiten en bijzondere rechten verleent.   
2.  Indien een Verdragsluitende Staat aan een Staat zonder zeekust faciliteiten of bijzondere rechten verleent die verder gaan dan die waarin dit Verdrag voorziet, kunnen deze faciliteiten of bijzondere rechten worden beperkt tot die Staat zonder zeekust, tenzij het onthouden van die verder gaande faciliteiten of bijzondere rechten aan een andere Staat zonder zeekust in strijd is met de meestbegunstigingsclausule van een verdrag tussen die Staat zonder zeekust en de Verdragsluitende Staat welke die faciliteiten of bijzondere rechten verleent.   

### Artikel  11  

####Uitzonderingen op het Verdrag in verband met de volksgezondheid, de veiligheid en de bescherming van de intellectuele eigendom

1.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zijn op grond van dit Verdrag niet verplicht doorgang te verlenen aan personen wie de toegang tot hun grondgebied is verboden of met betrekking tot goederen die behoren tot een soort waarvan de invoer is verboden, hetzij op gronden ontleend aan de goede zeden, de volksgezondheid of de openbare veiligheid, hetzij als voorzorgsmaatregel tegen ziekten of plagen van dieren en planten.   
2.  De Verdragsluitende Staten zijn gerechtigd redelijke voorzorgen en maatregelen te nemen ten einde zeker te stellen dat personen en goederen, in het bijzonder goederen die door een monopoliestelsel worden getroffen, werkelijk doorgevoerd worden en dat de transportmiddelen werkelijk worden gebruikt voor het doorvoeren van die goederen, alsmede ter beveiliging der wegen en communicatiemiddelen.   
3.  Dit Verdrag doet geen afbreuk aan de maatregelen tot het treffen waarvan een verzoek tot een Verdragsluitende Staat kan worden gericht op grond van bepalingen in een algemeen internationaal verdrag, hetzij van wereldomvattende, hetzij van regionale aard, waarbij die Staat partij is, onverschillig of dat verdrag op het tijdstip van sluiting van dit Verdrag reeds was gesloten, dan wel later gesloten wordt, voor zover die bepalingen verband houden met: 

(a) de uitvoer, invoer of doorvoer van bijzondere soorten van artikelen zoals narcotica, of andere gevaarlijke verdovende middelen of wapens;  

(b) de bescherming van industriële, literaire of artistieke eigendom, bescherming van handelsnamen, aanduidingen van de herkomst of benamingen van de oorsprong, en de bestrijding van oneerlijke concurrentie.     
4.  Dit Verdrag belet een Verdragsluitende Staat niet de maatregelen te nemen die hij nodig acht ter bescherming van zijn belangen de essentiële veiligheid betreffende.   

### Artikel  12  

####Uitzonderingen in noodgevallen

De maatregelen van algemene of bijzondere aard die een Verdragsluitende Staat gedwongen is te nemen indien zich een noodtoestand voordoet waardoor zijn politiek bestaan of zijn veiligheid in gevaar worden gebracht, kunnen in uitzonderingsgevallen en voor een zo kort mogelijk tijdvak tot afwijking van het in dit Verdrag bepaalde nopen, met dien verstande dat aan het beginsel van de vrijheid van doorvoer gedurende dat tijdvak zo veel mogelijk zal worden vastgehouden.  

### Artikel  13  

####Toepassing van het Verdrag in oorlogstijd

In dit Verdrag worden de rechten en plichten van oorlogvoerende en neutrale staten in oorlogstijd niet vastgelegd. Het Verdrag blijft echter in tijd van oorlog van kracht voor zover die rechten en plichten zulks toelaten.  

### Artikel  14  

####Uit het Verdrag voortvloeiende verplichtingen en rechten en plichten van leden der Verenigde Naties

Dit Verdrag legt een Verdragsluitende Staat geen verplichting op die strijdig is met zijn rechten en plichten als lid der Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  15  

####Wederkerigheid

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag worden toegepast op basis van wederkerigheid.  

### Artikel  16  

####De regeling van geschillen

1.  Indien met betrekking tot de uitleg of de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag een geschil zou rijzen, dat niet binnen negen maanden door onderhandeling of andere vreedzame middelen wordt geregeld, wordt dit, op verzoek van een der partijen, aan arbitrage onderworpen. De arbitragecommissie bestaat uit drie leden. Elk der partijen bij het geschil benoemt één lid van de commissie, terwijl het derde lid, dat als voorzitter optreedt, in gemeenschappelijk overleg tussen partijen wordt gekozen. Indien partijen niet binnen drie maanden overeenstemming bereiken over de aanwijzing van het derde lid, wordt het derde lid benoemd door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof. Indien een der partijen niet binnen drie maanden het door haar te benoemen lid aanwijst, wordt door de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof in de vacature of vacatures voorzien.   
2.  De arbitragecommissie beslist over de aan haar oordeel onderworpen zaken bij gewone meerderheid van stemmen en haar beslissingen zijn bindend voor partijen.   
3.  Arbitragecommissies of andere internationale lichamen, belast met de regeling van geschillen die uit dit Verdrag voortvloeien, geven, door tussenkomst van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, de andere Verdragsluitende Staten kennis van het bestaan en de aard der geschillen en van de wijze waarop zij zijn geregeld.   

### Artikel  17
