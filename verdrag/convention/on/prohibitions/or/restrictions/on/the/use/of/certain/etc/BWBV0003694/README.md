##Verdrag inzake het verbod of de beperking van het gebruik van bepaalde conventionele wapens die geacht kunnen worden buitensporig leed te veroorzaken of een niet-onderscheidende werking te hebben

####Convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects

The High Contracting Parties, Recalling that every State has the duty, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to refrain in its international relations from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Further recalling the general principle of the protection of the civilian population against the effects of hostilities, Basing themselves on the principle of international law that the right of the parties to an armed conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited, and on the principle that prohibits the employment in armed conflicts of weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering, Also recalling that it is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment, Confirming their determination that in cases not covered by this Convention and its annexed Protocols or by other international agreements, the civilian population and the combatants shall at all times remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience, Desiring to contribute to international detente, the ending of the arms race and the building of confidence among States, and hence to the realization of the aspiration of all peoples to live in peace, Recognizing the importance of pursuing every effort which may contribute to progress towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, Reaffirming the need to continue the codification and progressive development of the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, Wishing to prohibit or restrict further the use of certain conventional weapons and believing that the positive results achieved in this area may facilitate the main talks on disarmament with a view to putting an end to the production, stockpiling and proliferation of such weapons, Emphasizing the desirability that all States become parties to this Convention and its annexed Protocols, especially the militarily significant States, Bearing in mind that the General Assembly of the United Nations and the United Nations Disarmament Commission may decide to examine the question of a possible broadening of the scope of the prohibitions and restrictions contained in this Convention and its annexed Protocols, Further bearing in mind that the Committee on Disarmament may decide to consider the question of adopting further measures to prohibit or restrict the use of certain conventional weapons,   Have agreed as follows:

####Verdrag inzake het verbod of de beperking van het gebruik van bepaalde conventionele wapens die geacht kunnen worden buitensporig leed te veroorzaken of een niet-onderscheidende werking te hebben

De Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, In herinnering brengend, dat iedere Staat, overeenkomstig het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties, de plicht heeft zich in zijn internationale betrekkingen te onthouden van bedreiging met of gebruik van geweld, gericht tegen de soevereiniteit, de territoriale integriteit of de politieke onafhankelijkheid van een Staat, dan wel plaatsvindend op enige andere wijze, die onverenigbaar is met de doelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties, Voorts herinnerend aan het algemene beginsel dat de burgerbevolking tegen de gevolgen van vijandelijkheden dient te worden beschermd, Zich baserend op het volkenrechtelijke beginsel dat het recht van de partijen bij een gewapend conflict ten aanzien van de keuze der methoden of middelen van oorlogvoering niet onbegrensd is, en op het beginsel dat het verboden is in gewapende conflicten wapens, projectielen en stoffen alsmede methoden van oorlogvoering te gebruiken, die naar hun aard overbodig letsel of onnodig leed veroorzaken, Voorts eraan herinnerend dat het verboden is methoden of middelen van oorlogvoering te gebruiken, bestemd om omvangrijke, langdurige en ernstige schade aan het natuurlijke milieu toe te brengen, of die dergelijke schade naar kan worden verwacht, zullen toebrengen, Hun vastbeslotenheid bevestigend dat in gevallen waarin niet wordt voorzien door dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen, of door andere internationale overeenkomsten, de burgerbevolking en de combattanten te allen tijde beschermd blijven door en onderworpen blijven aan de beginselen van het volkenrecht, die voortvloeien uit de gevestigde gebruiken, de beginselen van menselijkheid en de eisen van het algemene rechtsbewustzijn, Verlangend bij te dragen tot de internationale ontspanning, de beëindiging van de bewapeningswedloop en het wekken van vertrouwen tussen Staten, en aldus tot de verwezenlijking van het streven van alle volken in vrede te leven, Erkennend dat het van belang is alles te doen wat kan bijdragen tot vorderingen in de richting van algemene en volledige ontwapening onder strikt en doeltreffend internationaal toezicht, Opnieuw de noodzaak bevestigend voort te gaan met de codificatie en geleidelijke ontwikkeling van de regels van het volkenrecht, toepasselijk in geval van gewapende conflicten, Geleid door de wens het gebruik van bepaalde conventionele wapens te verbieden of verder te beperken, en ervan overtuigd dat de op dit terrein geboekte positieve resultaten de algemene ontwapeningsbesprekingen met het oogmerk een einde te maken aan de produktie, de opslag en de verspreiding van zulke wapens, kunnen vergemakkelijken, De nadruk leggend op de wenselijkheid dat alle Staten partij worden bij dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen, vooral de militair belangrijke Staten, Indachtig het feit dat de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties en de Ontwapeningscommissie van de Verenigde Naties kunnen besluiten een mogelijke verruiming te bestuderen van het toepassingsgebied van de verboden en beperkingen, vervat in dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen, Voorts indachtig het feit dat de Ontwapeningscommissie kan besluiten de aanvaarding te overwegen van verdere maatregelen tot verbod of beperking van het gebruik van bepaalde conventionele wapens, <sup> 1)  Hier is bedoeld de Geneefse Ontwapeningscommissie.  </sup>   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  1  

####Toepassingsgebied

1.  Dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen zijn van toepassing in de situaties bedoeld in de artikelen 2 van de Verdragen van Genève van 12 augustus 1949 voor de bescherming van oorlogsslachtoffers, met inbegrip van de situaties zoals beschreven in artikel 1, vierde lid, van Aanvullend Protocol I bij deze Verdragen.   
2.  Dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen zijn tevens van toepassing, in aanvulling op de situaties bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, op situaties bedoeld in de artikelen 3 van de Verdragen van Genève van 12 augustus 1949. Dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen zijn niet van toepassing op situaties van binnenlandse onlusten en spanningen, zoals ongeregeldheden, geïsoleerde en sporadische geweldplegingen en andere soortgelijke daden die geen gewapende conflicten zijn.   
3.  In geval van gewapende conflicten van niet-internationale aard die zich voordoen op het grondgebied van een van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen, is elke partij bij het conflict gehouden de verboden en beperkingen van dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen toe te passen.   
4.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag of van de daaraan gehechte Protocollen wordt ingeroepen met het oog op de aantasting van de soevereiniteit van een Staat of de verantwoordelijkheid van de regering om, met alle wettige middelen, de openbare orde in de Staat te handhaven of te herstellen of de nationale eenheid en territoriale integriteit van de Staat te verdedigen.   
5.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag of van de daaraan gehechte Protocollen wordt ingeroepen ter rechtvaardiging van rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks ingrijpen, op welke gronden dan ook, in het gewapend conflict of in de nationale of internationale aangelegenheden van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan dat conflict zich voordoet.   
6.  De toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag en van de daaraan gehechte Protocollen op partijen bij een conflict die geen Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn en die dit Verdrag of de daaraan gehechte Protocollen hebben aanvaard, wijzigt, noch expliciet noch impliciet, hun juridische status of de juridische status van een betwist grondgebied.   
7.  De bepalingen van het tweede tot en met het zesde lid van dit artikel doen geen afbreuk aan aanvullende Protocollen die na 1 januari 2002 worden aangenomen en waarvan de werkingssfeer met betrekking tot dit artikel kan worden toegepast, uitgesloten of gewijzigd.   

### Artikel  2  

####Verhouding tot andere internationale overeenkomsten

Geen enkele bepaling in dit Verdrag of de daaraan gehechte Protocollen mag zo worden uitgelegd als zou daardoor afbreuk worden gedaan aan andere verplichtingen, die de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn opgelegd door het internationaal humanitairrecht dat van toepassing is in gewapende conflicten.

Indien echter aan het einde van dat jaar de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die opzegt, is verwikkeld in een situatie, zoals bedoeld in artikel 1, blijft de Partij gebonden door de verplichtingen van dit Verdrag en van de desbetreffende aangehechte Protocollen tot het einde van het gewapende conflict of de bezetting, en in elk geval, tot de beëindiging van de verrichtingen in verband met de definitieve vrijlating, repatriëring of nieuwe vestiging van de personen die worden beschermd door de in gewapende conflicten toepasselijke regels van het volkenrecht, en in het geval van een aangehecht Protocol dat bepalingen bevat betreffende situaties waarin het bewaren van de vrede, het verrichten van waarnemingen of soortgelijke taken worden verricht door strijdkrachten of missies van de Verenigde Naties in het betrokken gebied, tot de beëindiging van die taken.   
3.  Elke opzegging van dit Verdrag wordt beschouwd tevens te gelden voor alle aangehechte Protocollen waardoor de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die opzegt, is gebonden.   
4.  Een opzegging geldt alleen ten aanzien van de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die opzegt.   
5.  Geen enkele opzegging tast, met betrekking tot welke handeling ook die is verricht voordat de opzegging van kracht wordt, verplichtingen aan die ten gevolge van een gewapend conflict krachtens dit Verdrag en de daaraan gehechte Protocollen reeds rusten op de Hoge Verdragsluitende Partij die opzegt.
