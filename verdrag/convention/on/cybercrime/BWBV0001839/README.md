####Convention on Cybercrime

Preamble The member States of the Council of Europe and the other States signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members; Recognising the value of fostering co-operation with the other States parties to this Convention; Convinced of the need to pursue, as a matter of priority, a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, *inter alia,* by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation; Conscious of the profound changes brought about by the digitalisation, convergence and continuing globalisation of computer networks; Concerned by the risk that computer networks and electronic information may also be used for committing criminal offences and that evidence relating to such offences may be stored and transferred by these networks; Recognising the need for co-operation between States and private industry in combating cybercrime and the need to protect legitimate interests in the use and development of information technologies; Believing that an effective fight against cybercrime requires increased, rapid and well-functioning international co-operation in criminal matters; Convinced that the present Convention is necessary to deter action directed against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems, networks and computer data as well as the misuse of such systems, networks and data by providing for the criminalisation of such conduct, as described in this Convention, and the adoption of powers sufficient for effectively combating such criminal offences, by facilitating their detection, investigation and prosecution at both the domestic and international levels and by providing arrangements for fast and reliable international co-operation; Mindful of the need to ensure a proper balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental human rights as enshrined in the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other applicable international human rights treaties, which reaffirm the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and the rights concerning the respect for privacy; Mindful also of the right to the protection of personal data, as conferred, for example, by the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data; Considering the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1999 International Labour Organization Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention; Taking into account the existing Council of Europe conventions on co-operation in the penal field, as well as similar treaties which exist between Council of Europe member States and other States, and stressing that the present Convention is intended to supplement those conventions in order to make criminal investigations and proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data more effective and to enable the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence; Welcoming recent developments which further advance international understanding and co-operation in combating cybercrime, including action taken by the United Nations, the OECD, the European Union and the G8; Recalling Committee of Ministers Recommendations No. R (85) 10 concerning the practical application of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters in respect of letters rogatory for the interception of telecommunications, No. R (88) 2 on piracy in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights, No. R (87) 15 regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, No. R (95) 4 on the protection of personal data in the area of telecommunication services, with particular reference to telephone services, as well as No. R (89) 9 on computer-related crime providing guidelines for national legislatures concerning the definition of certain computer crimes and No. R (95) 13 concerning problems of criminal procedural law connected with information technology; Having regard to Resolution No. 1 adopted by the European Ministers of Justice at their 21st Conference (Prague, 10 and 11 June 1997), which recommended that the Committee of Ministers support the work on cybercrime carried out by the European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC) in order to bring domestic criminal law provisions closer to each other and enable the use of effective means of investigation into such offences, as well as to Resolution No. 3 adopted at the 23rd Conference of the European Ministers of Justice (London, 8 and 9 June 2000), which encouraged the negotiating parties to pursue their efforts with a view to finding appropriate solutions to enable the largest possible number of States to become parties to the Convention and acknowledged the need for a swift and efficient system of international co-operation, which duly takes into account the specific requirements of the fight against cybercrime; Having also regard to the Action Plan adopted by the Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe on the occasion of their Second Summit (Strasbourg, 10 and 11 October 1997), to seek common responses to the development of the new information technologies based on the standards and values of the Council of Europe; Have agreed as follows:

a) This article applies to extradition between Parties for the criminal offences established in accordance with Articles 2 through 11 of this Convention, provided that they are punishable under the laws of both Parties concerned by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of at least one year, or by a more severe penalty.  

b) Where a different minimum penalty is to be applied under an arrangement agreed on the basis of uniform or reciprocal legislation or an extradition treaty, including the European Convention on Extradition (ETS No. 24), applicable between two or more parties, the minimum penalty provided for under such arrangement or treaty shall apply.     
2.  The criminal offences described in paragraph 1 of this article shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between or among the Parties. The Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty to be concluded between or among them.   
3.  If a Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another Party with which it does not have an extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition with respect to any criminal offence referred to in paragraph 1 of this article.   
4.  Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognise the criminal offences referred to in paragraph 1 of this article as extraditable offences between themselves.

Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their investigations and proceedings in the same manner as for any other offence of a comparable nature under the law of that Party.   
7.  

a) Each Party shall, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, communicate to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe the name and address of each authority responsible for making or receiving requests for extradition or provisional arrest in the absence of a treaty.

### TITLE  3  

####GENERAL PRINCIPLES RELATING TO MUTUAL ASSISTANCE

### Article  25  

####General principles relating to mutual assistance

1.  The Parties shall afford one another mutual assistance to the widest extent possible for the purpose of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.   
2.  Each Party shall also adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to carry out the obligations set forth in Articles 27 through 35.   
3.  Each Party may, in urgent circumstances, make requests for mutual assistance or communications related thereto by expedited means of communication, including fax or e-mail, to the extent that such means provide appropriate levels of security and authentication (including the use of encryption, where necessary), with formal confirmation to follow, where required by the requested Party. The requested Party shall accept and respond to the request by any such expedited means of communication.   
4.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in articles in this chapter, mutual assistance shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested Party or by applicable mutual assistance treaties, including the grounds on which the requested Party may refuse co-operation. The requested Party shall not exercise the right to refuse mutual assistance in relation to the offences referred to in Articles 2 through 11 solely on the ground that the request concerns an offence which it considers a fiscal offence.   
5.  Where, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the requested Party is permitted to make mutual assistance conditional upon the existence of dual criminality, that condition shall be deemed fulfilled, irrespective of whether its laws place the offence within the same category of offence or denominate the offence by the same terminology as the requesting Party, if the conduct underlying the offence for which assistance is sought is a criminal offence under its laws.   

### Article  26  

####Spontaneous information

1.  A Party may, within the limits of its domestic law and without prior request, forward to another Party information obtained within the framework of its own investigations when it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving Party in initiating or carrying out investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences established in accordance with this Convention or might lead to a request for co-operation by that Party under this chapter.   
2.  Prior to providing such information, the providing Party may request that it be kept confidential or only used subject to conditions. If the receiving Party cannot comply with such request, it shall notify the providing Party, which shall then determine whether the information should nevertheless be provided. If the receiving Party accepts the information subject to the conditions, it shall be bound by them.

R (85) 10 inzake de praktische toepassing van het Europees Verdrag inzake wederzijdse bijstand in strafzaken met betrekking tot rogatoire commissies voor het aftappen van telecommunicatie, Nr.

####Uitlevering

1.  

a. Dit artikel is van toepassing op uitlevering tussen Partijen voor de overeenkomstig de artikelen 2 tot en met 11 van dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten, mits deze ingevolge de wetten van beide betrokken Partijen strafbaar zijn gesteld met een vrijheidsstraf met een maximale duur van ten minste een jaar, of met een zwaardere straf.  

b. Wanneer een andere minimumstraf vereist is op grond van een tussen twee of meer Partijen van toepassing zijnd uitleveringsverdrag, daaronder begrepen het Europees Verdrag betreffende uitlevering (ETS Nr. 24), of op grond van een regeling die berust op uniforme of wederkerige wetgeving, is de in dat verdrag of die regeling voorziene minimumstraf van toepassing.     
2.  De in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde strafbare feiten worden geacht in elk tussen de Partijen bestaand uitleveringsverdrag te zijn begrepen als voor uitlevering vatbaar feit. De Partijen verplichten zich ertoe deze strafbare feiten als zodanig op te nemen in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
3.  Indien een Partij de uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag en zij een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Partij waarmee zij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft, kan zij dit Verdrag beschouwen als rechtsbasis voor uitlevering wegens ieder in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoeld strafbaar feit.   
4.  De Partijen die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoelde strafbare feiten onderling als voor uitlevering vatbare feiten.   
5.  Uitlevering is onderworpen aan de voorwaarden, opgenomen in de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij of in de toepasselijke uitleveringsverdragen, met inbegrip van de gronden waarop de aangezochte Partij de uitlevering kan weigeren.   
6.  Indien uitlevering voor een in het eerste lid van dit artikel bedoeld strafbaar feit wordt geweigerd uitsluitend op grond van de nationaliteit van de gezochte persoon, of omdat de aangezochte Partij met betrekking tot dit feit rechtsmacht meent te hebben, draagt de aangezochte Partij de zaak op verzoek van de verzoekende Partij ter vervolging over aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten, en deelt zij de afloop van de zaak te gelegener tijd mee aan de verzoekende Partij. De betrokken autoriteiten nemen hun beslissing en voeren het onderzoek en de procedure uit op dezelfde wijze als voor elk ander strafbaar feit van vergelijkbare aard, overeenkomstig de wetgeving van die Partij.   
7.  

a. Iedere Partij deelt, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa de naam en het adres mede van iedere autoriteit die verantwoordelijk is voor de indiening of de ontvangst van een verzoek om uitlevering of voorlopige arrestatie, voor het geval er geen verdrag van toepassing is.  

b. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa stelt een register op van de aldus door de Partijen aangewezen autoriteiten en houdt dit bij. Iedere Partij draagt er zorg voor dat de in het register vermelde gegevens te allen tijde juist zijn.     

### TITEL  3  

####ALGEMENE BEGINSELEN MET BETREKKING TOT WEDERZIJDSE BIJSTAND

### Artikel  25  

####Algemene beginselen met betrekking tot wederzijdse bijstand

1.  De Partijen verlenen elkaar een zo ruim mogelijke bijstand ten behoeve van onderzoeken of procedures betreffende strafbare feiten die verband houden met computersystemen en -gegevens, of ten behoeve van de vergaring van bewijs in elektronische vorm van een strafbaar feit.   
2.  Iedere Partij neemt de wetgevende en andere maatregelen die nodig zijn om de in de artikelen 27 tot en met 35 genoemde verplichtingen na te komen.   
3.  Iedere Partij kan in dringende omstandigheden een verzoek doen inzake wederzijdse bijstand of om daarover in contact te treden, met behulp van snelle communicatiemiddelen, zoals fax of e-mail, voorzover deze middelen voldoende mogelijkheid van beveiliging en authenticatie (waaronder, indien nodig, het gebruik van encryptie) bieden, met nadien de mogelijkheid van officiële bevestiging, indien de aangezochte Partij zulks verlangt. De aangezochte Partij accepteert het verzoek en beantwoordt dit met behulp van een van deze snelle communicatiemiddelen.   
4.  Behoudens voorzover uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald in de artikelen van dit hoofdstuk, is de wederzijdse bijstand onderworpen aan de voorwaarden voorzien in het nationale recht van de aangezochte Partij of in de toepasselijke rechtshulpverdragen, met inbegrip van de gronden waarop de aangezochte Partij samenwerking kan weigeren. De aangezochte Partij oefent het recht van weigering van wederzijdse bijstand met betrekking tot de in de artikelen 2 tot en met 11 bedoelde strafbare feiten niet uit op grond van het enkele feit dat het verzoek betrekking heeft op een overtreding die zij als van fiscale aard beschouwt.   
5.  Wanneer het de aangezochte Partij, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk, is toegestaan wederzijdse bijstand afhankelijk te maken van het bestaan van dubbele strafbaarheid, wordt aan deze voorwaarde geacht te zijn voldaan indien de gedraging die ten grondslag ligt aan het strafbare feit waarvoor om bijstand wordt verzocht, in haar wetgeving wordt aangemerkt als strafbaar feit, ongeacht of het interne recht het strafbare feit al dan niet in dezelfde categorie plaatst of met dezelfde termen aanduidt als het recht van de verzoekende Partij.   

### Artikel  26  

####Informatieverstrekking op eigen initiatief

1.  Een Partij kan, binnen de grenzen van haar nationale recht en zonder voorafgaand verzoek, in het kader van haar eigen onderzoek verkregen inlichtingen aan een andere Partij verstrekken wanneer zij van oordeel is dat de verstrekking van deze inlichtingen de ontvangende Partij kan helpen bij het instellen of uitvoeren van onderzoeken of strafvervolgingen ter zake van de krachtens dit Verdrag strafbaar gestelde feiten, of kan leiden tot een verzoek om samenwerking van die Partij in de zin van dit hoofdstuk.   
2.  Voorafgaand aan het verstrekken van deze inlichtingen kan de verstrekkende Partij verzoeken dat deze vertrouwelijk wordt behandeld of uitsluitend onder bepaalde voorwaarden wordt gebruikt. Indien de ontvangende Partij aan een dergelijk verzoek niet kan voldoen, stelt zij de verstrekkende Partij daarvan in kennis, die vervolgens bepaalt of de inlichtingen niettemin moeten worden verstrekt. Indien de ontvangende Partij de inlichtingen onder deze voorwaarden aanvaardt, is zij aan deze voorwaarden gebonden.   

### TITEL  4  

####PROCEDURES INZAKE VERZOEKEN OM WEDERZIJDSE BIJSTAND BIJ GEBREKE VAN TOEPASSELIJKE INTERNATIONALE OVEREENKOMSTEN

### Artikel  27  

####Procedures inzake verzoeken om wederzijdse bijstand bij gebreke van toepasselijke internationale overeenkomsten

1.  Wanneer tussen de verzoekende en de aangezochte Partij geen verdrag inzake wederzijdse bijstand noch een regeling op basis van uniforme of wederkerige wetgeving van kracht is, zijn de bepalingen van het tweede tot en met het negende lid van dit artikel van toepassing. Zij zijn niet van toepassing wanneer een dergelijk verdrag, of een dergelijke regeling of wetgeving bestaat, tenzij de betrokken Partijen overeenkomen in plaats daarvan de rest van dit artikel of een gedeelte daarvan toe te passen.   
2.  

a. Iedere Partij wijst een of meer centrale autoriteiten aan die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het verzenden en beantwoorden van verzoeken om wederzijdse bijstand, voor de uitvoering van deze verzoeken of voor de doorzending ervan naar de voor de uitvoering bevoegde autoriteiten.  

b. De centrale autoriteiten onderhouden rechtstreeks contact met elkaar.  

c. Iedere Partij deelt, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding, de Secretaris-Generaal de namen en adressen mede van de uit hoofde van dit lid aangewezen autoriteiten.  

d. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa stelt een register op van de door de Partijen aangewezen centrale autoriteiten en houdt dit bij. Iedere Partij zorgt ervoor dat de in het register vermelde gegevens te allen tijde juist zijn.     
3.  Verzoeken om wederzijdse bijstand uit hoofde van dit artikel worden uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met de door de verzoekende Partij aangegeven procedure, behalve wanneer deze onverenigbaar is met de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij.   
4.  De aangezochte Partij kan, onverminderd de in artikel 25, vierde lid, bedoelde voorwaarden of gronden voor weigering, bijstand weigeren: 

a. indien het verzoek een strafbaar feit betreft dat door de aangezochte Partij wordt aangemerkt als een politiek delict of als een strafbaar feit dat verband houdt met een politiek delict, of  

b. indien zij van oordeel is dat de inwilliging van het verzoek het risico in zich draagt van aantasting van haar soevereiniteit, haar veiligheid, haar openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen.     
5.  De aangezochte Partij kan de uitvoering van het verzoek opschorten indien daardoor de door haar autoriteiten ingestelde strafrechtelijke onderzoeken of procedures zouden worden geschaad.   
6.  Voordat de aangezochte Partij bijstand weigert of opschort beziet zij, waar dienstig na overleg met de verzoekende Partij, of zij gedeeltelijk of onder de door haar nodig geachte voorwaarden aan het verzoek kan voldoen.   
7.  De aangezochte Partij brengt de verzoekende Partij onverwijld op de hoogte van het resultaat van de uitvoering van het verzoek om bijstand. Iedere weigering van het verzoek of opschorting van de uitvoering wordt met redenen omkleed. De aangezochte Partij brengt de verzoekende Partij tevens op de hoogte van de redenen die de uitvoering van het verzoek om bijstand onmogelijk maken of mogelijk aanzienlijk zullen vertragen.   
8.  De verzoekende Partij kan de aangezochte Partij verzoeken het feit dat een verzoek ingevolge dit hoofdstuk is gedaan alsmede het voorwerp daarvan vertrouwelijk te houden, behoudens voor zover dat voor de uitvoering van het verzoek niet mogelijk is. Indien de aangezochte Partij niet aan het verzoek om vertrouwelijkheid kan voldoen, brengt zij onverwijld de verzoekende Partij hiervan op de hoogte, die vervolgens bepaalt of het verzoek niettemin moet worden uitgevoerd. <sup> 1)  Noot vertaler: Dit is anders dan wat er in de Engelse/Franse tekst staat, omdat de bedoeling duidelijk is dat de aangezochte partij het verzoek niet geheim hoeft te houden als dat in verband met de uitvoering niet mogelijk is.  </sup>   
9.  

a. In dringende gevallen kunnen de gerechtelijke autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij de verzoeken om rechtshulp of daarop betrekking hebbende mededelingen rechtstreeks richten aan de gerechtelijke autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij. In een dergelijk geval wordt tegelijkertijd door tussenkomst van de centrale autoriteit van de verzoekende Partij een afschrift gezonden aan de centrale autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij.  

b. Verzoeken of mededelingen overeenkomstig dit lid kunnen worden gedaan door tussenkomst van de International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol).  

c. Wanneer een verzoek gedaan is overeenkomstig onderdeel a van dit lid en de benaderde autoriteit niet bevoegd is om het verzoek te behandelen, zal deze het verzoek doorzenden naar de bevoegde nationale autoriteit en de verzoekende Partij daarvan rechtstreeks op de hoogte stellen.  

d. Overeenkomstig dit lid gedane verzoeken of mededelingen, die geen toepassing van dwangmiddelen vergen, kunnen door de bevoegde autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij rechtstreeks worden toegezonden aan de bevoegde autoriteiten van de aangezochte Partij.  

e. Iedere Partij kan, op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding, de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa mededelen dat, om redenen van doelmatigheid, de ingevolge dit lid gedane verzoeken aan haar centrale autoriteit moeten worden gericht.     

### Artikel  28  

####Geheimhouding en beperking van gebruik

1.  Wanneer tussen de verzoekende en de aangezochte Partij geen verdrag inzake wederzijdse bijstand noch een regeling op basis van uniforme of wederkerige wetgeving van kracht is, zijn de bepalingen van dit artikel van toepassing. Zij zijn niet van toepassing wanneer een dergelijk verdrag of een dergelijke regeling of wetgeving wel bestaat, tenzij de betrokken Partijen overeenkomen in plaats daarvan de rest van dit artikel of een gedeelte daarvan toe te passen.   
2.  De aangezochte Partij kan aan de verstrekking van informatie of materiaal in antwoord op een verzoek de voorwaarde verbinden dat: 

a. de informatie of het materiaal geheim wordt gehouden in het geval dat aan het verzoek om wederzijdse bijstand bij gebreke van een dergelijke voorwaarde niet kan worden voldaan, of  

b. de informatie of het materiaal niet wordt gebruikt voor andere onderzoeken of procedures dan in het verzoek vermeld.     
3.  Indien de verzoekende Partij niet kan voldoen aan een in het tweede lid bedoelde voorwaarde, brengt zij onverwijld de andere Partij hiervan op de hoogte, die vervolgens bepaalt of de informatie niettemin moet worden verstrekt. Indien de verzoekende Partij de voorwaarde aanvaardt, is zij hieraan gebonden.   
4.  Iedere Partij die informatie of materiaal verstrekt waarvoor een in het tweede lid bedoelde voorwaarde geldt, kan van de andere Partij, met betrekking tot die voorwaarde, nadere uitleg verlangen omtrent het gebruik dat van deze informatie of van dit materiaal is gemaakt.

####SPECIFIEKE BEPALINGEN

### TITEL  1  

####WEDERZIJDSE BIJSTAND MET BETREKKING TOT VOORLOPIGE MAATREGELEN

### Artikel  29  

####Spoedbewaring van opgeslagen computergegevens

1.  Een Partij kan een andere Partij verzoeken de spoedbewaring te bevelen of op soortgelijke wijze de spoedbewaring te bewerkstelligen van gegevens die zijn opgeslagen door middel van een computersysteem dat zich bevindt op het grondgebied van die andere Partij en ten aanzien waarvan de verzoekende Partij voornemens is een verzoek om wederzijdse bijstand in te dienen voor het doorzoeken van, het zich op vergelijkbare wijze toegang verschaffen tot, het in beslag nemen of op vergelijkbare wijze zekerstellen van of het verstrekken van de bedoelde gegevens.   
2.  In een verzoek om vastlegging ingevolge het eerste lid wordt het volgende vermeld: 

a. de autoriteit die om de bewaring verzoekt;  

b. het strafbare feit waarop het strafrechtelijk onderzoek of de strafvervolging betrekking heeft en een korte uiteenzetting van de daarop betrekking hebbende feiten;  

c. de opgeslagen computergegevens die moeten worden bewaard en de relatie hiervan met het strafbare feit;  

d. alle beschikbare informatie die het mogelijk maakt de beheerder van de opgeslagen computergegevens te identificeren of de locatie van het computersysteem te achterhalen;  

e. de noodzaak van de bewaring; en  

f. het feit dat de Partij voornemens is een verzoek om wederzijdse bijstand in te dienen voor het doorzoeken van, het zich op vergelijkbare wijze verschaffen van toegang tot, het in beslag nemen, het op vergelijkbare wijze zekerstellen of het verstrekken van de opgeslagen computergegevens.     
3.  Na ontvangst van het verzoek van een andere Partij, neemt de aangezochte Partij alle passende maatregelen om over te gaan tot de spoedbewaring van de vermelde gegevens, in overeenstemming met haar nationale recht. Om aan een verzoek te voldoen mag dubbele strafbaarheid niet worden vereist als voorwaarde voor zodanige bewaring.   
4.  Een Partij die dubbele strafbaarheid vereist als voorwaarde voor het voldoen aan een verzoek om wederzijdse bijstand voor het doorzoeken van, het zich op vergelijkbare wijze verschaffen van toegang tot, het inbeslagnemen, het op vergelijkbare wijze zekerstellen of het verstrekken van de gegevens kan, ten aanzien van andere feiten dan die welke overeenkomstig de artikelen 2 tot en met 11 van dit Verdrag strafbaar zijn gesteld, zich het recht voorbehouden het verzoek om bewaring ingevolge dit artikel te weigeren wanneer zij redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat op het tijdstip van de verstrekking niet aan de voorwaarde van dubbele strafbaarheid kan worden voldaan.   
5.  Daarnaast kan een verzoek om vastlegging alleen worden geweigerd indien: 

a. het verzoek een strafbaar feit betreft dat door de aangezochte Partij wordt aangemerkt als een politiek delict of een strafbaar feit dat verband houdt met een politiek delict, of  

b. de aangezochte Partij van oordeel is dat de inwilliging van het verzoek het risico in zich draagt van aantasting van haar soevereiniteit, haar veiligheid, haar openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen.     
6.  Wanneer de aangezochte Partij van mening is dat de bewaring de toekomstige beschikbaarheid van de gegevens niet waarborgt of de vertrouwelijkheid van het onderzoek van de verzoekende Partij in gevaar brengt of het onderzoek van de verzoekende Partij anderszins schaadt, brengt zij de verzoekende Partij hiervan terstond op de hoogte, die vervolgens bepaalt of het verzoek niettemin moet worden uitgevoerd.   
7.  Iedere bewaring die wordt gerealiseerd in antwoord op een verzoek als bedoeld in het eerste lid, blijft gehandhaafd gedurende een termijn van ten minste 60 dagen, teneinde de verzoekende Partij in de gelegenheid te stellen een verzoek in te dienen voor het doorzoeken van, het zich op vergelijkbare wijze toegang verschaffen tot, het in beslag nemen of op vergelijkbare wijze zekerstellen van of het verstrekken van de gegevens. Na de ontvangst van een dergelijk verzoek blijft de bewaring van de gegevens gehandhaafd in afwachting van een beslissing op het verzoek.   

### Artikel  30  

####Spoedverstrekking van vastgelegde verkeersgegevens

1.  Wanneer, bij de uitvoering van een verzoek ingevolge artikel 29 tot bewaring van verkeersgegevens met betrekking tot een specifiek berichtenverkeer, de aangezochte Partij ontdekt dat een serviceprovider in een andere Staat betrokken was bij de doorgifte van dat bericht, verstrekt de aangezochte Partij aan de verzoekende Partij ten spoedigste een zodanige hoeveelheid verkeersgegevens dat kan worden bepaald welke serviceprovider dat is en langs welke route het berichtenverkeer heeft plaatsgevonden.   
2.  De verstrekking van verkeersgegevens uit hoofde van het eerste lid mag alleen worden geweigerd: 

a. indien het verzoek een strafbaar feit betreft dat door de aangezochte Partij wordt aangemerkt als een politiek delict of als een strafbaar feit dat verband houdt met een politiek delict, of  

b. indien de aangezochte Partij van oordeel is dat de inwilliging van het verzoek het risico in zich draagt van aantasting van haar soevereiniteit, haar veiligheid, haar openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen.

####Wederzijdse bijstand op het gebied van de onderschepping van inhoudgegevens

De Partijen verlenen elkaar wederzijdse bijstand bij het in „real-time" vergaren of vastlegging van gegevens inzake de inhoud van specifiek berichtenverkeer dat door middel van een computersysteem wordt overgedragen, voor zover toegestaan overeenkomstig de voor hun toepasselijke verdragen en nationale wetten.

1.  Een federale Staat kan zich het recht voorbehouden de verplichtingen ingevolge hoofdstuk II van dit Verdrag aan te gaan voor zover deze in overeenstemming zijn met zijn fundamentele beginselen die ten grondslag liggen aan de betrekkingen tussen zijn centrale regering en de constituerende Staten of andere vergelijkbare territoriale entiteiten, mits hij in staat blijft op basis van hoofdstuk III samen te werken.   
2.  Wanneer een federale Staat een voorbehoud ingevolge het eerste lid maakt, kan hij de formulering van dit voorbehoud niet aanwenden om zijn in hoofdstuk II bedoelde verplichtingen uit te sluiten of wezenlijk te verminderen.

### Artikel  43  

####Status en intrekking van voorbehouden

1.  Een Partij die overeenkomstig artikel 42 een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt, kan dit geheel of ten dele intrekken door middel van een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa gerichte kennisgeving. Deze intrekking wordt van kracht op de datum van ontvangst van deze kennisgeving door de Secretaris-Generaal.
