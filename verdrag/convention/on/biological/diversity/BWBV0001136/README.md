####Verdrag inzake biologische diversiteit

Preambule De Verdragsluitende Partijen, Zich bewust van de intrinsieke waarde van de biologische diversiteit en van de waarde van de biologische diversiteit en de bestanddelen daarvan in ecologisch, genetisch, sociaal, economisch, wetenschappelijk, educatief, cultureel, recreatief en esthetisch opzicht, Zich tevens bewust van het belang van de biologische diversiteit voor de evolutie en het behoud van de systemen die de biosfeer in stand houden, Bevestigende dat het behoud van de biologische diversiteit een gemeenschappelijke zorg voor de mensheid vormt, Opnieuw bevestigende dat Staten soevereine rechten hebben met betrekking tot hun biologische rijkdommen, Tevens opnieuw bevestigende dat Staten verantwoordelijk zijn voor het behoud van hun biologische diversiteit en voor het duurzame gebruik van hun biologische rijkdommen, Bezorgd over het feit dat de biologische diversiteit aanmerkelijk achteruitgaat door bepaalde menselijke activiteiten, Zich bewust van de in het algemeen tekortschietende informatie en kennis aangaande de biologische diversiteit en van de dringende behoefte aan de ontwikkeling van wetenschappelijke, technische en institutionele mogelijkheden waarmee het fundamentele inzicht kan worden verworven dat nodig is om passende maatregelen te kunnen plannen en uitvoeren, Vaststellende dat het van het hoogste belang is de oorzaken van de aanmerkelijke achteruitgang of verlies van de biologische diversiteit te voorzien, te voorkomen en aan te pakken bij de bron, Tevens vaststellende dat wanneer er een aanmerkelijke achteruitgang of verlies van de biologische diversiteit dreigt, het ontbreken van volledige wetenschappelijke zekerheid niet mag dienen als grond voor uitstel van maatregelen ter voorkoming of beperking van die dreiging, Voorts vaststellende dat het voornaamste vereiste voor het behoud van de biologische diversiteit bestaat in het behoud in situ van ecosystemen en natuurlijke habitats, alsmede in de instandhouding en het herstel van levensvatbare populaties van soorten in hun natuurlijke omgeving, Eveneens vaststellende dat maatregelen ex situ, bij voorkeur in het land van oorsprong, ook van groot belang zijn, Erkennende dat veel autochtone en plaatselijke gemeenschappen van oudsher hoogst afhankelijk zijn van biologische rijkdommen, waarop hun tradities zijn gebaseerd, en dat het wenselijk is de voordelen van de toepassing van traditionele kennis, vernieuwingen en gebruiken betreffende het behoud van de biologische diversiteit en het duurzame gebruik van bestanddelen daarvan, eerlijk te delen, Tevens erkennende de vitale rol die vrouwen spelen in het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van de biologische diversiteit, en bevestigende de noodzaak van de volledige deelneming van vrouwen op alle niveaus van de beleidsvorming en -uitvoering ter zake van het behoud van de biologische diversiteit, Onderstrepende het belang en de noodzaak van het bevorderen van internationale, regionale en mondiale samenwerking tussen Staten en intergouvernementele organisaties en de niet-gouvernementele sector met het oog op het behoud van de biologische diversiteit en het duurzame gebruik van bestanddelen daarvan, Erkennende dat het verschaffen van nieuwe en aanvullende financiële middelen en passende toegang tot relevante technologieën van aanzienlijke invloed zou kunnen zijn op de mate waarin de wereld in staat is het verlies van de biologische diversiteit tegen te gaan, Voorts erkennende dat bijzondere maatregelen noodzakelijk zijn om te voorzien in de behoeften van ontwikkelingslanden, waaronder het verschaffen van nieuwe en aanvullende financiële middelen en passende toegang tot relevante technologieën, Wijzende in dit verband op de bijzondere omstandigheden van de minst ontwikkelde landen en kleine eilandstaten, Erkennende dat voor het behoud van de biologische diversiteit aanzienlijke investeringen zijn vereist, waarvan een breed scala van voordelen op milieu-, economisch en sociaal gebied mogen worden verwacht, Erkennende dat economische en sociale ontwikkeling en de uitroeiing van armoede de eerste en allerhoogste prioriteiten zijn van ontwikkelingslanden, Beseffende dat het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van de biologische diversiteit van het hoogste belang is om te kunnen voorzien in de behoeften qua voeding en gezondheid en andere behoeften van de groeiende wereldbevolking, waarvoor de toegang tot en het delen van zowel genetische rijkdommen als technologieën essentieel is, Vaststellende dat uiteindelijk het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van de biologische diversiteit de vriendschappelijke betrekkingen tussen Staten zullen versterken en zullen bijdragen tot vrede voor de mensheid, Geleid door de wens bestaande internationale regelingen voor het behoud van de biologische diversiteit en het duurzame gebruik van bestanddelen daarvan te verbeteren en aan te vullen, en Vastbesloten de biologische diversiteit te behouden en duurzaam te gebruiken ten behoeve van huidige en toekomstige generaties, Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:
