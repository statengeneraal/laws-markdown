##Verdrag betreffende beperking van gevallen van meervoudige nationaliteit en betreffende militaire verplichtingen in geval van meervoudige nationaliteit

####Convention on reduction of cases of multiple nationality and military obligations in cases of multiple nationality

The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto, Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity between its Members; Considering that cases of multiple nationality are liable to cause difficulties and that joint action to reduce as far as possible the number of cases of multiple nationality, as between member States, corresponds to the aims of the Council of Europe; Considering it desirable that persons possessing the nationality of two or more Contracting Parties should be required to fulfil their military obligations in relation to one of those Parties only,   Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####Reduction of cases of multiple nationality

### Article  1  

1.  Nationals of the Contracting Parties who are of full age and who acquire of their own free will, by means of naturalisation, option or recovery, the nationality of another Party shall lose their former nationality. They shall not be authorised to retain their former nationality.   
2.  Nationals of the Contracting Parties who are minors and acquire by the same means the nationality of another Party shall also lose their former nationality if, where their national law provides for the loss of nationality in such cases, they have been duly empowered or represented. They shall not be authorised to retain their former nationality.   
3.  Minor children, other than those who are or have been married, shall likewise lose their former nationality in the event of the acquisition *ipso jure* of the nationality of another Contracting Party upon and by reason of the naturalisation or the exercise of an option or the recovery of nationality by their father and mother. Where only one parent loses his former nationality, the law of that Contracting Party whose nationality the minor possessed shall determine from which of his parents he shall derive his nationality. In the latter case, the said law may make the loss of his nationality subject to the prior consent of the other parent or the guardian to his acquiring the new nationality. However, without prejudice to the provisions of the law of each of the Contracting Parties concerning the recovery of nationality, the Party of which the minor referred to in the foregoing paragraph possessed the nationality may lay down special conditions on which they may recover that nationality of their own free will after attaining their majority.   
4.  In so far as concerns the loss of nationality as provided for in the present Article, the age of majority and minority and the conditions of capacity and representation shall be determined by the law of the Contracting Party whose nationality the person concerned possesses.   
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and, where applicable, 2 above, where a national of a Contracting Party acquires the nationality of another Contracting Party on whose territory either he was born and is resident, or has been ordinarily resident for a period of time beginning before the age of 18, each of these Parties may provide that he retains the nationality of origin.   
6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and, where applicable, 2 and 5 above, in cases of marriage between nationals of different Contracting Parties, each of these Parties may provide that the spouse, who acquires of his or her own free will the nationality of the other spouse, retains the nationality of origin.   
7.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 above, where applicable, when a national of a Contracting Party who is a minor and whose parents are nationals of different Contracting Parties acquires the nationality of one of his parents, each of these Parties may provide that he retains the nationality of origin.   

### Article  2  

1.  A person who possesses the nationality of two or more Contracting Parties may renounce one or more of these nationalities, with the consent of the Contracting Party whose nationality he desires to renounce.   
2.  Such consent may not be withheld by the Contracting Party whose nationality a person of full age possesses ipso jure provided that the said person has his ordinary residence outside the territory of that Party. Consent may likewise not be withheld by the Contracting Party in the case of minors who fulfil the conditions stipulated in the preceding paragraph, provided that their national law allows them to give up their nationality by means of a simple declaration and provided also that they have been duly empowered or represented.   
3.  The age of majority and minority and the conditions for being empowered or represented shall be determined by the law of the Contracting Party whose nationality the person in question desires to renounce.   

### Article  3  

The Contracting Party whose nationality a person desires to renounce shall not require the payment of any special tax or charge in the event of such renunciation.  

### Article  4  

Nothing in the provisions of this Convention shall preclude the application of any provision more likely to limit the occurrence of multiple nationality whether embodied or subsequently introduced into either the municipal law of any Contracting Party or any other treaty, convention or agreement between two or more of the Contracting Parties.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####Military obligations in cases of multiple nationality

### Article  5  

1.  Persons possessing the nationality of two or more Contracting Parties shall be required to fulfil their militairy obligations in relation to one of those Parties only.   
2.  The modes of application of paragraph 1 may be determined by special agreements between any of the Contracting Parties.   

### Article  6  

Except where a special agreement which has been, or may be, concluded provides otherwise, the following provisions are applicable to a person possessing the nationality of two or more Contracting Parties: 

1. Any such person shall be subject to military obligations in relation to the Party in whose territory he is ordinarily resident. Nevertheless, he shall be free to choose, up to the age of 19 years, to submit himself to military obligations as a volunteer in relation to any other Party of which he is also a national for a total and effective period at least equal to that of the active military service required by the former Party.  

2. A person who is ordinarily resident in the territory of a Contracting Party of which he is not a national or in that of a State which is not a Party may choose to perform his military service in the territory of any Contracting Party of which he is a national.  

3. A person who, in accordance with the rules laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2, shall fulfil his military obligations in relation to one Contracting Party, as prescribed by the law of that Party, shall be deemed to have fulfilled his military obligations in relation to any other Party or Parties of which he is also a national. The same shall apply to a person who has been relieved of or exempted from his military obligations or has fulfilled civil service as an alternative. A person who is a national of a Contracting Party which does not require obligatory military service, shall be considered as having satisfied his military obligations when he has his ordinary residence in the territory of that Party. Nevertheless he should be deemed not to have satisfied his military obligations in relation to a Contracting Party or Contracting Parties of which he is equally a national and where military service is required unless the said ordinary residence has been maintained up to a certain age, which each Contracting Party concerned shall notify at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession. Also a person who is a national of a Contracting Party which does not require obligatory military service shall be considered as having satisfied his military obligations when he has enlisted voluntarily in the military forces of that Party for a total and effective period which is at least equal to that of the active military service of the Contracting Party or Contracting Parties of which he is also a national without regard to where he has his ordinary residence.  

4. A person who, before the entry into force of this Convention between the Parties of which he is a national, has, in relation to one of those Parties, fulfilled his military obligations in accordance with the law of that Party, shall be deemed to have fulfilled the same obligations in relation to any other Party or Parties of which he is also a national.  

5. A person who, in conformity with paragraph 1, has performed his active military service in relation to one of the Contracting Parties of which he is a national, and subsequently transfers his ordinary residence to the territory of the other Party of which he is a national, shall be liable to military service in the reserve only in relation to the latter Party.  

6. The application of this Article shall not prejudice, in any respect, the nationality of the persons concerned.  

7. In the event of mobilisation by any Party, the obligations arising under this Article shall not be binding upon that Party.    

### CHAPTER  III  

####Application of the Convention

### Article  7  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall apply the provisions of Chapters I and II. It is however understood that each Contracting Party may declare, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, that it will apply the provisions of Chapter I or Chapter II only. It may, at any subsequent time, notify the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that it will apply all provisions of Chapters I and II. Such notification takes effect from the date of its reception.   
2.  The provisions of Chapter I or II, as the case may be, shall be applicable only between Contracting Parties which apply the chapter in question.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####Final clauses

### Article  8  

1.  Any Contracting Party may, when signing this Convention or depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, declare that it avails itself of one or more of the reservations provided for in the Annex to the present Convention. No other reservation shall be permitted.   
2.  Any Contracting Party may wholly or partly withdraw a reservation it has made in accordance with the foregoing paragraph by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, which shall become effective as from the date of its receipt.   
3.  A Contracting Party which has made a reservation in respect of any provision of the Convention in accordance with this Article may not claim application of the said provision by another Party; it may, however, if its reservation is partial or conditional claim the application of that provision in so far as it has itself accepted it.   

### Article  9  

1.  Any Contracting Party may, by a declaration made to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe on signature or on depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, or at any subsequent time, with regard to States and territories for which it assumes international responsibility, or for which it is empowered to contract, define the term “nationals” and specify the “territories” to which the present Convention shall be applicable.   
2.  Any declaration made in accordance with this Article may, in respect of the nationals and territories mentioned in such declaration, be withdrawn according to the procedure laid down in Article 12 of this Convention.   

### Article  10  

1.  This Convention shall be open to signature by the member States of the Council of Europe. It shall be subject to ratification or acceptance. Instruments of ratification or acceptance shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.   
2.  This Convention shall enter into force one month after the date of deposit of the second instrument of ratification or acceptance.

2.  vervallen;   

3. to allow any of its nationals to retain his previous nationality if a Contracting Party for whose nationality he applies in the manner referred to in Article 1 gives its prior consent thereto.     

####Verdrag betreffende beperking van gevallen van meervoudige nationaliteit en betreffende militaire verplichtingen in geval van meervoudige nationaliteit

De Lid-Staten van de Raad van Europa, die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Overwegende, dat de Raad van Europa tot doel heeft een grotere eenheid tussen zijn Leden tot stand te brengen; Overwegende, dat meervoudige nationaliteit een bron van moeilijkheden vormt en dat een gezamenlijk streven om de gevallen van meervoudige nationaliteit die zich tussen de Lid-Staten voordoen, zoveel mogelijk te beperken, beantwoordt aan het door de Raad van Europa nagestreefde doel; Overwegende, dat het wenselijk is, dat personen die de nationaliteit van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen bezitten, hun militaire verplichtingen jegens één van die partijen behoeven na te komen;   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Beperking van gevallen van meervoudige nationaliteit

### Artikel  1  

1.  Meerderjarige onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen verliezen hun nationaliteit, indien zij ten gevolge van een uitdrukkelijke wilsverklaring de nationaliteit van een andere Partij verkrijgen door naturalisatie, optie of herstel in die nationaliteit; aan hen mag geen vergunning worden gegeven hun vroegere nationaliteit te behouden.   
2.  Indien zij op dezelfde wijze de nationaliteit van een andere Partij verkrijgen, verliezen minderjarige onderdanen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen eveneens hun nationaliteit, mits hun nationale wet in die mogelijkheid voorziet en de omtrent bevoegdheid of vertegenwoordiging gestelde regels in acht zijn genomen; aan hen mag geen vergunning worden verleend hun vroegere nationaliteit te behouden.   
3.  Met uitzondering van hen die gehuwd zijn of gehuwd geweest zijn, verliezen eveneens hun nationaliteit minderjarige kinderen die op het tijdstip en ten gevolge van de naturalisatie, de optie of het herstel in de nationaliteit van hun vader en moeder, van rechtswege de nationaliteit van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij verkrijgen. Wanneer slechts één van de ouders zijn nationaliteit verliest, bepaalt de wet van die Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan de minderjarige de nationaliteit bezat, wie van zijn ouders hij in de nationaliteit zal volgen. In dit laatste geval kan die wet het verlies van de nationaliteit laten afhangen van de instemming van de andere ouder of van de wettelijke vertegenwoordiger met de verkrijging van de nieuwe nationaliteit. Evenwel kan, zonder inbreuk te maken op de bepalingen van de wet van elk der Verdragsluitende Partijen met betrekking tot de herkrijging van de nationaliteit, de Partij waarvan de minderjarigen bedoeld in de voorgaande alinea de nationaliteit hebben bezeten, bijzondere regels stellen, krachtens welke zij, na het bereiken van de meerderjarigheid, die nationaliteit door een uitdrukkelijke wilsverklaring kunnen herkrijgen.   
4.  Wat betreft het verlies van nationaliteit als bedoeld in dit artikel wordt door de wet van de Verdragsluitende Partij, waarvan de betrokkene de nationaliteit bezit, bepaald wat onder meerderjarigheid en minderjarigheid dient te worden verstaan, alsmede welke eisen aan bevoegdheid en vertegenwoordiging zijn te stellen.   
5.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het eerste lid en, waar van toepassing, het tweede lid, kan elk van deze Partijen, wanneer een onderdaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij de nationaliteit verkrijgt van een andere Verdragsluitende Partij op het grondgebied waarvan hij is geboren en verblijft, of zijn gewone verblijf heeft gehad gedurende een tijdvak dat aanvangt voor de leeftijd van 18 jaar, bepalen dat hij de oorspronkelijke nationaliteit behoudt.   
6.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het eerste lid en, waar van toepassing, het tweede en het vijfde lid, kan elk van deze Partijen, in geval van een huwelijk tussen onderdanen van verschillende Verdragsluitende Partijen, bepalen dat de echtgenoot die door een uitdrukkelijke wilsverklaring de nationaliteit van de andere echtgenoot verkrijgt, de oorspronkelijke nationaliteit behoudt.   
7.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van het tweede lid, waar van toepassing, kan elk van deze Partijen, wanneer een minderjarige onderdaan van een Verdragsluitende Partij wiens ouders onderdanen van verschillende Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn, de nationaliteit van een van zijn ouders verkrijgt, bepalen dat hij de oorspronkelijke nationaliteit behoudt.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Hij die de nationaliteit van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen bezit, kan van één of meer van die nationaliteiten afstand doen, mits de Verdragsluitende Partij van welker nationaliteit hij afstand wenst te doen, daarin toestemt.   
2.  Die toestemming mag niet worden geweigerd door de Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan een meerderjarige de nationaliteit van rechtswege bezit, indien hij zijn gewoon verblijf heeft buiten het grondgebied van die Partij. Evenmin mag toestemming worden geweigerd door de Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan een minderjarige onderdaan voldoet aan de voorwaarden bedoeld in de voorgaande alinea mits zijn nationale wet hem toestaat door een eenvoudige verklaring zijn nationaliteit te verliezen en de omtrent bevoegdheid of vertegenwoordiging gestelde regels in acht zijn genomen.   
3.  Wat onder meerderjarigheid en minderjarigheid dient te worden verstaan, alsmede welke eisen aan bevoegdheid en vertegenwoordiging zijn te stellen, wordt bepaald door de wet van de Verdragsluitende Partij van welker nationaliteit de betrokken persoon afstand wenst te doen.   

### Artikel  3  

De Verdragsluitende Partij van welker nationaliteit de betrokken persoon afstand wenst te doen, verlangt daarvoor geen bijzonder recht of enige andere betaling.  

### Artikel  4  

De bepalingen van dit Verdrag laten onverlet de voor beperking van de gevallen van meervoudige nationaliteit gunstiger bepalingen, welke zijn of later mochten worden opgenomen, hetzij in de nationale wet van een Verdragsluitende Partij, hetzij in enig ander verdrag of enige andere overeenkomst gesloten tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Militaire verplichtingen in geval van meervoudige nationaliteit

### Artikel  5  

1.  Hij die de nationaliteit van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen bezit, behoeft zijn militaire verplichtingen slechts ten opzichte van één van die Partijen na te komen.   
2.  De wijze waarop uitvoering zal worden gegeven aan de bepaling van het eerste lid, kan bij bijzondere overeenkomsten tussen belanghebbende Verdragsluitende Partijen worden vastgesteld.   

### Artikel  6  

Voor zover bij bijzondere overeenkomsten welke zijn of zullen worden gesloten, geen andere voorzieningen zijn getroffen, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing op hem die de nationaliteit van twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen bezit. 

1. Hij is onderworpen aan de militaire verplichtingen jegens de Partij op welker grondgebied hij gewoonlijk verblijft. Evenwel staat het hem tot het bereiken van de leeftijd van 19 jaar vrij zich te onderwerpen aan de militaire verplichtingen jegens enige andere Partij waarvan hij eveneens de nationaliteit bezit, door het sluiten van een vrijwillige verbintenis tot werkelijke dienst voor een tijdvak waarvan de totale duur tenminste gelijk moet zijn aan die van de werkelijke militaire dienst bij de andere Partij.  

2. Hij die zijn gewoon verblijf heeft op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Partij waarvan hij geen onderdaan is, of op het grondgebied van een staat welke geen Partij is, heeft de vrijheid te kiezen bij welke van de Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit hij zijn militaire verplichtingen wenst te vervullen.  

3. Hij die overeenkomstig de regels vervat in het eerste of tweede lid aan zijn militaire verplichtingen jegens één Verdragsluitende Partij naar de eisen van de wet van die Partij heeft voldaan, wordt geacht te hebben voldaan aan de militaire verplichtingen ten opzichte van de Partij of Partijen waarvan hij eveneens onderdaan is. Dit geldt eveneens voor hem die van zijn militaire verplichtingen is vrijgesteld of vervangende burgerdienst heeft vervuld. Hij die onderdaan is van een Verdragsluitende Partij die geen militaire dienstplicht kent, wordt geacht zijn militaire verplichtingen te hebben vervuld indien hij zijn gewoon verblijf heeft op het grondgebied van die Partij. Niettemin dient hij te worden geacht niet zijn militaire verplichtingen te hebben vervuld jegens de Verdragsluitende Partij of Partijen waarvan hij eveneens onderdaan is en waar men wel militaire dienstplicht kent, tenzij bovenbedoeld gewoon verblijf heeft geduurd tot het bereiken van een bepaalde leeftijd die door iedere betrokken Verdragsluitende Partij dient te worden opgegeven bij ondertekening of bij nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of toetreding. Eveneens wordt hij die onderdaan is van een Verdragsluitende Partij die geen militaire dienstplicht kent, geacht zijn militaire verplichtingen te hebben vervuld, indien hij als vrijwilliger in militaire dienst van die Partij is geweest gedurende een totale werkelijke diensttijd die ten minste gelijk is aan de duur van de actieve militaire dienst van de Verdragsluitende Partij of Partijen waarvan hij eveneens onderdaan is, ongeacht waar hij zijn gewoon verblijf heeft.  

4. Hij die voordat dit Verdrag tussen de Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit van kracht is geworden, aan de militaire verplichtingen jegens één van die Partijen overeenkomstig de wet van die Partij heeft voldaan, wordt geacht te hebben voldaan aan diezelfde verplichtingen jegens de Partij of Partijen waarvan hij eveneens onderdaan is.  

5. Hij die overeenkomstig het bepaalde bij het eerste lid zijn werkelijke militaire dienst heeft vervuld jegens één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, en die later zijn gewoon verblijf overbrengt naar het grondgebied van de andere Partij waarvan hij de nationaliteit bezit, kan slechts jegens laatstgenoemde Partij worden onderworpen aan de militaire verplichtingen als grootverlofganger.  

6. De toepassing van de bepalingen van dit artikel beïnvloedt de nationaliteit van de betrokkenen in geen enkel opzicht.  

7. In geval van mobilisatie in één van de Verdragsluitende Partijen gelden de verplichtingen welke uit de bepalingen van dit artikel voortvloeien niet voor die Partij.    

### HOOFDSTUK  III

2.  Elke Verdragsluitende Partij kan een voorbehoud, gemaakt overeenkomstig het voorgaande lid, geheel of gedeeltelijk intrekken door een aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa gerichte mededeling, welke van kracht wordt op de datum van ontvangst.   
3.  Een Verdragsluitende Partij die overeenkomstig dit artikel gebruik heeft gemaakt van een voorbehoud ten aanzien van een bepaling van het Verdrag, kan geen aanspraak maken op de toepassing van die bepaling door een andere Partij.

2.  vervallen;   

3. aan ieder van zijn onderdanen toe te staan zijn vroegere nationaliteit te behouden, mits de Verdragsluitende Partij welker nationaliteit hij heeft aangevraagd op de in artikel 1 bedoelde wijze, daarin toestemt.
