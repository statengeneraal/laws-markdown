####Convention on International Liability for Damage caused by Space Objects

The States Parties to this Convention, Recognising the common interest of all mankind in furthering the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, Recalling the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, Taking into consideration that, notwithstanding the precautionary measures to be taken by States and international intergovernmental organisations involved in the launching of space objects, damage may on occasion be caused by such objects, Recognising the need to elaborate effective international rules and procedures concerning liability for damage caused by space objects and to ensure, in particular, the prompt payment under the terms of this Convention of a full and equitable measure of compensation to victims of such damage, Believing that the establishment of such rules and procedures will contribute to the strengthening of international co-operation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for paceful purposes,   Have agreed on the following:    

### Article  I  

For the purposes of this Convention: 

(a) The term “damage” means loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; or loss of or damage to property of tes or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organisations;  

(b) The term “launching” includes attempted launching;  

(c) The term “launching State” means: 

(i) a state which launches or procures the launching of a space object;  

(ii) a State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched;    

(d) The term, “space object” includes component parts of a space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof.    

### Article  II  

A launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight.  

### Article  III  

In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.  

### Article  IV  

1.  In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, and of damage thereby being caused to a third State or to its natural or juridical persons, the first two States shall be jointly and severally liable to the third State, to the extent indicated by the following: 

(a) If the damage has been caused to the third State on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight, their liability to the third State shall be absolute;  

(b) If the damage has been caused to a space object of the third State or to persons or property on board that space object elsewhere than on the surface of the earth, their liability to the third State shall be based on the fault of either of the first two States or on the fault of persons for whom either is responsible.     
2.  In all cases of joint and several liability referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the burden of compensation for the damage shall be apportioned between the first two States in accordance with the extent to which they were at fault; if the extent of the fault of each of these States cannot be established, the burden of compensation shall be apportioned equally between them. Such apportionment shall be without prejudice to the right of the third State to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.   

### Article  V  

1.  Whenever two or more States jointly launch a space object, they shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage caused.   
2.  A launching State which has paid compensation for damage shall have the right to present a claim for indemnification to other participants in the joint launching. The participants in a joint launching may conclude agreements regarding the apportioning among themselves of the financial obligation in respect of which they are jointly and severally liable. Such agreements shall be without prejudice to the right of a State sustaining damage to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.   
3.  A State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched shall be regarded as a participant in a joint launching.   

### Article  VI  

1.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, exoneration from absolute liability shall be granted to the extent that a launching State establishes that the damage has resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant State or of natural or juridical persons it represents.   
2.  No exoneration whatever shall be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching State which are not in conformity with international law including, in particular, the Charter of the United Nations and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.   

### Article  VII  

The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to damage caused by a space object of a launching State to: 

(a) nationals of that launching State;  

(b) foreign nationals during such time as they are participating in the operation of that space object from the time of its launching or at any stage thereafter until its descent, or during such time as they are in the immediate vicinity of a planned launching or recovery area as the result of an invitation by that launching State.    

### Article  VIII  

1.  A State which suffers damage, or whose natural or juridical persons suffer damage, may present to a launching State a claim for compensation for such damage.   
2.  If the State of nationality has not presented a claim, another State may, in respect of damage sustained in its territory by any natural or juridical person, present a claim to a launching State.   
3.  If neither the State of nationality nor the State in whose territory the damage was sustained has presented a claim or notified its intention of presenting a claim, another State may, in respect of damage sustained by its permanent residents, present a claim to a launching State.   

### Article  IX  

A claim for compensation for damage shall be presented to a launching State through diplomatic channels. If a State does not maintain diplomatic relations with the launching State concerned, it may request another State to present its claim to that launching State or otherwise represent its interests under this Convention. It may also present its claim through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, provided the claimant State and the launching State are both Members of the United Nations.  

### Article  X  

1.  A claim for compensation for damage may be presented to a launching State not later than one year following the date of the occurrence of the damage or the identification of the launching State which is liable.   
2.  If, however, a State does not know of the occurrence of the damage or has not been able to identify the launching State which is liable, it may present a claim within one year following the date on which it learned of the aforementioned facts; however, this period shall in no event exceed one year following the date on which the State could reasonably be expected to have learned of the facts through the exercise of due diligence.   
3.  The time-limits specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply even if the full extent of the damage may not be known. In this event, however, the claimant State shall be entitled to revise the claim and submit additional documentation after the expiration of such time-limits until one year after the full extent of the damage is known.   

### Article  XI  

1.  Presentation of a claim to a launching State for compensation for damage under this Convention shall not require the prior exhaustion of any local remedies which may be available to a claimant State or to natural or juridical persons it represents.   
2.  Nothing in this Convention shall prevent a State, or natural or juridical persons it might represent, from pursuing a claim in the courts or administrative tribunals or agencies of a launching State. A State shall not, however, be entitled to present a claim under this Convention in respect of the same damage for which a claim is being pursued in the courts or administrative tribunals or agencies of a launching State or under another international agreement which is binding on the States concerned.   

### Article  XII  

The compensation which the launching State shall be liable to pay for damage under this Convention shall be determined in accordance with the international law and the principles of justice and equity, in order to provide such reparation in respect of the damage as will restore the person, natural or juridical, State or international organisation on whose behalf the claim is presented to the condition which would have existed if the damage had not occurred.  

### Article  XIII  

Unless the claimant State and the State from which compensation is due under this Convention agree on another form of compensation, the compensation shall be paid in the currency of the claimant State or, if that State so requests, in the currency of the State from which compensation is due.  

### Article  XIV  

If no settlement of a claim is arrived at through diplomatic negotiations as provided for in Article IX, within one year from the date on which the claimant State notifies the launching State that it has submitted the documentation of its claim, the parties concerned shall establish a Claims Commission at the request of either party.  

### Article  XV  

1.  The Claims Commission shall be composed of three members: one appointed by the claimant State, one appointed by the launching State and the third member, the Chairman, to be chosen by both parties jointly. Each party shall make its appointment within two months of the request for the establishment of the Claims Commission.   
2.  If no agreement is reached on the choice of the Chairman within four months of the request for the establishment of the Commission, either party may request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint the Chairman within a further period of two months.   

### Article  XVI  

1.  If one of the parties does not make its appointment within the stipulated period, the Chairman shall, at the request of the other party, constitute a single-member Claims Commission.   
2.  Any vacancy which may arise in the Commission for whatever reason shall be filled by the same procedure adopted for the original appointment.   
3.  The Commission shall determine its own procedure.   
4.  The Commission shall determine the place or places where it shall sit and all other administrative matters.   
5.  Except in the case of decisions and awards by a single-member Commission, all decisions and awards of the Commission shall be by majority vote.   

### Article  XVII  

No increase in the membership of the Claims Commission shall lake place by reason of two or more claimant States or launching States being joined in any one proceeding before the Commission. The claimant States so joined shall collectively appoint one member of the Commission in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as would be the case for a single claimant State. When two or more launching States are so joined, they shall collectively appoint one member of the Commission in the same way. If the claimant States or the launching States do not make the appointment within the stipulated period, the Chairman shall constitute a single-member Commission.  

### Article  XVIII  

The Claims Commission shall decide the merits of the claim for compensation and determine the amount of compensation payable, if any.  

### Article  XIX  

1.  The Claims Commission shall act in accordance with the provisions of Article XII.   
2.  The decision of the Commission shall be final and binding if the parties have so agreed; otherwise the Commission shall render a final and recommendatory award, which the parties shall consider in good faith. The Commission shall state the reasons for its decision or award.   
3.  The Commission shall give its decision or award as promptly as possible and no later than one year from the date of its establishment, unless an extension of this period is found necessary by the Commission.   
4.  The Commission shall make its decision or award public. It shall deliver a certified copy of its decision or award to each of the parties and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   

### Article  XX  

The expenses in regard to the Claims Commission shall be borne equally by the parties, unless otherwise decided by the Commission.  

### Article  XXI  

If the damage caused by a space object presents a large-scale danger to human life or seriously interferes with the living conditions of the population or the functioning of vital centres, the States Parties, and in particular the launching State, shall examine the possibility of rendering appropriate and rapid assistance to the State which has suffered the damage, when it so requests. However, nothing in this Article shall affect the rights or obligations of the States Parties under this Convention.  

### Article  XXII  

1.  In this Convention, with the exception of Articles XXIV to XXVII, references to States shall be deemed to apply to any international intergovernmental organisation which conducts space activities if the organisation declares its acceptance of the rights and obligations provided for in this Convention and if a majority of the States members of the organisation are States Parties to this Convention and to the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.   
2.  States members of any such organisation which are States Parties to this Convention shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that the organisation makes a declaration in accordance with the preceding paragraph.   
3.  If an international intergovernmental organisation is liable for damage by virtue of the provisions of this Convention, that organisation and those of its members which are States Parties to this Convention shall be jointly and severally liable; provided, however, that: 

(a) any claim for compensation in respect of such damage shall be first presented to the organisation;  

(b) only where the organisation has not paid, within a period of six months, any sum agreed or determined to be due as compensation for such damage, the claimant State may invoke the liability of the members which are States Parties to this Convention for the payment of that sum.     
4.  Any claim, pursuant to the provisions of this Convention, for compensation in respect of damage caused to an organisation which has made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be presented by a State member of the organisation which is a State Party to this Convention.   

### Article  XXIII  

1.  The provisions of this Convention shall not affect other international agreements in force in so far as relations between the States Parties to such agreements are concerned.   
2.  No provision of this Convention shall prevent States from concluding international agreements reaffirming, supplementing or extending its provisions.

### 2777 (XXVI)  

####Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects

The General Assembly, Reaffirming the importance of international co-operation in the field of the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, and of promoting the law in this new field of human endeavour, Desiring that the rights and obligations pertaining to liability for damage as laid down in the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be elaborated in a separate international instrument, Recalling its resolutions 1963 (XVIII) of 13 December 1963, 2130 (XX) of 21 December 1965, 2222 (XXI) of 19 December 1966, 2345 (XXII) of 19 December 1967, 2453 B (XXIII) of 20 December 1968, 2601 B (XXIV) of 16 December 1969 and 2733 B (XXV) of 16 December 1970 concerning the elaboration of an agreement on the liability for damage caused by the launching of objects into outer space, Recalling also that in resolution 2733 B (XXV) it urged the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to reach early agreement on a draft convention on liability, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session, embodying the principles of a full measure of compensation to victims and effective procedures which would lead to prompt and equitable settlement of claims, Having considered the report of the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Taking note with appreciation of the work accomplished by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and in particular that of its Legal Sub-Committee,

4. Expresses its hope for the widest possible adherence to this Convention.     

####Overeenkomst inzake de internationale aansprakelijkheid voor schade veroorzaakt door ruimtevoorwerpen

De Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, Erkennende het gemeenschappelijk belang voor de gehele mensheid het onderzoek en het gebruik van de kosmische ruimte voor vreedzame doeleinden te bevorderen, In herinnering brengend het Verdrag inzake de beginselen waaraan de activiteiten van Staten zijn onderworpen bij het onderzoek en gebruik van de kosmische ruimte, met inbegrip van de maan en andere hemellichamen, Overwegende dat, ondanks de voorzorgsmaatregelen, te nemen door de Staten en de internationale intergouvernementele organisaties die zich bezighouden met de lancering van ruimtevoorwerpen, door zodanige voorwerpen mogelijkerwijze schade kan worden veroorzaakt, Erkennend dat het noodzakelijk is doeltreffende internationale regels en procedures op te stellen betreffende de aansprakelijkheid voor schade veroorzaakt door ruimtevoorwerpen en in het bijzonder de prompte betaling te verzekeren van een volledige en billijke schadevergoeding aan slachtoffers van zodanige schade overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, In de overtuiging dat de opstelling van zodanige regels en procedures zal bijdragen tot de versterking van de internationale samenwerking op het gebied van het onderzoek en het gebruik van de kosmische ruimte voor vreedzame doeleinden,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

In deze Overeenkomst wordt onder: 

(a) „schade” verstaan: overlijden, lichamelijk letsel of andere aantastingen van de gezondheid; verlies van of schade aan eigendommen van Staten of personen - hetzij natuurlijke personen, hetzij rechtspersonen - of eigendommen van internationale intergouvernementele organisaties;  

(b) „lancering”: mede begrepen de poging tot lancering;  

(c) „lancerende Staat” verstaan: 

(i) een Staat die een ruimtevoorwerp lanceert of doet lanceren;  

(ii) een Staat vanaf welks grondgebied of installatie een ruimtevoorwerp wordt gelanceerd;    

(d) „ruimtevoorwerp”: mede begrepen de samenstellende delen van een ruimtevoorwerp, alsmede zijn drager of delen daarvan.    

### Artikel  II  

De lancerende Staat is absoluut aansprakelijk voor de betaling van vergoeding van schade door zijn ruimtevoorwerp toegebracht op het aardoppervlak of aan luchtvaartuigen tijdens de vlucht.  

### Artikel  III  

In geval van schade elders dan op het aardoppervlak aan een ruimtevoorwerp van een lancerende Staat of aan personen of zaken aan boord van een zodanig ruimtevoorwerp toegebracht door een ruimtevoorwerp van een andere lancerende Staat, is laatstgenoemde Staat slechts aansprakelijk indien de schade te wijten is aan zijn schuld of aan de schuld van personen waarvoor hij aansprakelijk is.  

### Artikel  IV  

1.  In geval van schade elders dan op het aardoppervlak aan een ruimtevoorwerp van een lancerende Staat of aan personen of zaken aan boord van een zodanig ruimtevoorwerp toegebracht door een ruimtevoorwerp van een andere lancerende Staat, en in geval van schade daardoor aan een derde Staat of aan zijn natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen toegebracht, zijn de eerstgenoemde twee Staten hoofdelijk aansprakelijk jegens de derde Staat binnen de hierna aangegeven grenzen: 

(a) indien de schade is toegebracht aan de derde Staat op het aardoppervlak of aan een luchtvaartuig in vlucht, zijn zij absoluut aansprakelijk jegens de derde Staat;  

(b) indien de schade is toegebracht aan een ruimtevoorwerp van de derde Staat of aan personen of zaken aan boord van een zodanig ruimtevoorwerp elders dan op het aardoppervlak zijn zij jegens de derde Staat aansprakelijk indien personen voor wie één van beide aansprakelijk is, schuld hebben.     
2.  In alle gevallen van hoofdelijke aansprakelijkheid als bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, wordt de schadevergoeding door de beide eerstgenoemde Staten gedragen naar evenredigheid van hun schuld; indien de mate van de schuld van elk van deze Staten niet kan worden vastgesteld, wordt de schadevergoeding door hen gelijkelijk gedragen. Deze verdeling laat onverlet het recht van de derde Staat om de krachtens deze Overeenkomst verschuldigde schadevergoeding in haar geheel te vorderen van een van de lancerende Staten of van alle lancerende Staten die hoofdelijk aansprakelijk zijn.   

### Artikel  V  

1.  Indien twee of meer Staten gezamenlijk een ruimtevoorwerp lanceren, zijn zij hoofdelijk aansprakelijk voor veroorzaakte schade.   
2.  Een lancerende Staat die schadevergoeding heeft betaald, heeft een recht van verhaal op de andere deelnemers aan de gezamenlijke lancering. De deelnemers aan een gezamenlijke lancering kunnen overeenkomsten sluiten betreffende de onderlinge verdeling van de financiële verplichtingen waarvoor zij hoofdelijk aansprakelijk zijn. Zodanige overeenkomsten laten onverlet het recht van een Staat die schade heeft geleden om de krachtens deze Overeenkomst verschuldigde vergoeding in haar geheel te vorderen van een van de lancerende Staten of van alle lancerende Staten die hoofdelijk aansprakelijk zijn.   
3.  Een Staat vanaf welks grondgebied of installatie een ruimtevoorwerp wordt gelanceerd, wordt beschouwd als deelnemer aan een gezamenlijke lancering.   

### Artikel  VI  

1.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in het tweede lid van dit artikel, wordt een lancerende Staat vrijgesteld van zijn absolute aansprakelijkheid indien en voor zover hij aantoont dat de schade geheel of gedeeltelijk is veroorzaakt door grove schuld of door een handelen of nalaten met de bedoeling schade te veroorzaken van de zijde van de eisende Staat of van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die hij vertegenwoordigt.   
2.  Geen enkele vrijstelling van aansprakelijkheid vindt plaats in gevallen waarin de schade is voortgevloeid uit activiteiten van een lancerende Staat die in strijd zijn met het volkenrecht, waaronder in het bijzonder het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties en het Verdrag inzake de beginselen waaraan de activiteiten van Staten zijn onderworpen bij het onderzoek en gebruik van de kosmische ruimte, met inbegrip van de maan en andere hemellichamen.   

### Artikel  VII  

Het in deze Overeenkomst bepaalde is niet van toepassing op schade door een ruimtevoorwerp van een lancerende Staat toegebracht aan: 

(a) onderdanen van de lancerende Staat;  

(b) onderdanen van andere Staten gedurende de tijd dat zij medewerken aan het functioneren van dat ruimtevoorwerp vanaf het tijdstip van zijn lancering of te eniger tijd daarna tot aan het tijdstip van landing, of gedurende de tijd dat zij zich krachtens een uitnodiging van de lancerende Staat in de onmiddellijke nabijheid bevinden van de lanceerplaats of de plaats van berging.    

### Artikel  VIII  

1.  Een Staat die schade lijdt, of welks natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen schade lijden, kan bij de lancerende Staat een eis tot schadevergoeding indienen.   
2.  Indien de Staat waarvan de natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen de nationaliteit bezitten, geen eis tot schadevergoeding heeft ingediend, kan een andere Staat ter zake van op zijn grondgebied door een natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon geleden schade bij een lancerende Staat een eis tot schadevergoeding indienen.   
3.  Indien noch de Staat waarvan de natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen de nationaliteit bezitten, noch de Staat op welks grondgebied de schade werd geleden, een eis tot schadevergoeding heeft ingediend of heeft kennis gegeven van zijn voornemen zulks te doen, kan een andere Staat ter zake van door zijn ingezetenen geleden schade bij de lancerende Staat een eis tot schadevergoeding indienen.   

### Artikel  IX  

Een eis tot schadevergoeding wordt langs diplomatieke weg bij de lancerende Staat ingediend. Indien een Staat geen diplomatieke betrekkingen onderhoudt met de desbetreffende lancerende Staat, kan hij een andere Staat verzoeken zijn eis tot schadevergoeding bij de lancerende Staat in te dienen of op andere wijze zijn belangen krachtens deze Overeenkomst te behartigen. De Staat kan ook zijn eis tot schadevergoeding indienen door tussenkomst van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, mits de eisende Staat en de lancerende Staat beide Lid zijn van de Verenigde Naties.  

### Artikel  X  

1.  De eis tot schadevergoeding kan bij de lancerende Staat worden ingediend binnen een termijn van een jaar te rekenen van de datum van het ontstaan van de schade of van de identificatie van de aansprakelijke lancerende Staat.   
2.  Indien echter een Staat onkundig is gebleven van het ontstaan van de schade of niet in staat is geweest de aansprakelijke lancerende Staat te identificeren, kan hij nog een eis tot schadevergoeding indienen gedurende een jaar na de datum waarop hij heeft kennis genomen van bedoelde feiten; deze termijn mag echter in geen geval langer zijn dan een jaar te rekenen van de datum waarop de Staat redelijkerwijze met de feiten bekend had kunnen zijn.   
3.  De in het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel aangegeven termijnen zijn eveneens van toepassing indien de omvang van de schade niet nauwkeurig bekend is. In dit geval is echter de eisende Staat gerechtigd na afloop van een zodanige termijn tot uiterlijk één jaar te rekenen van het tijdstip waarop de volle omvang van de schade bekend is, zijn vordering te wijzigen en aanvullende stukken over te leggen.   

### Artikel  XI  

1.  Het is voor de indiening bij een lancerende Staat van een eis tot schadevergoeding krachtens deze Overeenkomst niet vereist dat alle nationale rechtsmiddelen die ter beschikking staan van de eisende Staat of de natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen wier belangen hij vertegenwoordigt, reeds zijn uitgeput.   
2.  Niets in deze Overeenkomst belet een Staat of natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die hij vertegenwoordigt, een eis tot schadevergoeding in te dienen bij de rechterlijke of administratieve instanties van een lancerende Staat. Een Staat is echter niet gerechtigd krachtens deze Overeenkomst een eis tot schadevergoeding in te dienen ter zake van schade indien reeds een eis is ingediend bij de rechterlijke of administratieve instanties van een lancerende Staat en evenmin indien zulks reeds is geschied krachtens een andere internationale overeenkomst die beide Staten bindt.   

### Artikel  XII  

Het bedrag van de schadevergoeding die de lancerende Staat op grond van deze Overeenkomst dient te betalen, wordt bepaald overeenkomstig het volkenrecht en de beginselen van recht en billijkheid, en wel zodanig dat de eisende persoon - hetzij natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon -, de eisende Staat of de eisende internationale organisatie door de schadevergoeding wordt hersteld in de toestand die zou hebben bestaan indien de schade zich niet had voorgedaan.  

### Artikel  XIII  

Tenzij de eisende Staat en de Staat die krachtens deze Overeenkomst schadevergoeding is verschuldigd, overeenstemming bereiken over een andere vorm van schadevergoeding, wordt de schadevergoeding betaald in de munt van de eisende Staat of, indien deze Staat zulks eist, in de munt van de Staat die schadevergoeding is verschuldigd.  

### Artikel  XIV  

Indien niet binnen een jaar te rekenen van de datum waarop de eisende Staat aan de lancerende Staat heeft medegedeeld de bewijsstukken voor zijn eis tot schadevergoeding te hebben overgelegd, een schikking is bereikt via diplomatieke onderhandelingen als voorzien in artikel IX, stellen de betrokken partijen op verzoek van een van beide een Schaderegelingscommissie in.  

### Artikel  XV  

1.  De Schaderegelingscommissie is samengesteld uit drie leden: een lid benoemd door de eisende Staat, een lid benoemd door de lancerende Staat en het derde lid, de Voorzitter, te benoemen door beide partijen gezamenlijk. Elke partij doet zijn benoeming binnen twee maanden na het verzoek tot instelling van de Schaderegelingscommissie.   
2.  Indien niet binnen vier maanden na ontvangst van het verzoek tot instelling van de Commissie overeenstemming is bereikt over de keuze van de Voorzitter, kan elk der partijen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties verzoeken binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden de Voorzitter te benoemen.   

### Artikel  XVI  

1.  Indien een van de partijen haar benoeming niet binnen de aangegeven termijn doet, bestaat de Schaderegelingscommissie, op verzoek van de andere partij, alleen uit de Voorzitter.   
2.  Een vacature die om welke reden dan ook binnen de Commissie is ontstaan, wordt vervuld volgens dezelfde procedure als die welke is gevolgd bij de oorspronkelijke benoeming.   
3.  De Commissie stelt zelf haar werkwijze vast.   
4.  De Commissie bepaalt de plaats of de plaatsen waar zij zitting zal houden en beslist over alle andere administratieve zaken.   
5.  Behalve in geval van beslissingen en uitspraken door een uit een enkel lid bestaande Commissie, komen alle beslissingen en uitspraken van de Commissie tot stand bij meerderheid van stemmen.   

### Artikel  XVII  

Het aantal leden van de Schaderegelingscommissie wordt niet uitgebreid wegens het feit dat twee of meer eisende Staten of twee of meer lancerende Staten betrokken zijn bij een voor de Commissie aanhangig gemaakte procedure. De eisende Staten die aldus gezamenlijk optreden, benoemen te zamen een lid van de Commissie op dezelfde wijze en op dezelfde voorwaarden als in het geval van een enkele eisende Staat. Indien twee of meer lancerende Staten aldus gezamenlijk optreden, benoemen zij te zamen en op dezelfde wijze een lid van de Commissie. Indien de eisende Staten of de lancerende Staten hun benoeming niet doen binnen de aangegeven periode zal de Commissie alleen uit de Voorzitter bestaan.  

### Artikel  XVIII  

De Schaderegelingscommissie beoordeelt of de eis tot schadevergoeding gegrond is en bepaalt, indien daartoe termen aanwezig zijn, het te betalen bedrag.  

### Artikel  XIX

### Artikel  XXI  

Indien de door een ruimtevoorwerp veroorzaakte schade levensgevaar op vrij grote schaal oplevert of ernstig ingrijpt in de levensomstandigheden van de bevolking of het functioneren van vitale centra, onderzoeken de Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst en in het bijzonder de lancerende Staat, de mogelijkheid aan de Staat die de schade heeft geleden, op een daartoe strekkend verzoek zijnerzijds, passende en snelle hulp te bieden. Dit artikel laat echter de rechten of verplichtingen krachtens deze Overeenkomst van Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst onverlet.  

### Artikel  XXII  

1.  Met uitzondering van de verwijzingen die voorkomen in de artikelen XXIV tot en met XXVII, worden alle verwijzingen naar Staten in deze Overeenkomst geacht eveneens van toepassing te zijn op een internationale intergouvernementele organisatie die zich op het gebied van de ruimtevaart beweegt, indien zij verklaart de rechten en verplichtingen waarin deze Overeenkomst voorziet, te aanvaarden, en indien de meerderheid van de Lid-Staten van die organisatie Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst en bij het Verdrag inzake de beginselen waaraan de activiteiten van de Staten zijn onderworpen bij het onderzoek en gebruik van de kosmische ruimte, met inbegrip van de maan en andere hemellichamen.

3.  Indien een internationale intergouvernementele organisatie krachtens het in deze Overeenkomst bepaalde aansprakelijk is voor schade, zijn deze organisatie en haar leden die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst hoofdelijk aansprakelijk, met dien verstande echter dat: 

(a) een eis tot vergoeding van zodanige schade eerst bij de organisatie moet worden ingediend; en  

(b) de eisende Staat de Lid-Staten die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst slechts aansprakelijk kan stellen voor de betaling van het bedrag dat is overeengekomen of vastgesteld als schadevergoeding indien de organisatie dit bedrag niet binnen een termijn van zes maanden heeft betaald.     
4.  Elke eis krachtens het in deze Overeenkomst bepaalde tot vergoeding van schade toegebracht aan een organisatie die een verklaring heeft afgelegd overeenkomstig het eerste lid van dit artikel, dient te worden ingediend door een Lid-Staat van de organisatie die Partij is bij deze Overeenkomst.
