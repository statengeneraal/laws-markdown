####Pro-Rata Pensions

1.  Subject to Articles 18 and 20 to 23, this Article shall apply to determine a person’s entitlement to retirement pension, including any increase for dependants, under the legislation of any part of either Party.

b) the proportion of such theoretical pension which bears the same relation to the whole as the total of the insurance periods completed under the legislation of that part of either Party bears to the total of all the relevant insurance periods completed under the legislation of both Parties.

5.  Where no pension is, or would be, payable under paragraph (4), insurance periods under paragraph (3) shall be treated as if they had been completed under the legislation of the Netherlands.   
6.  Where all the insurance periods completed by a person under the legislation of the Netherlands amount to less than one year those periods shall be treated as if they had been completed under the legislation of the United Kingdom in accordance with paragraph (4).

### Article  20  

####Insurance Periods to be taken into Account

####Overlapping Periods

For the purpose of applying Article 19: 

a) where a compulsory insurance period completed under the legislation of one Party coincides with a voluntary insurance period completed under the legislation of the other Party, only the compulsory insurance period shall be taken into account, provided that the amount of pension payable under the legislation of the latter Party under Article 19(2) shall be increased by the amount by which the pension payable under the legislation of that Party would have been increased if all voluntary contributions paid under that legislation had been taken into account;  

b) where a contribution period completed under the legislation of one Party coincides with an equivalent period completed under the legislation of the other Party, only the contribution period shall be taken into account;

d) where a compulsory contribution period completed under the legislation of one Party coincides with a compulsory contribution period completed under the legislation of the other Party, each Party shall take into account only the compulsory contribution period completed under its own legislation;  

e) where a voluntary contribution period completed under the legislation of one Party coincides with a voluntary contribution period completed under the legislation of the other Party, each Party shall take into account only the voluntary contribution period completed under its own legislation;  

f) where it is not possible to determine accurately the period of time in which certain insurance periods were completed under the legislation of one Party, such insurance periods shall be treated as if they did not overlap with insurance periods completed under the legislation of the other Party and shall be taken into account to the best advantage of the beneficiary.

4.  Recht op een ouderdomspensioen in de in het eerste lid bedoelde omstandigheden belet de bevoegde autoriteit van een onderdeel van een van de Partijen niet in overeenstemming met het derde tot en met zesde lid van artikel 19 verzekeringstijdvakken in aanmerking te nemen die zijn vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van een onderdeel van een van de Partijen.   
5.  Door toepassing van het eerste lid stelt het bevoegde orgaan van Nederland de hoogte van het ouderdomspensioen rechtstreeks en uitsluitend vast op basis van de krachtens de Nederlandse Algemene Ouderdomswet (AOW) vervulde verzekeringstijdvakken. Niettegenstaande dit lid is het vierde lid in voorkomende gevallen van toepassing.   
6.

7.  De in het zesde lid bedoelde tijdvakken worden bij de berekening van het ouderdomspensioen alleen in aanmerking genomen, indien de betrokken persoon verzekerd is geweest in de zin van artikel 6 van de Nederlandse Algemene Ouderdomswet en na het bereiken van de leeftijd van negenenvijftig jaar ten minste zes jaar op het grondgebied van een van beide of beide Partijen heeft gewoond en alleen zolang hij op het grondgebied van een van beide Partijen woont.

### Artikel  19  

####Pro-ratapensioenen

1.  Onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in de artikelen 18 en 20 tot en met 23 is dit artikel van toepassing op de vaststelling van het recht van een persoon op een ouderdomspensioen, met inbegrip van verhogingen voor afhankelijke personen, krachtens de wetgeving van een onderdeel van een van de Partijen.

b. het deel van een dergelijk theoretisch pensioen dat in dezelfde verhouding staat tot het geheel als het totaal van de verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van dat onderdeel van een van de Partijen tot het totaal van alle relevante verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van beide Partijen. Het aldus berekende proportionele bedrag is het pensioen dat feitelijk door de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan betaald moet worden.     
3.  Ten behoeve van de in het tweede lid bedoelde berekening worden, wanneer alle verzekeringstijdvakken die door een persoon worden vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van: 

a. Groot-Brittannië, Noord-Ierland en het Eiland Man minder bedragen dan een jaar dat in aanmerking moet worden genomen, of, naar gelang van het geval, een rechtverstrekkend jaar, of uitsluitend betrekking hebben op tijdvakken vóór 6 april 1975 en tezamen minder dan vijftig weken bedragen; of  

b. Jersey minder dan een jaarbijdragefactor van 1,00 bedragen, of  

c. Guernsey minder dan vijftig weken bedragen,   deze tijdvakken behandeld in overeenstemming met het vierde of vijfde lid.

7.  Een verhoging van een uitkering verschuldigd krachtens de wetgeving van Groot-Brittannië, Noord-Ierland of het Eiland Man vanwege uitgestelde pensionering of een uitgesteld recht, is gebaseerd op het bedrag van het pro-ratapensioen dat in overeenstemming met dit artikel berekend is.

d. neemt, wanneer een tijdvak van verplichte betaling van premie of bijdrage vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij samenvalt met een tijdvak van verplichte betaling van premie of bijdrage vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij, elke Partij uitsluitend het tijdvak van verplichte betaling van premie of bijdrage in aanmerking dat krachtens haar eigen wetgeving vervuld is;  

e. neemt, wanneer een tijdvak van vrijwillige betaling van premie of bijdrage vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij samenvalt met een tijdvak van vrijwillige betaling van premie of bijdrage vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij, elke Partij uitsluitend het tijdvak van vrijwillige betaling van premie of bijdrage in aanmerking dat krachtens haar eigen wetgeving vervuld is;  

f. worden, wanneer het niet mogelijk is nauwkeurig vast te stellen gedurende welke tijd bepaalde verzekeringstijdvakken vervuld zijn krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij, dergelijke verzekeringstijdvakken behandeld als zouden zij niet zijn samengevallen met tijdvakken vervuld krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij en worden zij ten voordele van de uitkeringsgerechtigde in aanmerking genomen.

### Artikel  23  

####Niet-gelijktijdige aanspraak

Wanneer een persoon niet gelijktijdig voldoet aan de voorwaarden voor het recht op een ouderdomspensioen krachtens de wetgeving van beide Partijen, wordt zijn recht dat in elke Partij bestaat vastgesteld zodra hij aan de voorwaarden voldoet die van toepassing zijn krachtens de wetgeving van die Partij, daarbij, wanneer van toepassing, rekening houdend met artikel 19.

2.  Wanneer een persoon het grondgebied van de ene Partij verlaat om voor de uitoefening van zijn werkzaamheden naar het grondgebied van de andere Partij te gaan, maar hem een ongeval overkomt voordat hij op het grondgebied van de laatstgenoemde Partij arriveert, wordt, in verband met enige aanspraak op een uitkering met betrekking tot dat ongeval: 

a. het ongeval behandeld als ware het geschied op het grondgebied van de Partij wier wetgeving ten tijde van het ongeval op hem van toepassing was, en  

b. zijn afwezigheid van het grondgebied van die Partij buiten beschouwing gelaten bij het vaststellen of zijn werkzaamheden werkzaamheden als werknemer krachtens die wetgeving betroffen.

####OVERIGE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  27  

####Terugvordering van voorschotten en te veel betaalde uitkeringen

1.  Wanneer een bevoegde autoriteit of bevoegd orgaan van de ene Partij een uitkering heeft betaald aan een persoon voor enig tijdvak of enige gebeurtenis voorafgaande aan het tijdvak of de gebeurtenis waarop deze uitkering betrekking heeft of aan hem een uitkering heeft betaald voor een tijdvak of gebeurtenis, hetzij uit hoofde van dit Verdrag hetzij anderszins, en de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij naderhand besluit dat de persoon recht heeft op een uitkering voor dat tijdvak of die gebeurtenis krachtens haar wetgeving, brengt de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de laatstgenoemde Partij, op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij, op de voor dat tijdvak of die gebeurtenis verschuldigde uitkering, krachtens haar wetgeving in mindering hetgeen te veel is betaald indien dit, uit hoofde van dit Verdrag, het gevolg is van de betaling van een voorschot op de uitkering, of van de betaalde uitkering, door de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij, en maakt dit bedrag, wanneer van toepassing, over aan de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij.   
2.  Wanneer de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de ene Partij een uitkeringsgerechtigde een bedrag heeft betaald dat hoger is dan het bedrag waarop hij recht heeft, kan die autoriteit of dat orgaan, onder de voorwaarden en binnen de grenzen neergelegd in de wetgeving die zij of het uitvoert, de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij die of dat verantwoordelijk is voor de betaling van uitkeringen aan die belanghebbende verzoeken het te veel betaalde bedrag in mindering te brengen op de bedragen die het aan genoemde belanghebbende betaalt. De laatstgenoemde bevoegde autoriteit of het laatstgenoemde bevoegde orgaan past de mindering toe onder de voorwaarden en binnen de grenzen die voor een dergelijke compensatie in de wetgeving die zij of het uitvoert zijn voorzien, alsof de te hoge bedragen door deze autoriteit of dit orgaan zelf waren betaald, en maakt het in mindering gebrachte bedrag over aan de autoriteit of het orgaan dat de vordering heeft.   
3.  Wanneer een persoon sociale bijstand heeft ontvangen krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij gedurende een tijdvak waarvoor deze persoon naderhand recht heeft op een uitkering krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij, houdt de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de laatstgenoemde Partij, op verzoek van en namens de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij, de voor dat tijdvak te betalen uitkering in en maakt het ingehouden bedrag over aan de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij. De bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij brengt op de uitkering verschuldigd krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij het bedrag aan sociale bijstand in mindering waarmee het bedrag dat zou zijn betaald indien de uitkering krachtens de wetgeving van de laatstgenoemde Partij zou zijn betaald voordat het bedrag aan sociale bijstand werd vastgesteld, wordt overschreden. Uitkeringen die niet op deze wijze in mindering worden gebracht, worden aan de persoon overgemaakt.   

### Artikel  28  

####Regelingen inzake administratie en samenwerking

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de twee Partijen sluiten een administratief akkoord dat noodzakelijk is voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag.   
2.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de twee Partijen verstrekken elkaar zo spoedig mogelijk alle inlichtingen omtrent de door hen getroffen maatregelen voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag of omtrent wijzigingen in hun nationale wetgeving voor zover deze wijzigingen van invloed zijn op de toepassing van dit Verdrag.   
3.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de twee Partijen stellen verbindingskantoren in om de uitvoering van dit Verdrag te vergemakkelijken.   
4.  De bevoegde autoriteiten of de bevoegde organen van de twee Partijen zijn elkaar behulpzaam bij elke aangelegenheid die betrekking heeft op de toepassing van dit Verdrag als ware de aangelegenheid van invloed op de toepassing van hun eigen wetgeving. Dergelijke bijstand is kosteloos.   
5.  Wanneer een uitkering verschuldigd is krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij aan een persoon op het grondgebied van de andere Partij, kunnen door de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de laatstgenoemde Partij, op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij, regelingen voor de betaling worden getroffen; de laatstgenoemde Partij wordt door de eerstgenoemde Partij terugbetaald.   
6.  Wanneer een persoon die zich op het grondgebied van de ene Partij bevindt een uitkering aanvraagt of ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij en een geneeskundig onderzoek noodzakelijk is, treft de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij, op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de laatstgenoemde Partij, maatregelen voor een dergelijk onderzoek. De kosten van een dergelijk onderzoek komen voor rekening van de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij. De bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan blijft evenwel bevoegd de desbetreffende persoon op te roepen voor een geneeskundig onderzoek. In het geval dat het Nederlandse bevoegde orgaan het noodzakelijk acht dat bepaalde medische onderzoeken die uitsluitend in zijn belang zijn, op het grondgebied van de andere Partij worden uitgevoerd, wordt de procedure toegepast die in de Nederlandse wetgeving voorzien is.   
7.  Een door het bevoegde orgaan van Nederland benoemd medisch college wordt, op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit van Guernsey, beschouwd als een medisch college voor beslissingen inzake invaliditeitskwesties krachtens de wetgeving van Guernsey.   
8.  Indien de wetgeving van de ene Partij bepaalt dat een verklaring die of ander document dat wordt ingediend ingevolge de wetgeving van die Partij geheel of gedeeltelijk wordt vrijgesteld van belastingen, leges, consulaire heffingen of administratieve heffingen, is deze vrijstelling van toepassing op elke verklaring die of ander document dat wordt ingediend ingevolge de wetgeving van de andere Partij of in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag.   
9.  Verklaringen, documenten en certificaten van welke aard dan ook die voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag dienen te worden overgelegd, worden vrijgesteld van legalisatie door diplomatieke of consulaire autoriteiten.   
10.  Certificaten, documenten of verklaringen van welke aard dan ook die in een officiële taal van een van de Partijen zijn gesteld mogen niet worden afgewezen op grond van het feit dat zij in een vreemde taal zijn gesteld.   
11.  Tenzij bekendmaking vereist is ingevolge de wetgeving van de ene Partij, zijn inlichtingen over een persoon die aan die Partij worden gezonden door de andere Partij in overeenstemming met en voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag vertrouwelijk en worden zij uitsluitend gebruikt ten behoeve van de uitvoering van dit Verdrag en de wetgeving waarop dit Verdrag van toepassing is.   

### Artikel  29  

####Indiening van een aanvraag of beroepschrift

1.  Aanvragen of beroepschriften die, voor de toepassing van de wetgeving van de ene Partij, binnen een voorgeschreven tijdvak ingediend zouden moeten zijn bij de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van die Partij, worden, indien zij in ditzelfde tijdvak zijn ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij, beschouwd als waren zij ingediend bij de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij.   
2.  Elke aanvraag om een uitkering die ingediend is krachtens de wetgeving van de ene Partij wordt tevens geacht een aanvraag voor een overeenkomstige uitkering krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij te zijn voor zover deze overeenkomstige uitkering verschuldigd is in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag.   

### Artikel  30  

####Valuta en betalingswijze

1.  Betaling van een uitkering in overeenstemming met dit Verdrag kan geschieden in de valuta van de Partij wier bevoegde autoriteit of bevoegd orgaan de betaling doet en een dergelijke betaling houdt een volledige nakoming in van de verplichting ter zake waarvan de betaling is geschied.   
2.  Wanneer de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de ene Partij namens de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de andere Partij een betaling heeft verricht in overeenstemming met artikel 28, vijfde lid, vindt enige terugbetaling van de door de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de eerstgenoemde Partij betaalde bedragen plaats in de valuta van de laatstgenoemde Partij.   
3.  Wanneer een persoon die zich op het grondgebied van de ene Partij bevindt een uitkering ontvangt krachtens de wetgeving van de andere Partij, vindt de betaling plaats volgens een methode die de bevoegde autoriteit of het bevoegde orgaan van de laatstgenoemde Partij passend acht.   

### Artikel  31  

####Beslechting van geschillen

1.  De bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partijen bij dit Verdrag doen alle redelijke pogingen om geschillen die voortvloeien uit de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag in onderlinge overeenstemming op te lossen.   
2.  Indien een geschil niet op de in het eerste lid bedoelde wijze kan worden beslecht, wordt het op verzoek van de bevoegde autoriteit van een van de Partijen, voorgelegd aan een scheidsgerecht dat op de volgende wijze wordt samengesteld: 

a. elke Partij benoemt een scheidsman binnen een maand na ontvangst van het verzoek om arbitrage. De twee scheidslieden benoemen een derde scheidsman, die geen onderdaan is van een van beide Partijen, binnen twee maanden na de datum waarop de Partij die als laatste een scheidsman heeft benoemd de andere Partij van de benoeming in kennis heeft gesteld;  

b. indien een van de Partijen nalaat binnen de voorgeschreven termijn een scheidsman te benoemen, kan de andere Partij de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof, of indien deze onderdaan van een van de Partijen is, de Vice-President of het lid van het Hof met de hoogste anciënniteit dat geen onderdaan van een van de Partijen is, verzoeken de benoeming te verrichten. Op verzoek van een van de Partijen wordt een soortgelijke procedure gehanteerd indien de twee scheidslieden geen overeenstemming bereiken over de benoeming van de derde scheidsman.     
3.  Het scheidsgerecht neemt zijn beslissing bij meerderheid van stemmen. Deze beslissing is onherroepelijk en bindend voor beide Partijen. Het scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedureregels vast en de kosten worden door beide Partijen in gelijke delen gedragen.
