Op dezelfde wijze wordt te werk gegaan indien de beide scheidsmannen binnen drie maanden na de aanwijzing van de beide eerste scheidsmannen geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de keuze van de derde scheidsman.   
3.  In geval van een geschil tussen twee Verdragsluitende Partijen waarvan de een Lid-Staat is van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, die zelf Verdragsluitende Partij is, richt de andere Verdragsluitende Partij het verzoek om arbitrage zowel aan deze Lid-Staat als aan de Gemeenschap, die beide bedoelde Partij, binnen twee maanden na ontvangst van het verzoek, ervan in kennis stellen of de Lid-Staat dan wel de Gemeenschap of de Lid-Staat te zamen met de Gemeenschap als partij zullen optreden bij het geschil. Wanneer deze kennisgeving niet binnen genoemde termijn wordt gedaan, worden de Lid-Staat en de Gemeenschap geacht op te treden als een en dezelfde partij bij het geschil voor de toepassing van de bepalingen betreffende de vorming en de werkwijze van het scheidsgerecht. Dit is ook het geval wanneer de Lid-Staat en de Gemeenschap gezamenlijk optreden als partij bij het geschil.   
4.  Het scheidsgerecht stelt zijn eigen procedureregels vast. De beslissingen worden genomen met meerderheid van stemmen. Zijn uitspraak is definitief en bindend.   
5.  Iedere partij bij het geschil draagt de kosten van de scheidsman die zij heeft aangewezen en de partijen dragen gelijkelijk de kosten van de derde scheidsman alsmede de andere aan de arbitrage verbonden kosten.
