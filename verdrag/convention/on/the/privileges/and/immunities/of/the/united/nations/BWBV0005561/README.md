####CONVENTION ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 13 February 1946.  

*Whereas* Article 104 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that the Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such legal capacity as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions and the fulfilment of its purpose and *Whereas* Article 105 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that the Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes and that representatives of the Members of the United Nations and officials of the Organization shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization.   *Consequently* the General Assembly by a Resolution adopted on the 13 February 1946, approved the following Convention and proposed it for accession by each Member of the United Nations.

####Property, funds and assets.

*Section 2.* The United Nations, its property and assets wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity. It is, however, understood that no waiver of immunity shall extend to any measure of execution. *Section 3.* The premises of the United Nations shall be inviolable. The property and assets of the United Nations, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action. *Section 4.* The archives of the United Nations, and in general all documents belonging to it or held by it, shall be inviolable wherever located. *Section 5.* Without being restricted by financial controls, regulations or moratoria of any kind,

(*a*) exempt from all direct taxes; It is understood, however, that the United Nations will not claim exemption from taxes which are, in fact, no more than charges for public utility services;  

(*b*) exempt from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect of articles imported or exported by the United Nations for its official use. It is understood, however, that articles imported under such exemption will not be sold in the country into which they were imported except under conditions agreed with the Government of that country;  

(*c*) exempt from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect of its publications.   *Section 8.* While the United Nations will not, as a general rule, claim exemption from excise duties and from taxes on the sale of movable and immovable property which form part of the price to be paid, nevertheless when the United Nations is making important purchases for official use of property on which such duties and taxes have been charged or are chargeable, Members will, whenever possible, make appropriate administrative arrangements for the remission or return of the amount of duty or tax.  

### Article  III  

####Facilities in respect of communications

*Section 9.* The United Nations shall enjoy in the territory of each Member for its official communications treatment not less favourable than that accorded by the Government of that Member to any other Government including its diplomatic mission in the matter of priorities, rates and taxes on mails, cables, telegrams, radiograms, telephotos, telephone and other communications; and press rates for information to the press and radio. No censorship shall be applied to the official correspondence and other official communications of the United Nations. *Section 10.* The United Nations shall have the right to use codes and to despatch and receive its correspondence by courier or in bags, which shall have the same immunities and privileges as diplomatic couriers and bags.  

### Article  IV  

####The representatives of Members.

*Section 11.* Representatives of Members to the principal and subsidiary organs of the United Nations and to conferences convened by the United Nations, shall, while exercising their functions and during their journey to and from the place of meeting, enjoy the following privileges and immunities: 

(*a*) immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage, and, in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in their capacity as representatives, immunity from legal process of every kind;  

(*b*) inviolability for all papers and documents;  

(*c*) the right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags;  

(*d*) exemption in respect of themselves and their spouses from immigration restrictions, aliens registration or national service obligations in the state they are visiting or through which they are passing in the exercise of their functions;

(*g*) such other privileges, immunities and facilities not inconsistent with the foregoing as diplomatic envoys enjoy, except that they shall have no right to claim exemption from customs duties on goods imported (otherwise than as part of their personal baggage) or from excise duties or sales taxes.   *Section 12.* In order to secure, for the representatives of Members to the principal and subsidiary organs of the United Nations and to conferences convened by the United Nations, complete freedom of speech and independence in the discharge of their duties, the immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in discharging their duties shall continue to be accorded, notwithstanding that the persons concerned are no longer the representatives of Members. *Section 13.* Where the incidence of any form of taxation depends upon residence, periods during which the representatives of Members to the principal and subsidiary organs of the United Nations and to conferences convened by the United Nations are present in a state for the discharge of their duties shall not be considered as periods of residence. *Section 14.* Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of Members not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the United Nations.

The Secretary-General shall have the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any official in any case where, in his opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United Nations. In the case of the Secretary-General, the Security Council shall have the right to waive immunity. *Section 21.* The United Nations shall co-operate at all times with the appropriate authorities of Members to facilitate the proper administration of justice, secure the observance of police regulations and prevent the occurrence of any abuse in connection with the privileges, immunities and facilities mentioned in this Article

In particular they shall be accorded: 

(*a*) immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage;

(*d*) for the purpose of their communications with the United Nations, the right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags;  

(*e*) the same facilities in respect of currency or exchange restrictions as are accorded to representatives of foreign governments on temporary official missions;

The Secretary-General shall have the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any expert in any case where, in his opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United Nations.  

### Article  VII  

####United Nations laissez-passer.

### Article  VIII  

####Settlement of disputes.

*Section 29.* The United Nations shall make provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of: 

(*a*) disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private law character to which the United Nations is a party;

####VERDRAG NOPENS DE VOORRECHTEN EN IMMUNITEITEN VAN DE VERENIGDE NATIES

Aangezien art. 104 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties bepaalt, dat de Organisatie op het gebied van ieder van haar Leden zodanige rechtsbevoegdheid zal bezitten, als nodig zal zijn voor de uitoefening van haar functies en het verwezenlijken van haar doeleinden, en Aangezien art. 105 van het Handvest van de Verenigde Naties bepaalt, dat de Organisatie op het gebied van ieder van haar Leden zodanige voorrechten en immuniteiten zal genieten, als nodig zullen zijn voor het verwezenlijken van haar doeleinden en dat vertegenwoordigers van de Leden van de Verenigde Naties en functionarissen van de Organisatie eveneens zodanige voorrechten en immuniteiten zullen genieten, als nodig zullen zijn voor de onafhankelijke uitoefening van hun functies in verband met de Organisatie,   Heeft derhalve de Algemene Vergadering in een resolutie, aangenomen op 13 Februari 1946, het volgende Verdrag goedgekeurd en stelt zij voor, dat ieder Lid van de Verenigde Naties hiertoe zal toetreden.    

### Artikel  I  

####Rechtspersoonlijkheid.

§ 1. De Verenigde Naties zullen rechtspersoonlijkheid bezitten. Zij zullen de bevoegdheid hebben: 

(*a*) Overeenkomsten aan te gaan;  

(*b*) Onroerend en roerend goed te verwerven en hierover te beschikken;  

(*c*) In rechte te verschijnen.    

### Artikel  II  

####Eigendommen, fondsen en bezittingen.

§ 2. De Verenigde Naties, haar eigendommen en bezittingen, waar deze ook gelegen zijn, en wie deze ook onder zich heeft, zullen vrijgesteld zijn van rechtsvervolging, behoudens wanneer de Verenigde Naties in een bijzonder geval uitdrukkelijk afstand zullen hebben gedaan van haar immuniteit. Het is echter wel verstaan, dat afstand van immuniteit zich niet uitstrekt tot enige maatregel van tenuitvoerlegging. § 3. De gebouwen en de terreinen van de Verenigde Naties zullen onschendbaar zijn. De eigendommen en bezittingen van de Verenigde Naties, waar deze ook gelegen zijn en wie deze ook onder zich heeft, zullen vrijgesteld zijn van onderzoek, vordering, confiscatie, onteigening of van iedere andere vorm van ingrijpen, hetzij door optreden van uitvoerende, administratieve, rechterlijke of wetgevende aard. § 4. Het archief van de Verenigde Naties en in het algemeen alle stukken, die aan haar behoren of die zij onder zich hebben, zullen onschendbaar zijn, waar deze zich ook bevinden. § 5. Zonder beperkt te worden door financiële voorschriften, regelen of moratoria van enigerlei aard, 

(*a*) kunnen de Verenigde Naties fondsen, goud of valuta's van enigerlei aard bezitten en rekeningen hebben in iedere geldsoort;  

(*b*) zullen de Verenigde Naties vrij zijn haar fondsen, goud of valuta van het ene land naar het andere land of binnen een land te vervoeren en een valuta, die zij bezitten, om te zetten in enige andere valuta.   § 6. Bij de uitoefening van de rechten, die haar zijn verleend krachtens § 5 hierboven, zullen de Verenigde Naties de nodige aandacht schenken aan vertogen van de Regering van een Lid, voor zover geoordeeld wordt, dat aan zodanig vertoog gevolg kan worden gegeven zonder de belangen van de Verenigde Naties te schaden. § 7. De Verenigde Naties, haar bezittingen, inkomen en verdere eigendommen zullen: 

(*a*) vrijgesteld zijn van alle directe belastingen; het is echter wel te verstaan, dat de Verenigde Naties geen vrijstelling zullen opeisen van belastingen, die in feite niet anders zijn dan retributies voor algemene overheidsdiensten;  

(*b*) vrijgesteld zijn van douanerechten, alsmede van verboden en beperkingen van invoer en uitvoer met betrekking tot artikelen, die door de Verenigde Naties worden ingevoerd of uitgevoerd voor haar officieel gebruik. Het is echter wel verstaan, dat de artikelen, die met zodanige vrijstelling zijn ingevoerd, in het land, waarin zij werden ingevoerd, niet zullen worden verkocht anders dan op voorwaarden, waaromtrent met de Regering van dat land overeenstemming zal zijn bereikt;  

(*c*) vrijgesteld zijn van douanerechten, alsmede van verboden en beperkingen van invoer en uitvoer met betrekking tot haar publicaties.   § 8. Terwijl de Verenigde Naties in principe geen vrijstelling zullen opeisen van accijnzen en van belastingen op de verkoop van roerend en onroerend goed, welke een deel vormen van de te betalen prijs, zullen desniettemin, wanneer de Verenigde Naties voor officieel gebruik belangrijke inkopen doen van goederen, waarop zodanige rechten en belastingen gelegd zijn of gelegd kunnen worden, de Leden, telkens wanneer dit mogelijk is, de nodige administratieve regelingen treffen voor de kwijtschelding of teruggave van het bedrag van zodanige rechten of belastingen.  

### Artikel  III  

####Faciliteiten met betrekking tot communicatiemiddelen.

§ 9. De Verenigde Naties zullen op het grondgebied van ieder Lid voor haar officiële mededelingen een behandeling genieten, die niet minder gunstig zal zijn dan die, welke door de Regering van dat Lid wordt toegestaan aan enige andere Regering met inbegrip van haar diplomatieke missie, wat betreft prioriteiten, tarieven en belastingen op post, kabeltelegrammen, telegrammen, radiogrammen, telefoto's, telefoon en andere communicatiemiddelen, alsmede perstarieven voor mededelingen aan pers of radio. Op de officiële correspondentie en andere officiële mededelingen van de Verenigde Naties zal geen censuur worden toegepast. § 10. De Verenigde Naties zullen het recht hebben codes te gebruiken en haar correspondentie te verzenden en te ontvangen per koerier of in zakken, welke dezelfde immuniteiten en voorrechten zullen hebben als diplomatieke koeriers en zakken.  

### Artikel  IV  

####Vertegenwoordigers van Leden.

§ 11. De vertegenwoordigers van Leden in de voornaamste en hulporganen van de Verenigde Naties en op conferenties, die door de Verenigde Naties zijn bijeengeroepen, zullen gedurende de uitoefening van hun functies en gedurende hun reis naar en van de plaats van samenkomst de volgende voorrechten en immuniteiten genieten: 

(*a*) immuniteit van persoonlijke arrestatie of gevangenhouding en van inbeslagneming van hun persoonlijke bagage, alsmede met betrekking tot in hun hoedanigheid van vertegenwoordigers door hen gesproken of geschreven woorden en alle door hen verrichte handelingen, vrijstelling van rechtsvervolging;  

(*b*) onschendbaarheid voor alle papieren en stukken;  

(*c*) het recht codes te gebruiken en papieren of correspondentie te ontvangen per koerier of in verzegelde zakken;  

(*d*) vrijstelling met betrekking tot hen zelf en hun echtgenoten van immigratiebeperkingen, vreemdelingenregistratie of nationale dienstplicht in de landen, die zij bezoeken of waar zij doorreizen in de uitoefening van hun functies;  

(*e*) dezelfde faciliteiten met betrekking tot beperkingen nopens geld of het wisselen van geld als worden toegestaan aan vertegenwoordigers van vreemde Regeringen, die met een tijdelijke officiële zending zijn belast;  

(*f*) dezelfde immuniteiten en faciliteiten met betrekking tot hun persoonlijke bagage als worden toegestaan aan hen, die met een diplomatieke zending zijn belast; en voorts,  

(*g*) zodanige andere voorechten, immuniteiten en faciliteiten, die niet onverenigbaar zijn met het voorafgaande, als zij, die met een diplomatieke zending zijn belast, genieten, behoudens, dat zij niet het recht zullen hebben vrijstelling te eisen van douanerechten op ingevoerde goederen (andere dan dezulke, die deel uitmaken van hun persoonlijke bagage) of wel van accijnzen of belastingen op verkoop.   § 12. Ten einde de vertegenwoordigers van Leden in de voornaamste en hulporganen van de Verenigde Naties en op conferenties, die door de Verenigde Naties zijn bijeengeroepen, volledige vrijheid van het woord en onafhankelijkheid bij de uitoefening van hun taak te verzekeren, zal de immuniteit van rechtsvervolging met betrekking tot door hen gesproken of geschreven woorden en alle door hen in de uitoefening van hun taak verrichte handelingen toegekend blijven ook wanneer de betrokken personen niet langer de vertegenwoordigers van Leden zijn. § 13. In die gevallen, waarin de verschuldigdheid tot enige vorm van belasting afhangt van verblijf, zullen de perioden, gedurende welke de vertegenwoordigers van Leden in de voornaamste en hulporganen van de Verenigde Naties en op conferenties, die door de Verenigde Naties zijn bijeengeroepen, in een Staat aanwezig zijn voor de uitoefening van hun taak, niet geacht worden perioden van verblijf te zijn. § 14. Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan de vertegenwoordigers van Leden niet toegekend voor het persoonlijke voordeel van deze individuele vertegenwoordigers, doch ten einde de onafhankelijke uitoefening van hun functies in verband met de Verenigde Naties te verzekeren. Derhalve heeft een Lid niet alleen het recht, maar is het verplicht afstand te doen van de immuniteit van zijn vertegenwoordiger telkens wanneer naar het oordeel van dit Lid de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en van de immuniteit afstand kan worden gedaan zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op het doel, waarvoor de immuniteit wordt toegekend. § 15. De bepalingen van § 11, 12 en 13 zijn niet van toepassing tussen een vertegenwoordiger en de autoriteiten van de Staat, waarvan hij een onderdaan is of waarvan hij de vertegenwoordiger is of is geweest. § 16. In dit artikel wordt de uitdrukking „vertegenwoordigers” geacht te omvatten alle gedelegeerden, plaatsvervangende gedelegeerden, adviseurs, technische deskundigen en secretarissen van delegaties.  

### Artikel  V  

####Functionarissen.

§ 17. De Secretaris-Generaal zal aangeven, op welke categoriën van functionarissen de bepalingen van dit artikel en art. VII van toepassing zullen zijn. Hij zal deze categoriën voorleggen aan de Algemene Vergadering. Daarna zullen deze categoriën aan de Regeringen van alle Leden worden medegedeeld. De namen van de functionarissen, die in deze categoriën begrepen zijn, zullen van tijd tot tijd ter kennis van de Regeringen van de Leden worden gebracht. § 18.

Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan functionarissen verleend in het belang van de Verenigde Naties en niet voor het persoonlijke voordeel van deze individuële functionarissen. De Secretaris-Generaal zal het recht en de plicht hebben afstand te doen van de immuniteit van een functionaris, telkens wanneer naar zijn oordeel de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en van de immuniteit afstand kan worden gedaan zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de belangen van de Verenigde Naties. Ingeval het de Secretaris-Generaal betreft, zal de Veiligheidsraad het recht hebben afstand te doen van de immuniteit. § 21. De verenigde Naties zullen te allen tijde met de daarvoor aangewezen autoriteiten van de Leden samenwerken om de juiste rechtsbedeling te bevorderen, het nakomen van politievoorschriften te verzekeren en te voorkomen dat misbruik optreedt in verband met de voorrechten, immuniteiten en faciliteiten, bedoeld in dit artikel.  

### Artikel  VI  

####Deskundigen met zendingen voor de Verenigde Naties.

§ 22. Aan deskundigen (andere dan de functionarissen, die binnen het kader van art. V vallen), die zendingen voor de Verenigde Naties verrichten, zullen zodanige voorechten en immuniteiten worden verleend als noodzakelijk zal zijn voor de onafhankelijke uitoefening van hun functies gedurende de periode van hun zendingen, met inbegrip van de tijd gebruikt voor reizen in verband met hun zendingen. In het bijzonder zullen hun worden verleend:

(*f*) dezelfde immuniteiten en faciliteiten met betrekking tot hun persoonlijke bagage als worden toegestaan aan hen, die met een diplomatieke zending zijn belast.   § 23. Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan de deskundigen verleend in het belang van de Verenigde Naties en niet voor het persoonlijke voordeel van de individuele deskundigen. De Secretaris-Generaal zal het recht en de plicht hebben afstand te doen van de immuniteit van een deskundige, telkens wanneer naar zijn oordeel de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en van de immuniteit afstand kan worden gedaan zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de belangen van de Verenigde Naties.

De bepalingen van dit artikel kunnen worden toegepast op vergelijkbare functionarissen van gespecialiseerde organisaties, indien de overeenkomsten, waarbij deze organisaties krachtens art. 63 van het Handvest met de Verenigde Naties in verband worden gebracht dit voorzien.
