d. vrijstelling met betrekking tot hen zelf en hun echtgenoten van immigratiebeperkingen, vreemdelingenregistratie of nationale dienstplicht in de landen, die zij bezoeken of waar zij doorreizen in de uitoefening van hun functies;  

e. dezelfde faciliteiten met betrekking tot beperkingen of het wisselen van geld als worden toegestaan aan vertegenwoordigers van vreemde Regeringen, die met een tijdelijk-officiële zending zijn belast;  

f. dezelfde immuniteiten en faciliteiten met betrekking tot hun persoonlijke bagage als worden toegestaan aan leden van diplomatieke zendingen, die een vergelijkbare rang hebben.   § 14. Teneinde de vertegenwoordigers van leden van de gespecialiseerde organisaties op conferenties, die door haar zijn bijeengeroepen, volledige vrijheid van het woord en onafhankelijkheid bij de uitoefening van hun taak te verzekeren, blijft de immuniteit van rechtsvervolging met betrekking tot door hen gesproken of geschreven woorden en alle door hen in de uitoefening van hun taak verrichte handelingen toegekend, ook wanneer het mandaat van de betrokken personen beëindigd is. § 15. In die gevallen, waarin de verschuldigdheid tot enige vorm van belasting afhangt van verblijf, worden de perioden, gedurende welke de vertegenwoordigers van de leden van de gespecialiseerde organisaties op vergaderingen, die door haar zijn bijeengeroepen, in een Staat aanwezig zijn voor de uitoefening van hun taak, niet geacht perioden van verblijf te zijn. § 16. Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan de vertegenwoordigers van leden niet toegekend voor het persoonlijke voordeel van deze individuele vertegenwoordigers, doch teneinde de onafhankelijke uitoefening van hun functies in verband met de gespecialiseerde organisaties te verzekeren. Derhalve heeft een lid niet alleen het recht, maar is het verplicht de immuniteit van zijn vertegenwoordiger op te heffen, telkens wanneer naar het oordeel van dit lid de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en van de immuniteit afstand kan worden gedaan, zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op het doel, waarvoor de immuniteit wordt toegekend. § 17. De bepalingen van § 13, 14 en 15 zijn niet van toepassing op de autoriteiten van de Staat, waarvan de persoon een onderdaan is of waarvan hij een vertegenwoordiger is of is geweest.  

### Artikel  VI  

####Functionarissen

§ 18. Elke gespecialiseerde organisatie geeft aan, op welke categorieën van functionarissen de bepalingen van dit artikel en artikel VIII van toepassing zijn. Zij doet met betrekking tot die organisatie daarvan mededeling aan de Regering van elke Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, alsmede aan de Secretaris-Generaal der Verenigde Naties. De namen van de functionarissen, die in deze categorieën begrepen zijn, worden van tijd tot tijd ter kennis van voornoemde Regeringen gebracht. § 19. De functionarissen der gespecialiseerde organisaties: 

a. zijn vrijgesteld van rechtsvervolging met betrekking tot woorden door hen gesproken of geschreven, en alle handelingen door hen verricht in hun officiële hoedanigheid;  

b. genieten dezelfde vrijstelling van belasting op de salarissen en emolumenten, welke door de gespecialiseerde organisatie en op dezelfde voorwaarden worden uitbetaald als door de functionarissen van de Verenigde Naties genoten worden;  

c. zijn tezamen met hun echtgenoten en van hen afhankelijke verwanten vrijgesteld van immigratiebeperkingen en vreemdelingenregistratie;  

d. ontvangen dezelfde voorrechten met betrekking tot faciliteiten nopens het wisselen van geld als verleend worden aan ambtenaren van vergelijkbare rang, van diplomatieke zendingen;  

e. ontvangen, tezamen met hun echtgenoten en van hen afhankelijke verwanten dezelfde repatriëringsfaciliteiten, in tijden van internationale crisis, als ambtenaren van vergelijkbare rang van diplomatieke zendingen;  

f. hebben het recht hun huisraad en goederen vrij van rechten in te voeren de eerste maal, dat zij hun post in het betreffende land aanvaarden.   § 20. De functionarissen van de gespecialiseerde organisaties zijn vrijgesteld van nationale dienstplicht, behoudens dat, met betrekking tot de Staten, welke natonaliteit zij hebben, die vrijstelling beperkt is tot functionarissen van de gespecialiseerde organisaties, wier namen, uit hoofde van hun fucties, op een lijst geplaatst zijn, welke door het uitvoerende hoofd van de gespecialiseerde organisatie is opgesteld en door de betrokken Staat is goedgekeurd. In het geval, dat andere functionarissen van gespecialiseerde organisaties voor nationale dienstplicht worden opgeroepen, verleent de betrokken Staat, op verzoek van de gespecialiseerde organisatie, aan dergelijke functionarissen zodanig uitstel als vereist wordt om onderbreking van volstrekt noodzakelijk werk te vermijden. § 21. Behalve de immuniteiten en voorrechten, die aangegeven zijn in § 19 en 20, wordt aan het uitvoerend hoofd, van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, de functionaris, die tijdens afwezigheid namens het uitvoerend hoofd optreedt, met betrekking tot hem zelf, zijn echtgenote en minderjarige kinderen, de voorrechten en immuniteiten, vrijstellingen en faciliteiten toegestaan, welke overeenkomstig het internationale recht worden toegestaan aan hen, die met een diplomatieke zending belast zijn. § 22. Voorrechten en immuniteiten worden aan de functionarissen slechts verleend in het belang van de gespecialiseerde organisaties en niet voor het persoonlijke van deze individuele functionarissen. Iedere gespecialiseerde organisatie heeft het recht en de plicht afstand te doen van de immuniteit van een functionaris, telkens wanneer naar haar oordeel de immuniteit aan de loop van de gerechtigheid in de weg zou staan en afstand van de immuniteit kan worden gedaan, zonder dat inbreuk wordt gemaakt op de belangen van de gespecialiseerde organisaties. § 23. Iedere gespecialiseerde organisatie dient te allen tijde met de daarvoor aangewezen autoriteiten van de Statenleden samen te werken om de juiste rechtbedeling te bevorderen, het nakomen van politievoorschriften te verzekeren en te voorkomen, dat misbruik optreedt in verband met de voorrechten, immuniteiten en faciliteiten, bedoeld in dit artikel.  

### Artikel  VII  

####Misbruik van voorrechten

§ 24. Wanneer een Staat, Partij van dit Verdrag, van mening is, dat zich een misbruik heeft voorgedaan van een bij dit Verdrag verleend voorrecht of verleende immuniteit, wordt tussen die Staat en de betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie overleg gepleegd teneinde vast te stellen, of zulk een misbruik heeft plaats gehad en indien dit het geval blijkt te zijn, teneinde te trachten een herhaling er van te voorkomen. Indien, tengevolge van dit overleg, niet een resultaat wordt bereikt, dat die Staat en de gespecialiseerde organisatie bevredigt, wordt de vraag, of er misbruik van een voorrecht of immuniteit heeft plaats gehad, overeenkomstig § 32 voorgelegd aan het Internationale Gerechtshof. Indien het Internationale Gerechtshof beslist, dat een dergelijk misbruik heeft plaats gehad, heeft de Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, die dit misbruik heeft ondervonden, het recht, na kennisgeving aan de gespecialiseerde organisatie, de voordelen van het voorrecht of de immuniteit, waarvan misbruik is gemaakt, aan de betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie te onthouden. § 25. 

1. De vertegenwoordigers der leden op de door de gespecialiseerde organisaties bijeengeroepen vergaderingen, tijdens de uitoefening van hun functies en hun reizen naar en van de plaats der vergadering, evenals de in § 18 bedoelde functionarissen, kunnen niet door de plaatselijke autoriteiten verplicht worden het land, waarin zij hun functies uitoefenen, te verlaten uit hoofde van de door hen in hun officiële hoedanigheid verrichte werkzaamheden. In het geval echter van misbruik van verblijf, door een persoon, die zich in dat land bezig houdt met zaken, die buiten zijn officiële functies, vallen, kan deze door de Regering van dat land verplicht worden het land te verlaten, onder voorbehoud dat:  

2. 

I. Vertegenwoordigers van leden, of personen, die krachtens § 21 diplomatieke immuniteit genieten, niet verplicht kunnen worden het land te verlaten, tenzij zulks geschiedt overeenkomstig de diplomatieke handelwijze, welke van toepassing is op de diplomatieke vertegenwoordigers, die in dat land geaccrediteerd zijn.  

II. In geval van een funtionaris, op wien § 21 niet van toepassing is, geen besluit tot uitwijzing uit het land wordt uitgevaardigd, tenzij met goedkeuring van de Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken van het betrokken land, en een dergelijke goedkeuring wordt slechts verleend, na overleg met het uitvoerende hoofd van de betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie; en, indien tegen een functionaris een bevel tot uitwijzing wordt uitgevaardigd, heeft het uitvoerende hoofd van een gespecialiseerde organisatie het recht voor de persoon, tegen wie dit bevel is uitgevaardigd, in rechte te verschijnen.      

### Artikel  VIII  

####Laissez-passer

§ 26. De functionarissen van de gespecialiseerde organisaties zijn gerechtigd de laissez-passer van de Verenigde Naties te gebruiken overeenkomstig de te treffen administratieve regelingen tussen de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en de bevoegde autoriteiten van de gespecialiseerde organisaties, aan welke organisaties speciale bevoegdheden om de laissez-passer uit te geven zijn verleend. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties stelt iedere Staat, Partij van dit Verdrag, in kennis van de aldus getroffen administratieve regelingen. § 27. De Staten, Partij bij dit Verdrag, erkennen en aanvaarden de laissez-passer van de Verenigde Naties, die aan de functionarissen van de gespecialiseerde organisaties als geldige reispapieren zijn uitgereikt. § 28. Aanvragen om visa, indien deze nodig zijn, ingediend door functionarissen van gespecialiseerde organisaties, die een laissez-passer bezitten, worden, indien zij vergezeld zijn van een certificaat, dat de houders reizen voor zaken van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, met zo groot mogelijke spoed behandeld. Bovendien worden aan deze personen faciliteiten voor snel reizen verleend. § 29. Gelijksoortige faciliteiten, als bedoeld in § 28, worden toegekend aan deskundigen en andere personen, die, hoewel zij geen houders van een laissez-passer van de Verenigde Naties zijn, een certificaat hebben, dat zij reizen voor zaken van een gespecialiseerde organisatie. § 30. De uitvoerende hoofden, adjunct-uitvoerende hoofden, hoofden van afdelingen en andere functionarissen van een niet lagere rang dan die van hoofd van een afdeling van de gespecialiseerde organisaties, die op een laissez-passer reizen voor zaken van de gespecialiseerde organisaties, genieten dezelfde reis-faciliteiten als die, welke worden toegestaan aan ambtenaren van vergelijkbare rang, die deel uitmaken van diplomatieke zendingen.  

### Artikel  IX  

####Beslechting van geschillen

§ 31. De gespecialiseerde organisaties treffen regelingen voor passende wijzen van beslechting van: 

a. geschillen, die voortvloeien uit overeenkomsten of andere geschillen van privaatrechtelijke aard, waarbij de gespecialiseerde organisatie partij is;  

b. geschillen, waarbij een functionaris van een gespecialiseerde organisatie betrokken is, die krachtens zijn officiële positie immuniteit geniet, indien van de immuniteit niet volgens de bepalingen van § 22 is afstand gedaan.    § 32. Alle geschillen, welke voortkomen uit de uitlegging of toepassing van dit Verdrag, worden gebracht voor het Internationale Gerechtshof, tenzij in een bepaald geval tussen de partijen is overeengekomen, dat zij zullen overgaan tot een andere wijze van beslechting. Indien een geschil ontstaat tussen een gespecialiseerde organisatie enerzijds en een lid anderzijds, wordt een advies verzocht omtrent de hierbij betrokken rechtsquaesties overeenkomstig artikel 96 van het Handvest en artikel 65 van het Statuut van het Hof, alsmede overeenkomstig de desbetreffende bepalingen van de tussen de Verenigde Naties en de betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie getroffen overeenkomsten. Het door het Hof gegeven advies wordt door de partijen als beslissend aanvaard.  

### Artikel  X  

####Aanhangsels en toepassing op elke gespecialiseerde organisatie

§ 33. Bij haar toepassing op elke gespecialiseerde organisatie gelden de standaardbepalingen, behoudens de wijzigingen voorkomende in de definitieve (of herziene) tekst van het op die organisatie betrekking hebbende aanhangsel, zoals in de § 36 en 38 bepaald is. § 34. De bepalingen van het Verdrag moeten, met betrekking tot de gespecialiseerde organisaties, worden uitgelegd in het licht van de functies, welke aan die organisatie in haar Statuut zijn toevertrouwd. § 35. De ontwerp-aanhangsels 1 tot 9 aan de daarin genoemde gespecialiseerde organisaties aanbevelen. In het geval van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, welke niet in § 1 met name genoemd is, doet de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties aan die organisatie een ontwerp-aanhangsel toekomen, welke door de Economische en Sociale Raad wordt aanbevolen. § 36. De definitieve tekst van elk aanhangsel is die, welke door de betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie overeenkomstig haar constitutionele procedure is goedgekeurd. Een afschrift van het aanhangsel, zoals dat door elke gespecialiseerde organisatie is goedgekeurd, wordt door de betrokken organisatie aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties gezonden en vervangt vervolgens het in § 35 bedoelde ontwerp. § 37. Dit Verdrag wordt van toepassing op elke gespecialiseerde organisatie, wanneer de organisatie de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties de definitieve tekst van het betreffende aanhangsel heeft doen toekomen en hem er van in kennis gesteld heeft dat zij de standaard-clausules aanvaardt, zoals die in dat aanhangsel zijn gewijzigd en zich verbindt de bepalingen van §§ 8, 18, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 42 en 45 (behoudens die wijzigingen van § 32, welke nodig mochten zijn om de definitieve tekst van het aanhangsel in overeenstemming te brengen met het Statuut der organisatie) uit te voeren, evenals die bepalingen van het aanhangsel, welke de organisatie verplichtingen opleggen. De Secretaris-Generaal doet aan alle Leden van de Verenigde Naties en aan andere Staten, leden van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, gewaarmerkte afschriften toekomen van alle aanhangsels, welke hem ingevolge deze paragraaf werden toegezonden, alsmede van de gewijzigde aanhangsels, welke hem ingevolge § 30 werden overgelegd. § 38. Wanneer een gespecialiseerde organisatie, na overlegging van het in § 36 bedoelde definitieve aanhangsel, daarin overeenkomstig haar constitutionele procedure wijzigingen goedkeurt, wordt het gewijzigde aanhangsel door haar aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties overgelegd. § 39. De bepalingen van dit Verdrag beperken of verkorten geenszins de voorrechten en immuniteiten, welke door een Staat aan een gespecialiceerde organisatie, of hierna zullen worden verleend op grond van de aanwezigheid van haar hoofdzetel of regionale bureaux in het gebied van die Staat. Dit verdrag wordt niet geacht het sluiten te verhinderen tussen een Staat, partij bij het Verdrag en een gespecialiseerde organisatie, van verdere overeenkomsten tot wijzigingen van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, of tot uitbreiding of vermindering van de daarbij verleende voorrechten en immuniteiten. § 40. Het is wel verstaan, dat de standaardbepalingen, zoals deze gewijzigd zijn door de definitieve tekst van een door een gespecialiseerde organisatie krachtens § 36 aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties toegezonden aanhangsel (of een krachtens § 38 toegezonden gewijzigd aanhangsel) moeten overeenstemmen met de bepalingen van het alsdan van kracht zijnde Statuut van de betrokken organisatie en dat, indien een wijziging van dat Statuut om het met die bepalingen in overeenstemming te brengen, die wijziging, overeenkomstig de constitutionele procedure van die organisatie van kracht dient te worden, alvorens het definitieve (of gewijzigde) aanhangsel wordt toegezonden. Geen enkele bepaling van het Statuut van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, noch een recht en verplichting, welke de organisatie overigens mocht bezitten, verkrijgen of op zich nemen, kunnen alleen door de werking van dit Verdrag worden tenietgedaan of verminderd.  

### Artikel  XI  

####Slotbepalingen

§ 41. Toetreding tot dit Verdrag door een Lid van de Verenigde Naties en (behoudens § 42) door een Staat lid van een gespecialiseerde organisatie geschiedt door het nederleggen van een akte van toetreding bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, welke in werking treedt op de datum van zijn nederlegging. § 42. Iedere betrokken gespecialiseerde organisatie zendt de tekst van dit Verdrag tezamen met de betreffende aanhangsels aan die van haar leden, welke niet lid van de Verenigde Naties zijn, en verzoekt hen tot het Verdrag toe te treden met betrekking tot die organisatie door de akte van toetreding neder te leggen, hetzij bij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, hetzij bij het uitvoerend hoofd van de gespecialiseerde organisatie. § 43.

Iedere Staat, Partij van dit Verdrag, kan zich vervolgens, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, verbinden de bepalingen van dit Verdrag toe te passen op een of meer andere gespecialiseerde organisaties. Deze kennisgeving treedt in werking op de datum, waarop zij door de Secretaris-Generaal ontvangen wordt. § 44. Dit Verdrag treedt voor iedere Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, met betrekking tot een gespecialiseerde organisatie in werking, wanneer het overeenkomstig § 37 op die organisatie van toepassing is geworden en de Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, zich verbonden heeft de bepalingen van dit Verdrag overeenkomstig § 43 op die organisatie toe te passen. § 45. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties geeft aan alle Leden van de Verenigde Naties en alle leden van de gespecialiseerde organisaties, zowel als aan de uitvoerende hoofden dier organisaties, kennis van het nederleggen van elke akte van toetreding, welke krachtens § 41 is ontvangen en van alle verdere schriftelijke kennisgevingen, welke krachtens § 43 ontvangen zijn. Het uitvoerende hoofd van een gespecialiseerde organisatie geeft de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en de leden van de betrokken organisatie kennis van de bij hem krachtens § 42 nedergelegde akten van toetreding. § 46. Het is wel verstaan, dat, wanneer een akte van toetreding of een verdere kennisgeving vanwege een Staat nedergelegd is, die Staat krachtens zijn eigen recht uitvoering kan geven aan de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, zoals die gewijzigd zijn door de definitieve tekst van de Aanhangsels betreffende die organisaties bedoeld in de akten van toetreding of verdere kennisgevingen. § 47. 

1. Behoudens de bepalingen van de leden 2 en 3 van deze paragraaf verbindt iedere Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, zich dit Verdrag toe te passen op elke in de akte van toetreding of verdere kennisgeving bedoelde gespecialiseerde organisatie, tot wanneer een gewijzigd verdrag of aanhangsel op die organisatie van toepassing is geworden en de betrokken Staat het gewijzigde Verdrag of aanhangsel aanvaard heeft. In het geval van een gewijzigd aanhangsel wordt de aanvaardingen door de Staten tot stand gebracht door een kennisgeving, gezonden aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties (schriftelijke verbintenis), welke in werking treedt op de datum, waarop zij door de Secretaris-Generaal ontvangen wordt.  

2. Iedere Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, welke geen lid is, of opgehouden heeft lid te zijn van een gespecialiseerde organisatie, kan evenwel de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties, en het uitvoerend hoofd van de betrokken organisatie, een schriftelijke kennisgeving doen toekomen, dat hij van plan is die organisatie de voordelen van dit Verdrag te ontzeggen met ingang van een bepaalde datum, welke niet vroeger mag vallen dan drie maanden na de datum van ontvangst der kennisgeving.  

3. Iedere Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, kan de voordelen van dit Verdrag onthouden aan elke gespecialiseerde organisatie, die haar betrekkingen met de Verenigde Naties verbroken heeft.  

4. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties doet aan alle Staten, Leden, Partij bij dit Verdrag, mededeling van elke kennisgeving, welke hem krachtens de bepalingen van deze paragraaf zijn toegezonden.   § 48. Op verzoek van een derde Staat, Partij bij dit Verdrag, roept de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties een conferentie bijeen, teneinde het Verdrag te wijzigen. § 49. De Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties zendt afschrift van dit Verdrag aan de gespecialiseerde organisaties en aan de Leden van de Verenigde Naties.
