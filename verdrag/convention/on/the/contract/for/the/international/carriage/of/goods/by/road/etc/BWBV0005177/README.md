##Verdrag betreffende de overeenkomst tot internationaal vervoer van goederen over de weg (CMR)

####CONVENTION ON THE CONTRACT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY ROAD (CMR)

PREAMBLE The Contracting Parties, Having recognized the desirability of standardizing the conditions governing the contract for the international carriage of goods by road, particularly with respect to the documents used for such carriage and to the carrier's liability,   Have agreed as follows:     
### CHAPTER  I  

####Scope of application

### Article  1  

1.  This Convention shall apply to every contract for the carriage of goods by road in vehicles for reward, when the place of taking over of the goods and the place designated for delivery, as specified in the contract, are situated in two different countries, of which at least one is a contracting country, irrespective of the place of residence and the nationality of the parties.   
2.  For the purposes of this Convention, “vehicles” means motor vehicles, articulated vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers as defined in article 4 of the Convention on Road Traffic dated 19 September 1949.   
3.  This Convention shall apply also where carriage coming within its scope is carried out by States or by governmental institutions or organizations.   
4.  This Convention shall not apply: 

(a) To carriage performed under the terms of any international postal convention;  

(b) To funeral consignments;  

(c) To furniture removal.     
5.  The Contracting Parties agree not to vary any of the provisions of this Convention by special agreements between two or more of them, except to make it inapplicable to their frontier traffic or to authorize the use in transport operations entirely confined to their territory of consignment notes representing a title to the goods.   

### Article  2  

1.  Where the vehicle containing the goods is carried over part of the journey by sea, rail, inland waterways or air, and except where the provisions of article 14 are applicable, the goods are not unloaded from the vehicle, this Convention shall nevertheless apply to the whole of the carriage. Provided that to the extent that is is proved that any loss, damage or delay in delivery of the goods which occurs during the carriage by the other means of transport was not caused by an act or omission of the carrier by road, but by some event which could only have occurred in the course of and by reason of the carriage by that other means of transport, the liability of the carrier by road shall be determined not by this Convention but in the manner in which the liability of the carrier by the other means of transport would have been determined if a contract for the carriage of the goods alone had been made by the sender with the carrier by the other means of transport in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law for the carriage of goods by that means of transport. If, however, there are no such prescribed conditions, the liability of the carrier by road shall be determined by this Convention.   
2.  If the carrier by road is also himself the carrier by the other means of transport, his liability shall also be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, but as if, in his capacities as carrier by road and as carrier by the other means of transport, he were two separate persons.   

### CHAPTER  II  

####Persons for whom the carrier is responsible

### Article  3  

For the purposes of this Convention the carrier shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of his agents and servants and of any other persons of whose services he makes use for the performance of the carriage, when such agents, servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their employment, as if such acts or omissions were his own.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####Conclusion and performance of the contract of carriage

### Article  4  

The contract of carriage shall be confirmed by the making out of a consignment note. The absence, irregularity or loss of the consignment note shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.  

### Article  5  

1.  The consignment note shall be made out in three original copies signed by the sender and by the carrier. These signatures may be printed or replaced by the stamps of the sender and the carrier if the law of the country in which the consignment note has been made out so permits. The first copy shall be handed to the sender, the second shall accompany the goods and the third shall be retained by the carrier.   
2.  When the goods which are to be carried have to be loaded in different vehicles, or are of different kinds or are divided into different lots, the sender or the carrier shall have the right to require a separate consignment note to be made out for each vehicle used, or for each kind or lot of goods.   

### Article  6  

1.  The consignment note shall contain the following particulars: 

(a) The date of the consignment note and the place at which it is made out;  

(b) The name and address of the sender;  

(c) The name and address of the carrier;  

(d) The place and the date of taking over of the goods and the place designated for delivery;  

(e) The name and address of the consignee;  

(f) The description in common use of the nature of the goods and the method of packing, and, in the case of dangerous goods, their generally recognized description:  

(g) The number of packages and their special marks and numbers;  

(h) The gross weight of the goods or their quantity otherwise expressed;  

(i) Charges relating to the carriage (carriage charges, supplementary charges, customs duties and other charges incurred from the making of the contract to the time of delivery);  

(j) The requisite instructions for Customs and other formalities;  

(k) A statement that the carriage is subject, notwithstanding any clause to the contrary, to the provisions of this Convention.     
2.  Where applicable, the consignment note shall also contain the following particulars: 

(a) A statement that trans-shipment is not allowed;  

(b) The charges which the sender undertakes to pay;  

(c) The amount of “cash on delivery” charges;  

(d) A declaration of the value of the goods and the amount representing special interest in delivery;  

(e) The sender's instructions to the carrier regarding insurance of the goods;  

(f) The agreed time-limit within which the carriage is to be carried out;  

(g) A list of the documents handed to the carrier.     
3.  The parties may enter in the consignment note any other particulars which they may deem useful.   

### Article  7  

1.  The sender shall be responsible for all expenses, loss and damage sustained by the carrier by reason of the inaccuracy or inadequacy of: 

(a) The particulars specified in article 6, paragraph 1, *(b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h)* and *(j)*;  

(b) The particulars specified in article 6, paragraph 2;  

(c) Any other particulars or instructions given by him to enable the consignment note to be made out or for the purpose of their being entered therein.     
2.  If, at the request of the sender, the carrier enters in the consignment note the particulars referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, he shall be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to have done so on behalf of the sender.   
3.  If the consignment note does not contain the statement specified in article 6, paragraph 1 (*k*), the carrier shall be liable for all expenses, loss and damage sustained through such omission by the person entitled to dispose of the goods.   

### Article  8  

1.  On taking over the goods, the carrier shall check: 

(a) The accuracy of the statements in the consignment note as to the number of packages and their marks and numbers, and  

(b) The apparent condition of the goods and their packaging.     
2.  Where the carrier has no reasonable means of checking the accuracy of the statements referred to in paragraph 1 *(a)* of this article, he shall enter his reservations in the consignment note together with the grounds on which they are based. He shall likewise specify the grounds for any reservations which he makes with regard to the apparent condition of the goods and their packaging. Such reservations shall not bind the sender unless he has expressly agreed to be bound by them in the consignment note.   
3.  The sender shall be entitled to require the carrier to check the gross weight of the goods or their quantity otherwise expressed. He may also require the contents of the packages to be checked. The carrier shall be entitled to claim the cost of such checking. The result of the checks shall be entered in the consignment note.   

### Article  9  

1.  The consignment note shall be *prima facie* evidence of the making of the contract of carriage, the conditions of the contract and the receipt of the goods by the carrier.   
2.  If the consignment note contains no specific reservations by the carrier, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the goods and their packaging appeared to be in good condition when the carrier took them over and that the number of packages, their marks and numbers corresponded with the statements in the consignment note.   

### Article  10  

The sender shall be liable to the carrier for damage to persons, equipment or other goods, and for any expenses due to defective packing of the goods, unless the defect was apparent or known to the carrier at the time when he took over the goods and he made no reservations concerning it.  

### Article  11  

1.  For the purposes of the Customs or other formalities which have to be completed before delivery of the goods, the sender shall attach the necessary documents to the consignment note or place them at the disposal of the carrier and shall furnish him with all the information which he requires.   
2.  The carrier shall not be under any duty to enquire into either the accuracy or the adequacy of such documents and information. The sender shall be liable to the carrier for any damage caused by the absence, inadequacy or irregularity of such documents and information, except in the case of some wrongful act or neglect on the part of the carrier.   
3.  The liability of the carrier for the consequences arising from the loss or incorrect use of the documents specified in and accompanying the consignment note or deposited with the carrier shall be that of an agent, provided that the compensation payable by the carrier shall not exceed that payable in the event of loss of the goods.   

### Article  12  

1.  The sender has the right to dispose of the goods, in particular by asking the carrier to stop the goods in transit, to change the place at which delivery is to take place or to deliver the goods to a consignee other than the consignee indicated in the consignment note.   
2.  This right shall cease to exist when the second copy of the consignment note is handed to the consignee or when the consignee exercises his right under article 13, paragraph 1; from that time onwards the carrier shall obey the orders of the consignee.   
3.  The consignee shall, however, have the right of disposal from the time when the consignment note is drawn up, if the sender makes an entry to that effect in the consignment note.   
4.  If in exercising his right of disposal the consignee has ordered the delivery of the goods to another person, that other person shall not be entitled to name other consignees.   
5.  The exercise of the right of disposal shall be subject to the following conditions: 

(a) That the sender or, in the case referred to in paragraph 3 of this article, the consignee who wishes to exercise the right produces the first copy of the consignment note on which the new instructions to the carrier have been entered and indemnifies the carrier against all expenses, loss and damage involved in carrying out such instructions;  

(b) That the carrying out of such instructions is possible at the time when the instructions reach the person who is to carry them out and does not either interfere with the normal working of the carrier's undertaking or prejudice the senders or consignees of other consignments;  

(c) That the instructions do not result in a division of the consignment.     
6.  When, by reason of the provisions of paragraph 5 *(b)* of this article, the carrier cannot carry out the instructions which he receives, he shall immediately notify the person who gave him such instructions.   
7.  A carrier who has not carried out the instructions given under the conditions provided for in this article, or who has carried them out without requiring the first copy of the consignment note to be produced, shall be liable to the person entitled to make a claim for any loss or damage caused thereby.   

### Article  13  

1.  After arrival of the goods at the place designated for delivery, the consignee shall be entitled to require the carrier to deliver to him, against a receipt, the second copy of the consignment note and the goods. If the loss of the goods is established or if the goods have not arrived after the expiry of the period provided for in article 19, the consignee shall be entitled to enforce in his own name against the carrier any rights arising from the contract of carriage.   
2.  The consignee who avails himself of the rights granted to him under paragraph 1 of this article shall pay the charges shown to be due on the consignment note, but in the event of dispute on this matter the carrier shall not be required to deliver the goods unless security has been furnished by the consignee.   

### Article  14  

1.  If for any reason it is or becomes impossible to carry out the contract in accordance with the terms laid down in the consignment note before the goods reach the place designated for delivery, the carrier shall ask for instructions from the person entitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with the provisions of article 12.   
2.  Nevertheless, if circumstances are such as to allow the carriage to be carried out under conditions differing from those laid down in the consignment note and if the carrier has been unable to obtain instructions in reasonable time from the person entitled to dispose of the goods in accordance with the provisions of article 12, he shall take such steps as seem to him to be in the best interests of the person entitled to dispose of the goods.   

### Article  15  

1.  Where circumstances prevent delivery of the goods after their arrival at the place designated for delivery, the carrier shall ask the sender for his instructions. If the consignee refuses the goods the sender shall be entitled to dispose of them without being obliged to produce the first copy of the consignment note.   
2.  Even if he has refused the goods, the consignee may nevertheless require delivery so long as the carrier has not received instructions to the contrary from the sender.   
3.  When circumstances preventing delivery of the goods arise after the consignee, in exercise of his rights under article 12, paragraph 3, has given an order for the goods to be delivered to another person, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall apply as if the consignee were the sender and that other person were the consignee.   

### Article  16  

1.  The carrier shall be entitled to recover the cost of his request for instructions and any expenses entailed in carrying out such instructions, unless such expenses were caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the carrier.   
2.  In the cases referred to in article 14, paragraph 1, and in article 15, the carrier may immediately unload the goods for account of the person entitled to dispose of them and thereupon the carriage shall be deemed to be at an end. The carrier shall then hold the goods on behalf of the person so entitled. He may however entrust them to a third party, and in that case he shall not be under any liability except for the exercise of reasonable care in the choice of such third party. The charges due under the consignment note and all other expenses shall remain chargeable against the goods.   
3.  The carrier may sell the goods, without awaiting instructions from the person entitled to dispose of them, if the goods are perishable or their condition warrants such a course, or when the storage expenses would be out of proportion to the value of the goods. He may also proceed to the sale of the goods in other cases if after the expiry of a reasonable period he has not received from the person entitled to dispose of the goods instructions to the contrary which he may reasonably be required to carry out.   
4.  If the goods have been sold pursuant to this article, the proceeds of sale, after deduction of the expenses chargeable against the goods, shall be placed at the disposal of the person entitled to dispose of the goods. If these charges exceed the proceeds of sale, the carrier shall be entitled to the difference.   
5.  The procedure in the case of sale shall be determined by the law or custom of the place where the goods are situated.   

### CHAPTER  IV  

####Liability of the carrier

### Article  17  

1.  The carrier shall be liable for the total or partial loss of the goods and for damage thereto occurring between the time when he takes over the goods and the time of delivery, as well as for any delay in delivery.   
2.  The carrier shall however be relieved of liability if the loss, damage or delay was caused by the wrongful act or neglect of the claimant, by the instructions of the claimant given otherwise than as the result of a wrongful act or neglect on the part of the carrier, by inherent vice of the goods or through circumstances which the carrier could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.   
3.  The carrier shall not be relieved of liability by reason of the defective condition of the vehicle used by him in order to perform the carriage, or by reason of the wrongful act or neglect of the person from whom he may have hired the vehicle or of the agents or servants of the latter.   
4.  Subject to article 18, paragraphs 2 to 5, the carrier shall be relieved of liability when the loss or damage arises from the special risks inherent in one or more of the following circumstances: 

(a) Use of open unsheeted vehicles, when their use has been expressly agreed and specified in the consignment note;  

(b) The lack of, or defective condition of packing in the case of goods which, by their nature, are liable to wastage or to be damaged when not packed or when not properly packed;  

(c) Handling, loading, stowage of unloading of the goods by the sender, the consignee or persons acting on behalf of the sender or the consignee;  

(d) The nature of certain kinds of goods which particularly exposes them to total or partial loss or to damage, especially through breakage, rust, decay, desiccation, leakage, normal wastage, or the action of moth or vermin;  

(e) Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks or numbers on the packages;  

(f) The carriage of livestock.     
5.  Where under this article the carrier is not under any liability in respect of some of the factors causing the loss, damage or delay, he shall only be liable to the extent that those factors for which he is liable under this article have contributed to the loss, damage or delay.   

### Article  18  

1.  The burden of proving that loss, damage or delay was due to one of the causes specified in article 17, paragraph 2, shall rest upon the carrier.   
2.  When the carrier establishes that in the circumstances of the case, the loss or damage could be attributed to one or more of the special risks referred to in article 17, paragraph 4, it shall be presumed that is was so caused. The claimant shall however be entitled to prove that the loss or damage was not, in fact, attributable either wholly or partly to one of these risks.   
3.  This presumption shall not apply in the circumstances set out in article 17, paragraph 4 (*a*), if there has been an abnormal shortage, or a loss of any package.   
4.  If the carriage is performed in vehicles specially equipped to protect the goods from the effects of heat, cold, variations in temperature or the humidity of the air, the carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article 17, paragraph 4 (*d*), unless he proves that all steps incumbent on him in the circumstances with respect to the choice, maintenance and use of such equipment were taken and that he complied with any special instructions issued to him.   
5.  The carrier shall not be entitled to claim the benefit of article 17, paragraph 4 (*f*), unless he proves that all steps normally incumbent on him in the circumstances were taken and that he complied with any special instructions issued to him.   

### Article  19  

Delay in delivery shall be said to occur when the goods have not been delivered within the agreed time-limit or when, failing an agreed time-limit, the actual duration of the carriage having regard to the circumstances of the case, and in particular, in the case of partial loads, the time required for making up a complete load in the normal way, exceeds the time it would be reasonable to allow a diligent carrier.  

### Article  20  

1.  The fact that goods have not been delivered within thirty days following the expiry of the agreed time-limit, or, if there is no agreed time-limit, within sixty days from the time when the carrier took over the goods, shall be conclusive evidence of the loss of the goods, and the person entitled to make a claim may thereupon treat them as lost.   
2.  The person so entitled may, on receipt of compensation for the missing goods, request in writing that he shall be notified immediately should the goods be recovered in the course of the year following the payment of compensation. He shall be given a written acknowledgement of such request.   
3.  Within the thirty days following receipt of such notification, the person entitled as aforesaid may require the goods to be delivered to him against payment of the charges shown to be due on the consignment note and also against refund of the compensation he received less any charges included therein but without prejudice to any claims to compensation for delay in delivery under article 23 and, where applicable, article 26.   
4.  In the absence of the request mentioned in paragraph 2 or of any instructions given within the period of thirty days specified in paragraph 3, or if the goods are not recovered until more than one year after the payment of compensation, the carrier shall be entitled to deal with them in accordance with the law of the place where the goods are situated.   

### Article  21  

Should the goods have been delivered to the consignee without collection of the “cash on delivery” charge which should have been collected by the carrier under the terms of the contract of carriage, the carrier shall be liable to the sender for compensation not exceeding the amount of such charge without prejudice to his right of action against the consignee.  

### Article  22  

1.  When the sender hands goods of a dangerous nature to the carrier, he shall inform the carrier of the exact nature of the danger and indicate, if necessary, the precautions to be taken. If this information has not been entered in the consignment note, the burden of proving, by some other means, that the carrier knew the exact nature of the danger constituted by the carriage of the said goods shall rest upon the sender or the consignee.   
2.  Goods of a dangerous nature which, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, the carrier did not know were dangerous, may, at any time or place, be unloaded, destroyed or rendered harmless by the carrier without compensation; further, the sender shall be liable for all expenses, loss or damage arising out of their handing over for carriage or of their carriage.   

### Article  23  

1.  When, under the provisions of this Convention, a carrier is liable for compensation in respect of total or partial loss of goods, such compensation shall be calculated by reference to the value of the goods at the place and time at which they were accepted for carriage.   
2.  The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price or, if there is no such price, according to the current market price or, if there is no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.   
3.  Compensation shall not, however, exceed 8.33 units of account per kilogram of gross weight short.   
4.  In addition, the carriage charges, Customs duties and other charges incurred in respect of the carriage of the goods shall be refunded in full in case of total loss and in proportion to the loss sustained in case of partial loss, but no further damages shall be payable.   
5.  In the case of delay, if the claimant proves that damage has resulted therefrom the carrier shall pay compensation for such damage not exceeding the carriage charges.   
6.  Higher compensation may only be claimed where the value of the goods or a special interest in delivery has been declared in accordance with articles 24 and 26.   
7.  The unit of account mentioned in this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amount mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article shall be converted into the national currency of the State of the Court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that currency on the date of the judgement or the date agreed upon by the Parties. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.   
8.  Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 7 of this article may, at the time of ratification of or accession to the Protocol to the CMR or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability provided for in paragraph 3 of this article to be applied in its territory shall be 25 monetary units. The monetary unit referred to in this paragraph corresponds to 10/31 gram of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the amount specified in this paragraph into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.   
9.  The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of this article and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 8 of this article shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State as far as possible the same real value for the amount in paragraph 3 of this article as is expressed there in units of account. States shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 7 of this article or the result of the conversion in paragraph 8 of this article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument referred to in article 3 of the Protocol to the CMR and whenever there is a change in either.   

### Article  24  

The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, declare in the consignment note a value for the goods exceeding the limit laid down in article 23, paragraph 3, and in that case the amount of the declared value shall be substituted for that limit.  

### Article  25  

1.  In case of damage, the carrier shall be liable for the amount by which the goods have diminished in value, calculated by reference to the value of the goods fixed in accordance with article 23, paragraphs 1, 2 and 4.   
2.  The compensation may not, however, exceed: 

(a) If the whole consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in the case of total loss;  

(b) If part only of the consignment has been damaged, the amount payable in the case of loss of the part affected.     

### Article  26  

1.  The sender may, against payment of a surcharge to be agreed upon, fix the amount of a special interest in delivery in the case of loss or damage or of the agreed time-limit being exceeded, by entering such amount in the consignment note.   
2.  If a declaration of a special interest in delivery has been made, compensation for the additional loss or damage proved may be claimed, up to the total amount of the interest declared, independently of the compensation provided for in articles 23, 24 and 25.   

### Article  27  

1.  The claimant shall be entitled to claim interest on compensation payable. Such interest, calculated at five per centum per annum, shall accrue from the date on which the claim was sent in writing to the carrier or, if no such claim has been made, from the date on which legal proceedings were instituted.   
2.  When the amounts on which the calculation of the compensation is based are not expressed in the currency of the country in which payment is claimed, conversion shall be at the rate of exchange applicable on the day and at the place of payment of compensation.   

### Article  28  

1.  In cases where, under the law applicable, loss, damage or delay arising out of carriage under this Convention gives rise to an extra-contractual claim, the carrier may avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude his liability or which fix or limit the compensation due.   
2.  In cases where the extra-contractual liability for loss, damage or delay of one of the persons for whom the carrier is responsible under the terms of article 3 is in issue, such person may also avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude the liability of the carrier or which fix or limit the compensation due.   

### Article  29  

1.  The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this chapter which exclude or limit his liability or which shift the burden of proof if the damage was caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seized of the case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct.   
2.  The same provision shall apply if the wilful misconduct or default is committed by the agents of servants of the carrier or by any other persons of whose services he makes use for the performance of the carriage, when such agents, servants or other persons are acting within the scope of their employment. Furthermore, in such a case such agents, servants or other persons shall not be entitled to avail themselves, with regard to their personal liability, of the provisions of this chapter referred to in paragraph 1.   

### CHAPTER  V  

####Claims and actions

### Article  30  

1.  If the consignee takes delivery of the goods without duly checking their condition with the carrier or without sending him reservations giving a general indication of the loss or damage, not later than the time of delivery in the case of apparent loss or damage and within seven days of delivery, Sundays and public holidays excepted, in the case of loss or damage which is not apparent, the fact of his taking delivery shall be *prima facie* evidence that he has received the goods in the condition described in the consignment note. In the case of loss or damage which is not apparent the reservation referred to shall be made in writing.   
2.  When the condition of the goods has been duly checked by the consignee and the carrier, evidence contradicting the result of this checking shall only be admissible in the case of loss or damage which is not apparent and provided that the consignee has duly sent reservations in writing to the carrier within seven days, Sundays and public holidays excepted, from the date of checking.   
3.  No compensation shall be payable for delay in delivery unless a reservation has been sent in writing to the carrier, within twenty-one days from the time that the goods were placed at the disposal of the consignee.   
4.  In calculating the time-limits provided for in this article the date of delivery, or the date of checking, or the date when the goods were placed at the disposal of the consignee, as the case may be, shall not be included.   
5.  The carrier and the consignee shall give each other every reasonable facility for making the requisite investigations and checks.   

### Article  31  

1.  In legal proceedings arising out of carriage under this Convention, the plaintiff may bring an action in any court or tribunal of a contracting country designated by agreement between the parties and, in addition, in the courts or tribunals of a country within whose territory: 

(a) The defendant is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or the branch or agency through which the contract of carriage was made, or  

(b) The place where the goods were taken over by the carrier or the place designated for delivery is situated,   and in no other courts or tribunals.   
2.  Where in respect of a claim referred to in paragraph 1 of this article an action is pending before a court or tribunal competent under that paragraph, or where in respect of such a claim a judgement has been entered by such a court or tribunal no new action shall be started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the judgement of the court or tribunal before which the first action was brought is not enforceable in the country in which the fresh proceedings are brought.   
3.  When a judgement entered by a court or tribunal of a contracting country in any such action as is referred to in paragraph 1 of this article has become enforceable in that country, it shall also become enforceable in each of the other contracting States, as soon as the formalities required in the country concerned have been complied with. These formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.   
4.  The provisions of paragraph 3 of this article shall apply to judgements after trial, judgements by default and settlements confirmed by an order of the court, but shall not apply to interim judgements or to awards of damages, in addition to costs against a plaintiff who wholly or partly fails in his action.   
5.  Security for costs shall not be required in proceedings arising out of carriage under this Convention from nationals of contracting countries resident or having their place of business in one other of those countries.   

### Article  32  

1.  The period of limitation for an action arising out of carriage under this Convention shall be one year. Nevertheless, in the case of wilful misconduct, or such default as in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seised of the case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct, the period of limitation shall be three years. The period of limitation shall begin to run: 

(a) In the case of partial loss, damage or delay in delivery, from the date of delivery;  

(b) In the case of total loss, from the thirtieth day after the expiry of the agreed time-limit or where there is no agreed time-limit from the sixtieth day from the date on which the goods were taken over by the carrier;  

(c) In all other cases, on the expiry of a period of three months after the making of the contract of carriage.   The day on which the period of limitation begins to run shall not be included in the period.   
2.  A written claim shall suspend the period of limitation until such date as the carrier rejects the claim by notification in writing and returns the documents attached thereto. If a part of the claim is admitted the period of limitation shall start to run again only in respect of that part of the claim still in dispute. The burden of proof of the receipt of the claim, or of the reply and of the return of the documents, shall rest with the party relying upon these facts. The running of the period of limitation shall not be suspended by further claims having the same object.   
3.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, the extension of the period of limitation shall be governed by the law of the court or tribunal seised of the case. That law shall also govern the fresh accrual of rights of action.   
4.  A right of action which has become barred by lapse of time may not be exercised by way of counter-claim or set-off.   

### Article  33  

The contract of carriage may contain a clause conferring competence on an arbitration tribunal if the clause conferring competence on the tribunal provides that the tribunal shall apply this Convention.  

### CHAPTER  VI  

####Provisions relating to carriage performed by successive carriers

### Article  34  

If carriage governed by a single contract is performed by successive road carriers, each of them shall be responsible for the performance of the whole operation, the second carrier and each succeeding carrier becoming a party to the contract of carriage, under the terms of the consignment note, by reason of his acceptance of the goods and the consignment note.  

### Article  35  

1.  A carrier accepting the goods from a previous carrier shall give the latter a dated and signed receipt He shall enter his name and address on the second copy of the consignment note. Where applicable, he shall enter on the second copy of the consignment note and on the receipt reservations of the kind provided for in article 8, paragraph 2.   
2.  The provisions of article 9 shall apply to the relations between successive carriers.   

### Article  36

### Article  37  

A carrier who has paid compensation in compliance with the provisions of this Convention, shall be entitled to recover such compensation, together with interest thereon and all costs and expenses incurred by reason of the claim, from the other carriers who have taken part in the carriage, subject to the following provisions: 

(a) The carrier responsible for the loss or damage shall be solely liable for the compensation whether paid by himself or by another carrier;  

(b) When the loss or damage has been caused by the action of two or more carriers, each of them shall pay an amount proportionate to his share of liability; should it be impossible to apportion the liability, each carrier shall be liable in proportion to the share of the payment for the carriage which is due to him;  

(c) If it cannot be ascertained to which carriers liability is attributable for the loss or damage, the amount of the compensation shall be apportioned between all the carriers as laid down in (*b*) above.    

### Article  38  

If one of the carriers is insolvent, the share of the compensation due from him and unpaid by him shall be divided among the other carriers in proportion to the share of the payment for the carriage due to them.  

### Article  39  

1.  No carrier against whom a claim is made under articles 37 and 38 shall be entitled to dispute the validity of the payment made by the carrier making the claim if the amount of the compensation was determined by judicial authority after the first mentioned carrier had been given due notice of the proceedings and afforded an opportunity of entering an appearance.   
2.  A carrier wishing to take proceedings to enforce his right of recovery may make his claim before the competent court or tribunal of the country in which one of the carriers concerned is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business or the branch or agency through which the contract of carriage was made. All the carriers concerned may be made defendants in the same action.   
3.  The provisions of article 31, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall apply to judgements entered in the proceedings referred to in articles 37 and 38.   
4.  The provisions of article 32 shall apply to claims between carriers. The period of limitation shall, however, begin to run either on the date of the final judicial decision fixing the amount of compensation payable under the provisions of this Convention, or, if there is no such judicial decision, from the actual date of payment.   

### Article  40  

Carriers shall be free to agree among themselves on provisions other than those laid down in articles 37 and 38.

####VERDRAG BETREFFENDE DE OVEREENKOMST TOT INTERNATIONAAL VERVOER VAN GOEDEREN OVER DE WEG (CMR)

PREAMBULE De Verdragsluitende Partijen, Erkend hebbende het nut om de voorwaarden van de overeenkomst tot internationaal vervoer van goederen over de weg, in het bijzonder voor wat betreft de voor dit vervoer te gebruiken documenten en de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder, op eenvormige wijze te regelen,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Toepasselijkheid

### Artikel  1  

1.  Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op iedere overeenkomst onder bezwarende titel voor het vervoer van goederen over de weg door middel van voertuigen, wanneer de plaats van inontvangstneming der goederen en de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering, zoals deze zijn aangegeven in de overeenkomst, gelegen zijn in twee verschillende landen, waarvan tenminste één een bij het Verdrag partij zijnd land is, ongeacht de woonplaats en de nationaliteit van partijen.   
2.  Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag wordt onder „voertuigen” verstaan: de motorrijtuigen, gelede voertuigen, aanhangwagens en opleggers, zoals deze zijn omschreven in artikel 4 van het Verdrag nopens het wegverkeer van 19 september 1949.   
3.  Dit Verdrag is eveneens van toepassing, indien het vervoer, dat binnen zijn werkingssfeer valt, wordt bewerkstelligd door Staten of door Regeringsinstellingen of -organisaties.   
4.  Dit Verdrag is niet van toepassing: 

a) op vervoer, bewerkstelligd overeenkomstig internationale postovereenkomsten,  

b) op vervoer van lijken,  

c) op verhuizingen.     
5.  De Verdragsluitende Partijen komen overeen, dat dit Verdrag niet door bijzondere overeenkomsten, gesloten tussen twee of meer van haar, zal worden gewijzigd, tenzij om aan de werking daarvan haar grensverkeer te onttrekken of om voor vervoer, dat uitsluitend over haar grondgebied plaats heeft, het gebruik van een de goederen vertegenwoordigende vrachtbrief toe te staan.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Wanneer het voertuig, waarin de goederen zich bevinden, over een gedeelte van het traject wordt vervoerd over zee, per spoor, over de binnenwateren of door de lucht, zonder dat de goederen - behoudens ter toepassing van de bepalingen van artikel 14 - uit dat voertuig worden uitgeladen, blijft dit Verdrag niettemin van toepassing op het gehele vervoer. Voorzover evenwel wordt bewezen dat verlies, beschadiging of vertraging in de aflevering van de goederen, ontstaan tijdens het vervoer op andere wijze dan over de weg, niet is veroorzaakt door een daad of nalatigheid van de wegvervoerder en voortspruit uit een feit, dat zich alleen heeft kunnen voordoen tijdens en tengevolge van het vervoer anders dan over de weg, wordt de aansprakelijkheid van de wegvervoerder niet bepaald door dit Verdrag, maar op de wijze waarop de aansprakelijkheid van de niet-wegvervoerder zou zijn bepaald, zo een vervoerovereenkomst tussen de afzender en de niet-wegvervoerder tot vervoer van de goederen alleen zou zijn afgesloten overeenkomstig de wettelijke bepalingen van dwingend recht betreffende het vervoer van goederen op die andere wijze. Bij gebreke van dergelijke bepalingen wordt de aansprakelijkheid van de wegvervoerder echter bepaald door dit Verdrag.   
2.  Indien de wegvervoerder zelf het gedeelte van het vervoer dat niet over de weg plaats vindt bewerkstelligt, wordt zijn aansprakelijkheid eveneens bepaald volgens het eerste lid, als werden zijn hoedanigheden van wegvervoerder en niet-wegvervoerder uitgeoefend door twee verschillende personen.   

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Personen voor wie de vervoerder aansprakelijk is

### Artikel  3  

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag is de vervoerder, als ware het voor zijn eigen daden en nalatigheden, aansprakelijk voor de daden en nalatigheden van zijn ondergeschikten en van alle andere personen, van wie hij zich voor de bewerkstelliging van het vervoer bedient, wanneer deze ondergeschikten of deze personen handelen in de uitoefening van hun werkzaamheden.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####Sluiting en uitvoering van de vervoerovereenkomst

### Artikel  4  

De vervoerovereenkomst wordt vastgelegd in een vrachtbrief. De afwezigheid, de onregelmatigheid of het verlies van de vrachtbrief tast noch het bestaan noch de geldigheid aan van de vervoerovereenkomst, die onderworpen blijft aan de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

### Artikel  5  

1.  De vrachtbrief wordt opgemaakt in drie oorspronkelijke exemplaren, ondertekend door de afzender en de vervoerder. Deze ondertekening kan worden gedrukt of vervangen door de stempels van de afzender en de vervoerder, indien de wetgeving van het land, waar de vrachtbrief wordt opgemaakt, zulks toelaat. Het eerste exemplaar wordt overhandigd aan de afzender, het tweede begeleidt de goederen en het derde wordt door de vervoerder behouden.   
2.  Wanneer de te vervoeren goederen moeten worden geladen in verschillende voertuigen of wanneer het verschillende soorten goederen of afzonderlijke partijen betreft, heeft de afzender of de vervoerder het recht om te eisen, dat er evenzoveel vrachtbrieven worden opgemaakt als er voertuigen moeten worden gebruikt of als er soorten of partijen goederen zijn.   

### Artikel  6  

1.  De vrachtbrief moet de volgende aanduidingen bevatten: 

a) de plaats en de datum van het opmaken daarvan,  

b) de naam en het adres van de afzender,  

c) de naam en het adres van de vervoerder,  

d) de plaats en de datum van inontvangstneming der goederen en de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering der goederen,  

e) de naam en het adres van de geadresseerde,  

f) de gebruikelijke aanduiding van de aard der goederen en de wijze van verpakking en, voor gevaarlijke goederen, hun algemeen erkende benaming,  

g) het aantal colli, hun bijzondere merken en hun nummers,  

h) het bruto-gewicht of de op andere wijze aangegeven hoeveelheid van de goederen,  

i) de op het vervoer betrekking hebbende kosten (vrachtprijs, bijkomende kosten, douane-rechten en andere vanaf de sluiting van de overeenkomst tot aan de aflevering opkomende kosten),  

j) de voor het vervullen van douane- en andere formaliteiten nodige instructies,  

k) de aanduiding, dat het vervoer, ongeacht enig tegenstrijdig beding, is onderworpen aan de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.     
2.  Als het geval zich voordoet, moet de vrachtbrief nog de volgende aanduidingen bevatten: 

a) het verbod van overlading,  

b) de kosten, welke de afzender voor zijn rekening neemt,  

c) het bedrag van het bij de aflevering van de goederen te innen remboursement,  

d) de gedeclareerde waarde der goederen en het bedrag van het bijzonder belang bij de aflevering,  

e) de instructies van de afzender aan de vervoerder voor wat betreft de verzekering der goederen,  

f) de overeengekomen termijn, binnen welke het vervoer moet zijn volbracht,  

g) de lijst van bescheiden, welke aan de vervoerder zijn overhandigd.     
3.  De partijen kunnen in de vrachtbrief iedere andere aanduiding, welke zij nuttig achten, opnemen.   

### Artikel  7  

1.  De afzender is aansprakelijk voor alle kosten en schaden, welke door de vervoerder worden geleden tengevolge van de onnauwkeurigheid of de onvolledigheid: 

a) van de aanduidingen, aangegeven in artikel 6, eerste lid onder *b), d), e), f), g), h)* en *j),*  

b) van de aanduidingen, aangegeven in artikel 6, tweede lid,  

c) van alle andere aanduidingen of instructies, welke hij verstrekt voor het opmaken van de vrachtbrief of om daarin te worden opgenomen.     
2.  Indien de vervoerder op verzoek van de afzender de vermeldingen, bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, in de vrachtbrief opneemt, wordt hij behoudens tegenbewijs geacht voor rekening van de afzender te handelen.   
3.  Indien de vrachtbrief niet de vermelding, bedoeld in artikel 6, eerste lid onder *k),* bevat, is de vervoerder aansprakelijk voor alle kosten en schaden, welke de rechthebbende op de goederen door deze nalatigheid lijdt.   

### Artikel  8  

1.  Bij de inontvangstneming der goederen is de vervoerder gehouden te onderzoeken: 

a) de juistheid van de vermeldingen in de vrachtbrief met betrekking tot het aantal colli en hun merken en nummers,  

b) de uiterlijke staat van de goederen en hun verpakking.     
2.  Indien de vervoerder geen redelijke middelen ter beschikking staan om de juistheid van de vermeldingen, bedoeld in het eerste lid onder *a)* van dit artikel, te onderzoeken, tekent hij in de vrachtbrief met redenen omkleed aan, welke voorbehouden hij maakt. Eveneens geeft hij de redenen aan voor alle voorbehouden, welke hij maakt ten aanzien van de uiterlijke staat van de goederen en van hun verpakking. Deze voorbehouden verbinden de afzender niet, indien zij niet uitdrukkelijk in de vrachtbrief door hem zijn aanvaard.   
3.  De afzender heeft het recht te eisen, dat de vervoerder het bruto-gewicht of de op andere wijze uitgedrukte hoeveelheid der goederen onderzoekt. Hij kan tevens een onderzoek van de inhoud der colli eisen. De vervoerder kan de kosten van het onderzoek in rekening brengen. Het resultaat van de onderzoekingen wordt in de vrachtbrief neergelegd.   

### Artikel  9  

1.  De vrachtbrief levert volledig bewijs, behoudens tegenbewijs, van de voorwaarden der overeenkomst en van de ontvangst van de goederen door de vervoerder.   
2.  Bij gebreke van vermelding in de vrachtbrief van gemotiveerde voorbehouden van de vervoerder wordt vermoed, dat de goederen en hun verpakking in uiterlijk goede staat waren op het ogenblik van de inontvangstneming door de vervoerder en dat het aantal colli en hun merken en nummers in overeenstemming waren met de opgaven in de vrachtbrief.   

### Artikel  10  

De afzender is jegens de vervoerder aansprakelijk voor de schade aan personen, materiaal of aan andere goederen en de kosten, welke voortspruiten uit de gebrekkige verpakking van de goederen, tenzij de gebrekkigheid zichtbaar of aan de vervoerder bekend was op het ogenblik van de inontvangstneming en de vervoerder te dien aanzien geen voorbehouden heeft gemaakt.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Ter voldoening aan douane- en andere formaliteiten, welke vóór de aflevering van de goederen moeten worden vervuld, moet de afzender de nodige bescheiden bij de vrachtbrief voegen of ter beschikking van de vervoerder stellen en hem alle gewenste inlichtingen verschaffen.   
2.  De vervoerder is niet gehouden de nauwkeurigheid en de volledigheid van deze bescheiden en inlichtingen te onderzoeken. De afzender is jegens de vervoerder aansprakelijk voor alle schaden, die kunnen voortspruiten uit de afwezigheid, onvolledigheid of onregelmatigheid van deze bescheiden en inlichtingen, behoudens in geval van schuld van de vervoerder.   
3.  De vervoerder is op dezelfde voet als een commissionnair aansprakelijk voor de gevolgen van verlies of onjuiste behandeling van de bescheiden, die in de vrachtbrief zijn vermeld en deze begeleiden of in zijn handen zijn gesteld. De door hem verschuldigde schadevergoeding mag evenwel die, verschuldigd in geval van verlies van de goederen, niet overschrijden.   

### Artikel  12  

1.  De afzender heeft het recht over de goederen te beschikken, in het bijzonder door van de vervoerder te vorderen dat hij het vervoer ophoudt, de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering der goederen wijzigt of de goederen aflevert aan een andere geadresseerde dan in de vrachtbrief is aangegeven.   
2.  Dit recht vervalt, wanneer het tweede exemplaar van de vrachtbrief aan de geadresseerde is overhandigd of wanneer deze gebruik maakt van het recht bedoeld in artikel 13, eerste lid; vanaf dat ogenblik moet de vervoerder zich houden aan de opdrachten van de geadresseerde.   
3.  Het beschikkingsrecht komt evenwel reeds vanaf het opmaken van de vrachtbrief aan de geadresseerde toe, wanneer een vermelding in die zin door de afzender op de vrachtbrief is gesteld.   
4.  Indien de geadresseerde bij de uitoefening van zijn beschikkingsrecht bepaalt, dat de goederen aan een andere persoon moeten worden afgeleverd, kan deze persoon geen andere geadresseerde aanwijzen.   
5.  De uitoefening van het beschikkingsrecht is onderworpen aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

a) de afzender of, in het geval bedoeld in het derde lid van dit artikel, de geadresseerde, die dit recht wenst uit te oefenen, moet het eerste exemplaar van de vrachtbrief, waarop de aan de vervoerder gegeven nieuwe instructies moeten zijn aangetekend, overleggen en de vervoerder schadeloos stellen voor kosten en schade die de uitvoering van deze instructies meebrengt;  

b) de uitvoering van deze instructies moet mogelijk zijn op het ogenblik, dat de instructies de persoon, die deze moet uitvoeren, bereiken en zij mag noch de normale bedrijfsvoering van de vervoerder beletten noch schade toebrengen aan afzenders of geadresseerden van andere zendingen;  

c) de instructies mogen nimmer het verdelen van de zending tot gevolg hebben.     
6.  Wanneer de vervoerder tengevolge van de bepalingen van het vijfde lid onder *b)* van dit artikel de instructies, die hij ontvangt, niet kan uitvoeren, moet hij onmiddellijk de persoon, van wie deze instructies afkomstig zijn, daarvan in kennis stellen.   
7.  De vervoerder, die de volgens de voorwaarden van dit artikel gegeven instructies niet heeft uitgevoerd of die dergelijke instructies heeft opgevolgd zonder overlegging van het eerste exemplaar van de vrachtbrief te hebben geëist, is tegenover de rechthebbende aansprakelijk voor de hierdoor veroorzaakte schade.   

### Artikel  13  

1.  Na aankomst van de goederen op de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering, heeft de geadresseerde het recht van de vervoerder te vorderen dat het tweede exemplaar van de vrachtbrief aan hem wordt overhandigd en de goederen aan hem worden afgeleverd, een en ander tegen ontvangstbewijs. Wanneer verlies van de goederen is vastgesteld of de goederen aan het einde van de termijn, bedoeld in artikel 19, niet zijn aangekomen, is de geadresseerde gerechtigd om op eigen naam tegenover de vervoerder gebruik te maken van de rechten, die uit de vervoerovereenkomst voortspruiten.   
2.  De geadresseerde, die gebruik maakt van de rechten, die hem ingevolge het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn toegekend, is gehouden de volgens de vrachtbrief verschuldigde bedragen te betalen. In geval van geschil terzake is de vervoerder niet verplicht om de goederen af te leveren dan tegen zekerheidstelling door de geadresseerde.   

### Artikel  14  

1.  Indien, om welke reden ook, de uitvoering van de overeenkomst op de voorwaarden van de vrachtbrief onmogelijk is of wordt voordat de goederen op de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering, zijn aangekomen, is de vervoerder gehouden instructies te vragen aan de persoon, die het recht heeft overeenkomstig artikel 12 over de goederen te beschikken.   
2.  Indien evenwel de omstandigheden de uitvoering van het vervoer toelaten op andere voorwaarden dan die van de vrachtbrief en indien de vervoerder niet tijdig instructies heeft kunnen verkrijgen van de persoon, die het recht heeft overeenkomstig artikel 12 over de goederen te beschikken, neemt hij de maatregelen, welke hem het beste voorkomen in het belang van de persoon, die het recht heeft over de goederen te beschikken.   

### Artikel  15  

1.  Wanneer na aankomst van de goederen op de plaats van bestemming zich omstandigheden voordoen die de aflevering beletten, vraagt de vervoerder instructies aan de afzender. Indien de geadresseerde de goederen weigert, heeft de afzender het recht om daarover te beschikken zonder verplicht te zijn het eerste exemplaar van de vrachtbrief te tonen.   
2.  De geadresseerde kan, zelfs indien hij de goederen heeft geweigerd, te allen tijde de aflevering daarvan vragen, zolang de vervoerder geen andersluidende instructies van de afzender heeft ontvangen.   
3.  Indien een omstandigheid, die de aflevering belet, zich voordoet, nadat de geadresseerde overeenkomstig zijn recht ingevolge artikel 12, derde lid, opdracht heeft gegeven om de goederen aan een andere persoon af te leveren, treedt voor de toepassing van het eerste en tweede lid van dit artikel de geadresseerde in de plaats van de afzender en die andere persoon in de plaats van de geadresseerde.   

### Artikel  16  

1.  De vervoerder heeft recht op vergoeding van de kosten, welke zijn verzoek om instructies of de uitvoering van ontvangen instructies voor hem meebrengt, mits deze kosten niet door zijn schuld zijn ontstaan.   
2.  In de gevallen, bedoeld in artikel 14, eerste lid, en in artikel 15, kan de vervoerder de goederen onmiddellijk voor rekening van de rechthebbende lossen; na deze lossing wordt het vervoer geacht te zijn geëindigd. De vervoerder neemt dan de bewaring van de goederen op zich. Hij kan de goederen evenwel aan een derde toevertrouwen en is dan slechts aansprakelijk voor een oordeelkundige keuze van deze derde. De goederen blijven belast met volgens de vrachtbrief verschuldigde bedragen en alle andere kosten.   
3.  De vervoerder kan zonder instructies van de rechthebbende af te wachten tot verkoop van de goederen overgaan, wanneer de bederfelijke aard of de staat van de goederen dit rechtvaardigt of wanneer de kosten van bewaring onevenredig hoog zijn in verhouding tot de waarde van de goederen. In andere gevallen kan hij eveneens tot verkoop overgaan, wanneer hij niet binnen een redelijke termijn van de rechthebbende andersluidende instructies heeft ontvangen, waarvan de uitvoering redelijkerwijs kan worden gevorderd.   
4.  Indien de goederen ingevolge dit artikel zijn verkocht, moet de opbrengst van de verkoop ter beschikking van de rechthebbende worden gesteld onder aftrek van de kosten, die op de goederen drukken. Indien deze kosten de opbrengst van de verkoop te boven gaan, heeft de vervoerder recht op het verschil.   
5.  De verkoop geschiedt op de wijze bepaald door de wet of de gebruiken van de plaats, waar de goederen zich bevinden.   

### HOOFDSTUK  IV  

####Aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder

### Artikel  17  

1.  De vervoerder is aansprakelijk voor geheel of gedeeltelijk verlies en voor beschadiging van de goederen, welke ontstaan tussen het ogenblik van de inontvangstneming van de goederen en het ogenblik van de aflevering, alsmede voor vertraging in de aflevering.   
2.  De vervoerder is ontheven van deze aansprakelijkheid, indien het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging is veroorzaakt door schuld van de rechthebbende, door een opdracht van deze, welke niet het gevolg is van schuld van de vervoerder, door een eigen gebrek van de goederen of door omstandigheden, die de vervoerder niet heeft kunnen vermijden en waarvan hij de gevolgen niet heeft kunnen verhinderen.   
3.  De vervoerder kan zich niet aan zijn aansprakelijkheid onttrekken door een beroep te doen op gebreken van het voertuig, waarvan hij zich bedient om het vervoer te bewerkstelligen, of op fouten van de persoon, van wie hij het voertuig heeft gehuurd of van diens ondergeschikten.   
4.  Met inachtneming van artikel 18, tweede tot vijfde lid, is de vervoerder ontheven van zijn aansprakelijkheid, wanneer het verlies of de beschadiging een gevolg is van de bijzondere gevaren, eigen aan één of meer van de volgende omstandigheden: 

a) gebruik van open en niet met een dekzeil afgedekte voertuigen, wanneer dit gebruik uitdrukkelijk is overeengekomen en in de vrachtbrief is vermeld;  

b) ontbreken of gebrekkigheid van de verpakking bij goederen, die door hun aard aan kwaliteitsverlies of beschadiging zijn blootgesteld, wanneer zij niet of slecht verpakt zijn;  

c) behandeling, lading, stuwing of lossing van de goederen door de afzender, de geadresseerde of personen, die voor rekening van de afzender of de geadresseerde handelen;  

d) de aard van bepaalde goederen, die door met deze aard zelf samenhangende oorzaken zijn blootgesteld hetzij aan geheel of gedeeltelijk verlies hetzij aan beschadiging, in het bijzonder door breuk, roest, bederf, uitdroging, lekkage, normaal kwaliteitsverlies, of optreden van ongedierte en knaagdieren;  

e) onvolledigheid of gebrekkigheid van de merken of nummers der colli;  

f) vervoer van levende dieren.     
5.  Indien ingevolge dit artikel de vervoerder niet aansprakelijk is voor sommige der factoren, die de schade hebben veroorzaakt, is hij slechts aansprakelijk in evenredigheid tot de mate, waarin de factoren waarvoor hij ingevolge dit artikel aansprakelijk is, tot de schade hebben bijgedragen.   

### Artikel  18  

1.  Het bewijs, dat het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging door één der in artikel 17, tweede lid, genoemde feiten is veroorzaakt, rust op de vervoerder.   
2.  Wanneer de vervoerder aantoont, dat, gelet op de omstandigheden van het geval, het verlies of de beschadiging een gevolg heeft kunnen zijn van een of meer van de in artikel 17, vierde lid, genoemde bijzondere gevaren, wordt vermoed dat deze daarvan de oorzaak zijn. De rechthebbende kan evenwel bewijzen, dat de schade geheel of gedeeltelijk niet door een van deze gevaren veroorzaakt is.   
3.  Het hierboven genoemde vermoeden bestaat niet in het in artikel 17, vierde lid, onder *a*, genoemde geval, indien zich een ongewoon groot tekort of een verlies van colli voordoet.   
4.  Indien het vervoer wordt bewerkstelligd door middel van een voertuig, ingericht om de goederen te onttrekken aan de invloed van hitte, koude, temperatuurverschillen of vochtigheid van de lucht, kan de vervoerder geen beroep doen op het voorrecht van artikel 17, vierde lid, onder *d*, tenzij hij bewijst, dat alle maatregelen, waartoe hij, rekening houdende met de omstandigheden, verplicht was, zijn genomen met betrekking tot de keuze, het onderhoud en het gebruik van deze inrichtingen en dat hij zich heeft gericht naar de bijzondere instructies, die hem mochten zijn gegeven.   
5.  De vervoerder kan geen beroep doen op het voorrecht van artikel 17, vierde lid, onder *ƒ*, tenzij hij bewijst, dat alle maatregelen, waartoe hij normaliter, rekening houdende met de omstandigheden, verplicht was, zijn genomen en dat hij zich heeft gericht naar de bijzondere instructies, die hem mochten zijn gegeven.   

### Artikel  19  

Er is vertraging in de aflevering, wanneer de goederen niet zijn afgeleverd binnen de bedongen termijn of, bij gebreke van zulk een termijn, wanneer de werkelijke duur van het vervoer, zo men rekening houdt met de omstandigheden en met name, bij gedeeltelijke lading, met de tijd benodigd voor het verkrijgen van een volledige lading op de gebruikelijke voorwaarden, meer tijd vergt dan een goed vervoerder redelijkerwijs behoort te worden toegestaan.  

### Artikel  20  

1.  De rechthebbende kan, zonder enig nader bewijs, de goederen als verloren beschouwen, wanneer zij niet zijn afgeleverd binnen dertig dagen na afloop van de bedongen termijn, of, bij gebreke van zulk een termijn, binnen zestig dagen na de inontvangstneming van de goederen door de vervoerder.   
2.  De rechthebbende kan bij ontvangst van de schadevergoeding voor de verloren goederen schriftelijk verzoeken hem onmiddellijk te berichten ingeval de goederen worden teruggevonden in de loop van het jaar, volgende op de betaling der schadevergoeding. Dit verzoek wordt hem schriftelijk bevestigd.   
3.  Binnen dertig dagen na ontvangst van dit bericht kan de rechthebbende vorderen, dat de goederen aan hem worden afgeleverd tegen betaling van de volgens de vrachtbrief verschuldigde bedragen en tegen teruggave van de schadevergoeding, die hij heeft ontvangen, onder aftrek van de kosten, welke in deze schadevergoeding mochten zijn begrepen, en met behoud van alle rechten op schadevergoeding voor vertraging in de aflevering ingevolge artikel 23 en, indien toepasselijk, ingevolge artikel 26.   
4.  Bij gebreke hetzij van het verzoek, bedoeld in het tweede lid, hetzij van instructies gegeven binnen de termijn van dertig dagen, bedoeld in het derde lid, of ook, indien de goederen eerst meer dan een jaar na betaling van de schadevergoeding zijn teruggevonden, kan de vervoerder over de goederen beschikken overeenkomstig de wet van de plaats, waar deze zich bevinden.   

### Artikel  21  

Indien de goederen aan de geadresseerde zijn afgeleverd zonder inning van het remboursement, dat door de vervoerder volgens de bepalingen van de vervoerovereenkomst zou moeten zijn ontvangen, is de vervoerder gehouden de afzender schadeloos te stellen tot ten hoogste het bedrag van het remboursement, onverminderd zijn verhaal op de geadresseerde.  

### Artikel  22  

1.  Indien de afzender aan de vervoerder gevaarlijke goederen aanbiedt, licht hij hem in over de juiste aard van het gevaar, dat zij opleveren, en geeft hij, zo nodig, de te nemen voorzorgsmaatregelen aan. Indien deze inlichting niet in de vrachtbrief is vermeld, staat het aan de afzender of de geadresseerde met enig ander middel te bewijzen, dat de vervoerder kennis heeft gedragen van de juiste aard van het gevaar, dat het vervoer van de voornoemde goederen opleverde.   
2.  De gevaarlijke goederen, die niet, gegeven het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel, als zodanig aan de vervoerder bekend waren, kunnen op ieder ogenblik en op iedere plaats door de vervoerder worden gelost, vernietigd of onschadelijk gemaakt en wel zonder enige schadevergoeding; de afzender is bovendien aansprakelijk voor alle kosten en schaden, voortvloeiende uit de aanbieding ten vervoer of uit het vervoer zelf.   

### Artikel  23  

1.  Wanneer ingevolge de bepalingen van dit Verdrag een schadevergoeding voor geheel of gedeeltelijk verlies van de goederen ten laste van de vervoerder wordt gebracht, wordt deze schadevergoeding berekend naar de waarde van de goederen op de plaats en het tijdstip van de inontvangstneming.   
2.  De waarde van de goederen wordt vastgesteld volgens de beurskoers of, bij gebreke daarvan, volgens de gangbare marktprijs of, bij gebreke van een en ander, volgens de gebruikelijke waarde van goederen van dezelfde aard en kwaliteit.   
3.  De schadevergoeding kan evenwel niet meer bedragen dan 8.33 rekeneenheden voor elk ontbrekend kilogram bruto-gewicht.   
4.  Bovendien worden de vrachtprijs, de douanerechten en de overige met betrekking tot het vervoer der goederen gemaakte kosten, in geval van geheel verlies volledig en in geval van gedeeltelijk verlies naar verhouding, terugbetaald; verdere schadevergoeding is niet verschuldigd.   
5.  In geval van vertraging is, indien de rechthebbende bewijst, dat daardoor schade is ontstaan, de vervoerder gehouden voor deze schade een vergoeding te betalen, die niet meer kan bedragen dan de vrachtprijs.   
6.  Hogere vergoedingen kunnen slechts worden gevorderd in geval van aangifte van de waarde der goederen of van een bijzonder belang bij de aflevering, overeenkomstig de artikelen 24 en 26.   
7.  De in dit Verdrag genoemde rekeneenheid is het bijzondere trekkingsrecht zoals dit is omschreven door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds. Het in het derde lid van dit artikel genoemde bedrag wordt omgerekend in de nationale munteenheid van de Staat van het gerecht, waarvoor de vordering aanhangig is, volgens de waarde van die munteenheid op de datum van het vonnis of de datum, die de Partijen zijn overeengekomen. De waarde van de nationale munteenheid, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, van een Staat, die lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend overeenkomstig de waarderingsmethode die door het Internationale Monetaire Fonds op de desbetreffende datum wordt toegepast voor zijn eigen verrichtingen en transacties. De waarde van de nationale munteenheid, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, van een Staat, die geen lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds, wordt berekend op eendoor die Staat vastgestelde wijze.   
8.  Niettemin kan een Staat, die geen lid is van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en waarvan de wet de toepassing van de bepalingen van het zevende lid van dit artikel niet toelaat, op het tijdstip van bekrachtiging van of toetreding tot het Protocol bij het CMR, of op enig tijdstip nadien, verklaren dat de in het derde lid van dit artikel bedoelde aansprakelijkheidsgrens, die op zijn grondgebied van toepassing is, 25 monetaire eenheden bedraagt. De in dit lid bedoelde monetaire eenheid komt overeen met 10/31 gram goud van een gehalte van 0,900. De omrekening van het in dit lid genoemde bedrag in de nationale munteenheid geschiedt volgens de wet van de betrokken Staat.   
9.  De in de laatste zin van het zevende lid van dit artikel genoemde berekening en de in het achtste lid van dit artikel genoemde omrekening geschieden op zodanige wijze, dat in de nationale munteenheid van de Staat zo veel mogelijk dezelfde werkelijke waarde tot uitdrukking komt voor het bedrag genoemd in het derde lid van dit artikel, als daarin uitgedrukt in rekeneenheden. Bij nederlegging van een in artikel 3 van het Protocol bij het CMR genoemde akte en telkens wanneer een verandering optreedt in hun wijze van berekening ingevolge het zevende lid van dit artikel of in het resultaat van de omrekening ingevolge het achtste lid van dit artikel, delen de Staten de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties hun wijze van berekening dan wel het resultaat van de omrekening mede.   

### Artikel  24  

De afzender kan tegen betaling van een overeengekomen toeslag in de vrachtbrief een waarde van de goederen aangeven, die het maximum, vermeld in het derde lid van artikel 23, overschrijdt. In dat geval treedt het aangegeven bedrag in de plaats van dit maximum.  

### Artikel  25  

1.  In geval van beschadiging vergoedt de vervoerder het bedrag van de waardevermindering, berekend naar de volgens artikel 23, eerste, tweede en vierde lid vastgestelde waarde der goederen.   
2.  De schadevergoeding beloopt evenwel niet meer dan de volgende bedragen: 

a) indien de gehele zending door de beschadiging in waarde is verminderd, het bedrag, dat zij zou hebben belopen in geval van geheel verlies;  

b) indien slechts een gedeelte van de zending door de beschadiging in waarde is verminderd, het bedrag, dat zij zou hebben belopen in geval van verlies van het in waarde verminderd gedeelte.     

### Artikel  26  

1.  De afzender kan tegen betaling van een overeengekomen toeslag het bedrag van een bijzonder belang bij de aflevering voor het geval van verlies of beschadiging en voor dat van overschrijding van de overeengekomen termijn, vaststellen door vermelding van dit bedrag in de vrachtbrief.   
2.  Indien een bijzonder belang bij de aflevering is aangegeven, kan, onafhankelijk van de schadevergoedingen, bedoeld in de artikelen 23, 24 en 25, en tot ten hoogste het bedrag van het aangegeven belang, een schadevergoeding worden gevorderd gelijk aan de bewezen bijkomende schade.   

### Artikel  27  

1.  De rechthebbende kan over het bedrag der schadevergoeding rente vorderen. Deze rente, ten bedrage van vijf procent per jaar, loopt vanaf de dag waarop de vordering schriftelijk bij de vervoerder is ingediend of, indien dit niet is geschied, vanaf de dag waarop zij in rechte aanhangig is gemaakt.   
2.  Wanneer de bedragen, die tot grondslag voor de berekening der schadevergoeding dienen, niet zijn uitgedrukt in de munt van het land, waar de betaling wordt gevorderd, geschiedt de omrekening volgens de koers van de dag en de plaats van betaling der schadevergoeding.   

### Artikel  28  

1.  Wanneer het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging, ontstaan in de loop van een aan dit Verdrag onderworpen vervoer, volgens de toepasselijke wet kan leiden tot een vordering, die niet op de vervoerovereenkomst is gegrond, kan de vervoerder zich beroepen op de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, die zijn aansprakelijkheid uitsluiten of de verschuldigde schadevergoedingen vaststellen of beperken.   
2.  Wanneer de niet op de vervoerovereenkomst berustende aansprakelijkheid voor verlies, beschadiging of vertraging, van één der personen voor wie de vervoerder ingevolge artikel 3 aansprakelijk is, in het geding is, kan deze persoon zich eveneens beroepen op de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, die de aansprakelijkheid van de vervoerder uitsluiten of de verschuldigde schadevergoedingen vaststellen of beperken.   

### Artikel  29  

1.  De vervoerder heeft niet het recht om zich te beroepen op de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk, die zijn aansprakelijkheid uitsluiten of beperken of die de bewijslast omkeren, indien de schade voortspruit uit zijn opzet of uit schuld zijnerzijds, welke volgens de wet van het gerecht, waar de vordering aanhangig is, met opzet gelijkgesteld wordt.   
2.  Hetzelfde geldt bij opzet of schuld van de ondergeschikten van de vervoerder of van alle andere personen, van wier diensten hij voor de bewerkstelliging van het vervoer gebruik maakt, wanneer deze ondergeschikten of deze andere personen handelen in de uitoefening van hun werkzaamheden. In dat geval hebben deze ondergeschikten of andere personen eveneens niet het recht om zich, voor wat hun persoonlijke aansprakelijkheid betreft, te beroepen op de bepalingen van dit hoofdstuk, als omschreven in het eerste lid.   

### HOOFDSTUK  V  

####Vorderingen in en buiten rechte

### Artikel  30  

1.  Indien de geadresseerde de goederen in ontvangst heeft genomen zonder dat hij ten overstaan van de vervoerder de staat daarvan heeft vastgesteld of zonder dat hij, indien het zichtbare verliezen of beschadigingen betreft, uiterlijk op het ogenblik van de aflevering, of, indien het onzichtbare verliezen of beschadigingen betreft, binnen zeven dagen na de aflevering, zon- en feestdagen niet inbegrepen, voorbehouden ter kennis van de vervoerder heeft gebracht, waarin de algemene aard van hel verlies of de beschadiging is aangegeven, wordt hij behoudens tegenbewijs geacht de goederen te hebben ontvangen in de staat als omschreven in de vrachtbrief. De bovenbedoelde voorbehouden moeten, indien het onzichtbare verliezen of beschadigingen betreft, schriftelijk worden gemaakt.   
2.  Wanneer de staat van de goederen door de geadresseerde ten overstaan van de vervoerder is vastgesteld, is geen tegenbewijs tegen het resultaat van deze vaststelling toegelaten, tenzij het onzichtbare verliezen of beschadigingen betreft en de geadresseerde schriftelijke voorbehouden ter kennis van de vervoerder heeft gebracht binnen zeven dagen, zon- en feestdagen niet inbegrepen, na deze vaststelling.   
3.  Bij vertraging in de aflevering is schadevergoeding alleen verschuldigd, indien binnen een termijn van 21 dagen nadat de goederen ter beschikking van de geadresseerde zijn gesteld, een schriftelijk voorbehoud ter kennis van de vervoerder is gebracht.   
4.  Bij het bepalen van de termijnen ingevolge dit artikel wordt de datum van aflevering of, al naar het geval, de datum van vaststelling of die van terbeschikkingstelling niet meegerekend.   
5.  De vervoerder en de geadresseerde verlenen elkaar alle redelijke faciliteiten voor de nodige vaststellingen en onderzoekingen.   

### Artikel  31  

1.  Alle rechtsgedingen, waartoe het aan dit Verdrag onderworpen vervoer aanleiding geeft, kunnen door de eiser behalve voor de gerechten van de bij dit Verdrag partij zijnde landen, bij beding tussen partijen aangewezen, worden gebracht voor de gerechten van het land op het grondgebied waarvan: 

a) de gedaagde zijn gewone verblijfplaats, zijn hoofdzetel of het filiaal of agentschap heeft, door bemiddeling waarvan de vervoerovereenkomst is gesloten, of  

b) de plaats van inontvangstneming der goederen of de plaats bestemd voor de aflevering der goederen, is gelegen;   zij kunnen voor geen andere gerechten worden gebracht.   
2.  Wanneer in een rechtsgeding, bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, een vordering aanhangig is voor een volgens dat lid bevoegd gerecht, of wanneer in een zodanig geding door een zodanig gerecht een uitspraak is gedaan, kan geen nieuwe vordering omtrent hetzelfde onderwerp tussen dezelfde partijen worden ingesteld, tenzij de uitspraak van het gerecht, waarvoor de eerste vordering aanhangig is gemaakt, niet vatbaar is voor tenuitvoerlegging in het land, waarin de nieuwe vordering wordt ingesteld.   
3.  Wanneer in een rechtsgeding, bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel, een uitspraak, gedaan door een gerecht van een bij het Verdrag partij zijnd land, in dat land uitvoerbaar is geworden, wordt zij eveneens uitvoerbaar in elk ander bij het Verdrag partij zijnd land, zodra de aldaar terzake voorgeschreven formaliteiten zijn vervuld. Deze formaliteiten kunnen geen hernieuwde behandeling van de zaak meebrengen.   
4.  De bepalingen van het derde lid van dit artikel zijn van toepassing op uitspraken op tegenspraak gewezen, op uitspraken bij verstek en op schikkingen, aangegaan ten overstaan van de rechter, maar zij zijn niet van toepassing op uitspraken die slechts bij voorraad uitvoerbaar zijn, noch op veroordelingen tot vergoeding van schaden en interessen, welke boven de kosten zijn uitgesproken tegen een eiser wegens de gehele of gedeeltelijke afwijzing van zijn vordering.   
5.  Van onderdanen van bij het Verdrag partij zijnde landen, die hun woonplaats of een bedrijf hebben in een van deze landen, kan geen zekerheidstelling voor de betaling der proceskosten worden gevorderd in rechtsgedingen, waartoe een aan dit Verdrag onderworpen vervoer aanleiding geeft.   

### Artikel  32  

1.  De rechtsvorderingen, waartoe een aan dit Verdrag onderworpen vervoer aanleiding geeft, verjaren door verloop van een jaar. In geval van opzet of van schuld, welke volgens de wet van het gerecht, waarvoor de vordering aanhangig is, met opzet gelijkgesteld wordt, is de verjaringstermijn drie jaar. De verjaring loopt: 

a) in geval van gedeeltelijk verlies, beschadiging of vertraging, vanaf de dag, waarop de goederen zijn afgeleverd;  

b) in geval van volledig verlies, vanaf de dertigste dag na afloop van de bedongen termijn of, bij gebreke van zulk een termijn, vanaf de zestigste dag na de inontvangstneming van de goederen door de vervoerder;  

c) in alle andere gevallen, na afloop van een termijn van drie maanden na de sluiting der vervoerovereenkomst.   De hierboven als begin van de verjaring aangegeven dag wordt niet begrepen in de verjaringstermijn.   
2.  Een schriftelijke vordering schorst de verjaring tot aan de dag, waarop de vervoerder de vordering schriftelijk afwijst en de daarbij gevoegde stukken terugzendt. In geval van gedeeltelijke aanvaarding van de vordering hervat de verjaring haar loop alleen voor het deel van de vordering, dat betwist blijft. Het bewijs van ontvangst van de vordering of van het antwoord en van het terugzenden der stukken rust op de partij, die dit feit inroept. Verdere, op hetzelfde onderwerp betrekking hebbende vorderingen schorsen de verjaring niet.   
3.  Met inachtneming van de bepalingen van het tweede lid, wordt de schorsing van de verjaring beheerst door de wet van het gerecht waarvoor de zaak aanhangig is. Hetzelfde geldt voor de stuiting van de verjaring.   
4.  Een verjaarde vordering kan ook niet meer in de vorm van een vordering in reconventie of van een exceptie worden geldend gemaakt.   

### Artikel  33  

De vervoerovereenkomst kan een bepaling bevatten inzake het toekennen van bevoegdheid aan een scheidsgerecht, mits deze bepaling inhoudt, dat het scheidsgerecht dit Verdrag zal toepassen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VI  

####Bepalingen nopens vervoer verricht door opvolgende vervoerders

### Artikel  34  

Indien een vervoer, onderworpen aan één enkele overeenkomst, wordt bewerkstelligd door opvolgende wegvervoerders, worden de tweede en ieder van de volgende vervoerders door inontvangstneming van de goederen en van de vrachtbrief partij bij de overeenkomst op de voorwaarden van de vrachtbrief en wordt ieder van hen aansprakelijk voor de bewerkstelliging van het gehele vervoer.  

### Artikel  35  

1.  De vervoerder, die de goederen van de voorafgaande vervoerder in ontvangst neemt, overhandigt hem een gedateerd en ondertekend ontvangstbewijs. Hij moet zijn naam en adres op het tweede exemplaar van de vrachtbrief vermelden. Indien daartoe aanleiding is, tekent hij op dat exemplaar alsmede op het ontvangstbewijs soortgelijke voorbehouden aan als die, bedoeld in artikel 8, tweede lid.   
2.  De bepalingen van artikel 9 zijn op de betrekkingen tussen opvolgende vervoerders van toepassing.   

### Artikel  36  

Behoudens in het geval van een eis in reconventie of van een exceptie, opgeworpen in een rechtsgeding inzake een eis, welke is gebaseerd op dezelfde vervoerovereenkomst, kan de vordering tot aansprakelijkstelling voor verlies, beschadiging of vertraging slechts worden gericht tegen de eerste vervoerder, de laatste vervoerder of de vervoerder, die het deel van het vervoer bewerkstelligde, gedurende hetwelk het feit, dat het verlies, de beschadiging of de vertraging heeft veroorzaakt, zich heeft voorgedaan; de vordering kan tegelijkertijd tegen verschillenden van deze vervoerders worden ingesteld.  

### Artikel  37  

De vervoerder, die een schadevergoeding heeft betaald uit hoofde van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, heeft recht van verhaal voor de hoofdsom, rente en kosten tegen de vervoerders, die aan de uitvoering van de vervoerovereenkomst hebben deelgenomen, overeenkomstig de volgende bepalingen: 

a) de vervoerder, door wiens toedoen de schade is veroorzaakt, draagt de schadevergoeding alleen, onverschillig of deze door hemzelf of door een andere vervoerder is betaald;  

b) wanneer de schade is veroorzaakt door toedoen van twee of meer vervoerders, moet ieder van hen een bedrag betalen in verhouding tot zijn deel van de aansprakelijkheid; indien begroting van de delen der aansprakelijkheid niet mogelijk is, is ieder van hen aansprakelijk in verhouding tot het hem toekomende deel van de beloning voor het vervoer;  

c) indien niet kan worden vastgesteld, aan wie van de vervoerders de aansprakelijkheid moet worden toegerekend, wordt het bedrag van de schadevergoeding verdeeld tussen alle vervoerders, in de verhouding bepaald onder *b)*.    

### Artikel  38  

Indien een van de vervoerders insolvent is, wordt het door hem verschuldigde deel, dat hij niet heeft betaald, tussen alle andere vervoerders verdeeld in verhouding tot hun beloning.  

### Artikel  39  

1.  De vervoerder, op wie verhaal wordt uitgeoefend ingevolge de artikelen 37 en 38, is niet gerechtigd de gegrondheid van de betaling door de vervoerder, die het verhaal uitoefent, te betwisten, wanneer de schadevergoeding is vastgesteld bij rechterlijke uitspraak, mits hij behoorlijk van het rechtsgeding in kennis is gesteld en hij gelegenheid heeft gehad om daarin zich te voegen of tussen te komen.   
2.  De vervoerder, die verhaal wil uitoefenen, kan zulks doen voor het bevoegde gerecht van het land, waarin een van de betrokken vervoerders zijn gewone verblijfplaats, zijn hoofdzetel of het filiaal of agentschap heeft, door bemiddeling waarvan de vervoerovereenkomst is gesloten. Het verhaal kan in een en hetzelfde geding tegen alle betrokken vervoerders worden gericht.   
3.  De bepalingen van artikel 31, derde en vierde lid, zijn van toepassing op rechterlijke uitspraken, gegeven terzake van het verhaal ingevolge de artikelen 37 en 38.   
4.  De bepalingen van artikel 32 zijn van toepassing op het verhaal tussen vervoerders. De verjaring loopt evenwel hetzij vanaf de dag van een rechterlijke einduitspraak tot vaststelling van de ingevolge de bepalingen van dit Verdrag te betalen schadevergoeding hetzij, bij gebreke van zulk een uitspraak, vanaf de dag waarop de betaling is geschied.   

### Artikel  40  

De vervoerders kunnen onderling een van de artikelen 37 en 38 afwijkende regeling bedingen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  VII  

####Nietigheid van bedingen in strijd met het Verdrag

### Artikel  41  

1.  Behoudens de bepalingen van artikel 40 is nietig ieder beding, dat middellijk of onmiddellijk afwijkt van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag. De nietigheid van dergelijke bedingen heeft niet de nietigheid van de overige bepalingen van de overeenkomst tot gevolg.   
2.  In het bijzonder is nietig ieder beding, door hetwelk de vervoerder zich de rechten uit de verzekering der goederen laat overdragen of ieder ander beding van dergelijke strekking, evenals ieder beding, dat de bewijslast verplaatst.   

### HOOFDSTUK  VIII  

####Slotbepalingen

2.  Voor ieder land, dat het Verdrag bekrachtigt of ertoe toetreedt, nadat vijf landen hun akte van bekrachtiging of van toetreding hebben nedergelegd, treedt dit Verdrag in werking op de negentigste dag na de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding door het genoemde land.   

### Artikel  44

2.  De opzegging heeft rechtsgevolg twaalf maanden na de datum, waarop de Secretaris-Generaal de kennisgeving heeft ontvangen.   

### Artikel  45  

Indien na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag het aantal Verdragsluitende Partijen tengevolge van opzeggingen is teruggebracht tot minder dan vijf, houdt de werking van dit Verdrag op van de datum af, waarop de laatste opzegging rechtsgevolg heeft.  

### Artikel  46  

1.  Ieder land kan bij de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding of te eniger tijd daarna, door middel van een tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties gerichte kennisgeving verklaren, dat dit Verdrag van toepassing zal zijn op alle of een deel van de gebieden, welker internationale betrekkingen het behartigt.

2.  Ieder land, dat overeenkomstig het vorige lid een verklaring heeft afgelegd, waardoor dit Verdrag van toepassing wordt op een gebied, welks internationale betrekkingen het behartigt, kan overeenkomstig artikel 44 het Verdrag, voor wat dat gebied betreft, opzeggen.   

### Artikel  47  

Ieder geschil tussen twee of meer Verdragsluitende Partijen betreffende de uitleg of de toepassing van dit Verdrag, dat de Partijen niet door middel van onderhandelingen of door andere middelen hebben kunnen regelen, kan op verzoek van één der betrokken Verdragsluitende Partijen ter beslissing worden voorgelegd aan het Internationale Gerechtshof.  

### Artikel  48  

1.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij kan op het tijdstip, waarop zij dit Verdrag ondertekent of bekrachtigt of ertoe toetreedt, verklaren dat zij zich niet door artikel 47 van het Verdrag gebonden acht. De andere Verdragsluitende Partijen zijn niet door artikel 47 gebonden tegenover een Verdragsluitende Partij, die zulk een voorbehoud heeft gemaakt.   
2.  Iedere Verdragsluitende Partij die een voorbehoud overeenkomstig het eerste lid heeft gemaakt, kan te allen tijde dit voorbehoud intrekken door een tot de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties gerichte kennisgeving.
