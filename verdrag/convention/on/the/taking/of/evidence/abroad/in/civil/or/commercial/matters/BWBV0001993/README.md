##Verdrag inzake de verkrijging van bewijs in het buitenland in burgerlijke en in handelszaken

####Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters

The States signatory to the present Convention, Desiring to facilitate the transmission and execution of Letters of Request and to further the accommodation of the different methods which they use for this purpose, Desiring to improve mutual judicial co-operation in civil or commercial matters, Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions -     
### CHAPTER  I  

####LETTERS OF REQUEST

### Article  1  

In civil or commercial matters a judicial authority of a Contracting State may, in accordance with the provisions of the law of that State, request the competent authority of another Contracting State, by means of a Letter of Request, to obtain evidence, or to perform some other judicial act. A Letter shall not be used to obtain evidence which is not intended for use in judicial proceedings, commenced or contemplated. The expression 'other judicial act' does not cover the service of judicial documents or the issuance of any process by which judgments or orders are executed or enforced, or orders for provisional or protective measures.  

### Article  2  

A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority which will undertake to receive Letters of Request coming from a judicial authority of another Contracting State and to transmit them to the authority competent to execute them. Each State shall organize the Central Authority in accordance with its own law. Letters shall be sent to the Central Authority of the State of execution without being transsmitted through any other authority of that State.  

### Article  3  

A Letter of Request shall specify - 

(a) the authority requesting its execution and the authority requested to execute it, if known to the requesting authority;  

(b) the names and addresses of the parties to the proceedings and their representatives, if any;  

(c) the nature of the proceedings for which the evidence is required, giving all necessary information in regard thereto;  

(d) the evidence to be obtained or other judicial act to be performed.   Where appropriate, the Letter shall specify, inter alia - 

(e) the names and addresses of the persons to be examined;  

(f) the questions to be put to the persons to be examined or a statement of the subject-matter about which they are to be examined;  

(g) the documents or other property, real or personal, to be inspected;  

(h) any requirement that the evidence is to be given on oath or affirmation, and any special form to be used;  

(i) any special method or procedure to be followed under Article 9.   A Letter may also mention any information necessary for the application of Article 11. No legalization or other like formality may be required.  

### Article  4  

A Letter of Request shall be in the language of the authority requested to execute it or be accompanied by a translation into that language. Nevertheless, a Contracting State shall accept a Letter in either English or French, or a translation into one of these languages, unless it has made the reservation authorized by Article 33. A Contracting State which has more than one official language and cannot, for reasons of internal law, accept Letters in one of these languages for the whole of its territory, shall, by declaration, specify the language in which the Letter or translation thereof shall be expressed for execution in the specified parts of its territory. In case of failure to comply with this declaration, without justifiable excuse, the costs of translation into the required language shall be borne by the State of origin. A Contracting State may, by declaration, specify the language or languages other than those referred to in the preceding paragraphs, in which a Letter may be sent to its Central Authority. Any translation accompanying a Letter shall be certified as correct, either by a diplomatic officer or consular agent or by a sworn translator or by any other person so authorized in either State.  

### Article  5  

If the Central Authority considers that the request does not comply with the provisions of the present Convention, it shall promptly inform the authority of the State of origin which transmitted the Letter of Request, specifying the objections to the Letter.  

### Article  6  

If the authority to whom a Letter of Request has been transmitted is not competent to execute it, the Letter shall be sent forthwith to the authority in the same State which is competent to execute it in accordance with the provisions of its own law.  

### Article  7  

The requesting authority shall, if it so desires, be informed of the time when, and the place where, the proceedings will take place, in order that the parties concerned, and their representatives, if any, may be present. This information shall be sent directly to the parties or their representatives when the authority of the State of origin so requests.  

### Article  8  

A Contracting State may declare that members of the judicial personnel of the requesting authority of another Contracting State may be present at the execution of a Letter of Request. Prior authorization by the competent authority designated by the declaring State may be required.  

### Article  9  

The judicial authority which executes a Letter of Request shall apply its own law as to the methods and procedures to be followed. However, it will follow a request of the requesting authority that a special method or procedure be followed, unless this is incompatible with the internal law of the State of execution or is impossible of performance by reason of its internal practice and procedure or by reason of practical difficulties. A Letter of Request shall be executed expeditiously.  

### Article  10  

In executing a Letter of Request the requested authority shall apply the appropriate measures of compulsion in the instances and to the same extent as are provided by its internal law for the execution of orders issued by the authorities of its own country or of requests made by parties in internal proceedings.  

### Article  11  

In the execution of a Letter of Request the person concerned may refuse to give evidence in so far as he has a privilege or duty to refuse to give the evidence - 

(a) under the law of the State of execution; or  

(b) under the law of the State of origin, and the privilege or duty has been specified in the Letter, or, at the instance of the requested authority, has been otherwise confirmed to that authority by the requesting authority.   A Contracting State may declare that, in addition, it will respect privileges and duties existing under the law of States other than the State of origin and the State of execution, to the extent specified in that declaration.  

### Article  12  

The execution of a Letter of Request may be refused only to the extent that - 

(a) in the State of execution the execution of the Letter does not fall within the functions of the judiciary; or  

(b) the State addressed considers that its sovereignty or security would be prejudiced thereby.   Execution may not be refused solely on the ground that under its internal law the State of execution claims exclusive jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action or that its internal law would not admit a right of action on it.  

### Article  13  

The documents establishing the execution of the Letter of Request shall be sent by the requested authority to the requesting authority by the same channel which was used by the latter. In every instance where the Letter is not executed in whole or in part, the requesting authority shall be informed immediately through the same channel and advised of the reasons.  

### Article  14  

The execution of the Letter of Request shall not give rise to any reimbursement of taxes or costs of any nature. Nevertheless, the State of execution has the right to require the State of origin to reimburse the fees paid to experts and interpreters and the costs occasioned by the use of a special procedure requested by the State of origin under Article 9, paragraph 2. The requested authority whose law obliges the parties themselves to secure evidence, and which is not able itself to execute the Letter, may, after having obtained the consent of the requesting authority, appoint a suitable person to do so. When seeking this consent the requested authority shall indicate the approximate costs which would result from this procedure. If the requesting authority gives its consent it shall reimburse any costs incurred; without such consent the requesting authority shall not be liable for the costs.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####TAKING OF EVIDENCE BY DIPLOMATIC OFFICERS, CONSULAR AGENTS AND COMMISSIONERS

### Article  15  

In a civil or commercial matter, a diplomatic officer or consular agent of a Contracting State may, in the territory of another Contracting State and within the area where he exercises his functions, take the evidence without compulsion of nationals of a State which he represents in aid of proceedings commenced in the courts of a State which he represents. A Contracting State may declare that evidence may be taken by a diplomatic officer or consular agent only if permission to that effect is given upon application made by him or on his behalf to the appropriate authority designated by the declaring State.  

### Article  16  

A diplomatic officer or consular agent of a Contracting State may, in the territory of another Contracting State and within the area where he exercises his functions, also take the evidence, without compulsion, of nationals of the State in which he exercises his functions or of a third State, in aid of proceedings commenced in the courts of a State which he represents, if - 

(a) a competent authority designated by the State in which he exercises his functions has given its permission either generally or in the particular case, and  

(b) he complies with the conditions which the competent authority has specified in the permission.   A Contracting State may declare that evidence may be taken under this Article without its prior permission.  

### Article  17  

In a civil or commercial matter, a person duly appointed as a commissioner for the purpose may, without compulsion, take evidence in the territory of a Contracting State in aid of proceedings commenced in the courts of another Contracting State if - 

(a) a competent authority designated by the State where the evidence is to be taken has given its permission either generally or in the particular case; and  

(b) he complies with the conditions which the competent authority has specified in the permission.   A Contracting State may declare that evidence may be taken under this Article without its prior permission.  

### Article  18  

A Contracting State may declare that a diplomatic officer, consular agent or commissioner authorized to take evidence under Articles 15, 16 or 17, may apply to the competent authority designated by the declaring State for appropriate assistance to obtain the evidence by compulsion. The declaration may contain such conditions as the declaring State may see fit to impose. If the authority grants the application it shall apply any measures of compulsion which are appropriate and are prescribed by its law for use in internal proceedings.  

### Article  19  

The competent authority, in giving the permission referred to in Article 15, 16 or 17, or in granting the application referred to in Article 18, may lay down such conditions as it deems fit, *inter alia,* as to the time and place of the taking of the evidence. Similarly it may require that it be given reasonable advance notice of the time, date and place of the taking of the evidence; in such a case a representative of the authority shall be entitled to be present at the taking of the evidence.  

### Article  20  

In the taking of evidence under any Article of this Chapter persons concerned may be legally represented.  

### Article  21  

Where a diplomatic officer, consular agent or commissioner is authorized under Articles 15, 16 or 17 to take evidence - 

(a) he may take all kinds of evidence which are not incompatible with the law of the State where the evidence is taken or contrary to any permission granted pursuant to the above Articles, and shall have power within such limits to administer an oath or take an affirmation;  

(b) a request to a person to appear or to give evidence shall, unless the recipient is a national of the State where the action is pending, be drawn up in the language of the place where the evidence is taken or be accompanied by a translation into such language;  

(c) the request shall inform the person that he may be legally represented and, in any State that has not filed a declaration under Article 18, shall also inform him that he is not compelled to appear or to give evidence;  

(d) the evidence may be taken in the manner provided by the law applicable to the court in which the action is pending provided that such manner is not forbidden by the law of the State where the evidence is taken;  

(e) a person requested to give evidence may invoke the privileges and duties to refuse to give the evidence contained in Article 11.    

### Article  22  

The fact that an attempt to take evidence under the procedure laid down in this Chapter has failed, owing to the refusal of a person to give evidence, shall not prevent an application being subsequently made to take the evidence in accordance with Chapter I.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####GENERAL CLAUSES

####Verdrag inzake de verkrijging van bewijs in het buitenland in burgerlijke en in handelszaken

De Staten die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Geleid door de wens de overmaking en uitvoering van rogatoire commissies te vergemakkelijken en te bevorderen, dat de verschillende werkwijzen welke zij te dien einde volgen beter met elkaar in overeenstemming worden gebracht, Strevend naar verbetering van de wederzijdse samenwerking op het gebied van de rechtshulpverlening in burgerlijke en in handelszaken, Hebben besloten te dien einde een Verdrag tot stand te brengen en zijn het volgende overeengekomen:     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####ROGATOIRE COMMISSIES

### Artikel  1  

In burgerlijke en in handelszaken kan de rechterlijke autoriteit van een Verdragsluitende Staat overeenkomstig de wettelijke bepalingen van die Staat, bij wege van rogatoire commissie aan de bevoegde autoriteit van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat verzoeken, een handeling tot het verkrijgen van bewijs (onderzoekshandeling) of andere gerechtelijke handelingen te verrichten. Een onderzoekshandeling kan niet worden verzocht met het doel partijen in staat te stellen, zich bewijs te verschaffen dat niet bestemd is om te dienen tot gebruik in een reeds aanhangige of in een toekomstige procedure. De term „andere gerechtelijke handelingen" heeft geen betrekking op de betekening of kennisgeving van gerechtelijke stukken, noch op maatregelen tot bewaring van recht of tot tenuitvoerlegging.  

### Artikel  2  

Elke Verdragsluitende Staat wijst een Centrale Autoriteit aan, die belast is met het in ontvangst nemen van rogatoire commissies die afkomstig zijn van de rechterlijke autoriteit van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat, en met het overmaken daarvan aan de voor de uitvoering ervan bevoegde autoriteit. Iedere Staat organiseert de Centrale Autoriteit overeenkomstig de bepalingen van zijn eigen wetgeving. De rogatoire commissies worden aan de Centrale Autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat overgemaakt zonder tussenkomst van een andere autoriteit van die Staat.  

### Artikel  3  

De rogatoire commissie bevat de volgende gegevens: 

a) de verzoekende autoriteit en, indien mogelijk, de aangezochte autoriteit;  

b) de namen en adressen van de partijen en eventueel van hun vertegenwoordigers;  

c) de aard en het onderwerp van het geding en een beknopte uiteenzetting van de feiten;  

d) de onderzoekshandelingen of andere gerechtelijke handelingen die moeten worden verricht.   Voor zover nodig vermeldt de rogatoire commissie bovendien: 

e) de namen en adressen van de te horen personen;  

f) de vragen welke aan de te horen personen moeten worden gesteld, dan wel de feiten waarover zij moeten worden gehoord;  

g) de stukken of andere voorwerpen welke moeten worden onderzocht;  

h) het verzoek om de verklaring onder ede of belofte af te nemen en, eventueel, de formule die daarbij moet worden gebruikt;  

i) de bijzondere vormen waarvan de toepassing wordt verlangd overeenkomstig artikel 9.   De rogatoire commissie vermeldt eventueel tevens de inlichtingen welke nodig zijn voor de toepassing van artikel 11. Er kan geen legalisatie of andere vergelijkbare formaliteit worden verlangd.  

### Artikel  4  

De rogatoire commissie moet worden gesteld in de taal van de aangezochte autoriteit of vergezeld gaan van een vertaling in die taal. Evenwel moet elke Verdragsluitende Staat een rogatoire commissie die in het Frans of het Engels is gesteld of vergezeld is van een vertaling in een van deze talen aanvaarden, tenzij die Staat zich daartegen heeft verzet door het maken van het voorbehoud voorzien in artikel 33. Elke Verdragsluitende Staat die meer dan één officiële taal heeft en wegens redenen van zijn nationale wetgeving niet een rogatoire commissie voor zijn gehele grondgebied kan aanvaarden indien deze slechts in één van die talen is gesteld, moet door middel van een daartoe strekkende verklaring doen weten, in welke taal de rogatoire commissie moet worden gesteld of vertaald met het oog op de uitvoering ervan in de door die Staat aangewezen delen van zijn grond gebied. Indien de verplichting welke uit die verklaring voortvloeit zonder geldige reden niet is nageleefd, komen de kosten van de vertaling in de vereiste taal voor rekening van de Staat waarvan het verzoek is uitgegaan. Elke Verdragsluitende Staat kan door middel van een daartoe strekkende verklaring doen weten, in welke andere taal of talen dan die bedoeld in de voorgaande leden een rogatoire commissie aan zijn Centrale Autoriteit kan worden gericht. Elke aan een rogatoire commissie gehechte vertaling moet voor overeenstemmend zijn verklaard door een diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaar, door een beëdigd vertaler dan wel door enige andere daartoe in een van de beide Staten bevoegd verklaarde persoon.  

### Artikel  5  

Indien de Centrale Autoriteit van oordeel is dat de bepalingen van het Verdrag niet zijn geëerbiedigd, stelt zij de autoriteit van de verzoekende Staat die haar de rogatoire commissie heeft overgemaakt onverwijld daarvan in kennis en doet daarbij nauwkeurige opgave van de bezwaren welke tegen het verzoek zijn gerezen.  

### Artikel  6  

Ingeval van onbevoegdheid van de aangezochte autoriteit, wordt de rogatoire commissie ambtshalve en onverwijld overgedragen aan de rechterlijke autoriteit van dezelfde Staat, die volgens de bepalingen van diens wetgeving wel bevoegd is.  

### Artikel  7  

De verzoekende autoriteit wordt op haar verlangen ingelicht over het tijdstip waarop en de plaats waar de verlangde handeling zal worden verricht, opdat de belanghebbende partijen en eventueel hun vertegenwoordigers daarbij tegenwoordig kunnen zijn. Deze mededeling wordt rechtstreeks aan die partijen of hun vertegenwoordigers gedaan, wanneer de verzoekende autoriteit zulks heeft verzocht.  

### Artikel  8  

Elke Verdragsluitende Staat kan verklaren, dat rechterlijke ambtenaren van de verzoekende autoriteit van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat de uitvoering van een rogatoire commissie mogen bijwonen. Daaraan kan de Staat die zulk een verklaring heeft afgelegd de voorwaarde verbinden, dat vooraf toestemming moet zijn verleend door een door die Staat aangewezen bevoegde autoriteit.  

### Artikel  9  

De rechterlijke autoriteit die de rogatoire commissie uitvoert past, wat betreft de vormen waarin dit geschiedt, haar eigen landswet toe. Deze autoriteit zal evenwel gehoor geven aan de wens van de autoriteit waarvan het verzoek uitgaat om een speciale vorm toe te passen, tenzij deze onverenigbaar is met de wet van de aangezochte Staat, of de toepassing niet mogelijk is hetzij wegens de rechterlijke gebruiken van de aangezochte Staat, hetzij wegens praktische moeilijkheden. De rogatoire commissie moet onverwijld worden uitgevoerd.  

### Artikel  10  

Bij de uitvoering van de rogatoire commissie past de aangezochte autoriteit de daartoe passende dwangmiddelen toe welke in haar eigen wet zijn voorzien, in de gevallen en in gelijke mate als zij daartoe verplicht zou zijn bij de uitvoering van een dergelijk verzoek van de autoriteiten van de eigen Staat, of bij het gevolg geven aan een daartoe strekkend verzoek van een belanghebbende partij.  

### Artikel  11  

De rogatoire commissie wordt niet uitgevoerd, indien en voorzover de betrokken persoon zich beroept op een recht van verschoning of een verbod tot het afleggen van een verklaring gegrond op: 

a) de wet van de aangezochte Staat; of  

b) de wet van de verzoekende Staat, en het verschoningsrecht of het verbod is vermeld in de rogatoire commissie of, eventueel, op verzoek van de aangezochte autoriteit is bevestigd door de autoriteit waarvan het verzoek uitgaat.   Elke Verdragsluitende Staat kan verklaren, dat hij eveneens dergelijke verschoningsrechten en verboden erkent welke voorkomen in de wetten van andere Staten dan de Staat waaruit het verzoek afkomstig is en de aangezochte Staat, zulks in de mate waarin dit is aangegeven in die verklaring.  

### Artikel  12  

De uitvoering van de rogatoire commissie kan niet worden geweigerd dan in zoverre 

a) die uitvoering in de aangezochte Staat niet behoort tot de bevoegdheid van de rechterlijke macht; of  

b) de aangezochte Staat van oordeel is dat die uitvoering een inbreuk zou betekenen op zijn soevereiniteit of zijn veiligheid.   De uitvoering kan niet worden geweigerd op de enkele grond, dat de wet van de aangezochte Staat ten aanzien van de zaak waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft uitsluitende rechtsmacht voor die Staat op eist, dan wel een rechtsvordering als waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft niet toekent.  

### Artikel  13  

De stukken ten bewijze van de uitvoering van de rogatoire commissie worden door de aangezochte autoriteit aan de verzoekende autoriteit overgemaakt langs dezelfde weg die deze laatste heeft gebruikt. Wanneer de rogatoire commissie niet of slechts ten dele is uitgevoerd, wordt de verzoekende autoriteit daarvan onverwijld verwittigd langs dezelfde weg en de redenen daarvoor worden daarbij medegedeeld.  

### Artikel  14  

De uitvoering van de rogatoire commissie kan niet leiden tot terugbetaling van rechten of kosten van welke aard ook. Evenwel heeft de aangezochte Staat het recht van de verzoekende Staat de terugbetaling te verlangen van vergoedingen welke zijn betaald aan deskundigen en tolken, alsmede van de kosten welke zijn veroorzaakt door de toepassing van een bijzondere vorm welke door de verzoekende Staat verzocht is overeenkomstig het tweede lid van artikel 9. De aangezochte autoriteit welker wet het aan partijen overlaat de bewijzen te verzamelen en die niet in staat is zelf de rogatoire commissie uit te voeren, kan een daartoe geschikte persoon daarmede belasten na daartoe toestemming te hebben verkregen van de verzoekende autoriteit. Bij het verzoek tot een zodanige toestemming vermeldt de aangezochte autoriteit bij benadering de uit deze procedure voortvloeiende kosten. De toestemming brengt voor de verzoekende autoriteit de verplichting mee, die kosten terug te betalen. Is er geen toestemming verleend, dan kan de verzoekende autoriteit niet voor die kosten worden aangesproken.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####DE VERKRIJGING VAN BEWIJS DOOR DIPLOMATIEKE OF CONSULAIRE AMBTENAREN EN DOOR COMMISSARISSEN

### Artikel  15  

In burgerlijke en in handelszaken kan een diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaar van een Verdragsluitende Staat op het grondgebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat, binnen het ressort waar hij zijn functie uitoefent, zonder dwang elke onderzoekshandeling verrichten, mits daarbij slechts onderdanen van een Staat die hij vertegenwoordigt zijn betrokken en het een zaak betreft welke aanhangig is voor een gerecht van die Staat. Elke Verdragsluitende Staat heeft de bevoegdheid te verklaren dat deze handeling slechts kan worden verricht indien daartoe verlof is verleend, op een daartoe strekkend verzoek van deze ambtenaar zelf of te zijnen behoeve gedaan, door de bevoegde autoriteit welke door de Staat die deze verklaring heeft afgelegd is aangewezen.  

### Artikel  16  

Een diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaar van een Verdragsluitende Staat kan bovendien op het gebied van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat, binnen het ressort waar hij zijn functie uitoefent, zonder dwang onderzoekshandelingen verrichten waarbij onderdanen van de Staat waar hij zijn functie uitoefent of onderdanen van derde Staten zijn betrokken, ten behoeve van een zaak die aanhangig is voor een gerecht van een Staat die hij vertegenwoordigt:
