##Verdrag inzake het merken van kneedspringstoffen ten behoeve van de opsporing ervan

####Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection

The States Parties to this Convention, Conscious of the implications of acts of terrorism for international security; Expressing deep concern regarding terrorist acts aimed at destruction of aircraft, other means of transportation and other targets; Concerned that plastic explosives have been used for such terrorist acts; Considering that the marking of such explosives for the purpose of detection would contribute significantly to the prevention of such unlawful acts; Recognizing that for the purpose of deterring such unlawful acts there is an urgent need for an international instrument obliging States to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that plastic explosives are duly marked; Considering United Nations Security Council Resolution 635 of 14 June 1989, and. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 44/29 of 4 December 1989 urging the International Civil Aviation Organization to intensify its work on devising an international regime for the marking of plastic or sheet explosives for the purpose of detection; Bearing in mind Resolution A27-8 adopted unanimously by the 27th Session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization which endorsed with the highest and overriding priority the preparation of a new international instrument regarding the marking of plastic or sheet explosives for detection; Noting with satisfaction the role played by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization in the preparation of the Convention as well as its willingness to assume functions related to its implementation; Have agreed as follows:

b) are formulated with a binder material; and  

c) are, as a mixture, malleable or flexible at normal room temperature.    

### II  

The following explosives, even though meeting the description of explosives in paragraph I of this Part, shall not be considered to be explosives as long as they continue to be held or used for the purposes specified below or remain incorporated as there specified, namely those explosives that: 

a) are manufactured, or held, in limited quantities solely for use in duly authorized research, development or testing of new or modified explosives;  

b) are manufactured, or held, in limited quantities solely for use in duly authorized training in explosives detection and/or development or testing of explosives detection equipment;

####BESCHRIJVING VAN SPRINGSTOFFEN

### I  

De in artikel I, eerste lid, van dit Verdrag bedoelde springstoffen zijn springstoffen die: 

a. zijn samengesteld met een of meer brisante stoffen die in hun zuivere vorm een dampspanning hebben van minder dan 10 <sup>-4</sup> Pa bij een temperatuur van 25° C;  

b. zijn samengesteld met een bindmiddel; en  

c. als mengsel bij een normale kamertemperatuur kneedbaar of buigbaar zijn.    

### II  

De volgende springstoffen worden, ook al voldoen zij aan de beschrijving van springstoffen in paragraaf I van dit Deel, niet als springstoffen beschouwd zolang zij worden beheerd of gebruikt voor de hieronder gegeven doeleinden, of zolang zij behoren tot de officiële militaire instrumenten zoals hieronder omschreven: 

a. springstoffen die worden vervaardigd of beheerd in beperkte hoeveelheden, uitsluitend voor gebruik in officieel werk ten behoeve van onderzoek naar, ontwikkeling van of het doen van proeven met nieuwe of gewijzigde springstoffen;  

b. springstoffen die worden vervaardigd of beheerd in beperkte hoeveelheden uitsluitend voor gebruik in officiële opleidingen in het opsporen en/of ontwikkelen van springstoffen of het doen van proeven met gereedschap voor het opsporen van springstoffen;  

c. springstoffen die worden vervaardigd of beheerd in beperkte hoeveelheden uitsluitend voor officiële forensische wetenschappelijke doeleinden;  

d. springstoffen die zijn bestemd om een onderdeel te vormen van, en onderdeel zijn van de officiële militaire instrumenten op het grondgebied van de producerende Staat binnen drie jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag ten aanzien van die Staat. Dergelijke instrumenten die binnen dat tijdvak van drie jaar worden geproduceerd, worden beschouwd als officiële militaire instrumenten zoals bedoeld in artikel IV, vierde lid, van dit Verdrag.    

### III  

In dit Deel wordt verstaan onder: 

- "officieel" in paragraaf II, letters a, b en c: toegestaan overeenkomstig de wetten en voorschriften van de betrokken Staat die Partij is; en  

- "brisante stoffen": onder meer, maar niet uitsluitend: cyclotetramethyleentetranitramine (HMX), pentaerythritoltetranitraat (PETN) en cyclotrimethyleentrinitramine (RDX).

####OPSPORINGSMIDDELEN

Een opsporingsmiddel is elk van de in de volgende tabel genoemde stoffen. Het gebruiksdoel van de in deze tabel beschreven opsporingsmiddelen is het vergroten van de mogelijkheid om springstoffen op te sporen door het opsporen van damp. In alle gevallen dient er bij het inbrengen van een opsporingsmiddel in een springstof voor te worden gezorgd dat een homogene verspreiding in het eindprodukt wordt bereikt. Het eindprodukt dient op het tijdstip van vervaardiging de in de tabel gegeven minimumconcentratie van het opsporingsmiddel te bevatten.
