####INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS FOR PREVENTING COLLISIONS AT SEA, 1972

### PART  A  

####GENERAL

### Rule  1  

####Application

a.  These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.   
b.  Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.   
c.  Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.   
d.  Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.   
e.  Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.   

### Rule  2  

####Responsibility

a.  Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.   
b.  In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.   

### Rule  3  

####General Definitions

For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires: 

(a) The word ``vessel" includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  

(b) The term "power-driven vessel" means any vessel propelled by machinery.  

(c) The term "sailing vessel" means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.  

(d) The term "vessel engaged in fishing" means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict manoeuvrability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manoeuvrability.  

(e) The word "seaplane" includes any aircraft designed to manoeuvre on the water.  

(f) The term "vessel not under command" means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.  

(g) The term "vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre" means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. The term "vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre" shall include but not be limited to: 

(i) a vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a navigation mark, submarine cable or pipeline;  

(ii) a vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations;  

(iii) a vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway;  

(iv) a vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft;  

(v) a vessel engaged in mineclearance operations;  

(vi) a vessel engaged in such a towing operation as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to ate from their course.    

(h) The term "vessel constrained by her draught" means a power-driven vessel which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following.  

(i) The term "underway" means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.  

(j) The words "length" and "breadth" of a vessel mean her length overall and greatest breadth.  

(k) Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.  

(l) The term "restricted visibility" means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes.  

(m) The term ``Wing-In-Ground (WIG) craft" means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action.    

### PART  B  

####STEERING AND SAILING RULES

### SECTION  I  

####CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN ANY CONDITION OF VISIBILITY

### Rule  4  

####Application

Rules in this Section apply in any condition of visibility.  

### Rule  5  

####Look-out

Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.  

### Rule  6  

####Safe speed

Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account: 

(a) By all vessels: 

(i) the state of visibility;  

(ii) the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;  

(iii) the manoeuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;  

(iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;  

(v) the state of wind, sea und current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;  

(vi) the draught in relation to the available depth of water.    

(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar: 

(i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;  

(ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;  

(iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference;  

(iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;  

(v) the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar;  

(vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.      

### Rule  7  

####Risk of Collision

a.  Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.   
b.  Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.   
c.  Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information.   
d.  In determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall be among those taken into account: 

(i) such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change;  

(ii) such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range.     

### Rule  8  

####Action to avoid collision

a.  Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the rules of this Part and, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.   
b.  Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.   
c.  If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.   
d.  Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.   
e.  If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.   
f.  

(i) A vessel which, by any of these rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.  

(ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the rules of this part.  

(iii) A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the rules of this part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.     

### Rule  9  

####Narrow channels

a.  A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable.   
b.  A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.   
c.  A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.   
d.  A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.   
e.  

(i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in Rule 34(d).  

(ii) This Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under Rule 13.     
f.  A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34 (e).   
g.  Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.   

### Rule  10  

####Traffic separation schemes

a.  This rule applies to traffic separation schemes adopted by the Organization and does not relieve any vessel of her obligation under any other rule.   
b.  A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall: 

(i) proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane;  

(ii) so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone;  

(iii) normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or leaving from either side shall do so at as small an angle to the general direction of traffic flow as practicable.     
c.  A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.   
d.  

(i) A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when she can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than 20 metres in length, sailing vessels and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.  

(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (d) (i), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when *en route* to or from a port, offshore installation or structure, pilot station or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone, or to avoid immediate danger.     
e.  A vessel other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except: 

(i) in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger;  

(ii) to engage in fishing within a separation zone.     
f.  A vessel navigating in areas near the terminations of traffic separation schemes shall do so with particular caution.   
g.  A vessel shall so far as practicable avoid anchoring in a traffic separation scheme or in areas near its terminations.   
h.  A vessel not using a traffic separation scheme shall avoid it by as wide a margin as is practicable.   
i.  A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane.   
j.  A vessel less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane.   
k.  A vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the maintenance of safety of navigation in a traffic separation scheme is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.   
l.  A vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the laying, servicing or picking up of a submarine cable, within a traffic separation scheme, is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.   

### SECTION  II  

####CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER

### Rule  11  

####Application

Rules in this Section apply to vessels in sight of one another.  

### Rule  12  

####Sailing vessels

a.  When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows: 

(i) when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other;  

(ii) when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward;  

(iii) if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.     
b.  For the purposes of this Rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.   

### Rule  13  

####Overtaking

a.  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I en II any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.   
b.  A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.   
c.  When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.   
d.  Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.   

### Rule  14  

####Head-on-situation

a.  When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.   
b.  Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.   
c.  When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.   

### Rule  15  

####Crossing Situation

When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collosion, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.  

### Rule  16  

####Action by give-way vessel

Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.  

### Rule  17  

####Action by "stand-on" vessel

a.  

(i) Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed.  

(ii) The latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.     
b.  When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giving-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.   
c.  A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) (ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.   
d.  This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.   

### Rule  18  

####Responsibilities between vessels

Except where Rules 9, 10 and 13 otherwise require: 

(a) A power-driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of: 

(i) a vessel not under command;  

(ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;  

(ii) a vessel engaged in fishing;  

(iii) a sailing vessel.    

(b) A sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of: 

(i) a vessel not under command;  

(ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;  

(iii) a vessel engaged in fishing.    

(c) A vessel engaged in fishing underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of: 

(i) a vessel not under command;  

(ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.    

(d) 

(i) Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draught, exhibiting the signals in Rule 28.  

(ii) A vessel constrained by her draught shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition.    

(e) A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with the Rules of this Part.  

(f) 

(i) A WIG craft when taking-off, landing and in flight near the surface shall keep well clear of all other vessels and avoid impeding their navigation;  

(ii) a WIG craft operating on the water surface shall comply with the Rules of this Part as a power-driven vessel.      

### SECTION  III  

####CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN RESTRICTED VISIBILITY

### Rule  19  

####Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility

a.  This Rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.   
b.  Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre.   
c.  Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with Rules of Section I of this Part.   
d.  A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and/or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided: 

(i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken;  

(ii) an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.     
e.  Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.   

### PART  C  

####LIGHTS AND SHAPES

### Rule  20  

####Application

a.  Rules in this Part shall be complied with in all weathers.   
b.

####Intensity of lights

a.  The minimum luminous intensity of lights shall be calculated by using the formula: I = 3.43 x 10 <sup>6</sup> x T x D <sup>2</sup> x K- <sup>D</sup> where I is luminous intensity in candelas under service conditions, T is threshold factor 2 x 10- <sup>7</sup> lux, D is range of visibility (luminous range) of the light in nautical miles, K is atmospheric transmissivity. For prescribed lights the value of K shall be 0.8, corresponding to a meteorological visibility of approximately 13 nautical miles.   
b.  A selection of figures derived from the formula is given in the following table:  

|
|
| Range of visibility (luminous range) of light in nautical miles  D  | Luminous intensity of light in candelas for K = 0.8  I  |
| 1  2  3  4  5  6  | 0.9  4.3  12  27  52  94  |

Note: The maximum luminous intensity of navigation lights should be limited to avoid undue glare. This shall not be achieved by a variable control of the luminous intensity   

### 9  

####Horizontal Sectors

a.  

(i) In the forward direction, sidelights as fitted on the vessel shall show the minimum required intensities. The intensities shall decrease to reach practical cut-off between 1 degree and 3 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.  

(ii) For sternlights and masthead lights and at 22.5 degrees abaft the beam for sidelights, the minimum required intensities shall be maintained over the arc of the horizon up to 5 degrees within the limits of the sectors prescribed in Rule 21. From 5 degrees within the prescribed sectors the intensity may decrease by 50 per cent up to the prescribed sectors; it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut-off at not more than 5 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.     
b.  

(i) All-round lights shall be so located as not to be obscured by masts, topmasts or structures within angular sectors of more than 6 degrees, except anchor lights prescribed in Rule 30, which need not be placed at an impracticable height above the hull.  

(ii) If it is impracticable to comply with paragraph (b)(i) of this section by exhibiting only one all-round light, two all-round lights shall be used suitably positioned or screened so that they appear, as far as practicable, as one light at a distance of one mile.     

### 10  

####Vertical Sectors

a.  The vertical sectors of electric lights as fitted, with the exception of lights on sailing vessels underway shall ensure that: 

(i) at least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;  

(ii) at least 60 per cent of the required minimum intensity is maintained from 7.5 degrees above to 7.5 degrees below the horizontal.     
b.  In the case of sailing vessels underway the vertical sectors of electric lights as fitted shall ensure that: 

(i) at least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;  

(ii) at least 50 per cent of the required minimum intensity is maintained from 25 degrees above to 25 degrees below the horizontal.     
c.  In the case of lights other than electric these specifications shall be met as closely as possible.   

### 11  

####Intensity of non-electric lights

Non-electric lights shall so far as practicable comply with the minimum intensities, as specified in the Table given in Section 8 of this Annex.  

### 12  

####Manoeuvring light

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2(f) of this Annex the manoeuvring light described in Rule 34 (b) shall be placed in the same fore and aft vertical plane as the masthead light or lights and, where practicable, at a minimum height of 2 metres vertically above the forward masthead light, provided that it shall be carried not less than 2 metres vertically above or below the after masthead light. On a vessel where only one masthead light is carried the manoeuvring light, if fitted, shall be carried where it can best be seen, not less than 2 metres vertically apart from the masthead light.  

### 13  

####High speed craft

<sup> 1)  Refer to the International Code of Safety for High-Speed craft, 1994 and the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft, 2000.  </sup>   
a).  The masthead light of high-speed craft may be placed at a height related to the breadth of the craft lower than that prescribed in paragraph 2a)(i) of this annex, provided that the base angle of the isosceles triangles formed by the sidelights and masthead light, when seen in end elevation, is not less than 27°.   
b).  On high-speed craft of 50 metres or more in length, the vertical separation between foremast and mainmast light of 4.5 metres required by paragraph 2a)(ii) of this annex may be modified provided that such distance shall not be less than the value determined by the following formula: y = (a + 17ψ)C/1000 + 2 where: 

y is the height of the mainmast light above the fore mast light in metres;  

a is the height of the foremast light above the water surface in service condition in metres;

### ANNEX  III  

####TECHNICAL DETAILS OF SOUND SIGNAL APPLIANCES

### 1  

####Whistles

a.   *Frequencies and range of audibility*  The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70–700Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180–700Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180–2100Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph 1c) below.   
b.   *Limits of fundamental frequencies*  To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits: 

(i) 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 metres or more in length;  

(ii) 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 metres but less than 200 metres in length;  

(iii) 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 metres in length.     
c.   *Sound signal intensity and range of audibility*  A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 metre from it, a sound pressure level in at least one 1/3rd-octave band within the range of frequencies 180–700Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180–2100Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in the table below.  

| Length of vessel in metres  | 1/3rd-octave band level at 1 metre in dB referred to 2x10 <sup>-5</sup> N/m <sup>2</sup>  | Audibility range in nautical miles  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 200 or more  | 143  | 2  |
| 75 but less than 200  | 138  | 1.5  |
| 20 but less than 75  | 130  | 1  |
| Less than 20  | 120  <sup> *1   When the measured frequencies lie within the range 180–450Hz    </sup> | 0.5  |
| 115  <sup> *2   When the measured frequencies lie within the range 450–800Hz    </sup> |
| 111  <sup> *3   When the measure frequencies lie within the range 800–2100Hz    </sup> |

d.   *Directional properties*  The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis at any direction in the horizontal plane within ± 45 degrees of the axis. The sound pressure level at any other direction in the horizontal plane shall be not more than 10 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis, so that the range in any direction will be at least half the range on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured in that 1/3rd-octave band which determines the audibility range.   
e.   *Positioning of whistles*  When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on a vessel, it shall be installed with its maximum intensity directed straight ahead. A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of the vessels's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB (A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB (A).   
f.   *Fitting of more than one whistle*  If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 metres, it shall be so arranged that they are not sounded simultaneously.   
g.   *Combined whistle systems*  If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in paragraph 1 (f) above is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, it is recommended that a combined whistle system be fitted so as to overcome this reduction. For the purposes of the Rules a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle. The whistles of a combined system shall be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 metres and arranged to be sounded simultaneously. The frequency of any one whistle shall differ from those of the others by at least 10 Hz.   

### 2  

####Bell or gong

a.   *Intensity of signal*  A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at a distance of 1 metre from it.   
b.   *Construction*  Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and designed to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the bell shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of 20 metres or more in length. Where practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to ensure constant force but manual operation shall be possible. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3 percent of the mass of the bell.   

### 3  

####Approval

The construction of sound signal appliances, their performance and their installation on board the vessel shall be to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority of the State whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly.

####- VOORSCHRIFTEN BETREFFENDE HET UITWIJKEN

### AFDELING  I  

####- GEDRAG VAN SCHEPEN BIJ ELK SOORT ZICHT

### Voorschrift  4  

####Toepassing

De voorschriften in deze Afdeling zijn van toepassing bij elk soort zicht.  

### Voorschrift  5  

####Uitkijk

Elk schip dient te allen tijde goede uitkijk te houden door te kijken en te luisteren alsook door gebruik te maken van alle beschikbare middelen die in de heersende omstandigheden en toestanden passend zijn ten einde een volledige beoordeling van de situatie en van het gevaar voor aanvaring te kunnen maken.  

### Voorschrift  6  

####Veilige vaart

Elk schip dient te allen tijde een veilige vaart aan te houden zodat het juiste en doeltreffende maatregelen kan nemen ter vermijding van aanvaring en kan worden gestopt binnen een voor de heersende omstandigheden en toestanden passende afstand. Bij de bepaling van een veilige vaart dient onder meer rekening te worden gehouden met de volgende factoren: 

(a) door alle schepen: 

(i) het zicht;  

(ii) de verkeersdichtheid, met inbegrip van concentraties van vissersschepen of andere schepen;  

(iii) de manoeuvreerbaarheid van het schip, in het bijzonder wat betreft de afstand waarbinnen gestopt kan worden en de wendbaarheid in verband met de heersende toestanden;  

(iv) des nachts de aanwezigheid van achtergrondlicht zoals van kustlichten of het stralen van zijn eigen lichten;

### Voorschrift  7  

####Gevaar voor aanvaring

a.  Elk schip dient alle beschikbare middelen te gebruiken, passend in de heersende omstandigheden en toestanden, om te bepalen of er gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat. In geval van twijfel wordt een zodanig gevaar geacht te bestaan.   
b.  Er dient een juist gebruik te worden gemaakt van radarapparatuur, indien aangebracht en goed werkend, met inbegrip van waarnemingen over grote afstand ten einde een vroegtijdige waarschuwing te verkrijgen van het gevaar voor aanvaring en met inbegrip van plotten of een gelijkwaardige stelselmatige waarneming van ontdekte voorwerpen.   
c.  Er dienen geen gevolgtrekkingen te worden gemaakt op grond van summiere gegevens, vooral niet van summiere gegevens verkregen met behulp van radar.   
d.  Bij de bepaling of er gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat, dient onder meer rekening te worden gehouden met de volgende overwegingen: 

(i) een zodanig gevaar wordt geacht te bestaan indien de kompaspeiling van een naderend schip niet noemenswaard verandert;  

(ii) zelfs wanneer een aanmerkelijke verandering in de peiling blijkt, kan een zodanig gevaar soms bestaan, vooral bij het naderen van een zeer groot schip of een sleep of bij het dicht naderen van een schip.     

### Voorschrift  8  

####Maatregelen ter vermijding van aanvaring

a.  Alle maatregelen ter vermijding van aanvaringen moeten worden genomen in overeenstemming met de voorschriften van dit Deel, en dienen, indien de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, doelmatig te zijn en ruim op tijd te worden genomen, daarbij goed rekening houdend met de gebruiken van goed zeemanschap.   
b.  Elke verandering van koers en/of vaart ter vermijding van aanvaring dient, indien de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, groot genoeg te zijn om gemakkelijk waarneembaar te zijn voor een ander schip waarop met het oog of met behulp van radar wordt waargenomen; een opeenvolging van kleine veranderingen van koers en/of vaart dient te worden vermeden.   
c.  Indien daarvoor voldoende ruimte is, kan een koersverandering alléén de meest doeltreffende maatregel zijn om te vermijden dat men elkaar te dicht nadert, mits de maatregel bijtijds wordt genomen, de koersverandering ruim is en niet leidt tot een andere situatie waarin men elkaar te dicht nadert.   
d.  De maatregelen genomen ter vermijding van aanvaring met een ander schip dienen zodanig te zijn dat zij leiden tot het voorbijvaren op veilige afstand. De doeltreffendheid van de maatregelen dient zorgvuldig te worden gecontroleerd totdat het andere schip geheel is gepasseerd en goed vrij is.   
e.  Indien zulks noodzakelijk is ter vermijding van aanvaring of om meer tijd te verkrijgen ter beoordeling van de situatie dient een schip vaart te minderen of de vaart er geheel uit te halen door te stoppen of achteruit te slaan.   
f.  

(i) Een schip dat op grond van een van deze voorschriften de doorvaart of de veilige doorvaart van een ander schip niet mag belemmeren dient, wanneer de omstandigheden zulks vereisen, bijtijds maatregelen te nemen om voldoende ruimte te laten voor de veilige doorvaart van het andere schip.  

(ii) Een schip dat de doorvaart of de veilige doorvaart van een ander schip niet mag belemmeren is niet ontheven van deze verplichting als het het andere schip nadert zodanig dat gevaar voor aanvaring ontstaat en dient, wanneer het maatregelen neemt, ten volle rekening te houden met de maatregelen die volgens de voorschriften van dit Deel vereist kunnen zijn.  

(iii) Een schip waarvan de doorvaart niet mag worden belemmerd blijft ten volle verplicht de voorschriften van dit Deel na te leven wanneer de twee schepen elkaar naderen zodanig dat gevaar voor aanvaring ontstaat.     

### Voorschrift  9  

####Nauwe vaarwateren

a.  Een schip dat de richting van een nauw vaarwater of vaargeul volgt, dient de buitenzijde van het vaarwater of de vaargeul aan zijn stuurboordszijde te houden, zo dicht als veilig en uitvoerbaar is.   
b.  Een schip met een lengte van minder dan 20 meter of een zeilschip mag de doorvaart van een schip dat slechts in het nauwe vaarwater of de vaargeul veilig kan varen niet belemmeren.   
c.  Een schip bezig met de uitoefening van de visserij mag de doorvaart van een ander schip varend in een nauw vaarwater of vaargeul niet belemmeren.   
d.  Een schip mag een nauw vaarwater of vaargeul niet kruisen indien dit kruisen de doorvaart belemmert van een schip dat slechts in zulk een vaarwater of vaargeul veilig kan varen. Laatstgenoemd schip kan het geluidsein, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 34 (d), gebruiken indien het twijfelt aan de bedoeling van het kruisende schip.   
e.  

(i) Wanneer in een nauw vaarwater of vaargeul het oplopen slechts kan plaatsvinden indien het op te lopen schip maatregelen moet nemen om een veilig voorbij varen mogelijk te maken, dient het schip dat van plan is op te lopen zijn voornemen kenbaar te maken door het passende sein te geven, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 34(c)(i). Het op te lopen schip dient, indien het instemt, het passende sein te geven, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 34(c)(ii), en maatregelen te nemen om een veilig voorbij varen mogelijk te maken. In geval van twijfel kan het de seinen geven, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 34(d).  

(ii) Dit voorschrift ontheft het oplopende schip niet van zijn verplichting volgens voorschrift 13.     
f.  Een schip dat een bocht of een gebied in een nauw vaarwater of vaargeul nadert waar het zicht op andere schepen kan worden belemmerd door een tussenliggend obstakel dient met bijzondere waakzaamheid en voorzichtigheid te varen en het passende sein te geven, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 34(e).   
g.  Indien de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, dient een schip het ankeren in een nauw vaarwater te vermijden.   

### Voorschrift  10  

####Verkeersscheidingsstelsels

a.  Dit voorschrift is van toepassing op door de Organisatie aangenomen verkeersscheidingsstelsels en ontheft schepen niet van hun verplichtingen op grond van enig ander voorschrift.   
b.  Een schip dat gebruik maakt van een verkeersscheidingsstelsel dient: 

(i) in de passende verkeersbaan te varen in de algemene richting van de verkeersstroom voor die baan;  

(ii) voor zover uitvoerbaar vrij te blijven van een scheidingslijn of -zone;  

(iii) in het algemeen een verkeersbaan binnen te varen of te verlaten aan het uiteinde van de baan doch, wanneer de baan aan één van beide zijkanten wordt binnengevaren of verlaten, dient het zulks te doen onder een zo klein mogelijke hoek ten opzichte van de algemene richting van de verkeersstroom als uitvoerbaar is.     
c.  Een schip dient voor zover uitvoerbaar het kruisen van verkeersbanen te vermijden doch, indien het daartoe verplicht is, dient het zulks te doen met een voorliggende koers die zoveel mogelijk een rechte hoek ten opzichte van de algemene richting van de verkeersstroom benadert als uitvoerbaar is.   
d.  

(i) Een schip mag een zone voor kustverkeer niet gebruiken wanneer het zonder gevaar de passende verkeersbaan binnen het aangrenzende verkeersscheidingsstelsel kan gebruiken. Schepen met een lengte van minder dan 20 meter, zeilschepen en schepen bezig met de uitoefening van de visserij mogen de zone voor kustverkeer echter wel gebruiken;  

(ii) Niettegenstaande het bepaalde onder (d) (i) mag een schip een zone voor kustverkeer gebruiken wanneer het onderweg is naar of van een haven, een buiten de kust gelegen installatie of contructie, een loodsstation of een andere plaats gelegen binnen de zone voor kustverkeer, of om onmiddellijk gevaar te vermijden.     
e.  Een schip, geen kruisend schip zijnde, of een schip dat een verkeersbaan binnenvaart of verlaat, mag in het algemeen niet een scheidingszone binnenvaren of een scheidingslijn kruisen behalve: 

(i) in noodgevallen ter vermijding van onmiddellijk gevaar;  

(ii) om de visserij uit te gaan oefenen binnen een scheidingszone.     
f.  Een schip varend in gebieden bij de uiteinden van verkeersscheidingsstelsels dient zulks met bijzondere voorzichtigheid te doen.   
g.  Een schip dient voor zover uitvoerbaar het ankeren in een verkeersscheidingsstelsel of in gebieden vlak bij de uiteinden daarvan te vermijden.   
h.  Een schip dat geen gebruik maakt van een verkeersscheidingsstelsel dient het met een zo ruim mogelijke marge als uitvoerbaar is te mijden.   
i.  Een schip bezig met de uitoefening van de visserij mag de doorvaart van een schip dat een verkeersbaan volgt niet belemmeren.   
j.  Een schip met een lengte van minder dan 20 meter of een zeilschip mag de veilige doorvaart van een werktuiglijk voortbewogen schip dat een verkeersbaan volgt niet belemmeren.   
k.  Een beperkt manoeuvreerbaar schip, bezig met werkzaamheden voor de instandhouding van een veilige navigatie in een verkeersscheidingsstelsel, is vrijgesteld van de naleving van dit Voorschrift, voor zover zulks nodig is om de werkzaamheden uit te voeren.   
l.  Een beperkt manoeuvreerbaar schip, bezig met het leggen van, het plegen van onderhoud aan of het opnemen van een onderzeese kabel, binnen het gebied van een verkeersscheidingsstelsel, is vrijgesteld van de naleving van dit Voorschrift, voor zover zulks nodig is om de werkzaamheden uit te voeren.   

### AFDELING  II  

####- GEDRAG VAN SCHEPEN DIE IN ZICHT VAN ELKAAR ZIJN

### Voorschrift  11  

####Toepassing

De voorschriften in deze Afdeling zijn van toepassing op schepen die in zicht van elkaar zijn.  

### Voorschrift  12  

####Zeilschepen

a.  Wanneer twee zeilschepen elkaar naderen, zodanig dat gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat, dient één van beide uit te wijken en wel als volgt: 

(i) indien beide schepen over verschillende boeg liggen,dient het schip dat over stuurboordsboeg ligt uit te wijken voor het schip dat over bakboordsboeg ligt;  

(ii) indien beide schepen over dezelfde boeg liggen, dient het loefwaartse schip uit te wijken voor het lijwaartse;  

(iii) indien een schip dat over stuurboordsboeg ligt aan zijn loefzijde een schip ziet en niet met zekerheid kan bepalen of dat schip over stuurboords- dan wel over bakboordsboeg ligt, dient het daarvoor uit te wijken.     
b.  In dit voorschrift dient onder loefzijde te worden verstaan de andere zijde dan die waarover het grootzeil wordt gevoerd of, in geval van een vierkant getuigd schip, de andere zijde dan die, waarover het grootste langsscheepse zeil bijstaat.   

### Voorschrift  13  

####Oplopen

a.  Onafhankelijk van hetgeen in de Voorschriften van Deel B, Afdeling I en II is voorgeschreven, dient elk schip, dat een ander schip oploopt, uit te wijken voor het schip dat opgelopen wordt.   
b.  Een schip wordt geacht op te lopen wanneer het een ander schip nadert uit een richting van meer dan 22,5 graden achterlijker dan dwars, dat wil zeggen in een zodanige positie met betrekking tot het schip dat opgelopen wordt, dat het des nachts alleen het heklicht van dat schip doch geen van zijn boordlichten zou kunnen zien.   
c.  Wanneer een schip in twijfel verkeert of het een ander schip oploopt, dient het aan te nemen dat zulks het geval is en dienovereenkomstig te handelen.   
d.  Elke volgende verandering van de peiling tussen de twee schepen kan het oplopende schip niet maken tot een koerskruisend schip in de zin van deze Voorschriften of het ontslaan van de plicht om vrij te blijven van het opgelopen schip totdat het geheel is gepasseerd en goed vrij is.   

### Voorschrift  14  

####Recht tegen elkaar in sturen

a.  Wanneer twee werktuiglijk voortbewogen schepen op tegengestelde of bijna tegengestelde koersen tegen elkaar in sturen, zodanig dat zulks gevaar voor aanvaring medebrengt, dienen beide naar stuurboord van koers te veranderen, zodat zij elkaar aan bakboordszijde voorbijvaren.   
b.  Een zodanige situatie wordt geacht te bestaan wanneer een schip het andere recht of bijna recht vooruit ziet en des nachts de toplichten van het andere schip in één lijn of nagenoeg in één lijn en/of de beide boordlichten zou kunnen zien en overdag het dienovereenkomstige beeld van het andere schip waarneemt.   
c.  Wanneer een schip in twijfel verkeert of een zodanige situatie bestaat, dient het aan te nemen dat zulks het geval is en dienovereenkomstig te handelen.   

### Voorschrift  15  

####Koers kruisen

Wanneer de koersen van twee werktuiglijk voortbewogen schepen elkaar kruisen, zodanig dat zulks gevaar voor aanvaring medebrengt, dient het schip dat het andere aan stuurboordszijde van zich heeft, uit te wijken en, wanneer de omstandigheden het toelaten, te vermijden vóór het andere over te lopen.  

### Voorschrift  16  

####Maatregelen van het schip dat moet uitwijken

Elk schip dat verplicht is uit te wijken voor een ander schip dient, voor zover dit mogelijk is, bijtijds ruim voldoende maatregelen te nemen om goed vrij te blijven.  

### Voorschrift  17  

####Maatregelen van het schip dat koers en vaart moet houden

a.  

(i) Wanneer één van beide schepen verplicht is uit te wijken, dient het andere zijn koers en vaart te behouden,  

(ii) Het laatstgenoemde schip mag echter maatregelen nemen ter vermijding van aanvaring door zelf een manoeuvre uit te voeren zodra hem duidelijk wordt dat het schip dat verplicht is uit te wijken niet de passende maatregelen neemt die ingevolge deze Voorschriften zijn voorgeschreven.     
b.  Indien tengevolge van enige oorzaak het schip dat verplicht is zijn koers en vaart te behouden zich zo dicht bij het andere bevindt, dat aanvaring door een handeling van het schip dat moet uitwijken alléén niet kan worden vermeden, dient het de maatregelen te nemen, die het best kunnen bijdragen tot het vermijden van aanvaring.   
c.  Een werktuiglijk voortbewogen schip dat maatregelen neemt overeenkomstig het bepaalde onder (a) (ii) van dit voorschrift ten einde aanvaring te vermijden met een ander werktuiglijk voortbewogen schip dat zijn koers kruist, dient, wanneer de omstandigheden het toelaten, geen koers naar bakboord te wijzigen wanneer dat schip zich aan zijn eigen bakboordszijde bevindt.   
d.  Dit voorschrift ontheft het schip dat verplicht is uit te wijken niet van die verplichting.   

### Voorschrift  18  

####Verantwoordelijkheden van schepen onderling

Behalve waar de voorschriften 9, 10 en 13 anders voorschrijven:

(ii) een beperkt manoeuvreerbaar schip;    

(d) 

(i) dient elk schip, niet zijnde een onmanoeuvreerbaar schip of een beperkt manoeuvreerbaar schip, indien de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, te vermijden de veilige vaart te belemmeren van een schip door zijn diepgang beperkt in zijn manoeuvreerbaarheid, dat de seinen van voorschrift 28 toont;  

(ii) dient een schip door zijn diepgang beperkt in zijn manoeuvreerbaarheid met bijzondere omzichtigheid te varen, ten volle rekening houdend met zijn bijzondere toestand;    

(e) dient een zich op het water bevindend watervliegtuig in het algemeen ruim vrij te blijven van alle schepen en te vermijden hun vaart te belemmeren. In omstandigheden evenwel waarin er gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat, dient het te handelen overeenkomstig de voorschriften van dit Deel.  

(f) 

i. dient een WIG-tuig tijdens het starten, de landing en de vlucht vlak bij de wateroppervlakte ruim vrij te blijven van alle andere schepen en te vermijden hun vaart te belemmeren;

####Gedrag van schepen bij beperkt zicht

a.  Dit voorschrift is van toepassing op schepen die niet in zicht van elkaar zijn wanneer zij varen in of in de buurt van een gebied met beperkt zicht.   
b.  Elk schip dient een veilige vaaart aan te houden, aangepast aan de heersende omstandigheden en de toestanden van beperkt zicht. Een werktuiglijk voortbewogen schip dient zijn machines gereed te hebben ten einde onmiddellijk te kunnen manoeuvreren.   
c.  Elk schip dient bij de naleving van de voorschriften van Afdeling I van dit Deel goed rekening te houden met de heersende omstandigheden en de toestanden van beperkt zicht.   
d.  Een schip dat alleen met behulp van radar de aanwezigheid van een ander schip ontdekt, dient vast te stellen of zich een situatie ontwikkelt waarin men elkaar te dicht nadert en/of gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat. Is dit het geval, dan dient het bijtijds maatregelen ter vermijding daarvan te nemen, met dien verstande dat wanneer zulke maatregelen bestaan uit een koersverandering, voor zover mogelijk dient te worden vermeden: 

(i) een koersverandering naar bakboord voor een schip voorlijker dan dwars, dat niet is een schip dat wordt opgelopen;  

(ii) een koersverandering in de richting van een schip dwars of achterlijker dan dwars.     
e.  Behalve wanneer is vastgesteld dat er geen gevaar voor aanvaring bestaat, dient elk schip dat schijnbaar voorlijker dan dwars het mistsein van een ander schip hoort of dat een te dicht naderen van een schip voorlijker dan dwars niet kan vermijden, zijn vaart te verminderen tot het minimum waarbij het op koers kan worden gehouden. Indien nodig dient de vaart geheel uit het schip te worden gehaald en in elk geval uiterst voorzichtig te worden gemanoeuvreerd totdat het gevaar voor aanvaring is geweken.

### 8  

####Lichtsterkte

(a).  De minste lichtsterkte van de lichten dient te worden berekend aan de hand van de formule: I = 3,43 X 10 <sup>6</sup> X T X D <sup>2</sup> X K- <sup>D</sup> waarin voorstelt: I: de bedrijfslichtsterkte in candela's; T: 2 X 10- <sup>7</sup>, zijnde de verlichtingsdrempelwaarde van het oog in lux; D: de zichtbaarheid van het licht in zeemijlen; K: de factor voor atmosferische doorlating. Voor voorgeschreven lichten wordt de waarde van K gesteld op 0,8, overeenkomend met een meteorologisch zicht van ongeveer 13 zeemijlen.   
(b).  Een keuze uit de aan de hand van de formule berekende cijfers wordt gegeven in de onderstaande tabel:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Zichtbaarheid van het licht in zeemijlen  | Lichtsterkte van het licht in candela's bij K = 0,8  |
| D  | I  |
| 1  2  3  4  5  6  | 0,9  4,3  12  27  52  94  |

Noot: De maximum lichtsterkte van navigatielichten dient te worden beperkt ter vermijding van hinderlijke verblinding. Hiervoor mag geen gebruik worden gemaakt van een variabele lichtsterkte regelaar.   

### 9  

####Horizontale sectoren

a.  

(i) Boordlichten zoals aangebracht op het schip dienen in de richting recht vooruit de vereiste minste lichtsterkte te hebben. De lichtsterkte moet zodanig afnemen, dat tussen 1 en 3 graden buiten de voorgeschreven voorste sectorgrenzen vrijwel geen licht meer waarneembaar is.  

(ii) Voor heklichten en toplichten en voor boordlichten bij 22,5 graden achterlijker dan dwars dienen de vereiste minste lichtsterkten te worden gehandhaafd over de boog van de horizon tot 5 graden binnen de in voorschrift 21 voorgeschreven sectorgrenzen. Vanaf 5 graden binnen deze voorgeschreven sectorgrenzen mag de lichtsterkte afnemen met 50 percent tot aan de voorgeschreven sectorgrenzen; zij dient daarna geleidelijk af te nemen en wel zodanig, dat bij niet meer dan 5 graden buiten de sectorgrenzen bij 22,5 graden achterlijker dan dwars vrijwel geen licht meer waarneembaar is.     
b.  

(i) Rondom zichtbare lichten dienen zo te worden aangebracht dat zij niet door masten, stengen of scheepsdelen over een boog van meer dan 6 graden worden afgeschermd; lichten, voorgeschreven in voorschrift 30 voor ten anker liggende schepen, behoeven evenwel niet op een onredelijke hoogte boven de romp te zijn aangebracht.  

(ii) Indien het niet uitvoerbaar is aan letter b) i) van dit punt te voldoen door slechts een rondom zichtbaar licht te tonen, dienen twee rondom zichtbare lichten te worden gebruikt, die op passende wijze zijn geplaatst of afgeschermd zodat zij, voor zover uitvoerbaar, op een afstand van een mijl als één licht toeschijnen.     

### 10  

####Verticale sectoren

a.  De verticale sectoren van geplaatste elektrische lichten, met uitzondering van de lichten op zeilschepen die varende zijn, dienen zodanig te zijn dat: 

(i) in ieder geval de vereiste minste lichtsterkte wordt gehandhaafd in de gehele sector van 5 graden boven tot 5 graden onder het horizontale vlak;  

(ii) in ieder geval 60 percent van de vereiste minste lichtsterkte wordt gehandhaafd van 7,5 graden boven en tot 7,5 graden onder het horizontale vlak.     
b.  De verticale sectoren van geplaatste elektrische lichten op zeilschepen die varende zijn dienen zodanig te zijn dat:

(ii) in ieder geval 50 percent van de vereiste minste lichtsterkte wordt gehandhaafd van 25 graden boven tot 25 graden onder het horizontale vlak.     
c.  Bij niet-elektrische lichten dient zo goed mogelijk aan deze eisen te worden voldaan.   

### 11  

####Lichtsterkte van niet-elektrische lichten

Niet-elektrische lichten dienen voorzover uitvoerbaar te voldoen aan de eisen van minste lichtsterkte zoals aangegeven in de tabel onder punt 8 van deze Bijlage.

### BIJLAGE  III  

####TECHNISCHE BIJZONDERHEDEN VAN TOESTELLEN VOOR GELUIDSEINEN

### 1  

####Fluiten

a.   *Frequenties en hoorbaarheidsafstand*  De grondfrequentie van het sein dient te liggen tussen 70 en 700 Hz. De hoorbaarheidsafstand van het sein van een f.uit wordt bepaald door die frequenties, die de grondfrequentie en/of één of meer hogere frequenties kunnen omvatten, die tussen 180 en 700 Hz (+/- 1%) liggen voor een schip met een lengte van 20 meter of meer, of die tussen 180 en 2100 Hz (+/- 1%) liggen voor een schip met een lengte van minder dan 20 meter en die de geluidsdrukniveaus voortbrengen, aangegeven in paragraaf 1(c) hieronder.   
b.   *Grenzen van grondfrequenties*  Om een ruime verscheidenheid in kenmerken van fluiten te waarborgen dient de grondfrequentie van een fluit tussen de volgende grenzen te liggen: 

(i) 70-200 Hz voor een schip met een lengte van 200 meter of meer;  

(ii) 130-350 Hz voor een schip met een lengte van 75 meter of meer doch minder dan 200 meter;  

(iii) 250-700 Hz voor een schip met een lengte van minder dan 75 meter.     
c.   *Geluidssterkte en hoorbaarheidsafstand*  Een op een schip aangebrachte fluit dient in de richting van de grootste geluidssterkte van de f.uit en op een afstand van 1 meter daarvan in ten minste één 1/3 octaafband binnen de frequenties tussen 180 en 700 Hz (+/- 1%) voor een schip met een lengte van 20 meter of meer, of tussen 180 en 2100 Hz voor een schip met een lengte van minder dan 20meter, een geluidsdrukniveau voort te brengen van niet minder dan het desbetreffende cijfer in de onderstaande tabel.  

| Lengte van het schip in meters  | 1/3 octaafbandniveau op 1 meter in dB ten opzichte van 2x10- <sup>5</sup> N/m2  | Hoorbaarheidsafstand In zeemijlen  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 200 of meer  | 143  | 2  |
| 75 of meer doch minder dan 200  | 138  | 1.5  |
| 20 of meer doch minder dan 75  | 130  | 1  |
| Minder dan 20  | 120  <sup> *1   Wanneer de gemeten frequenties liggen tussen 180 en 450 HZ    </sup> | 0.5  |
| 115  <sup> *2   Wanneer de gemeten frequenties liggen tussen 450 en 800 Hz    </sup> |
| 111  <sup> *3   Wanneer de gemeten frequenties liggen tussen 800 en 2100 Hz    </sup> |

d.   *Richtingseigenschappen*  Het geluidsdrukniveau van een gerichte fluit mag in elke richting in het horizontale vlak binnen ± 45 graden van de as niet meer dan 4 dB onder het voorgeschreven geluidsdrukniveau op de as zijn. Het geluidsdrukniveau in elke andere richting in het horizontale vlak mag niet meer dan 10 dB onder het voorgeschreven geluidsdrukniveau op de as zijn, zodat de reikwijdte in elke richting ten minste de helft van de reikwijdte op de as recht vooruit zal zijn. Het geluidsdrukniveau dient te worden gemeten in die octaafband die bepalend is voor de hoorbaarheidsafstand.   
e.   *Plaatsing van de fluiten*  Wanneer een gerichte fluit als de enige fluit op een schip wordt gebruikt, dient hij zo te zijn aangebracht dat zijn grootste geluidssterkte recht naar voren is gericht. Een fluit dient zo hoog op een schip te zijn geplaatst als uitvoerbaar is, ten einde het onderscheppen van het voortgebrachte geluid door obstakels te verminderen en ook om het gevaar voor beschadiging van het menselijk gehoororgaan tot een minimum te beperken. Het geluidsdrukniveau van het eigen sein van het schip op luisterposten mag niet hoger zijn dan 110 dB (A) en voor zover uitvoerbaar niet hoger dan 100 dB (A).   
f.   *Het aanbrengen van meer dan één fluit*  Indien op een schip fluiten zijn aangebracht op een onderlinge afstand van meer dan 100 meter, dienen er maatregelen te worden getroffen, opdat zij niet gelijktijdig worden gebruikt.   
g.   *Gecombineerde fluitsystemen*  Indien wegens de aanwezigheid van obstakels het geluidsveld van een enkele fluit of van één van de fluiten bedoeld onder (f) waarschijnlijk een gebied zal hebben met een aanzienlijk verminderd geluidsniveau, wordt aanbevolen dat een gecombineerd fluitsysteem wordt aangebracht, ten einde deze vermindering op te heffen. Voor de toepassing van de Voorschriften dient een gecombineerd fluitsysteem als een enkele fluit te worden beschouwd. De fluiten van een gecombineerd systeem dienen te zijn geplaatst op een onderlinge afstand van niet meer dan 100 meter en zo te zijn ingericht dat zij tegelijkertijd worden gebruikt. De frequentie van elk van de afzonderlijke fluiten dient ten minste 10 Hz te verschillen van die van de andere.   

### 2  

####Klok of gong

a.   *Geluidssterkte van het sein*  Een klok of gong of ander toestel met soortgelijke geluidskenmerken dient een geluidsdrukniveau voort te brengen van niet minder dan 110 dB op een afstand van 1 meter.   
b.   *Constructie*  Klokken en gongs dienen te zijn vervaardigd uit corrosiebestendig materiaal en zo te zijn ontworpen dat ze een heldere toon voortbrengen. De middellijn van een klok mag niet minder zijn dan 300 mm voor schepen met een lengte van 20 meter of meer. Indien dit uitvoerbaar is wordt een werktuigelijk aangedreven klepel aanbevolen teneinde een constante kracht te waarborgen, doch bediening met de hand dient mogelijk te zijn. De massa van de klepel dient ten minste 3 percent van de massa van de klok te zijn.   

### 3  

####Goedkeuring

De constructie van toestellen voor geluidseinen, hun werking en de plaatsing aan boord van het schip dienen ten genoege te zijn van de bevoegde autoriteit van de vlaggestaat.
