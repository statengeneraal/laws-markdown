##Overeenkomst inzake de erkenning van studies aan, en diploma's of graden van instellingen van hoger onderwijs in de Staten, behorende tot de Europese Regio

####Convention on the recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees concerning higher education in the States belonging to the Europe Region

Preamble The States of the Europe Region, Parties to this Convention, Recalling that, as the General Conference of Unesco has noted on several occasions in its resolutions concerning European co-operation, “the development of co-operation between nations in the fields of education, science, culture and communication, in accordance with the principles set out in Unesco's Constitution, plays an essential role in the promotion of peace and international understanding”, Conscious of the close relationship that exists between their cultures, despite their diversity of languages and the differences in economic and social systems, and desiring to strengthen their co-operation in the field of education and training in the interests of the well-being and lasting prosperity of their peoples, Recalling that the States meeting in Helsinki expressed, in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (1 August 1975), their intention “to improve access, under mutually acceptable conditions, for students, teachers and scholars of the participating States to each other's educational, cultural and scientific institutions... in particular by... arriving at the mutual recognition of academic degrees and diplomas either through governmental agreements, where necessary, or direct arrangements between universities and other institutions of higher learning and research”, and also by “promoting a more exact assessment of the problems of comparison and equivalence of academic degrees and diplomas”, Recalling that, with a view to promoting the attainment of these objectives, most of the Contracting States have already concluded bilateral or subregional agreements among themselves concerning the equivalence or recognition of diplomas; but desiring, while pursuing and intensifying their efforts at the bilateral and subregional levels, to extend their co-operation in this field to the whole Europe Region, Convinced that the great diversity of higher education systems in the Europe Region constitutes an exceptionally rich cultural asset which should be preserved, and desiring to enable all their peoples to benefit fully from this rich cultural asset by facilitating access by the inhabitants of each Contracting State to the educational resources of the other Contracting States, more especially by authorizing them to continue their education in higher educational institutions in those other States, Considering that, to authorize admission to further stages of study, the concept of the recognition of studies should be employed, a concept which, in a context of social and international mobility, makes it possible to evaluate the level of education reached bearing in mind knowledge acquired, as attested by diplomas and degrees obtained and also the individual's other relevant qualifications, so far as these may be deemed acceptable by competent authorities, Considering that the recognition by ail the Contracting States of studies, certificates, diplomas and degrees obtained in any one of them is intended to develop the international mobility of persons and the exchange of ideas, knowledge and scientific and technological experience, and that it would be desirable to accept foreign students into establishments of higher education on the understanding that recognition of their studies or diplomas shall at no time confer on them greater rights than those enjoyed by national students, Noting that this recognition constitutes one of the conditions necessary for: 

1. Enabling means of education existing in their territories to be used as effectively as possible,  

2. Ensuring that teachers, students, research workers and professional workers have greater mobility,  

3. Alleviating the difficulties encountered on their return by persons who have been trained or educated abroad,   Desiring to ensure that studies, certificates, diplomas and degrees are recognized as widely as possible, taking into account the principles of the promotion of lifelong education, the democratization of education, and the adoption and application of an education policy allowing for structural, economic, technological en social changes and suited to the cultural context of each country, Determined to sanction and organize their future collaboration in these matters by means of a convention which will be the starting point for concerted dynamic action taken in particular by means of national, bilateral, subregional and multilateral machinery already existing or that may be deemed necessary, Mindful that the ultimate objective set by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization consists in “preparing an International Convention on the Recognition and the Validity of Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates issued by establishments of Higher Learning and Research in all Countries”,   Have agreed as follows:    

### I  

####DEFINITIONS

### Article  1  

1.  For the purpose of this Convention, the “recognition” of a foreign certificate, diploma or degree of higher education means its acceptance as a valid credential by the competent authorities in a Contracting State and the granting to its holder of rights enjoyed by persons who possess a national certificate, diploma or degree with which the foreign one is assessed as comparable. Recognition is further defined as follows: 

(a) Recognition of a certificate, diploma or degree with a view to undertaking or pursuing studies at the higher level shall enable the holder to be considered for entry to the higher educational and research institutions of any Contracting State as if he were the holder of a comparable certificate, diploma or degree issued in the Contracting State concerned. Such recognition does not exempt the holder of the foreign certificate, diploma or degree from complying with the conditions (other than those relating to the holding of a diploma) which may be required for admission to the higher educational or research institution concerned of the receiving State.  

(b) Recognition of a foreign certificate, diploma or degree with a view to the practice of a profession is recognition of the professional preparation of the holder for the practice of the profession concerned, without prejudice, however, to the legal and professional rules or procedures in force in the Contracting States concerned. Such recognition does not exempt the holder of the foreign certificate, diploma or degree from complying with any other conditions for the practice of the profession concerned which may be laid down by the competent governmental or professional authorities.  

(c) Recognition of a certificate, diploma or degree should not, however, entitle the holder to more rights in another Contracting State than he would enjoy in the country in which the certificate, diploma or degree was awarded.     
2.  For the purposes of this Convention, “partial studies” means periods of study or training which while not constituting a complete course are such that they add significantly to the acquisition of knowledge or skills.   

### II  

####AIMS

### Article  2  

1.  The Contracting States intend to contribute through their joint action both to the promotion of the active co-operation of all the countries of the Europe Region in the cause of peace and international understanding, and to the development of more effective collaboration with other Member States of Unesco with regard to a better use of their educational, technological and scientific potential.   
2.  The Contracting States solemnly declare their firm resolve to co-operate closely within the framework of their legislation and constitutional structures, as well as within the framework of existing intergovernmental agreements, with a view to: 

(a) Enabling, in the interest of the Contracting States, and consistent with their general policy for educational provision and administrative procedures, the best use of their available education and research resources, and for this purpose:

(vi) to improve the system for the exchange of information regarding the recognition of studies, certificates, diplomas and degrees;    

(b) Constantly improving curricula in the Contracting States and methods of planning and promoting higher education, on the basis of not only the requirements for economic, social and cultural development, the policies of each country and also the objectives that are set out in the recommendations made by the competent organs of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization concerning the continuous improvement of the quality of education, the promotion of lifelong education and the democratization of education, but also the aims of the full development of the human personality and of understanding, tolerance and friendship among nations and in general all aims concerning human rights assigned to education by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations International Covenants on Human Rights and the Unesco Convention Against Discrimination in Education.  

(c) Promoting regional and world-wide co-operation for the solution of the “problems of comparison and equivalence between academic degrees and diplomas”... as well as for recognition of studies and academic diplomas.     
3.

####Overeenkomst inzake de erkenning van studies aan, en diploma's of graden van instellingen van hoger onderwijs in de Staten, behorende tot de Europese Regio

Preambule De Staten, behoren tot de Europese Regio, die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, Herinnerend aan het feit dat, zoals de Algemene Conferentie van de Unesco bij diverse gelegenheden in haar resoluties inzake Europese samenwerking heeft opgemerkt, „de ontwikkeling van samenwerking tussen landen op het gebied van onderwijs, wetenschap, cultuur en communicatie, in overeenstemming met de beginselen, vervat in het Statuut van de Unesco, een essentiële rol speelt bij het bevorderen van vrede en internationaal begrip”, Zich bewust van de nauwe samenhang die, ondanks de verscheidenheid van talen en de verschillen tussen de economische en sociale stelsels, tussen hun culturen bestaat, en verlangend hun samenwerking op het gebied van onderwijs en opleiding in het belang van het welzijn en de blijvende welvaart van hun volken te verstevigen, Herinnerend aan het feit dat de Staten die in Helsinki zijn bijeengekomen, in de Slotakte van de Conferentie over Veiligheid en Samenwerking in Europa (1 augustus 1975) uiting hebben gegeven aan hun voornemen „de toegang, op wederzijds aanvaardbare voorwaarden, voor studenten, docenten en wetenschapsbeoefenaren uit de deelnemende Staten tot eikaars instellingen voor onderwijs, cultuur en wetenschap te verbeteren ... in het bijzonder door ... te komen tot de wederzijdse erkenning van universitaire graden en diploma's, hetzij, waar nodig, door overeenkomsten tussen Regeringen, hetzij door rechtstreekse overeenkomsten tussen universiteiten en andere instellingen van hoger onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek” alsook door „het bevorderen van een nauwkeuriger bepaling van de problemen van vergelijking en gelijkwaardigheid van universitaire graden en diploma's”, Herinnerend aan het feit dat, ten einde de verwezenlijking van deze doeleinden te bevorderen, het merendeel van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten onderling reeds bilaterale of subregionale overeenkomsten inzake de gelijkwaardigheid of de erkenning van diploma's heeft gesloten; verlangend echter, onder voortzetting en vergroting van hun inspanningen op bilateraal en subregionaal niveau, hun samenwerking op dit gebied tot de gehele Europese Regio uit te breiden, Ervan overtuigd dat de grote verscheidenheid van stelsels voor hoger onderwijs in de Europese Regio een buitengewoon groot cultureel goed vormt, dat behouden dient te blijven, en verlangend al hun volken in staat te stellen volledig profijt te trekken van dit grote culturele goed, door voor de inwoners van iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Staat de toegang tot de onderwijsvoorzieningen van de andere Overeenkomstsluitende Staten te vergemakkelijken, meer in het bijzonder door hun toestemming te verlenen hun opleiding aan instellingen voor hoger onderwijs in die andere Staten voort te zetten, Overwegend dat, ten einde toelating tot verdere studies mogelijk te maken, het begrip „erkenning van studies” dient te worden gehanteerd, dat in het kader van sociale en internationale mobiliteit de mogelijkheid biedt het bereikte opleidingsniveau te beoordelen aan de hand van de verworven kennis, zoals deze blijkt uit de behaalde diploma's en graden, alsmede andere ter zake dienende bevoegdheden en bekwaamheden van een persoon, voor zover deze door de bevoegde autoriteiten aanvaardbaar worden geacht, Overwegend dat de erkenning door alle Overeenkomstsluitende Staten van gevolgde studies of behaalde diploma's, getuigschriften of graden in één van deze Staten beoogt de internationale mobiliteit van personen en de uitwisselingen van ideeën, kennis en wetenschappelijke en technologische ervaring te bevorderen, en dat het wenselijk zou zijn buitenlandse studenten aan instellingen voor hoger onderwijs te aanvaarden, op voorwaarde dat zij aan de erkenning van hun studies of diploma's in geen geval meer rechten kunnen ontlenen dan die welke studenten uit het desbetreffende land zelf genieten, Constaterend dat deze erkenning een van de onmisbare voorwaarden vormt om: 

1. de binnen hun grondgebied bestaande onderwijsvoorzieningen zo doeltreffend mogelijk te kunnen gebruiken,  

2. een grotere mobiliteit van docenten, studenten, wetenschappelijke onderzoekers en beroepsbeoefenaars te verzekeren,  

3. de moeilijkheden te verlichten die personen die in het buitenland een opleiding hebben gevolgd of onderwijs hebben genoten, ondervinden na hun terugkeer in eigen land,   Verlangend te verzekeren dat studies, getuigschriften, diploma's en graden op zo ruim mogelijke schaal worden erkend, met inachtneming van de beginselen van de bevordering van permanente educatie, de democratisering van het onderwijs, de aanvaarding en de toepassing van een onderwijsbeleid dat rekening houdt met de structurele, economische, technologische en sociale veranderingen en dat past in het culturele verband van ieder land, Vastbesloten hun toekomstige samenwerking dienaangaande te bekrachtigen en te regelen door middel van een overeenkomst die een eerste stap zal vormen op de weg naar een gezamenlijke voortvarende aanpak van alle vraagstukken op dit gebied, hetgeen in het bijzonder de taak zal zijn van reeds bestaande of eventueel noodzakelijk geachte nieuw in te stellen nationale, bilaterale, subregionale en multilaterale organen, Indachtig het feit dat de Algemene Conferentie van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur als uiteindelijk doel heeft gesteld „het ontwerpen van een internationale overeenkomst inzake de erkenning en de geldigheid van graden, diploma's en getuigschriften, toegekend door instellingen voor hoger onderwijs en voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek in alle landen”,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### I  

####BEGRIPSBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  1  

1.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder „erkenning” van een buitenlands getuigschrift of diploma of een buitenlandse graad verstaan de aanvaarding daarvan als geldig bewijsstuk door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Staat en het toekennen aan de bezitter daarvan van rechten als die welke personen genieten die een getuigschrift, diploma of graad uit eigen land bezitten, waarmee het buitenlandse getuigschrift of diploma of de buitenlandse graad vergelijkbaar wordt geacht. Erkenning wordt verder als volgt omschreven: 

(a) Erkenning van een getuigschrift, diploma of graad met het oog op het aanvangen of voortzetten van een studie op een hoger niveau, maakt het mogelijk de desbetreffende bezitter van een diploma, getuigschrift of graad in aanmerking te doen komen voor toelating tot de instellingen voor hoger onderwijs en voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek van iedere Overeenkomstsluitende Staat, als ware hij bezitter van een vergelijkbaar getuigschrift, diploma of graad, verleend in de desbetreffende Overeenkomstsluitende Staat. Een zodanige erkenning ontheft de bezitter van een buitenlands diploma of getuigschrift of van een buitenlandse graad niet van de verplichting zich te houden aan de voorwaarden (anders dan die welke verband houden met het bezit van een diploma) waaraan voor toelating tot de instelling voor hoger onderwijs of voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek van de ontvangende Staat moet worden voldaan.  

(b) Erkenning van een buitenlands getuigschrift of diploma of van een buitenlandse graad met het oog op uitoefening van een beroep betekent erkenning van de vooropleiding van de bezitter daarvan voor de uitoefening van het desbetreffende beroep, echter onverminderd de in de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Staten geldende wettelijke en beroepsregels en -procedures. Een zodanige erkenning ontheft de bezitter van een buitenlands getuigschrift of diploma of van een buitenlandse graad niet van de verplichting zich te houden aan andere eventuele voorwaarden die voor de uitoefening van het beroep zijn vastgesteld door de bevoegde overheidsinstanties of de voor dit beroep bevoegde instanties.  

(c) Aan erkenning van een getuigschrift, diploma of graad kan de bezitter daarvan echter in een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Staat niet meer rechten ontlenen dan hij zou genieten in het land waarin het getuigschrift, het diploma of de graad werd toegekend.     
2.  Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst wordt onder „gedeeltelijke studies” verstaan studie- of opleidingsperioden die, hoewel geen volledig studieprogramma omvattend, toch in aanzienlijke mate bijdragen tot de verwerving van kennis of vaardigheden.   

### II  

####DOELSTELLINGEN

### Artikel  2  

1.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Staten zijn voornemens door hun gezamenlijk optreden bij te dragen tot zowel de bevordering van de actieve samenwerking van alle landen in de Europese Regio ten behoeve van vrede en internationaal begrip, als tot de ontwikkeling van een doeltreffender samenwerking met andere Lid-Staten van de Unesco met betrekking tot een beter gebruik van hun potentieel op het gebied van onderwijs, technologie en wetenschap.   
2.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Staten geven plechtig uiting aan hun vaste voornemen nauw samen te werken binnen het kader van hun wetgeving en constitutionele bestel, alsook binnen het kader van de bestaande internationale overeenkomsten, ten einde: 

(a) in het belang van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten en in overeenstemming met hun algemene onderwijsbeleid en administratieve procedures, een optimaal gebruik van hun beschikbare voorzieningen op het gebied van onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek mogelijk te maken, en daartoe: 

(i) hun instellingen voor hoger onderwijs op zo ruim mogelijke schaal toegankelijk te maken voor studenten en wetenschappelijke onderzoekers uit elk van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten;  

(ii) de studies, getuigschriften, diploma's en graden van zodanige personen te erkennen;  

(iii) de mogelijkheid te onderzoeken om een analoge terminologie en analoge beoordelingsmaatstaven op te stellen en in te voeren, die de toepassing van een systeem vergemakkelijken dat de vergelijkbaarheid van de puntenwaardering, studievakken, getuigschriften, diploma's en graden verzekert;  

(iv) een dynamisch beleid te voeren inzake de toelating tot verdere studies, aan de hand van de blijkens getuigschriften, diploma's en graden verworven kennis, alsmede andere ter zake dienende bevoegdheden en bekwaamheden van de betrokken persoon, voor zover deze door de bevoegde instanties aanvaardbaar worden geacht;  

(v) bij het beoordelen van gedeeltelijke studies, soepele maatstaven aan te leggen, gebaseerd op het bereikte opleidingsniveau en op de gevolgde cursussen, rekening houdend met het interdisciplinaire karakter van de kennis op het niveau van hoger onderwijs;  

(vi) het systeem voor de uitwisseling van informatie met betrekking tot de erkenning van studies, getuigschriften, diploma's en graden te verbeteren;    

(b) de studieprogramma's in de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten, alsook de methoden voor het opzetten en bevorderen van hoger onderwijs voortdurend te verbeteren, niet alleen aan de hand van de behoeften voor economische, sociale en culturele ontwikkeling en het beleid van ieder land, alsmede van de doeleinden, vervat in de aanbevelingen van de bevoegde organen van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur betreffende de voortdurende verbetering van de kwaliteit van het onderwijs, de bevordering van permanente educatie en de democratisering van het onderwijs, maar ook op basis van het streven naar de volle ontplooiing van de menselijke persoonlijkheid en naar begrip, verdraagzaamheid en vriendschap tussen de volken en in het algemeen van alle doeleinden met betrekking tot de rechten van de mens, die het onderwijs behoort na te streven krachtens de Universele Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens, de Internationale Verdragen van de Verenigde Naties inzake de rechten van de mens, en het Verdrag van de Unesco nopens de bestrijding van discriminatie in het onderwijs;  

(c) regionale en mondiale samenwerking ten behoeve van de oplossing van de „problemen van vergelijking en gelijkwaardigheid van universitaire graden en diploma's” alsmede ten behoeve van de erkenning van studies en universitaire diploma's te bevorderen.     
3.  De Overeenkomstsluitende Staten komen overeen alle passende maatregelen op nationaal, bilateraal en multilateraal niveau te treffen, in het bijzonder door middel van bilaterale, subregionale, regionale of andere overeenkomsten, regelingen tussen universiteiten of andere instellingen voor hoger onderwijs, alsmede regelingen met de bevoegde nationale of internationale organisaties en andere lichamen, ten einde de betrokken bevoegde autoriteiten in de gelegenheid te stellen de in dit artikel omschreven doeleinden geleidelijk te verwezenlijken.
