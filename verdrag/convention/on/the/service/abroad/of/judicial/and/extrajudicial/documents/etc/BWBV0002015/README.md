####Convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters

The States signatory to the present Convention, Desiring to create appropriate means to ensure that judicial and extrajudicial documents to be served abroad shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in sufficient time, Desiring to improve the organisation of mutual judicial assistance for that purpose by simplifying and expediting the procedure, Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions:    

### Article  1  

The present Convention shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad. This Convention shall not apply where the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.  

### CHAPTER  I  

####JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS

### Article  2  

Each contracting State shall designate a Central Authority which will undertake to receive requests for service coming from other contracting States and to proceed in conformity with the provisions of articles 3 to 6. Each State shall organise the Central Authority in conformity with its own law.  

### Article  3  

The authority or judicial officer competent under the law of the State in which the documents originate shall forward to the Central Authority of the State addressed a request conforming to the model annexed to the present Convention, without any requirement of legalisation or other equivalent formality. The document to be served or a copy thereof shall be annexed to the request. The request and the document shall both be furnished in duplicate.  

### Article  4  

If the Central Authority considers that the request does not comply with the provisions of the present Convention it shall promptly inform the applicant and specify its objections to the request.  

### Article  5  

The Central Authority of the State addressed shall itself serve the document or shall arrange to have it served by an appropriate agency, either - 

(a) by a method prescribed by its internal law for the service of documents in domestic actions upon persons who are within its territory, or  

(b) by a particular method requested by the applicant, unless such a method is incompatible with the law of the State addressed.   Subject to sub-paragraph (b) of the first paragraph of this article, the document may always be served by delivery to an addressee who accepts it voluntarily. If the document is to be served under the first paragraph above, the Central Authority may require the document to be written in, or translated into, the official language or one of the official languages of the State addressed. That part of the request, in the form attached to the present Convention, which contains a summary of the document to be served, shall be served with the document.  

### Article  6  

The Central Authority of the State addressed or any authority which it may have designated for that purpose, shall complete a certificate in the form of the model annexed to the present Convention. The certificate shall state that the document has been served and shall include the method, the place and the date of service and the person to whom the document was delivered. If the document has not been served, the certificate shall set out the reasons which have prevented service. The applicant may require that a certificate not completed by a Central Authority or by a judicial authority shall be countersigned by one of these authorities. The certificate shall be forwarded directly to the applicant.  

### Article  7  

The standard terms in the model annexed to the present Convention shall in all cases be written either in French or in English. They may also be written in the official language, or in one of the official languages, of the State in which the documents originate. The corresponding blanks shall be completed either in the language of the State addressed or in French or in English.  

### Article  8  

Each contracting State shall be free to effect service of judicial documents upon persons abroad, without application of any compulsion, directly through its diplomatic or consular agents. Any State may declare that it is opposed to such service within its territory, unless the document is to be served upon a national of the State in which the documents originate.  

### Article  9  

Each contracting State shall be free, in addition, to use consular channels to forward documents, for the purpose of service, to those authorities of another contracting State wich are designated by the latter for this purpose. Each contracting State may, if exceptional circumstances so require, use diplomatic channels for the same purpose.  

### Article  10  

Provided the State of destination does not object, the present Convention shall not interfere with - 

(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,  

(b) the freedom of judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination,  

(c) the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination.    

### Article  11  

The present Convention shall not prevent two or more contracting States from agreeing to permit, for the purpose of service of judicial documents, channels of transmission other than those provided for in the preceding articles and, in particular, direct communication between their respective authorities.  

### Article  12  

The service of judicial documents coming from a contracting State shall not give rise to any payment or reimbursement of taxes or costs for the services rendered by the State addressed. The applicant shall pay or reimburse the costs occasioned by - 

(a) the employment of a judicial officer or of a person competent under the law of the State of destination,  

(b) the use of a particular method of service.    

### Article  13  

Where a request for service complies with the terms of the present Convention, the State addressed may refuse to comply therewith only if it deems that compliance would infringe its sovereignty or security. It may not refuse to comply solely on the ground that, under its internal law, it claims exclusive jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action or that its internal law would not permit the action upon which the application is based. The Central Authority shall, in case of refusal, promptly inform the applicant and state the reasons for the refusal.  

### Article  14  

Difficulties which may arise in connection with the transmission of judicial documents for service shall be settled through diplomatic channels.  

### Article  15  

Where a writ of summons or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad for the purpose of service, under the provisions of the present Convention, and the defendant has not appeared, judgment shall not be given until it is established that - 

(a) the document was served by a method prescribed by the internal law of the State addressed for the service of documents in domestic actions upon persons who are within its territory, or  

(b) the document was actually delivered to the defendant or to his residence by another method provided for by this Convention,   and that in either of these cases the service or the delivery was effected in sufficient time to enable the defendant to defend. Each contracting State shall be free to declare that the judge, notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph of this article, may give judgment even if no certificate of service or delivery has been received, if all the following conditions are fulfilled - 

(a) the document was transmitted by one of the methods provided for in this Convention,  

(b) a period of time of not less than six months, considered adequate by the judge in the particular case, has elapsed since the date of the transmission of the document,  

(c) no certificate of any kind has been received, even though every reasonable effort has been made to obtain it through the competent authorities of the State addressed.   Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs the judge may order, in case of urgency, any provisional or protective measures.  

### Article  16  

When a writ of summons or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad for the purpose of service, under the provisions of the present Convention, and a judgment has been entered against a defendant who has not appeared, the judge shall have the power to relieve the defendant from the effects of the expiration of the time for appeal from the judgment if the following conditions are fulfilled - 

(a) the defendant, without any fault on his part, did not have knowledge of the document in sufficient time to defend, or knowledge of the judgment in sufficient time to appeal, and  

(b) the defendant has disclosed a *prima facie* defence to the action on the merits.   An application for relief may be filed only within a reasonable time after the defendant has knowledge of the judgment. Each contracting State may declare that the application will not be entertained if it is filed after the expiration of a time to be stated in the declaration, but which shall in no case be less than one year following the date of the judgment. This article shall not apply to judgments concerning status or capacity of persons.  

### CHAPTER  II  

####EXTRAJUDICIAL DOCUMENTS

### Article  17  

Extrajudicial documents emanating from authorities and judicial officers of a contracting State may be transmitted for the purpose of service in another contracting State by the methods and under the provisions of the present Convention.  

### CHAPTER  III  

####GENERAL CLAUSES

Each contracting State may designate other authorities in addition to the Central Authority and shall determine the extent of their competence. The applicant shall, however, in all cases, have the right to address a request directly to the Central Authority. Federal States shall be free to designate more than one Central Authority.  

### Article  19

####Verdrag inzake de betekening en de kennisgeving in het buitenland van gerechtelijke en buitengerechtelijke stukken in burgerlijke en in handelszaken

De Staten die dit Verdrag hebben ondertekend, Verlangend maatregelen te nemen die er toe kunnen leiden dat gerechtelijke en buitengerechtelijke stukken waarvan in het buitenland betekening of kennisgeving moet worden gedaan, tijdig ter kennis komen van degenen voor wie zij bestemd zijn, Ernaar strevend tot dat doel de onderlinge rechtshulp te verbeteren door de daarbij te volgen procedure te vereenvoudigen en te versnellen; Hebben besloten te dien einde een Verdrag te sluiten en zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  1  

Dit Verdrag is van toepassing in alle gevallen waarin in burgerlijke zaken of in handelszaken een gerechtelijk of buitengerechtelijk stuk ter betekening of kennisgeving naar het buitenland moet worden gezonden. Het Verdrag is niet van toepassing, indien het adres van degene voor wie het stuk is bestemd, onbekend is.  

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####GERECHTELIJKE STUKKEN

### Artikel  2  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat wijst een centrale autoriteit aan, die tot taak heeft de uit een andere Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstige aanvragen om betekening of kennisgeving overeenkomstig de artikelen 3-6 in ontvangst te nemen en af te doen. De aangezochte Staat wijst de centrale autoriteit aan en regelt tevens haar werkwijze.  

### Artikel  3  

De daartoe volgens wet van de Staat van herkomst van het stuk bevoegde autoriteit of deurwaarder richt tot de centrale autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat een aanvrage, die moet overeenstemmen met het als bijlage aan dit Verdrag toegevoegde modelformulier. Ten aanzien van de aanvrage is geen legalisatie van stukken of een daarmede gelijk te stellen formaliteit vereist. De aanvrage moet vergezeld gaan van twee exemplaren van het gerechtelijke stuk of van twee afschriften daarvan.  

### Artikel  4  

Indien de centrale autoriteit oordeelt dat de bepalingen van het Verdrag niet in acht zijn genomen, stelt zij de aanvrager hiervan onverwijld in kennis, met nauwkeurige vermelding van de tegen de aanvrage gerezen bezwaren.  

### Artikel  5  

De centrale autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat belast zich met de betekening of de kennisgeving van het stuk of het doen betekenen of kennisgeven daarvan, 

a) hetzij met inachtneming van de vormen, in de wetgeving van de aangezochte Staat voorgeschreven voor de betekening of de kennisgeving van stukken die in dat land zijn opgemaakt en bestemd zijn voor zich aldaar bevindende personen,  

b) hetzij met inachtneming van een bijzondere, door de aanvrager verzochte vorm, mits deze niet in strijd is met de wet van de aangezochte Staat.   Behoudens in het geval bedoeld in het eerste lid onder b, kan het stuk altijd worden afgegeven aan degene voor wie het bestemd is, zo deze het vrijwillig aanneemt. Indien van het stuk betekening of kennisgeving moet worden gedaan overeenkomstig het bepaalde in het eerste lid, kan de centrale autoriteit verlangen dat het stuk wordt opgesteld of vertaald in de officiële taal of in een van de officiële talen van haar land. Het gedeelte van de aanvrage bestaande uit het als bijlage aan dit Verdrag toegevoegde modelformulier, dat aard en onderwerp van het te betekenen stuk weergeeft, wordt afgegeven aan degene voor wie het stuk bestemd is.  

### Artikel  6  

De centrale autoriteit van de aangezochte Staat, of de daarvoor door die Staat aangewezen autoriteit, maakt een verklaring op die moet overeenstemmen met het modelformulier voor zodanige verklaringen, dat als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is toegevoegd. De verklaring behelst dat aan de aanvrage uitvoering is gegeven en vermeldt tevens de vorm waarin, de plaats waar en het tijdstip waarop dit is geschied, alsmede de persoon aan wie het stuk is afgegeven. In voorkomend geval worden in de verklaring de omstandigheden vermeld die de uitvoering van de aanvrage hebben belet. Indien de verklaring niet is opgemaakt door de centrale autoriteit of een rechterlijke autoriteit, kan de aanvrager verlangen dat zij door een van deze autoriteiten voor gezien wordt getekend. De verklaring wordt rechtstreeks toegezonden aan de aanvrager.  

### Artikel  7  

Het te drukken gedeelte van het modelformulier, dat als bijlage aan dit Verdrag is toegevoegd, moet steeds in de Franse of in de Engelse taal zijn gesteld, doch kan daarenboven worden gesteld in de officiële taal of in een van de officiële talen van de Staat van herkomst der stukken. Hetgeen in de aansluitende witte vakken moet worden ingevuld dient hetzij in de taal van de aangezochte Staat, hetzij in de Franse taal, hetzij in de Engelse taal te worden gesteld.  

### Artikel  8  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat is bevoegd betekeningen of kennisgevingen van gerechtelijke stukken aan zich in het buitenland bevindende personen rechtstreeks, zonder rechtsdwang, door de zorg van zijn diplomatieke of consulaire ambtenaren te doen verrichten. Een Staat kan verklaren dat hij zich tegen de uitoefening van deze bevoegdheid op zijn grondgebied verzet, tenzij van het stuk betekening of kennisgeving moet worden gedaan aan een onderdaan van de Staat van herkomst van dat stuk.  

### Artikel  9  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat is bovendien bevoegd gerechtelijke stukken langs de consulaire weg ter betekening of kennisgeving toe te zenden aan de autoriteiten van een andere Verdragsluitende Staat die daarvoor door deze Staat zijn aangewezen. Indien buitengewone omstandigheden dit noodzakelijk maken, is iedere Verdragsluitende Staat bevoegd deze toezending langs de diplomatieke weg te doen geschieden.  

### Artikel  10  

Dit Verdrag laat, tenzij de Staat van bestemming verklaart zich daartegen te verzetten, onverlet: 

a) de bevoegdheid gerechtelijke stukken rechtstreeks over de post toe te zenden aan zich in het buitenland bevindende personen,  

b) de bevoegdheid van de deurwaarders, ambtenaren of andere bevoegde personen van de Staat van herkomst gerechtelijke stukken rechtstreeks door de deurwaarders, ambtenaren of andere bevoegde personen van de Staat van bestemming, betekening of kennisgeving te doen verrichten,  

c) de bevoegdheid van iedere belanghebbende bij een rechtsgeding betekeningen of kennisgevingen van gerechtelijke stukken rechtstreeks te doen verrichten door de deurwaarders, ambtenaren of andere bevoegde personen in de Staat van bestemming.    

### Artikel  11  

Dit Verdrag belet niet dat twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten over en weer toelaten dat ter betekening of kennisgeving van gerechtelijke stukken andere wegen worden gevolgd dan die, welke in de voorafgaande artikelen zijn geregeld, met name zich verstaan over rechtstreeks verkeer tussen hun wederzijdse autoriteiten.  

### Artikel  12  

De betekeningen of kennisgevingen van uit een Verdragsluitende Staat afkomstige gerechtelijke stukken geven geen aanleiding tot betaling of terugbetaling van heffingen of kosten voor de diensten welke door de aangezochte Staat zijn verleend. De aanvrager is gehouden de kosten te betalen of terug te betalen, veroorzaakt door: 

a) het optreden van een deurwaarder of van een volgens de wet van de Staat van bestemming bevoegde persoon,  

b) de inachtneming van een bijzondere vorm van betekening of kennisgeving.    

### Artikel  13  

De uitvoering van een aanvrage om betekening of kennisgeving overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag kan alleen worden geweigerd indien de aangezochte Staat oordeelt dat hierdoor inbreuk zou worden gemaakt op zijn soevereiniteit of veiligheid. De uitvoering kan niet worden geweigerd op de enkele grond dat de wet van de aangezochte Staat ten aanzien van de zaak waarop de aanvrage betrekking heeft, uitsluitende rechtsmacht voor die Staat opeist, dan wel een rechtsvordering als waarop de aanvrage betrekking heeft, niet toekent. Van de weigering een aanvrage uit te voeren stelt de centrale autoriteit de aanvrager, met vermelding van de redenen, onverwijld in kennis.  

### Artikel  14  

Moeilijkheden die naar aanleiding van de toezending, ter betekening of kennisgeving, van gerechtelijke stukken mochten ontstaan, worden langs de diplomatieke weg geregeld.  

### Artikel  15  

Wanneer een stuk dat het geding inleidt of een daarmede gelijk te stellen stuk ter betekening of kennisgeving overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, naar het buitenland moest worden gezonden en de verweerder niet is verschenen, houdt de rechter de beslissing aan totdat is gebleken dat: 

a) hetzij van het stuk betekening of kennisgeving is gedaan met inachtneming van de vormen in de wetgeving van de aangezochte Staat voorgeschreven voor de betekening of de kennisgeving van stukken die in dat land zijn opgemaakt en bestemd zijn voor zich op het grondgebied van dat land bevindende personen,  

b) hetzij het stuk aan de verweerder in persoon of aan zijn woonplaats is afgegeven op een andere in dit Verdrag geregelde wijze, en dat de betekening of de kennisgeving, onderscheidenlijk de afgifte zo tijdig is geschied dat de verweerder gelegenheid heeft gehad verweer te voeren.   ledere Verdragsluitende Staat is bevoegd te verklaren dat zijn rechters in afwijking van het bepaalde in het eerste lid een beslissing kunnen geven, ook als geen bewijs, hetzij van betekening of kennisgeving, hetzij van afgifte is ontvangen, indien aan elk van de volgende voorwaarden is voldaan: 

a) het stuk is toegezonden op een van de in dit Verdrag geregelde wijzen,  

b) sedert het tijdstip van toezending van het stuk een termijn is verlopen die door de rechter voor elk afzonderlijk geval zal worden vastgesteld, doch die ten minste zes maanden zal bedragen,  

c) in weerwil van alle daartoe bij de bevoegde autoriteiten aangewende pogingen geen bewijs kon worden verkregen.   Het bepaalde in dit artikel belet niet dat door de rechter in spoedeisende gevallen voorlopige of conservatoire maatregelen kunnen worden genomen.  

### Artikel  16  

Wanneer een stuk dat het geding inleidt of een daarmede gelijk te stellen stuk ter betekening of kennisgeving overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag naar het buitenland moest worden verzonden en de verweerder bij verstek werd veroordeeld, kan de rechter, indien de termijn waarbinnen een rechtsmiddel had moeten worden aangewend is verstreken, de gedaagde een nieuwe termijn toestaan binnen welke hij het rechtsmiddel alsnog kan aanwenden, mits is voldaan aan elk van de volgende voorwaarden: 

a) de verweerder heeft niet de gelegenheid gehad zich te verweren of een rechtsmiddel aan te wenden, doordat het stuk onderscheidenlijk de beslissing hem, buiten zijn schuld, niet tijdig heeft bereikt,  

b) de grieven van de verweerder zijn, naar het aanvankelijk oordeel van de rechter, niet van elke grond ontbloot.   Het verzoek om verlening van een nieuwe termijn voor de aanwending van het rechtsmiddel is slechts ontvankelijk, indien het is ingediend binnen een redelijke termijn na het tijdstip waarop de gedaagde van de beslissing kennis heeft gekregen. Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat is bevoegd te verklaren dat het verzoek niet ontvankelijk is, indien het is ingediend na het verstrijken van de in die verklaring genoemde termijn, welke echter niet korter mag zijn dan een jaar, te rekenen van de dag waarop de beslissing is gegeven. Het bepaalde in dit artikel is niet van toepassing op beslissingen betreffende de staat van personen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####BUITENGERECHTELIJKE STUKKEN

### Artikel  17  

Buitengerechtelijke stukken, afkomstig van autoriteiten en deurwaarders van een Verdragsluitende Staat, kunnen ter betekening of kennisgeving in een andere Verdragsluitende Staat worden toegezonden op de wijzen en onder de voorwaarden als in dit Verdrag geregeld.  

### HOOFDSTUK  III  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN

### Artikel  18  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat kan naast de centrale autoriteit andere autoriteiten aanwijzen, wier bevoegdheden door die Staat worden geregeld. De aanvrager heeft echter steeds het recht zich rechtstreeks tot de centrale autoriteit te wenden. Bondsstaten zijn bevoegd meer dan een centrale autoriteit aan te wijzen.  

### Artikel  19  

Dit Verdrag belet niet dat door de interne wet van een Verdragsluitende Staat voor de betekening of de kennisgeving in die Staat van uit het buitenland afkomstige stukken, andere wijzen van toezending worden toegelaten dan die, geregeld in de voorafgaande artikelen.  

### Artikel  20  

Dit Verdrag belet niet dat twee of meer Verdragsluitende Staten overeenkomen af te wijken van het bepaalde in: 

a) artikel 3, tweede lid, betreffende de toezending van twee exemplaren van de stukken,  

b) artikel 5, derde lid, en artikel 7, betreffende de te bezigen taal,  

c) artikel 5, vierde lid,  

d) artikel 12, tweede lid.    

### Artikel  21  

Iedere Verdragsluitende Staat geeft hetzij op het tijdstip van de nederlegging van zijn akte van bekrachtiging of toetreding, hetzij op een later tijdstip, het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken van Nederland kennis van: 

a) de aanwijzing van de autoriteiten, bedoeld in de artikelen 2 en 18,  

b) de aanwijzing van de autoriteit bevoegd tot het opstellen van de in artikel 6 bedoelde verklaring,  

c) de aanwijzing van de autoriteit bevoegd tot het in ontvangst nemen van stukken die overeenkomstig artikel 9 langs de consulaire weg zijn toegezonden.   In voorkomend geval geeft een Verdragsluitende Staat het Ministerie op een van de genoemde tijdstippen kennis van: 

a) zijn bezwaren tegen de wijzen van toezending, bedoeld bij artikelen 8 en 10,  

b) de verklaringen, bedoeld bij de artikelen 15, tweede lid, en 16, derde lid,  

c) elke wijziging van de bovengenoemde aanwijzingen, bezwaren en verklaringen.    

### Artikel  22  

Dit Verdrag vervangt in de rechtsbetrekkingen tussen de Staten die het hebben bekrachtigd, de artikelen 1-7 van het op 17 juli 1905 te 's-Gravenhage ondertekende Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering, onderscheidenlijk van het op 1 maart 1954 te 's-Gravenhage ondertekende Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering, al naar gelang bedoelde Staten partij zijn bij een dezer of bij beide Verdragen.  

### Artikel  23  

Dit Verdrag belet noch de toepassing van artikel 23 van het op 17 juli 1905 te 's-Gravenhage ondertekende Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering, noch die van artikel 24 van het op 1 maart 1954 te 's-Gravenhage ondertekende Verdrag betreffende de burgerlijke rechtsvordering. Deze artikelen zijn echter slechts van toepassing, indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van eveneens in die Verdragen geregelde wijzen van toezending.  

### Artikel  24  

Door de Verdragsluitende Staten in aansluiting aan de genoemde Verdragen van 1905 en 1954 gesloten overeenkomsten worden geacht eveneens van toepassing te zijn op het onderhavige Verdrag, tenzij de betrokken Staten dienaangaande anders zijn overeengekomen.  

### Artikel  25  

Onverminderd het bepaalde in de artikelen 22 en 24 laat het onderhavige Verdrag onverlet de Verdragen, waarbij de Verdragsluitende Staten partij zijn of zullen worden, en welke bepalingen bevatten over door het onderhavige Verdrag geregelde onderwerpen.  

### Artikel  26  

Dit Verdrag staat ter ondertekening open voor de Staten die waren vertegenwoordigd op de tiende zitting van de Haagse Conferentie voor internationaal privaatrecht. Het dient te worden bekrachtigd en de akten van bekrachtiging zullen worden nedergelegd bij het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken van Nederland.
