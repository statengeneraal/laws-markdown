### Bijlage  II  

####Procedure voor de onderzoekscommissie ingevolge de artikelen 4 en 5

### 1  

De verzoekende partij(en) deelt (delen) het secretariaat mede dat zij een vraagstuk of vraagstukken voorlegt (voorleggen) aan een onderzoekscommissie, ingesteld in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Bijlage. In de mededeling dient het onderwerp van het onderzoek te zijn vermeld. Het secretariaat stelt alle Partijen bij het Verdrag onmiddellijk in kennis van het verzoek om een onderzoek.  

### 2  

De onderzoekscommissie bestaat uit drie leden. Zowel de verzoekende partij als de andere bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partij benoemen een wetenschappelijke of technische deskundige en de twee aldus benoemde deskundigen wijzen in onderlinge overeenstemming een derde deskundige aan, die voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie is. Laatstbedoelde mag geen onderdaan zijn van één van de bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen, noch zijn vaste woonplaats op het grondgebied van één van die partijen hebben, noch werkzaam zijn in dienst van één van hen, noch zich in enigerlei hoedanigheid met de zaak hebben beziggehouden.  

### 3  

Indien binnen twee maanden na de benoeming van de tweede deskundige geen voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie is aangewezen, wijst de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa op verzoek van één van de partijen de voorzitter aan binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden.  

### 4  

Indien één van de bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen geen deskundige benoemt binnen een maand nadat zij de kennisgeving van het secretariaat heeft ontvangen, kan de andere partij hiervan kennisgeving doen aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die de voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie aanwijst binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden. Na zijn aanwijzing verzoekt de voorzitter van de onderzoekscommissie de partij die geen deskundige heeft benoemd, dit binnen een maand te doen. Indien zij verzuimt dit binnen die termijn te doen, doet de voorzitter hiervan kennisgeving aan de Uitvoerend Secretaris van de Economische Commissie voor Europa, die deze benoeming verricht binnen een volgende termijn van twee maanden.  

### 5  

De onderzoekscommissie stelt haar eigen reglement van orde vast.  

### 6  

De onderzoekscommissie neemt alle passende maatregelen om haar taken te verrichten.  

### 7  

De bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen dienen het werk van de onderzoekscommissie te vergemakkelijken en dienen met name met gebruikmaking van alle hun ter beschikking staande middelen: 

a. de onderzoekscommissie alle ter zake dienende documenten, voorzieningen en inlichtingen te verschaffen;  

b. de onderzoekscommissie, indien noodzakelijk, in staat te stellen getuigen en deskundigen op te roepen en kennis te nemen van hun verklaringen.    

### 8  

De partijen en de deskundigen beschermen het vertrouwelijk karakter van alle informatie die zij in vertrouwen ontvangen in de loop van de werkzaamheden van de onderzoekscommissie.  

### 9  

Indien één van de bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen niet voor de onderzoekscommissie verschijnt of verzuimt haar standpunt kenbaar te maken, kan de andere partij de onderzoekscommissie verzoeken de procedure voort te zetten en haar werk te voltooien. Het nietverschijnen van een partij of het verzuim haar standpunt kenbaar te maken vormt geen beletsel voor de voortzetting en de voltooiing van het werk van de onderzoekscommissie  

### 10  

De kosten van de onderzoekscommissie, met inbegrip van de bezoldiging van haar leden, worden in gelijke delen gedragen door de bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen, tenzij de onderzoekscommissie anders beslist, gelet op de bijzondere omstandigheden van de zaak. De onderzoekscommissie houdt aantekening van al haar uitgaven en doet de partijen een eindoverzicht toekomen.  

### 11  

Elke Partij die een belang van materiële aard bij het onderwerp van de onderzoeksprocedure heeft en die door het advies van de onderzoekscommissie kan worden geraakt, kan met instemming van de onderzoekscommissie interveniëren in de procedure.  

### 12  

De beslissingen van de onderzoekscommissie inzake procedurele aangelegenheden worden genomen met een meerderheid van stemmen van haar leden. Het eindoordeel van de onderzoekscommissie dient een afspiegeling te zijn van het standpunt van de meerderheid van haar leden en zal een eventueel afwijkende mening omvatten.  

### 13  

De onderzoekscommissie geeft haar eindoordeel binnen twee maanden na de datum waarop zij is ingesteld, tenzij zij het noodzakelijk acht deze termijn met een duur van ten hoogste twee maanden te verlengen.  

### 14  

Het eindoordeel van de onderzoekscommissie dient te zijn gebaseerd op aanvaarde wetenschappelijke beginselen. Het eindoordeel wordt door de onderzoekscommissie toegezonden aan de bij de onderzoeksprocedure betrokken partijen en aan het secretariaat.  

### Bijlage  III  

####Ingevolge artikel 4 te volgen procedures

### 1  

Een Partij van herkomst kan verzoeken om overleg met een andere Partij in overeenstemming met de tweede tot en met de vijfde paragraaf van deze Bijlage ten einde vast te stellen of die Partij een benadeelde Partij is.  

### 2  

Indien een voorgenomen of bestaande activiteit gevaarlijk is, dient de Partij van herkomst, ten einde adequaat en doeltreffend overleg te kunnen voeren, op passende niveaus kennisgeving te doen aan elke Partij die naar haar oordeel een benadeelde Partij kan worden, zulks zo vroeg mogelijk en niet later dan het tijdstip waarop zij haar eigen publiek inlicht over die voorgenomen of bestaande activiteit. Bij bestaande gevaarlijke activiteiten dient die kennisgeving uiterlijk twee jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag voor een Partij van herkomst te worden gedaan.  

### 3  

De kennisgeving dient, onder andere, te bevatten: 

a. informatie over de gevaarlijke activiteit, met inbegrip van alle beschikbare informatie of rapporten, zoals overeenkomstig artikel 6 verstrekte informatie over de mogelijke grensoverschrijdende gevolgen ervan in geval van een industrieel ongeval;  

b. een aanduiding van een redelijke termijn waarbinnen een antwoord ingevolge de vierde paragraaf van deze Bijlage moet worden gegeven, rekening houdend met de aard van de activiteit;   en kan de in zesde paragraaf van deze Bijlage genoemde informatie bevatten.  

### 4  

De in kennis gestelde Partijen dienen de Partij van herkomst te antwoorden binnen de in de kennisgeving vermelde termijn, daarbij de ontvangst van de kennisgeving bevestigend en aangevend of zij voornemens zijn overleg te plegen.  

### 5  

Indien een in kennis gestelde Partij aangeeft dat zij niet voornemens is overleg te plegen, of niet antwoordt binnen de in de kennisgeving vermelde termijn, zijn de bepalingen van de volgende paragrafen van deze Bijlage niet van toepassing. In dergelijke gevallen heeft de Partij van herkomst onverminderd het recht te bepalen of zij overgaat tot een beoordeling en analyse op grond van haar eigen nationale wetgeving en praktijk.  

### 6  

Na ontvangst van een antwoord van een in kennis gestelde Partij waarin deze aangeeft dat zij overlegt wenst te plegen, verschaft de Partij van herkomst de in kennis gestelde Partij, indien zij zulks nog niet heeft gedaan: 

a. relevante informatie betreffende het tijdschema voor de analyse, met inbegrip van een tijdschema voor het toezenden van commentaar;  

b. relevante informatie betreffende de gevaarlijke activiteit en de grensoverschrijdende gevolgen daarvan in geval van een industrieel ongeval;  

c. de mogelijkheid deel te nemen aan de evaluatie van informatie of rapporten waaruit eventuele grensoverschrijdende gevolgen blijken.    

### 7  

Een benadeelde Partij verstrekt de Partij van herkomst, op haar verzoek, de redelijkerwijs verkrijgbare informatie betreffende het onder de rechtsmacht van de benadeelde Partij vallende gebied dat zou kunnen worden geraakt, wanneer die informatie nodig is om te kunnen overgaan tot een beoordeling en analyse en om maatregelen te kunnen nemen. De informatie wordt onmiddellijk verstrekt en, indien van toepassing, via een gezamenlijk orgaan, wanneer dit bestaat.  

### 8  

De Partij van herkomst verstrekt de benadeelde Partij, indien van toepassing, rechtstreeks of, indien zulks bestaat, via een gezamenlijk orgaan, de desbetreffende documenten aangaande de analyse en evaluatie als beschreven in Bijlage V, eerste en tweede paragraaf.  

### 9  

De betrokken Partijen informeren het publiek in gebieden die redelijkerwijs zouden kunnen worden geraakt door de gevaarlijke activiteit en dragen zorg voor de verspreiding van documenten aangaande de analyse en evaluatie onder dit publiek en de autoriteiten in de desbetreffende gebieden. De Partijen stellen hen in de gelegenheid hun opmerkingen en bezwaren ten aanzien van de gevaarlijke activiteit kenbaar te maken en dragen er zorg voor dat hun standpunten worden voorgelegd aan de bevoegde autoriteit van de Partij van herkomst, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij, indien van toepassing, door tussenkomst van de Partij van herkomst, zulks binnen een redelijke termijn.  

### 10  

De Partij van herkomst pleegt, zodra de documenten aangaande de analyse en evaluatie gereed zijn, onverwijld overleg met de benadeelde Partij over, onder meer, de grensoverschrijdende gevolgen van de gevaarlijke activiteit in geval van een industrieel ongeval en over maatregelen om de gevolgen daarvan te beperken of uit te sluiten. Het overleg kan betrekking hebben op: 

a. mogelijke alternatieven voor de gevaarlijke activiteit, met inbegrip van het nulalternatief, en maatregelen die kunnen worden genomen om de grensoverschrijdende gevolgen te beperken op kosten van de Partij van herkomst;  

b. andere vormen van mogelijke wederzijdse bijstand ter beperking van grensoverschrijdende gevolgen;  

c. alle andere daarvoor in aanmerking komende aangelegenheden. De betrokken Partijen komen aan het begin van het overleg een redelijk tijdsbestek overeen voor de duur van de overlegperiode. Bedoeld overleg kan worden gevoerd via een passend gezamenlijk orgaan, indien dit bestaat.    

### 11  

De betrokken Partijen zien erop toe dat naar behoren rekening wordt gehouden met de analyse en evaluatie, alsook met het ingevolge de negende paragraaf van deze Bijlage ontvangen commentaar en het resultaat van het in de tiende paragraaf van deze Bijlage bedoelde overleg.  

### 12  

De Partij van herkomst stelt de benadeelde Partijen in kennis van elke beslissing aangaande de activiteit, alsmede van de redenen en overwegingen waarop deze is gegrond.  

### 13  

Indien een betrokken Partij kennis neemt van aanvullende relevante informatie betreffende de grensoverschrijdende gevolgen van een gevaarlijke activiteit die niet beschikbaar was op het tijdstip waarop het overleg met betrekking tot die activiteit plaatsvond, brengt die Partij de andere betrokken Partij (en) hiervan onmiddellijk op de hoogte. Indien één van de betrokken Partijen hierom verzoekt, wordt opnieuw overleg gevoerd.  

### Bijlage  IV
