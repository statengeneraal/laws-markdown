7.  If the doubt or concern of a State Party about a possible non-compliance has not been resolved within 60 days after the submission of the request for clarification to the Executive Council, or it believes its doubts warrant urgent consideration, notwithstanding its right to request a challenge inspection, it may request a special session of the Conference in accordance with Article VIII, paragraph 12 (c). At such a special session, the Conference shall consider the matter and may recommend any measure it deems appropriate to resolve the situation.  
### *Procedures for Challenge Inspections* 

8.  Each State Party has the right to request an on-site challenge inspection of any facility or location in the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction or control of any other State Party for the sole purpose of clarifying and resolving any questions concerning possible non-compliance with the provisions of this Convention, and to have this inspection conducted anywhere without delay by an inspection team designated by the Director-General and in accordance with the Verification Annex.   
9.  Each State Party is under the obligation to keep the inspection request within the scope of this Convention and to provide in the inspection request all appropriate information on the basis of which a concern has arisen regarding possible non-compliance with this Convention as specified in the Verification Annex. Each State Party shall refrain from unfounded inspection requests, care being taken to avoid abuse. The challenge inspection shall be carried out for the sole purpose of determining facts relating to the possible non-compliance.   
10.  For the purpose of verifying compliance with the provisions of this Convention, each State Party shall permit the Technical Secretariat to conduct the on-site challenge inspection pursuant to paragraph 8.   
11.  Pursuant to a request for a challenge inspection of a facility or location, and in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Verification Annex, the inspected State Party shall have: 

a) The right and the obligation to make every reasonable effort to demonstrate its compliance with this Convention and, to this end, to enable the inspection team to fulfil its mandate;

14.  The Director-General shall immediately ascertain that the inspection request meets the requirements specified in Part X, paragraph 4, of the Verification Annex, and, if necessary, assist the requesting State Party in filing the inspection request accordingly. When the inspection request fulfils the requirements, preparations for the challenge inspection shall begin.   
15.  The Director-General shall transmit the inspection request to the inspected State Party not less than 12 hours before the planned arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry.   
16.  After having received the inspection request, the Executive Council shall take cognizance of the Director-General's actions on the request and shall keep the case under its consideration throughout the inspection procedure. However, its deliberations shall not delay the inspection process.   
17.  The Executive Council may, not later than 12 hours after having received the inspection request, decide by a three-quarter majority of all its members against carrying out the challenge inspection, if it considers the inspection request to be frivolous, abusive or clearly beyond the scope of this Convention as described in paragraph 8. Neither the requesting nor the inspected State Party shall participate in such a decision. If the Executive Council decides against the challenge inspection, preparations shall be stopped, no further action on the inspection request shall be taken, and the States Parties concerned shall be informed accordingly.

The final report shall contain the factual findings as well as an assessment by the inspection team of the degree and nature of access and cooperation granted for the satisfactory implementation of the challenge inspection. The Director-General shall promptly transmit the final report of the inspection team to the requesting State Party, to the inspected State Party, to the Executive Council and to all other States Parties. The Director-General shall further transmit promptly to the Executive Council the assessments of the requesting and of the inspected States Parties, as well as the views of other States Parties which may be conveyed to the Director-General for that purpose, and then provide them to all States Parties.

In the case of abuse, the Executive Council shall examine whether the requesting State Party should bear any of the financial implications of the challenge inspection.   
24.  The requesting State Party and the inspected State Party shall have the right to participate in the review process. The Executive Council shall inform the States Parties and the next session of the Conference of the outcome of the process.

####DESTRUCTION

#### *Principles and methods for destruction of chemical weapons* 

### 12  

"Destruction of chemical weapons" means a process by which chemicals are converted in an essentially irreversible way to a form unsuitable for production of chemical weapons, and which in an irreversible manner renders munitions and other devices unusable as such.  

### 13  

Each State Party shall determine how it shall destroy chemical weapons, except that the following processes may not be used: dumping in any body of water, land burial or open-pit burning. It shall destroy chemical weapons only at specifically designated and appropriately designed and equipped facilities.  

### 14  

Each State Party shall ensure that its chemical weapons destruction facilities are constructed and operated in a manner to ensure the destruction of the chemical weapons; and that the destruction process can be verified under the provisions of this Convention.  

#### *Order of destruction* 

### 15  

The order of destruction of chemical weapons is based on the obligations specified in Article I and the other Articles, including obligations regarding systematic on-site verification. It takes into account interests of States Parties for undiminished security during the destruction period; confidence-building in the early part of the destruction stage; gradual acquisition of experience in the course of destroying chemical weapons; and applicability irrespective of the actual composition of the stockpiles and the methods chosen for the destruction of the chemical weapons. The order of destruction is based on the principle of levelling out.  

### 16  

For the purpose of destruction, chemical weapons declared by each State Party shall be divided into three categories:  

|
|
| Category 1:  | Chemical weapons on the basis of Schedule 1 chemicals and their parts and components;  |
| Category 2:  | Chemical weapons on the basis of all other chemicals and their parts and components;  |
| Category 3:  | Unfilled munitions and devices, and equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with employment of chemical weapons.  |

### 17  

A State Party shall start: 

a) The destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons not later than two years after this Convention enters into force for it, and shall complete the destruction not later than 10 years after entry into force of this Convention. A State Party shall destroy chemical weapons in accordance with the following destruction deadlines: 

(i) Phase 1: Not later than two years after entry into force of this Convention, testing of its first destruction facility shall be completed. Not less than 1 per cent of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than three years after the entry into force of this Convention;  

(ii) Phase 2: Not less than 20 per cent of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention;  

(iii) Phase 3: Not less than 45 per cent of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than seven years after the entry into force of this Convention;  

(iv) Phase 4: All Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention.    

b) The destruction of Category 2 chemical weapons not later than one year after this Convention enters into force for it and shall complete the destruction not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention. Category 2 chemical weapons shall be destroyed in equal annual increments throughout the destruction period. The comparison factor for such weapons is the weight of the chemicals within Category 2; and  

c) The destruction of Category 3 chemical weapons not later than one year after this Convention enters into force for it, and shall complete the destruction not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention. Category 3 chemical weapons shall be destroyed in equal annual increments throughout the destruction period. The comparison factor for unfilled munitions and devices is expressed in nominal fill volume (m <sup>3</sup>) and for equipment in number of items.    

### 18  

For the destruction of binary chemical weapons the following shall apply: 

a) For the purposes of the order of destruction, a declared quantity (in tonnes) of the key component intended for a specific toxic end-product shall be considered equivalent to the quantity (in tonnes) of this toxic end-product calculated on a stoichiometric basis assuming 100 per cent yield.  

b) A requirement to destroy a given quantity of the key component shall entail a requirement to destroy a corresponding quantity of the other component, calculated from the actual weight ratio of the components in the relevant type of binary chemical munition device.  

c) If more of the other component is declared than is needed, based on the actual weight ratio between components, the excess shall be destroyed over the first two years after destruction operations begin.  

d) At the end of each subsequent operational year a State Party may retain an amount of the other declared component that is determined on the basis of the actual weight ratio of the components in the relevant type of binary chemical munition device.    

### 19  

For multicomponent chemical weapons the order of destruction shall be analogous to that envisaged for binary chemical weapons.  

#### *Modification of intermediate destruction deadlines* 

### 20  

The Executive Council shall review the general plans for destruction of chemical weapons, submitted pursuant to Article III, paragraph 1 (a) (v), and in accordance with paragraph 6, *inter alia,* to assess their conformity with the order of destruction set forth in paragraphs 15 to 19. The Executive Council shall consult with any State Party whose plan does not conform, with the objective of bringing the plan into conformity.  

### 21  

If a State Party, due to exceptional circumstances beyond its control, believes that it cannot achieve the level of destruction specified for Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 of the order of destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons, it may propose changes in those levels. Such a proposal must be made not later than 120 days after the entry into force of this Convention and shall contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the proposal.  

### 22  

Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to ensure destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons in accordance with the destruction deadlines set forth in paragraph 17 (a) as changed pursuant to paragraph 21. However, if a State Party believes that it will be unable to ensure the destruction of the percentage of Category 1 chemical weapons required by an intermediate destruction deadline, it may request the Executive Council to recommend to the Conference to grant an extension of its obligation to meet that deadline. Such a request must be made not less than 180 days before the intermediate destruction deadline and shall contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the request and the plans of the State Party for ensuring that it will be able to fulfil its obligation to meet the next intermediate destruction deadline.  

### 23  

If an extension is granted, the State Party shall still be under the obligation to meet the cumulative destruction requirements set forth for the next destruction deadline. Extensions granted pursuant to this Section shall not, in any way, modify the obligation of the State Party to destroy all Category 1 chemical weapons not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention.  

#### *Extension of the deadline for completion of destruction* 

### 24  

If a State Party believes that it will be unable to ensure the destruction of all Category 1 chemical weapons not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention, it may submit a request to the Executive Council for an extension of the deadline for completing the destruction of such chemical weapons. Such a request must be made not later than nine years after the entry into force of this Convention.

### 10  

The Director-General shall, not less than 12 hours before the planned arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry, inform the Executive Council about the location of the inspection site as specified in paragraph 7.  

### 11  

Contemporaneously with informing the Executive Council according to paragraph 10, the Director-General shall transmit the inspection request to the inspected State Party including the location of the inspection site as specified in paragraph 7. This notification shall also include the information specified in Part II, paragraph 32, of this Annex.  

### 12  

Upon arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry, the inspected State Party shall be informed by the inspection team of the inspection mandate.  

#### *Entry into the territory of the inspected State Party or the Host State* 

### 13  

The Director-General shall, in accordance with Article IX, paragraphs 13 to 18, dispatch an inspection team as soon as possible after an inspection request has been received. The inspection team shall arrive at the point of entry specified in the request in the minimum time possible, consistent with the provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11.  

### 14  

If the requested perimeter is acceptable to the inspected State Party, it shall be designated as the final perimeter as early as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry. The inspected State Party shall transport the inspection team to the final perimeter of the inspection site. If the inspected State Party deems it necessary, such transportation may begin up to 12 hours before the expiry of the time period specified in this paragraph for the designation of the final perimeter. Transportation shall, in any case, be completed not later than 36 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry.  

### 15  

For all declared facilities, the procedures in subparagraphs a) and b) shall apply. (For the purposes of this Part, "declared facility" means all facilities declared pursuant to Articles III, IV, and V. With regard to Article VI, "declared facility" means only facilities declared pursuant to Part VI of this Annex, as well as declared plants specified by declarations pursuant to Part VII, paragraphs 7 and 10 c), and Part VIII, paragraphs 7 and 10 c), of this Annex.) 

a) If the requested perimeter is contained within or conforms with the declared perimeter, the declared perimeter shall be considered the final perimeter. The final perimeter may, however, if agreed by the inspected State Party, be made smaller in order to conform with the perimeter requested by the requesting State Party.  

b) The inspected State Party shall transport the inspection team to the final perimeter as soon as practicable, but in any case shall ensure their arrival at the perimeter not later than 24 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry.    

#### *Alternative determination of final perimeter* 

### 16  

At the point of entry, if the inspected State Party cannot accept the requested perimeter, it shall propose an alternative perimeter as soon as possible, but in any case not later than 24 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry. In case of differences of opinion, the inspected State Party and the inspection team shall engage in negotiations with the aim of reaching agreement on a final perimeter.  

### 17  

The alternative perimeter should be designated as specifically as possible in accordance with paragraph 8. It shall include the whole of the requested perimeter and should, as a rule, bear a close relationship to the latter, taking into account natural terrain features and man-made boundaries. It should normally run close to the surrounding security barrier if such a barrier exists. The inspected State Party should seek to establish such a relationship between the perimeters by a combination of at least two of the following means: 

a) An alternative perimeter that does not extend to an area significantly greater than that of the requested perimeter;  

b) An alternative perimeter that is a short, uniform distance from the requested perimeter;  

c) At least part of the requested perimeter is visible from the alternative perimeter.    

### 18  

If the alternative perimeter is acceptable to the inspection team, it shall become the final perimeter and the inspection team shall be transported from the point of entry to that perimeter. If the inspected State Party deems it necessary, such transportation may begin up to 12 hours before the expiry of the time period specified in paragraph 16 for proposing an alternative perimeter. Transportation shall, in any case, be completed not later than 36 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry.  

### 19  

If a final perimeter is not agreed, the perimeter negotiations shall be concluded as early as possible, but in no case shall they continue more than 24 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry. If no agreement is reached, the inspected State Party shall transport the inspection team to a location at the alternative perimeter. If the inspected State Party deems it necessary, such transportation may begin up to 12 hours before the expiry of the time period specified in paragraph 16 for proposing an alternative perimeter. Transportation shall, in any case, be completed not later than 36 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry.  

### 20  

Once at the location, the inspected State Party shall provide the inspection team with prompt access to the alternative perimeter to facilitate negotiations and agreement on the final perimeter and access within the final perimeter.  

### 21  

If no agreement is reached within 72 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the location, the alternative perimeter shall be designated the final perimeter.  

#### *Verification of location* 

### 22  

To help establish that the inspection site to which the inspection team has been transported corresponds to the inspection site specified by the requesting State Party, the inspection team shall have the right to use approved location-finding equipment and have such equipment installed according to its directions. The inspection team may verify its location by reference to local landmarks identified from maps. The inspected State Party shall assist the inspection team in this task.  

#### *Securing the site, exit monitoring* 

### 23  

Not later than 12 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry, the inspected State Party shall begin collecting factual information of all vehicular exit activity from all exit points for all land, air, and water vehicles of the requested perimeter. It shall provide this information to the inspection team upon its arrival at the alternative or final perimeter, whichever occurs first.  

### 24  

This obligation may be met by collecting factual information in the form of traffic logs, photographs, video recordings, or data from chemical evidence equipment provided by the inspection team to monitor such exit activity. Alternatively, the inspected State Party may also meet this obligation by allowing one or more members of the inspection team independently to maintain traffic logs, take photographs, make video recordings of exit traffic, or use chemical evidence equipment, and conduct other activities as may be agreed between the inspected State Party and the inspection team.  

### 25  

Upon the inspection team's arrival at the alternative perimeter or final perimeter, whichever occurs first, securing the site, which means exit monitoring procedures by the inspection team, shall begin.  

### 26  

Such procedures shall include: the identification of vehicular exits, the making of traffic logs, the taking of photographs, and the making of video recordings by the inspection team of exits and exit traffic. The inspection team has the right to go, under escort, to any other part of the perimeter to check that there is no other exit activity.  

### 27  

Additional procedures for exit monitoring activities as agreed upon by the inspection team and the inspected State Party may include, *inter alia:* 

a) Use of sensors;  

b) Random selective access;  

c) Sample analysis.    

### 28  

All activities for securing the site and exit monitoring shall take place within a band around the outside of the perimeter, not exceeding 50 metres in width, measured outward.  

### 29  

The inspection team has the right to inspect on a managed access basis vehicular traffic exiting the site. The inspected State Party shall make every reasonable effort to demonstrate to the inspection team that any vehicle, subject to inspection, to which the inspection team is not granted full access, is not being used for purposes related to the possible non-compliance concerns raised in the inspection request.  

### 30  

Personnel and vehicles entering and personnel and personal passenger vehicles exiting the site are not subject to inspection.  

### 31  

The application of the above procedures may continue for the duration of the inspection, but may not unreasonably hamper or delay the normal operation of the facility.  

#### *Pre-inspection briefing and inspection plan* 

### 32  

To facilitate development of an inspection plan, the inspected State Party shall provide a safety and logistical briefing to the inspection team prior to access.  

### 33  

The pre-inspection briefing shall be held in accordance with Part II, paragraph 37, of this Annex. In the course of the pre-inspection briefing, the inspected State Party may indicate to the inspection team the equipment, documentation, or areas it considers sensitive and not related to the purpose of the challenge inspection. In addition, personnel responsible for the site shall brief the inspection team on the physical layout and other relevant characteristics of the site. The inspection team shall be provided with a map or sketch drawn to scale showing all structures and significant geographic features at the site. The inspection team shall also be briefed on the availability of facility personnel and records.  

### 34  

After the pre-inspection briefing, the inspection team shall prepare, on the basis of the information available and appropriate to it, an initial inspection plan which specifies the activities to be carried out by the inspection team, including the specific areas of the site to which access is desired. The inspection plan shall also specify whether the inspection team will be divided into subgroups. The inspection plan shall be made available to the representatives of the inspected State Party and the inspection site. Its implementation shall be consistent with the provisions of Section C, including those related to access and activities.  

#### *Perimeter activities* 

### 35  

Upon the inspection team's arrival at the final or alternative perimeter, whichever occurs first, the team shall have the right to commence immediately perimeter activities in accordance with the procedures set forth under this Section, and to continue these activities until the completion of the challenge inspection.  

### 36  

In conducting the perimeter activities, the inspection team shall have the right to: 

a) Use monitoring instruments in accordance with Part II, paragraphs 27 to 30, of this Annex;  

b) Take wipes, air, soil or effluent samples; and  

c) Conduct any additional activities which may be agreed between the inspection team and the inspected State Party.    

### 37  

The perimeter activities of the inspection team may be conducted within a band around the outside of the perimeter up to 50 metres in width measured outward from the perimeter. If the inspected State Party agrees, the inspection team may also have access to any building or structure within the perimeter band. All directional monitoring shall be oriented inward. For declared facilities, at the discretion of the inspected State Party, the band could run inside, outside, or on both sides of the declared perimeter.  

### C  

####CONDUCT OF INSPECTIONS

#### *General rules* 

### 38  

The inspected State Party shall provide access within the requested perimeter as well as, if different, the final perimeter. The extent and nature of access to a particular place or places within these perimeters shall be negotiated between the inspection team and the inspected State Party on a managed access basis.  

### 39  

The inspected State Party shall provide access within the requested perimeter as soon as possible, but in any case not later than 108 hours after the arrival of the inspection team at the point of entry in order to clarify the concern regarding possible non-compliance with this Convention raised in the inspection request.

Upon the request of the inspection team, the inspected State Party may provide aerial access to the inspection site.  

### 41  

In meeting the requirement to provide access as specified in paragraph 38, the inspected State Party shall be under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of access taking into account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures. The inspected State Party has the right under managed access to take such measures as are necessary to protect national security. The provisions in this paragraph may not be invoked by the inspected State Party to conceal evasion of its obligations not to engage in activities prohibited under this Convention.  

### 42  

If the inspected State Party provides less than full access to places, activities, or information, it shall be under the obligation to make every reasonable effort to provide alternative means to clarify the possible non-compliance concern that generated the challenge inspection.  

### 43  

Upon arrival at the final perimeter of facilities declared pursuant to Articles IV, V and VI, access shall be granted following the pre-inspection briefing and discussion of the inspection plan which shall be limited to the minimum necessary and in any event shall not exceed three hours.

g) In exceptional cases, giving only individual inspectors access to certain parts of the inspection site.    

### 49  

The inspected State Party shall make every reasonable effort to demonstrate to the inspection team that any object, building, structure, container or vehicle to which the inspection team has not had full access, or which has been protected in accordance with paragraph 48, is not used for purposes related to the possible non-compliance concerns raised in the inspection request.  

### 50  

This may be accomplished by means of, *inter alia,* the partial removal of a shroud or environmental protection cover, at the discretion of the inspected State Party, by means of a visual inspection of the interior of an enclosed space from its entrance, or by other methods.  

### 51  

In the case of facilities declared pursuant to Articles IV, V and VI, the following shall apply:

####Annex on the protection of confidential information ("confidentiality Annex")

### A  

####GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

### 1  

The obligation to protect confidential information shall pertain to the verification of both civil and military activities and facilities. Pursuant to the general obligations set forth in Article VIII, the Organization shall: 

a) Require only the minimum amount of information and data necessary for the timely and efficient carrying out of its responsibilities under this Convention;  

b) Take the necessary measures to ensure that inspectors and other staff members of the Technical Secretariat meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity;  

c) Develop agreements and regulations to implement the provisions of this Convention and shall specify as precisely as possible the information to which the Organization shall be given access by a State Party.    

### 2  

The Director-General shall have the primary responsibility for ensuring the protection of confidential information. The Director- General shall establish a stringent regime governing the handling of confidential information by the Technical Secretariat, and in doing so, shall observe the following guidelines: 

a) Information shall be considered confidential if: 

(i) It is so designated by the State Party from which the information was obtained and to which the information refers; or  

(ii) In the judgement of the Director-General, its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the State Party to which it refers or to the mechanisms for implementation of this Convention;    

b) All data and documents obtained by the Technical Secretariat shall be evaluated by the appropriate unit of the Technical Secretariat in order to establish whether they contain confidential information. Data required by States Parties to be assured of the continued compliance with this Convention by other States Parties shall be routinely provided to them. Such data shall encompass: 

(i) The initial and annual reports and declarations provided by States Parties under Articles III, IV, V and VI, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Verification Annex;  

(ii) General reports on the results and effectiveness of verification activities; and  

(iii) Information to be supplied to all States Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Convention;    

c) No information obtained by the Organization in connection with the implementation of this Convention shall be published or otherwise released, except, as follows 

(i) General information on the implementation of this Convention may be compiled and released publicly in accordance with the decisions of the Conference or the Executive Council;  

ii) Any information may be released with the express consent of the State Party to which the information refers;  

(iii) Information classified as confidential shall be released by the Organization only through procedures which ensure that the release of information only occurs in strict conformity with the needs of this Convention. Such procedures shall be considered and approved by the Conference pursuant to Article VIII, paragraph 21 (i);    

d) The level of sensitivity of confidential data or documents shall be established, based on criteria to be applied uniformly in order to ensure their appropriate handling and protection. For this purpose, a classification system shall be introduced, which by taking account of relevant work undertaken in the preparation of this Convention shall provide for clear criteria ensuring the inclusion of information into appropriate categories of confidentiality and the justified durability of the confidential nature of information. While providing for the necessary flexibility in its implementation the classification system shall protect the rights of States Parties providing confidential information. A classification system shall be considered and approved by the Conference pursuant to Article VIII, paragraph 21 (i);  

e) Confidential information shall be stored securely at the premises of the Organization. Some data or documents may also be stored with the National Authority of a State Party. Sensitive information, including, inter alia , photographs, plans and other documents required only for the inspection of a specific facility may be kept under lock and key at this facility;  

f) To the greatest extent consistent with the effective implementation of the verification provisions of this Convention, information shall be handled and stored by the Technical Secretariat in a form that precludes direct identification of the facility to which it pertains;

1.  De bepalingen van dit artikel en de gedetailleerde procedures voor de uitvoering daarvan zijn van toepassing op alle inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens in eigendom of bezit van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag of gelegen op plaatsen onder zijn rechtsmacht of toezicht.   
2.  De gedetailleerde procedures voor de toepassing van dit artikel zijn vervat in de Verificatiebijlage.   
3.  Alle in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens zijn onderworpen aan systematische verificatie door middel van inspectie en controle ter plaatse met behulp van ter plaatse opgestelde instrumenten overeenkomstig Afdeling V van de Verificatiebijlage.   
4.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag beëindigt onmiddellijk alle activiteiten in de in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens, met uitzondering van de voor sluiting vereiste activiteiten.   
5.  Geen enkele Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag bouwt nieuwe inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens of wijzigt bestaande inrichtingen met het oog op de produktie van chemische wapens of andere ingevolge dit Verdrag verboden activiteiten.   
6.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag biedt, onmiddellijk nadat de opgave ingevolge artikel III, eerste lid, letter c, is ingediend, toegang tot de in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens met het oog op systematische verificatie van de opgave door middel van inspectie ter plaatse.   
7.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag: 

a. sluit uiterlijk 90 dagen nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden alle in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens overeenkomstig Afdeling V van de Verificatiebijlage en geeft daarvan kennis; en  

b. biedt na de sluiting toegang tot de in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens, met het oog op systematische verificatie door middel van inspectie ter plaatse en controle met behulp van ter plaatse opgestelde instrumenten, ten einde te waarborgen dat de inrichting gesloten blijft en vervolgens wordt vernietigd.     
8.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag vernietigt alle in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens en bijbehorende inrichtingen en apparatuur ingevolge de Verificatiebijlage en overeenkomstig een overeengekomen tempo en volgorde van vernietiging (hierna te noemen de „volgorde van vernietiging"). Deze vernietiging begint uiterlijk een jaar nadat dit Verdrag voor een Staat in werking is getreden en eindigt uiterlijk 10 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag. Niets belet een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag deze inrichtingen in een sneller tempo te vernietigen.   
9.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag: 

a. dient gedetailleerde plannen in voor de vernietiging van de in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens, zulks uiterlijk 180 dagen voor de vernietiging van elke inrichting begint;

Indien een Staat dit Verdrag bekrachtigt of daartoe toetreedt na de in het achtste lid bedoelde vernietigingsperiode van tien jaar, dient hij de in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens zo spoedig mogelijk te vernietigen. De volgorde van vernietiging en de procedures voor nauwgezette verificatie van een zodanige Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag worden bepaald door de Uitvoerende Raad.   
11.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag kent tijdens de vernietiging van inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens de hoogste prioriteit toe aan het waarborgen van de veiligheid van mensen en aan het beschermen van het milieu. Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag vernietigt inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens overeenkomstig zijn nationale veiligheids- en emissienormen.   
12.  De in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens kunnen tijdelijk worden geconverteerd ten behoeve van de vernietiging van chemische wapens overeenkomstig Afdeling V, paragrafen 18 tot en met 25, van de Verificatiebijlage. Een zodanige geconverteerde inrichting moet worden vernietigd zodra zij niet langer in gebruik is voor de vernietiging van chemische wapens, maar in elk geval uiterlijk 10 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag.   
13.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag kan, wanneer zulks in uitzonderlijke gevallen dringend noodzakelijk is, verzoeken om toestemming om een in het eerste lid bedoelde inrichting voor de produktie van chemische wapens te gebruiken voor ingevolge dit Verdrag niet verboden doeleinden. Op aanbeveling van de Uitvoerende Raad besluit de Conferentie van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag dit verzoek al dan niet goed te keuren en stelt zij de voorwaarden waarvan de goedkeuring afhankelijk is overeenkomstig Afdeling V, Titel D, van de Verificatiebijlage.   
14.  De inrichting voor de produktie van chemische wapens wordt op zodanige wijze geconverteerd, dat de geconverteerde inrichting net zo min kan worden gereconverteerd in een inrichting voor de produktie van chemische wapens als een andere inrichting gebruikt voor onderzoeksdoeleinden, dan wel industriële, agrarische, medische, farmaceutische of andere vreedzame doeleinden waarbij de in Lijst 1 genoemde stoffen niet zijn betrokken.   
15.  Alle geconverteerde inrichtingen zijn onderworpen aan systematische verificatie door middel van inspectie ter plaatse en controle met behulp van ter plaatse opgestelde instrumenten overeenkomstig Afdeling V, Titel D, van de Verificatiebijlage.   
16.  Bij het verrichten van de verificatie-activiteiten ingevolge dit artikel en Afdeling V van de Verificatiebijlage bestudeert de Organisatie maatregelen ter vermijding van onnodige overlapping van bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag inzake de verificatie van inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens en de vernietiging daarvan. Hiertoe besluit de Uitvoerende Raad de verificatie te beperken tot maatregelen die een aanvulling vormen op die welke worden genomen ingevolge een zodanige bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomst indien hij van oordeel is dat: 

a. de verificatiebepalingen van een zodanige overeenkomst in overeenstemming zijn met de verificatiebepalingen van dit artikel en van Afdeling V van de Verificatiebijlage;  

b. de toepassing van de overeenkomst voldoende zekerheid biedt voor de naleving van de desbetreffende bepalingen van dit Verdrag; en  

c. de partijen bij de bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomst de Organisatie volledig op de hoogte houden van hun verificatiewerkzaamheden.     
17.  Indien de Uitvoerende Raad een besluit ingevolge het zestiende lid neemt, heeft de Organisatie het recht toe te zien op de toepassing van de bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomst.   
18.  Het zestiende en zeventiende lid laten de verplichting van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag opgaven te verstrekken ingevolge artikel III, dit artikel en Afdeling V van de Verificatiebijlage, onverlet.   
19.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag draagt de kosten van de vernietiging van de inrichtingen voor de produktie van chemische wapens die hij verplicht is te vernietigen. Hij draagt ook de kosten van de verificatie ingevolge dit artikel, tenzij de Uitvoerende Raad anders besluit. Indien de Uitvoerende Raad besluit de verificatiemaatregelen van de Organisatie te beperken ingevolge het zestiende lid, worden de kosten van de door de Organisatie verrichte aanvullende verificatie en van haar toezicht betaald in overeenstemming met de verdeelsleutel van de Verenigde Naties als aangegeven in artikel VIII, zevende lid.

2.  Alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, zijn lid van de Organisatie. Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag mag het lidmaatschap van de Organisatie niet worden ontnomen.   
3.  De Organisatie heeft haar zetel te 's-Gravenhage, Koninkrijk der Nederlanden.   
4.  Als organen van de Organisatie worden hierbij ingesteld: de Conferentie van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, de Uitvoerende Raad en het Technisch Secretariaat.   
5.  De Organisatie verricht haar verificatie-activiteiten voorzien in dit Verdrag met de geringst mogelijke inmenging die verenigbaar is met de tijdige en efficiënte verwezenlijking van de doelstellingen daarvan. Zij verzoekt alleen om de informatie en gegevens die nodig zijn om zich te kunnen kwijten van haar verantwoordelijkheden ingevolge dit Verdrag. Zij neemt alle voorzorgsmaatregelen om de vertrouwelijkheid te beschermen van informatie inzake civiele en militaire activiteiten en inrichtingen die te harer kennis komt bij de toepassing van dit Verdrag en houdt zich met name aan de bepalingen vervat in de Vertrouwelijkheidsbijlage.   
6.  Bij het verrichten van haar verificatie-activiteiten overweegt de Organisatie maatregelen om gebruik te kunnen maken van de vooruitgang in wetenschap en technologie.   
7.  De kosten van de werkzaamheden van de Organisatie worden betaald door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag overeenkomstig de verdeelsleutel van de Verenigde Naties, aangepast om rekening te houden met het verschil in het aantal leden tussen de Verenigde Naties en deze Organisatie en met inachtneming van de bepalingen van de artikelen IV en V. De financiële bijdragen van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag aan de Voorbereidende Commissie worden op passende wijze in mindering gebracht op hun bijdragen aan de gewone begroting. De begroting van de Organisatie omvat twee hoofdstukken, het ene betreffende de administratieve en overige kosten en het andere betreffende de kosten van verificatie.   
8.  Een lid van de Organisatie dat een achterstand heeft in de betaling van zijn financiële bijdrage aan de Organisatie heeft geen stem in de Organisatie indien het achterstallige bedrag gelijk is aan of groter is dan het bedrag van de bijdrage die het lid verschuldigd is over de voorgaande twee volle jaren. De Conferentie van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag kan zulk een lid niettemin toestaan zijn stem uit te brengen indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het niet betalen te wijten is aan omstandigheden waarop het lid geen invloed heeft.  
###B. DE CONFERENTIE VAN DE STATEN DIE PARTIJ ZIJN BIJ DIT VERDRAG

### *Samenstelling, procedures en besluitvorming* 

9.  De Conferentie van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag (hierna te noemen „de Conferentie") bestaat uit alle leden van deze Organisatie. Elk lid heeft één vertegenwoordiger in de Conferentie, die kan worden vergezeld door plaatsvervangers en adviseurs.

31.  De Uitvoerende Raad bevordert de doeltreffende toepassing en de naleving van dit Verdrag. Hij houdt toezicht op de werkzaamheden van het Technisch Secretariaat, werkt samen met de Nationale Autoriteit van elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag en vergemakkelijkt, op hun verzoek, het overleg en de samenwerking tussen de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag.

Tegelijkertijd stelt hij alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag van deze stap in kennis.  
###D. HET TECHNISCH SECRETARIAAT

37.  Het Technisch Secretariaat staat de Conferentie en de Uitvoerende Raad bij in de uitoefening van hun taken. Het Technisch Secretariaat voert de in dit Verdrag bepaalde verificatiemaatregelen uit. Het verricht de andere hem ingevolge dit Verdrag opgedragen taken alsook de taken die door de Conferentie en de Uitvoerende Raad aan hem zijn overgedragen.   
38.  Het Technisch Secretariaat: 

a. stelt het ontwerp-programma en de ontwerp-begroting van de Organisatie op en legt deze voor aan de Uitvoerende Raad;  

b. stelt het ontwerp-verslag van de Organisatie inzake de toepassing van dit Verdrag en de andere verslagen waarom de Conferentie of de Uitvoerende Raad verzoekt, op en legt deze voor aan de Uitvoerende Raad;  

c. voorziet in de administratieve en technische ondersteuning van de Conferentie, de Uitvoerende Raad en ondergeschikte organen;  

d. verzendt en ontvangt namens de Organisatie mededelingen aan en van Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag inzake aangelegenheden betreffende de toepassing van dit Verdrag;  

e. zorgt voor technische bijstand en technische evaluatie ten behoeve van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag bij de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, met inbegrip van de evaluatie van wel en niet in de Lijsten opgenomen stoffen.     
39.  Het Technisch Secretariaat: 

a. onderhandelt over overeenkomsten of regelingen betreffende de verrichting van verificatie-activiteiten met Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, zulks na goedkeuring door de Uitvoerende Raad;  

b. coördineert uiterlijk 180 dagen na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag de vorming en instandhouding van permanente voorraden voor de verlening van noodhulp en humanitaire hulp door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag overeenkomstig artikel X, zevende lid, letters b en c. Het Technisch Secretariaat kan de opgeslagen goederen controleren op bruikbaarheid. De lijsten van de in voorraad te houden goederen worden bestudeerd en goedgekeurd door de Conferentie ingevolge lid 21, letter i;  

c. beheert het in artikel X bedoelde vrijwillige fonds, verzamelt de door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag verstrekte opgaven en registreert, op verzoek, de voor de toepassing van artikel X tussen Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag of tussen een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag en de Organisatie gesloten bilaterale overeenkomsten.     
40.  Het Technisch Secretariaat stelt de Uitvoerende Raad in kennis van problemen die zich voordoen met betrekking tot de vervulling van zijn taken, met inbegrip van twijfels, dubbelzinnigheden of onduidelijkheden over de naleving van dit Verdrag die te zijner kennis zijn gekomen bij het verrichten van zijn verificatie-activiteiten en die het niet door middel van overleg met de betrokken Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft kunnen oplossen of ophelderen.   
41.  Het Technisch Secretariaat bestaat uit een Directeur-Generaal, die het hoofd en de hoogste bestuursfunctionaris is, inspecteurs en het vereiste wetenschappelijke, technische en overige personeel.   
42.  De Inspectie is een eenheid binnen het Technisch Secretariaat en handelt onder toezicht van de Directeur-Generaal.   
43.  De Directeur-Generaal wordt op aanbeveling van de Uitvoerende Raad door de Conferentie benoemd voor een termijn van vier jaar, die slechts eenmaal kan worden verlengd.   
44.  De Directeur-Generaal is verantwoording verschuldigd jegens de Conferentie en de Uitvoerende Raad voor de aanstelling van het personeel en voor de organisatie en het functioneren van het Technisch Secretariaat. De voornaamste overweging bij de werving van het personeel en de bepaling van de arbeidsvoorwaarden is de noodzaak te voldoen aan de hoogste normen voor efficiëntie, bekwaamheid en integriteit. Alleen onderdanen van Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag kunnen een functie bekleden als Directeur-Generaal, inspecteur of lid van het technische/wetenschappelijke en administratieve personeel. Er dient naar behoren aandacht te worden besteed aan het belang van een zo ruim mogelijke geografische spreiding bij de werving van personeel. Het leidende beginsel bij de werving van personeel is dat het personeelsbestand dient te worden beperkt tot het minimum dat noodzakelijk is voor de goede vervulling van de taken van het Technisch Secretariaat.   
45.  De Directeur-Generaal is verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie en het functioneren van de Wetenschappelijke Adviesraad bedoeld in lid 21, letter h. De Directeur-Generaal benoemt in overleg met de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag de leden van de Wetenschappelijke Adviesraad, die op persoonlijke titel daarin zitting hebben. De leden van de Raad worden benoemd op basis van hun deskundigheid op de terreinen van wetenschap die relevant zijn voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag. De Directeur-Generaal kan tevens, indien passend, in overleg met leden van de Raad tijdelijke werkgroepen van wetenschappelijke deskundigen instellen die aanbevelingen over specifieke kwesties kunnen uitbrengen. In dit verband kunnen de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag lijsten van deskundigen aan de Directeur-Generaal voorleggen.   
46.  Bij de uitoefening van hun taken vragen noch ontvangen de Directeur-Generaal, de inspecteurs en de andere leden van het personeel instructies van een Regering of van andere instanties buiten de Organisatie. Zij onthouden zich van elk optreden dat afbreuk zou kunnen doen aan hun positie als internationale ambtenaren die alleen aan de Conferentie en de Uitvoerende Raad verantwoording verschuldigd zijn.   
47.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag eerbiedigt de uitsluitend internationale aard van de verantwoordelijkheden van de Directeur-Generaal, de inspecteurs en andere leden van het personeel en poogt niet dezen te beïnvloeden in de vervulling van hun taken.  
###E. VOORRECHTEN EN IMMUNITEITEN

48.  De Organisatie geniet op het grondgebied en op alle andere plaatsen onder de rechtsmacht of het toezicht van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag de rechtsbevoegdheid en de voorrechten en immuniteiten die vereist zijn voor de uitoefening van haar taken.   
49.  De afgevaardigden van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag alsmede hun plaatsvervangers en adviseurs, de in de Uitvoerende Raad benoemde vertegenwoordigers alsmede hun plaatsvervangers en adviseurs, de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel van de Organisatie genieten de voorrechten en immuniteiten die vereist zijn voor de onafhankelijke uitoefening van hun taken in verband met de Organisatie.   
50.  De rechtsbevoegdheid, de voorrechten en de immuniteiten bedoeld in dit artikel worden omschreven in overeenkomsten tussen de Organisatie en de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag alsook in een overeenkomst tussen de Organisatie en de Staat waar de Organisatie haar zetel heeft. Deze overeenkomsten worden door de Conferentie bestudeerd en goedgekeurd ingevolge lid 21, letter i.   
51.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in de leden 48 en 49 genieten de Directeur-Generaal en het personeel van het Technisch Secretariaat bij het verrichten van verificatie-activiteiten de voorrechten en immuniteiten die zijn vervat in Afdeling II, Titel B, van de Verificatiebijlage.   

### Artikel  IX  

####Overleg, samenwerking en vaststelling van de feiten

1.  De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag plegen overleg en werken samen, rechtstreeks onderling dan wel via de Organisatie of door middel van andere passende internationale procedures, met inbegrip van procedures in het kader van de Verenigde Naties en in overeenstemming met het Handvest, met betrekking tot aangelegenheden die ter tafel worden gebracht betreffende voorwerp en doel of de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.   
2.  Onverminderd het recht van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag om te verzoeken om een uitdagingsinspectie, dienen de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, wanneer mogelijk, eerst alles in het werk te stellen om een aangelegenheid die twijfel kan doen rijzen omtrent de naleving van dit Verdrag, of die aanleiding geeft tot bezorgdheid over een daarmee samenhangende aangelegenheid die dubbelzinnig kan worden geacht, op te helderen en op te lossen, door middel van uitwisseling van informatie en onderling overleg. Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag die van een andere Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag een verzoek om opheldering ontvangt betreffende een aangelegenheid die naar de mening van de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag zulk een twijfel of bezorgdheid doet ontstaan, verstrekt de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag zo spoedig mogelijk, doch in elk geval uiterlijk 10 dagen na het verzoek, voldoende informatie om de naar voren gebrachte twijfel of bezorgdheid weg te nemen, tezamen met een toelichting hoe de verstrekte informatie de aangelegenheid oplost. Geen enkele bepaling in dit Verdrag doet afbreuk aan het recht van twee of meer Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag om in onderlinge overeenstemming inspecties of andere procedures tussen henzelf te regelen ter opheldering en oplossing van een aangelegenheid die twijfel kan doen ontstaan omtrent de naleving of aanleiding geeft tot bezorgdheid omtrent een daarmee samenhangende aangelegenheid die dubbelzinnig kan worden geacht. Deze regelingen laten de rechten en plichten van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag ingevolge andere bepalingen van dit Verdrag onverlet.  
### *Procedure voor het verzoeken om opheldering* 

3.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft het recht de Uitvoerende Raad te verzoeken om bijstand bij het ophelderen van een situatie die dubbelzinnig kan worden geacht of die aanleiding geeft tot bezorgdheid over de mogelijke niet-naleving van dit Verdrag door een andere Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag. De Uitvoerende Raad verschaft de passende informatie waarover hij beschikt met betrekking tot een zodanige bezorgdheid.   
4.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft het recht de Uitvoerende Raad te verzoeken opheldering van een andere Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag te verkrijgen omtrent een situatie die dubbelzinnig kan worden geacht of die aanleiding geeft tot bezorgdheid over zijn mogelijke niet-naleving van dit Verdrag. In dat geval is het onderstaande van toepassing: 

a. de Uitvoerende Raad zendt het verzoek om opheldering uiterlijk 24 uur na ontvangst via de Directeur-Generaal toe aan de betrokken Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag;  

b. de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag tot wie het verzoek is gericht, verschaft zo spoedig mogelijk, doch in elk geval uiterlijk 10 dagen na ontvangst van het verzoek, opheldering aan de Uitvoerende Raad;  

c. de Uitvoerende Raad neemt kennis van de opheldering en zendt deze uiterlijk 24 uur na ontvangst toe aan de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag;  

d. indien de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag de opheldering onvoldoende acht, heeft hij het recht de Uitvoerende Raad te verzoeken nadere opheldering te verkrijgen van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag tot wie het verzoek is gericht;  

e. voor de verkrijging van nadere opheldering, verzocht ingevolge letter d, kan de Uitvoerende Raad de Directeur-Generaal verzoeken een groep in te stellen van deskundigen van het Technisch Secretariaat of, indien daarvoor binnen het Technisch Secretariaat geen passend personeel beschikbaar is, deskundigen van elders, om alle beschikbare informatie en gegevens betreffende de tot bezorgdheid aanleiding gevende situatie te onderzoeken. De groep deskundigen legt aan de Uitvoerende Raad een verslag voor inzake haar bevindingen betreffende de feiten;  

f. indien de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag de ingevolge de letters d en e verkregen opheldering onbevredigend acht, heeft hij het recht te verzoeken om een bijzondere vergadering van de Uitvoerende Raad, waaraan de betrokken Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag die geen lid van de Uitvoerende Raad zijn, kunnen deelnemen. Op een zodanige bijzondere vergadering bestudeert de Uitvoerende Raad de aangelegenheid en kan hij de door hem passend geachte maatregelen aanbevelen om de situatie op te lossen.     
5.  Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft ook het recht de Uitvoerende Raad te verzoeken om opheldering van een situatie die dubbelzinnig wordt geacht of aanleiding heeft gegeven tot bezorgdheid omtrent zijn mogelijke niet-naleving van dit Verdrag. De Uitvoerende Raad reageert door passende bijstand te verlenen.   
6.  De Uitvoerende Raad stelt de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag in kennis van de in dit artikel genoemde verzoeken om opheldering.   
7.  Indien de twijfel of bezorgdheid van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag over een mogelijke niet-naleving niet is weggenomen binnen 60 dagen na de indiening van het verzoek om opheldering bij de Uitvoerende Raad, of indien de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag meent dat zijn twijfel dringend bestudering vereist, niettegenstaande zijn recht om te verzoeken om een uitdagingsinspectie, kan hij verzoeken om een bijzondere vergadering van de Conferentie overeenkomstig artikel VIII, twaalfde lid, letter c. Op een zodanige bijzondere vergadering bestudeert de Conferentie de aangelegenheid en kan zij de door haar passend geachte maatregelen aanbevelen om de situatie op te lossen.  
### *Procedures voor uitdagingsinspecties* 

8.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft het recht te verzoeken om een uitdagingsinspectie ter plaatse van inrichtingen of plaatsen op het grondgebied of op een andere plaats onder de rechtsmacht of het toezicht van een andere Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag met als uitsluitend doel vragen betreffende mogelijke niet-naleving van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag op te helderen en op te lossen, en om deze inspectie onverwijld waar dan ook te laten verrichten door een inspectieteam aangewezen door de Directeur-Generaal en overeenkomstig de Verificatiebijlage.   
9.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag is verplicht het verzoek om inspectie binnen de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag te houden en in het verzoek om inspectie alle passende informatie te verstrekken op grond waarvan bezorgdheid is ontstaan betreffende mogelijke niet-naleving van dit Verdrag, zoals genoemd in de Verificatiebijlage. Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag onthoudt zich van ongefundeerde verzoeken om inspectie, ten einde misbruik te vermijden. De uitdagingsinspectie wordt verricht met als uitsluitend doel het vaststellen van de feiten betreffende de mogelijke niet-naleving.   
10.  Voor de verificatie van de naleving van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag staat elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag het Technisch Secretariaat toe de uitdagingsinspectie ter plaatse te verrichten ingevolge het achtste lid.   
11.  Ingevolge een verzoek om een uitdagingsinspectie van een inrichting of plaats en overeenkomstig de in de Verificatiebijlage bepaalde procedures heeft de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag: 

a. het recht en de plicht naar redelijkheid alles in het werk te stellen om zijn naleving van dit Verdrag aan te tonen en hiertoe het inspectieteam in staat te stellen zijn opdracht te vervullen;  

b. de plicht toegang te verlenen tot de plaats waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft met als uitsluitend doel het vaststellen van feiten die van belang zijn voor de bezorgdheid omtrent mogelijke niet-naleving; en  

c. het recht maatregelen te nemen om gevoelige inrichtingen te beschermen en openbaarmaking te voorkomen van vertrouwelijke informatie en gegevens die geen betrekking hebben op dit Verdrag.     
12.  Met betrekking tot een waarnemer is het onderstaande van toepassing: 

a. de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag kan, mits de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag daarmee instemt, een vertegenwoordiger zenden die onderdaan is van hetzij de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, hetzij een derde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, om het verrichten van de uitdagingsinspectie gade te slaan;  

b. de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag verleent de waarnemer dan toegang in overeenstemming met de Verificatiebijlage;  

c. de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag aanvaardt gewoonlijk de voorgestelde waarnemer, maar indien de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag gebruik maakt van zijn recht tot weigering, wordt dit feit vermeld in het eindverslag.     
13.  De verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient een verzoek om een uitdagingsinspectie ter plaatse in bij de Uitvoerende Raad en tegelijkertijd bij de Directeur-Generaal ter onmiddellijke behandeling.   
14.  De Directeur-Generaal vergewist zich er onmiddellijk van of het verzoek om inspectie voldoet aan de eisen neergelegd in Afdeling X, paragraaf 4, van de Verificatiebijlage en staat indien nodig de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag bij met het op de voorgeschreven wijze indienen van het verzoek. Wanneer het verzoek om inspectie aan de eisen voldoet, wordt begonnen met de voorbereiding van de uitdagingsinspectie.   
15.  De Directeur-Generaal zendt het verzoek om inspectie uiterlijk 12 uur vóór de geplande aankomst van het inspectieteam op het punt van binnenkomst toe aan de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag.   
16.  Na ontvangst van het verzoek om inspectie neemt de Uitvoerende Raad kennis van de maatregelen van de Directeur-Generaal naar aanleiding van het verzoek en blijft hij gedurende de inspectieprocedure de zaak volgen. Zijn besprekingen mogen het inspectieproces evenwel niet vertragen.   
17.  De Uitvoerende Raad kan uiterlijk 12 uur na ontvangst van het verzoek om inspectie met een meerderheid van drievierde van alle leden besluiten de uitdagingsinspectie niet te doen verrichten, indien hij van mening is dat het verzoek om inspectie lichtvaardig is of op misbruik berust dan wel duidelijk valt buiten de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag als beschreven in het achtste lid. De verzoekende noch de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag mogen aan een zodanig besluit deelnemen. Indien de Uitvoerende Raad zich tegen de uitdagingsinspectie uitspreekt, worden de voorbereidingen stopgezet, worden geen verdere maatregelen naar aanleiding van het verzoek om inspectie genomen en worden de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag daarvan in kennis gesteld.   
18.  De Directeur-Generaal verstrekt een inspectiemandaat voor het verrichten van de uitdagingsinspectie. Het inspectiemandaat bestaat uit het in het achtste en negende lid bedoelde verzoek om inspectie, verwoord in praktische instructies, en dient overeen te komen met het verzoek om inspectie.   
19.  De uitdagingsinspectie wordt verricht overeenkomstig Afdeling X of, in geval van vermeend gebruik, overeenkomstig Afdeling XI van de Verificatie-bijlage. Het inspectieteam wordt geleid door het beginsel dat de uitdagingsinspectie moet worden verricht op de minst mogelijke hinder veroorzakende wijze, die verenigbaar is met de doeltreffende en tijdige vervulling van zijn opdracht.   
20.  De geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag staat het inspectieteam gedurende de uitdagingsinspectie bij en vergemakkelijkt zijn taak. Indien de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag ingevolge Afdeling X, Titel C, van de Verificatiebijlage in plaats van volledige en alomvattende toegang regelingen voorstelt om de naleving van dit Verdrag aan te tonen, dient hij door middel van overleg met het inspectieteam, naar redelijkheid alles in het werk te stellen om overeenstemming te bereiken omtrent de modaliteiten voor het vaststellen van de feiten met het oog op het aantonen van zijn naleving.   
21.  Het eindverslag dient de feitelijke bevindingen te bevatten, alsmede een beoordeling door het inspectieteam van de mate en aard van de verleende toegang en medewerking ten behoeve van de bevredigende uitvoering van de uitdagingsinspectie. De DirecteurGeneraal zendt het eindverslag van het inspectieteam onverwijld toe aan de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, aan de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, aan de Uitvoerende Raad en aan alle andere Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. Voorts zendt de Directeur-Generaal de beoordelingen van de verzoekende en van de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, alsmede de opvattingen van andere Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, die de Directeur-Generaal hiertoe ter kennis kunnen worden gebracht, onverwijld toe aan de Uitvoerende Raad, en verstrekt deze daarna aan alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag.   
22.  Overeenkomstig zijn bevoegdheden en taken toetst de Uitvoerende Raad het eindverslag van het inspectieteam zodra het is voorgelegd en bespreekt hij de volgende punten: 

a. of er sprake is van niet-naleving;  

b. of het verzoek binnen de werkingssfeer van dit Verdrag is geweest; en  

c. of er misbruik is gemaakt van het recht te verzoeken om een uitdagingsinspectie.     
23.  Indien de Uitvoerende Raad tot de conclusie komt, overeenkomstig zijn bevoegdheden en taken, dat verdere maatregelen nodig kunnen zijn met betrekking tot lid 22, neemt hij passende maatregelen om de situatie recht te zetten en naleving van dit Verdrag te waarborgen, met inbegrip van specifieke aanbevelingen aan de Conferentie. In geval van misbruik onderzoekt de Uitvoerende Raad of de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag al dan niet financiële gevolgen van de uitdagingsinspectie moet dragen.   
24.  De verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag en de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag hebben het recht deel te nemen aan het toetsingsproces. De Uitvoerende Raad stelt de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en de volgende vergadering van de Conferentie in kennis van het resultaat van de toetsing.   
25.  Indien de Uitvoerende Raad specifieke aanbevelingen aan de Conferentie heeft gedaan, overweegt de Conferentie maatregelen overeenkomstig artikel XII.   

### Artikel  X  

####Bijstand en bescherming tegen chemische wapens

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit artikel wordt onder „bijstand" verstaan het coördineren en aan de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag bieden van bescherming tegen chemische wapens, met inbegrip van onder meer het volgende: detectie-apparatuur en alarmsystemen, beschermende uitrusting, ontsmettingsapparatuur en ontsmettingsmiddelen, tegengif en medische behandeling, en advies inzake deze beschermende maatregelen.   
2.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag daardoor wordt belemmerd in de uitoefening van zijn recht onderzoek te verrichten naar middelen tot bescherming tegen chemische wapens, deze te ontwikkelen, te produceren, te verwerven, over te dragen of te gebruiken voor ingevolge dit Verdrag niet verboden doeleinden.   
3.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag verplicht zich ertoe de zo volledig mogelijke uitwisseling van uitrusting, materiaal en wetenschappelijke en technologische informatie betreffende middelen tot bescherming tegen chemische wapens te vergemakkelijken en heeft het recht aan die uitwisseling deel te nemen.   
4.  Ter vergroting van de doorzichtigheid van nationale programma's met betrekking tot bescherming, dient elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag jaarlijks aan het Technisch Secretariaat informatie omtrent zijn programma te verstrekken overeenkomstig procedures die zullen worden bestudeerd en goedgekeurd door de Conferentie ingevolge artikel VIII, lid 21, letter i.   
5.  Uiterlijk 180 dagen na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag zet het Technisch Seceretariaat een gegevensbestand op dat vrij beschikbare informatie bevat betreffende de verschillende middelen tot bescherming tegen chemische wapens, alsmede door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag verstrekte informatie, en houdt dit bij, ten behoeve van Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag die dit willen raadplegen. Het Technisch Secretariaat verstrekt tevens, binnen de grenzen van de hem ter beschikking staande middelen en op verzoek van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, deskundig advies en helpt de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag na te gaan hoe zijn programma's voor de ontwikkeling en verbetering van een vermogen tot bescherming tegen chemische wapens zouden kunnen worden uitgevoerd.   
6.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit Verdrag mag zo worden uitgelegd dat de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag daardoor worden belemmerd in de uitoefening van hun recht bilateraal om bijstand te verzoeken en deze te verlenen, en afzonderlijke overeenkomsten te sluiten met andere Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag betreffende het verkrijgen van bijstand in noodgevallen.   
7.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag verplicht zich tot het verlenen van bijstand via de Organisatie en hiertoe naar keuze een of meer van de onderstaande maatregelen te nemen: 

a. het verstrekken van een bijdrage aan het vrijwillige bijstandsfonds dat tijdens haar eerste vergadering door de Conferentie zal worden ingesteld;  

b. het sluiten, indien mogelijk uiterlijk 180 dagen nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden, van overeenkomsten met de Organisatie betreffende het op verzoek leveren van bijstand;  

c. het doen van een opgave, uiterlijk 180 dagen nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden, van de soort bijstand die hij zou kunnen verlenen als de Organisatie daartoe een oproep doet. Indien een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag echter vervolgens niet in staat is de in zijn opgave beoogde bijstand te verlenen, is hij nog altijd verplicht bijstand overeenkomstig dit lid te verlenen.     
8.  Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag heeft het recht te verzoeken om bijstand en bescherming tegen het gebruik of de dreiging met gebruik van chemische wapens en, met inachtneming van de procedures vervat in het negende, tiende en elfde lid deze te ontvangen, indien hij van oordeel is dat: 

a. ertegen hem chemische wapens zijn gebruikt;  

b. oproerbestrijdingsmiddelen tegen hem zijn gebruikt als een vorm van oorlogvoering;  

c. hij wordt bedreigd met optreden of activiteiten van een Staat die in artikel I aan de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag zijn verboden.     
9.  Het verzoek, gestaafd door relevante informatie, dient te worden ingediend bij de Directeur-Generaal, die het onmiddellijk doorzendt naar de Uitvoerende Raad en naar alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. De Directeur-Generaal zendt het verzoek onmiddellijk door naar de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag die overeenkomstig het zevende lid, letters b en c, hebben aangeboden uiterlijk 12 uur na ontvangst van het verzoek aan de betrokken Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag noodhulp te zenden in geval van gebruik van chemische wapens of gebruik van oproerbestrijdingsmiddelen als een vorm van oorlogvoering, of humanitaire bijstand in geval van ernstige dreiging met het gebruik van chemische wapens of ernstige dreiging met gebruik van oproerbestrijdingsmiddelen als een vorm van oorlogvoering. De Directeur-Generaal stelt uiterlijk 24 uur na ontvangst van het verzoek een onderzoek in op grond waarvan verdere maatregelen kunnen worden genomen. Hij dient het onderzoek binnen 72 uur te voltooien en een verslag toe te zenden aan de Uitvoerende Raad. Indien er meer tijd nodig is om het onderzoek af te ronden, dient binnen de genoemde termijn een tussentijds verslag te worden ingediend. De benodigde extra tijd voor het onderzoek mag niet meer zijn dan 72 uur. Deze termijn kan evenwel worden verlengd met perioden van dezelfde duur. Aan het einde van elke periode van verlenging dient een verslag bij de Uitvoerende Raad te worden ingediend. Het onderzoek dient, indien passend en overeenkomstig het verzoek en de bij het verzoek gevoegde informatie, relevante feiten vast te stellen die betrekking hebben op het verzoek, alsmede de soort en de omvang van de vereiste aanvullende bijstand en bescherming aan te geven.   
10.  De Uitvoerende Raad komt uiterlijk 24 uur na ontvangst van een onderzoeksverslag bijeen om de situatie te bestuderen en besluit binnen de daaropvolgende 24 uur met eenvoudige meerderheid of het Technisch Secretariaat moet worden opgedragen de aanvullende bijstand te verlenen. Het Technisch Secretariaat zendt het onderzoeksverslag en het door de Uitvoerende Raad genomen besluit onmiddellijk toe aan alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en de desbetreffende internationale organisaties. Wanneer de Uitvoerende Raad daartoe besluit, verleent de Directeur-Generaal onmiddellijk bijstand. Hiertoe kan de Directeur-Generaal samenwerken met de verzoekende Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, met andere Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag en met de desbetreffende internationale organisaties. De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag dienen al het mogelijke in het werk te stellen om de bijstand te verlenen.   
11.  Indien de beschikbare informatie uit het lopende onderzoek of uit andere betrouwbare bronnen voldoende bewijs zou opleveren dat er slachtoffers zijn van het gebruik van chemische wapens en onmiddellijke maatregelen geboden zijn, stelt de Directeur-Generaal alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag daarvan in kennis en neemt hij maatregelen voor noodhulp met gebruikmaking van de middelen die de Conferentie hem voor zulke omstandigheden ter beschikking heeft gesteld. De Directeur-Generaal houdt de Uitvoerende Raad op de hoogte van op grond van dit lid genomen maatregelen.

### C  

####VERNIETIGING

#### *Beginselen voor en wijzen van vernietiging van chemische wapens* 

### 12  

Onder „vernietiging van chemische wapens" wordt verstaan een proces waarin stoffen op een in wezen onomkeerbare wijze worden omgezet in een vorm die niet geschikt is voor de produktie van chemische wapens en waardoor munitie en andere andere inzetmiddelen op onomkeerbare wijze als zodanig onbruikbaar worden gemaakt.  

### 13  

Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient te bepalen hoe hij chemische wapens zal vernietigen, met dien verstande dat zulks niet op de volgende wijzen mag geschieden: storten in enig oppervlaktewater, begraven in de bodem of open verbranding. Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient chemische wapens uitsluitend te vernietigen in speciaal daartoe aangewezen en deugdelijk ontworpen en uitgeruste inrichtingen.  

### 14  

Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient erop toe te zien dat zijn inrichtingen voor de vernietiging van chemische wapens worden gebouwd en werken op een wijze die de vernietiging van chemische wapens waarborgt, en dat het vernietigingsproces kan worden geverifieerd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van dit Verdrag.  

#### *Volgorde van de vernietiging* 

### 15  

De volgorde van de vernietiging van chemische wapens is gebaseerd op de verplichtingen als genoemd in artikel I en de andere artikelen, waaronder verplichtingen met betrekking tot systematische verificatie ter plaatse. Daarbij wordt rekening gehouden met het belang dat Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag hebben bij onverminderde veiligheid gedurende de vernietigingsperiode, het wekken van vertrouwen in het eerste deel van de vernietigingsfase, het geleidelijk opdoen van ervaring in de loop van de vernietiging van chemische wapens, en de toepasbaarheid, ongeacht de feitelijke samenstelling van de voorraden en de gekozen wijzen van vernietiging van de chemische wapens. De volgorde van de vernietiging is gebaseerd op het beginsel van gelijkmatig afbouwen.  

### 16  

Met het oog op de vernietiging worden de door elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag opgegeven chemische wapens verdeeld in drie categorieën:  

|
|
| Categorie 1:  | Chemische wapens op basis van de in Lijst 1 genoemde stoffen en onderdelen dan wel bestanddelen daarvan;  |
| Categorie 2:  | Chemische wapens op basis van alle andere stoffen en onderdelen dan wel bestanddelen daarvan;  |
| Categorie 3:  | Ongevulde munitie en andere inzetmiddelen, en uitrusting die specifiek is ontworpen voor rechtstreeks met de aanwending van chemische wapens verband houdend gebruik.  |

### 17  

Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient: 

a. met de vernietiging van de chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te beginnen uiterlijk twee jaar nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden en dient de vernietiging uiterlijk tien jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag te hebben voltooid. Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient de chemische wapens te vernietigen in overeenstemming met de volgende tijdslimieten: 

i. Fase 1: Uiterlijk twee jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag dient de beproeving van zijn eerste vernietigingsinrichting te zijn voltooid. Uiterlijk drie jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag dient ten minste 1 procent van de chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te zijn vernietigd;  

ii. Fase 2: Uiterlij k vij f jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag dient ten minste 20 procent van de chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te zijn vernietigd;  

iii. Fase 3: Uiterlijk zeven jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag dient ten minste 45 procent van de chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te zijn vernietigd;  

iv. Fase 4: Uiterlijk tien jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag dienen alle chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te zijn vernietigd.    

b. met de vernietiging van de chemische wapens van Categorie 2 te beginnen uiterlijk één jaar nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden en dient de vernietiging uiterlijk vijfjaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag te hebben voltooid. De chemische wapens van Categorie 2 dienen in gelijke, over de gehele vernietigingsperiode verspreide, jaarlijkse hoeveelheden te worden vernietigd. De vergelijkingsfactor voor deze wapens is het gewicht van de stoffen in Categorie 2; en  

c. met de vernietiging van in chemische wapens in Categorie 3 te beginnen uiterlijk één jaar nadat dit Verdrag voor die Staat in werking is getreden en dient de vernietiging uiterlijk vijf jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag te hebben voltooid. De chemische wapens van Categorie 3 dienen in gelijke, over de gehele vernietigingsperiode verspreide, jaarlijkse hoeveelheden te worden vernietigd. De vergelijkingsfactor bij ongevulde munitie en andere inzetmiddelen wordt uitgedrukt in het nominale volume van de lading (m <sup>3</sup>) en bij uitrusting in het aantal exemplaren.    

### 18  

Voor de vernietiging van binaire chemische wapens geldt het volgende: 

a. met het oog op de volgorde van de vernietiging, wordt een opgegeven hoeveelheid (in tonnen) van het hoofdbestanddeel dat is bedoeld voor een bepaald toxisch eindprodukt geacht gelijk te zijn aan de hoeveelheid (in tonnen) van dit eindprodukt die op stoichiometrische wijze is berekend, uitgaande van een rendement van 100%;  

b. de verplichting om een bepaalde hoeveelheid van het hoofdbestanddeel te vernietigen brengt de verplichting met zich mede om een overeenkomstige hoeveelheid van het andere bestanddeel te vernietigen, berekend op basis van de feitelijke gewichtsverhouding van de bestanddelen van het desbetreffende type binaire chemische munitie/ andere inzetmiddelen.  

c. indien van het andere bestanddeel meer is opgegeven dan benodigd is, gebaseerd op de feitelijke gewichtsverhouding tussen de bestanddelen, wordt het overschot vernietigd in de eerste twee jaar na het begin van de vernietigingsactiviteiten;  

d. aan het einde van elk daarop volgend jaar waarin wordt vernietigd, mag een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag een hoeveelheid van het andere opgegeven bestanddeel behouden, welke wordt bepaald op basis van de feitelijke gewichtsverhouding van de bestanddelen van het desbetreffende type binaire chemische munitie/andere inzetmiddelen.    

### 19  

Voor chemische wapens met verscheidene bestanddelen is de volgorde van de vernietiging analoog aan die welke is voorzien voor binaire chemische wapens.  

#### *Wijziging van tussentijdse tijdslimieten* 

### 20  

De Uitvoerende Raad bestudeert de algemene plannen voor de vernietiging van chemische wapens, ingediend ingevolge artikel III, eerste lid, letter a, onder v, en in overeenstemming met paragraaf 6, onder andere om te beoordelen of deze in overeenstemming zijn met de volgorde van de vernietiging als genoemd in de paragrafen 15 tot en met 19. De Uitvoerende Raad pleegt overleg met elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag waarvan het plan niet in overeenstemming is, ten einde het plan in overeenstemming te brengen.  

### 21  

Indien een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag wegens bijzondere omstandigheden waarop hij geen invloed heeft, meent dat hij het vernietigingsniveau, genoemd voor Fase 1, 2 of 3 in de volgorde van de vernietiging van chemische wapens van Categorie 1, niet kan bereiken, kan hij wijzigingen in die tijdslimieten voorstellen. Dit voorstel dient uiterlijk 120 dagen na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag te worden gedaan en dient een gedetailleerde verklaring van de redenen voor het voorstel te omvatten.  

### 22  

Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient alle noodzakelijke maatregelen te nemen om zorg te dragen voor de vernietiging van de chemische wapens van Categorie 1 in overeenstemming met de in paragraaf 17, letter a, genoemde tijdslimieten voor de vernietiging, zoals gewijzigd ingevolge paragraaf 21. Indien een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag evenwel van oordeel is dat hij niet in staat is zorg te dragen voor de vernietiging van het percentage chemische wapens van Categorie 1 dat bij een tussentijdse tijdslimiet is vereist, kan hij de Uitvoerende Raad verzoeken de Conferentie aan te bevelen een verlenging van de desbetreffende termijn toe te staan. Dit verzoek dient ten minste 180 dagen voor de tussentijdse tijdslimiet te worden gedaan en dient een gedetailleerde verklaring van de redenen voor het verzoek te omvatten, te zamen met de plannen van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag om ervoor te zorgen dat hij wel in staat is te voldoen aan de eerstvolgende tussentijdse tijdslimiet.  

### 23  

Indien een verlenging wordt toegestaan, is een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag nog altijd verplicht te voldoen aan de cumulatieve vereisten ter zake van de vernietiging die zijn bepaald voor de eerstvolgende tijdslimiet. Verlengingen ingevolge deze Titel houden geenszins een wijziging in van de verplichting van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag om binnen ten hoogste 10 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag alle chemische wapens van Categorie 1 te vernietigen.  

#### *Verlenging van de termijn voor de voltooiing van de vernietiging* 

### 24  

Indien een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag meent dat hij niet in staat is zorg te dragen voor de vernietiging van alle chemische wapens van Categorie 1 binnen ten hoogste 10 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag, kan hij bij de Uitvoerende Raad een verzoek om verlenging van de termijn voor de voltooiing van de vernietiging van die chemische wapens indienen. Dit verzoek dient uiterlijk negen jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag te worden gedaan.

### 26  

Een besluit inzake het verzoek wordt door de Conferentie genomen op haar eerstvolgende vergadering, op grond van de aanbeveling van de Uitvoerende Raad. Een verlenging dient tot het noodzakelijke minimum beperkt te blijven, doch de termijn waarbinnen een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag zijn vernietiging van alle chemische wapens moet voltooien, mag in geen geval worden verlengd tot een tijdstip dat later valt dan 15 jaar na de inwerkingtreding van dit Verdrag. De Uitvoerende Raad stelt voorwaarden voor het toestaan van de verlenging vast, met inbegrip van de specifieke verificatiemaatregelen die noodzakelijk worden geacht, alsmede specifieke stappen die de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient te ondernemen om problemen in zijn vernietigingsprogramma te verhelpen. De kosten van de verificatie gedurende de verlengingsperiode worden verdeeld in overeenstemming met artikel IV, zestiende lid.  

### 27  

Indien een verlenging wordt toegestaan, dient de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag passende maatregelen te nemen om aan alle volgende tijdslimieten te voldoen.

### D  

####VERIFICATIE

#### *Verificatie van de opgaven van chemische wapens door middel van inspectie ter plaatse* 

### 37  

De verificatie van de opgaven van chemische wapens heeft tot doel de juistheid van de desbetreffende ingevolge artikel III overgelegde opgaven te bevestigen door middel van inspectie ter plaatse.  

### 38  

De inspecteurs verrichten deze verificatie onmiddellijk nadat een opgave is ingediend. Zij verifiëren, onder meer, de hoeveelheid en de aard van de stoffen en het type en aantal van de munitie, andere inzetmiddelen en andere uitrusting.  

### 39  

De inspecteurs mogen, indien van toepassing, overeengekomen zegels, markeringsmiddelen of andere procedures voor de controle van een inventaris gebruiken ter vergemakkelijking van een nauwkeurige inventarisatie van de chemische wapens in elke opslaginrichting.  

### 40  

Naar gelang de inventarisatie vordert, mogen de inspecteurs de overeengekomen zegels aanbrengen die nodig zijn om duidelijk aan te geven of er voorraden zijn verwijderd en te verzekeren dat de opslaginrichting gedurende de inventarisatie afgesloten is. Na afloop van de inventarisatie dienen deze zegels te worden verwijderd, tenzij anders is overeengekomen.  

#### *Systematische verificatie van de opslaginrichtingen* 

### 41  

De systematische verificatie van de opslaginrichtingen heeft tot doel te verzekeren dat er geen chemische wapens uit die inrichtingen worden verwijderd zonder dat zulks wordt opgemerkt.  

### 42  

De systematische verificatie dient zo spoedig mogelijk nadat de opgave van chemische wapens is ingediend aanvang te nemen en voort te duren totdat alle chemische wapens uit de opslaginrichting zijn verwijderd. Zij dient in overeenstemming te zijn met het inrichtingsakkoord en dient de inspectie ter plaatse en de controle met behulp van ter plaatse opgestelde instrumenten te combineren.  

### 43  

Wanneer alle chemische wapens uit de opslaginrichting zijn verwijderd, bevestigt het Technisch Secretariaat de daartoe strekkende verklaring van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag. Na deze bevestiging beëindigt het Technisch Secretariaat de systematische verificatie van de opslaginrichting en verwijdert het onmiddellijk alle door de inspecteurs opgestelde controle-instrumenten.  

#### *Inspecties en bezoeken* 

### 44  

De bepaalde opslaginrichting die zal worden geïnspecteerd, wordt op zodanige wijze door het Technisch Secretariaat gekozen, dat het onmogelijk is te voorspellen wanneer precies de inrichting zal worden geïnspecteerd. De richtlijnen voor de vaststelling van de frequentie van systematische inspecties zullen worden uitgewerkt door het Technisch Secretariaat, rekening houdend met de aanbevelingen die zullen worden bestudeerd en goedgekeurd door de Conferentie overeenkomstig artikel VIII, lid 21, letter i.  

### 45  

Het Technisch Secretariaat stelt de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag in kennis van zijn besluit om de opslaginrichting te inspecteren of te bezoeken, zulks 48 uur vóór de geplande aankomst van het inspectieteam bij de inrichting voor systematische inspecties of bezoeken.

### 24  

In het verslag inzake de toestand dient de eventuele dringende behoefte aan bijstand en alle andere informatie te worden vermeld. In de voortgangsrapportage dient melding te worden gemaakt van alle verdere behoefte aan bijstand die aan het licht treedt in de loop van het onderzoek.  

### 25  

Het eindverslag dient een overzicht te geven van de concrete bevindingen van de inspectie, in het bijzonder met betrekking tot het vermeende gebruik als genoemd in het verzoek. Bovendien dient een verslag van een onderzoek naar een vermeend gebruik een beschrijving van het onderzoeksproces te omvatten, waarin de verschillende fasen worden doorlopen, onder vermelding van met name: 

a. de plaatsen en tijdstippen van de monsterneming en analysering ter plaatse; en  

b. bewijsmateriaal, zoals verslagen van vraaggesprekken, de resultaten van medische onderzoeken en wetenschappelijke analyses en door het inspectieteam bestudeerde stukken.    

### 26  

Indien het inspectieteam, onder andere door het aantreffen van onzuiverheden en andere stoffen tijdens de laboratoriumanalyse van de genomen monsters, in de loop van het onderzoek informatie verzamelt die kan bijdragen tot het opsporen van de herkomst van eventueel gebruikte chemische wapens, dient die informatie in het verslag te worden opgenomen.  

### E  

####STATEN DIE GEEN PARTIJ ZIJN BIJ DIT VERDRAG

### 27  

In geval van vermeend gebruik van chemische wapens dat een Staat betreft die geen Partij is bij dit Verdrag, dan wel een grondgebied dat niet onder het toezicht van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag valt, werkt de Organisatie nauw samen met de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties. Indien daarom wordt verzocht, stelt de Organisatie haar middelen ter beschikking van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties.

### A  

####ALGEMENE BEGINSELEN VOOR HET OMGAAN MET VERTROUWELIJKE INFORMATIE

### 1  

De verplichting tot het beschermen van vertrouwelijke informatie geldt voor de verificatie van zowel civiele als militaire activiteiten en inrichtingen. Ingevolge de in artikel VIII uiteengezette algemene verplichtingen zal de Organisatie: 

a. slechts het minimum aan informatie en gegevens verlangen die zij nodig heeft voor de tijdige en doelmatige uitvoering van haar verantwoordelijkheden krachtens dit Verdrag;  

b. de nodige maatregelen nemen om te verzekeren dat inspecteurs en overige medewerkers van het Technisch Secretariaat voldoen aan de hoogste normen wat betreft doelmatigheid, bekwaamheid en integriteit;  

c. overeenkomsten en regelingen ontwikkelen voor de toepassing van de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, en zo nauwkeurig mogelijk de informatie omschrijven waartoe aan de Organisatie toegang wordt verleend door een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag.    

### 2  

De Directeur-Generaal draagt de hoogste verantwoordelijkheid voor het verzekeren van de bescherming van vertrouwelijke informatie. De Directeur-Generaal stelt strenge regels vast voor het omgaan met vertrouwelijke informatie door het Technisch Secretariaat, en neemt daarbij de volgende richtlijnen in acht: 

a. Informatie wordt als vertrouwelijk beschouwd indien: 

i. die informatie als zodanig bestempeld is door de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag waarvan zij werd verkregen en waarop zij betrekking heeft;  

ii. naar het oordeel van de Directeur-Generaal redelijkerwijs kan worden verwacht dat de ongeoorloofde onthulling van die informatie schade zou toebrengen aan de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag waarop zij betrekking heeft, of aan de mechanismen voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag.    

b. Alle door het Technisch Secretariaat verkregen gegevens en documenten worden door het desbetreffende onderdeel van het Technisch Secretariaat nagezien op de aanwezigheid daarin van vertrouwelijke informatie. De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag worden geregeld voorzien van de gegevens die zij nodig hebben om zich te verzekeren van de naleving van dit Verdrag door de andere Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag. Deze gegevens omvatten: 

i. de eerste en jaarlijkse verslagen en opgaven die door de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag worden verstrekt ingevolge de artikelen III, IV, V en VI, in overeenstemming met de in de Verificatiebijlage uiteengezette bepalingen;  

ii. algemene verslagen inzake de resultaten en de doeltreffendheid van verificatie-activiteiten; en  

iii. informatie die dient te worden verstrekt aan alle Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag;    

c. Informatie die door de Organisatie wordt verkregen in verband met de toepassing van dit Verdrag mag niet worden gepubliceerd of op andere wijze worden vrijgegeven, behalve als volgt: 

i. Algemene informatie over de toepassing van dit Verdrag kan worden gebundeld en openbaar worden gemaakt in overeenstemming met de besluiten van de Conferentie of de Uitvoerende Raad;  

ii. Informatie kan worden vrijgegeven met de uitdrukkelijke instemming van de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag waarop die informatie betrekking heeft;  

iii. Informatie die als vertrouwelijk is gerubriceerd, wordt door de Organisatie uitsluitend vrijgegeven volgens procedures die verzekeren dat het vrijgeven van de informatie alleen geschiedt in strikte overeenstemming met hetgeen voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag noodzakelijk is. Deze procedures zullen worden bestudeerd en goedgekeurd door de Conferentie ingevolge Artikel VIII, lid 21, letter i;    

d Het niveau van gevoeligheid van vertrouwelijke gegevens of documenten wordt vastgesteld op basis van criteria die eenvormig dienen te worden toegepast opdat passende behandeling en bescherming ervan wordt verzekerd. Hiertoe wordt een rubriceringssysteem ingevoerd dat, voortbouwend op het desbetreffende werk dat tijdens de voorbereiding van dit Verdrag is aangevangen, voorziet in duidelijke criteria die moeten verzekeren dat de informatie in passende vertrouwelijkheidsklassen wordt ingedeeld en dat het vertrouwelijke karakter van die informatie behouden blijft zolang dit gerechtvaardigd is. Het rubriceringssysteem moet enerzijds met de nodige flexibiliteit worden toegepast en anderzijds de rechten beschermen van de Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag die vertrouwelijke informatie verstrekken. Een rubriceringssysteem zal worden bestudeerd en goedgekeurd door de Conferentie ingevolge artikel VIII, lid 21, letter i;  

e. Vertrouwelijke informatie wordt op veilige wijze opgeslagen in het kantoor van de Organisatie. Sommige gegevens of documenten kunnen ook worden opgeslagen bij de Nationale Autoriteit van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag. Gevoelige informatie, met inbegrip van onder andere foto's, plattegronden en andere documenten die slechts vereist zijn voor de inspectie van een bepaalde inrichting, kan achter slot en grendel in die inrichting worden bewaard;  

f. Voor zover niet strijdig met de doeltreffende toepassing van de verificatiebepalingen van dit Verdrag wordt informatie door het Technisch Secretariaat behandeld en opgeslagen in een zodanige vorm dat het niet mogelijk is de inrichting waarop de informatie betrekking heeft, onmiddellijk te herkennen;  

g. De hoeveelheid vertrouwelijke informatie die uit een inrichting wordt meegenomen wordt beperkt tot het minimum dat noodzakeljk is voor de tijdige en doeltreffende toepassing van de verificatiebepalingen van dit Verdrag; en  

h. De toegang tot vertrouwelijke informatie wordt geregeld in overeenstemming met de rubricering ervan. De verspreiding van vertrouwelijke informatie binnen de Organisatie geschiedt strikt op basis van de noodzaak van kennisneming ervan.    

### 3  

De Directeur-Generaal brengt jaarlijks verslag uit aan de Conferentie over de uitvoering van alle regelingen voor de wijze waarop het Technisch Secretariaat omgaat met vertrouwelijke informatie.  

### 4  

Elke Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag dient de informatie die hij van de Organisatie ontvangt te behandelen overeenkomstig het voor die informatie vastgestelde niveau van vertrouwelijkheid. Op verzoek dient een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag bijzonderheden te verstrekken over de wijze waarop wordt omgegaan met de door de Organisatie aan die Staat verstrekte informatie.  

### B  

####AANSTELLING EN HANDELWIJZE VAN MEDEWERKERS VAN HET TECHNISCH SECRETARIAAT

### 5  

De voorwaarden voor het aanstellen van personeel dienen van dien aard te zijn dat verzekerd wordt dat de door de Directeur-Generaal in overeenstemming met Titel A vastgestelde procedures worden gevolgd wat betreft de toegang tot en met omgaan met vertrouwelijke informatie.  

### 6  

Voor iedere functie binnen het Technisch Secretariaat dient een formele functieomschrijving te worden opgesteld, waarin wordt omschreven of en in welke mate toegang tot vertrouwelijke informatie in die functie noodzakelijk is.  

### 7  

De Directeur-Generaal, de inspecteurs en de andere medewerkers mogen geen vertrouwelijke informatie onthullen waarvan zij kennis nemen in de verrichting van hun officiële taken aan onbevoegden, zelfs niet na beëindiging van hun functies. Zij mogen aan geen enkele Staat, organisatie of persoon buiten het Technisch Secretariaat informatie doorgeven waartoe zij toegang hebben in verband met hun activiteiten met betrekking tot een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag.  

### 8  

In de uitoefening van hun functie mogen inspecteurs slechts verzoeken om de informatie en gegevens die zij nodig hebben voor de vervulling van hun mandaat. Zij mogen geen dossiers bijhouden van informatie die incidenteel wordt verzameld en geen verband houdt met de verificatie van de naleving van dit Verdrag.  

### 9  

De medewerkers dienen individuele geheimhoudingsovereenkomsten aan te gaan met het Technisch Secretariaat voor de duur van hun aanstelling plus een tijdvak van vijf jaar na de beëindiging daarvan.  

### 10  

Ter vermijding van ongewenste onthulling worden inspecteurs en medewerkers op passende wijze geïnstrueerd over en gewezen op beveiligingsoverwegingen en de mogelijke sancties die hun zouden worden opgelegd in geval van ongewenste onthulling.  

### 11  

Ten minste 30 dagen voordat aan een medewerker toestemming wordt verleend voor toegang tot vertrouwelijke informatie die betrekking heeft op activiteiten op het grondgebied van of op een andere plaats onder de rechtsmacht of het toezicht van een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag, dient die Staat in kennis te worden gesteld van de voorgenomen verlening van toegang. Wat inspecteurs betreft, wordt aan dit vereiste geacht te zijn voldaan met de kennisgeving van een voorgenomen aanwijzing.  

### 12  

Bij de evaluatie van het functioneren van inspecteurs en andere medewerkers van het Technisch Secretariaat dient in het bijzonder te worden gelet op de staat van dienst van de medewerker ten aanzien van de bescherming van vertrouwelijke informatie.  

### C  

####MAATREGELEN TER BESCHERMING VAN GEVOELIGE INSTALLATIES EN TER VOORKOMING VAN DE ONTHULLING VAN VERTROUWELIJKE GEGEVENS IN DE LOOP VAN VERIFICATIE-ACTIVITEITEN TER PLAATSE

### 13  

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag kunnen alle maatregelen nemen die zij noodzakelijk achten ter bescherming van de vertrouwelijkheid, mits zij voldoen aan hun verplichtingen betreffende het aantonen van de naleving van het Verdrag in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende artikelen en de Verificatiebijlage. Een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag die een inspectie ondergaat, kan aan het inspectieteam de uitrusting, de documentatie of de ruimten aanwijzen die hij beschouwt als gevoelig en niet relevant voor de doeleinden van de inspectie.  

### 14  

De inspectieteams dienen zich te laten leiden door het beginsel dat inspecties ter plaatse worden verricht op de minst mogelijke hinder veroorzakende wijze die verenigbaar is met de doeltreffende en tijdige voltooiing van de missie. Zij dienen voorstellen in overweging te nemen die door de Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag die een inspectie ondergaat, in ieder stadium van de inspectie kunnen worden gedaan om te verzekeren dat gevoelige uitrusting of informatie die geen verband houdt met chemische wapens, wordt beschermd.  

### 15  

De inspectieteams dienen zich strikt te houden aan de bepalingen betreffende de verrichting van inspecties in de desbetreffende artikelen en Bijlagen. Zij dienen alle procedures die zijn ontwikkeld ter bescherming van gevoelige installaties en ter voorkoming van de onthulling van vertrouwelijke gegevens, ten volle te eerbiedigen.  

### 16  

Bij het uitwerken van regelingen en inrichtingsakkoorden dient voldoende rekening te worden gehouden met de plicht vertrouwelijke informatie te beschermen. Overeenkomsten inzake inspectieprocedures voor afzonderlijke inrichtingen dienen mede specifieke en gedetailleerde regelingen te omvatten betreffende de vaststellling van de ruimten in de inrichting waartoe de inspecteurs toegang krijgen, de opslag van vertrouwelijke informatie ter plaatse, de reikwijdte van de inspectiewerkzaamheden in de overeengekomen gebieden, het nemen van monsters en de analyse ervan, de toegang tot dossiers en het gebruik van instrumenten en van apparatuur voor constante controle.  

### 17  

Het na iedere inspectie op te stellen verslag dient enkel feiten te bevatten die verband houden met de naleving van dit Verdrag. Het verslag dient te worden behandeld in overeenstemming met de door de Organisatie vastgestelde regels voor het omgaan met vertrouwelijke informatie. Indien nodig mag de in het verslag vervatte informatie in minder gevoelige vormen worden verwerkt voordat zij wordt verspreid buiten het Technisch Secretariaat en wordt doorgegeven aan de geïnspecteerde Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag.  

### D  

####PROCEDURES IN GEVAL VAN SCHENDING OF VERMEENDE SCHENDING VAN DE VERTROUWELIJKHEID

### 18  

De Directeur-Generaal stelt de nodige procedures vast die moeten worden gevolgd in geval van schending of vermeende schending van de vertrouwelijkheid, rekening houdend met de door de Conferentie ingevolge artikel VIII, lid 21, letter i, te bestuderen en goed te keuren aanbevelingen.  

### 19  

De Directeur-Generaal ziet toe op de toepassing van afzonderlijke geheimhoudingsovereenkomsten. De Directeur-Generaal stelt onmiddellijk een onderzoek in indien naar zijn oordeel voldoende factoren erop duiden dat de verplichtingen betreffende het beschermen van vertrouwelijke informatie zijn geschonden. De DirecteurGeneraal stelt ook onmiddellijk een onderzoek in indien een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag beweert dat er sprake is van een schending van de vertrouwelijkheid.  

### 20  

De Directeur-Generaal legt passende strafmaatregelen en disciplinaire maatregelen op aan medewerkers die hun verplichtingen tot het beschermen van vertrouwelijke informatie hebben geschonden. In geval van ernstige schending kan door de Directeur-Generaal afstand worden gedaan van de immuniteit van rechtsmacht.  

### 21  

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag verlenen, voor zover mogelijk, hun medewerking en steun aan de Directeur-Generaal bij het onderzoeken van schendingen of vermeende schendingen van de vertrouwelijkheid en bij het treffen van passende maatregelen indien een schending is vastgesteld.  

### 22  

De Organisatie wordt niet aansprakelijk geacht voor schendingen van de vertrouwelijkheid door medewerkers van het Technisch Secretariaat.  

### 23  

Bij schendingen waarbij zowel een Staat die Partij is bij dit Verdrag als de Organisatie betrokken zijn, wordt de zaak beoordeeld door een „Commissie voor de regeling van geschillen met betrekking tot vertrouwelijkheid", die wordt ingesteld als ondergeschikt orgaan van de Conferentie. Voorschriften betreffende haar samenstelling en werkwijze zullen door de Conferentie tijdens haar eerste vergadering worden aangenomen.
