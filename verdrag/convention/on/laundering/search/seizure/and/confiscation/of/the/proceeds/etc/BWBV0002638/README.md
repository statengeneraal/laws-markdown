1.  A request for confiscation made under Article 13 does not affect the right of the requesting Party to enforce itself the confiscation order.   
2.  Nothing in this Convention shall be so interpreted, as to permit the total value of the confiscation to exceed the amount of the sum of money specified in the confiscation order.

### Article  17  

#### *Imprisonment in default*

### SECTION  5  

####REFUSAL AND POSTPONEMENT OF CO-OPERATION

### Article  18  

#### *Grounds for refusal* 

1.  Co-operation under this Chapter may be refused if: 

a) the action sought would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal system of the requested Party; or  

b) the execution of the request is likely to prejudice the sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests of the requested Party; or  

c) in the opinion of the requested Party, the importance of the case to which the request relates does not justify the taking of the action sought; or  

d) the offence to which the request relates is a political or fiscal offence; or  

e) the requested Party considers that compliance with the action sought would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem; or  

f) the offence to which the request relates would not be an offence under the law of the requested Party if committed within its jurisdiction. However, this ground for refusal applies to co-operation under Section 2 only in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action.     
2.  Co-operation under Section 2, in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Section 3 of this Chapter may also be refused if the measures sought could not be taken under the domestic law of the requested Party for the purposes of investigations or proceedings, had it been a similar domestic case.   
3.  Where the law of the requested Party so requires, co-operation under Section 2, in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Section 3 of this Chapter may also be refused if the measures sought or any other measures having similar effects would not be permitted under the law of the requesting Party, or, as regards the competent authorities of the requesting Party, if the request is not authorised by either a judge or another judicial authority, including public prosecutors, any of these authorities acting in relation to criminal offences.   
4.  Co-operation under Section 4 of this Chapter may also be refused if; 

a) under the law of the requested Party confiscation is not provided for in respect of the type of offence to which the request relates; or  

b) without prejudice to the obligation pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 3, it would be contrary to the principles of the domestic laws of the requested Party concerning the limits of confiscation in respect of the relationship between an offence and 

i) an economic advantage that might be qualified as its proceeds; or  

ii) property that might be qualified as its instrumentalities; or    

c) under the law of the requested Party confiscation may no longer be imposed or enforced because of the lapse of time; or  

d) the request does not relate to a previous conviction, or a decision of a judicial nature or a statement in such a decision that an offence or several offences have been committed, on the basis of which the confiscation has been ordered or is sought; or  

e) confiscation is either not enforceable in the requesting Party, or it is still subject to ordinary means of appeal; or  

f) the request relates to a confiscation order resulting from a decision rendered in absentia of the person against whom the order was issued and, in the opinion of the requested Party, the proceedings conducted by the requesting Party leading to such decision did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone against whom a criminal charge is made.     
5.  For the purpose of paragraph 4 f) of this Article a decision is not considered to have been rendered in absentia if: 

a) it has been confirmed or pronounced after opposition by the person concerned; or  

b) it has been rendered on appeal, provided that the appeal was lodged by the person concerned.     
6.  When considering, for the purposes of paragraph 4 f) of this Article if the minimum rights of defence have been satisfied, the requested Party shall take into account the fact that the person concerned has deliberately sought to evade justice or if that person, having had the possibility of lodging a legal remedy against the decision made in absentia, elected not to do so. The same will apply when the person concerned, having been duly served with the summons to appear, elected not to do so nor to ask for adjournment.   
7.  A Party shall not invoke bank secrecy as a ground to refuse any co-operation under this Chapter. Where its domestic law so requires, a Party may require that a request for co-operation which would involve the lifting of bank secrecy be authorised by either a judge or another judicial authority, including public prosecutors, any of these authorities acting in relation to criminal offences.   
8.  Without prejudice to the ground for refusal provided for in paragraph 1 a) of this Article: 

a) the fact that the person under investigation or subjected to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting Party is a legal person shall not be invoked by the requested Party as an obstacle to affording any co-operation under this Chapter.  

b) The fact that the natural person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently died or the fact that a legal person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently been dissolved shall not be invoked as an obstacle to render assistance in accordance with Article 13, paragraph la).     

### Article  19  

#### *Postponement* 

The requested Party may postpone action on a request if such action would prejudice investigations or proceedings by its authorities.  

### Article  20  

#### *Partial or conditional granting of a request* 

Before refusing or postponing co-operation under this Chapter, the requested Party shall, where appropriate after having consulted the requesting Party, consider whether the request may be granted partially or subject to such conditions as it deems necessary.  

### SECTION  6  

####NOTIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF THIRD PARTIES' RIGHTS

### Article  21  

#### *Notification of documents* 

1.  The Parties shall afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in the serving of judicial documents to persons affected by provisional measures and confiscation.

a) the possibility to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad;  

b) the possibility for judicial officers, officials or other competent authorities of the Party of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the consular authorities of that party or through judicial officers, officials or other competent authorities of the Party of destination;   unless the Party of destination makes a declaration to the contrary to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.   
3.  When serving judicial documents to persons abroad affected by provisional measures or confiscation orders issued in the sending Party, this Party shall indicate what legal remedies are available under its law to such persons.   

### Article  22  

#### *Recognition of foreign decisions* 

1.  When dealing with a request for co-operation under Sections 3 and 4, the requested Party shall recognise any judicial decision taken in the requesting Party regarding rights claimed by third parties.   
2.  Recognition may be refused if: 

a) third parties did not have adequate opportunity to assert their rights; or  

b) the decision is incompatible with a decision already taken in the requested Party on the same matter; or  

c) it is incompatible with the ordre public of the requested Party; or  

d) the decision was taken contrary to provisions on exclusive jurisdiction provided for by the law of the requested Party.

#### *Verplichting tot verlening van rechtshulp* 

De Partijen verlenen elkander de ruimst mogelijke mate van rechtshulp bij het identificeren en opsporen van hulpmiddelen, opbrengsten en andere voorwerpen die vatbaar zijn voor confiscatie.

De rechtshulp ingevolge artikel 8 wordt uitgevoerd op grond van en in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij en in overeenstemming met de in het verzoek omschreven procedures, voor zover deze niet onverenigbaar zijn met genoemde nationale wetgeving.  

### Artikel  10  

#### *Uit eigen beweging verstrekte informatie* 

Zonder afbreuk te doen aan haar eigen onderzoeken of procedures, kan een Partij zonder voorafgaand verzoek aan een andere Partij informatie verstrekken omtrent hulpmiddelen en opbrengsten, wanneer zij van oordeel is dat het verstrekken van die informatie de ontvangende Partij van nut kan zijn voor het instellen of afronden van onderzoeken of procedures, of zou kunnen leiden tot een verzoek van die Partij krachtens dit hoofdstuk.  

### AFDELING  3  

####VOORLOPIGE MAATREGELEN

### Artikel  11  

#### *Verplichting voorlopige maatregelen te nemen* 

1.  Een Partij neemt op verzoek van een andere Partij die een strafrechtelijke procedure of een procedure tot confiscatie heeft ingesteld, de noodzakelijke voorlopige maatregelen, zoals bevriezing of inbeslagneming, ter voorkoming van de verhandeling, overdracht of vervreemding van voorwerpen die in een later stadium het onderwerp zouden kunnen vormen van een verzoek om confiscatie, of die van dien aard zijn, dat daarmede gevolg zou kunnen worden gegeven aan dat verzoek.   
2.  Een Partij die een verzoek om confiscatie heeft ontvangen overeenkomstig artikel 13, neemt, indien daarom wordt verzocht, de in het eerste lid van dit artikel genoemde maatregelen met betrekking tot voorwerpen die het onderwerp vormen van het verzoek, of die van dien aard zijn, dat daarmede gevolg zou kunnen worden gegeven aan het verzoek.

De in artikel 11 genoemde voorlopige maatregelen worden uitgevoerd op grond van en in overeenstemming met de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij en in overeenstemming met de in het verzoek omschreven procedures, voor zover deze niet onverenigbaar zijn met genoemde nationale wetgeving.   
2.  Alvorens een uit hoofde van dit artikel genomen voorlopige maatregel op te heffen, stelt de aangezochte Partij, indien mogelijk, de verzoekende Partij in de gelegenheid redenen op te geven om de maatregel te handhaven.   

### AFDELING  4  

####CONFISCATIE

### Artikel  13  

#### *Verplichting tot confiscatie* 

1.  Een Partij die van een andere Partij een verzoek om confiscatie heeft ontvangen betreffende hulpmiddelen of opbrengsten die zich op haar grondgebied bevinden, moet: 

a. de door een rechter van de verzoekende Partij gegeven beslissing tot confiscatie ten uitvoer leggen met betrekking tot die hulpmiddelen of opbrengsten; of  

b. het verzoek voorleggen aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten, ten einde een beslissing tot confiscatie te verkrijgen, en de beslissing ten uitvoer leggen, indien zij wordt gegeven.     
2.  Voor de toepassing van het eerste lid, letter b, van dit artikel is elke Partij, indien noodzakelijk, bevoegd een procedure tot confiscatie in te stellen krachtens haar eigen wetgeving.   
3.  De bepalingen van het eerste lid van dit artikel zijn ook van toepassing op confiscatie bestaande in de verplichting een geldbedrag te betalen dat overeenkomt met de waarde van de opbrengsten, indien zich op het grondgebied van de aangezochte Partij voorwerpen bevinden waarop de confiscatie ten uitvoer kan worden gelegd. In dat geval ziet de aangezochte Partij, wanneer zij overgaat tot de tenuitvoerlegging van de confiscatie overeenkomstig het eerste lid, erop toe dat de vordering, indien geen betaling wordt verkregen, wordt verhaald op voorwerpen die voor dat doel beschikbaar zijn.   
4.  Indien een verzoek om confiscatie betrekking heeft op een bepaald voorwerp, kunnen de Partijen overeenkomen dat de aangezochte Partij kan overgaan tot confiscatie in de vorm van een verplichting een geldbedrag te betalen dat overeenkomt met de waarde van het voorwerp.   

### Artikel  14  

#### *Tenuitvoerlegging van de confiscatie* 

1.  De procedures tot verkrijging en tenuitvoerlegging van de confiscatie krachtens artikel 13 worden beheerst door de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij.   
2.  De aangezochte Partij is gebonden aan de vaststelling van de feiten, voor zover deze zijn uiteengezet in een veroordeling of rechterlijke uitspraak van de verzoekende Partij of voor zover deze veroordeling of rechterlijke uitspraak impliciet daarop is gegrond.   
3.  Elke Partij kan op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding, door middel van een verklaring gericht aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa, verklaren dat het tweede lid van dit artikel slechts van toepassing is met inachtneming van haar grondwettelijke beginselen en de grondbeginselen van haar rechtsstelsel.   
4.  Indien de confiscatie bestaat in de verplichting een geldbedrag te betalen, zet de bevoegde autoriteit van de aangezochte Partij dit bedrag om in de munteenheid van die Partij tegen de wisselkoers die geldt op het tijdstip waarop de beslissing om tot confiscatie over te gaan wordt genomen.   
5.  In het geval bedoeld in artikel 13, eerste lid, letter a, heeft alleen de verzoekende Partij het recht uitspraak te doen over een verzoek om herziening van de beslissing tot confiscatie.   

### Artikel  15  

#### *Geconfisqueerde voorwerpen* 

De aangezochte Partij beschikt over de geconfisqueerde voorwerpen in overeenstemming met haar nationale wetgeving, tenzij de Partijen anderszins zijn overeengekomen.  

### Artikel  16  

#### *Recht op tenuitvoerlegging en maximum bedrag van de confiscatie* 

1.  Een verzoek om confiscatie uit hoofde van artikel 13 laat het recht van de verzoekende Partij om de beslissing tot confiscatie zelf ten uitvoer te leggen onverlet.   
2.  Geen enkele bepaling van deze Overeenkomst mag zodanig worden uitgelegd dat daardoor de totale waarde van de geconfisqueerde voorwerpen hoger zou zijn dan het in de beslissing tot confiscatie genoemde bedrag. Indien een Partij vaststelt dat dit zich zou kunnen voordoen, plegen de betrokken Partijen overleg ten einde bedoeld gevolg te vermijden.   

### Artikel  17  

#### *Lijfsdwang* 

De aangezochte Partij mag geen lijfsdwang of enige andere vrijheid beperkende maatregel opleggen naar aanleiding van een verzoek uit hoofde van artikel 13, indien de verzoekende Partij zulks in het verzoek heeft aangegeven.  

### AFDELING  5  

####WEIGERING EN UITSTEL VAN DE SAMENWERKING

### Artikel  18  

#### *Gronden voor weigering* 

1.  Samenwerking ingevolge dit hoofdstuk kan worden geweigerd indien: 

a. de maatregel waarom wordt verzocht in strijd is met de grondbeginselen van het rechtsstelsel van de aangezochte Partij; of  

b. de uitvoering van het verzoek de soevereiniteit, veiligheid, openbare orde of andere wezenlijke belangen van de aangezochte partij zou kunnen schaden; of  

c. naar het oordeel van de aangezochte Partij het belang van de zaak waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft het nemen van de verlangde maatregel niet rechtvaardigt; of  

d. het strafbare feit waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft een politiek of fiscaal delict is; of  

e. de aangezochte Partij van oordeel is dat de ten uitvoerlegging van verlangde maatregel in strijd zou komen met het beginsel „ne bis in idem”; of  

f. het feit waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft niet strafbaar is krachtens de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij indien het binnen haar rechtsgebied zou zijn begaan. Deze weigeringsgrond geldt echter slechts voor samenwerking uit hoofde van afdeling 2 voor zover de verlangde rechtshulp toepassing van dwangmiddelen inhoudt.     
2.  Samenwerking uit hoofde van afdeling 2, voor zover de verlangde rechtshulp toepassing van dwangmiddelen inhoudt, en uit hoofde van afdeling 3 van dit hoofdstuk kan ook worden geweigerd indien de verlangde maatregelen krachtens de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij niet zouden kunnen worden genomen voor opsporings- of vervolgingsdoeleinden, indien het een soortgelijke binnenlandse zaak zou betreffen.   
3.  Wanneer de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij zulks vereist, kan samenwerking uit hoofde van afdeling 2, voor zover de verlangde rechtshulp toepassing van dwangmiddelen inhoudt, en uit hoofde van afdeling 3 van dit hoofdstuk ook worden geweigerd indien de verlangde maatregelen, of andere maatregelen van soortgelijke strekking, niet zijn toegestaan krachtens de wetgeving van de verzoekende Partij of, wat de bevoegde autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij betreft, indien voor het verzoek geen machtiging is verleend door een rechter of een andere rechterlijke autoriteit, met inbegrip van het openbaar ministerie, met dien verstande dat deze autoriteiten handelen in het kader van strafzaken.   
4.  Samenwerking uit hoofde van afdeling 4 van dit hoofdstuk kan ook worden geweigerd indien: 

a. de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij niet voorziet in confiscatie ten aanzien van het soort delict waarop het verzoek betrekking heeft; of  

b. onverminderd de verplichting uit hoofde van artikel 13, derde lid, de samenwerking in strijd is met de beginselen van de nationale wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij betreffende de mogelijkheden van confiscatie, gelet op het verband tussen een strafbaar feit en 

i. een economisch voordeel dat zou kunnen worden aangemerkt als de opbrengst daarvan; of  

ii. voorwerpen die zouden kunnen worden aangemerkt als de hulpmiddelen; of    

c. krachtens de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij de confiscatie niet langer kan worden uitgesproken of ten uitvoer gelegd wegens verjaring; of  

d. het verzoek geen betrekking heeft op een eerdere veroordeling, noch op een rechterlijke uitspraak of een verklaring in een dergelijke uitspraak dat één of meer strafbare feiten zijn begaan, waarop de beslissing tot of het verzoek om confiscatie is gebaseerd; of  

e. de confiscatie niet voor tenuitvoerlegging vatbaar is in de verzoekende Partij, of indien daartegen nog gewone rechtsmiddelen openstaan; of  

f. het verzoek betrekking heeft op een beslissing tot confiscatie die is gegeven bij afwezigheid van de persoon tegen wie de beslissing is gericht en de door de verzoekende Partij ingestelde procedure die tot deze beslissing heeft geleid, naar het oordeel van de aangezochte Partij, niet in voldoende mate de erkende minimumverdedigingsrechten heeft geëerbiedigd welke aan een ieder die wordt verdacht van een strafbaar feit geacht worden toe te komen.     
5.  Voor de toepassing van het vierde lid, letter f, van dit artikel wordt een beslissing niet geacht bij afwezigheid te zijn gegeven indien: 

a. zij is bevestigd of uitgesproken na verzet door de betrokkene; of  

b. zij is gegeven in hoger beroep, mits dit beroep is ingesteld door de betrokkene.     
6.  Bij de beoordeling, ten behoeve van het vierde lid, letter f, van dit artikel, of de minimum-verdedigingsrechten in voldoende mate zijn geëerbiedigd, houdt de aangezochte Partij rekening met het feit dat de betrokkene bewust heeft getracht zich aan zijn berechting te onttrekken, dan wel dat de betrokkene, indien hij de mogelijkheid heeft gehad een rechtsmiddel in te stellen tegen een bij afwezigheid gegeven beslissing, heeft verkozen zulks niet te doen. Hetzelfde geldt wanneer de betrokkene, nadat hij naar behoren is gedagvaard om te verschijnen, heeft verkozen niet te verschijnen of geen uitstel te vragen.   
7.  Een Partij kan zich niet beroepen op het bankgeheim als grond om samenwerking ingevolge dit hoofdstuk te weigeren. Wanneer haar nationale wetgeving zulks vereist, kan een Partij verlangen dat voor een verzoek om samenwerking dat opheffing van het bankgeheim inhoudt, machtiging wordt verleend door een rechter of een andere rechterlijke autoriteit, met inbegrip van het openbaar ministerie, met dien verstande dat deze autoriteiten handelen in het kader van strafzaken.   
8.  Zonder afbreuk te doen aan de weigeringsgrond bedoeld in het eerste lid, letter a, van dit artikel: 

a. kan het feit dat de persoon tegen wie een onderzoek of een door de autoriteiten van de verzoekende Partij gegeven beslissing tot confiscatie is gericht, een rechtspersoon is, niet door de aangezochte Partij worden aangevoerd als beletsel om rechtshulp te verlenen ingevolge dit hoofdstuk;  

b. kan het feit dat de natuurlijke persoon tegen wie een beslissing tot confiscatie van opbrengsten is gegeven, later is overleden, dan wel het feit dat een rechtspersoon waartegen een beslissing tot confiscatie van opbrengsten is gegeven, later is ontbonden, niet worden aangevoerd als beletsel om rechtshulp te verlenen in overeenstemming met artikel 13, eerste lid, letter a.     

### Artikel  19  

#### *Uitstel* 

De aangezochte Partij mag de uitvoering van de in een verzoek genoemde maatregelen uitstellen, indien deze onderzoeken of procedures ingesteld door haar autoriteiten zouden kunnen schaden.  

### Artikel  20  

#### *Gedeeltelijke of voorwaardelijke inwilliging van een verzoek* 

Alvorens samenwerking ingevolge dit hoofdstuk te weigeren of uit te stellen, overweegt de aangezochte Partij, indien passend, na overleg met de verzoekende Partij, of het verzoek gedeeltelijk kan worden ingewilligd, dan wel onder de voorwaarden die zij noodzakelijk acht.  

### AFDELING  6  

####BETEKENING EN BESCHERMING VAN RECHTEN VAN DERDEN

### Artikel  21  

#### *Betekening van stukken* 

1.  De Partijen kennen elkander de ruimste mate van wederzijdse rechtshulp toe bij de betekening van gerechtelijke stukken aan personen die worden getroffen door voorlopige maatregelen en confiscatie.   
2.  Geen enkele bepaling van dit artikel staat de mogelijkheid in de weg: 

a. dat gerechtelijke stukken rechtstreeks over de post worden toegezonden aan personen in het buitenland;  

b. dat deurwaarders, ambtenaren of andere bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partij van herkomst van gerechtelijke stukken rechtstreeks door de consulaire autoriteiten van die Partij of door de deurwaarders, ambtenaren of andere bevoegde autoriteiten van de Partij van bestemming, betekening of kennisgeving doen verrichten,   tenzij de Partij van bestemming op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van de akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding een andersluidende verklaring richt aan de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa.   
3.  Bij de betekening van gerechtelijke stukken in het buitenland aan personen die worden getroffen door voorlopige maatregelen of beslissingen tot confiscatie die zijn genomen in de verzendende Partij, stelt deze Partij die personen in kennis van de rechtsmiddelen die krachtens haar wetgeving openstaan.   

### Artikel  22  

#### *Erkenning van buitenlandse beslissingen* 

1.  Bij de behandeling van een verzoek om samenwerking uit hoofde van de afdelingen 3 en 4 erkent de aangezochte Partij alle rechterlijke beslissingen die in de verzoekende Partij zijn gegeven met betrekking tot rechten waarop derden aanspraak maken of hebben gemaakt.   
2.  Erkenning kan worden geweigerd indien 

a. derden onvoldoende gelegenheid hebben gehad hun rechten te doen gelden;  

b. de beslissing onverenigbaar is met een beslissing die reeds in de aangezochte Partij is gegeven met betrekking tot dezelfde aangelegenheid; of  

c. zij onverenigbaar is met de openbare orde van de aangezochte Partij; of  

d. de beslissing is genomen in strijd met de bepalingen inzake de exclusieve rechtsmacht waarin de wetgeving van de aangezochte Partij voorziet.     

### AFDELING  7  

####PROCEDUREREGELS EN ANDERE ALGEMENE REGELS

### Artikel  23  

#### *Centrale autoriteit* 

1.  De Partijen wijzen een centrale autoriteit of, indien noodzakelijk, meerdere autoriteiten aan, belast met de verzending en de beantwoording van verzoeken ingevolge dit hoofdstuk, de uitvoering daarvan, dan wel de doorzending daarvan aan de autoriteiten die bevoegd zijn deze uit te voeren.   
2.  Elke Partij doet op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bij de nederlegging van haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding, goedkeuring of toetreding de Secretaris-Generaal van de Raad van Europa mededeling van de namen en adressen van de autoriteiten die zijn aangewezen uit hoofde van het eerste lid van dit artikel.   

### Artikel  24  

#### *Rechtstreeks contact* 

1.  De centrale autoriteiten onderhouden rechtstreeks met elkaar contacten.
