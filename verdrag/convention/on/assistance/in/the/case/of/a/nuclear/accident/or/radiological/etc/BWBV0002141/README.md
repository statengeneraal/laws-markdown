2.  Wanneer de bijstand geheel of gedeeltelijk tegen vergoeding wordt verleend, vergoedt de verzoekende Staat aan de bijstandverlenende partij de gemaakte kosten voor de verleende diensten door personen of organisaties die namens die partij optreden, alsmede alle uitgaven in verband met de bijstandverlening voor zover deze uitgaven niet rechtstreeks door de verzoekende Staat worden betaald. Tenzij anders overeengekomen, wordt de vergoeding onmiddellijk betaald nadat de bijstandverlenende partij haar verzoek tot vergoeding heeft aangeboden aan de verzoekende Staat, en geschiedt de betaling met betrekking tot andere dan plaatselijke kosten in vrij inwisselbare valuta.   
3.  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in het tweede lid kan de bijstandverlenende partij te allen tijde afzien van, of toestemmen in uitstel van betaling van, de gehele vergoeding of een gedeelte daarvan. Bij het overnemen van de vraag of van deze vergoeding moet worden afgezien of uitstel van betaling moet worden verleend, houden de bijstandverlenende partijen terdege rekening met de behoeften van de ontwikkelingslanden.

8.  Niets in dit artikel doet afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen met betrekking tot de voorrechten en immuniteiten die krachtens andere internationale overeenkomsten of krachtens de regels van het internationale gewoonterecht zijn verleend.   
9.  Bij de ondertekening, bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van of toetreding tot dit Verdrag kan een Staat verklaren zich niet geheel of gedeeltelijk door het bepaalde in het tweede en het derde lid gebonden te achten.

Ingeval een geschil aan arbitrage wordt onderworpen, kan een partij bij het geschil, indien binnen zes maanden na de datum van het verzoek de partijen bij het geschil geen overeenstemming kunnen bereiken over de wijze van arbitrage, de President van het Internationale Gerechtshof of de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties verzoeken één of meer scheidsmannen aan te wijzen.
