### Article  6  

####Respect for cultural property

With the goal of ensuring respect for cultural property in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention:

b) a waiver on the basis of imperative military necessity pursuant to Article 4 paragraph 2 of the Convention may only be invoked to use cultural property for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage when and for as long as no choice is possible between such use of the cultural property and another feasible method for obtaining a similar military advantage;  

c) the decision to invoke imperative military necessity shall only be taken by an officer commanding a force the equivalent of a battalion in size or larger, or a force smaller in size where circumstances do not permit otherwise;  

d) in case of an attack based on a decision taken in accordance with sub-paragraph a), an effective advance warning shall be given whenever circumstances permit.

(i) that the objective is cultural property protected under Article 4 of the Convention;  

(ii) that the attack may be expected to cause incidental damage to cultural property protected under Article 4 of the Convention which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.

### CHAPTER  III  

####ENHANCED PROTECTION

### Article  10  

####Enhanced protection

Cultural property may be placed under enhanced protection provided that it meets the following three conditions: 

a) it is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;  

b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection;  

c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.    

### Article  11  

####The granting of enhanced protection

1.  Each Party should submit to the Committee a list of cultural property for which it intends to request the granting of enhanced protection.   
2.  The Party which has jurisdiction or control over the cultural property may request that it be included in the List to be established in accordance with Article 27 sub-paragraph 1b). This request shall include all necessary information related to the criteria mentioned in Article 10. The Committee may invite a Party to request that cultural property be included in the List.   
3.  Other Parties, the International Committee of the Blue Shield and other non-governmental organisations with relevant expertise may recommend specific cultural property to the Committee. In such cases, the Committee may decide to invite a Party to request inclusion of that cultural property in the List.   
4.  Neither the request for inclusion of cultural property situated in a territory, sovereignty or jurisdiction over which is claimed by more than one State, nor its inclusion, shall in any way prejudice the rights of the parties to the dispute.   
5.  Upon receipt of a request for inclusion in the List, the Committee shall inform all Parties of the request. Parties may submit representations regarding such a request to the Committee within sixty days. These representations shall be made only on the basis of the criteria mentioned in Article 10. They shall be specific and related to facts. The Committee shall consider the representations, providing the Party requesting inclusion with a reasonable opportunity to respond before taking the decision. When such representations are before the Committee, decisions for inclusion in the List shall be taken, notwithstanding Article 26, by a majority of four-fifths of its members present and voting.   
6.  In deciding upon a request, the Committee should ask the advice of governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as of individual experts.   
7.  A decision to grant or deny enhanced protection may only be made on the basis of the criteria mentioned in Article 10.   
8.  In exceptional cases, when the Committee has concluded that the Party requesting inclusion of cultural property in the List cannot fulfil the criteria of Article 10 sub-paragraph b), the Committee may decide to grant enhanced protection, provided that the requesting Party submits a request for international assistance under Article 32.   
9.  Upon the outbreak of hostilities, a Party to the conflict may request, on an emergency basis, enhanced protection of cultural property under its jurisdiction or control by communicating this request to the Committee. The Committee shall transmit this request immediately to all Parties to the conflict. In such cases the Committee will consider representations from the Parties concerned on an expedited basis. The decision to grant provisional enhanced protection shall be taken as soon as possible and, notwithstanding Article 26, by a majority of four-fifths of its members present and voting. Provisional enhanced protection may be granted by the Committee pending the outcome of the regular procedure for the granting of enhanced protection, provided that the provisions of Article 10 sub-paragraphs a) and c) are met.   
10.  Enhanced protection shall be granted to cultural property by the Committee from the moment of its entry in the List.   
11.  The Director-General shall, without delay, send to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to all Parties notification of any decision of the Committee to include cultural property on the List.   

### Article  12  

####Immunity of cultural property under enhanced protection

The Parties to a conflict shall ensure the immunity of cultural property under enhanced protection by refraining from making such property the object of attack or from any use of the property or its immediate surroundings in support of military action.  

### Article  13  

####Loss of enhanced protection

1.  Cultural property under enhanced protection shall only lose such protection: 

a) if such protection is suspended or cancelled in accordance with Article 14; or  

b) if, and for as long as, the property has, by its use, become a military objective.     
2.  In the circumstances of sub-paragraph 1b), such property may only be the object of attack if: 

a) the attack is the only feasible means of terminating the use of the property referred to in sub-paragraph 1b);  

b) all feasible precautions are taken in the choice of means and methods of attack, with a view to terminating such use and avoiding, or in any event minimising, damage to the cultural property;  

c) unless circumstances do not permit, due to requirements of immediate self-defence: 

(i) the attack is ordered at the highest operational level of command;  

(ii) effective advance warning is issued to the opposing forces requiring the termination of the use referred to in sub-paragraph 1b); and  

(iii) reasonable time is given to the opposing forces to redress the situation.       

### Article  14  

####Suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection

1.  Where cultural property no longer meets any one of the criteria in Article 10 of this Protocol, the Committee may suspend its enhanced protection status or cancel that status by removing that cultural property from the List.   
2.  In the case of a serious violation of Article 12 in relation to cultural property under enhanced protection arising from its use in support of military action, the Committee may suspend its enhanced protection status. Where such violations are continuous, the Committee may exceptionally cancel the enhanced protection status by removing the cultural property from the List.   
3.  The Director-General shall, without delay, send to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to all Parties to this Protocol notification of any decision of the Committee to suspend or cancel the enhanced protection of cultural property.

b) using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action;  

c) extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol;

When doing so, Parties shall comply with general principles of law and international law, including the rules extending individual criminal responsibility to persons other than those who directly commit the act.   

### Article  16  

####Jurisdiction

1.  Without prejudice to paragraph 2, each Party shall take the necessary legislative measures to establish its jurisdiction over offences set forth in Article 15 in the following cases: 

a) when such an offence is committed in the territory of that State;  

b) when the alleged offender is a national of that State;  

c) in the case of offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs a) to c), when the alleged offender is present in its territory.     
2.  With respect to the exercise of jurisdiction and without prejudice to Article 28 of the Convention: 

a) this Protocol does not preclude the incurring of individual criminal responsibility or the exercise of jurisdiction under national and international law that may be applicable, or affect the exercise of jurisdiction under customary international law;  

b) except in so far as a State which is not Party to this Protocol may accept and apply its provisions in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 2, members of the armed forces and nationals of a State which is not Party to this Protocol, except for those nationals serving in the armed forces of a State which is a Party to this Protocol, do not incur individual criminal responsibility by virtue of this Protocol, nor does this Protocol impose an obligation to establish jurisdiction over such persons or to extradite them.     

### Article  17  

####Prosecution

1.  The Party in whose territory the alleged offender of an offence set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c) is found to be present shall, if it does not extradite that person, submit, without exception whatsoever and without undue delay, the case to its competent authorities, for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with its domestic law or with, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law.   
2.  Without prejudice to, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law, any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with the Convention or this Protocol shall be guaranteed fair treatment and a fair trial in accordance with domestic law and international law at all stages of the proceedings, and in no cases shall be provided guarantees less favorable to such person than those provided by international law.   

### Article  18  

####Extradition

1.  The offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c) shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the Parties before the entry into force of this Protocol. Parties undertake to include such offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them.   
2.  When a Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested Party may, at its option, consider the present Protocol as the legal basis for extradition in respect of offences as set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c).   
3.  Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognise the offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c) as extraditable offences between them, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested Party.   
4.  If necessary, offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c) shall be treated, for the purposes of extradition between Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the Parties that have established jurisdiction in accordance with Article 16 paragraph 1.   

### Article  19  

####Mutual legal assistance

1.  Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in Article 15, including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings.   
2.  Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrangements, Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their domestic law.   

### Article  20  

####Grounds for refusal

1.  For the purpose of extradition, offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c), and for the purpose of mutual legal assistance, offences set forth in Article 15 shall not be regarded as political offences nor as offences connected with political offences nor as offences inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such offences may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.   
2.  Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 a) to c) or for mutual legal assistance with respect to offences set forth in Article 15 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons.   

### Article  21  

####Measures regarding other violations

Without prejudice to Article 28 of the Convention, each Party shall adopt such legislative, administrative or disciplinary measures as may be necessary to suppress the following acts when committed intentionally: 

a) any use of cultural property in violation of the Convention or this Protocol;  

b) any illicit export, other removal or transfer of ownership of cultural property from occupied territory in violation of the Convention or this Protocol.

4.  Nothing in this Protocol shall prejudice the primary jurisdiction of a Party in whose territory an armed conflict not of an international character occurs over the violations set forth in Article 15.   
5.  Nothing in this Protocol shall be invoked as a justification for intervening, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the armed conflict or in the internal or external affairs of the Party in the territory of which that conflict occurs.

### HOOFDSTUK  2  

####ALGEMENE BEPALINGEN INZAKE BESCHERMING

### Artikel  5  

####Veiligstelling van cultuurgoederen

De in vredestijd getroffen voorbereidende maatregelen voor de veiligstelling van cultuurgoederen tegen de voorzienbare gevolgen van een gewapend conflict ingevolge artikel 3 van het Verdrag omvatten, naargelang hetgeen van toepassing is, het opstellen van inventarislijsten, het plannen van noodmaatregelen voor de bescherming tegen brand of instorting van gebouwen, de voorbereiding van de verwijdering van roerende cultuurgoederen of de verschaffing van een passende *in situ* bescherming voor dergelijke goederen, en de aanwijzing van bevoegde autoriteiten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de veiligstelling van cultuurgoederen.  

### Artikel  6  

####Eerbiediging van cultuurgoederen

Met het doel de eerbiediging van cultuurgoederen in overeenstemming met artikel 4 van het Verdrag te waarborgen: 

a. kan op grond van een gebiedende militaire noodzaak overeenkomstig artikel 4, tweede lid, van het Verdrag alleen worden afgeweken voor het richten van een vijandelijk optreden tegen cultuurgoederen, wanneer en zolang: 

i. dat culturele goed, door zijn functie, is verworden tot een militair doel, en  

ii. er geen praktisch uitvoerbaar alternatief bestaat ter verkrijging van een militair voordeel dat gelijkwaardig is aan het voordeel dat wordt behaald door het richten van een vijandelijk optreden tegen dat doel;    

b. kan op grond van een gebiedende militaire noodzaak overeenkomstig artikel 4, tweede lid, van het Verdrag alleen worden afgeweken voor het gebruik van cultuurgoederen voor doeleinden waardoor deze goederen mogelijk worden blootgesteld aan vernietiging of beschadiging, wanneer en zolang er geen keuze mogelijk is tussen een dergelijk gebruik van de cultuurgoederen en een andere praktisch uitvoerbare methode ter verkrijging van een gelijkwaardig militair voordeel;  

c. de beslissing een beroep te doen op een gebiedende militaire noodzaak wordt alleen genomen door een officier die het bevel voert over een eenheid die in omvang vergelijkbaar is met een bataljon of groter, of over een formatie van kleinere omvang, indien de omstandigheden geen andere mogelijkheid toelaten;  

d. in geval van een aanval op basis van een beslissing overeenkomstig letter a, moet, telkens wanneer de omstandigheden dit toelaten, een doeltreffende vroegtijdige waarschuwing worden gegeven.    

### Artikel  7  

####Voorzorgen bij aanvallen

Onverminderd andere voorzorgen die zijn voorgeschreven door het internationale humanitaire recht bij de uitvoering van militaire operaties, dient elke Partij bij het conflict: 

a. alles te doen wat praktisch uitvoerbaar is om te verifiëren of de aan te vallen doelen geen cultuurgoederen zijn die ingevolge artikel 4 van het Verdrag worden beschermd;  

b. alle praktisch uitvoerbare voorzorgen te nemen bij de keuze van middelen en methoden voor de aanval teneinde bijkomende schade aan cultuurgoederen die ingevolge artikel 4 van het Verdrag worden beschermd, te voorkomen, en in ieder geval tot het uiterste te beperken;  

c. af te zien van enige aanval waarvan kan worden verwacht dat deze bijkomende schade toebrengt aan de ingevolge artikel 4 van het Verdrag beschermde cultuurgoederen, die met betrekking tot het te verwachten tastbare en rechtstreekse militaire voordeel buitensporig zou zijn; en  

d. een aanval af te gelasten of op te schorten indien duidelijk wordt: 

i. dat het doel een ingevolge artikel 4 van het Verdrag beschermd cultuurgoed is;  

ii. dat van de aanval kan worden verwacht dat deze bijkomende schade veroorzaakt aan ingevolge artikel 4 van het Verdrag beschermde cultuurgoederen, die in verhouding tot het te verwachten tastbare en rechtstreekse militaire voordeel buitensporig zal zijn.      

### Artikel  8  

####Voorzorgen tegen de gevolgen van vijandelijkheden

De partijen bij het conflict dienen, zo veel mogelijk als praktisch uitvoerbaar is: 

a. roerende cultuurgoederen uit de nabijheid van militaire doelen te verwijderen of passende *in situ* bescherming te verschaffen;  

b. het plaatsen van militaire doelen in de nabijheid van cultuurgoederen te vermijden.    

### Artikel  9  

####Bescherming van cultuurgoederen in bezet gebied

1.   Onverminderd de bepalingen van de artikelen 4 en 5 het Verdrag dient een Partij die het grondgebied van een andere Partij geheel of gedeeltelijk bezet houdt, met betrekking tot het bezette gebied te verbieden en te voorkomen dat: 

a. onrechtmatige uitvoer, andere verplaatsing of overdracht van de eigendom van cultuurgoederen plaatsvindt;  

b. archeologische opgravingen plaatsvinden, behoudens wanneer dit absoluut noodzakelijk is om cultuurgoederen veilig te stellen, te registreren of in stand te houden;  

c. wijziging of verandering van het gebruik van cultuurgoederen plaatsvindt, met het oogmerk cultureel, historisch of wetenschappelijk bewijs te maskeren of te vernietigen.     
2.   Archeologische opgravingen, wijzigingen of verandering van het gebruik van cultuurgoederen in bezet gebied dienen, tenzij de omstandigheden zulks niet toelaten, plaats te vinden in nauwe samenwerking met de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten van het bezette gebied.   

### HOOFDSTUK  3  

####VERHOOGDE BESCHERMING

### Artikel  10  

####Verhoogde bescherming

Een cultuurgoed kan onder verhoogde bescherming worden gesteld indien het voldoet aan de volgende drie voorwaarden: 

a. het betreft een cultuurgoed dat voor de mensheid van het hoogste belang is;  

b. het wordt beschermd door passende nationale wettelijke en bestuurlijke maatregelen waarbij de uitzonderlijke culturele en historische waarde ervan wordt erkend en het hoogste niveau van bescherming wordt gewaarborgd;  

c. het wordt niet gebruikt voor militaire doeleinden of om militaire locaties te beschermen en de Partij onder wier zeggenschap het zich bevindt heeft in een verklaring bevestigd dat het goed hiervoor niet zal worden gebruikt.    

### Artikel  11  

####Verlening van verhoogde bescherming

1.   Elke Partij dient het Comité een lijst van cultuurgoederen in te dienen voor welke zij van plan is om verlening van verhoogde bescherming te verzoeken.   
2.   De Partij die rechtsmacht of zeggenschap uitoefent over een cultuurgoed kan verzoeken dat het wordt opgenomen in de overeenkomstig artikel 27, eerste lid, letter b, op te stellen Lijst. Dit verzoek dient alle benodigde informatie met betrekking tot de in artikel 10 vermelde criteria te omvatten. Het Comité kan een Partij uitnodigen te verzoeken om opneming van cultuurgoederen in de Lijst.   
3.   Andere Partijen, het Internationale Comité van het Blauwe Schild en andere niet-gouvernementele organisaties met relevante deskundigheid kunnen specifieke cultuurgoederen aan het Comité aanbevelen. In dergelijke gevallen kan het Comité besluiten een Partij uit te nodigen te verzoeken om opneming van dat culturele goed in de Lijst.   
4.   Noch het verzoek om opneming van een cultuurgoed dat zich op een grondgebied bevindt, waarover de soevereiniteit of de rechtsmacht door meer dan één Staat wordt opgeëist, noch de opneming van een dergelijk goed, doet op enigerlei wijze afbreuk aan de rechten van de partijen bij het geschil.   
5.   Na ontvangst van een verzoek om opneming in de Lijst, brengt het Comité alle Partijen van het verzoek op de hoogte. De Partijen kunnen binnen zestig dagen hun bezwaren met betrekking tot een dergelijk verzoek indienen bij het Comité. Deze bezwaren mogen uitsluitend gebaseerd zijn op de in artikel 10 vermelde criteria. De bezwaren moeten specifiek zijn en betrekking hebben op feiten. Het Comité neemt de bezwaren in behandeling, waarbij het de Partij die om opneming verzoekt, redelijke gelegenheid biedt een antwoord te geven alvorens het zijn besluit neemt. Wanneer dergelijke bezwaren aan het Comité zijn voorgelegd, moet een besluit ten aanzien van de opneming in de Lijst, onverminderd artikel 26, worden genomen met een meerderheid van vier vijfde van de aanwezige en hun stem uitbrengende leden van het Comité.   
6.   Bij het besluit over een verzoek dient het Comité het advies in te winnen van gouvernementele en niet-gouvernementele organisaties, alsmede van individuele deskundigen.   
7.   Een besluit tot verlening of weigering van verhoogde bescherming kan alleen worden genomen op basis van de in artikel 10 genoemde criteria.   
8.   In uitzonderlijke gevallen, wanneer het Comité tot de conclusie is gekomen dat de Partij die om opneming van cultuurgoederen in de Lijst heeft verzocht, niet kan voldoen aan de criteria van artikel 10, letter b, kan het Comité besluiten verhoogde bescherming toe te kennen, mits de verzoekende Partij een verzoek om internationale bijstand uit hoofde van artikel 32 indient.   
9.   Zodra de vijandelijkheden aanvangen kan een Partij bij het conflict, op grond van een noodgeval, verzoeken om verhoogde bescherming van cultuurgoederen die onder haar rechtsmacht of zeggenschap staan, door een verzoek bij het Comité in te dienen. Het Comité brengt dit verzoek onverwijld ter kennis van alle partijen bij het conflict. In dergelijke gevallen bestudeert het Comité de bezwaren van de betrokken partijen met spoed. Het besluit tot toekenning van voorlopige verhoogde bescherming wordt zo snel mogelijk genomen en, onverminderd artikel 26, met een meerderheid van vier vijfde van de aanwezige en hun stem uitbrengende leden van het Comité. Het Comité kan de verhoogde bescherming voorlopig toekennen, in afwachting van de uitkomst van de reguliere procedure voor de toekenning van verhoogde bescherming, mits wordt voldaan aan de bepalingen van artikel 10, letters a en c.   
10.   Verhoogde bescherming wordt door het Comité aan een cultuurgoed toegekend vanaf het moment dat het in de Lijst is opgenomen.   
11.   De Directeur-Generaal zendt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en alle Partijen onverwijld een kennisgeving van een besluit van het Comité tot opneming van cultuurgoederen in de Lijst.   

### Artikel  12  

####Onschendbaarheid van cultuurgoederen onder verhoogde bescherming

De partijen bij een conflict waarborgen de onschendbaarheid van cultuurgoederen die onder verhoogde bescherming zijn geplaatst door zich te onthouden van iedere verwording van deze goederen tot aanvalsdoelen of van ieder gebruik van deze goederen of de onmiddellijke omgeving daarvan ter ondersteuning van militair optreden.  

### Artikel  13  

####Verlies van verhoogde bescherming

1.   Cultuurgoederen onder verhoogde bescherming verliezen deze bescherming uitsluitend: 

a. indien deze bescherming wordt geschorst of opgeheven in overeenstemming met artikel 14; of  

b. indien, en zolang als, het goed door het gebruik ervan een militair doel is geworden.     
2.   In de omstandigheden als bedoeld in het eerste lid, letter b, mag een dergelijk goed uitsluitend het voorwerp van een aanval vormen indien: 

a. de aanval de enige praktisch uitvoerbare wijze is om een einde te maken aan het in het eerste lid, letter b, bedoelde gebruik van het goed;  

b. alle praktisch uitvoerbare voorzorgen zijn getroffen bij de keuze van de middelen en -methoden voor de aanval, met het oog op het beëindigen van een dergelijk gebruik en het voorkomen, of in elk geval zoveel mogelijk beperken, van schade aan het culturele goed;  

c. tenzij de omstandigheden zulks niet toelaten, vanwege de noodzaak van onmiddellijke zelfverdediging: 

i. bevel tot aanvallen gegeven wordt op het hoogste operationele bevelsniveau;  

ii. aan de strijdkrachten van de tegenstander een doeltreffende vroegtijdige waarschuwing wordt gegeven waarin zij worden gemaand tot beëindiging van het in het eerste lid, letter b, bedoelde gebruik; en  

iii. aan de strijdkrachten van de tegenstander een redelijke termijn wordt verleend om de situatie te herstellen.       

### Artikel  14  

####Schorsing en opheffing van verhoogde bescherming

1.   Wanneer een cultuurgoed niet langer aan een van de in artikel 10 van dit Protocol genoemde criteria voldoet, kan het Comité de verhoogde bescherming ervan schorsen of opheffen door het culturele goed van de Lijst te verwijderen.   
2.   In geval van ernstige schending van artikel 12 met betrekking tot cultuurgoederen onder verhoogde bescherming als gevolg van het gebruik ervan ter ondersteuning van militair optreden, kan het Comité de verhoogde bescherming ervan schorsen. Wanneer deze schendingen voortdurend zijn, kan het Comité de bescherming van het genoemde goed bij wijze van uitzondering opheffen door het van de Lijst te verwijderen.   
3.   De Directeur-Generaal zendt de Secretaris-Generaal van de Verenigde Naties en alle Partijen bij dit Protocol onverwijld een kennisgeving van elk besluit van het Comité tot schorsing of opheffing van de verhoogde bescherming van cultuurgoederen.   
4.   Alvorens een dergelijk besluit te nemen, stelt het Comité de Partijen in de gelegenheid hun mening kenbaar te maken.   

### HOOFDSTUK  4  

####STRAFRECHTELIJKE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID EN RECHTSMACHT

### Artikel  15  

####Ernstige schendingen van dit Protocol

1.   Hij die opzettelijk en in strijd met het Verdrag of met dit Protocol één van de volgende handelingen verricht, begaat een strafbaar feit in het kader van dit Protocol: 

a. een cultuurgoed onder verhoogde bescherming het voorwerp van een aanval maken;  

b. een cultuurgoed onder verhoogde bescherming of de onmiddellijke omgeving daarvan gebruiken ter ondersteuning van militair optreden;  

c. het op grote schaal vernietigen of zich toe-eigenen van cultuurgoederen onder bescherming van het Verdrag en van dit Protocol;  

d. een cultuurgoed onder bescherming van het Verdrag en van dit Protocol het voorwerp van een aanval maken;  

e. diefstal, plundering of ontvreemding van, of daden van vandalisme gericht tegen cultuurgoederen onder bescherming van het Verdrag.     
2.   Elke Partij neemt de nodige maatregelen teneinde de in dit artikel bedoelde strafbare feiten in haar nationale recht aan te merken als misdrijven en op dergelijke strafbare feiten passende straffen te stellen. Hierbij eerbiedigen de Partijen de algemene rechtsbeginselen en het internationale recht, met inbegrip van de regels die de individuele strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid uitbreiden tot andere personen dan de rechtstreekse daders.   

### Artikel  16  

####Rechtsmacht

1.   Onverminderd het tweede lid treft elke Partij de nodige wettelijke maatregelen om haar rechtsmacht ten aanzien van de in artikel 15 bedoelde strafbare feiten in de volgende gevallen te vestigen: 

a. wanneer een dergelijk strafbaar feit is gepleegd op het grondgebied van die Staat;  

b. wanneer de vermoedelijke dader een onderdaan is van die Staat;  

c. in geval van strafbare feiten bedoeld in artikel 15, letters a tot en met c, wanneer de vermoedelijke dader zich op het grondgebied van die Staat bevindt.     
2.   Ten aanzien van de uitoefening van rechtsmacht en onverminderd artikel 28 van het Verdrag: 

a. laat dit Protocol de individuele strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid de uitoefening van rechtsmacht uit hoofde van mogelijk van toepassing zijnd nationaal en internationaal recht onverlet, en doet het geen afbreuk aan de uitoefening van rechtsmacht uit hoofde van het internationaal gewoonterecht;  

b. kunnen leden van de strijdkrachten en onderdanen van een Staat die geen Partij is bij dit Protocol, behoudens gevallen waarin een Staat die geen Partij is bij dit Protocol de bepalingen ervan, overeenkomstig artikel 3, tweede lid, aanvaardt en toepast, en behoudens ten aanzien van onderdanen die dienen bij de strijdkrachten van een Staat die wel Partij is bij dit Protocol, niet individueel strafrechtelijk aansprakelijk worden gesteld uit hoofde van dit Protocol, noch behelst dit Protocol enige verplichting tot vestiging van rechtsmacht over dergelijke personen of tot hun uitlevering.     

### Artikel  17  

####Vervolging

1.   De Partij op het grondgebied waarvan de vermoedelijke dader van een van de in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, genoemde strafbare feiten wordt aangetroffen, legt, indien zij deze persoon niet uitlevert, de zaak zonder enige uitzondering en zonder onnodige vertraging, voor aan haar bevoegde autoriteiten, voor vervolging in overeenstemming met haar nationale recht of, in voorzover van toepassing, met de desbetreffende regels van internationaal recht.   
2.   Onverminderd de desbetreffende regels van internationaal recht, voorzover van toepassing, wordt een ieder ten aanzien van wie een procedure plaatsvindt in verband met het Verdrag of dit Protocol, in alle fasen van de procedure, een eerlijke behandeling en een eerlijk proces gewaarborgd in overeenstemming met nationaal en internationaal recht en worden hem in geen geval minder gunstige waarborgen toegekend dan die welke in het internationale recht zijn voorzien.   

### Artikel  18  

####Uitlevering

1.   De in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, genoemde strafbare feiten worden geacht te vallen onder de uitleveringsdelicten in elk tussen de Partijen bestaand uitleveringsverdrag dat is gesloten vóór de inwerkingtreding van dit Protocol. De Partijen verplichten zich ertoe bedoelde strafbare feiten op te nemen in ieder uitleveringsverdrag dat in een later stadium tussen hen wordt gesloten.   
2.   Indien een Partij die uitlevering afhankelijk stelt van het bestaan van een verdrag, een verzoek om uitlevering ontvangt van een andere Partij waarmee zij geen uitleveringsverdrag heeft, kan de aangezochte Partij, indien zij dit verkiest, dit Protocol beschouwen als een juridische grondslag voor uitlevering ten aanzien van de strafbare feiten omschreven in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c.   
3.   Partijen die uitlevering niet afhankelijk stellen van het bestaan van een verdrag, erkennen de in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, omschreven strafbare feiten als uitleveringsdelicten, onverminderd de voorwaarden waarin het recht van de aangezochte Partij voorziet.   
4.   Voor uitlevering tussen Partijen worden de in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, omschreven strafbare feiten indien nodig beschouwd als niet alleen begaan op de plaats waar zij zijn gepleegd maar ook op het grondgebied van de Partijen die hun rechtsmacht hebben gevestigd overeenkomstig artikel 16, eerste lid.   

### Artikel  19  

####Wederzijdse rechtshulp

1.   De Partijen verlenen elkaar de ruimst mogelijke rechtshulp met betrekking tot onderzoeken, bij strafzaken en bij uitleveringsprocedures ten aanzien van de in artikel 15 omschreven strafbare feiten, met inbegrip van rechtshulp ter verkrijging van bewijs in hun bezit dat nodig is voor de procedure.   
2.   De Partijen komen hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van het eerste lid na in overeenstemming met de verdragen en regelingen inzake wederzijdse rechtshulp die tussen hen bestaan. Indien dergelijke verdragen of regelingen ontbreken, verlenen de Partijen elkaar rechtshulp overeenkomstig hun nationale recht.   

### Artikel  20  

####Weigeringsgronden

1.   Ten behoeve van uitlevering en wederzijdse rechtshulp zullen de strafbare feiten omschreven in respectievelijk artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, en artikel 15, niet worden beschouwd als politieke delicten, noch als met politieke delicten samenhangende delicten, noch als delicten ingegeven door politieke motieven. Dienovereenkomstig mag een verzoek om uitlevering of om wederzijdse rechtshulp op basis van dergelijke delicten niet worden geweigerd op grond van het enkele feit dat het een politiek delict, een met een politiek delict samenhangend delict of een delict ingegeven door politieke motieven betreft.   
2.   Niets in dit Protocol mag zo worden uitgelegd dat het verplicht tot uitlevering of het verlenen van wederzijdse rechtshulp in gevallen waarin de aangezochte Partij ernstige redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat het verzoek om uitlevering voor in artikel 15, eerste lid, letters a tot en met c, omschreven strafbare feiten of om wederzijdse rechtshulp met betrekking tot in artikel 15 genoemde strafbare feiten, is gedaan met de bedoeling een persoon te vervolgen of te bestraffen op grond van zijn ras, godsdienst, nationaliteit, etnische afkomst of politieke overtuiging, of dat inwilliging van het verzoek de positie van de betrokkene om één van deze redenen ongunstig zou kunnen beïnvloeden.   

### Artikel  21  

####Maatregelen met betrekking tot andere schendingen

Onverminderd artikel 28 van het Verdrag neemt elke Partij de wettelijke, bestuurlijke of disciplinaire maatregelen die nodig kunnen zijn voor het doen ophouden van de volgende handelingen wanneer deze opzettelijk worden verricht: 

a. elk gebruik van cultuurgoederen in strijd met het Verdrag of met dit Protocol;  

b. elke wederrechtelijke uitvoer, andere verplaatsing of eigendomsoverdracht van cultuurgoederen vanuit een bezet gebied, in strijd met het Verdrag of met dit Protocol.

####DE BESCHERMING VAN CULTUURGOEDEREN BIJ GEWAPENDE CONFLICTEN VAN NIET-INTERNATIONALE AARD

### Artikel  22  

####Gewapende conflicten van niet-internationale aard

1.   Dit Protocol is van toepassing in geval van een gewapend conflict van niet-internationale aard dat zich voordoet op het grondgebied van een van de Partijen.   
2.   Dit Protocol is niet van toepassing op situaties van interne ongeregeldheden en spanningen, zoals rellen, op zichzelf staande en sporadische daden van geweld en andere handelingen van soortgelijke aard.   
3.   Geen enkele bepaling van dit Protocol wordt ingeroepen met het oog op de aantasting van de soevereiniteit van een Staat of de verantwoordelijkheid van de regering om, met alle wettige middelen, de rechtsorde in de Staat te handhaven of te herstellen of de nationale eenheid en territoriale integriteit van de Staat te verdedigen.   
4.   Geen enkele bepaling van dit Protocol doet afbreuk aan de primaire rechtsmacht van een Partij op het grondgebied waarvan een gewapend conflict van niet-internationale aard zich voordoet ten aanzien van de in artikel 15 genoemde schendingen.   
5.   Geen enkele bepaling van dit Protocol wordt ingeroepen ter rechtvaardiging van, rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks ingrijpen, om welke reden dan ook, in het gewapend conflict of in de interne of externe aangelegenheden van de Partij op het grondgebied waarvan dat conflict zich voordoet.   
6.   De toepassing van dit Protocol op de in het eerste lid vermelde situatie is niet van invloed op de rechtspositie van de partijen bij het conflict.   
7.   De UNESCO kan haar diensten aanbieden aan de partijen bij het conflict.   

### HOOFDSTUK  6
