Elk verzoek, alsmede de bijgevoegde bescheiden, dienen wat betreft vorm en inhoud ten genoegen van de beheerder aan te tonen dat het gevraagde bedrag uitsluitend zal worden gebruikt voor de in deze Overeenkomst uiteengezette doeleinden, dat de goederen in verband waarmee de betaling wordt gevraagd in het kader van het project passen, en dat de kosten daarvan niet onredelijk hoog zijn.  

4.08. De beheerder kan betalingen doen of regelingen treffen voor betalingen hetzij rechtstreeks aan de leveranciers der goederen, hetzij aan anderen, zonder dat Laos daarom heeft verzocht, steeds wanneer hij, na overleg met Laos, beslist dat zulks noodzakelijk of wenselijk is met het oog op de doelmatige uitvoering van het project.  

4.09. Betalingen uit het Fonds dienen te geschieden in de door de beheerder aan te wijzen munteenheden.

### Artikel  V  

####De beheerder

5.01. De beheerder houdt, namens de Partijen die een bijdrage leveren en in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en de Project Overeenkomst, toezicht op de uitvoering van het project (met inbegrip van de aanschaffing van goederen en de coördinatie van de uitvoering van zowel de door het Fonds gefinancierde delen van het project als de door de bilaterale leningen gefinancierde delen van het project), beheert het Fonds en coördineert de naleving door de Partijen van hun onderscheiden verplichtingen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst en de Project Overeenkomst.  

5.02. De beheerder zendt binnen dertig (30) dagen na 30 juni 1974 en telkens na 30 juni en 31 december daarna aan elk der Partijen die een bijdrage levert, de Bilaterale Leners en Laos, een verslag met voldoende gegevens met betrekking tot de ontvangsten en uitgaven, alsmede het saldo van het Fonds, de vorderingen van het project, en andere aangelegenheden die verband houden met het Fonds, het project, deze Overeenkomst en de Project Overeenkomst.  

5.03. De beheerder kan, zonder daartoe verplicht te zijn, het Fonds, of een gedeelte daarvan, deponeren en beleggen, in afwachting van het tijdstip waarop dit wordt gebruikt, op zodanige wijze als het hem geschikt voorkomt. Tenzij een Partij die een bijdrage levert de beheerder een andere bestemming voor de inkomsten uit het deposito en de investering van de geldelijke bijdrage van die Partij aangeeft, worden de inkomsten uit deposito's en investeringen van het Fonds na aftrek van de daarmede verbandhoudende uitgaven en lasten, door de beheerder namens Laos als deel van de activa van het Fonds gehouden en beheerd.  

5.04. Telkens wanneer het voor de doeleinden van deze Overeenkomst noodzakelijk is een munteenheid uit te drukken in een andere munteenheid, wordt de waarde daarvan zo goed mogelijk vastgesteld door de beheerder in overeenstemming met de bij de Bank gebruikelijke procedures.  

5.05. De beheerder is niet aansprakelijk voor verliezen ten gevolge van schommelingen in wisselkoersen, die door het Fonds worden geleden bij koop en verkoop van verschillende munteenheden.  

5.06. Wanneer de Bank optreedt als beheerder dient zij dezelfde zorg te betrachten ten aanzien van het beheer en het bestuur van het Fonds en bij de uitoefening van haar andere functies ingevolge deze Overeenkomst en de Project Overeenkomst, als zij betracht ten aanzien van het beheer en het bestuur van haar eigen zaken.  

5.07. 

a) De beheerder ontvangt geen schadevergoeding voor ingevolge deze Overeenkomst door hem verleende diensten, maar krijgt de kosten voor alle door hem gedane uitgaven in verband met de verlening van zodanige diensten vergoed, met inbegrip van een voldoende deel van zijn vaste administratieve uitgaven.  

b) De beheerder berekent de som van zodanige uitgaven en debiteert daarvoor het Fonds ieder half jaar, met dien verstande dat de eerste berekening en betaling betrekking hebben op de- periode die eindigt op 30 juni 1974. Onverminderd andere bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, komen zodanige uitgaven halfjaarlijks in de eerste plaats ten laste van de inkomsten van het Fonds en voorts van alle bijdragen aan het Fonds in verhouding tot die bijdragen.    

5.08. Telkens wanneer de beheerder bepaalt dat bijzondere omstandigheden zulks vereisen, kan hij die overeenkomsten of regelingen treffen, of het treffen daarvan verlangen of goedkeuren, met adviseurs, aannemers en andere lichamen welke hij wenselijk acht ter uitvoering van het project op de meest doelmatige, snelle en kostenbesparende wijze.

6.02.

b) Paragraaf 6.02 (a) kan in geen enkel opzicht een belemmering vormen voor een Partij die een bijdrage levert of voor een Bilaterale Lener de betaling van zijn bijdrage aan het project op te schorten in geval van achterstallige betaling van de hoofdsom van, of rente of andere lasten over, een zodanige bijdrage.

c) wisselen op verzoek van een der beide partijen, Laos en de beheerder van tijd tot tijd door middel van hun vertegenwoordigers van gedachten over zaken welke verband houden met de uitvoering van het project, de doeleinden van deze Overeenkomst en in het bijzonder met (i) de nakoming door Laos van zijn verplichtingen ingevolge deze Overeenkomst en de Financieringsovereenkomst en (ii) de nakoming door de EDL van zijn verplichtingen ingevolge de Project Overeenkomst en de Financieringsovereenkomst.    

7.05. 

a) Laos stelt de vertegenwoordigers van de beheerder in staat het project en de met gelden van het Fonds en van de bilaterale leningen betaalde goederen te inspecteren en de daarop betrekking hebbende bescheiden en stukken in te zien.  

b) Laos stelt vertegenwoordigers van de beheerder zoveel als redelijkerwijze mogelijk is in staat ieder deel van het grondgebied van het Koninkrijk Laos te bezoeken voor doeleinden die verband houden met het project.

De beheerder kan zodanige overeenkomsten aangaan of regelingen treffen met Laos, de EDL of enig ander orgaan of andere organen van Laos die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de uitvoering van het project, als hij wenselijk acht voor de uitvoering van deze Overeenkomst. Laos verbindt zich zijn verplichtingen na te komen en er zorg voor te dragen dat de EDL en alle andere zodanige organen hun onderscheiden verplichtingen ingevolge elke zodanige overeenkomst of regeling nakomen.  

7.07. Laos neemt zijnerzijds alle noodzakelijke maatregelen om de EDL in staat te stellen zijn verplichtingen ingevolge de Project Overeenkomst na te komen, met inbegrip van de vaststelling en instandhouding van de in paragraaf 3.04 van die overeenkomst bedoelde tarieven, en mag geen handelingen verrichten noch toestaan die een belemmering zouden vormen voor de nakoming van die verplichtingen.

7.09. Tenzij de beheerder anders overeenkomt, treft Laos ten genoegen van de beheerder regelingen en zorgt voor de instandhouding daarvan: i) ten einde te verzekeren dat de invoer, de verwerving, de verkoop, het verbruik en de eigendom van goederen en de verlening van diensten bedoeld voor de uitvoering van het project, vrijgesteld zijn van alle belastingen en rechten; en ii) ten einde betalingen aan niet uit Laos afkomstige aannemers, leveranciers, adviseurs en andere organen die diensten verlenen voor het project, alsmede aan niet uit Laos afkomstige werknemers, vrij te stellen van inkomstenbelastingen en soortgelijke belastingen.

b) De beheerder draagt terstond na de beëindiging van zijn verplichtingen ingevolge paragraaf 10.03 (a) alle tegoeden die op dat lik het saldo vormen van het Fonds over aan die persoon of dat lichaam welke Laos en een bijzondere meerderheid der Partijen die een bijdrage leveren zullen aanwijzen aan de beheerder voor de toepassing van deze paragraaf.

10.04. In de paragrafen 10.02 en 10.03 wordt onder „een bijzondere meerderheid van de Partijen die een bijdrage leveren” verstaan een meerderheid van die Partijen die een bijdrage leveren, wier bijdragen meer dan twee derden van het totale bedrag der bijdragen aan het Fonds vormen.
