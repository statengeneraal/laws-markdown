####Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade

The Parties to this Convention, Aware of the harmful impact on human health and the environment from certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, Recalling the pertinent provisions of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and chapter 19 of Agenda 21 on “Environmentally sound management of toxic chemicals, including prevention of illegal international traffic in toxic and dangerous products", Mindful of the work undertaken by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the operation of the voluntary Prior Informed Consent procedure, as set out in the UNEP Amended London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade (hereinafter referred to as the “Amended London Guidelines") and the FAO International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides (hereinafter referred to as the “International Code of Conduct"), Taking into account the circumstances and particular requirements of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, in particular the need to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for the management of chemicals, including transfer of technology, providing financial and technical assistance and promoting cooperation among the Parties, Noting the specific needs of some countries for information on transit movements, Recognizing that good management practices for chemicals should be promoted in all countries, taking into account, *inter alia*, the voluntary standards laid down in the International Code of Conduct and the UNEP Code of Ethics on the International Trade in Chemicals, Desiring to ensure that hazardous chemicals that are exported from their territory are packaged and labelled in a manner that is adequately protective of human health and the environment, consistent with the principles of the Amended London Guidelines and the International Code of Conduct, Recognizing that trade and environmental policies should be mutually supportive with a view to achieving sustainable development, Emphasizing that nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as implying in any way a change in the rights and obligations of a Party under any existing international agreement applying to chemicals in international trade or to environmental protection, Understanding that the above recital is not intended to create a hierarchy between this Convention and other international agreements, Determined to protect human health, including the health of consumers and workers, and the environment against potentially harmful impacts from certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

####Objective

The objective of this Convention is to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties.  

### Article  2  

####Definitions

For the purposes of this Convention: 

a) “Chemical" means a substance whether by itself or in a mixture or preparation and whether manufactured or obtained from nature, but does not include any living organism. It consists of the following categories: pesticide (including severely hazardous pesticide formulations) and industrial;  

b) “Banned chemical" means a chemical all uses of which within one or more categories have been prohibited by final regulatory action, in order to protect human health or the environment. It includes a chemical that has been refused approval for first-time use or has been withdrawn by industry either from the domestic market or from further consideration in the domestic approval process and where there is clear evidence that such action has been taken in order to protect human health or the environment;  

c) “Severely restricted chemical" means a chemical virtually all use of which within one or more categories has been prohibited by final regulatory action in order to protect human health or the environment, but for which certain specific uses remain allowed. It includes a chemical that has, for virtually all use, been refused for approval or been withdrawn by industry either from the domestic market or from further consideration in the domestic approval process, and where there is clear evidence that such action has been taken in order to protect human health or the environment;  

d) “Severely hazardous pesticide formulation" means a chemical formulated for pesticidal use that produces severe health or environmental effects observable within a short period of time after single or multiple exposure, under conditions of use;  

e) “Final regulatory action" means an action taken by a Party, that does not require subsequent regulatory action by that Party, the purpose of which is to ban or severely restrict a chemical;  

f) “Export" and “import" mean, in their respective connotations, the movement of a chemical from one Party to another Party, but exclude mere transit operations;  

g) “Party" means a State or regional economic integration organization that has consented to be bound by this Convention and for which the Convention is in force;

### Artikel  20  

####Regeling van geschillen

1.  Ingeval tussen Partijen een geschil ontstaat betreffende de interpretatie of de toepassing van dit Verdrag, trachten de betrokken Partijen dit geschil te regelen door middel van onderhandelingen of op een andere door henzelf te kiezen vreedzame wijze.   
2.  Bij de bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van dit Verdrag dan wel bij de toetreding hiertoe of op een later tijdstip kan een Partij die geen regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, verklaren, door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Depositaris, dat zij ten aanzien van een geschil betreffende de interpretatie of de toepassing van het Verdrag één van beide of beide hierna te noemen middelen voor geschillenbeslechting als dwingend aanvaardt ten aanzien van elke Partij die dezelfde verplichting op zich neemt: 

a. zodra dit praktisch uitvoerbaar is, arbitrage in overeenstemming met de in een bijlage beschreven, door de Conferentie van de Partijen goed te keuren procedures; en  

b. voorlegging van het geschil aan het Internationale Gerechtshof.     
3.  Een Partij die een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie is, kan een verklaring van gelijke strekking afleggen met betrekking tot arbitrage overeenkomstig de in het tweede lid, onder a), bedoelde procedure.   
4.  Een op grond van het tweede lid afgelegde verklaring blijft van kracht totdat deze overeenkomstig de daarin vermelde voorwaarden verstreken is, of tot drie maanden na indiening van de schriftelijke kennisgeving van herroeping bij de Depositaris.   
5.  Het verstrijken van een verklaring, een kennisgeving van herroeping of een nieuwe verklaring heeft hoe dan ook geen gevolgen voor geschillen die reeds bij een scheidsgerecht of bij het Internationale Gerechtshof aanhangig zijn gemaakt, tenzij de Partijen bij het geschil anders overeenkomen.   
6.  Indien de Partijen bij een geschil niet dezelfde of geen enkele procedure als bedoeld in het tweede lid hebben aanvaard, en indien zij er niet in geslaagd zijn hun geschil te regelen binnen twaalf maanden na de kennisgeving van de ene Partij aan de andere dat tussen hen een geschil bestaat, wordt het geschil op verzoek van één van de betrokken Partijen aan een verzoeningscommissie voorgelegd. De verzoeningscommissie brengt een rapport uit met aanbevelingen. Uiterlijk bij de tweede vergadering van de Conferentie van de Partijen worden aanvullende procedures met betrekking tot de verzoeningscommissie opgenomen in een door de Conferentie van de Partijen goedgekeurde bijlage.   

### Artikel  21  

####Wijzigingen van het Verdrag

1.  Wijzigingen van dit Verdrag kunnen door elke Partij worden voorgesteld.   
2.  Wijzigingen van dit Verdrag worden aangenomen op een Vergadering van de Conferentie van de Partijen. De tekst van voorgestelde wijzigingen van dit Verdrag wordt uiterlijk zes maanden vóór de vergadering waarop zij ter aanneming worden voorgelegd, door het Secretariaat aan de Partijen meegedeeld. Voorgestelde wijzigingen worden door het Secretariaat tevens toegezonden aan de ondertekenaars van dit Verdrag en, ter kennisgeving, aan de Depositaris.   
3.  De Partijen stellen alles in het werk om over elke voorgestelde wijziging van dit Verdrag consensus te bereiken. Indien alle pogingen om tot consensus te komen mislukken en geen overeenstemming is bereikt, wordt de wijziging in laatste instantie aangenomen met een meerderheid van drie vierde van de op de vergadering aanwezige en hun stem uitbrengende Partijen.   
4.  De wijziging wordt door de Depositaris aan de Partijen voorgelegd ter bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring.   
5.  De bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van wijzigingen wordt schriftelijk meegedeeld aan de Depositaris. Overeenkomstig het in het derde lid aangenomen wijzigingen worden voor de Partijen die deze hebben aanvaard, van kracht negentig dagen nadat de akten van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring door ten minste drie vierde van de Partijen zijn ingediend. Daarna worden de wijzigingen voor elke andere Partij van kracht op de negentigste dag na de datum waarop die Partij haar akte van bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van die wijzigingen heeft ingediend.   

### Artikel  22  

####Aanneming en wijziging van bijlagen

1.  De bijlagen bij dit Verdrag maken een integrerend deel uit van het Verdrag en een verwijzing naar het Verdrag vormt tegelijkertijd een verwijzing naar de bijlagen daarbij, tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald.   
2.  De bijlagen hebben uitsluitend betrekking op aangelegenheden van procedurele, wetenschappelijke, technische of administratieve aard.   
3.  De volgende procedure is van toepassing op het voorstellen, de aanneming en de inwerkingtreding van aanvullende bijlagen bij dit Verdrag:

####Criteria voor de vermelding van verboden of aan strenge beperkingen onderworpen chemische stoffen in Bijlage III 

Bij de beoordeling van de kennisgevingen die het Secretariaat op grond van artikel 5, vijfde lid, aan de Commissie ter beoordeling van chemische stoffen heeft toegezonden, wordt door deze Commissie: 

a. bevestigd dat de definitieve regelgeving is vastgesteld ter bescherming van de gezondheid van de mens of van het milieu;  

b. aangetoond dat de definitieve regelgeving op een risicoanalyse berust. Deze analyse is gebaseerd op een beoordeling van wetenschappelijke gegevens in de context van de omstandigheden bij de betrokken Partij. Daarom moet uit de verstrekte documenten blijken dat: 

i. de gegevens verkregen zijn volgens wetenschappelijk erkende methodes;  

ii. de gegevens geanalyseerd en gedocumenteerd zijn volgens algemeen erkende wetenschappelijke principes en procedures;  

iii. de definitieve regelgeving gebaseerd is op een risicoanalyse waarbij rekening is gehouden met de omstandigheden bij de betrokken Partij.    

c. overwogen of de definitieve regelgeving een voldoende brede basis biedt om de chemische stof in Bijlage III op te nemen, door na te gaan of: 

i. de definitieve regelgeving tot een significante vermindering van het gebruik van de chemische stof of van het aantal toepassingen ervan heeft geleid, dan wel naar verwachting daartoe zal leiden;  

ii. de definitieve regelgeving tot een werkelijke verkleining van het risico heeft geleid, dan wel verwacht wordt dat het voor de Partij die de kennisgeving heeft ingediend, in een significante verkleining van het risico voor de gezondheid van de mens of voor het milieu zal resulteren;  

iii. de overwegingen die aan de definitieve regelgeving ten grondslag liggen, alleen in een beperkt geografisch gebied gelden of in andere gelimiteerde omstandigheden;  

iv. kan worden aangetoond dat de chemische stof momenteel in het internationale handelsverkeer aanwezig is;    

d. er rekening mee gehouden dat opzettelijk misbruik op zichzelf niet voldoende reden is om een chemische stof in Bijlage III op te nemen.

####Regels inzake arbitrage

De arbitrageprocedure voor de toepassing van artikel 20, tweede lid, onderdeel a, van het Verdrag van Rotterdam inzake de procedure met betrekking tot voorafgaande geïnformeerde toestemming ten aanzien van bepaalde gevaarlijke chemische stoffen en pesticiden in de internationale handel luidt als volgt: 

### Artikel  1  

1.  Een Partij kan een arbitrageprocedure in overeenstemming met artikel 20 van het Verdrag instellen door middel van een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de andere partij bij het geschil. De kennisgeving dient vergezeld te gaan van een verklaring omtrent de vordering tezamen met stukken ter ondersteuning en dient het onderwerp van arbitrage te omschrijven, in het bijzonder met inbegrip van de artikelen van het Verdrag waarvan de interpretatie of toepassing ter discussie staat.   
2.  De eiser stelt het secretariaat ervan in kennis dat de partijen een geschil ingevolge artikel 20 voorleggen voor arbitrage. De schriftelijke kennisgeving van de eiser dient vergezeld te gaan van de verklaring omtrent de vordering en de stukken ter ondersteuning bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel. Het secretariaat zendt de aldus ontvangen informatie naar alle Partijen.   

### Artikel  2  

1.  Voor geschillen tussen twee Partijen wordt een scheidsgerecht ingesteld. Het scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden.   
2.  Elk van de partijen bij het geschil benoemt een arbiter en de twee aldus benoemde arbiters wijzen met gezamenlijke instemming de derde arbiter aan, die voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht wordt. De voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht mag geen onderdaan van een van de partijen bij het geschil zijn, noch mag hij of zij zijn of haar gewone verblijfplaats op het grondgebied van een van die partijen hebben, of in dienst zijn bij een van hen, of in een andere hoedanigheid reeds bij de aangelegenheid betrokken zijn geweest.   
3.  Bij geschillen tussen meer dan twee Partijen, benoemen Partijen met hetzelfde belang in gezamenlijke overeenstemming een arbiter.   
4.  Vacatures worden vervuld op de wijze voorgeschreven voor de oorspronkelijke benoeming.   
5.  Indien de partijen geen overeenstemming bereiken over het onderwerp van het geschil voordat de voorzitter van het scheidsgerecht is aangewezen, stelt het scheidsgerecht het onderwerp van het geschil vast.   

### Artikel  3
