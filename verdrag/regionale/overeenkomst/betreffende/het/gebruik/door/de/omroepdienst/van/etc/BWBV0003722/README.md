The delegates of the following Members of the International Telecommunication Union:  *Republic of Afghanistan, Algeria (Algerian Democratic and Popular Republic), Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, People's Republic of Bangladesh, Belgium, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, People's Republic of Bulgaria, Republic of Burundi, Republic of Cyprus, Vatican City State, Denmark, Finland, France, Republic of Upper Volta, Hungarian People's Republic, Iran, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, State of Kuwait, Kingdom of Lesotho, Lebanon, Republic of Liberia, Principality of Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malawi, Monaco, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Norway, Kingdom of the Netherlands, People's Republic of Poland, Portugal, German Democratic Republic, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Socialist Republic of Roumania, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sweden, Confederation of Switzerland, Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Togolese Republic, Tunisia, Turkey, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen*  meeting in Geneva for the Regional Administrative LF/MF Broadcasting Conference (Regions 1 and 3), Geneva, 1975, convened in accordance with the provisions of the International Telecommunication Convention (Malaga-Torremolinos, 1973),    *take note of the following:*      

1. by virtue of No. 185 of the Radio Regulations, Austria may keep the broadcasting station Innsbruck in the band 515-525 kHz provided that it does not cause harmful interference to the maritime mobile service;  

2. for many years a synchronized network of three transmitters each of 10 kW carrier power and four transmitters of very low power have been recorded in the Master International Frequency Register on behalf of Austria on the express condition, as specified in No. 115 of the Radio Regulations, that no harmful interference is caused to services carried out by stations operating in accordance with the provisions of the Convention; the use of these transmitters on the frequency 520 kHz with a bandwidth greater than 9 kHz has not given rise to complaint;  

3. Austria proposes to change the carrier frequency of the assignment in this band to the nearest multiple of 9 kHz (522 kHz) for the sake of compatibility with the channelling plan adopted by this Conference, to reduce the radiation bandwidth to 9 kHz and to increase the power of the Innsbruck station from 10 to 30 kW. It is proposed that such changes should come into force on 23 November 1978 at 0001 hours (GMT);  

4. for the proposed stations on frequency 522 kHz coordination in relation only to other stations of the broadcasting service has been carried out by applying all the technical criteria adopted by this Conference (with the exception of the value of the carrier frequency). The resulting characteristics of the proposed stations on frequency 522 kHz are shown in the Annex;  

5. the provisions of this Additional Protocol in no way affect the status of the stations concerned with respect to stations of the other radiocommunication services to which the frequency band 515-525 kHz is allocated and the provisions of Nos. 185 and 115 of the Radio Regulations still apply;  

6. the provisions of this Additional Protocol in no way prejudge any decisions which the World Administrative Radio Conference scheduled for 1979 may make concerning No. 185 of the Radio Regulations.
