(ii).  To enable the Fund to conduct its operations and transactions, the Fund shall maintain a General Department and a Special Drawing Rights Department. Membership in the Fund shall give the right to participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department.   
(iii).  Operations and transactions authorized by this Agreement shall be conducted through the General Department, consisting in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement of the General Resources Account, the Special Disbursement Account, and the Investment Account; except that operations and transactions involving special drawing rights shall be conducted through the Special Drawing Rights Department.   

### Article  I  

####Purposes

The purposes of the International Monetary Fund are: 

(i) To promote international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems.  

(ii) To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy.  

(iii) To promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements among members, and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.  

(iv) To assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of payments in respect of current transactions between members and in the elimination of foreign exchange restrictions which hamper the growth of world trade.  

(v) To give confidence to members by making the general resources of the Fund temporarily available to them under adequate safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity.  

(vi) In accordance with the above, to shorten the duration and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members.   The Fund shall be guided in all its policies and decisions by the purposes set forth in this Article.  

### Article  II  

####Membership

Section 1. *Original members* The original members of the Fund shall be those of the countries represented at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference whose governments accept membership before December 31, 1945. Section 2. *Other members* Membership shall be open to other countries at such times and in accordance with such terms as may be prescribed by the Board of Governors. These terms, including the terms for subscriptions, shall be based on principles consistent with those applied to other countries that are already members.  

### Article  III  

####Quotas and Subscriptions

Section 1. *Quotas and payment of subscriptions* Each member shall be assigned a quota expressed in special drawing rights. The quotas of the members represented at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference which accept membership before December 31, 1945 shall be those set forth in Schedule A. The quotas of other members shall be determined by the Board of Governors. The subscription of each member shall be equal to its quota and shall be paid in full to the Fund at the appropriate depository. Section 2. *Adjustment of quotas* 

(a) The Board of Governors shall at intervals of not more than five years conduct a general review, and if it deems it appropriate propose an adjustment, of the quotas of the members. It may also, if it thinks fit, consider at any other time the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.  

(b) The Fund may at any time propose an increase in the quotas of those members of the Fund that were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date in a cumulative amount not in excess of amounts transferred under Article V, Section 12 (f) (i) and (j) from the Special Disbursement Account to the General Resources Account.  

(c) An eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any change in quotas.  

(d) The quota of a member shall not be changed until the member has consented and until payment has been made unless payment is deemed to have been made in accordance with Section 3 (b) of this Article.   Section 3. *Payments when quotas are changed* 

(a) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2 (a) of this Article shall, within a period determined by the Fund, pay to the Fund twenty-five percent of the increase in special drawing rights, but the Board of Governors may prescribe that this payment may be made, on the same basis for all members, in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified; with their concurrence, by the Fund, or in the member's own currency. A non-participant shall pay in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund, with their concurrence, a proportion of the increase corresponding to the proportion to be paid in special drawing rights by participants. The balance of the increase shall be paid by the member in its own currency. The Fund's holdings of a member's currency shall not be increased above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Article V, Section 8 (b) (ii), as a result of payments by other members under this provision.  

(b) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2 (b) of this Article shall be deemed to have paid to the Fund an amount of subscription equal to such increase.  

(c) If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, within sixty days, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduction. The payment shall be made in the member's currency and in such amount of special drawing rights or the currencies of other members specified, with their concurrence, by the Fund as is necessary to prevent the reduction of the Fund's holdings of the currency below the new quota, provided that in exceptional circumstances the Fund may reduce its holdings of the currency below the new quota by payment to the member in its own currency.  

(d) A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any decision under (a) above, except for the determination of a period and the specification of currencies under that provision.   Section 4. *Substitution of securities for currency* The Fund shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the member's currency in the General Resources Account which in the judgment of the Fund is not needed for its operations and transactions, notes or similar obligations issued by the member or the depository designated by the member under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be non-negotiable, non-interest bearing and payable at their face value on demand by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated depository. This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund and to be placed in the General Resources Account.  

### Article  IV  

####Obligations Regarding Exchange Arrangements

Section 1. *General obligations of members* Recognizing that the essential purpose of the international monetary system is to provide a framework that facilitates the exchange of goods, services, and capital among countries, and that sustains sound economic growth, and that a principal objective is the continuing development of the orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for financial and economic stability, each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates. In particular, each member shall: 

(i) endeavor to direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability, with due regard to its circumstances;  

(ii) seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and a monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions;  

(iii) avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members; and  

(iv) follow exchange policies compatible with the undertakings under this Section.   Section 2. *General exchange arrangements* 

(a) Each member shall notify the Fund, within thirty days after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, of the exchange arrangements it intends to apply in fulfillment of its obligations under Section 1 of this Article, and shall notify the Fund promptly of any changes in its exchange arrangements.  

(b) Under an international monetary system of the kind prevailing on January 1, 1976, exchange arrangements may include (i) the maintenance by a member of a value for its currency in terms of the special drawing right or another denominator, other than gold, selected by the member, or (ii) cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, or (iii) other exchange arrangements of a member's choice.  

(c) To accord with the development of the international monetary system, the Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may make provision for general exchange arrangements without limiting the right of members to have exchange arrangements of their choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and the obligations under Section 1 of this Article.   Section 3. *Surveillance over exchange arrangements* 

(a) The Fund shall oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation, and shall oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations under Section 1 of this Article.  

(b) In order to fulfill its functions under (a) above, the Fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies. Each member shall provide the Fund with the information necessary for such surveillance, and, when requested by the Fund, shall consult with it on the member's exchange rate policies. The principles adopted by the Fund shall be consistent with cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, as well as with other exchange arrangements of a member's choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and Section 1 of this Article. These principles shall respect the domestic social and political policies of members, and in applying these principles the Fund shall pay due regard to the circumstances of members.   Section 4. *Par values* The Fund may determine, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, that international economic conditions permit the introduction of a widespread system of exchange arrangements based on stable but adjustable par values. The Fund shall make the determination on the basis of the underlying stability of the world economy, and for this purpose shall take into account price movements and rates of expansion in the economies of members. The determination shall be made in light of the evolution of the international monetary system, with particular reference to sources of liquidity, and, in order to ensure the effective operation of a system of par values, to arrangements under which both members in surplus and members in deficit in their balances of payments take prompt, effective, and symmetrical action to achieve adjustment, as well as to arrangements for intervention and the treatment of imbalances. Upon making such determination, the Fund shall notifiy members that the provisions of Schedule C apply. Section 5. *Separate currencies within a member's territories* 

(a) Action by a member with respect to its currency under this Article shall be deemed to apply to the separate currencies of all territories in respect of which the member has accepted this Agreement under Article XXXI, Section 2 (g) unless the member declares that its action relates either to the metropolitan currency alone, or only to one or more specified separate currencies, or to the metropolitan currency and one or more specified separate currencies.  

(b) Action by the Fund under this Article shall be deemed to relate to all currencies of a member referred to in (a) above unless the Fund declares otherwise.    

### Article  V  

####Operations and Transactions of the Fund

Section 1. *Agencies dealing with the Fund* Each member shall deal with the Fund only through its Treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency, and the Fund shall deal only with or through the same agencies. Section 2. *Limitation on the Fund's operations and transactions* 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, transactions on the account of the Fund shall be limited to transactions for the purpose of supplying a member, on the initiative of such member, with special drawing rights or the currencies of other members from the general resources of the Fund, which shall be held in the General Resources Account, in exchange for the currency of the member desiring to make the purchase.  

(b) If requested, the Fund may decide to perform financial and technical services, including the administration of resources contributed by members, that are consistent with the purposes of the Fund. Operations involved in the performance of such financial services shall not be on the account of the Fund. Services under this subsection shall not impose any obligation on a member without its consent.   Section 3. *Conditions governing use of the Fund's general resources* 

(a) The Fund shall adopt policies on the use of its general resources, including policies on stand-by or similar arrangements, and may adopt special policies for special balance of payments problems, that will assist members to solve their balance of payments problems in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that will establish adequate safeguards for the temporary use of the general resources of the Fund.  

(b) A member shall be entitled to purchase the currencies of other members from the Fund in exchange for an equivalent amount of its own currency subject to the following conditions: 

(i) the member's use of the general resources of the Fund would be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the policies adopted under them;  

(ii) the member represents that it has a need to make the purchase because of its balance of payments or its reserve position or developments in its reserves;  

(iii) the proposed purchase would be a reserve tranche purchase, or would not cause the Fund's holdings of the purchasing member's currency to exceed two hundred percent of its quota;  

(iv) the Fund has not previously declared under Section 5 of this Article, Article VI, Section 1, or Article XXVI, Section 2 (a) that the member desiring to purchase is ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund.    

(c) The Fund shall examine a request for a purchase to determine whether the proposed purchase would be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and the policies adopted under them, provided that requests for reserve tranche purchases shall not be subject to challenge.  

(d) The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures on the selection of currencies to be sold that take into account, in consultation with members, the balance of payments and reserve position of members and developments in the exchange markets, as well as the desirability of promoting over time balanced positions in the Fund, provided that if a member represents that it is proposing to purchase the currency of another member because the purchasing member wishes to obtain an equivalent amount of its own currency offered by the other member, it shall be entitled to purchase the currency of the other member unless the Fund has given notice under Article VII, Section 3 that its holdings of the currency have become scarce.  

(e) 

(i) Each member shall ensure that balances of its currency purchased form the Fund are balances of a freely usable currency or can be exchanged at the time of purchase for a freely usable currency of its choice at an exchange rate between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7 (a).  

(ii) Each member whose currency is purchased from the Fund or is obtained in exchange for currency purchased from the Fund shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable such balances of its currency to be exchanged, at the time of purchase, for the freely usable currencies of other members.  

(iii) An exchange under (i) above of a currency that is not freely usable shall be made by the member whose currency is purchased unless that member and the purchasing member agree on another procedure.  

(iv) A member purchasing from the Fund the freely usable currency of another member and wishing to exchange it at the time of purchase for another freely usable currency shall make the exchange with the other member if requested by that member. The exchange shall be made for a freely usable currency selected by the other member at the rate of exchange referred to in (i) above.    

(f) Under policies and procedures which it shall adopt, the Fund may agree to provide a participant making a purchase in accordance with this Section with special drawing rights instead of the currencies of other members.   Section 4. *Waiver of conditions* The Fund may in its discretion, and on terms which safeguard its interests, waive any of the conditions prescribed in Section 3 (b) (iii) and (iv) of this Article, especially in the case of members with a record of avoiding large or continuous use of the Fund's general resources. In making a waiver it shall take into consideration periodic or exceptional requirements of the member requesting the waiver. The Fund shall also take into consideration a member's willingness to pledge as collateral security acceptable assets having a value sufficient in the opinion of the Fund to protect its interests and may require as a condition of waiver the pledge of such collateral security. Section 5. *Ineligibility to use the Fund's general resources* Whenever the Fund is of the opinion that any member is using the general resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the purposes of the Fund, it shall present to the member a report setting forth the views of the Fund and prescribing a suitable time for reply. After presenting such a report to a member, the Fund may limit the use of its general resources by the member. If no reply to the report is received from the member within the prescribed time, or if the reply received is unsatisfactory, the Fund may continue to limit the member's use of the general resources of the Fund or may, after giving reasonable notice to the member, declare it ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund. Section 6. *Other purchases and sales of special drawing rights by the Fund* 

(a) The Fund may accept special drawing rights offered by a participant in exchange for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members.  

(b) The Fund may provide a participant, at its request, with special drawing rights for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members. The Fund's holdings of a member's currency shall not be increased as a result of these transactions above the level at which the holdings would be subject to charges under Section 8 (b) (ii) of this Article.  

(c) The currencies provided or accepted by the Fund under this Section shall be selected in accordance with policies that take into account the principles of Section 3 (d) or 7 (i) of this Article. The Fund may enter into transactions under this Section only if a member whose currency is provided or accepted by the Fund concurs in that use of its currency.   Section 7. *Repurchase by a member of its currency held by the Fund* 

(a) A member shall be entitled to repurchase at any time the Fund's holdings of its currency that are subject to charges under Section 8 (b) of this Article.  

(b) A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article will be expected normally, as its balance of payments and reserve position improves, to repurchase the Fund's holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8 (b) of this Article. A member shall repurchase these holdings if, in accordance with policies on repurchase that the Fund shall adopt and after consultation with the member, the Fund represents to the member that it should repurchase because of an improvement in its balance of payments and reserve position.  

(c) A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article shall repurchase the Fund's holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8 (b) of this Article not later than five years after the date on which the purchase was made. The Fund may prescribe that repurchase shall be made by a member in installments during the period beginning three years and ending five years after the date of a purchase. The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may change the periods for repurchase under this subsection, and any period so adopted shall apply to all members.  

(d) The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt periods other than those that apply in accordance with (c) above, which shall be the same for all members, for the repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the Fund pursuant to a special policy on the use of its general resources.  

(e) A member shall repurchase, in accordance with policies that the Fund shall adopt by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, the Fund's holdings of its currency that are not acquired as a result of purchases and are subject to charges under Section 8 (b) (ii) of this Article.  

(f) A decision prescribing that under a policy on the use of the general resources of the Fund the period for repurchase under (c) or (d) above shall be shorter than the one in effect under the policy shall apply only to holdings acquired by the Fund subsequent to the effective date of the decision.  

(g) The Fund, on the request of a member, may postpone the date of discharge of a repurchase obligation, but not beyond the maximum period under (c) or (d) above or under policies adopted by the Fund under (e) above, unless the Fund determines, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, that a longer period for repurchase which is consistent with the temporary use of the general resources of the Fund is justified because discharge on the due date would result in exceptional hardship for the member.  

(h) The Fund's policies under Section 3 (d) of this Article may be supplemented by policies under which the Fund may decide after consultation with a member to sell under Section 3 (b) of this Article its holdings of the member's currency that have not been repurchased in accordance with this Section 7, without prejudice to any action that the Fund may be authorized to take under any other provision of this Agreement.  

(i) All repurchases under this Section shall be made with special drawing rights or with the currencies of other members specified by the Fund. The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures with regard to the currencies to be used by members in making repurchases that take into account the principles in Section 3 (d) of this Article. The Fund's holdings of a member's currency that is used in repurchase shall not be increased by the repurchase above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (b) (ii) of this Article.  

(j) 

(i) If a member's currency specified by the Fund under (i) above is not a freely usable currency, the member shall ensure that the repurchasing member can obtain it at the time of the repurchase in exchange for a freely usable currency selected by the member whose currency has been specified. An exchange of currency under this provision shall take place at an exchange rate between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7 (a).  

(ii) Each member whose currency is specified by the Fund for repurchase shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable repurchasing members, at the time of the repurchase, to obtain the specified currency in exchange for the freely usable currencies of other members.  

(iii) An exchange under (j) (i) above shall be made with the member whose currency is specified unless that member and the repurchasing member agree on another procedure.  

(iv) If a repurchasing member wishes to obtain, at the time of the repurchase, the freely usable currency of another member specified by the Fund under (i) above, it shall, if requested by the other member, obtain the currency from the other member in exchange for a freely usable currency at the rate of exchange referred to in (j) (i) above. The Fund may adopt regulations on the freely usable currency to be provided in an exchange.     Section 8. *Charges* 

(a) 

(i) The Fund shall levy a service charge on the purchase by a member of special drawing rights or the currency of another member held in the General Resources Account in exchange for its own currency, provided that the Fund may levy a lower service charge on reserve tranche purchases than on other purchases. The service charge on reserve tranche purchases shall not exceed one-half of one percent.  

(ii) The Fund may levy a charge for stand-by or similar arrangements. The Fund may decide that the charge for an arrangement shall be offset against the service charge levied under (i) above on purchases under the arrangement.    

(b) The Fund shall levy charges on its average daily balances of a member's currency held in the General Resources Account to the extent that they 

(i) have been acquired under a policy that has been the subject of an exclusion under Article XXX (c), or  

(ii) exceed the amount of the member's quota after exclusing any balances referred to in (i) above.   The rates of charge normally shall rise at intervals during the period in which balances are held.  

(c) If a member fails to make a repurchase required under Section 7 of this Article, the Fund, after consultation with the member on the reduction of the Fund's holdings of its currency, may impose such charges as the Fund deems appropriate on its holdings of the member's currency that should have been repurchased.  

(d) A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for the determination of the rates of charge under (a) and (b) above, which shall be uniform for all members, and under (c) above.  

(e) A member shall pay all charges in special drawing rights, provided that in exceptional circumstances the Fund may permit a member to pay charges in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund, after consultation with them, or in its own currency. The Fund's holdings of a member's currency shall not be increased as a result of payments by other members under this provision above the level at which they would be subject to charges under (b) (ii) above.   Section 9. *Remuneration* 

(a) The Fund shall pay remuneration on the amount by which the percentage of quota prescribed under (b) or (c) below exceeds the Fund's average daily balances of a member's currency held in the General Resources Account other than balances acquired under a policy that has been the subject of an exclusion under Article XXX (c). The rate of remuneration, which shall be determined by the Fund by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, shall be the same for all members and shall be not more than, nor less than four-fifths of, the rate of interest under Article XX, Section 3. In establishing the rate of remuneration, the Fund shall take into account the rates of charge under Article V, Section 8 (b).  

(b) The percentage of quota applying for the purposes of (a) above shall be: 

(i) for each member that became a member before the second amendment of this Agreement, a percentage of quota corresponding to seventy-five percent of its quota on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, and for each member that became a member after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, a percentage of quota calculated by dividing the total of the amounts corresponding to the percentages of quota that apply to the other members on the date on which the member became a member by the total of the quotas of the other members on the same date; plus  

(ii) the amounts it has paid to the Fund in currency or special drawing rights under Article III, Section 3 (a) since the date applicable under (b) (i) above; and minus  

(iii) the amounts it has received from the Fund in currency or special drawing rights under Article III, Section 3 (c) since the date applicable under (b) (i) above.    

(c) The Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may raise the latest percentage of quota applying for the purposes of (a) above to each member to: 

(i) a percentage, not in excess of one hundred percent, that shall be determined for each member on the basis of the same criteria for all members, or  

(ii) one hundred percent for all members.    

(d) Remuneration shall be paid in special drawing rights, provided that either the Fund or the member may decide that the payment to the member shall be made in its own currency.   Section 10. *Computations* 

(a) The value of the Fund's assets held in the accounts of the General Department shall be expressed in terms of the special drawing right.  

(b) All computations relating to currencies of members for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement, except Article IV and Schedule C, shall be at the rates at which the Fund accounts for these currencies in accordance with Section 11 of this Article.  

(c) Computations for the determination of amounts of currency in relation to quota for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement shall not include currency held in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account.   Section 11. *Maintenance of value*

(b) An adjustment in the Fund's holdings of a member's currency pursuant to this Section shall be made on the occasion of the use of that currency in an operation or transaction between the Fund and another member and at such other times as the Fund may decide or the member may request. Payments to or by the Fund in respect of an adjustment shall be made within a reasonable time, as determined by the Fund, after the date of adjustment, and at any other time requested by the member.   Section 12. *Other operations and transactions* 

(a) The Fund shall be guided in all its policies and decisions under this Section by the objectives set forth in Article VIII, Section 7 and by the objective of avoiding the management of the price, or the establishment of a fixed price, in the gold market.  

(b) Decisions of the Fund to engage in operations or transactions under (c), (d), and (e) below shall be made by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power.  

(c) The Fund may sell gold for the currency of any member after consulting the member for whose currency the gold is sold, provided that the Fund's holdings of a member's currency held in the General Resources Account shall not be increased by the sale above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (b) (ii) of this Article without the concurrence of the member, and provided that, at the request of the member, the Fund at the time of sale exchange for the currency of another member such part of the currency received as would prevent such an increase. The exchange of a currency for the currency of another member shall be made after consultation with that member, and shall not increase the Fund's holdings of that member's currency above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (b) (ii) of this Article. The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures with regard to exchanges that take into account the principles applied under Section 7 (i) of this Article. Sales under this provision to a member shall be at a price agreed for each transaction on the basis of prices in the market.  

(d) The Fund may accept payments from a member in gold instead of special drawing rights or currency in any operations or transactions under this Agreement. Payments to the Fund under this provision shall be at a price agreed for each operation or transaction on the basis of prices in the market.  

(e) The Fund may sell gold held by it on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement to those members that were members on August 31, 1975 and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their quotas on that date. If the Fund intends to sell gold under (c) above for the purpose of (f) (ii) below, it may sell to each developing member that agrees to buy it that portion of the gold which, if sold under (c) above, would have produced the excess that could have been distributed to it under (f) (iii) below. The gold that would be sold under this provision to a member that has been declared ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall be sold to it when the ineligibility ceases, unless the Fund decides to make the sale sooner. The sale of gold to a member under this subsection (e) shall be made in exchange for its currency and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888671 gram of fine gold.  

(f) Whenever under (c) above the Fund sells gold held by it on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, an amount of the proceeds equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888671 gram of fine gold shall be placed in the General Resources Account and, except as the Fund may decide otherwise under (g) below, any excess shall be held in the Special Disbursement Account. The assets held in the Special Disbursement Account shall be held separately from the other accounts of the General Department, and may be used at any time: 

(i) to make transfers to the General Resources Account for immediate use in operations and transactions authorized by provisions of this Agreement other than this Section;  

(ii) for operations and transactions that are not authorized by other provisions of this Agreement but are consistent with the purposes of the Fund. Under this subsection (f) (ii) balance of payments assistance may be made available on special terms to developing members in difficult circumstances, and for this purpose the Fund shall take into account the level of per capita income;  

(iii) for distribution to those developing members that were members on August 31, 1975, in proportion to their quotas on that date, of such part of the assets that the Fund decides to use for the purposes of (ii) above as corresponds to the proportion of the quotas of these members on the date of distribution to the total of the quotas of all members on the same date, provided that the distribution under this provision to a member that has been declared ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall be made when the ineligibility ceases, unless the Fund decides to make the distribution sooner.   Decisions to use assets pursuant to (i) above shall be taken by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, and decisions pursuant to (ii) and (iii) above shall be taken by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power.  

(g) The Fund may decide, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, to transfer a part of the excess referred to in (f) above to the Investment Account for use pursuant to the provisions of Article XII, Section 6 (f).  

(h) Pending uses specified under (f) above, the Fund may use a member’s currency held in the Special Disbursement Account for investment as it may determine, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Fund by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power. The income of investment and interest received under (f)(ii) above shall be placed in the Special Disbursement Account.  

(i) The General Resources Account shall be reimbursed from time to time in respect of the expenses of administration of the Special Disbursement Account paid from the General Resources Account by transfers from the Special Disbursement Account on the basis of a reasonable estimate of such expenses.  

(j) The Special Disbursement Account shall be terminated in the event of the liquidation of the Fund and may be terminated prior to liquidation of the Fund by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power.

If any gold acquired by the Fund after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement is sold after April 7, 2008 but prior to the date of entry into force of this provision, then, upon the entry into force of this provision, and notwithstanding the limit set forth in Article XII, Section 6(f)(ii), the Fund shall transfer to the Investment Account from the General Resources Account an amount equal to the proceeds of such sale less (i) the acquisition price of the gold sold, and (ii) any amount of such proceeds in excess of the acquisition price that may have already been transferred to the Investment Account prior to the date of entry into force of this provision.    

### Article  VI  

####Capital Transfers

Section 1. *Use of the Fund's general resources for capital transfers* 

(a) A member may not use the Fund's general resources to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, and the Fund may request a member to exercise controls to prevent such use of the general resources of the Fund. If, after receiving such a request, a member fails to exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the member ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund.  

(b) Nothing in this Section shall be deemed: 

(i) to prevent the use of the general resources of the Fund for capital transactions of reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking, or other business; or  

(ii) to affect capital movements which are met out of a member's own resources, but members undertake that such capital movements will be in accordance with the purposes of the Fund.     Section 2. *Special provisions for capital transfers* A member shall be entitled to make reserve tranche purchases to meet capital transfers. Section 3. *Controls of capital transfers* Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movements, but no member may exercise these controls in a manner which will restrict payments for current transactions or which will unduly delay transfers of funds in settlement of commitments, except as provided in Article VII, Section 3 (b) and in Article XIV, Section 2.  

### Article  VII  

####Replenishment and Scarce Currencies

Section 1. *Measures to replenish the Fund's holdings of currencies* The Fund may, if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its holdings of any member's currency in the General Resources Account needed in connection with its transactions, take either or both of the following steps: 

(i) propose to the member that, on terms and conditions agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend its currency to the Fund or that, with the concurrence of the member, the Fund borrow such currency from some other source either within or outside the territories of the member, but no member shall be under any obligation to make such loans to the Fund or to concur in the borrowing of its currency by the Fund from any other source;  

(ii) require the member, if it is a participant, to sell its currency to the Fund for special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account, subject to Article XIX, Section 4. In replenishing with special drawing rights, the Fund shall pay due regard to the principles of designation under Article XIX, Section 5.   Section 2. *General scarcity of currency* If the Fund finds that a general scarcity of a particular currency is developing, the Fund may so inform members and may issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity and containing recommendations designed to bring it to an end. A representative of the member whose currency is involved shall participate in the preparation of the report. Section 3. *Scarcity of the Fund's holdings* 

(a) If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a member's currency seriously threatens the Fund's ability to supply that currency, the Fund, whether or not it has issued a report under Section 2 of this Article, shall formally declare such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing supply of the scarce currency with due regard to the relative needs of members, the general international economic situation, and any other pertinent considerations. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.  

(b) A formal declaration under (a) above shall operate as an authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency. Subject to the provisions of Article IV and Schedule C, the member shall have complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary to limit the demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or accruing to, the member in question, and they shall be relaxed and removed as rapidly as conditions permit.  

(c) The authorization under (b) above shall expire whenever the Fund formally declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce.   Section 4. *Administration of restrictions* Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency of any other member pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (b) of this Article shall give sympathetic consideration to any representations by the other member regarding the administration of such restrictions. Section 5. *Effect of other international agreements on restrictions* Members agree not to invoke the obligations of any engagements entered into with other members prior to this Agreement in such a manner as will prevent the operation of the provisions of this Article.

If such arrangements and practices are engaged in at the date when this Agreement enters into force, the member concerned shall consult with the Fund as to their progressive removal unless they are maintained or imposed under Article XIV, Section 2, in which case the provisions of Section 3 of that Article shall apply. Section 4. *Convertibility of foreign-held balances*

(b) The obligation in (a) above shall not apply when: 

(i) the convertibility of the balances has been restricted consistently with Section 2 of this Article or Article VI, Section 3;

(b) In requesting information the Fund shall take into consideration the varying ability of members to furnish the data requested. Members shall be under no obligation to furnish information in such detail that the affairs of individuals or corporations are disclosed. Members undertake, however, to furnish the desired information in as detailed and accurate a manner as is practicable and, so far as possible, to avoid mere estimates.  

(c) The Fund may arrange to obtain further information by agreement with members. It shall act as a centre for the collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems, thus facilitating the preparation of studies designed to assist members in developing policies which further the purposes of the Fund.   Section 6. *Consultation between members regarding existing international agreements* Where under this, Agreement a member is authorized in the special or temporary circumstances specified in the Agreement to maintain or establish restrictions on exchange transactions, and there are other engagements between members entered into prior to this Agreement which conflict with the application of such restrictions, the parties to such engagements shall consult with one another with a view to making such mutually acceptable adjustments as may be necessary. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to the operation of Article VII, Section 5. Section 7. *Obligation to collaborate regarding policies on reserve assets* Each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund and with other members in order to ensure that the policies of the member with respect to reserve assets shall be consistent with the objectives of promoting better international surveillance of international liquidity and making the special drawing right the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system.

The number of Executive Directors in (ii) above shall be reduced by one or two, as the case may be, if Executive Directors are appointed under (c) below, unless the Board of Governors decides, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, that this reduction would hinder the effective discharge of the functions of the Executive Board or of Executive Directors or would threaten to upset a desirable balance in the Executive Board.  

(c) If, at the second regular election of Executive Directors and thereafter, the members entitled to appoint Executive Directors under (b) (i) above do not include the two members, the holdings of whose currencies by the Fund in the General Resources Account have been, on the average over the preceding two years, reduced below their quotas by the largest absolute amounts in terms of the special drawing right, either one or both of such members, as the case may be, may appoint an Executive Director.  

(d) Elections of elective Executive Directors shall be conducted at intervals of two years in accordance with the provisions of Schedule E, supplemented by such regulations as the Fund deems appropriate. For each regular election of Executive Directors, the Board of Governors may issue regulations making changes in the proportion of votes required to elect Executive Directors under the provisions of Schedule E.  

(e) Each Executive Director shall appoint an Alternate with full power to act for him when he is not present, provided that the Board of Governors may adopt rules enabling an Executive Director elected by more than a specified number of members to appoint two Alternates.

(d) In appointing the staff the Managing Director shall, subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and of technical competence, pay due regard to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible.   Section 5. *Voting* 

(a) The total votes of each member shall be equal to the sum of its basic votes and its quota-based votes.

Section 2. *Exchange restrictions* A member that has notified the Fund that it intends to avail itself of transitional arrangements under this provision may, notwithstanding the provisions of any other articles of this Agreement, maintain and adapt to changing circumstances the restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions that were in effect on the date on which it became a member. Members shall, however, have continuous regard in their foreign exchange policies to the purposes of the Fund, and, as soon as conditions permit, they shall take all possible measures to develop such commercial and financial arrangements with other members as will facilitate international payments and the promotion of a stable system of exchange rates.

####Allocation and Cancellation of Special Drawing Rights

Section 1. *Principles and considerations governing allocation and cancellation* 

(a) In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long-term global need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will avoid economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and inflation in the world.  

(b) The first decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take into account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there is a global need to supplement reserves, and the attainment of a better balance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better working of the adjustment process in the future.   Section 2. *Allocation and cancellation* 

(a) Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights shall be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall be five years in duration. The first basic period shall begin on the date of the first decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date as may be specified in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations shall take place at yearly intervals.  

(b) The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate. The rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be expressed as percentages of net cumulative allocations of special drawing rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages shall be the same for all participants.  

(c) In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide, notwithstanding (a) and (b) above, that: 

(i) the duration of the basic period shall be other than five years; or  

(ii) the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other than yearly intervals; or  

(iii) the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the quotas or net cumulative allocations on dates other than the dates of decisions to allocate or cancel.    

(d) A member that becomes a participant after a basic period starts shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic period in which allocations are made after it becomes a participant unless the Fund decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations beginning with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic period and the participant was not a member on the dates established under (b) or (c) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on which these allocations to the participant shall be made.  

(e) A participant shall receive allocations of special drawing rights made pursuant to any decision to allocate unless: 

(i) the Governor for the participant did not vote in favor of the decision; and  

(ii) the participant has notified the Fund in writing prior to the first allocation of special drawing rights under that decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to be allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a participant, the Fund may decide to terminate the effect of the notice with respect to allocations of special drawing rights subsequent to the termination.    

(f) on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of special drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of the special drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate its negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits and shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose. Special drawing rights acquired by the participant after the effective date of the cancellation shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled.   Section 3. *Unexpected major developments* The Fund may change the rates or intervals of allocation or cancellation during the rest of a basic period or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period, if at any time the Fund finds it desirable to do so because of unexpected major developments. Section 4. *Decisions on allocations and cancellations* 

(a) Decisions under Section 2 (a), (b), and (c) or Section 3 of this Article shall be made by the Board of Governors on the basis of proposals of the Managing Director concurred in by the Executive Board.  

(b) Before making any proposal, the Managing Director, after having satisfied himself that it will be consistent with the provisions of Section 1 (a) of this Article, shall conduct such consultations as will enable him to ascertain that there is broad support among participants for the proposal. In addition, before making a proposal for the first allocation, the Managing Director shall satisfy himself that the provisions of Section 1 (b) of this Article have been met and that there is broad support among participants to begin allocations; he shall make a proposal for the first allocation as soon after the establishment of the Special Drawing Rights Department as he is so satisfied.  

(c) The Managing Director shall make proposals: 

(i) not later than six months before the end of each basic period:  

(ii) if no decision has been taken with respect to allocation or cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisfied that the provisions of (b) above have been met;  

(iii) when, in accordance with Section 3 of this Article, he considers that it would be desirable to change the rate or intervals of allocation or cancellation or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period; or  

(iv) within six months of a request by the Board of Governors or the Executive Board;   provided that, if under (i), (iii), or (iv) above the Managing Director ascertains that there is no proposal which he considers to be consistent with the provisions of Section 1 of this Article that has broad support among participants in accordance with (b) above, he shall report to the Board of Governors and to the Executive Board.  

(d) An eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for decisions under Section 2 (a), (b), and (c) or Section 3 of this Article except for decisions under Section 3 with respect to a decrease in the rates of allocation.

(c) The Fund may waive the expectation in (a) above in any transactions in which a participant uses special drawing rights to obtain an equivalent amount of currency from a participant designated under Section 5 of this Article that would promote reconstitution by the other participant under Section 6 (a) of this Article, prevent or reduce a negative balance of the other participant; or offset the effect of a failure by the other participant to fulfill the expectation in (a) above.

Designations shall be made in accordance with the following general principles supplemented by such other princis the Fund may adopt from time to time: 

(i) A participant shall be subject to designation if its balance of payments and gross reserve position is sufficiently strong, but this will not preclude the possibility that a participant with a strong reserve position will be designated even though it has a moderate balance of payments deficit. Participants shall be designated in such manner as will promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of special drawing rights among them.  

(ii) Participants shall be subject to designation in order to promote reconstitution under Section 6 (a) of this Article, to reduce negative balances in holdings of special drawing rights, or to offset the effect of failures to fulfill the expectation in Section 3 (a) of this Article.  

(iii) In designating participants the Fund normally shall give priority to those that need to acquire special drawing rights to meet the objectives of designation under (ii) above.    

(b) In order to promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of special drawing rights under (a) (i) above, the Fund shall apply the rules for designation in Schedule F or such rules as may be adopted under (c) below.

(b) The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt policies under which in exceptional circumstances the Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may authorize participants entering into transactions under Section 2 (b) of this Article to agree on exchange rates other than those applicable under (a) above.

(i) the right to withdraw from the Fund (Article XXVI, Section 1);  

(ii) the provision that no change in a member's quota shall be made without its consent (Article III, Section 2 (d)); and

### Article  XXIX  

####Interpretation

(a).  Any question of interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement arising between any member and the Fund or between any members of the Fund shall be submitted to the Executive Board for its decision. If the question particularly affects any member not entitled to appoint an Executive Director, it shall be entitled to representation in accordance with Article XII, Section 3 (j).   
(b).  In any case where the Executive Board has given a decision under (a) above, any member may require, within three months from the date of the decision, that the question be referred to the Board of Governors, whose decision shall be final.

Pending the result of the reference to the Board of Governors the Fund may, so far as it deems necessary, act on the basis of the decision of the Executive Board.   
(c).  Whenever a disagreement arises between the Fund and a member which has withdrawn, or between the Fund and any member during liquidation of the Fund, such disagreement shall be submitted to arbitration by a tribunal of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Fund, another by the member or withdrawing member, and an umpire who, unless the parties otherwise agree, shall be appointed by the President of the International Court of Justice or such other authority as may have been prescribed by regulation adopted by the Fund. The umpire shall have full power to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties are in disagreement with respect thereto.

### Schedule  B  

####Transitional Provisions with Respect to Repurchase, Payment of Additional Subscriptions, Gold, and Certain Operational Matters

### 1  

Repurchase obligations that have accrued pursuant to Article V, Section 7 (b) before the date of the second amendment of this Agreement and that remain undischarged at that date shall be discharged not later than the date or dates at which the obligations had to be discharged in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement before the second amendment.  

### 2  

A member shall discharge with special drawing rights any obligation to pay gold to the Fund in repurchase or as a subscription that is outstanding at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, but the Fund may prescribe that these payments may be made in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund. A non-participant shall discharge an obligation that must be paid in special drawing rights pursuant to this provision with the currencies of other members specified by the Fund.  

### 3  

For the purposes of 2 above 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be equivalent to one special drawing right, and the amount of currency payable under 2 above shall be determined on that basis and on the basis of the value of the currency in terms of the special drawing right at the date of discharge.  

### 4  

A member's currency held by the Fund in excess of seventy-five percent of the member's quota at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement and not subject to repurchase under 1 above shall be repurchased in accordance with the following rules: 

(i) Holdings that resulted from a purchase shall be repurchased in accordance with the policy on the use of the Fund's general resources under which the purchase was made.  

(ii) Other holdings shall be repurchased not later than four years after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement.    

### 5  

Repurchases under 1 above that are not subject to 2 above, repurchases under 4 above, and any specification of currencies under 2 above shall be in accordance with Article V, Section 7 (i).  

### 6  

All rules and regulations, rates, procedures, and decisions in effect at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement shall remain in effect until they are changed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  

### 7  

To the extent that arrangements equivalent in effect to (a) and (b) below have not been completed before the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, the Fund shall 

(a) sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on August 31, 1975 to those members that were members on that date and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their quotas on that date. The sale to a member under this subparagraph (a) shall be made in exchange for its currency and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold, and  

(b) sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on August 31, 1975 for the benefit of developing members that were members on that date, provided, however, that the part of any profits or surplus value of the gold that corresponds to the proportion of such a member's quota on August 31, 1975 to the total of the quotas of all members on that date shall be transferred directly to each such member. The requirements under Article V, Section 12 (c) that the Fund consult a member, obtain a member's concurrence, or exchange a member's currency for the currencies of other members in certain circumstances shall apply with respect to currency received by the Fund as a result of sales of gold under this provision, other than sales to a member in return for its own currency, and placed in the General Resources Account.   Upon the sale of gold under this paragraph 7, an amount of the proceeds in the currencies received equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be placed in the General Resources Account and other assets held by the Fund under arrangements pursuant to (b) above shall be held separately from the general resources of the Fund. Assets that remain subject to disposition by the Fund upon termination of arrangements pursuant to (b) above shall be transferred to the Special Disbursement Account.  

### Schedule  C  

####Par Values

### 1  

The Fund shall notify members that par values may be established for the purposes of this Agreement, in accordance with Article IV, Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 and this Schedule, in terms of the special drawing right, or in terms of such other common denominator as is prescribed by the Fund. The common denominator shall not be gold or a currency.  

### 2  

A member that intends to establish a par value for its currency shall propose a par value to the Fund within a reasonable time after notice is given under 1 above.  

### 3  

Any member that does not intend to establish a par value for its currency under 1 above shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.  

### 4  

The Fund shall concur in or object to a proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. A proposed par value shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund objects to it, and the member shall be subject to 3 above. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the par value.  

### 5  

Each member that has a par value for its currency undertakes to apply appropriate measures consistent with this Agreement in order to ensure that the maximum and the minimum rates for spot exchange transactions taking place within its territories between its currency and the currencies of other members maintaining par values shall not differ from parity by more than four and one-half percent or by such other margin or margins as the Fund may adopt by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power.  

### 6  

A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its currency except to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental disequilibrium. A change may be made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the Fund.  

### 7  

When a change is proposed, the Fund shall concur in or object to the proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. The Fund shall concur if it is satisfied that the change is necessary to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental disequilibrium. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the change. A proposed change in par value shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund objects to it. If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2. Maintenance of an unrealistic par value by a member shall be discouraged by the Fund.  

### 8  

The par value of a member's currency established under this Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if the member informs the Fund that it intends to terminate the par value. The Fund may object to the termination of a par value by a decision taken by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power. If a member terminates a par value for its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2. A par value established under this Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if the member terminates the par value despite the objection of the Fund, or if the Fund finds that the member does not maintain rates for a substantial volume of exchange transactions in accordance with 5 above, provided that the Fund may not make such finding unless it has consulted the member and given it sixty days notice of the Fund's intention to consider whether to make a finding.  

### 9  

If the par value of the currency of a member has ceased to exist under 8 above, the member shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.  

### 10  

A member for whose currency the par value has ceased to exist under 8 above may, at any time, propose a new par value for its currency.  

### 11  

Notwithstanding 6 above, the Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may make uniform proportionate changes in all par values if the special drawing right is the common denominator and the changes will not affect the value of the special drawing right. The par value of a member's currency shall, however, not be changed under this provision if, within seven days after the Fund's action, the member informs the Fund that it does not wish the par value of its currency to be changed by such action.

(e).  For the purposes of (b) and 3 (b) above, an agreement under Article XII, Section 3 (i) (ii) by a member, or by a member that is a participant, shall entitle a Councillor to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to the member.   
(f).  When an Executive Director is entitled to cast the number of votes allotted to a member pursuant to Article XII, Section 3(i)(v), the Councillor appointed by the group whose members elected such Executive Director shall be entitled to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to such member. The member shall be deemed to have participated in the appointment of the Councillor entitled to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to the member.   

### 6  

The first sentence of Article XII, Section 2 (a) shall be deemed to include a reference to the Council.  

### Schedule  E  

####Election of Executive Directors

### 1  

The election of the elective Executive Directors shall be by ballot of the Governors eligible to vote.  

### 2  

In balloting for the Executive Directors to be elected, each of the Governors eligible to vote shall cast for one person all of the votes to which he is entitled under Article XII, Section 5 (a). The fifteen persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be Executive Directors, provided that no person who received less than four percent of the total number of votes that can be cast (eligible votes) shall be considered elected.  

### 3  

When fifteen persons are not elected in the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in which there shall vote only (a) those Governors who voted in the first ballot for a person not elected, and (b) those Governors whose votes for a person elected are deemed under 4 below to have raised the votes cast for that person above nine percent of the eligible votes. If in the second ballot there are more candidates than the number of Executive Directors to be elected, the person who received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot shall be ineligible for election.  

### 4  

In determining whether the votes cast by a Governor are to be deemed to have raised the total of any person above nine percent of the eligible votes the nine percent shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the Governor casting the largest number of votes for such person, then the votes of the Governor casting the next largest number, and so on until nine percent is reached.  

### 5  

Any Governor part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the total of any person above four percent shall be considered as casting all of his votes for such person even if the total votes for such person thereby exceed nine percent.  

### 6  

If, after the second ballot, fifteen persons have not been elected, further ballots shall be held on the same principles until fifteen persons have been elected, provided that after fourteen persons are elected, the fifteenth may be elected by a simple majority of the remaining votes and shall be deemed to have been elected by all such votes.  

### Schedule  F  

####Designation

During the first basic period the rules for designation shall be as follows: 

(a) Participants subject to designation under Article XIX, Section 5 (a) (i) shall be designated for such amounts as will promote over time equality in the ratios of the participants' holdings of special drawing rights in excess of their net cumulative allocations to their official holdings of gold and foreign exchange.  

(b) The formula to give effect to (a) above shall be such that participants subject to designation shall be designated: 

(i) in proportion to their official holdings of gold and foreign exchange when the ratios described in (a) above are equal; and  

(ii) in such manner as gradually to reduce the difference between the ratios described in (a) above that are low and the ratios that are high.       

### Schedule  G  

####Reconstruction

### 1  

During the first basic period the rules for reconstitution shall be as follows: 

(a) 

(i) A participant shall so use and reconstitute its holdings of special drawing rights that, five years after the first allocation and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter, the average of its total daily holdings of special drawing rights over the most recent five-year period will be not less than thirty percent of the average of its daily net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights over the same period.  

(ii) Two years after the first allocation and at the end of each calendar month thereafter the Fund shall make calculations for each participant so as to ascertain whether and to what extent the participant would need to acquire special drawing rights between the date of the calculation and the end of any five-year period in order to comply with the requirement in (a) (i) above. The Fund shall adopt regulations with respect to the bases on which these calculations shall be made and with respect to the timing of the designation of participants under Article XIX, Section 5 (a) (ii), in order to assist them to comply with the requirement in (a) (i) above.  

(iii) The Fund shall give special notice to a participant when the calculations under (a) (ii) above indicate that it is unlikely that the participant will be able to comply with the requirement in (a) (i) above unless it ceases to use special drawing rights for the rest of the period for which the calculation was made under (a) (ii) above.  

(iv) A participant that needs to acquire special drawing rights to fulfill this obligation shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them, for currency acceptable to the Fund, in a transaction with the Fund conducted through the General Resources Account. If sufficient special drawing rights to fulfill this obligation cannot be obtained in this way, the participant shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them with a freely usable currency from a participant which the Fund shall specify.    

(b) Participants shall also pay due regard to the desirability of pursuing over time a balanced relationship between their holdings of special drawing rights and their other reserves.    

### 2  

If a participant fails to comply with the rules for reconstitution, the Fund shall determine whether or not the circumstances justify suspension under Article XXIII, Section 2 (b).  

### Schedule  H  

####Termination of Participation

### 1  

If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV, Section 2 (b) is to the terminating participant and agreement on settlement between the Fund and the terminating participant is not reached within six months of the date of termination, the Fund shall redeem this balance of special drawing rights in equal half-yearly installments within a maximum of five years of the date of termination. The Fund shall redeem this balance as it may determine, either (a) by the payment to the terminating participant of the amounts provided by the remaining participants to the Fund in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 5, or (b) by permitting the terminating participant to use its special drawing rights to obtain its own currency or a freely usable currency from a participant specified by the Fund, the General Resources Account, or any other holder.  

### 2  

If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV, Section 2 (b) is to the Fund and agreement on settlement is not reached within six months of the date of termination, the terminating participant shall discharge this obligation in equal half-yearly installments within three years of the date of termination or within such longer period as may be fixed by the Fund. The terminating participant shall discharge this obligation, as the Fund may determine, either (a) by the payment to the Fund of a freely usable currency, or (b) by obtaining special drawing rights, in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 6, from the General Resources Account or in agreement with a participant specified by the Fund or from any other holder, and the setoff of these special drawing rights against the installment due.  

### 3  

Installments under either 1 or 2 above shall fall due six months after the date of termination and at intervals of six months thereafter.  

### 4  

In the event of the Special Drawing Rights Department going into liquidation under Article XXV within six months of the date a participant terminates its participation, the settlement between the Fund and that government shall be made in accordance with Article XXV and Schedule I.  

### Schedule  I  

####Administration of Liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department

### 1  

In the event of liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department, participants shall discharge their obligations to the Fund in ten half-yearly installments, or in such longer period as the Fund may decide is needed, in a freely usable currency and the currencies of participants holding special drawing rights to be redeemed in any installment to the extent of such redemption, as determined by the Fund. The first half-yearly payment shall be made six months after the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department.  

### 2  

If it is decided to liquidate the Fund within six months of the date of the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department, the liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department shall not proceed until special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account have been distributed in accordance with the following rule: After the distributions made under 2 (a) and (b) of Schedule K, the Fund shall apportion its special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account among all members that are participants in proportion to the amounts due to each participant after the distribution under 2 (b). To determine the amount due to each member for the purpose of apportioning the remainder of its holdings of each currency under 2 (d) of Schedule K, the Fund shall deduct the distribution of special drawing rights made under this rule.  

### 3  

With the amounts received under 1 above, the Fund shall redeem special drawing rights held by holders in the following manner and order: 

(a) Special drawing rights held by governments that have terminated their participation more than six months before the date the Board of Governors decides to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department shall be redeemed in accordance with the terms of any agreement under Article XXIV or Schedule H.  

(b) Special drawing rights held by holders that are not participants shall be redeemed before those held by participants, and shall be redeemed in proportion to the amount held by each holder.  

(c) The Fund shall determine the proportion of special drawing rights held by each participant in relation to its net cumulative allocation. The Fund shall first redeem special drawing rights from the participants with the highest proportion until this proportion is reduced to that of the second highest proportion; the Fund shall then redeem the special drawing rights held by these participants in accordance with their net cumulative allocations until the proportions are reduced to that of the third highest proportion; and this process shall be continued until the amount available for redemption is exhausted.    

### 4  

Any amount that a participant will be entitled to receive in redemption under 3 above shall be set off against any amount to be paid under 1 above.  

### 5  

During liquidation the Fund shall pay interest on the amount of special drawing rights held by holders, and each participant shall pay charges on the net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights to it less the amount of any payments made in accordance with 1 above. The rates of interest and charges and the time of payment shall be determined by the Fund. Payments of interest and charges shall be made in special drawing rights to the extent possible. A participant that does not hold sufficient special drawing rights to meet any charges shall make the payment with a currency specified by the Fund. Special drawing rights received as charges in amounts needed for administrative expenses shall not be used for the payment of interest, but shall be transferred to the Fund and shall be redeemed first and with the currencies used by the Fund to meet its expenses.  

### 6  

While a participant is in default with respect to any payment required by 1 or 5 above, no amounts shall be paid to it in accordance with 3 or 5 above.  

### 7  

If after the final payments have been made to participants each participant not in default does not hold special drawing rights in the same proportion to its net cumulative allocation, those participants holding a lower proportion shall purchase from those holding a higher proportion such amounts in accordance with arrangements made by the Fund as will make the proportion of their holdings of special drawing rights the same. Each participant in default shall pay to the Fund its own currency in an amount equal to its default. The Fund shall apportion this currency and any residual claims among participants in proportion to the amount of special drawing rights held by each and these special drawing rights shall be cancelled. The Fund shall then close the books of the Special Drawing Rights Department and all of the Fund's liabilities arising from the allocations of special drawing rights and the administration of the Special Drawing Rights Department shall cease.  

### 8  

Each participant whose currency is distributed to other participants under this Schedule guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for payments of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each participant so obligated agrees to compensate other participants for any loss resulting from the difference between the value at which the Fund distributed its currency under this Schedule and the value realized by such participants on disposal of its currency.  

### Schedule  J  

####Settlement of Accounts with Members Withdrawing

### 1  

The settlement of accounts with respect to the General Resources Account shall be made according to 1 to 6 of this Schedule. The Fund shall be obligated to pay to a member withdrawing an amount equal to its quota, plus any other amounts due to it from the Fund, less any amounts due to the Fund, including charges accruing after the date of its withdrawal; but no payment shall be made until six months after the date of withdrawal. Payments shall be made in the currency of the withdrawing member, and for this purpose the Fund may transfer to the General Resources Account holdings of the member's currency in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account in exchange for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members in the General Resources Account selected by the Fund with their concurrence.  

### 2  

If the Fund's holdings of the currency of the withdrawing member are not sufficient to pay the net amount due from the Fund, the balance shall be paid in a freely usable currency, or in such other manner as may be agreed. If the Fund and the withdrawing member do not reach agreement within six months of the date of withdrawal, the currency in question held by the Fund shall be paid forthwith to the withdrawing member. Any balance due shall be paid in ten half-yearly installments during the ensuing five years. Each such installment shall be paid, at the option of the Fund, either in the currency of the withdrawing member acquired after its withdrawal or in a freely usable currency.  

### 3  

If the Fund fails to meet any installment which is due in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the withdrawing member shall be entitled to require the Fund to pay the installment in any currency held by the Fund with the exception of any currency which has been declared scarce under Article VII, Section 3.  

### 4  

If the Fund's holdings of the currency of a withdrawing member exceed the amount due to it, and if agreement on the method of settling accounts is not reached within six months of the date of withdrawal, the former member shall be obligated to redeem such excess currency in a freely usable currency. Redemption shall be made at the rates at which the Fund would sell such currencies at the time of withdrawal from the Fund. The withdrawing member shall complete redemption within five years of the date of withdrawal, or within such longer period as may be fixed by the Fund, but shall not be required to redeem in any half-yearly period more than one-tenth of the Fund's excess holdings of its currency at the date of withdrawal plus further acquisitions of the currency during such half-yearly period. If the withdrawing member does not fulfill this obligation, the Fund may in an orderly manner liquidate in any market the amount of currency which should have been redeemed.  

### 5  

Any member desiring to obtain the currency of a member which has withdrawn shall acquire it by purchase from the Fund, to the extent that such member has access to the general resources of the Fund and that such currency is available under 4 above.  

### 6  

The withdrawing member guarantees the unrestricted use at all times of the currency disposed of under 4 and 5 above for the purchase of goods or for payment of sums due to it or to persons within its territories. It shall compensate the Fund for any loss resulting from the difference between the value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right on the date of withdrawal and the value realized in terms of the special drawing right by the Fund on disposal under 4 and 5 above.  

### 7  

If the withdrawing member is indebted to the Fund as the result of transactions conducted through the Special Disbursement Account under Article V, Section 12 (f) (ii), the indebtedness shall be discharged in accordance with the terms of the indebtedness.  

### 8  

If the Fund holds the withdrawing member's currency in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account, the Fund may in an orderly manner exchange in any market for the currencies of members the amount of the currency of the withdrawing member remaining in each account after use under 1 above, and the proceeds of the exchange of the amount in each account shall be kept in that account. Paragraph 5 above and the first sentence of 6 above shall apply to the withdrawing member's currency.  

### 9  

If the Fund holds obligations of the withdrawing member in the Special Disbursement Account pursuant to Article V, Section 12(h), or in the Investment Account, the Fund may hold them until the date of maturity or dispose of them sooner. Paragraph 8 above shall apply to the proceeds of such disinvestment.  

### 10  

In the event of the Fund going into liquidation under Article XXVII, Section 2 within six months of the date on which the member withdraws, the accounts between the Fund and that government shall be settled in accordance with Article XXVII, Section 2 and Schedule K.  

### Schedule  K  

####Administration of Liquidation

### 1  

In the event of liquidation the liabilities of the Fund other than the repayment of subscriptions shall have priority in the distribution of the assets of the Fund. In meeting each such liability the Fund shall use its assets in the following order: 

(a) the currency in which the liability is payable;  

(b) gold;  

(c) all other currencies in proportion, so far as may be practicable, to the quotas of the members.    

### 2  

After the discharge of the Fund's liabilities in accordance with 1 above, the balance of the Fund's assets shall be distributed and apportioned as follows: 

(a) 

(i) The Fund shall calculate the value of gold held on August 31, 1975 that it continues to hold on the date of the decision to liquidate. The calculation shall be made in accordance with 9 below and also on the basis of one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold on the date of liquidation. Gold equivalent to the excess of the former value over the latter shall be distributed to those members that were members on August 31,1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date.  

(ii) The Fund shall distribute any assets held in the Special Disbursement Account on the date of the decision to liquidate to those members that were members on August. 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date. Each type of asset shall be distributed proportionately to members.    

(b) The Fund shall distribute its remaining holdings of gold among the members whose currencies are held by the Fund in amounts less than their quotas in the proportions, but not in excess of, the amounts by which their quotas exceed the Fund's holdings of their currencies.  

(c) The Fund shall distribute to each member one-half the Fund's holdings of its currency but such distribution shall not exceed fifty percent of its quota.  

(d) The Fund shall apportion the remainder of its holdings of gold and each currency 

(i) among all members in proportion to, but not in excess of, the amounts due to each member after the distributions under (b) and (c) above, provided that distribution under 2 (a) above shall not be taken into account for determining the amounts due, and  

(ii) any excess holdings of gold and currency among all the members in proportion to their quotas.      

### 3  

Each member shall redeem the holdings of its currency apportioned to other members under 2 (d) above, and shall agree with the Fund within three months after a decision to liquidate upon an orderly procedure for such redemption.  

### 4  

If a member has not reached agreement with the Fund within the three-month period referred to in 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2 (d) above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other members. Each currency apportioned to a member which has not reached agreement shall be used, so far as possible, to redeem its currency apportioned to the members which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above.  

### 5  

If a member has reached agreement with the Fund in accordance with 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2 (d) above to redeem the currency that member apportioned to other members which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above. Each amount so redeemed shall be redeemd in the currency of the member to which it was apportioned.  

### 6  

After carrying out the steps in the preceding paragraphs, the Fund shall pay to each member the remaining currencies held for its account.  

### 7  

Each member whose currency has been distributed to other members under 6 above shall redeem such currency in the currency of the member requesting redemption, or in such other manner as may be agreed between them. If the members involved do not otherwise agree, the member obligated to redeem shall complete redemption within five years of the date of distribution, but shall not be required to redeem in any half-yearly period more than one-tenth of the amount distributed to each other member. If the member does not fulfill this obligation, the amount of currency which should have been redeemed may be liquidated in an orderly manner in any market.  

### 8  

Each member whose currency has been distributed to other members under 6 above guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for payment of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each member so obligated agrees to compensate other members for any loss resulting from the difference between the value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right on the date of the decision to liquidate the Fund and the value in terms of the special drawing right realized by such members on disposal of its currency.  

### 9  

The Fund shall determine the value of gold under this Schedule on the basis of prices in the market.  

### 10  

For the purposes of this Schedule, quotas shall be deemed to have been increased to the full extent to which they could have been increased in accordance with Article III, Section 2 (b) of this Agreement.

c) The Executive Director appointed or elected by the member, or in whose election the member has participated, shall cease to hold office, unless such Executive Director was entitled to cast the number of votes allotted to other members whose voting rights have not been suspended.

Deze voorwaarden, met inbegrip van de voorwaarden voor bijdragen, zijn gebaseerd op beginselen die verenigbaar zijn met die welke worden toegepast op andere landen die reeds lid zijn.  

### Artikel  III  

####Quota en bijdragen

Sectie 1. *Quota en betaling van bijdragen* Ieder lid krijgt een quotum toegewezen, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. De quota van de op de Monetaire en Financiële Conferentie der Verenigde Naties vertegenwoordigde leden die vóór 31 december 1945 het lidmaatschap aanvaarden, zijn die welke in Schema A zijn vermeld. De quota van andere leden worden vastgesteld door de Raad van Bestuur. De bijdrage van ieder lid dient gelijk te zijn aan zijn quotum en in haar geheel te worden betaald aan het Fonds bij de hiertoe aangewezen instantie van deponering. Sectie 2. *Aanpassing der quota* 

(a) De Raad van Bestuur onderwerpt met tussenpozen van niet langer dan vijf jaar de quota der leden aan een algemene beoordeling en stelt, indien hij dit wenselijk acht, aanpassing daarvan voor. Hij kan ook, indien hij dit juist acht, de aanpassing van elk bepaald quotum op verzoek van het betrokken lid op ieder ander tijdstip in overweging nemen.  

(b) Het Fonds kan te allen tijde een verhoging voorstellen van de quota van die leden van het Fonds die lid waren op 31 augustus 1975, zulks naar verhouding van hun quota op die datum en tot een cumulatief bedrag dat niet hoger is dan de bedragen die krachtens het bepaalde in artikel V, sectie 12 (f) (i) en (j) worden overgemaakt van de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening naar de Algemene Middelenrekening.  

(c) Een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal is nodig voor enige wijziging in de quota.  

(d) Het quotum van een lid wordt eerst gewijzigd wanneer het lid hiermee heeft ingestemd en betaling heeft plaatsgevonden, tenzij betaling wordt geacht te zijn verricht in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in sectie 3 (b) van dit artikel.   Sectie 3. *Betalingen indien quota worden gewijzigd* 

(a) Ieder lid dat instemt met een verhoging van zijn quotum krachtens het bepaalde in sectie 2 (a) van dit artikel, betaalt binnen een door het Fonds bepaald tijdvak vijfentwintig procent van de verhoging in bijzondere trekkingsrechten aan het Fonds, maar de Raad van Bestuur kan voorschrijven dat deze betaling, op dezelfde basis voor alle leden, geheel of gedeeltelijk kan worden verricht in de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden, zulks met hun instemming, of in de valuta van het lid zelf. Een niet-participant dient in de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden, met hun instemming, een percentage van de verhoging te betalen dat overeenkomt met het percentage dat door participanten dient te worden betaald in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Het resterende deel van de verhoging dient door het lid te worden voldaan in zijn eigen valuta. Het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid mag niet, als gevolg van betalingen door andere leden uit hoofde van deze bepaling, hoger worden dan het niveau waarboven ingevolge artikel V, sectie 8 (b) (ii) provisies zouden worden geheven.  

(b) Ieder lid dat instemt met een verhoging van zijn quotum krachtens het bepaalde in sectie 2 (b) van dit artikel, wordt geacht aan het Fonds als bijdrage een bedrag te hebben betaald, gelijk aan een zodanige verhoging.  

(c) Indien een lid met een verlaging van zijn quotum instemt, betaalt het Fonds binnen zestig dagen aan het lid een bedrag gelijk aan de verlaging uit. De betaling wordt verricht in de valuta van het lid en tot zulk een bedrag aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten of in de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden, met hun instemming, als nodig is om te voorkomen dat het bezit van het Fonds aan die valuta daalt tot onder het nieuwe quotum, met dien verstande dat het Fonds in uitzonderlijke omstandigheden zijn bezit aan de valuta kan verlagen tot onder het nieuwe quotum door betaling aan het lid in zijn eigen valuta.  

(d) Een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal is nodig voor enigerlei besluit uit hoofde van het bepaalde in (a) van deze sectie, met uitzondering van het vaststellen van een tijdvak en het specificeren van valuta's ingevolge die bepaling.   Sectie 4. *Vervanging van valuta door waardepapieren* Het Fonds neemt van ieder lid in plaats van enig deel van de bijdrage in de eigen valuta van het lid aan de Algemene Middelenrekening, dat het Fonds naar zijn mening niet voor zijn verrichtingen en transacties nodig heeft, promessen of gelijksoortige schuldbekentenissen aan, uitgegeven door het lid of door de instantie van deponering, die door het lid ingevolge artikel XIII, sectie 2 aangewezen is. Deze waardepapieren zijn niet overdraagbaar, dragen geen rente en zijn op aanvraag tegen hun nominale waarde aflosbaar door creditering van de rekening van het Fonds bij de aangewezen instantie van deponering. Deze sectie is niet alleen van toepassing op de eigen valuta's tot betaling waarvan de leden zich hebben verbonden, maar ook op iedere valuta die uit anderen hoofde aan het Fonds is verschuldigd of door het Fonds is verkregen en die moet worden geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening.  

### Artikel  IV  

####Verplichtingen ten aanzien van wisselkoers-arrangementen

Sectie 1. *Algemene verplichtingen van leden* Erkennende dat het wezenlijke doel van het internationale monetaire stelsel is het bieden van een kader ter vergemakkelijking van het verkeer van goederen, diensten en kapitaal tussen landen en ter ondersteuning van een gezonde economische groei, en dat een hoofddoel is de voortgaande ontwikkeling van de ordelijke basisvoorwaarden die nodig zijn voor financiële en economische stabiliteit, verbindt ieder lid zich samen te werken met het Fonds en met de andere leden, om ordelijke wisselkoers-arrangementen te verzekeren en een stabiel stelsel van wisselkoersen te bevorderen. In het bijzonder zal ieder lid: 

(i) trachten zijn economische en financiële beleid te richten op het aanmoedigen van een ordelijke economische groei met een redelijke prijsstabiliteit, naar behoren rekening houdend met zijn omstandigheden;  

(ii) ernaar streven stabiliteit te bevorderen door het aanmoedigen van ordelijke economische en financiële basisvoorwaarden en van een monetair stelsel waarin geen erratische storingen optreden;  

(iii) niet overgaan tot manipulaties met de wisselkoersen of het internationale monetaire stelsel om een doeltreffende aanpassing van de betalingsbalans te verhinderen of een oneerlijk concurrentievoordeel te verkrijgen ten opzichte van andere leden; en  

(iv) een wisselkoersbeleid voeren dat verenigbaar is met de uit deze sectie voortvloeiende verbintenissen.   Sectie 2. *Algemene wisselkoers-arrangementen* 

(a) Ieder lid stelt, binnen dertig dagen na de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, het Fonds in kennis van de wisselkoers-arrangementen die het voornemens is toe te passen bij de nakoming van de krachtens sectie 1 van dit artikel op hem rustende verplichtingen en stelt het Fonds onverwijld in kennis van eventuele veranderingen in zijn wisselkoers-arrangementen.  

(b) In een internationaal monetair stelsel van het type zoals dit bestond op 1 januari 1976, kunnen wisselkoers-arrangementen omvatten: (i) de handhaving door een lid van een waarde voor zijn valuta uitgedrukt in het bijzondere trekkingsrecht of een andere eenheid, anders dan goud, die door het lid is gekozen, of (ii) samenwerkingsovereenkomsten door middel waarvan de leden de waarde van hun valuta's handhaven ten opzichte van de waarde van de valuta of valuta's van andere leden, of (iii) andere wisselkoers-arrangementen naar keuze van een lid.  

(c) Het Fonds kan, om aan te sluiten bij de ontwikkeling van het internationale monetaire stelsel, met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal voorzien in algemene wisselkoersarrangementen, zonder het recht van de leden te beperken op wisselkoersarrangementen naar eigen keuze die verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds en de verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit sectie 1 van dit artikel.   Sectie 3. *Toezicht op wisselkoers-arrangementen* 

(a) Het Fonds houdt toezicht op het internationale monetaire stelsel ten einde de doeltreffende werking hiervan te verzekeren, en ziet erop toe dat ieder lid zich houdt aan de verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit sectie 1 van dit artikel.  

(b) Ten einde zijn onder letter (a) van deze sectie bedoelde functies te vervullen, oefent het Fonds strikt toezicht uit op het wisselkoersbeleid van de leden en stelt het specifieke beginselen vast als richtsnoer voor alle leden waar het dit beleid betreft. Ieder lid verschaft het Fonds de gegevens die nodig zijn voor een zodanig toezicht en pleegt, op verzoek van het Fonds, hiermede overleg over zijn wisselkoersbeleid. De door het Fonds vastgestelde beginselen dienen verenigbaar te zijn met de samenwerkingsovereenkomsten door middel waarvan de leden de waarde van hun valuta's handhaven ten opzichte van de waarde van de valuta of valuta's van andere leden, alsmede met andere wisselkoers-arrangementen naar keuze van een lid die verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds en met sectie 1 van dit artikel. Deze beginselen laten het binnenlandse sociale en politieke beleid van de leden onverlet en bij het toepassen van deze beginselen dient het Fonds naar behoren de omstandigheden van de leden in acht te nemen.   Sectie 4. *Pari-waarden* Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal bepalen dat de internationale economische situatie van dien aard is dat een wijd vertakt stelsel van wisselkoers-arrangementen op basis van stabiele, doch aanpasbare pari-waarden kan worden ingevoerd. Het Fonds bepaalt dit op basis van de fundamentele stabiliteit van de wereldeconomie en het houdt hiertoe rekening met ontwikkelingen in de prijzen en de groei van de economie van de leden. Het Fonds baseert zijn oordeel op de ontwikkeling van het internationale monetaire stelsel, daarbij in het bijzonder gelet op de herkomst van liquide middelen en, ten einde de doeltreffende werking van een stelsel van pari-waarden te verzekeren, gelet op regelingen krachtens welke zowel leden met een overschot, als die met een tekort op hun betalingsbalans onverwijld doeltreffende symmetrische maatregelen nemen om te komen tot een aanpassing, en tevens gelet op regelingen ten behoeve van interventie en de behandeling van onevenwichtigheden. Wanneer het Fonds tot dit oordeel is gekomen, brengt het de leden ter kennis dat het bepaalde in schema C van toepassing is. Sectie 5. *Verschillende valuta's binnen het grondgebied van een lid* 

(a) Wanneer een lid uit hoofde van dit artikel maatregelen neemt ten aanzien van zijn valuta, worden deze geacht van toepassing te zijn op de afzonderlijke valuta's van alle grondgebieden waarvoor het lid deze Overeenkomst krachtens artikel XXXI, sectie 2 (g), heeft aanvaard, tenzij het lid verklaart dat zijn maatregelen van toepassing zijn op hetzij uitsluitend de valuta van het moederland, hetzij een of meer nader aangeduide afzonderlijke valuta's, dan wel op de valuta van het moederland en een of meer nader aangeduide afzonderlijke valuta's.  

(b) Indien het Fonds maatregelen neemt krachtens dit artikel, worden deze geacht betrekking te hebben op alle valuta's van een lid, zoals bedoeld in letter (a) van deze sectie, tenzij het Fonds anders verklaart.    

### Artikel  V  

####Verrichtingen en transacties van het Fonds

Sectie 1. *Instanties die met het Fonds in verbinding kunnen treden* Ieder lid treedt slechts in verbinding met het Fonds door middel van zijn Ministerie van Financiën, Centrale Bank, egalisatiefonds of andere soortgelijke met de schatkist in verband staande instantie, terwijl het Fonds slechts met of door middel van dezelfde instanties met de leden in verbinding treedt. Sectie 2. *Beperking van de verrichtingen en transacties van het Fonds* 

(a) Tenzij in deze Overeenkomst anders is bepaald, blijven de transacties voor rekening van het Fonds beperkt tot transacties, die ten doel hebben aan een lid, op diens verlangen, bijzondere trekkingsrechten of de valuta's van andere leden uit de algemene middelen van het Fonds, geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening, te verstrekken, in ruil voor de valuta van het lid dat de aankoop wenst te doen.  

(b) Op verzoek kan het Fonds besluiten financiële en technische diensten te verlenen, waaronder begrepen de administratie van door leden bijgedragen middelen, die verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds. Verrichtingen die te maken hebben met de uitvoering van zodanige financiële diensten komen niet voor rekening van het Fonds. Diensten uit hoofde van deze alinea leggen geen enkele verplichting op aan een lid zonder diens toestemming.   Sectie 3. *Voorwaarden, die het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds beheersen* 

(a) Het Fonds stelt een beleid vast ten aanzien van het gebruik van zijn algemene middelen, waaronder begrepen een beleid inzake bijstandsarrangementen of soortgelijke arrangementen, en kan een speciaal beleid vaststellen voor bijzondere betalingsbalans vraagstukken, dat de leden helpt bij het oplossen van hun betalingsbalansvraagstukken, op een wijze die verenigbaar is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, en dat toereikende waarborgen biedt voor het tijdelijk gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds.  

(b) Een lid heeft het recht onder de volgende voorwaarden de valuta's van andere leden te kopen van het Fonds in ruil voor een equivalent bedrag aan zijn eigen valuta: 

(i) dat het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds door een lid in overeenstemming is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en het krachtens deze bepalingen vastgestelde beleid;  

(ii) dat het lid verklaart dat hij de aankoop moet doen om wille van zijn betalingsbalans of zijn reservepositie dan wel ontwikkelingen in zijn reserves;  

(iii) dat de voorgestelde aankoop een aankoop in de reservetranche is, of er niet toe zou leiden dat het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van het kopende lid meer zou gaan bedragen dan 200 procent van zijn quotum;  

(iv) dat het Fonds niet krachtens sectie 5 van dit artikel, artikel VI, sectie 1, of artikel XXVI, sectie 2(a), op een eerder tijdstip heeft verklaard dat het lid dat de aankoop wenst te doen onbevoegd is tot het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds.    

(c) Het Fonds onderzoekt een verzoek tot aankoop om te bepalen of de voorgestelde aankoop verenigbaar is met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en het krachtens deze bepalingen vastgestelde beleid, met dien verstande dat verzoeken om aankopen in de reservetranche niet op bezwaren zullen stuiten.  

(d) Het Fonds stelt een beleid en procedures vast ten aanzien van de keuze van de te verkopen valuta's, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden, in overleg met de leden, met de betalingsbalans- en de reservepositie van de leden en met ontwikkelingen op de valutamarkten, alsmede met de wenselijkheid van het bevorderen van, op langere termijn gezien, evenwichtige posities in het Fonds, met dien verstande dat, indien een lid verklaart dat het voorstelt de valuta van een ander lid te kopen omdat het kopende lid een equivalent bedrag in zijn eigen valuta wenst te verkrijgen, dat wordt aangeboden door het andere lid, dit eerste lid het recht zal hebben de valuta van het andere lid te kopen, tenzij het Fonds ingevolge artikel VII, sectie 3, kennisgeving heeft gedaan dat zijn bezit aan die valuta schaars is geworden.  

(e) 

(i) Ieder lid verzekert dat de saldi van zijn van het Fonds gekochte valuta saldi zijn van een vrij te gebruiken valuta of op het tijdstip van aankoop kunnen worden ingewisseld voor een vrij te gebruiken valuta van zijn keuze, zulks tegen een wisselkoers tussen de beide valuta's die gelijk is aan de onderlinge wisselkoers op basis van artikel XIX, sectie 7 (a).  

(ii) Ieder lid welks valuta wordt gekocht van het Fonds of wordt verkregen in ruil voor van het Fonds gekochte valuta, werkt samen met het Fonds en andere leden om het mogelijk te maken dat zodanige saldi van zijn valuta op het tijdstip van aankoop worden ingewisseld tegen de vrij te gebruiken valuta's van andere leden.  

(iii) Het inwisselen krachtens letter (e), (i) van deze sectie van een valuta die niet vrij te gebruiken is, dient te worden verricht door het lid welks valuta wordt gekocht, tenzij dat lid en het kopende lid een andere procedure overeenkomen.  

(iv) Een lid dat van het Fonds de vrij te gebruiken valuta van een ander lid koopt en deze op het tijdstip van aankoop wenst in te wisselen voor een andere vrij te gebruiken valuta, dient zulks met het andere lid te doen op verzoek van dat lid. Dit inwisselen geschiedt voor een door het andere lid gekozen vrij te gebruiken valuta tegen de in (i) hierboven vermelde wisselkoers.    

(f) Ingevolge het beleid en de procedures zoals vastgesteld door het Fonds, kan het er mee instemmen aan een participant die een aankoop doet in overeenstemming met deze sectie, bijzondere trekkingsrechten te verschaffen in plaats van de valuta's van andere leden.   Sectie 4. *Ontheffing van voorwaarden* Het Fonds kan naar goeddunken en op voorwaarden die zijn belangen waarborgen, van ieder der onder sectie 3 (b) (iii) en (iv) van dit artikel genoemde voorwaarden ontheffing verlenen, speciaal waar het leden geldt waarvan is gebleken dat zij een omvangrijk en geregeld gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds vermijden. Bij het verlenen van ontheffing houdt het rekening met periodieke of bijzondere behoeften van het lid dat om ontheffing verzoekt. Het Fonds houdt ook rekening met de bereidwilligheid van een lid aanvaardbare activa, die naar de mening van het Fonds voldoende waarde bezitten om zijn belangen te beveiligen, in onderpand te geven. Het Fonds kan als voorwaarde voor ontheffing het stellen van dergelijke zakelijke onderpanden eisen. Sectie 5. *Onbevoegdheid tot gebruikmaking van de algemene middelen van het Fonds* Telkens wanneer het Fonds van mening is dat een lid de algemene middelen van het Fonds aanwendt op een wijze, die in strijd is met de doelstellingen van het Fonds, doet het het lid een rapport toekomen, waarin de inzichten van het Fonds en een gepaste tijd voor beantwoording worden vermeld. Na het indienen van een dergelijk rapport bij een lid, kan het Fonds het gebruik van zijn algemene middelen door dat lid beperken. Indien geen antwoord van het lid op het rapport wordt ontvangen binnen de voorgeschreven termijn, of het ontvangen antwoord onbevredigend is, kan het Fonds voortgaan met het beperken van het gebruik van zijn algemene middelen door het lid en kan het, na redelijke termijnstelling, het lid onbevoegd verklaren tot gebruikmaking van de algemene middelen van het Fonds. Sectie 6. *Andere aankopen en verkopen van bijzondere trekkingsrechten door het Fonds* 

(a) Het Fonds kan door een deelnemer aangeboden bijzondere trekkingsrechten aanvaarden in ruil voor een equivalent bedrag aan de valuta's van andere leden.  

(b) Het Fonds kan aan een deelnemer, op diens verzoek, bijzondere trekkingsrechten verschaffen voor een equivalent bedrag aan de valuta's van andere leden. Het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid mag niet als gevolg van deze transacties worden vermeerderd tot boven het niveau waarop ingevolge sectie 8 (b) (ii) van dit artikel over het bezit provisies zouden worden geheven.  

(c) De krachtens deze sectie door het Fonds verschafte of aanvaarde valuta's worden gekozen in overeenstemming met het beleid waarin rekening wordt gehouden met de beginselen vervat in sectie 3 (d) of 7 (i) van dit artikel. Het Fonds kan ingevolge deze sectie uitsluitend transacties aangaan, indien een lid welks valuta door het Fonds wordt verschaft of aanvaard, instemt met dat gebruik van zijn valuta.   Sectie 7. *Wederinkoop door een lid van zijn valuta, door het Fonds gehouden* 

(a) Een lid heeft het recht te allen tijde het bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta terug te kopen waarover ingevolge sectie 8 (b) van dit artikel provisies worden geheven.  

(b) Van een lid dat ingevolge sectie 3 van dit artikel een aankoop heeft gedaan, zal normaliter worden verwacht dat het, naarmate zijn betalingsbalans- en reservepositie verbetert, het bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta dat resulteert uit de aankoop en waarover ingevolge sectie 8 (b) van dit artikel provisies worden geheven, terugkoopt. Een lid koopt dit bezit terug indien, in overeenstemming met het wederinkoopbeleid dat het Fonds vaststelt en na overleg met het lid, het Fonds aan het lid mededeelt dat het dient terug te kopen wegens een verbetering in zijn betalingsbalans- en reservepositie.  

(c) Een lid dat een aankoop heeft gedaan krachtens sectie 3 van dit artikel, koopt uiterlijk vijf jaar na de datum waarop de aankoop werd gedaan, het bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta, dat resulteert uit de aankoop en waarover ingevolge sectie 8 (b) van dit artikel provisies worden geheven, terug. Het Fonds kan voorschrijven dat wederinkoop door een lid dient te worden gedaan in termijnen gedurende een tijdvak te beginnen drie jaar en eindigende vijf jaar na de datum van een aankoop. Het Fonds kan, met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, de tijdvakken wijzigen voor wederinkoop ingevolge het bepaalde in deze letter en elk aldus vastgesteld tijdvak geldt voor alle leden.  

(d) Het Fonds kan, met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, andere tijdvakken vaststellen dan die welke van toepassing zijn overeenkomstig het bepaalde in letter (c) van deze sectie, die dezelfde dienen te zijn voor alle leden, voor de wederinkoop van valutabezit dat door het Fonds is verkregen ingevolge een speciaal beleid ter zake van het gebruik van zijn algemene middelen.  

(e) Een lid dient, in overeenstemming met het beleid dat het Fonds vaststelt met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, het bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta terug te kopen, dat niet is verkregen als gevolg van aankopen en waarover ingevolge sectie 8 (b) (ii) van dit artikel provisies worden geheven.  

(f) Een besluit waarbij wordt voorgeschreven dat krachtens een beleid ter zake van het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds, het tijdvak voor wederinkoop krachtens het bepaalde in letter (c) of (d) van deze sectie korter is dan dat wat geldt krachtens het beleid, is uitsluitend van toepassing op bezit dat is verkregen door het Fonds na de datum waarop het besluit van kracht is geworden.  

(g) Het Fonds kan op verzoek van een lid de datum van nakoming van een verplichting tot wederinkoop uitstellen, maar niet langer dan het maximum tijdvak vermeld in letter (c) of (d) hierboven of zoals vastgesteld krachtens het door het Fonds ingevolge letter (e) hierboven vastgestelde beleid, tenzij het Fonds met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, bepaalt dat een langer tijdvak voor wederinkoop, dat verenigbaar is met het tijdelijke gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds, is gerechtvaardigd, omdat nakoming van de verplichting op de gestelde datum zou resulteren in uitzonderlijke moeilijkheden voor het lid.  

(h) De beleidslijnen van het Fonds ingevolge sectie 3 (d) van dit artikel kunnen worden aangevuld met beleidslijnen krachtens welke het Fonds, na overleg met een lid, kan besluiten zijn bezit aan de valuta van het lid dat niet is teruggekocht in overeenstemming met deze sectie 7, ingevolge sectie 3 (b) van dit artikel te verkopen, onverminderd enigerlei maatregel die het Fonds zou zijn gemachtigd te nemen krachtens enige andere bepaling van deze Overeenkomst.  

(i) Elke wederinkoop ingevolge deze sectie dient te worden verricht bijzondere trekkingsrechten of met de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden. Het Fonds stelt beleidslijnen en procedures vast ter zake van de door leden bij wederinkoop te gebruiken valuta's, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de in sectie 3 (d) van dit artikel vervatte beginselen. Het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid dat wordt gebruikt bij wederinkoop, mag door de wederinkoop niet hoger worden dan het niveau waarboven ingevolge sectie (8 (b) (ii) van dit artikel provisies zouden worden geheven.  

(j) 

(i) Indien de door het Fonds in letter (i) hierboven gespecificeerde valuta van een lid geen vrij te gebruiken valuta is, dient het lid te waarborgen dat het terugkopende lid deze op het tijdstip van de wederinkoop kan verkrijgen in ruil voor een vrij te gebruiken valuta, naar keuze van het lid welks valuta is gespecificeerd. Een valutaruil ingevolge deze bepaling dient plaats te vinden tegen een wisselkoers tussen de beide valuta's die gelijk is aan de wisselkoers tussen deze beide op basis van artikel XIX, sectie 7 (a).  

(ii) Ieder lid welks valuta door het Fonds wordt gespecificeerd voor wederinkoop, dient met het Fonds en andere leden samen te werken om de terugkopende leden, op het tijdstip van de wederinkoop, in staat te stellen de gespecificeerde valuta te verkrijgen in ruil voor de vrij te gebruiken valuta's van andere leden.  

(iii) Een ruil ingevolge letter (j) (i) hierboven vindt plaats met het lid welks valuta wordt gespecificeerd, tenzij dat lid en het terugkopende lid een andere procedure overeenkomen.  

(iv) Indien een terugkopend lid, op het tijdstip van de wederinkoop, de vrij te gebruiken valuta van een ander lid, zoals gespecificeerd door het Fonds onder (i) hierboven, wenst te verkrijgen, verkrijgt het, op verzoek van het andere lid, diens valuta in ruil voor een vrij te gebruiken valuta, tegen de in letter (j) (i) hierboven bedoelde wisselkoers. Het Fonds kan regelingen vaststellen ter zake van de vrij te gebruiken valuta die dient te worden verschaft bij een ruiling.     Sectie 8. *Provisies* 

(a) 

(i) Het Fonds berekent een administratieprovisie over de aankoop door een lid van bijzondere trekkingsrechten of van de valuta van een ander lid in de Algemene Middelenrekening in ruil voor zijn eigen valuta, met dien verstande dat het Fonds een lagere administratieprovisie kan berekenen over aankopen in de reservetranche dan over andere aankopen. De administratieprovisie over aankopen in de reservetranche mag niet meer bedragen dan een half procent.  

(ii) Het Fonds kan een provisie berekenen voor bijstandsarrangementen of soortgelijke arrangementen. Het Fonds kan besluiten dat de provisie voor een regeling wegvalt tegen de krachtens (i) hierboven over aankopen ingevolge dit arrangement berekende administratieprovisie.    

(b) Het Fonds berekent provisie over zijn gemiddelde dagelijkse saldo aan de valuta van een lid in de Algemene Middelenrekening, voor zover dit 

(i) is verkregen ingevolge een beleid waarvoor krachtens artikel XXX (c) een uitsluiting geldt,  

(ii) meer beloopt dan het bedrag van het quotum van het lid na uitsluiting van een eventueel saldo zoals bedoeld in (i) hierboven.   De hoogte van de provisie stijgt normaliter met tussenpozen gedurende het tijdvak waarin het saldo wordt gehouden.  

(c) Indien een lid nalaat een krachtens sectie 7 van dit artikel vereiste wederinkoop te doen, kan het Fonds, na overleg met het lid over de vermindering van het bezit van het Fonds aan diens valuta, die provisies opleggen die het Fonds passend acht over zijn bezit aan de valuta van het lid die had moeten worden wederingekocht.  

(d) Voor het bepalen van de hoogte van een provisie ingevolge letters (a) en (b) hierboven, die gelijk is voor alle leden, en ingevolge letter (c) hierboven, is een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal vereist.  

(e) Een lid betaalt alle provisies in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, met dien verstande dat in uitzonderlijke omstandigheden het Fonds een lid kan toestaan provisies te betalen in de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden, na overleg met deze leden of in zijn eigen valuta. Het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid dient niet te worden vermeerderd als gevolg van betalingen door andere leden krachtens deze bepaling tot boven het niveau waarboven ingevolge letter (b) (ii) van deze sectie provisies zouden worden geheven.   Sectie 9. *Remuneratie* 

(a) Het Fonds betaalt remuneratie over het bedrag waarmede het percentage van het quotum voorgeschreven onder letter (b) of (c) hieronder, het gemiddelde dagelijkse saldo van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid in de Algemene Middelenrekening overschrijdt, anders dan het saldo dat is verkregen krachtens een beleid waarvoor krachtens artikel XXX letter (c) een uitsluiting geldt. De hoogte van de remuneratie, die wordt bepaald door het Fonds met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, is hetzelfde voor alle leden en bedraagt niet meer of minder dan vier vijfde van de rentevoet genoemd in artikel XX, sectie 3. Bij het vaststellen van het remuneratietarief houdt het Fonds rekening met de hoogte van de provisies ingevolge artikel V, sectie 8 (b)  

(b) Het quotumpercentage dat van toepassing is ten behoeve van letter (a) hierboven is: 

(i) voor ieder lid dat lid is geworden vóór de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, een quotumpercentage dat overeenkomt met vijfenzeventig procent van zijn quotum op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, en voor ieder lid dat lid is geworden na de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, een quotumpercentage dat is berekend door het totaal van de bedragen die overeenkomen met de quotumpercentages die op de datum waarop het lid lid is geworden, gelden voor de andere leden, te delen door het totaal van de quota van de andere leden op dezelfde datum; plus  

(ii) de bedragen die het heeft betaald aan het Fonds in valuta of in bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge artikel III, sectie 3 (a), sedert de datum die geldt ingevolge letter (b) (i) hierboven; en minus  

(iii) de bedragen die het heeft ontvangen uit het Fonds in valuta of in bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge artikel III, sectie 3 (c) sedert de datum die geldt ingevolge letter (b) (i) hierboven.    

(c) Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal het laatste quotumpercentage dat ten behoeve van letter (a) hierboven voor ieder lid geldt, verhogen tot: 

(i) een percentage dat niet meer beloopt dan honderd procent en dat wordt vastgesteld voor ieder lid op basis van dezelfde criteria voor alle leden, of  

(ii) honderd procent voor alle leden.    

(d) De remuneratie wordt betaald in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, met dien verstande dat hetzij het Fonds, hetzij het lid kan besluiten dat de betaling aan het lid dient te worden verricht in zijn eigen valuta.   Sectie 10. *Berekeningen* 

(a) De waarde van de activa en passiva van het Fonds in de rekeningen van de Algemene Afdeling worden uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten.  

(b) Alle berekeningen verband houdende met valuta's van leden ten behoeve van de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, met uitzondering van artikel IV en schema C, worden gemaakt tegen de koersen die het Fonds voor deze valuta's berekent, in overeenstemming met sectie 11 van dit artikel.  

(c) Bij de berekeningen voor het vaststellen van de valutabedragen in relatie tot het quotum ten behoeve van de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, wordt de valuta in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening of in de Investeringsrekening buiten beschouwing gelaten.   Sectie 11. *Handhaving van de waarde* 

(a) De waarde van de valuta's van leden in de Algemene Middelenrekening dient te worden gehandhaafd in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, overeenkomstig de wisselkoersen bedoeld in artikel XIX, sectie 7 (a).  

(b) Een aanpassing in het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van het lid ingevolge deze sectie dient plaats te vinden bij gebruik van die valuta in een verrichting of transactie tussen het Fonds en een ander lid en op de andere tijdstippen waartoe het Fonds eventueel beslist of waarom het lid verzoekt. Betalingen aan of door het Fonds in verband met een aanpassing dienen te worden verricht binnen een redelijke termijn, zoals bepaald door het Fonds, na de datum van aanpassing en op elk eventueel ander tijdstip waarop zulks wordt verzocht door het lid.   Sectie 12. *Andere verrichtingen en transacties* 

(a) Het Fonds wordt bij zijn gehele beleid en bij al zijn beslissingen ingevolge deze sectie geleid door de doelstellingen vervat in artikel VIII, sectie 7 en door het streven te vermijden dat op de goudmarkt de prijs wordt gereguleerd, of een vaste prijs tot stand wordt gebracht.  

(b) Besluiten van het Fonds om over te gaan tot verrichtingen of transacties ingevolge letters (c), (d), en (e) hieronder, worden genomen met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal.  

(c) Het Fonds kan goud verkopen voor de valuta van ongeacht welk lid, na overleg met het lid voor welks valuta het goud wordt verkocht, met dien verstande dat het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een lid in de Algemene Middelenrekening, door de verkoop niet, zonder de in stemming van het lid, mag worden vermeerderd tot boven het niveau waarboven ingevolge sectie 8 (b) (ii) van dit artikel provisies zouden worden geheven, en met dien verstande ook dat, op verzoek van het lid, het Fonds op het tijdstip van de verkoop dat deel van de ontvangen valuta dat tot een zodanige vermeerdering zou leiden, dient in te wisselen voor de valuta van een ander lid. Het inwisselen van een valuta voor de valuta van een ander lid vindt plaats na overleg met dat lid, en hierdoor mag het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van dat lid niet worden vermeerderd tot boven het niveau waarboven ingevolge sectie 8 (b) (ii) van dit artikel provisies zouden worden geheven. Het Fonds stelt beleidslijnen en procedures vast ter zake van het inwisselen, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de ingevolge sectie 7 (i) van dit artikel toegepaste beginselen. Verkopen aan een lid ingevolge deze bepaling dienen plaats te vinden tegen een voor iedere transactie op basis van de marktprijzen overeengekomen prijs.  

(d) Het Fonds kan van een lid betalingen in goud aanvaarden in plaats van in bijzondere trekkingsrechten of valuta ten behoeve van enigerlei verrichtingen of transacties ingevolge deze Overeenkomst. Betalingen aan het Fonds ingevolge deze bepalingen dienen plaats te vinden tegen een voor iedere verrichting of transactie op basis van de marktprijzen overeengekomen prijs.  

(e) Het Fonds kan goud verkopen dat het in bezit heeft op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, aan die leden die lid waren op 31 augustus 1975 en die ermee instemmen dit te kopen, naar rato van hun quota op die datum. Indien het Fonds voornemens is goud te verkopen ingevolge letter (c) hierboven ten behoeve van letter (f) (ii) hieronder, kan het aan ieder ontwikkelingsland dat lid is en dat ermee instemt dit te kopen, dat deel van het goud verkopen dat, indien het werd verkocht ingevolge letter (c) hierboven, het overschot teweeg zou hebben gebracht dat ingevolge letter (f) (iii) hieronder aan hem had kunnen worden gedistribueerd. Het goud dat ingevolge deze bepaling zou worden verkocht aan een lid ten aanzien waarvan is verklaard dat het ingevolge sectie 5 van dit artikel onbevoegd is tot het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds, wordt aan dit lid verkocht wanneer de onbevoegdheid is opgeheven, tenzij het Fonds besluit eerder tot de verkoop over te gaan. De verkoop van goud aan een lid ingevolge het bepaalde in deze letter (e) vindt plaats in ruil voor zijn valuta en tegen een prijs die op het tijdstip van de verkoop gelijk is aan een bijzonder trekkingsrecht per 0,888.671 gram fijn goud.  

(f) Wanneer het Fonds ingevolge letter (c) hierboven goud verkoopt dat het in bezit heeft op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, wordt een bedrag van de opbrengst, dat op het tijdstip van de verkoop gelijk is aan een bijzonder trekkingsrecht per 0,888.671 gram fijn goud, geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening en, tenzij het Fonds anders mocht beslissen ingevolge letter (g) hieronder, wordt elk overschot geboekt op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening. De activa in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening dienen gescheiden te worden gehouden van de andere rekeningen van de Algemene Afdeling en kunnen te allen tijde worden gebruikt: 

(i) om overmakingen te verrichten op de Algemene Middelenrekening voor onmiddellijk gebruik bij verrichtingen en transacties die zijn toegestaan door de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst anders dan deze sectie;  

(ii) voor verrichtingen en transacties die niet worden toegestaan door andere bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, maar die verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds. Krachtens het bepaalde in deze letter (f) (ii) kan op bijzondere voorwaarden betalingsbalanshulp beschikbaar worden gesteld aan ontwikkelingslanden in moeilijke omstandigheden die lid zijn, en tot dit doel houdt het Fonds rekening met het niveau van het inkomen per hoofd van de bevolking;  

(iii) voor de distributie aan die ontwikkelingslanden die op 31 augustus 1975 lid waren, naar rato van hun quota op die datum, van het deel van de activa die het Fonds besluit te gebruiken ten behoeve van (ii) hierboven dat overeenkomt met het aandeel van de quota van deze leden op de datum van distributie in het totaal van de quota van alle leden op dezelfde datum, met dien verstande dat de distributie ingevolge deze bepaling aan een lid ten aanzien waarvan is verklaard dat het ingevolge sectie 5 van dit artikel onbevoegd is tot het gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds, plaats vindt wanneer het wel bevoegd is, tenzij het Fonds besluit de distributie eerder te verrichten.   Besluiten om activa te gebruiken ingevolge (i) hierboven, worden genomen met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal en besluiten ingevolge (ii) en (iii) hierboven worden genomen met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal.  

(g) Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal besluiten een gedeelte van het in letter (f) hierboven bedoelde overschot over te maken op de Investeringsrekening voor gebruik ingevolge het bepaalde in artikel XII, sectie 6 (f).  

(h) In afwachting van gebruik zoals aangegeven in letter (f) hierboven, kan het Fonds de valuta van een lid in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening naar eigen inzicht gebruiken voor beleggingen, in overeenstemming met de door het Fonds, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale aantal stemmen, aangenomen voorschriften en regelingen. Het inkomen uit belegging en rente dat wordt ontvangen ingevolge letter (f) (ii) hierboven wordt geboekt op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening.  

(i) De Algemene Middelenrekening wordt van tijd tot tijd aangezuiverd ten behoeve van de administratiekosten van de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening, die worden betaald uit de Algemene Middelenrekening, en wel door overmakingen uit de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening op basis van een redelijke raming van zodanige kosten.  

(j) De Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening wordt afgesloten in geval van liquidatie van het Fonds en kan vóór de liquidatie van het Fonds worden afgesloten bij besluit met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal. Na afsluiting van de rekening wegens liquidatie van het Fonds, worden alle eventuele activa op deze rekening uitgekeerd in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in schema K. Na afsluiting vóór de liquidatie van het Fonds, dienen alle eventuele activa op deze rekening te worden overgemaakt naar de Algemene Middelenrekening voor onmiddellijk gebruik bij verrichtingen en transacties. Het Fonds stelt met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal regels en voorschriften vast voor het beheer van de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening.  

(k) Indien het Fonds uit hoofde van letter (c) hierboven goud verkoopt dat het heeft verworven na de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, wordt een bedrag van de opbrengst ter hoogte van de aankoopprijs van het goud overgemaakt op de Algemene Middelenrekening en wordt het eventuele restant overgemaakt op de Investeringsrekening, voor aanwending overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel XII, sectie 6, (f). Indien goud dat het Fonds na de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst heeft verworven wordt verkocht na 7 april 2008 maar vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze bepaling maakt het Fonds bij de inwerkingtreding van deze bepaling en onverminderd de limiet vermeld in artikel XII, sectie 6, (f) (ii) een bedrag van de Algemene Middelenrekening over op de Investeringsrekening ter hoogte van de opbrengst van deze verkoop, na aftrek van (i) de aankoopprijs van het verkochte goud, en (ii) het bedrag boven de aankoopprijs die eventueel vóór de datum van inwerkingtreding van deze bepaling kan zijn overgemaakt op de Investeringsrekening.    

### Artikel  VI  

####Overmaking van kapitaal

Sectie 1. *Gebruikmaking van de algemene middelen van het Fonds voor overmaking van kapitaal* 

(a) Een lid kan geen gebruik maken van de algemene middelen van het Fonds om een omvangrijke of voortdurende afvloeiing van kapitaal te financieren, behalve zoals bepaald in sectie 2 van dit artikel, en het Fonds kan een lid verzoeken controle uit te oefenen om een dergelijk gebruik van de algemene middelen van het Fonds te voorkomen. Indien het lid, na een dergelijk verzoek ontvangen te hebben, in gebreke blijft passende controles uit te oefenen, kan het Fonds het lid onbevoegd verklaren van de algemene middelen van het Fonds gebruik te maken.  

(b) Niets in deze sectie wordt geacht: 

(i) het gebruik maken van de algemene middelen van het Fonds te verhinderen voor kapitaaltransacties tot een redelijk bedrag, die nodig zijn voor de uitbreiding van exporten of de normale afwikkeling van handels- en bankzaken, dan wel andere zakelijke aangelegenheden; of  

(ii) kapitaalbewegingen, die uit eigen middelen van een lid worden gefinancierd, te beïnvloeden. De leden verbinden zich echter ertoe dat deze kapitaalbewegingen in overeenstemming met de doelstellingen van het Fonds zullen zijn.     Sectie 2. *Bijzondere bepalingen inzake overmaking van kapitaal* Een lid heeft het recht aankopen in de reservetranche te doen in verband met overmaking van kapitaal. Sectie 3. *Controle op overmaking van kapitaal* Leden kunnen de controle uitoefenen die noodzakelijk is om internationale kapitaalbewegingen te reguleren, maar geen lid kan die controle op zulk een wijze uitoefenen dat de betalingen voor lopende transacties worden beperkt of dat overmakingen van bedragen voor de vereffening van verplichtingen bovenmatig worden vertraagd, behalve voor zover bepaald in artikel VII, sectie 3 (b) en artikel XIV, sectie 2.  

### Artikel  VII  

####Aanvulling en schaarse valuta's

Sectie 1. *Maatregelen ter aanvulling van het bezit van het Fonds aan valuta's* Het Fonds kan, wanneer het een zodanig optreden raadzaam acht om zijn bezit aan de valuta van enig lid in de Algemene Middelenrekening, nodig in verband met zijn transacties, aan te vullen, een of beide van de volgende maatregelen nemen: 

(i) aan het lid voorstellen dat het, op voorwaarden en bedingen die tussen het Fonds en het lid worden overeengekomen, zijn valuta aan het Fonds leent of dat het Fonds, met de instemming van het lid, deze valuta leent van een andere bron, hetzij binnen, hetzij ten het grondgebied van het lid. Geen lid is echter op enigerlei wijze verplicht zodanige leningen aan het Fonds te verstrekken of ermee in te stemmen dat het Fonds zijn valuta van enige andere bron leent;  

(ii) het lid verzoeken, indien dit participant is, zijn valuta aan het Fonds te verkopen tegen bijzondere trekkingsrechten geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening, zulks onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in artikel XIX, sectie 4. Bij het aanvullen van zijn bezit met bijzondere trekkingsrechten, neemt het Fonds naar behoren de beginselen van aanwijzing in acht, vervat in artikel XIX, sectie 5.   Sectie 2. *Algemene schaarste aan een valuta* Wanneer het Fonds constateert dat er zich een algemene schaarste aan een bepaalde valuta ontwikkelt, kan het Fonds de leden daarvan in kennis stellen en een rapport uitbrengen, waarin de oorzaken van de schaarste worden uiteengezet en aanbevelingen voor het opheffen van de schaarste worden gegeven. Een vertegenwoordiger van het lid welks valuta hierbij is betrokken, neemt aan de voorbereiding van het rapport deel. Sectie 3. *Schaarste van het eigen bezit van het Fonds aan bepaalde valuta's* 

(a) Wanneer aan het Fonds duidelijk wordt dat de vraag naar de valuta van een lid de capaciteit van het Fonds om deze valuta ter beschikking te stellen, ernstig bedreigt, verklaart het Fonds, ongeacht of het ingevolge sectie 2 van dit artikel een rapport heeft uitgebracht of niet, deze valuta officieel schaars en in het vervolg wijst het de aanwezige en de te ontvangen bedragen van deze schaarse valuta toe met redelijke inachtneming van de relatieve behoeften der leden, de algemene internationale economische toestand en alle andere ter zake dienende overwegingen. Het Fonds brengt tevens verslag uit betreffende zijn optreden.  

(b) Een officiële verklaring als hierboven onder letter (a) bedoeld, geldt voor ieder lid als machtiging om, na overleg met het Fonds, tijdelijk de vrijheid van deviezentransacties in de schaarse valuta te beperken. Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel IV en schema C, heeft het lid volledige rechtsbevoegdheid om de aard van zodanige beperkingen te bepalen, maar zij dienen niet meer belemmerend te zijn dan nodig is om de vraag naar de schaarse valuta te beperken tot de voorraad die in het bezit van het desbetreffende lid is of hem zal toevloeien. Zij worden zo snel als de omstandigheden het toelaten, verzacht en opgeheven.  

(c) De onder letter (b) hierboven bedoelde machtiging vervalt steeds zodra het Fonds officieel verklaart dat de desbetreffende valuta niet meer schaars is.   Sectie 4. *Toepassing der deviezenbeperkingen* Ieder lid dat ten aanzien van de valuta van een ander lid overeenkomstig het bepaalde in sectie 3 (b) van dit artikel beperkingen invoert, neemt alle bezwaren van het andere lid ten aanzien van de toepassing van zodanige beperkingen in welwillende overweging. Sectie 5. *Invloed van andere internationale overeenkomsten op deviezenbeperkingen* De leden komen overeen dat zij zich op de verplichtingen die voortspruiten uit enige vóór het sluiten van deze Overeenkomst gemaakte afspraak, niet op zodanige wijze zullen beroepen, dat het bepaalde in dit artikel daardoor geen werkingskracht kan hebben.  

### Artikel  VIII  

####Algemene verplichtingen der leden

Sectie 1. *Inleiding* Ieder lid neemt, naast de verplichtingen die ingevolge andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst worden aanvaard, de verplichtingen aangegeven in dit artikel op zich. Sectie 2. *Vermijden van beperkingen op lopende betalingen* 

(a) Behoudens het bepaalde in artikel VII, sectie 3 (b) en artikel XIV, sectie 2, legt geen lid, zonder de toestemming van het Fonds, beperkingen op ten aanzien van betalingen en overmakingen voor lopende internationale transacties.  

(b) Valutacontracten, waarbij de valuta van enig lid is betrokken en die in strijd zijn met de deviezenwetgeving van dat lid, welke deviezenwetgeving in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst is gehandhaafd of ingevoerd, hebben geen rechtskracht binnen het grondgebied van enig lid. Bovendien kunnen leden, met wederzijdse overeenstemming, samenwerken tot het treffen van maatregelen met het doel de deviezenwetgeving van ieder van de leden doeltreffender te maken, mits zodanige maatregelen en wetsbepalingen in overeenstemming zijn met deze Overeenkomst.   Sectie 3. *Vermijden van discriminerende wisselkoerspraktijken* Geen lid laat zich in met, of stemt erin toe dat een van zijn met de schatkist in verband staande instanties genoemd in artikel V, sectie 1, zich inlaat met discriminerende wisselkoersafspraken of meervoudige wisselkoerspraktijken, hetzij binnen hetzij buiten de marges zoals gesteld in artikel IV, dan wel voorgeschreven bij of ingevolge schema C, tenzij met een machtiging ingevolge deze Overeenkomst of met goedkeuring van het Fonds. Wanneer zodanige afspraken en praktijken lopende zijn op de datum waarop deze Overeenkomst in werking treedt, pleegt het desbetreffende lid met het Fonds overleg omtrent hun geleidelijke opheffing, tenzij zij worden gehandhaafd of opgelegd ingevolge artikel XIV, sectie 2, in welk geval het bepaalde in sectie 3 van dat artikel van toepassing is. Sectie 4. *Inwisselbaarheid van saldi in het buitenland* 

(a) Ieder lid koopt saldi, luidende in zijn eigen valuta en gehouden door een ander lid, indien dit laatste lid bij het verzoek tot aankoop aantoont: 

(i) dat de te kopen saldi kort geleden zijn verkregen als gevolg van lopende transacties; of  

(ii) dat hun inwisseling noodzakelijk is voor het verrichten van betalingen voor lopende transacties.   Het kopende lid heeft de keus, hetzij in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, zulks onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in artikel XIX, sectie 4, hetzij in de valuta van het verzoekende lid te betalen.  

(b) De verplichting vermeld in letter (a) hierboven bestaat niet: 

(i) wanneer de inwisselbaarheid van de saldi ingevolge sectie 2 van dit artikel of artikel VI, sectie 3 beperkt is;  

(ii) wanneer de saldi zijn ontstaan als gevolg van transacties, die hebben plaats gevonden vóór het opheffen door een lid van beperkingen, die ingevolge artikel XIV, sectie 2 worden gehandhaafd of ingevoerd;  

(iii) wanneer de saldi zijn verkregen in strijd met de deviezenvoorschriften van het lid, waaraan wordt verzocht de saldi te kopen;  

(iv) wanneer de valuta van het lid dat om de aankoop verzoekt, ingevolge artikel VII, sectie 3 (a) schaars is verklaard;  

(v) wanneer het lid waaraan verzocht wordt de saldi te kopen, om enige reden niet het recht heeft valuta's van andere leden van het Fonds tegen zijn eigen valuta te kopen.     Sectie 5. *Verstrekken van inlichtingen* 

(a) Het Fonds kan de leden verzoeken het die inlichtingen te verstrekken die het noodzakelijk acht voor zijn werkzaamheden, daaronder begrepen, als minimum nodig voor een doeltreffend vervullen van de plichten van het Fonds, nationale gegevens betreffende de volgende onderwerpen: 

(i) het officiële bezit in binnen- en buitenland aan (1) goud, (2) vreemde valuta;  

(ii) het bezit in binnen- en buitenland van banken en financiële instellingen, die geen officiële instanties zijn, aan (1) goud, (2) vreemde valuta;  

(iii) de goudproduktie;  

(iv) de uitvoer en invoer van goud, gesplitst naar landen van bestemming en oorsprong;  

(v) de waarde van de totale uitvoer en invoer van goederen, uitgedrukt in eigen valuta, gesplitst naar landen van bestemming en oorsprong;  

(vi) de internationale betalingsbalans, bestaande uit (1) het goederen- en dienstenverkeer, (2) goudtransacties, (3) bekende kapitaaltransacties en (4) overige posten;  

(vii) de positie van de internationale investeringen, dat wil zeggen de buitenlandse investeringen binnen het grondgebied van het lid en de investeringen in het buitenland die het eigendom zijn van ingezetenen van het lid, voor zover het mogelijk is deze inlichtingen te verstrekken;  

(viii) het nationale inkomen;  

(ix) de prijs-indices, d.w.z. indices van goederenprijzen bij de groot- en kleinhandel en van prijzen van export- en importgoederen;  

(x) de bied- en laatkoersen van vreemde valuta's;  

(xi) de deviezenvoorschriften, d.w.z. een uitgebreid overzicht van de deviezenvoorschriften die ten tijde van toetreding als lid van het Fonds van kracht zijn, en bijzonderheden betreffende latere wijzigingen al naar gelang die plaatsvinden; en  

(xii) waar officiële clearing-overeenkomsten bestaan: bijzonderheden betreffende de bedragen uit handelstransacties en financiële transacties, die in de clearing op verrekening wachten en bijzonderheden betreffende de wachttermijn daarvan.    

(b) Bij het verzoeken om inlichtingen houdt het Fonds rekening met het onderling verschillende vermogen van de leden om de gewenste gegevens te verstrekken. De leden zijn niet verplicht de inlichtingen zodanig gedetailleerd te verstrekken, dat de aangelegenheden van afzonderlijke personen of vennootschappen openbaar worden gemaakt. De leden verplichten zich echter de gewenste inlichtingen zo gedetailleerd en nauwkeurig mogelijk te verstrekken en, voor zover mogelijk, het uitsluitend schatten te vermijden.  

(c) Het Fonds kan een regeling treffen, waarbij het met toestemming van de leden verdere inlichtingen verkrijgt. Het doet dienst als centrum voor het verzamelen en uitwisselen van gegevens betreffende monetaire en financiële problemen, waardoor het maken van studies die ten doel hebben de leden bij te staan in de ontwikkeling van een beleid dat de doelstellingen van het Fonds dient, wordt vergemakkelijkt.   Sectie 6. *Overleg tussen de leden betreffende bestaande internationale overeenkomsten* Waar een lid ingevolge deze Overeenkomst is gemachtigd in de bijzondere en tijdelijke omstandigheden, genoemd in deze Overeenkomst, deviezenbeperkingen te handhaven of in te voeren en leden vóór het sluiten van deze Overeenkomst andere onderlinge verbintenissen hebben aangegaan die in strijd zijn met de toepassing van zodanige deviezenbeperkingen, plegen de partijen die zodanige verbintenissen zijn aangegaan met elkaar overleg, ten einde de nodige wederzijds aanvaardbare aanpassingen aan te brengen. Het bepaalde in dit artikel laat de werking van artikel VII, sectie 5 onverlet. Sectie 7. *Verplichting tot samenwerking ten aanzien van het beleid inzake reservemiddelen* Ieder lid verbindt zich samen te werken met het Fonds en met andere leden, ten einde te verzekeren dat het beleid van het lid ter zake van reservemiddelen verenigbaar is met het streven een beter internationaal toezicht op de internationale liquiditeit te bevorderen en het bijzondere trekkingsrecht tot voornaamste reservemiddel in het internationale monetaire stelsel te maken.

Sectie 10. *Toepassing van het artikel* Ieder lid onderneemt binnen zijn grondgebied de nodige stappen met het doel de beginselen vervat in dit artikel, in zijn eigen nationale recht tot gelding te brengen en deelt het Fonds in bijzonderheden mede welke stappen het heeft ondernomen.

### Artikel  XII  

####Organisatie en beheer

Sectie 1. *Structuur van het Fonds* Het Fonds heeft een Raad van Bestuur, een College van Bewindvoerders, een Directeur en een staf, en een Raad, indien de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal besluit dat het bepaalde in schema D zal worden toegepast. Sectie 2. *Raad van Bestuur*

Iedere Bestuurder en iedere Plaatsvervanger vervult zijn ambt totdat een nieuwe benoeming plaatsvindt. Een Plaatsvervanger heeft geen stemrecht behalve bij afwezigheid van de Bestuurder wiens vervanger hij is. De Raad van Bestuur verkiest een van de Bestuurders als voorzitter.  

(b) De Raad van Bestuur kan het College van Bewindvoerders machtigen alle bevoegdheden van de Raad van Bestuur uit te oefenen, met uitzondering van die welke door deze Overeenkomst rechtstreeks worden toegekend aan de Raad van Bestuur.  

(c) De Raad van Bestuur houdt de vergaderingen die de Raad van Bestuur nodig acht of door het College van Bewindvoerders worden bijeengeroepen, wanneer dit door vijftien leden of door leden die een vierde van het totale stemmenaantal bezitten, wordt verzocht.

(f) De Raad van Bestuur kan door middel van een regeling een procedure vaststellen waarbij het College van Bewindvoerders, wanneer het dit in het belang van het Fonds acht, een beslissing van de Bestuurders betreffende een bepaald vraagstuk kan verkrijgen, zonder daarvoor een vergadering van de Raad van Bestuur bijeen te roepen.  

(g) De Raad van Bestuur en, voor zover daartoe gemachtigd, het College van Bewindvoerders, kunnen die voorschriften en regelingen vaststellen, die nodig of dienstig zijn voor de leiding der zaken van het Fonds.  

(h) Bestuurders en Plaatsvervangers nemen als zodanig hun functies waar zonder een vergoeding van het Fonds te ontvangen, maar het Fonds kan een redelijke vergoeding geven voor de kosten die zij hebben gemaakt om de vergaderingen bij te wonen.  

(i) De Raad van Bestuur stelt de aan de Bewindvoerders en hun Plaatsvervangers te betalen beloning en het salaris en de voorwaarden van het arbeidscontract van de Directeur vast.  

(j) De Raad van Bestuur en het College van Bewindvoerders kunnen die commissies benoemen die zij aanbevelenswaardig achten. Het lidmaatschap van de commissies behoeft niet te worden beperkt tot Bestuurders of Bewindvoerders of hun Plaatsvervangers.   Sectie 3. *College van Bewindvoerders* 

(a) Het College van Bewindvoerders is verantwoordelijk voor de leiding der zaken van het Fonds en tot dit doel oefenen zij alle bevoegdheden uit die hun door de Raad van Bestuur zijn overgedragen.  

(b) Het College van Bewindvoerders bestaat uit Bewindvoerders en wordt voorgezeten door de Directeur. Van de Bewindvoerders: 

(i) worden er vijf benoemd door de vijf leden met de grootste quota; en  

(ii) worden er vijftien gekozen door de andere leden.   Bij iedere regelmatige verkiezing van de Bewindvoerders kan de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal het in (ii) hierboven genoemde aantal Bewindvoerders vergroten of verkleinen. Het in (ii) hierboven genoemde aantal Bewindvoerders wordt met één of twee verminderd, naar gelang van de omstandigheden, indien er Bewindvoerders worden benoemd ingevolge (c) hieronder, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal besluit dat deze vermindering de doeltreffende vervulling van de functies van het College van Bewindvoerders of van de Bewindvoerders zou belemmeren, dan wel een wenselijk evenwicht in het College van Bewindvoerders zou dreigen te verstoren.  

(c) Indien, bij de tweede regelmatige verkiezing van de Bewindvoerders en bij daarop volgende verkiezingen, onder de leden die ingevolge letter (b) (i) hierboven gerechtigd zijn tot het benoemen van Bewindvoerders, niet begrepen zijn de twee leden, waarvan de bedragen aan hun door het Fonds in de Algemene Middelenrekening gehouden valuta's gemiddeld over de twee voorafgaande jaren, in absolute bedragen en uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, het verst beneden hun onderscheiden quota zijn gedaald, kunnen zodanige leden, elk of beide, al naar gelang, een Bewindvoerder benoemen.  

(d) Verkiezingen van te kiezen Bewindvoerders vinden plaats met tussenpozen van twee jaar, in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in schema E, aangevuld met de voorschriften die het Fonds passend acht. Bij iedere regelmatige verkiezing van Bewindvoerders kan de Raad van Bestuur voorschriften uitvaardigen die wijzigingen aanbrengen in het stemmenaandeel dat nodig is voor het kiezen van Bewindvoerders ingevolge het bepaalde in schema E.  

(e) Iedere Bewindvoerder benoemt een plaatsvervanger met volledige bevoegdheid voor hem op te treden wanneer hij niet aanwezig is, met dien verstande dat de Raad van Bestuur voorschriften kan aannemen die een Bewindvoerder die door meer dan een omschreven aantal leden is gekozen in staat stellen twee plaatsvervangers te benoemen. Indien dergelijke voorschriften worden aangenomen, mogen zij slechts worden aangepast in het kader van de regelmatige verkiezing van Bewindvoerders en zullen zij van een Bewindvoerder die twee plaatsvervangers benoemt verlangen: 

(i) dat hij een plaatsvervanger benoemt die optreedt voor de Bewindvoerder wanneer deze niet aanwezig is en beide plaatsvervangers aanwezig zijn; en  

(ii) dat hij de plaatsvervanger benoemt die bevoegdheden van de Bewindvoerder krachtens letter (f) hieronder uitoefent.   Indien de Bewindvoerders aanwezig zijn, mogen hun plaatsvervangers vergaderingen bijwonen, doch zonder stemrecht.  

(f) Bewindvoerders blijven in functie totdat hun opvolgers zijn benoemd of gekozen. Indien de plaats van een gekozen Bewindvoerder meer dan negentig dagen voor het einde van zijn ambtsperiode openvalt, wordt voor het resterende deel van de ambtsperiode een andere Bewindvoerder gekozen door de leden die de vorige Bewindvoerder hebben gekozen. Voor verkiezing is een meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen nodig. Zolang de functie onvervuld blijft, oefent de plaatsvervanger van de vorige Bewindvoerder zijn bevoegdheden uit, met uitzondering van het recht een plaatsvervanger te benoemen.  

(g) Het College van Bewindvoerders oefent permanent op het hoofdkantoor van het Fonds zijn functies uit en vergadert zo vaak als de werkzaamheden van het Fonds dit vereisen.  

(h) Het quorum voor een vergadering van het College van Bewindvoerders wordt gevormd door een meerderheid van Bewindvoerders die niet minder dan de helft van het totale stemmenaantal vertegenwoordigen.  

(i) 

(i) Iedere benoemde Bewindvoerder is gerechtigd het aantal stemt te brengen dat volgens sectie 5 van dit artikel aan het lid dat hem benoemt, is toegewezen.  

(ii) Indien de stemmen die zijn toegewezen aan het lid dat ingevolge letter (c) hierboven een Bewindvoerder benoemt, door een Bewindvoerder zijn uitgebracht tezamen met de stemmen die als gevolg van de laatste regelmatige verkiezing van Bewindvoerders zijn toegewezen aan andere leden, kan het lid met ieder van de andere leden overeenkomen dat het aantal hem toegewezen stemmen wordt uitgebracht door de benoemde Bewindvoerder. Een lid dat zulks overeenkomt, neemt niet deel aan de verkiezing van Bewindvoerders.  

(iii) Iedere gekozen Bewindvoerder is gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat bij zijn verkiezing op hem is uitgebracht.  

(iv) Wanneer het bepaalde in sectie 5 (b) van dit artikel van toepassing is, wordt het aantal stemmen dat een Bewindvoerder anders zou hebben mogen uitbrengen, dienovereenkomstig vermeerderd of verminderd. Alle stemmen, die een Bewindvoerder gerechtigd is uit te brengen, worden als een blok uitgebracht.  

(v) Wanneer de opschorting van het stemrecht van een lid wordt beëindigd ingevolge artikel XXVI, sectie 2, letter b, en het lid niet gerechtigd is een Bewindvoerder te benoemen, kan het lid met alle leden die een Bewindvoerder hebben gekozen, overeenkomen dat het aantal stemmen dat aan dat lid is toegewezen, wordt uitgebracht door die Bewindvoerder, met dien verstande dat, indien gedurende het tijdvak van opschorting geen gewone verkiezing van Bewindvoerders heeft plaatsgevonden, de Bewindvoerder aan de verkiezing van wie het lid vóór de opschorting had deelgenomen, of diens opvolger, gekozen in overeenstemming met paragraaf 3, letter c, punt i, van Schema L of met letter f hierboven, gerechtigd is het aan het lid toegewezen aantal stemmen uit te brengen. Het lid wordt geacht te hebben deelgenomen aan de verkiezing van de Bewindvoerder wanneer deze gerechtigd is het aantal aan het lid toegewezen stemmen uit te brengen.    

(j) De Raad van Bestuur stelt voorschriften vast, krachtens welke een lid dat niet ingevolge letter (b) hierboven gerechtigd is een Bewindvoerder te benoemen, iedere vergadering van het College van Bewindvoerders door een vertegenwoordiger kan doen bijwonen, waarin over een verzoek van dat lid of een vraagstuk waarbij het ten nauwste betrokken is, wordt beraadslaagd.   Sectie 4. *Directeur en staf* 

(a) Het College van Bewindvoerders wijst een Directeur aan die geen Bestuurder of Bewindvoerder is. De Directeur is voorzitter van het College van Bewindvoerders, maar heeft geen stem, behalve een beslissende stem in geval van staking van stemmen. Hij kan deelnemen aan de vergaderingen van de Raad van Bestuur, maar heeft in deze vergaderingen geen stemrecht. De Directeur treedt af wanneer het College van Bewindvoerders daartoe besluit.  

(b) De Directeur is het hoofd van de staf van het Fonds en leidt volgens de aanwijzingen van de Bewindvoerders de dagelijkse werkzaamheden van het Fonds. Onder het algemeen toezicht der Bewindvoerders is hij verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie, alsmede voor de benoeming en het ontslag van stafleden van het Fonds.  

(c) De Directeur en de staf van het Fonds staan bij het uitoefenen van hun functies uitsluitend in dienst van het Fonds en stellen hun diensten aan geen enkele andere autoriteit ter beschikking. Ieder lid van het Fonds eerbiedigt de internationale aard van deze dienstbetrekking en onthoudt zich van alle pogingen om een staflid bij de uitoefening van deze functies te beïnvloeden.  

(d) Bij het benoemen van het personeel wijdt de Directeur, rekening houdend met het overwegend belang van het verzekeren van een zo hoog mogelijk peil van efficiency en technische bekwaamheid, ten volle aandacht aan het belang, het personeel op zo breed mogelijke geografische basis aan te werven.   Sectie 5. *Stemrecht* 

(a) Het totale aantal stemmen van elk lid is gelijk aan de som van zijn basisstemmen en zijn op het quotum gebaseerde stemmen. 

(i) De basisstemmen van elk lid zijn gelijk aan het aantal stemmen dat voortvloeit uit de gelijke verdeling onder alle leden van 5,502 procent van het totale aantal stemmen van alle leden, met dien verstande dat er geen gedeelde basisstemmen zijn.  

(ii) Het aantal op het quotum gebaseerde stemmen van elk lid is gelijk aan het aantal stemmen dat voortvloeit uit de toekenning van een stem per deel van zijn quotum dat gelijk is aan honderdduizend bijzondere trekkingsrechten.    

(b) Wanneer met betrekking tot het bepaalde in artikel V, sectie 4 of 5 stemming is vereist, wordt het aantal stemmen waarop ieder lid ingevolge letter (a) hierboven recht heeft, aangepast: 

(i) door toevoeging van één stem voor ieder bedrag overeenkomende met vierhonderdduizend bijzondere trekkingsrechten van de netto-verkopen van zijn valuta uit de algemene middelen van het Fonds, tot de datum waarop wordt gestemd, of  

(ii) door vermindering met één stem voor ieder bedrag overeenkomende met vierhonderdduizend bijzondere trekkingsrechten van de netto-aankopen door een lid ingevolge artikel V, sectie 3 (b) en (f) tot de datum waarop wordt gestemd,   met dien verstande dat noch de netto-aankopen, noch de netto-verkopen worden geacht op enig ogenblik een bedrag gelijk aan het quotum van het betrokken lid te overschrijden.  

(c) Behalve wanneer specifiek anders bepaald, worden alle besluiten van het Fonds bij meerderheid van de uitgebrachte stemmen genomen.   Sectie 6. *Reserves, uitkering van de netto-winst en investering* 

(a) Het Fonds stelt jaarlijks vast welk deel van de netto-winst van het Fonds wordt toegevoegd aan de algemene reserve of de bijzondere reserve en welk deel eventueel zal worden uitgekeerd.  

(b) Het Fonds kan gebruik maken van de bijzondere reserve voor elk doel waartoe het de algemene reserve kan gebruiken, met uitzondering van uitkering.  

(c) Indien er een uitkering van de netto-winst van enig jaar plaatsvindt, wordt deze gedaan aan alle leden, naar verhouding van hun quota.  

(d) Het Fonds kan, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, te allen tijde besluiten een deel van de algemene reserve uit te keren. Elke zodanige uitkering dient te worden gedaan aan alle leden, naar verhouding van hun quota.  

(e) Betalingen ingevolge letters (c) en (d) hierboven worden gedaan in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, met dien verstande dat hetzij het Fonds, hetzij het lid kan besluiten dat de betaling aan het lid wordt gedaan in diens eigen valuta.  

(f) 

(i) Het Fonds kan een Investeringsrekening openen ten behoeve van het bepaalde in deze letter (f). De activa van de Investeringsrekening worden gescheiden gehouden van de andere rekeningen van de Algemene Afdeling.  

(ii) Het Fonds kan besluiten een deel van de opbrengst van de verkoop van goud in overeenstemming met artikel V, sectie 12 (g) over te maken op de Investeringsrekening en het kan, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, besluiten valuta's die staan geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening voor onmiddellijke investering over te maken op de Investeringsrekening. Het bedrag van deze overmakingen mag niet meer belopen dan het totale bedrag van de algemene reserve en de bijzondere reserve op het tijdstip van het besluit.  

(iii) Het Fonds kan de valuta van een lid, die geboekt staat op de Investeringsrekening, naar eigen inzicht gebruiken voor beleggingen, in overeenstemming met de door het Fonds, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale aantal stemmen, aangenomen voorschriften en regelingen. De ingevolge deze bepaling aangenomen voorschriften en regelingen dienen verenigbaar te zijn met (vii), (viii) en (ix) hieronder.  

(iv) De inkomsten uit investeringen kunnen worden belegd in overovereenstemming met het bepaalde in deze letter (f). Niet geïnvesteerde inkomsten worden geboekt op de Investeringsrekening of kunnen worden gebruikt ter bestrijding van de kosten van de leiding der zaken van het Fonds.  

(v) Het Fonds kan de valuta van een lid in de Investeringsrekening gebruiken om de valuta's te verkrijgen die nodig zijn ter bestrijding van de kosten van de leiding der zaken van het Fonds.  

(vi) De Investeringsrekening dient te worden afgesloten in het geval van liquidatie van het Fonds en kan worden afgesloten, of het bedrag van de investering kan worden verminderd, vóór de liquidatie van het Fonds, bij besluit met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale aantal stemmen.  

(vii) Na afsluiting van de Investeringsrekening wegens liquidatie van het Fonds worden alle eventuele activa in deze rekening uitgekeerd in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in schema K, met dien verstande dat een deel van deze activa, overeenstemmend met het percentage dat de ingevolge artikel V, sectie 12 (g) op deze rekening overgemaakte activa vormen van het totaal van de op deze rekening overgemaakte activa, wordt beschouwd als activa die geboekt staan op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening en wordt uitgekeerd in overeenstemming met schema K, paragraaf 2 (a) (ii).  

(viii) Na afsluiting van de Investeringsrekening vóór de liquidatie van het Fonds, wordt een deel van de activa, die op deze rekening staan geboekt, overeenstemmend met het percentage dat de ingevolge artikel V, sectie 12 (g) op deze rekening overgemaakte activa vormen van het totaal van de op deze rekening overgemaakte activa, overgemaakt op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening, indien deze niet is afgesloten, en het restant van de op de Investeringsrekening geboekte activa wordt overgemaakt op de Algemene Middelenrekening voor onmiddellijk gebruik bij verrichtingen en transacties.  

(ix) Bij een vermindering van het bedrag van de investeringen door het Fonds, wordt een deel van de vermindering, overeenstemmend met het deel dat de ingevolge artikel V, sectie 12 (g) op de Investeringsrekening overgemaakte activa vormen van het totaal van de op deze rekening overgemaakte activa, overgemaakt op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening, indien deze niet is afgesloten, en het restant van de vermindering wordt overgemaakt op de Algemene Middelenrekening voor onmiddellijk gebruik bij verrichtingen en transacties.     Sectie 7. *Publikatie van verslagen* 

(a) Het Fonds publiceert een jaarverslag, dat een door accountants gecontroleerde balans en winst- en verliesrekening bevat en geeft, met tussenpozen van drie maanden of korter, een beknopt overzicht van zijn verrichtingen en transacties en van zijn bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten, goud en valuta's van de leden.  

(b) Het Fonds kan die andere verslagen publiceren welke het voor de uitvoering van zijn taken wenselijk acht.   Sectie 8. *Mededeling van standpunten aan leden* Het Fonds heeft te allen tijde het recht zijn standpunten omtrent enige aangelegenheid in het kader van deze Overeenkomst informeel aan een lid mede te delen. Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal besluiten tot publikatie van een aan een lid uitgebracht verslag betreffende diens financiële of economische toestand en ontwikkeling, indien deze rechtstreeks een ernstige verstoring van het evenwicht in de internationale betalingsbalansen der leden zouden kunnen veroorzaken. Indien het lid niet is gerechtigd een Bewindvoerder te benoemen, is het in overeenstemming met sectie 3 (j) van dit artikel gerechtigd zich te laten vertegenwoordigen. Het Fonds publiceert geen rapport dat wijzigingen zou aangeven in de fundamentele structuur van het economisch bestel van leden.  

### Artikel  XIII  

####Kantoren en instanties van deponering

Sectie 1. *Plaats van vestiging der kantoren* Het Hoofdkantoor van het Fonds wordt gevestigd binnen het grondgebied van het lid dat het grootste quotum heeft en agentschappen of bijkantoren kunnen in de gebieden van andere leden worden gevestigd. Sectie 2. *Instanties van deponering* 

(a) Ieder lid wijst zijn Centrale Bank aan als instantie van deponering voor het totale bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta, of het wijst, indien het geen Centrale Bank bezit, een andere instelling aan die voor het Fonds aanvaardbaar is.  

(b) Het Fonds kan andere activa, met inbegrip van goud, in bewaring geven bij de instanties van deponering die door de vijf leden met de grootste quota zijn aangewezen en bij andere aangewezen instanties van deponering die het Fonds kiest. Aanvankelijk wordt minstens de helft van de bezittingen van het Fonds bewaard bij de instantie van deponering die door het lid binnen welks grondgebied het Fonds zijn hoofdkantoor heeft, is aangewezen, en ten minste veertig procent bij de instanties van deponering die door de overige vier hierboven genoemde leden zijn aangewezen. Alle overdrachten van goud door het Fonds worden echter verricht met gepaste inachtneming van de transportkosten en de verwachte behoeften van het Fonds. In onvoorziene omstandigheden kan het College van Bewindvoerders een deel of het geheel van het goudbezit van het Fonds naar iedere plaats overbrengen waar het doeltreffend kan worden beschermd.   Sectie 3. *Garantie der activa van het Fonds* Ieder lid garandeert alle activa van het Fonds tegen verlies ten gevolge van faillissement of het in gebreke blijven van de instelling die door hem als instantie van deponering is aangewezen.  

### Artikel  XIV  

####Overgangsregelingen

Sectie 1. *Kennisgeving aan het Fonds* Ieder lid brengt het Fonds ter kennis of het voornemens is gebruik te maken van de overgangsregelingen vervat in sectie 2 van dit artikel, dan wel of het bereid is de verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit artikel VIII, secties 2, 3 en 4 te aanvaarden. Een lid dat gebruik maakt van de overgangsregelingen, stelt, zo spoedig als het daarna bereid is deze verplichtingen te aanvaarden, het Fonds hiervan in kennis. Sectie 2. *Deviezenbeperkingen* Een lid dat het Fonds ter kennis heeft gebracht dat het voornemens is gebruik te maken van de in deze bepaling vervatte overgangsregelingen, kan, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in enig ander artikel van deze Overeenkomst, de beperkingen in de betalingen en overmakingen voor lopende internationale transacties die golden op de datum waarop het lid werd, handhaven en deze aanpassen aan de zich wijzigende omstandigheden. De leden houden echter bij hun buitenlandse valutabeleid voortdurend rekening met de doelstellingen van het Fonds en, zodra de omstandigheden het toelaten, nemen zij alle mogelijke maatregelen om commerciële en financiële regelingen met andere leden te treffen, die de internationale betalingen en de bevordering van een stabiel stelsel van wisselkoersen zullen vergemakkelijken. In het bijzonder heffen de leden de ingevolge deze sectie gehandhaafde beperkingen op, zodra zij tot de overtuiging zijn gekomen dat zij bij ontstentenis van zodanige beperkingen in staat zullen zijn hun betalingsbalans in een staat te brengen waardoor hun toegang tot de algemene middelen van het Fonds niet te zeer zou worden bemoeilijkt. Sectie 3. *Maatregelen van het Fonds ten aanzien van deviezenbeperkingen* Het Fonds brengt jaarlijks verslag uit over de ingevolge sectie 2 van dit artikel geldende beperkingen. Elk lid dat beperkingen hanteert die onverenigbaar zijn met artikel VIII, secties 2, 3 en 4, dient jaarlijks het Fonds te raadplegen ten aanzien van de verdere handhaving hiervan. Het Fonds kan, indien het een zodanige maatregel in uitzonderlijke omstandigheden noodzakelijk acht, aan een lid kenbaar maken dat de situatie gunstig is voor de opheffing van een bepaalde beperking of voor de algemene afschaffing van beperkingen die onverenigbaar zijn met het bepaalde in andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst. Aan het lid dient een passende termijn te worden gegeven om op een zodanige mededeling te antwoorden. Indien het Fonds tot de bevinding komt dat het lid desalniettemin beperkingen handhaaft die onverenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds, is artikel XXVI, sectie 2 (a) op dat lid van toepassing.  

### Artikel  XV  

####Bijzondere trekkingsrechten

Sectie 1. *Bevoegdheid tot het toewijzen van bijzondere trekkingsrechten* 

a. Ten einde te voorzien in de behoefte – wanneer en in de mate waarin deze zich voordoet – aan een aanvulling op de bestaande reservemiddelen, is het Fonds bevoegd bijzondere trekkingsrechten toe te wijzen, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Artikel XVIII, aan leden die participant zijn in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling.  

b. Bovendien wijst het Fonds bijzondere trekkingsrechten toe aan leden die, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van Schema M, participant zijn in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling.   Sectie 2. *Waardebepaling van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht* De wijze van waardebepaling van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht wordt door het Fonds bepaald met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, met dien verstande echter dat een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal vereist is voor een verandering in het beginsel van waardebepaling of voor een fundamentele verandering in de toepassing van het geldende beginsel.  

### Artikel  XVI  

####Algemene Afdeling en Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling

Sectie 1. *Scheiding van verrichtingen en transacties* Alle verrichtingen en transacties betreffende bijzondere trekkingsrechten lopen over de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling. Alle andere verrichtingen en transacties voor rekening van het Fonds, toegestaan bij of ingevolge deze Overeenkomst, lopen over de Algemene Afdeling. Verrichtingen en transacties uit hoofde van artikel XVII, sectie 2, lopen zowel over de Algemene Afdeling, als over de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling. Sectie 2. *Scheiding van activa en eigendommen* Alle activa en eigendommen van het Fonds, met uitzondering van middelen die worden beheerd ingevolge artikel V, sectie 2 (b), worden gehouden in de Algemene Afdeling, met dien verstande dat activa en eigendommen verworven ingevolge artikel XX, sectie 2 en de artikelen XXIV en XXV, alsmede de schema's H en I, worden gehouden in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling. Over activa en eigendommen gehouden in de ene Afdeling mag niet worden beschikt voor het betalen van de schulden en voor het voldoen aan de verplichtingen van het Fonds of voor het compenseren van zijn verliezen, welke schulden, verplichtingen of verliezen zijn ontstaan bij verrichtingen of transacties van de andere Afdeling, met dien verstande dat de kosten van het beheer van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling door het Fonds worden betaald uit de Algemene Afdeling, waarin van tijd tot tijd vergoedingen zullen worden gestort in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, door een aanslag ingevolge artikel XX, sectie 4, vastgesteld op basis van een redelijke raming van zodanige kosten. Sectie 3. *Boeking en inlichtingen* Veranderingen in het bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden eerst van kracht wanneer zij door het Fonds in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling zijn geboekt. Participanten geven het Fonds kennis van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst uit hoofde waarvan bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden gebruikt. Het Fonds kan van participanten eisen, dat zij alle verdere inlichtingen verstrekken die het Fonds voor zijn functies nodig acht.  

### Artikel  XVII  

####Participanten en andere houders van bijzondere trekkingsrechten

Sectie 1. *Participanten* Elk lid van het Fonds dat bij het Fonds een verklaring nederlegt, waarin wordt medegedeeld dat het overeenkomstig zijn nationale recht alle verplichtingen van een participant in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling op zich neemt en dat het alle stappen heeft genomen die nodig zijn opdat het al deze verplichtingen kan vervullen, wordt met ingang van de datum van nederlegging van de verklaring participant in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, met dien verstande dat een lid geen participant wordt voordat de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling van kracht zijn geworden en verklaringen ingevolge deze sectie zijn nedergelegd door leden die ten minste vijfenzeventig procent van het totaal der quota bezitten. Sectie 2. *Het Fonds als houder* Het Fonds kan bijzondere trekkingsrechten in de Algemene Middelenrekening bezitten en kan deze aanvaarden en gebruiken in verrichtingen en transacties met participanten, via de Algemene Middelenrekening, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst, dan wel met aangewezen houders, in overeenstemming met de ingevolge sectie 3 van dit artikel vastgestelde voorwaarden en bedingen. Sectie 3. *Andere houders* Het Fonds kan: 

(i) als houders aanwijzen, niet-leden, leden die geen participant zijn en instellingen die de functies van een centrale bank vervullen voor meer dan een lid, alsook andere officiële instanties;  

(ii) de voorwaarden en bedingen vaststellen waarop aan aangewezen houders kan worden toegestaan bijzondere trekkingsrechten te bezitten en waarop zij deze kunnen aanvaarden en gebruiken bij verrichtingen en transacties met participanten en andere aangewezen houders; en  

(iii) de voorwaarden en bedingen vaststellen waarop participanten en het Fonds via de Algemene Middelenrekening verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten kunnen aangaan met aangewezen houders.   Voor aanwijzingen ingevolge (i) hierboven is een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal vereist. De door het Fonds vastgestelde voorwaarden en bedingen dienen verenigbaar te zijn met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst en de doeltreffende werking van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling.  

### Artikel  XVIII  

####Toewijzing en intrekking van bijzondere trekkingsrechten

Sectie 1. *Beginselen en overwegingen bij toewijzing en intrekking* 

(a) Bij al zijn besluiten ten aanzien van de toewijzing en intrekking van bijzondere trekkingsrechten tracht het Fonds te voorzien in de mondiale behoefte op lange termijn, wanneer en in de mate waarin deze zich voordoet, om de bestaande reservemiddelen op zodanige wijze aan te te vullen dat het bereiken van zijn doelstellingen wordt bevorderd en economische stagnatie en deflatie, alsmede overmatige vraag en inflatie in de wereld worden vermeden.  

(b) Bij het eerste besluit tot toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden als bijzondere overwegingen in aanmerking genomen een gezamenlijk oordeel dat er een mondiale behoefte bestaat aan de aanvulling van de reserves, het bereiken van een beter betalingsbalansevenwicht alsmede de waarschijnlijkheid dat het aanpassingsproces in de toekomst beter zal verlopen.   Sectie *2. Toewijzing en intrekking* 

(a) Besluiten van het Fonds tot toewijzing of intrekking van bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden genomen voor achtereenvolgende basistijdvakken van vijf jaar. Het eerste basistijdvak vangt aan op de datum van het eerste besluit tot toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten of op een eventueel in dat besluit aangegeven latere datum. Toewijzingen of intrekkingen vinden plaats met tussenpozen van een jaar.  

(b) De toewijzingen worden uitgedrukt in percentages van de quota op de datum van elk besluit tot toewijzing. De intrekking van bijzondere trekkingsrechten wordt uitgedrukt in percentages van de netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten op de datum van elk besluit tot intrekking. De percentages zijn voor alle participanten gelijk.  

(c) In zijn besluit omtrent een basistijdvak kan het Fonds, niettegenstaande het bepaalde in letters (a) en (b) hierboven, bepalen: 

(i) dat het basistijdvak langer of korter dan vijf jaar zal zijn; of  

(ii) dat de toewijzingen of intrekkingen met andere dan jaarlijkse tussenpozen zullen plaatsvinden; of  

(iii) dat de grondslag voor toewijzingen of intrekkingen de quota of netto-cumulatieve toewijzingen zullen zijn op andere data dan de data van de besluiten tot toewijzing of intrekking.    

(d) Een lid dat participant wordt nadat een basistijdvak is aangevangen, ontvangt toewijzingen met ingang van het volgende basistijdvak waarin toewijzingen worden verricht, tenzij het Fonds besluit dat de nieuwe participant toewijzingen begint te ontvangen met ingang van de eerstvolgende toewijzing nadat het lid participant wordt. Indien het Fonds besluit dat een lid dat participant wordt tijdens een basistijdvak urende het resterende deel van het basistijdvak toewijzingen ontvangt en de participant geen lid was op de ingevolge letters (b) en (c) hierboven vastgestelde data, bepaalt het Fonds de grondslag waarop deze toewijzingen aan de participant zullen geschieden.  

(e) Een participant ontvangt toewijzingen van bijzondere trekkingsrechten krachtens een besluit tot toewijzing, tenzij: 

(i) de Bestuurder die de participant vertegenwoordigt niet vóór het besluit heeft gestemd; en  

(ii) de participant het Fonds vóór de eerste toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge dat besluit schriftelijk heeft medegedeeld dat hij geen toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge het besluit wenst te ontvangen. Op verzoek van een participant kan het Fonds besluiten de gelding van de kennisgeving te beëindigen wat betreft de toewijzingen van bijzondere trekkingsrechten na deze beëindiging.    

(f) Indien op de datum waarop een intrekking van kracht wordt het bedrag van de bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van een participant lager is dan zijn deel van de bijzondere trekkingsrechten die moeten worden ingetrokken, moet de participant zijn negatief saldo aanzuiveren zodra zijn bruto-reservepositie dit toelaat en hiertoe voortdurend overleg plegen met het Fonds. Bijzondere trekkingsrechten die door een participant zijn verworven na de datum waarop de intrekking van kracht wordt, worden verrekend met zijn negatief saldo en ingetrokken.   Sectie 3. *Onverwachte, ingrijpende ontwikkelingen* Het Fonds kan de percentages of de tussenpozen van toewijzing of intrekking voor het resterende deel van een basistijdvak of de duur van een basistijdvak wijzigen, dan wel een nieuw basistijdvak aanvangen, indien het te eniger tijd constateert dat onverwachte, ingrijpende ontwikkelingen zulks wenselijk doen zijn. Sectie 4. *Besluiten inzake toewijzingen en intrekkingen* 

(a) Besluiten ingevolge sectie 2 (a), (b) en (c) of sectie 3 van dit artikel worden genomen door de Raad van Bestuur op basis van voorstellen van de Directeur, die de instemming hebben van het College van Bewindvoerders.  

(b) Alvorens een voorstel in te dienen, pleegt de Directeur, nadat hij zich ervan heeft overtuigd dat het voorstel in overeenstemming zal zijn met het bepaalde in sectie 1 (a) van dit artikel, zodanig overleg dat hij zich ervan kan vergewissen dat de participanten zijn voorstel in ruime mate steunen. Alvorens een voorstel voor de eerste toewijzing te doen, overtuigt de Directeur zich voorts ervan dat is voldaan aan het bepaalde in sectie 1 (b) van dit artikel en dat de participanten de aanvang van toewijzingen in ruime mate steunen; zodra hij na de instelling van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling daarvan overtuigd is, doet hij een voorstel voor de eerste toewijzing.  

(c) De Directeur doet voorstellen: 

(i) uiterlijk zes maanden voor het einde van elk basistijdvak;  

(ii) indien geen besluit is genomen ten aanzien van toewijzing of intrekking voor een basistijdvak, wanneer hij ervan overtuigd is dat is voldaan aan het bepaalde in letter (b) hierboven;  

(iii) wanneer hij, overeenkomstig sectie 3 van dit artikel, van mening is dat het wenselijk zou zijn de percentages of de tussenpozen van toewijzing of intrekking, dan wel de duur van een basistijdvak te wijzigen of een nieuw basistijdvak aan te vangen; of  

(iv) binnen zes maanden na een verzoek van de Raad van Bestuur of het College van Bewindvoerders;   met dien verstande dat, indien de Directeur ingevolge (i), (iii) of (iv) hierboven vaststelt dat er geen voorstel is dat naar zijn oordeel in overeenstemming is met het bepaalde in sectie 1 van dit artikel en dat tevens in ruime mate wordt gesteund door de participanten overeenkomstig letter (b) hierboven, hij verslag uitbrengt aan de Raad van Bestuur en het College van Bewindvoerders.  

(d) Voor besluiten ingevolge sectie 2 (a), (b) en (c) of sectie 3 van dit artikel, met uitzondering van besluiten ingevolge sectie 3 ten aanzien van een verlaging van het toewijzingspercentage, is een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal nodig.    

### Artikel  XIX  

####Verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten

Sectie 1. *Gebruik van bijzondere trekkingsrechten* Bijzondere trekkingsrechten kunnen worden gebruikt bij de verrichtingen en transacties toegestaan bij of ingevolge deze Overeenkomst Sectie 2. *Verrichtingen en transacties tussen participanten* 

(a) Een participant heeft het recht zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten te gebruiken om een equivalent bedrag aan valuta te verkrijgen van een ingevolge sectie 5 van dit artikel aangewezen participant.  

(b) In overeenstemming met een andere participant kan een participant zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten gebruiken ten einde een equivalent bedrag aan valuta van de andere participant te verkrijgen.  

(c) Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal verrichtingen bepalen waaraan een participant gemachtigd is deel te nemen in overeenstemming met een andere participant, op voorwaarden en bedingen die het Fonds passend acht. De voorwaarden en bedingen dienen verenigbaar te zijn met de doeltreffende werking van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling en het juiste gebruik van bijzondere trekkingsrechten in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst.  

(d) Het Fonds kan aan een participant die deelneemt aan een verrichting of transactie ingevolge letter (b) of (c) hierboven, welke, naar het oordeel van het Fonds nadelig kan zijn voor het aanwijzingsproces overeenkomstig de beginselen vervat in sectie 5 van dit artikel, dan wel anderszins onverenigbaar is met artikel XXII, zulks kenbaar maken. Op een participant die volhardt in het deelnemen aan zodanige verrichtingen of transacties is artikel XXIII, sectie 2 (b) van toepassing.   Sectie 3. *Vereiste van behoefte* 

(a) Bij transacties ingevolge sectie 2 (a) van dit artikel, behalve zoals anders bepaald in letter (c) hieronder, zal van een participant worden verwacht dat hij zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten alleen gebruikt indien dit voor hem nodig is om wille van zijn betalingsbalans- of reservepositie, dan wel in verband met ontwikkelingen in zijn reserves en niet uitsluitend ten behoeve van het veranderen van de samenstelling van zijn reserves.  

(b) Het gebruik van bijzondere trekkingsrechten kan niet worden aangevochten op grond van de verwachting bedoeld in letter (a) hierboven, doch het Fonds kan aan een participant die niet aan deze verwachting voldoet zulks kenbaar maken. Op een participant die in gebreke blijft aan deze verwachting te voldoen, is artikel XXIII, sectie 2 (b) van toepassing.  

(c) Het Fonds kan de in letter (a) hierboven vervatte verwachting terzijde stellen, bij alle transacties waarin een participant gebruik maakt van bijzondere trekkingsrechten om een equivalent bedrag aan valuta te verkrijgen van een ingevolge sectie 5 van dit artikel aangewezen participant, ter bevordering van de reconstitutie door de andere participant ingevolge sectie 6 (a) van dit artikel, ter voorkoming of vermindering van een negatief saldo van de andere participant, dan wel om de gevolgen van het in gebreke blijven van de andere participant om aan de in letter (a) hierboven vervatte verwachting te voldoen, ongedaan te maken.   Sectie 4. *Verplichting tot het verstrekken van valuta* 

(a) Een door het Fonds ingevolge sectie 5 van dit artikel aangewezen participant verstrekt op verzoek een vrij te gebruiken valuta aan een participant die bijzondere trekkingsrechten gebruikt overeenkomstig sectie 2 (a) van dit artikel. De verplichting van een participant om valuta te verstrekken, strekt zich niet verder uit dan het punt waarop zijn bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten boven zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing gelijk is aan twee maal zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing; of die hogere grens die een participant en het Fonds kunnen overeenkomen.  

(b) Een participant kan valuta verstrekken boven de verplichte grens of iedere overeengekomen hogere grens.   Sectie 5. *Aanwijzing van participanten die valuta moeten verstrekken* 

(a) Het Fonds verzekert dat een participant zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten kan gebruiken; het wijst daartoe participanten aan die valuta moeten verstrekken tegen aangegeven bedragen aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten voor de doeleinden van de secties 2 (a) en 4 van dit artikel. De aanwijzing geschiedt overeenkomstig de volgende algemene beginselen, aangevuld met eventuele andere beginselen die het Fonds van tijd tot tijd kan vaststellen: 

(i) Een participant kan worden aangewezen, indien zijn betalingsbalans en zijn bruto-reservepositie voldoende sterk zijn, doch dit sluit niet de mogelijkheid uit dat een participant met een sterke reservepositie wordt aangewezen hoewel hij een matig tekort op zijn betalingsbalans heeft. Participanten worden op zodanige wijze aangewezen dat hierdoor na verloop van tijd een evenwichtige verdeling van het bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten tussen hen wordt bevorderd.  

(ii) Participanten kunnen worden aangewezen ten einde het herstel van de oorspronkelijke positie ingevolge sectie 6 (a) van dit artikel te bevorderen, ten einde negatieve saldi van bijzondere trekkingsrechten te verminderen, of ten einde de gevolgen van het in gebreke blijven om te voldoen aan de verwachting vervat in sectie 3 (a) van dit artikel ongedaan te maken.  

(iii) Bij de aanwijzing van participanten geeft het Fonds gewoonlijk voorrang aan degenen die bijzondere trekkingsrechten moeten verwerven ten einde de doeleinden van aanwijzing ingevolge (ii) hierboven te verwezenlijken.    

(b) Ten einde te bevorderen dat na verloop van tijd een evenwichtige verdeling van het bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge letter (a) (i) hierboven tot stand komt, past het Fonds de voorschriften voor aanwijzing in schema F toe, ofwel de voorschriften die kunnen worden vastgesteld ingevolge letter (c) hieronder.  

(c) De voorschriften voor aanwijzing kunnen te allen tijde opnieuw worden bezien en zonodig worden nieuwe voorschriften vastgesteld. Tenzij nieuwe voorschriften worden vastgesteld, blijven de tot dan van kracht zijnde voorschriften van toepassing.   Sectie 6. *Reconstitutie* 

(a) Participanten die hun bijzondere trekkingsrechten gebruiken, moeten hun bezit daarvan reconstitueren overeenkomstig de desbetreffende voorschriften in schema G of de voorschriften die kunnen worden vastgesteld ingevolge letter (b) hieronder.  

(b) De voorschriften voor de reconstitutie kunnen te allen tijde opnieuw worden bezien en zonodig worden nieuwe voorschriften vastgesteld. Tenzij nieuwe voorschriften worden vastgesteld of wordt besloten tot intrekking van voorschriften voor de reconstitutie, blijven de tot dan van kracht zijnde voorschriften van toepassing. Er is een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal nodig voor besluiten om de voorschriften betreffende de reconstitutie vast te stellen, te wijzigen of in te trekken.   Sectie 7. *Wisselkoersen* 

(a) Tenzij anders bepaald in letter (b) hieronder, moeten de wisselkoersen voor transacties tussen participanten ingevolge sectie 2 (a) en (b) van dit artikel zodanig zijn, dat participanten die bijzondere trekkingsrechten gebruiken dezelfde waarde ontvangen, ongeacht welke valuta's zouden worden verstrekt en welke participanten deze valuta's verstrekken; het Fonds stelt regelingen vast voor de toepassing van dit beginsel.  

(b) Het Fonds kan met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal beleidslijnen vaststellen krachtens welke het Fonds in uitzonderlijke omstandigheden met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal participanten die ingevolge sectie 2 (b) van dit artikel transacties aangaan, kan machtigen andere wisselkoersen overeen te komen dan die welke ingevolge letter (a) hierboven van toepassing zijn.  

(c) Het Fonds pleegt overleg met een participant over de methode van vaststelling van wisselkoersen voor zijn valuta.  

(d) Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling omvat de uitdrukking participant mede een zich terugtrekkende participant.    

### Artikel  XX  

####Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, rente en provisies

Sectie 1. *Rente* Het Fonds betaalt rente volgens een voor alle houders gelijke rentevoet aan elke houder over het bedrag van zijn bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Het Fonds betaalt het aan elke houder verschuldigde bedrag, ongeacht of er voldoende provisie is ontvangen om rente uit te keren. Sectie 2. *Provisies* Elke participant betaalt aan het Fonds provisies volgens een voor alle participanten gelijk tarief over het bedrag van zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten, vermeerderd met een eventueel negatief saldo van de participant of niet betaalde provisies. Sectie 3. *Rentevoet en hoogte van de provisies* Het Fonds bepaalt de rentevoet met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal. De hoogte van de provisies is gelijk aan de rentevoet. Sectie 4. *Aanslagen* Indien ingevolge artikel XVI, sectie 2 wordt besloten dat vergoedingen worden betaald, legt het Fonds hiertoe aanslagen op volgens het voor alle participanten gelijke tarief op hun netto-cumulatieve toewijzingen. Sectie 5. *Betaling van rente, provisies en aanslagen* Rente, provisies en aanslagen worden betaald in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Een participant die bijzondere trekkingsrechten nodig heeft om een provisie of aanslag te betalen is verplicht en gerechtigd deze tegen een voor het Fonds aanvaardbare valuta te verwerven in een transactie met het Fonds via de Algemene Middelenrekening. Indien op deze wijze niet voldoende bijzondere trekkingsrechten kunnen worden verworven, is de participant verplicht en gerechtigd deze met een vrij te gebruiken valuta te verwerven van een participant die door het Fonds wordt aangewezen. Door een participant na de betalingsdatum verworven bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden verrekend met zijn onbetaalde provisies en ingetrokken.  

### Artikel  XXI  

####Beheer van de Algemene Afdeling en de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling

(a).  De Algemene Afdeling en de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling worden beheerd overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel XII, met inachtneming van onderstaande bepalingen: 

(i) voor vergaderingen of besluiten van de Raad van Bestuur betreffende aangelegenheden die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling wordt voor het bijeenroepen van vergaderingen en het vaststellen of een quorum aanwezig is dan wel of een besluit met de vereiste meerderheid is genomen, alleen rekening gehouden met verzoeken van of de aanwezigheid en stemmen van Bestuurders benoemd door leden die participant zijn.  

(ii) Voor besluiten van het College van Bewindvoerders betreffende aangelegenheden die uitsluitend betrekking hebben op de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling hebben alleen Bewindvoerders die zijn benoemd of gekozen door ten minste één lid dat participant is, het recht hun stem uit te brengen. Ieder dezer Bewindvoerders heeft het recht het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat is toegewezen aan het lid-participant dat hem heeft benoemd, of aan de leden die participant zijn en wier stemmen hebben meegeteld bij zijn verkiezing. Voor het vaststellen of een quorum aanwezig is dan wel een besluit wordt genomen met de vereiste meerderheid, wordt alleen rekening gehouden met de aanwezigheid van Bewindvoerders benoemd of gekozen door leden die participant zijn en de aan leden die participant zijn toegewezen stemmen. Voor de toepassing van deze bepaling verschaft een overeenkomst ingevolge artikel XII, sectie 3 letter (i), (ii) van een lid dat participant is, aan een benoemde Bewindvoerder het recht te stemmen en het aan het lid toegewezen aantal stemmen uit te brengen.  

(iii) Over vraagstukken betreffende het algemene beheer van het Fonds, met inbegrip van de vergoedingen ingevolge artikel XVI, sectie 2, en over de vraag of een aangelegenheid beide afdelingen, dan wel uitsluitend de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling betreft, wordt beslist alsof zij uitsluitend betrekking hadden op de Algemene Afdeling. Besluiten ten aanzien van de wijze van waardebepaling van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht, de aanvaarding en het bezit van bijzondere trekkingsrechten in de Algemene Middelenrekening van de Algemene Afdeling en het gebruik daarvan, alsmede andere besluiten omtrent de verrichtingen en transacties die lopen over zowel de Algemene Middelenrekening van de Algemene Afdeling als de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, worden genomen met de meerderheid vereist voor besluiten over aangelegenheden die uitsluitend elke Afdeling betreffen. Indien een besluit betrekking heeft op een aangelegenheid betreffende de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeiing moet zulks daarin worden aangegeven.     
(b).  Naast de voorrechten en immuniteiten die zijn toegekend ingevolge artikel IX van deze Overeenkomst wordt bovendien generlei belasting geheven op bijzondere trekkingsrechten of op verrichtingen of transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten.   
(c).  Een vraagstuk betreffende de interpretatie van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst in aangelegenheden die uitsluitend de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling betreffen, wordt overeenkomstig artikel XXIX (a) alleen op verzoek van een participant voorgelegd aan het College van Bewindvoerders. In elk geval waarin het College van Bewindvoerders zich heeft uitgesproken over een interpretatievraagstuk dat uitsluitend de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling betreft, kan alleen een participant eisen dat de aangelegenheid wordt verwezen naar de Raad van Bestuur ingevolge artikel XXIX (b). De Raad van Bestuur besluit of een Bestuurder benoemd door een lid dat geen participant is, gerechtigd is in de Interpretatiecommissie zijn stem uit te brengen over vraagstukken die uitsluitend de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling betreffen.   
(d).  Wanneer ten aanzien van enigerlei aangelegenheid die uitsluitend voortvloeit uit participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling een meningsverschil ontstaat tussen het Fonds en een participant die zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling heeft beëindigd of tussen het Fonds en enige participant tijdens de liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, wordt het meningsverschil onderworpen aan arbitrage overeenkomstig de procedures vervat in artikel XXIX (c).   

### Artikel  XXII  

####Algemene verplichtingen van participanten

Naast de verplichtingen aangegaan ten aanzien van bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingevolge andere artikelen van deze Overeenkomst, verplicht elke participant zich bovendien met het Fonds en met andere participanten samen te werken ten einde de doeltreffende werking van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling en het juiste gebruik van bijzondere trekkingsrechten te vergemakkelijken, in overeenstemming met deze Overeenkomst en met de doelstelling de bijzondere trekkingsrechten te maken tot het voornaamste reservemiddel in het internationale monetaire stelsel.  

### Artikel  XXIII  

####Opschorting van verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten

Sectie 1. *Noodmaatregelen* Ingeval een noodtoestand of de ontwikkeling van onvoorziene omstandigheden de werkzaamheden van het Fonds met betrekking tot de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling bedreigen, kan het College van Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal voor een tijdvak van ten hoogste één jaar, de werking opschorten van enigerlei bepaling betreffende verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten; in dat geval is het bepaalde in artikel XXVII, sectie 1 (b), (c) en (d) van toepassing. Sectie 2. *Het niet nakomen van verplichtingen* 

(a) Indien het Fonds constateert dat een participant heeft nagelaten zijn verplichtingen ingevolge artikel XIX, sectie 4 na te komen, wordt het recht van de participant zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten te gebruiken, opgeschort, tenzij het Fonds anders besluit.  

(b) Indien het Fonds constateert dat een participant heeft nagelaten enige andere verplichting ten aanzien van de bijzondere trekkingsrechten na te komen, kan het Fonds het recht van de participant om gebruik te maken van bijzondere trekkingsrechten die hij na de opschorting verwerft, opschorten.  

(c) Er worden regelingen vastgesteld om te verzekeren dat, alvorens tegen enige participant maatregelen worden genomen ingevolge letter (a) of (b) hierboven, de participant onmiddellijk van het tegen hem ingebrachte bezwaar in kennis wordt gesteld en behoorlijk gelegenheid krijgt zijn standpunt, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk, uiteen te zetten. Indien de participant op deze wijze in kennis is gesteld van een bezwaar betreffende letter (a) hierboven, gebruikt hij, in afwachting van de beschikking op de bezwaren, geen bijzondere trekkingsrechten.  

(d) Opschorting ingevolge letter (a) of (b) hierboven of beperking ingevolge letter (c) hierboven is niet van invloed op de verplichting van de participant valuta ter beschikking te stellen overeenkomstig artikel XIX, sectie 4.  

(e) Het Fonds kan te allen tijde een opschorting ingevolge letter (a) of (b) hierboven beëindigen, met dien verstande dat een opschorting opgelegd aan een participant ingevolge letter (b) hierboven wegens het niet nakomen van de verplichtingen ingevolge artikel XIX, sectie 6 (a), eerst 180 dagen na het einde van het eerste kalenderkwartaal tijdens hetwelk de participant de voorschriften voor herstel van de oorspronkelijke positie naleeft, wordt beëindigd.  

(f) Het recht van een participant zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten te gebruiken wordt niet opgeschort wegens het feit dat hij ingevolge artikel V, sectie 5, artikel VI, sectie 1, of artikel XXVI, sectie 2 (a) niet langer bevoegd is de middelen van het Fonds te gebruiken. Het feit dat een participant heeft nagelaten enigerlei verplichting ten aanzien van bijzondere trekkingsrechten na te komen, levert geen grond voor toepassing van artikel XXVI, sectie 2.    

### Artikel  XXIV  

####Beëindiging van participatie

Sectie 1. *Het recht participatie te beëindigen* 

(a) Een participant kan zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te allen tijde beëindigen door hiervan schriftelijke kennisgeving te zenden aan het hoofdkantoor van het Fonds. De beëindiging gaat in op de datum van ontvangst van de kennisgeving.  

(b) Een participant die uit het Fonds treedt, wordt geacht tegelijkertijd zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te hebben beëindigd.   Sectie 2. *Afrekening bij beëindiging* 

(a) Indien een participant zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling beëindigt, houden alle verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten van de zich terugtrekkende participant op, behalve indien toegestaan uit hoofde van een overeenkomst aangegaan ingevolge letter (c) hieronder ten einde een vereffening te vergemakkelijken, of zoals bepaald in secties 3, 5 en 6 van dit artikel dan wel in schema H. Rente en provisies verschuldigd tot de datum van beëindiging en voor die datum opgelegde doch niet betaalde aanslagen worden betaald in bijzondere trekkingsrechten.  

(b) Het Fonds is verplicht alle bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van de zich terugtrekkende participant terug te kopen en de zich terugtrekkende participant is verplicht het Fonds een bedrag te betalen gelijk aan zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing en eventuele andere bedragen die verschuldigd zijn en moeten worden betaald wegens zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling. Deze verplichtingen worden onderling verrekend en het bedrag aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van de zich terugtrekkende participant dat bij de verrekening wordt gebruikt om te voldoen aan zijn verplichtingen aan het Fonds, wordt ingetrokken.  

(c) Bij overeenkomst tussen de zich terugtrekkende participant en het Fonds vindt met redelijke spoed een vereffening plaats ten aanzien van enigerlei verplichtingen van de zich terugtrekkende participant of het Fonds na de verrekening in letter (b) hierboven. Indien niet terstond overeenstemming wordt bereikt, is het bepaalde in schema H van toepassing.   Sectie 3. *Rente en provisies* Na de datum van beëindiging betaalt het Fonds rente over een eventueel nog openstaand saldo van bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van een zich terugtrekkende participant en betaalt de zich terugtrekkende participant provisies over een eventuele nog tegenover het Fonds bestaande verplichting op de tijdstippen en volgens de tarieven voorgeschreven in artikel XX. Betaling geschiedt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Een zich terugtrekkende participant heeft het recht, ter betaling van provisies of aanslagen bijzondere trekkingsrechten te verkrijgen met een vrij te gebruiken valuta in een transactie met een door het Fonds aangewezen participant, of, bij overeenkomst, van een andere houder, dan wel zich van bijzondere trekkingsrechten die als rente zijn ontvangen, te ontdoen in een transactie met een participant aangewezen ingevolge artikel XIX, sectie 5 of, bij overeenkomst, met enige andere houder. Sectie 4. *Het voldoen aan een verplichting jegens het Fonds* Valuta ontvangen door het Fonds van een zich terugtrekkende participant wordt door het Fonds gebruikt om bijzondere trekkingsrechten die in het bezit van de participanten zijn, terug te kopen en wel naar evenredigheid van het bedrag waarmede het bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten van elke deelnemer zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing overschrijdt op het tijdstip waarop het Fonds de valuta ontvangt. De op deze wijze teruggekochte bijzondere trekkingsrechten, alsmede de bijzondere trekkingsrechten die een zich terugtrekkende participant verkrijgt ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst ten einde een termijn te voldoen die is verschuldigd ingevolge een overeenkomst inzake verrekening of ingevolge schema H en die worden verrekend met deze termijn, worden ingetrokken. Sectie 5. *Het voldoen aan een verplichting jegens een zich terugtrekkende participant* Indien het Fonds bijzondere trekkingsrechten dient terug te kopen die in het bezit zijn van een zich terugtrekkende participant, geschiedt deze terugkoop met valuta verstrekt door participanten die door het Fonds zijn aangewezen. Deze participanten worden aangewezen overeenkomstig de beginselen vervat in artikel XIX, sectie 5. Elke aangewezen participant verstrekt aan het Fonds naar eigen keuze de valuta van de zich terugtrekkende participant of een vrij te gebruiken valuta en ontvangt een equivalent bedrag aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Indien het Fonds dit toestaat, kan een zich terugtrekkende participant zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten evenwel gebruiken om van enige houder zijn eigen valuta, een vrij te gebruiken valuta of enigerlei andere activa te verkrijgen. Sectie 6. *Transacties via de Algemene Middelenrekening* Ter vergemakkelijking van de vereffening met een zich terugtrekkende participant kan het Fonds beslissen dat een zich terugtrekkende participant: 

(i) bijzondere trekkingsrechten die hij bezit na de verrekening in sectie 2 (b) van dit artikel, indien zij moeten worden teruggekocht, dient te gebruiken in een transactie met het Fonds via de Algemene Middelenrekening ten einde zijn eigen valuta of een vrij te gebruiken valuta te verkrijgen al naar de keuze van het Fonds; of  

(ii) bijzondere trekkingsrechten dient te verkrijgen in een transactie met het Fonds via de Algemene Middelenrekening tegen een voor het Fonds aanvaardbare valuta ten einde provisies of termijnen te betalen die verschuldigd zijn ingevolge schema H.    

### Artikel  XXV  

####Liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling

(a) De Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling mag slechts bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur worden geliquideerd. In een noodtoestand kan het College van Bewindvoerders, indien dit tot het inzicht komt dat liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling nodig kan zijn, alle toewijzingen of intrekkingen en alle verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten tijdelijk opschorten, hangende een besluit van de Raad van Bestuur. Een besluit van de Raad van Bestuur om het Fonds te liquideren, vormt een besluit om zowel de Algemene Afdeling als de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te liquideren.  

(b) Indien de Raad van Bestuur besluit de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te liquideren, houden alle toewijzingen of intrekkingen en alle verrichtingen en transacties in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, alsmede de werkzaamheden van het Fonds met betrekking tot de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling op, behalve die welke nodig zijn voor het ordelijk afwikkelen van de verplichtingen van participanten en van het Fonds ten aanzien van bijzondere trekkingsrechten en komen alle verplichtingen van het Fonds en van participanten ingevolge deze Overeenkomst ten aanzien van bijzondere trekkingsrechten te vervallen, behalve die welke zijn vervat in dit artikel, in artikel XX, artikel XXI (d), artikel XXIV, artikel XXIX (c) en schema H of enigerlei overeenkomst die tot stand is gekomen ingevolge artikel XXIV, behoudens het bepaalde in schema H, paragraaf 4 en schema I.  

(c) Bij liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling worden tot de datum van liquidatie verschuldigde provisies en vóór die datum opgelegde doch niet betaalde aanslagen betaald in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Het Fonds is verplicht alle bijzondere trekkingsrechten van houders terug te kopen en elke participant is verplicht het Fonds een bedrag te betalen gelijk aan zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten alsmede andere bedragen die eventueel zijn verschuldigd en moeten worden betaald wegens zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling.  

(d) De liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling vindt plaats volgens het bepaalde in schema I.    

### Artikel  XXVI  

####Opzegging van het lidmaatschap

Sectie 1. *Opzeggingsrecht van de leden* Ieder lid kan te allen tijde uit het Fonds treden door een schriftelijke kennisgeving aan het hoofdkantoor van het Fonds te doen toekomen. De opzegging gaat in op de dag van ontvangst van een zodanige mededeling. Sectie 2. *Gedwongen uittreding* 

a. Indien een lid nalaat een van zijn verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit deze Overeenkomst na te komen, kan het Fonds het lid het recht ontzeggen gebruik te maken van de algemene middelen van het Fonds. Niets in dit artikel wordt geacht het bepaalde in artikel V, sectie 5, of artikel VI, sectie 1, te beperken.  

b. Indien het lid na verloop van een redelijke termijn na een ontzegging krachtens letter a hierboven nog steeds nalaat een van zijn verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit de Overeenkomst na te komen, kan het Fonds, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, het stemrecht van het lid opschorten. Gedurende het tijdvak van opschorting zijn de bepalingen van Schema L van toepassing. Het Fonds kan, met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal, de opschorting te allen tijde beëindigen.  

c. Indien het lid na verloop van een redelijke termijn na een besluit tot opschorting krachtens letter b hierboven nog steeds nalaat een van zijn verplichtingen voortvloeiend uit deze Overeenkomst na te komen, kan dat lid, bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur - genomen door een meerderheid van de Bestuurders die gezamenlijk vijfentachtig procent van het stemmenaantal bezitten - worden verzocht het lidmaatschap van het Fonds op te zeggen.  

d. Er worden regelingen vastgesteld om te verzekeren dat, alvorens tegen enig lid maatregelen worden genomen ingevolge letter a, b of c hierboven, het lid binnen een redelijke termijn van het tegen hem ingebrachte bezwaar in kennis wordt gesteld en behoorlijk gelegenheid krijgt zijn standpunt, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk, uiteen te zetten.   Sectie 3. *Vereffening der rekeningen met uitgetreden leden* Wanneer een lid zich uit het Fonds terugtrekt, houden de normale verrichtingen en transacties van het Fonds in zijn valuta op en vindt vereffening plaats van alle rekeningen die tussen het lid en het Fonds bestaan, zulks met redelijke spoed en bij overeenkomst tussen het lid en het Fonds. Indien niet terstond overeenstemming wordt bereikt, is het bepaalde in schema J van toepassing op de vereffening der rekeningen.  

### Artikel  XXVII  

####Noodmaatregelen

Sectie 1. *Tijdelijke opschorting* 

(a) Ingeval een noodtoestand of de ontwikkeling van onvoorziene omstandigheden de werkzaamheden van het Fonds bedreigen, kan het College van Bewindvoerders met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal voor een tijdvak van ten hoogste één jaar de werking van enigerlei van de navolgende bepalingen opschorten: 

(i) artikel V, secties 2, 3, 7, 8 (a) (i) en (e);  

(ii) artikel VI, sectie 2;  

(iii) artikel XI, sectie 1;  

(iv) schema C, paragraaf 5.    

(b) Een opschorting van de werking van een bepaling ingevolge letter (a) hierboven kan niet worden verlengd tot meer dan een jaar, behalve door de Raad van Bestuur die met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal een opschorting kan verlengen voor een verdere periode van ten hoogste twee jaar, indien hij constateert dat de in letter (a) hierboven bedoelde noodtoestand of onvoorziene omstandigheden voortduren.  

(c) Het College van Bewindvoerders mag met een meerderheid van het totale stemmenaantal te allen tijde een zodanige opschorting beeindigen.  

(d) Het Fonds kan voorschriften vaststellen met betrekking tot het voorwerp van een bepaling gedurende het tijdvak waarin de werking hiervan is opgeschort.   Sectie 2. *Liquidatie van het Fonds* 

(a) Het Fonds mag slechts bij besluit van de Raad van Bestuur worden geliquideerd. In een noodtoestand kan het College van Bewindvoerders, indien dit tot het inzicht komt dat liquidatie van het Fonds nodig kan zijn, alle verrichtingen en transacties tijdelijk opschorten, hangende een besluit van de Raad van Bestuur.

### Artikel  XXVIII  

####Wijzigingen

(a).  Ieder voorstel betreffende het aanbrengen van wijzigingen in deze Overeenkomst wordt, ongeacht of het afkomstig is van een lid, een Bestuurder of het College van Bewindvoerders, ingediend bij de voorzitter van de Raad van Bestuur, die het voorstel voorlegt aan de Raad van Bestuur. Indien de voorgestelde wijziging door de Raad van Bestuur wordt goedgekeurd, vraagt het Fonds bij rondschrijven of per telegram alle leden of zij de voorgestelde wijziging aanvaarden. Wanneer drie vijfde van de leden die te zamen vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal bezitten, de voorgestelde wijziging hebben aanvaard, geeft het Fonds hiervan kennis door een officiële mededeling daarvan aan alls leden te zenden.   
(b).  Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in letter (a) hierboven, is aanvaarding door alle leden noodzakelijk wanneer het een wijziging betreft aangaande: 

(i) het recht om uit het Fonds te treden (artikel XXVI, sectie 1);  

(ii) de bepaling dat het quotum van een lid niet mag worden gewijzigd zonder zijn toestemming (artikel III, sectie 2 (d)); en  

(iii) de bepaling dat de pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid niet mag worden gewijzigd, tenzij op voorstel van dat lid (schema C, paragraaf 6).     
(c).  Wijzigingen worden voor alle leden drie maanden na de datum van de officiële mededeling van kracht, tenzij in het rondschrijven of het telegram een kortere termijn is bepaald.   

### Artikel  XXIX  

####Interpretatie

(a).  Ieder meningsverschil dat omtrent de interpretatie van de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst tussen enig lid en het Fonds of tussen de leden onderling ontstaat, wordt aan het College van Bewindvoerders ter beslissing voorgelegd. Indien enig lid dat niet is gerechtigd een Bewindvoerder te benoemen ten nauwste bij het meningsverschil is betrokken, heeft het het recht zich te laten vertegenwoordigen overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel XII, sectie 3 (j).   
(b).  In elk geval waarin het College van Bewindvoerders ingevolge letter (a) hierboven een beslissing heeft genomen, mag ieder lid binnen drie maanden na de datum van de beslissing verzoeken dat het vraagstuk wordt verwezen naar de Raad van Bestuur, wiens beslissing bindend zal zijn. Een vraagstuk verwezen naar de Raad van Bestuur wordt onderzocht door een Interpretatiecommissie van de Raad van Bestuur. Elk Commissielid heeft een stem. De Raad van Bestuur bepaalt het lidmaatschap, de procedures en de meerderheid bij stemming van de Commissie. Een beslissing van de Commissie geldt als een beslissing van de Raad van Bestuur, tenzij de Raad van Bestuur met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal anders beslist. Hangende de uitslag van de verwijzing naar de Raad van Bestuur kan het Fonds, voor zover het dit noodzakelijk acht, op basis van de beslissing van het College van Bewindvoerders handelen.   
(c).  Telkens wanneer er onenigheid ontstaat tussen het Fonds en een lid dat is uitgetreden, of tussen het Fonds en enig lid tijdens de liquidatie van het Fonds, wordt een zodanige onenigheid onderworpen aan een scheidsrechterlijke beslissing door een gerecht van drie scheidsmannen, van wie één door het Fonds wordt benoemd, een andere door het lid of het uittredende lid en een, de scheidsrechter, door de President van het Internationaal Gerechtshof of een andere autoriteit die daarvoor bij een door het Fonds vastgestelde regeling is aangewezen, tenzij partijen anders overeenkomen. De scheidsrechter heeft volledige bevoegdheid om in alle vragen betreffende de procedure te beslissen, wanneer naar aanleiding daarvan onenigheid tussen partijen bestaat.

### 1  

Wederinkoopverplichtingen die ingevolge artikel V, sectie 7 (b) zijn ontstaan vóór de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst en waaraan op die datum nog niet is voldaan, dienen uiterlijk te worden nagekomen op de datum of data waarop de verplichtingen moesten worden nagekomen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst vóór de tweede wijziging.  

### 2  

Een lid voldoet met bijzondere trekkingsrechten aan elke verplichting om goud te betalen aan het Fonds uit hoofde van wederinkoop of als bijdrage die nog niet is geleverd op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, maar het Fonds kan voorschrijven dat deze betalingen geheel of gedeeltelijk mogen worden verricht in de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden. Een niet-participant voldoet aan een verplichting ingevolge deze bepaling om in bijzondere trekkingsrechten te betalen met de door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta's van andere leden.  

### 3  

Voor de toepassing van paragraaf 2 hierboven is 0,888.671 gram fijn goud equivalent aan een bijzonder trekkingsrecht en het ingevolge paragraaf 2 hierboven te betalen bedrag aan valuta wordt vastgesteld op die basis en op basis van de waarde van de valuta uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten op de datum van nakoming van een verplichting.  

### 4  

De valuta van een lid die in bezit is van het Fonds boven de vijfenzeventig procent van het quotum van het lid op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst en die niet wordt teruggekocht ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven, wordt teruggekocht in overeenstemming met de volgende voorschriften:

ii) Ander bezit wordt uiterlijk 4 jaar na de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst teruggekocht.    

### 5  

Wederinkopen ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven die niet zijn onderworpen aan paragraaf 2 hierboven, wederinkopen ingevolge paragraaf 4 hierboven en alle specificaties van valuta's ingevolge paragraaf 2 hierboven dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met artikel V, sectie 7 (i).  

### 6  

Alle voorschriften en regelingen, percentages, procedures en besluiten die gelden op de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst blijven van kracht totdat zij worden gewijzigd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst.  

### 7  

Voor zover geen arrangementen met een werking gelijk aan die van het bepaalde in letters (a) en (b) hieronder zijn tot stand gekomen voor de datum van de tweede wijziging van deze Overeenkomst, dient het Fonds: 

a) maximaal 25 miljoen ounces van het fijn goud dat het op 31 augustus 1975 in bezit had te verkopen aan die leden die lid waren op die datum en die ermede instemmen dit te kopen, naar verhouding van hun quota op die datum. De verkoop aan een lid ingevolge deze letter (a) vindt plaats in ruil voor zijn valuta en tegen een prijs die op het tijdstip van de verkoop gelijk is aan een bijzonder trekkingsrecht per 0,888.671 gram fijn goud, en  

b) maximaal 25 miljoen ounces van het fijn goud dat het op 31 augustus 1975 in bezit had, te verkopen ten behoeve van de ontwikkelingslanden die op die datum lid waren, echter met dien verstande dat dat deel van de winst of de surpluswaarde van het goud dat overeenkomt met het aandeel van het quotum van een zodanig lid op 31 augustus 1975 ten opzichte van het totaal van de quota van alle leden op die datum rechtstreeks wordt overgemaakt aan ieder zodanig lid. De vereisten vervat in artikel V, sectie 12 (c) dat het Fonds met een lid overleg dient te plegen, de instemming van een lid dient te verkrijgen of in bepaalde omstandigheden de valuta van een lid dient in te wisselen voor de valuta's van andere leden, gelden met betrekking tot valuta die door het Fonds wordt ontvangen als opbrengst van verkopen van goud krachtens deze bepaling, anders dan verkopen aan een lid in ruil voor zijn eigen valuta, en die wordt geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening.   Onmiddellijk na de verkoop van goud ingevolge deze paragraaf 7, wordt een bedrag van de opbrengst in de ontvangen valuta's, dat op het tijdstip van de verkoop gelijk is aan een bijzonder trekkingsrecht per 0,888.671 gram fijn goud, geboekt op de Algemene Middelenrekening; de andere activa die het Fonds bezit krachtens arrangementen ingevolge letter (b) hierboven dienen gescheiden te worden gehouden van de algemene middelen van het Fonds. Activa waarover het Fonds na beëindiging van arrangementen ingevolge letter (b) hierboven kan blijven beschikken, worden overgemaakt op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening.  

### Schema  C  

####Pari-waarden

### 1  

Het Fonds brengt aan de leden ter kennis dat voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst pari-waarden kunnen worden vastgesteld in overeenstemming met artikel IV, secties 1, 3, 4 en 5 en dit schema; deze worden uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten of in een door het Fonds voorgeschreven andere gemeenschappelijke eenheid. Deze gemeenschappelijke eenheid mag niet goud of een valuta zijn.  

### 2  

Een lid dat voornemens is een pari-waarde voor zijn valuta vast te stellen, stelt binnen een redelijk tijdvak na de kennisgeving ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven, een pari-waarde voor aan het Fonds.  

### 3  

Een lid dat niet voornemens is ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven een pari-waarde voor zijn valuta vast te stellen, pleegt overleg met het Fonds en draagt er zorg voor dat zijn wisselkoersarrangementen verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds en geschikt zijn om de ingevolge artikel IV, sectie 1 op hem rustende verplichtingen na te komen.  

### 4  

Binnen een redelijke termijn na ontvangst van een voorstel met betrekking tot een bepaalde pari-waarde stemt het Fonds hiermee in of tekent het hiertegen bezwaar aan. Een voorgestelde pari-waarde treedt niet in werking voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, indien het Fonds hiertegen bezwaar aantekent, en het lid dient zich te houden aan het bepaalde in paragraaf 3 hierboven. Het Fonds mag geen bezwaar aantekenen wegens het binnenlandse sociale of politieke beleid van het lid dat de pari-waarde voorstelt.  

### 5  

Ieder lid dat een pari-waarde voor zijn valuta heeft, verbindt zich tot het toepassen van passende maatregelen, verenigbaar met deze Overeenkomst, ten einde te verzekeren dat de maximum- en minimumkoersen voor contante valutatransacties die binnen zijn grondgebied plaatsvinden tussen zijn eigen valuta en de valuta's van andere leden die pari-waarden handhaven, met niet meer dan 4½ procent of een andere marge dan wel marges die het Fonds met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal kan vaststellen, van de pariteit verschillen.  

### 6  

Een lid mag geen verandering in de pari-waarde van zijn valuta voorstellen, behalve om een fundamentele onevenwichtigheid te corrigeren, dan wel het ontstaan hiervan te voorkomen. Een verandering kan alleen worden aangebracht op voorstel van het lid en slechts na overleg met het Fonds.  

### 7  

Wanneer een verandering in de pari-waarde wordt voorgesteld, dient het Fonds binnen een redelijke termijn na ontvangst van het voorstel hiermee in te stemmen of hiertegen bezwaar aan te tekenen. Het Fonds stemt hiermede in, indien te zijnen genoegen is aangetoond dat de verandering noodzakelijk is om een fundamentele onevenwichtigheid te corrigeren, dan wel het ontstaan hiervan te voorkomen. Het Fonds mag geen bezwaar aantekenen wegens het binnenlandse sociale of politieke beleid van het lid dat de verandering voorstelt. Een voorgestelde verandering in pari-waarde treedt niet in werking voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst indien het Fonds hiertegen bezwaar aantekent. Indien een lid de pari-waarde van zijn valuta verandert ondanks het bezwaar van het Fonds, is op dit lid artikel XXVI, sectie 2 van toepassing. Het handhaven van een irreële pari-waarde door een lid wordt door het Fonds afgeraden.  

### 8  

De ingevolge deze Overeenkomst vastgestelde pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid houdt voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst op te bestaan, indien het lid het Fonds ter kennis brengt dat het voornemens is de pari-waarde op te heffen. Het Fonds kan bij een besluit met een meerderheid van vijfentachtig procent van het totale stemmenaantal bezwaar maken tegen de beëindiging van een pari-waarde. Indien een lid een pari-waarde voor zijn valuta beëindigt ondanks het bezwaar van het Fonds, is op dit lid artikel XXVI, sectie 2 van toepassing. Een ingevolge deze Overeenkomst vastgestelde pari-waarde houdt op te bestaan voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst, indien het lid de pari-waarde opheft ondanks het bezwaar van het Fonds, of indien het Fonds tot de slotsom komt dat het lid niet, zoals bepaald in paragraaf 5 hierboven, koersen handhaaft voor een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid valutatransacties, met dien verstande dat het Fonds een zodanige uitspraak niet mag doen, tenzij het overleg heeft gepleegd met het lid en dit zestig dagen tevoren ter kennis heeft gebracht dat het Fonds voornemens is te overwegen om tot een zodanige uitspraak over te gaan.  

### 9  

Indien de pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid ingevolge paragraaf 8 hierboven heeft opgehouden te bestaan, pleegt het lid overleg met het Fonds en draagt het er zorg voor dat zijn wisselkoersarrangementen verenigbaar zijn met de doelstellingen van het Fonds en geschikt zijn om de ingevolge artikel IV, sectie 1 op hem rustende verplichtingen na te komen.  

### 10  

Een lid voor wiens valuta de pari-waarde heeft opgehouden te bestaan ingevolge paragraaf 8 hierboven, kan te allen tijde een nieuwe pari-waarde voor zijn valuta voorstellen.  

### 11  

Niettegenstaande het bepaalde in paragraaf 6 hierboven, kan het Fonds met een meerderheid van zeventig procent van het totale stemmenaantal uniforme, evenredige veranderingen aanbrengen in alle pariwaarden, indien het bijzondere trekkingsrecht de gemeenschappelijke eenheid is en de veranderingen de waarde van het bijzondere trekkingsrecht niet zullen aantasten. De pari-waarde van de valuta van een lid mag echter ingevolge deze bepaling niet worden veranderd, indien, binnen een tijdvak van zeven dagen na de maatregel van het Fonds, het lid het Fonds ter kennis brengt dat het niet wenst dat de pari-waarde van zijn valuta door een zodanige maatregel wordt veranderd.

Bij het stemmen voor de te kiezen Bewindvoerders, brengt ieder der stemgerechtigde Bestuurders op een persoon alle stemmen uit, waarop hij volgens artikel XII, sectie 5 (a) recht heeft. De vijftien personen waarop het grootste aantal stemmen is uitgebracht, zijn Bewindvoerders, met dien verstande dat een persoon die minder dan vier procent van het totale uit te brengen stemmenaantal behaalt (gerechtigde stemmen), niet als gekozen wordt beschouwd.  

### 3  

Wanneer bij de eerste stemming geen vijftien personen zijn gekozen, vindt een tweede stemming plaats, waarbij slechts stemmen (a) de Bestuurders die bij de eerste stemming hun stem hebben uitgebracht op een niet-gekozen persoon en (b) de Bestuurders wier stemmen voor een gekozen persoon overeenkomstig paragraaf 4 hieronder worden geacht het aantal op die persoon uitgebrachte stemmen te hebben gebracht boven de negen procent van de gerechtigde stemmen. Indien er bij de tweede stemming meer kandidaten zijn dan het aantal te kiezen Bewindvoerders, is de persoon die het laagste aantal stemmen ontving bij de eerste stemming, niet verkiesbaar.  

### 4  

Bij het vaststellen of de stemmen die door een Bestuurder zijn uitgebracht, moeten worden geacht het totaal voor een persoon boven de negen procent van de gerechtigde stemmen te hebben gebracht, wordt dit percentage geacht te omvatten: ten eerste de stemmen van de Bestuurder die het grootste aantal stemmen op die persoon heeft uitgebracht, vervolgens de stemmen van de Bestuurder die het op een na grootste aantal heeft uitgebracht, enz., totdat negen procent is bereikt.  

### 5  

Iedere Bestuurder van wiens stemmen een gedeelte in aanmerking moet worden genomen om het totaal, op enige persoon uitgebracht, boven de vier procent te brengen, wordt geacht al zijn stemmen op die persoon uit te brengen, zelfs indien het totale stemmenaantal voor die persoon daardoor de negen procent overschrijdt.  

### 6  

Indien na de tweede stemming geen vijftien personen zijn gekozen, zullen verdere stemmingen volgens gelijke beginselen worden gehouden, totdat vijftien personen zijn gekozen, met dien verstande dat, nadat veertien personen zijn gekozen, de vijftiende bij enkelvoudige meerderheid van de resterende stemmen kan worden gekozen en wordt geacht te zijn gekozen met al die stemmen.  

### Schema  F  

####Aanwijzing

Gedurende het eerste basistijdvak gelden de volgende regels voor aanwijzing: 

(a) Participanten die kunnen worden aangewezen ingevolge artikel XIX, sectie 5 (a) (i) worden aangewezen voor zodanige bedragen dat na verloop van tijd zoveel mogelijk gelijkheid wordt bereikt in de procentuele verhouding tussen het bezit van de participanten aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten boven hun netto-cumulatieve toewijzingen en hun officiële bezit aan goud en vreemde valuta.  

(b) De methode ter uitvoering van het bepaalde in letter (a) hierboven moet zodanig zijn dat aan te wijzen participanten worden aangewezen: 

(i) naar evenredigheid van hun officiële bezit aan goud en vreemde valuta, indien de in het bepaalde in letter (a) hierboven beschreven percentages gelijk zijn; en  

(ii) op zodanige wijze dat het verschil tussen de in het bepaalde in letter (a) hierboven beschreven percentages die laag en percentages die hoog zijn geleidelijk wordt verminderd.       

### Schema  G  

####Reconstitutie

### 1  

Gedurende het eerste basistijdvak gelden de volgende voorschriften voor reconstitutie: 

(a) 

(i) Een participant gebruikt zijn bezit aan bijzondere trekkings rechten en reconstitueert dit op zodanige wijze dat vijf jaar na de eerste toekenning en daarna aan het einde van elk kalenderkwartaal, het gemiddelde van zijn totale dagelijkse bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten over het meest recente tijdvak van vijf jaar niet minder is dan dertig procent van het gemiddelde van zijn dagelijkse netto-cumulatieve toekenning van bijzondere trekkingsrechten over hetzelfde tijdvak.  

(ii) Twee jaar na de eerste toekenning en daarna aan het einde van elke kalendermaand, maakt het Fonds berekeningen voor elke participant ten einde na te gaan of en in hoeverre de participant bijzondere trekkingsrechten dient te verwerven tussen de datum van de berekening en het einde van een tijdvak van vijf jaar ten einde te voldoen aan het vereiste in letter (a) (i) hierboven. Het Fonds stelt regelingen vast met betrekking tot de grondslagen waarop deze berekeningen worden gemaakt en ten aanzien van de tijdsbepaling voor de aanwijzing van participanten ingevolge artikel XIX, sectie 5 (a) (ii), teneinde deze te helpen voldoen aan het vereiste in letter (a) (i) hierboven.  

(iii) Het Fonds zendt een speciale kennisgeving aan een participant, indien de berekeningen ingevolge letter (a) (ii) hierboven aantonen dat het onwaarschijnlijk is dat de participant aan het vereiste in letter (a) (i) hierboven zal kunnen voldoen, tenzij hij het gebruik van bijzondere trekkingsrechten staakt voor het resterende gedeelte van het tijdvak waarvoor de berekening ingevolge letter (a) (ii) hierboven was gemaakt.  

(iv) Een participant die bijzondere trekkingsrechten dient te verwerven om aan deze verplichting te voldoen, is verplicht en gerechtigd deze tegen een voor het Fonds aanvaardbare valuta te verkrijgen in een transactie met het Fonds via de Algemene Middelenrekening. Indien op deze wijze niet voldoende bijzondere trekkingsrechten kunnen worden verkregen om aan deze verplichting te voldoen, is de participant verplicht en gerechtigd deze van een door het Fonds aan te wijzen participant te verkrijgen met een vrij te gebruiken valuta.    

(b) Participanten houden eveneens naar behoren rekening met de wenselijkheid dat na verloop van tijd een evenwichtige verhouding wordt nagestreefd tussen hun bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten enerzijds en hun andere reserves anderzijds.    

### 2  

Indien een participant de voorschriften voor het herstel van de oorspronkelijke positie niet naleeft, bepaalt hef Fonds of de omstandigheden al dan niet opschorting ingevolge artikel XXIII, sectie 2 (b) rechtvaardigen.  

### Schema  H  

####Beëindiging van participatie

### 1  

Indien de overblijvende verplichting na de verrekening ingevolge artikel XXIV, sectie 2 (b), een verplichting is jegens de zich terugtrekkende participant en niet binnen zes maanden na de datum van beëindiging overeenstemming over de afrekening is bereikt tussen het Fonds en de zich terugtrekkende participant, koopt het Fonds dit saldo van bijzondere trekkingsrechten terug binnen een maximum van vijf jaar vanaf de datum van beëindiging af in gelijke halfjaarlijkse termijnen. Het Fonds koopt dit saldo terug op door hem te bepalen wijze, hetzij (a) door betaling aan de zich terugtrekkende participant van de bedragen die de overblijvende participanten aan het Fonds verstrekken overeenkomstig artikel XXIV, sectie 5, hetzij (b) door de zich terugtrekkende participant toe te staan zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten te gebruiken ter verkrijging van zijn eigen valuta of van een vrij te gebruiken valuta van een door het Fonds aangewezen participant, van de Algemene Middelenrekening of enige andere houder.  

### 2  

Indien de overblijvende verplichting na de verrekening ingevolge artikel XXIV, sectie 2 (b) een verplichting is jegens het Fonds en niet binnen zes maanden na de datum van beëindiging overeenstemming is bereikt over de afrekening, voldoet de zich terugtrekkende participant aan deze verplichting in gelijke halfjaarlijkse termijnen binnen drie jaar na de datum van beëindiging of binnen een zodanige langere periode als het Fonds kan vaststellen. De zich terugtrekkende participant voldoet aan deze verplichting op door het Fonds te bepalen wijze, hetzij (a) door betaling aan het Fonds van een vrij te gebruiken valuta, hetzij (b) door bijzondere trekkingsrechten te verkrijgen overeenkomstig artikel XXIV, sectie 6, uit de Algemene Middelenrekening of bij overeenstemming met een door het Fonds aangewezen participant of van enige andere houder en deze bijzondere trekkingsrechten te verrekenen met de verschuldigde termijn.  

### 3  

Termijnen ingevolge paragraaf 1 of 2 hierboven worden verschuldigd zes maanden na de datum van beëindiging en met tussenpozen van zes maanden nadien.  

### 4  

In geval van liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling ingevolge artikel XXV binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop een participant zijn participatie beëindigt, geschiedt de vereffening tussen het Fonds en die Regering overeenkomstig artikel XXV en schema I.  

### Schema  I  

####Wijze van liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling

### 1  

In geval van liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling voldoen de participanten hun verplichtingen aan het Fonds in tien halfjaarlijkse termijnen, of over een zodanige langere periode als het Fonds nodig kan oordelen, in een vrij te gebruiken valuta en de valuta's van de participanten die bijzondere trekkingsrechten bezitten die in enigerlei termijn moeten worden teruggekocht, tot het bedrag van zodanige terugkoop, als bepaald door het Fonds. De eerste halfjaarlijkse termijn wordt betaald zes maanden na het besluit om de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te liquideren.  

### 2  

Indien wordt besloten het Fonds binnen zes maanden na de datum van het besluit tot liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te liquideren, vindt de liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling geen voortgang alvorens de bijzondere trekkingsrechten in de Algemene Middelenrekening zijn verdeeld overeenkomstig de onderstaande regel: Na de verdelingen ingevolge paragraaf 2 (a) en (b) van schema K, wijst het Fonds zijn bijzondere trekkingsrechten in de Algemene Middelenrekening toe aan alle leden die participant zijn, in verhouding tot de bedragen die aan elke participant zijn verschuldigd na de verdeling ingevolge paragraaf 2 (b). Ter bepaling van het aan elke participant verschuldigde bedrag voor de verdeling van het restant van zijn bezit aan iedere valuta ingevolge paragraaf 2 (d) van schema K, trekt het Fonds hiervan de verdeling af van de bijzondere trekkingsrechten verricht ingevolge deze regel.  

### 3  

Met de ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven ontvangen bedragen koopt het Fonds de bijzondere trekkingsrechten van houders terug op de wijze en in de volgorde als hieronder bepaald: 

(a) Bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van Regeringen die hun participatie hebben beëindigd langer dan zes maanden voordat de Raad van Bestuur besluit tot liquidatie van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, worden teruggekocht overeenkomstig de voorwaarden van een overeenkomst ingevolge artikel XXIV of schema H.  

(b) Bijzondere trekkingsrechten van houders die geen participant zijn worden teruggekocht vóór die welke in het bezit zijn van participanten en wel in verhouding tot het bedrag dat eerstgenoemden bezitten.  

(c) Het Fonds stelt vast welke de verhouding is tussen de bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van elke participant en zijn nettocumulatieve toewijzingen. Het Fonds koopt eerst de bijzondere trekkingsrechten terug van participanten met het grootste verhoudingsgetal totdat dit is teruggebracht tot het volgende grootste verhoudingsgetal; daarna koopt het Fonds de bijzondere trekkingsrechten in het bezit van deze participanten terug overeenkomstig hun netto-cumulatieve toewijzingen, totdat hun aldus verminderd verhoudingsgetal is teruggebracht tot het volgende grootste verhoudingsgetal; deze werkwijze wordt voortgezet tot het voor terugkoop beschikbare bedrag is uitgeput.    

### 4  

Ieder bedrag waarop een participant recht heeft bij terugkoop ingevolge paragraaf 3 hierboven, wordt verrekend met ieder bedrag dat moet worden betaald ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven.  

### 5  

Tijdens de liquidatie betaalt het Fonds rente over het bedrag van de bijzondere trekkingsrechten van houders en betaalt elke participant provisies over zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten verminderd met het bedrag van betalingen verricht overeenkomstig paragraaf 1 hierboven. De rentevoet en de hoogte van de provisies, alsmede het tijdstip van betaling worden door het Fonds vastgesteld. Betalingen van rente en provisies worden zo veel mogelijk verricht in bijzondere trekkingsrechten. Een participant die niet voldoende bijzondere trekkingsrechten bezit om provisies te voldoen, verricht de betaling met een door het Fonds gespecificeerde valuta. Bijzondere trekkingsrechten die worden ontvangen als provisies worden niet gebruikt voor de betaling van rente voor zover zij nodig zijn voor administratiekosten, doch worden overgemaakt aan het Fonds en worden het eerst teruggekocht en wel met de valuta's die door het Fonds worden gebruikt voor betaling van zijn onkosten.  

### 6  

Zolang een participant achterstallig is met betrekking tot enige betaling vereist in paragraaf 1 of 5 hierboven, worden hem geen bedragen betaald overeenkomstig paragraaf 3 of 5 hierboven.  

### 7  

Indien na de slotbetalingen aan de participanten niet iedere participant die niet achterstallig is bijzondere trekkingsrechten bezit in dezelfde verhouding tot zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing, moeten participanten met een kleiner verhoudingsgetal van die met een groter verhoudingsgetal overeenkomstig door het Fonds getroffen regelingen zodanige bedragen kopen, dat de verhoudingsgetallen van hun bezit aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten dezelfde worden. Elke achterstallige participant moet het Fonds zijn eigen valuta betalen tot een met deze achterstalligheid gelijk bedrag. Het Fonds verdeelt deze valuta en eventuele overblijvende vorderingen tussen participanten in verhouding tot het bedrag aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten dat elk bezit en deze bijzondere trekkingsrechten worden ingetrokken. Het Fonds sluit dan de boeken van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling af; alle verplichtingen van het Fonds voortvloeiend uit de toewijzingen van bijzondere trekkingsrechten en het beheer van de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling nemen een einde.  

### 8  

Elke participant wiens valuta ingevolge dit schema wordt toegedeeld aan andere participanten garandeert te allen tijde een onbeperkt gebruik daarvan voor de aankoop van goederen of voor betaling van bedragen die aan hem zelf of aan personen binnen zijn grondgebied zijn verschuldigd. Elke participant die deze verplichting heeft, stemt erin toe andere participanten schadeloos te stellen voor alle verliezen die ontstaan uit het verschil tussen de waarde waartegen het Fonds zijn valuta ingevolge dit schema verdeelde en de waarde welke die participanten bij beschikking over zijn valuta verkrijgen.  

### Schema  J  

####Vereffening der rekeningen met uitgetreden leden

### 1  

De vereffening der rekeningen met betrekking tot de Algemene Middelenrekening vindt plaats overeenkomstig het bepaalde in paragraaf 1 tot 6 van dit schema. Het Fonds is verplicht aan een uitgetreden lid een bedrag uit te betalen gelijk aan diens quotum, plus alle andere door het Fonds aan het lid verschuldigde bedragen, verminderd met eventuele aan het Fonds verschuldigde bedragen, waaronder begrepen kosten die na de datum van zijn uittreding ontstaan; geen betaling vindt echter plaats vóór zes maanden na de datum van uittreding. De betalingen geschieden in de valuta van het uitgetreden lid en tot dit doel kan het Fonds naar de Algemene Middelenrekening het bezit aan de valuta van het lid in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening of in de Investeringsrekening overmaken in ruil voor een gelijkwaardig bedrag aan de valuta's van andere leden in de Algemene Middelenrekening; deze valuta's worden met instemming van de desbetreffende leden door het Fonds gekozen.  

### 2  

Indien het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een uitgetreden lid niet toereikend is voor de betaling van het door het Fonds verschuldigde netto-bedrag, wordt het restant betaald in een vrij te gebruiken valuta of op overeengekomen andere wijze. Indien het Fonds en het uitgetreden lid niet binnen zes maanden na de datum van uittreding tot overeenstemming komen, wordt de desbetreffende valuta die in het bezit is van het Fonds onverwijld aan het uittredende lid uitbetaald. Een eventueel nog verschuldigd saldo wordt in tien halfjaarlijkse termijnen betaald gedurende de vijf daaropvolgende jaren. Iedere zodanige termijn wordt, naar keuze van het Fonds, betaald in de valuta van het uitgetreden lid verworven na diens uittreding, dan wel in een vrij te gebruiken valuta.  

### 3  

Indien het Fonds met betaling van een van de overeenkomstig de bovenstaande paragrafen verschuldigde termijnen in gebreke blijft, heeft het uitgetreden lid het recht betaling van het Fonds te eisen in ongeacht welke valuta die in het bezit van het Fonds is, met uitzondering van een valuta die ingevolge artikel VII, sectie 3 schaars is verklaard.  

### 4  

Indien het bezit van het Fonds aan de valuta van een uitgetreden lid het aan dat lid verschuldigde bedrag overtreft, en indien omtrent de vereffening der rekeningen niet binnen zes maanden na de datum van uittreding overeenstemming is bereikt, is het gewezen lid verplicht het bedrag van zijn valuta dat zijn quotum te boven gaat, terug te kopen in een vrij te gebruiken valuta. De terugkoop geschiedt tegen de koersen waartegen het Fonds zodanige valuta's zou verkopen op het tijdstip van uittreding uit het Fonds. Het uitgetreden lid dient de volledige terugkoop te bewerkstelligen binnen vijf jaren na de datum van zijn uittreding, of binnen een langer, door het Fonds vast te stellen tijdvak, maar het is niet verplicht in enige halfjaarlijkse periode meer dan een tiende deel terug te kopen van het bedrag waarmede het bezit van het Fonds aan zijn valuta op de datum van uittreding zijn quotum overtreft, vermeerderd met verdere bedragen aan die valuta, die gedurende een zodanig halfjaarlijks tijdvak nog zijn verkregen. Indien het uitgetreden lid aan deze verplichting niet voldoet, kan het Fonds op ordelijke wijze het bedrag dat had moeten worden teruggekocht op ongeacht welke markt liquideren.  

### 5  

Ieder lid dat de valuta wenst te verkrijgen van een lid dat is uitgetreden, koopt deze van het Fonds, voor zover eerstgenoemd lid het recht heeft gebruik te maken van de middelen van het Fonds en zodanige valuta overeenkomstig paragraaf 4 hierboven beschikbaar is.  

### 6  

Het uitgetreden lid garandeert te allen tijde het onbeperkt gebruik van de valuta die overeenkomstig paragrafen 4 en 5 hierboven is verkocht voor de aankoop van goederen of voor betaling van bedragen die aan hem zelf of aan personen binnen zijn grondgebied zijn verschuldigd. Het stelt het Fonds schadeloos voor alle verliezen die ontstaan uit het verschil tussen de waarde van zijn valuta, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, op de datum van uittreding, en de waarde in bijzondere trekkingsrechten die het Fonds bij verkoop ingevolge paragrafen 4 en 5 hierboven verkrijgt.  

### 7  

Indien het uitgetreden lid schulden heeft jegens het Fonds als gevolg van transacties via de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening krachtens artikel V, sectie 12 (f) (ii), worden deze schulden voldaan in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden waarop zij zijn aangegaan.  

### 8  

Indien het Fonds de valuta van het uitgetreden lid bezit in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening of in de Investeringsrekening, kan het Fonds op ordelijke wijze op ongeacht welke markt het bedrag van de valuta van het uitgetreden lid dat overblijft na gebruik ingevolge paragraaf 1 hierboven, inwisselen voor de valuta's van de leden, en de opbrengst van het inwisselen van het bedrag in elke rekening wordt in die rekening gehouden. Paragraaf 5 hierboven en de eerste zin van paragraaf 6 hierboven zijn van toepassing op de valuta van het uitgetreden lid.  

### 9  

Indien het Fonds ingevolge artikel V, sectie 12 (h) obligaties van het uitgetreden lid bezit in de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening, dan wel in de Investeringsrekening, kan het Fonds deze houden tot aan de vervaldatum, of hierover eerder beschikken. Paragraaf 8 hierboven is van toepassing op de opbrengst van een zodanige desinvestering.  

### 10  

Ingeval het Fonds binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop het lid uittreedt in liquidatie gaat overeenkomstig artikel XXVII, sectie 2, worden de rekeningen tussen het Fonds en die Regering vereffend in overeenstemming met artikel XXVII, sectie 2 en schema K.  

### Schema  K  

####Wijze van liquidatie

### 1  

In geval van liquidatie heeft de betaling der schulden van het Fonds, de terugbetaling der bijdragen daargelaten, voorrang bij de verdeling der activa van het Fonds. Bij de betaling van iedere zodanige schuld wendt het Fonds zijn activa in de onderstaande volgorde aan: 

(a) de valuta waarin de schuld luidt;  

(b) goud;  

(c) alle andere valuta's, voor zover mogelijk in verhouding tot de quota der leden.    

### 2  

Na voldoening der schulden van het Fonds in overeenstemming met paragraaf 1 hierboven, wordt het saldo van de activa van het Fonds in de volgende verhouding toegewezen: 

(a) 

(i) Het Fonds berekent de waarde van het goud dat het op 31 augustus 1975 bezat en dat het nog steeds bezit op de datum van het besluit tot liquidatie. De berekening geschiedt in overeenstemming met paragraaf 9 hieronder en tevens op basis van een bijzonder trekkingsrecht per 0,888.671 gram fijn goud op de datum van liquidatie. Een hoeveelheid goud die gelijkwaardig is aan het bedrag waarmede eerstgenoemde waarde de laatstgenoemde overschrijdt, wordt toegedeeld aan de leden die lid waren op 31 augustus 1975, naar verhouding van hun quota op die datum.  

(ii) Het Fonds deelt alle activa die op de datum van het besluit tot liquidatie geboekt staan op de Bijzondere Aanwendingsrekening toe aan die leden die lid waren op 31 augustus 1975, naar verhouding van hun quota op die datum. Ieder soort activa wordt naar evenredigheid aan de leden toegedeeld.    

(b) Het Fonds verdeelt zijn resterende bezit aan goud over de leden wier valuta's door het Fonds worden gehouden in bedragen die lager zijn dan hun quota, naar evenredigheid van, maar niet tot een hoger bedrag dan, de bedragen waarmee hun quota het bezit van het Fonds aan hun valuta's overtreffen.  

(c) Het Fonds deelt aan ieder lid de helft van het bezit van het Fonds aan diens valuta toe, maar een zodanige verdeling mag niet meer belopen dan vijftig procent van het quotum van dat lid.  

(d) Het Fonds verdeelt het restant van zijn bezit aan goud en aan iedere valuta: 

(i) tussen alle leden naar evenredigheid van, maar niet tot een hoger bedrag dan, de bedragen die aan ieder lid zijn verschuldigd na de verdelingen ingevolge letters (b) en (c) hierboven, met dien verstande dat met de verdeling ingevolge paragraaf 2 (a) hierboven geen rekening wordt gehouden bij het vaststellen van de verschuldigde bedragen, en  

(ii) elk extra bezit aan goud en valuta tussen alle leden, naar evenredigheid van hun quota.      

### 3  

Ieder lid koopt het ingevolge paragraaf 2 (d) hierboven aan andere leden toegewezen bedrag van zijn valuta terug en komt binnen drie maanden na het besluit tot liquidatie, met het Fonds een ordelijke procedure voor deze terugkoop overeen.  

### 4  

Indien een lid binnen de hierboven onder paragraaf 3 vermelde termijn van drie maanden niet met het Fonds tot overeenstemming is gekomen, gebruikt het Fonds de ingevolge paragraaf 2 (d) hierboven aan dat lid toegewezen valuta's van andere leden voor het terugkopen van zijn valuta die aan andere leden is toegewezen. Iedere valuta die is toegewezen aan een lid dat niet tot overeenstemming is gekomen, wordt, voor zover mogelijk, gebruikt om de valuta van dat lid die is toegewezen aan leden die wel met het Fonds ingevolge paragraaf 3 hierboven tot overeenstemming zijn gekomen, terug te kopen.  

### 5  

Indien een lid overeenkomstig paragraaf 3 hierboven met het Fonds tot overeenstemming is gekomen, gebruikt het Fonds de valuta van de andere leden die aan dat lid ingevolge paragraaf 2 (d) hierboven zijn toegewezen, om de valuta van dat lid, die is toegewezen aan de andere leden die met het Fonds tot overeenstemming zijn gekomen, als onder paragraaf 3 hierboven, terug te kopen. Ieder op die wijze teruggekocht bedrag wordt ingekocht in de valuta van het lid waaraan het was toegedeeld.  

### 6  

Na uitvoering van de in bovenstaande paragrafen vermelde maatregelen betaalt het Fonds aan ieder lid de overblijvende valutabedragen uit, die het nog voor rekening van dat lid houdt.  

### 7  

Ieder lid welks valuta ingevolge paragraaf 6 hierboven aan andere leden is toegewezen, koopt deze valuta terug in de valuta van het lid dat de terugkoop verzoekt, of op iedere andere wijze die tussen hen wordt overeengekomen. Indien de betrokken leden niet anders overeenkomen, voltooit het lid dat tot terugkoop is verplicht deze binnen vijf jaar na de datum van verdeling, maar is het niet verplicht gedurende elke halfjaarlijkse periode meer terug te kopen dan een tiende van het aan ieder lid toegewezen bedrag. Indien het lid niet aan deze verplichting voldoet, kan het bedrag dat had moeten worden teruggekocht op ordelijke wijze op ongeacht welke markt worden geliquideerd.  

### 8  

Ieder lid welks valuta volgens paragraaf 6 hierboven aan andere leden is toegewezen, garandeert te allen tijde een onbeperkt gebruik daarvan voor de aankoop van goederen of voor betaling van bedragen die aan hen zelf of aan personen binnen zijn grondgebieden zijn verschuldigd. Ieder aldus verplicht lid stemt erin toe andere leden schadeloos te stellen voor alle verliezen die ontstaan uit een verschil tussen de waarde van zijn valuta, uitgedrukt in bijzondere trekkingsrechten, op de datum van het besluit tot liquidatie van het Fonds, en de waarde in bijzondere trekkingsrechten welke die leden bij verkoop van zijn valuta verkrijgen.  

### 9  

Het Fonds stelt de waarde van goud ingevolge dit schema vast op basis van de prijzen op de markt.  

### 10  

Voor de toepassing van dit schema worden de quota geacht te zijn vermeerderd tot de volledige hoogte die zij hadden kunnen aannemen in overeenstemming met artikel III, sectie 2 (b) van deze Overeenkomst.  

### Schema  L  

####Opschorting van het stemrecht

In geval van opschorting van het stemrecht van een lid ingevolge artikel XXVI, sectie 2, letter b, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

1. Het lid mag niet: 

a. deelnemen aan de aanneming van een voorgestelde wijziging van deze Overeenkomst of met het oog hierop worden meegeteld voor het totale aantal leden, behalve in geval van een wijziging waarvoor aanvaarding door alle leden vereist is ingevolge artikel XXVIII, letter b, of die uitsluitend betrekking heeft op de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling;  

b. een Bestuurder of Plaatsvervangend Bestuurder benoemen, een Raadslid of Plaatsvervangend Raadslid benoemen, dan wel deelnemen aan zijn benoeming, of een Bewindvoerder benoemen of verkiezen, dan wel deelnemen aan zijn verkiezing.    

2. Het aantal stemmen dat aan het lid is toegewezen, mag in geen enkel orgaan van het Fonds worden uitgebracht. Deze stemmen worden niet begrepen in de berekening van het totale aantal stemmen, behalve ten behoeve van: 

a) de aanvaarding van een voorgestelde wijziging die uitsluitend betrekking heeft op de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling en  

b) de berekening van de basisstemmen uit hoofde van artikel XII, sectie 5, (a) (i).    

3. 

a. De Bestuurder en Plaatsvervangend Bestuurder die door het lid zijn benoemd, houden op hun ambt te vervullen.  

b Het Raadslid en het Plaatsvervangend Raadslid die door het lid zijn benoemd, dan wel aan de benoeming van wie het lid heeft deelgenomen, houden op hun ambt te vervullen, met dien verstande dat, indien dat Raadslid gerechtigd was het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat is toegewezen aan andere leden waarvan het stemrecht niet is opgeschort, er door die leden een ander Raadslid en een ander Plaatsvervangend Raadslid worden benoemd ingevolge Schema D en het Raadslid en het Plaatsvervangend Raadslid in afwachting van die benoeming hun ambt blijven vervullen, zulks evenwel ten hoogste dertig dagen te rekenen vanaf de datum van de opschorting.  

c. De Bewindvoerder die door het lid is benoemd of gekozen, dan wel aan de verkiezing van wie het lid heeft deelgenomen, houdt op zijn ambt te vervullen, tenzij die Bewindvoerder gerechtigd was het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat is toegewezen aan andere leden waarvan het stemrecht niet is opgeschort. Indien het in laatstbedoeld geval: 

i. meer dan negentig dagen duurt voordat de volgende gewone verkiezing van Bewindvoerders plaatsvindt, wordt er door die andere leden - met een meerderheid van stemmen - een andere Bewindvoerder gekozen voor het resterende deel van de ambtstermijn; in afwachting van die verkiezing blijft de Bewindvoerder zijn ambt vervullen, zulks evenwel ten hoogste dertig dagen na de datum van opschorting;  

ii. niet meer dan negentig dagen duurt voordat de volgende gewone verkiezing van Bewindvoerders plaatsvindt, blijft de Bewindvoerder zijn ambt vervullen gedurende het resterende deel van de ambtstermijn.    

4. Het lid is gerechtigd alle vergaderingen van de Raad van Bestuur, de Raad of het College van Bewindvoerders te doen bijwonen door een vertegenwoordiger, doch niet een bijeenkomst van hun commissies, wanneer er een verzoek van het lid, of een aangelegenheid die het lid in het bijzonder aangaat, wordt bestudeerd.       

### SCHEMA  M  

####Speciale eenmalige Toewijzing van Bijzondere Trekkingsrechten

1. Behoudens paragraaf 4 hieronder ontvangt ieder lid dat vanaf 19 september 1997 participant is in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling op de dertigste dag volgend op de datum van vankrachtwording van de vierde wijziging van deze Overeenkomst een toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten van een bedrag dat resulteert in zijn netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten, zijnde 29,315788813 procent van zijn quota vanaf 19 september 1997, met dien verstande dat voor participanten, van wie de quota niet zijn aangepast zoals voorgesteld in Resolutie 45-2 van de Raad van Bestuur, de berekeningen geschieden op basis van de in die resolutie voorgestelde quota.  

2. 

a. Behoudens paragraaf 4 hieronder ontvangt ieder land dat na 19 september 1997, doch binnen drie maanden na de datum waarop hij lid is geworden van het Fonds, participant wordt in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling een toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten van een bedrag dat wordt berekend overeenkomstig de letters b en c hieronder, en wel op de dertigste dag volgend op de laatste, in tijd, van de volgende data: i) de datum waarop het nieuwe lid participant wordt in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling, of ii) de datum waarop de vierde wijziging van deze Overeenkomst van kracht wordt.  

b. Voor de toepassing van letter a hierboven ontvangt iedere participant een bedrag aan bijzondere trekkingsrechten dat resulteert in diens netto-cumulatieve toewijzing van bijzondere trekkingsrechten, zijnde 29,315788813 procent van zijn quota vanaf de datum waarop het lid participant wordt in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling.

5. 

a. Indien op het tijdstip waarop ingevolge de paragrafen 1, 2 of 3 hierboven een toewijzing aan een participant is gedaan, de participant ten opzichte van het Fonds verplichtingen heeft welke nog niet zijn nagekomen, worden de aldus toegewezen bijzondere trekkingsrechten in bewaring gegeven en gehouden op een garantierekening bij de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling en aan de participant vrijgegeven nadat deze heeft voldaan aan alle niet-nagekomen verplichtingen die hij ten opzichte van het Fonds heeft.

Indien bijzondere trekkingsrechten die aan een participant zijn toegewezen op een garantierekening in bewaring worden gehouden op het tijdstip waarop de participant zijn participatie in de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling beëindigt of op het tijdstip waarop besloten wordt de Bijzondere Trekkingsrechtenafdeling te liquideren, worden deze bijzondere trekkingsrechten ingetrokken.
