### Artikel  III  

####Werkzaamheden

Afdeling 1. *Werkzaamheden, betrekking hebbende op de financiering* De Maatschappij kan haar middelen investeren in productieve particuliere ondernemingen op het grondgebied van haar leden. Een regerings- of ander openbaar belang in een dergelijke onderneming sluit een investering van de Maatschappij niet noodzakelijkerwijze uit. Afdeling 2. *Vormen van financiering* 

(a) De Maatschappij verricht geen investeringen in de vorm van investering in aandelenkapitaal. Met inachtneming van het voorgaande kan de Maatschappij haar middelen investeren in zodanige vorm of vormen, als zij onder de omstandigheden het meest geschikt acht, daaronder begrepen (maar zonder beperking) investeringen, welke de houder het recht geven op winstdeling en het recht op inschrijving op aandelen-kapitaal of conversie van de investeringen in aandelen.  

(b) De Maatschappij oefent zelf geen enkel recht op inschrijving op aandelenkapitaal of conversie van een investering in aandelen uit.   Afdeling 3. *Beginselen voor de werkzaamheden* De werkzaamheden van de Maatschappij worden geleid door de volgende beginselen: 

(i) De Maatschappij verricht geen financiering in gevallen, waarin naar haar mening voldoende particulier kapitaal op redelijke voorwaarden kan worden verkregen.  

(ii) De Maatschappij financiert geen onderneming binnen het grondgebied van enig lid, indien het lid bezwaar maakt tegen een dergelijke financiering.  

(iii) De Maatschappij stelt niet de voorwaarde, dat het provenu van enige door haar verrichte financiering moet worden besteed in de gebieden van enig bepaald land.  

(iv) De Maatschappij neemt geen verantwoordelijkheid op zich voor het bestuur van enige onderneming, waarin door haar is geïnvesteerd.  

(v) De Maatschappij verricht haar financieringen op zodanige voorwaarden als zij juist acht, met inachtneming van de behoeften van de onderneming, de risico's welke de Maatschappij aangaat en de voorwaarden, welke particuliere investeerders gewoonlijk voor soortgelijke financieringen verkrijgen.  

(vi) De Maatschappij tracht haar fondsen te laten rouleren door verkoop van haar investeringen aan particuliere investeerders, wanneer dit op bevredigende voorwaarden kan geschieden.  

(vii) De Maatschappij tracht een redelijke spreiding van haar investeringen te handhaven.   Afdeling 4. *Bescherming van belangen* Geen bepaling in deze Overeenkomst verhindert de Maatschappij, in geval van feitelijke of dreigende wanbetaling op een van haar investeringen, van feitelijke of dreigende insolventie van de onderneming waarin deze investering plaats vond of in andere situaties, welke naar de mening van de Maatschappij een dergelijke investering in gevaar dreigen te brengen, die handelingen te verrichten en die rechten uit te oefenen welke zij noodzakelijk acht voor de bescherming van haar belangen. Afdeling 5. *Toepasselijkheid van bepaalde buitenlandse deviezenbeperkingen* Gelden, welke de Maatschappij heeft ontvangen of heeft te ontvangen in verband met een door de Maatschappij in het gebied van een lid ingevolge afdeling 1 van dit artikel verrichte investering, zijn niet, uitsluitend op grond van enige bepaling van deze Overeenkomst, vrijgesteld van algemeen toepasselijke buitenlandse beperkingen, voorschriften en contrôlemaatregelen met betrekking tot deviezen, welke in de gebieden van dat lid van kracht zijn. Afdeling 6. *Diverse werkzaamheden* Naast de elders in deze Overeenkomst beschreven werkzaamheden, is de Maatschappij gerechtigd: 

(i) gelden te lenen en in verband daarmede zodanig zakelijk of ander onderpand te verstrekken als zij zal bepalen met dien verstande evenwel, dat alvorens tot openbare verkoop van haar schuldbekentenissen op de markten van een lid over te gaan, de Maatschappij de toestemming dient te hebben ontvangen van dat lid en van het lid in wiens valuta de schuldbekentenissen dienen te zijn uitgedrukt; indien en voor zover de Maatschappij uit hoofde van door de Bank verstrekte of gegarandeerde leningen schulden heeft, mag het totale bedrag dat is gemoeid met de door de Maatschappij verkregen leningen of door haar verstrekte garanties niet worden verhoogd indien, op het ogenblik waarop een verhoging wordt overwogen of ten gevolge van een eventuele verhoging, het totale bedrag der op dat ogenblik uitstaande schulden (waaronder verstrekte garanties zijn begrepen) die genoemde Maatschappij uit enigen hoofde heeft aangegaan, een bedrag gelijk aan viermaal het oorspronkelijk geplaatste kapitaal en de reserve, overschrijdt;  

(ii) gelden, welke niet benodigd zijn voor haar financiële werkzaamheden, te beleggen in zodanige schuldbekentenissen als zij kan bepalen en gelden, welke worden aangehouden voor pensioen- of soortgelijke doeleinden, te beleggen in algemeen verhandelbare waardepapieren, dit alles zonder onderworpen te zijn aan de beperkingen, welke worden opgelegd door de andere afdelingen van dit artikel;  

(iii) waardepapieren te garanderen, waarin de Maatschappij haar middelen heeft belegd teneinde de verkoop daarvan te vergemakkelijken;  

(iv) waardepapieren, welke de Maatschappij heeft uitgegeven of gegarandeerd of waarin haar middelen zijn belegd, te kopen of te verkopen;  

(v) die andere bij haar werkzaamheden behorende bevoegdheden uit te oefenen welke noodzakelijk en wenselijk zijn voor de bevordering van haar doeleinden.   Afdeling 7. *Waardering van het valutabezit* Voor geval het overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deze Overeenkomst noodzakelijk wordt enige valuta te waarderen uitgedrukt in de waarde van een andere valuta, wordt een zodanige waardering door de Maatschappij naar redelijkheid vastgesteld, na het Internationaal Monetair Fonds te hebben geraadpleegd. Afdeling 8. *Waarschuwing te plaatsen op de waardepapieren* Ieder waardepapier hetwelk door de Maatschappij is uitgegeven of gegarandeerd, draagt op de voorzijde een duidelijk zichtbare verklaring, welke doet uitkomen dat het geen schuldbekentenis van de Bank is of, tenzij dit op het waardepapier uitdrukkelijk is vermeld, van enige regering. Afdeling 9. *Verbod van politieke activiteit* De Maatschappij en haar ambtenaren mogen zich niet in de politieke aangelegenheden van enig lid mengen, noch laten zij zich bij hun beslissingen door het politieke karakter van het betrokken lid of de betrokken leden beïnvloeden. Slechts economische overwegingen spelen bij hun beslissingen een rol en deze overwegingen zullen onpartijdig tegen elkaar worden afgewogen, teneinde de in deze Overeenkomst vermelde doelstellingen te verwezenlijken.

(i) Bestuurders en plaatsvervangers verrichten als zodanig hun functies zonder een vergoeding van de Maatschappij te ontvangen.   Afdeling 3. *Stemrecht*

(b) De Raad van Directeuren van de Maatschappij is ex officio samengesteld uit iedere Bewindvoerder van de Bank die hetzij (i) is samengesteld door een lid van de Bank, dat eveneens lid is van de Maatschappij hetzij (ii) is gekozen in een vergadering waarin de stemmen van tenminste één lid van de Bank, dat eveneens lid is van de Maatschappij tot zijn verkiezing hebben bijgedragen. De plaatsvervanger van iedere zodanige Bewindvoerder van de Bank is ex officio plaatsvervangend Directeur van de Maatschappij. Een Directeur treedt af, indien het lid waardoor hij werd benoemd, of indien alle leden wier stemmen tot zijn verkiezing hebben bijgedragen, ophouden lid van de Maatschappij te zijn.  

(c) Iedere Directeur, die benoemd Bewindvoerder van de Bank is, is gerechtigd het aantal stemmen uit te brengen dat het lid, waardoor hij als zodanig werd benoemd, gerechtigd is in de Maatschappij uit te brengen.

Afdeling 5. *Voorzitter, President en personeel* 

(a) De President van de Bank is ex officio Voorzitter van de Raad van Directeuren van de Maatschappij, maar heeft geen stemrecht met uitzondering van een beslissende stem in geval van staking van stemmen.

(c) De President, de ambtenaren en het personeel van de Maatschappij volgen bij de uitoefening van hun functies uitsluitend de aanwijzingen van de Maatschappij en van geen enkele andere autoriteit. Ieder lid van de Maatschappij eerbiedigt de internationale aard van deze dienst en ziet af van alle pogingen, om iemand van hen bij de uitoefening van zijn dienst te beïnvloeden.  

(d) Rekening houdende met het allesoverheersend belang van het verzekeren van zo hoog mogelijke normen van doeltreffendheid en technische bekwaamheid wordt bij de benoeming van ambtenaren en personeel van de Maatschappij de nodige aandacht gewijd aan het belang, het personeel op een zo uitgebreid mogelijke geographische basis aan te trekken.   Afdeling 6. *Relatie tot de Bank* 

(a) De Maatschappij vormt een eenheid, welke geheel apart staat van de Bank en de fondsen van de Maatschappij zijn geheel gescheiden van die van de Bank. De bepalingen van deze afdeling verhinderen de Maatschappij niet met de Bank voorzieningen te treffen met betrekking tot faciliteiten, personeel en diensten en met betrekking tot vergoeding van administratieve uitgaven, welke in eerste instantie door een der beide organisaties ten behoeve van de andere zijn betaald.  

(b) Geen bepaling in deze Overeenkomst stelt de Maatschappij aansprakelijk voor de handelingen of verplichtingen van de Bank, of stelt de Bank aansprakelijk voor de handelingen en verplichtingen van de Maatschappij.   Afdeling 7. *Relaties met andere internationale organisaties* De Maatschappij, handelende door middel van de Bank, treft formele regelingen met de Verenigde Naties en kan soortgelijke regelingen treffen met andere openbare internationale organisaties, welke gespecialiseerde verantwoordelijkheden hebben op aanverwante gebieden. Afdeling 8. *Plaats van vestiging der kantoren* Het Hoofdkantoor van de Maatschappij is gevestigd in dezelfde lokaliteit als het Hoofdkantoor van de Bank. De Maatschappij kan andere kantoren in de gebieden van enig lid van de Maatschappij vestigen. Afdeling 9. *Plaatsen van deponering* Ieder lid wijst zijn Centrale Bank als plaats aan, alwaar de Maatschappij saldi in de valuta van dat lid of andere activa van de Maatschappij kan aanhouden of wijst, indien het geen Centrale Bank bezit, voor dit doel een andere voor de Maatschappij aanvaardbare instelling aan. Afdeling 10. *Verbindingen* Ieder lid wijst een daartoe geëigende instantie aan, waarmede de Maatschappij in verbinding kan treden in verband met ieder vraagstuk dat zich als gevolg van deze Overeenkomst kan voordoen. Afdeling 11. *Publicatie van verslagen en verschaffing van inlichtingen* 

(a) De Maatschappij publiceert een jaarverslag dat een door accountants gecertificeerde balans en winst- en verliesrekening bevat en verstrekt met geëigende tussenpozen een beknopt overzicht van haar financiële positie aan haar leden, benevens een opgave van winst en verlies, waaruit het resultaat van haar werkzaamheden blijkt.  

(b) De Maatschappij kan andere zodanige verslagen publiceren, als zij voor de vervulling van haar doel wenselijk acht.  

(c) Afschriften van alle verslagen, berichten en publicaties, welke krachtens deze afdeling worden uitgegeven, worden aan de leden verstrekt.   Afdeling 12. *Dividenden*

(b) Dividend wordt uitgekeerd naar verhouding van het aandeel van ieder lid in het kapitaal van de Maatschappij.  

(c) Dividend wordt betaald op zodanige wijze en in zodanige valuta of valuta's als de Maatschappij vaststelt.    

### Artikel  V  

####Opzegging, schorsing van het lidmaatschap, opschorting van de werkzaamheden

Afdeling 1. *Opzegging door leden* Ieder lid kan te allen tijde zijn lidmaatschap van de Maatschappij opzeggen door een schriftelijke mededeling van opzegging aan het hoofdkantoor van de Maatschappij te doen toekomen. De opzegging gaat in op de dag van ontvangst van een dergelijke mededeling. Afdeling 2. *Schorsing van het lidmaatschap* 

(a) Indien een lid tekort schiet in het nakomen van een van zijn verplichtingen tegenover de Maatschappij, kan de Maatschappij bij besluit van de meerderheid der Bestuurders, welke een meerderheid van het totale stemrecht uitoefenen, het lid schorsen. Een op deze wijze geschorst lid houdt één jaar na de datum zijner schorsing automatisch op lid te zijn, tenzij bij dezelfde meerderheid besloten wordt, het lid in ere te herstellen.  

(b) Zolang het lid geschorst is, is het niet bevoegd enige rechten uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomst uit te oefenen, behalve het recht van opzegging, maar het zal aan alle verplichtingen gebonden blijven.   Afdeling 3. *Schorsing als lid of beëindiging van het lidmaatschap van de Bank* Ieder lid, dat als lid van de Bank is geschorst, of ophoudt lid te zijn van de Bank, wordt automatisch als lid van de Maatschappij geschorst, of houdt op lid te zijn van de Maatschappij, al naar het geval zich voordoet. Afdeling 4. *Rechten en verplichtingen van regeringen, welke ophouden lid te zijn* 

(a) Wanneer een regering ophoudt lid te zijn, blijft zij aansprakelijk voor alle bedragen, welke zij aan de Maatschappij verschuldigd is. De Maatschappij treft, als onderdeel van de vereffening van de rekeningen met zodanige regering, maatregelen voor de terugkoop van de aandelen van die regering in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze afdeling, maar de desbetreffende regering zal geen andere rechten uit deze Overeenkomst kunnen putten dan die voorzien in deze afdeling en in artikel VIII (c).  

(b) De Maatschappij en de regering kunnen een regeling treffen omtrent de terugkoop van het aandelenkapitaal van zodanige regering op de voorwaarden welke onder de omstandigheden passend zijn, zonder rekening te houden met de voorzieningen van lid (c) hiernavolgend. Een zodanige regeling kan onder andere een definitieve vereffening van alle verplichtingen van de regering tegenover de Maatschappij bevatten.  

(c) Indien een zodanige regeling niet binnen zes maanden nadat de regering ophoudt lid te zijn, of op een zodanig ander tijdstip als tussen de Maatschappij en zodanige regering kan worden overeengekomen, tot stand is gebracht, is de koers waartegen de aandelen worden teruggekocht, gelijk aan de waarde van die aandelen op het tijdstip dat de regering ophield lid te. zijn, welke waarde uit de boeken van de Maatschappij dient te blijken. De terugkoop van aandelen is onderworpen aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

(i) betalingen van aandelen kunnen van tijd tot tijd worden verricht bij inlevering van de desbetreffende aandelen door de regering, in zodanige termijnen, op zodanige tijdstippen en in zodanige beschikbare valuta of valuta's, als de Maatschappij redelijkerwijze vaststelt, met inachtneming van de financiële positie van de Maatschappij;  

(ii) ieder bedrag dat aan de regering voor haar aandelenkapitaal verschuldigd is, wordt ingehouden, zolang de regering of één van haar instanties voor de betaling van enig bedrag aan de Maatschappij aansprakelijk blijft en een dergelijk bedrag kan, ter keuze van de Maatschappij, indien de vervaldag daar is, in mindering worden gebracht van het bedrag, hetwelk de Maatschappij verschuldigd is;  

(iii) indien de Maatschappij een netto-verlies lijdt op de investeringen verricht ingevolge artikel III, afdeling 1, en welke zij nog in haar bezit heeft op de datum, waarop de regering ophoudt lid te zijn, en het bedrag van een dergelijk verlies het totaal van de daartegen gevormde reserves op zodanige datum overtreft, betaalt de regering op verlangen het bedrag terug, waarmede de prijs van terugkoop van haar aandelen verminderd zou zijn, indien met zodanig verlies rekening ware gehouden op het ogenblik waarop de prijs van terugkoop werd vastgesteld.    

(d) In geen geval wordt enig bedrag, dat aan een regering voor haar aandelenkapitaal ingevolge deze afdeling verschuldigd is, eerder uitbetaald dan zes maanden na de datum, waarop de regering ophoudt lid te zijn. Indien binnen zes maanden na de datum waarop enige regering ophoudt lid te zijn de Maatschappij haar werkzaamheden conform afdeling 5 van dit artikel staakt, worden alle rechten van zodanige regering geregeld door de bepalingen van bedoelde afdeling en wordt zodanige regering voor de doeleinden van die afdeling, als lid van de Maatschappij beschouwd, met dien verstande dat zij geen stemrecht kan uitoefenen.   Afdeling 5. *Opschorting der werkzaamheden en vereffening der verplichtingen* 

(a) De Maatschappij kan bij een besluit van de meerderheid van de Bestuurders, die de meerderheid van het totale stemrecht uitoefenen, voorgoed haar werkzaamheden opschorten. Na een dergelijk besluit staakt de Maatschappij op staande voet alle werkzaamheden, met uitzondering van die, welke verband houden met de ordelijke realisatie, instandhouding en bescherming van haar activa en de vereffening van haar verplichtingen. Tot het tijdstip van de uiteindelijke vereffening van deze verplichtingen en de verdeling van deze activa blijft de Maatschappij bestaan en alle wederzijdse rechten en verplichtingen van de Maatschappij en haar leden ingevolge deze Overeenkomst duren onverminderd voort, met dien verstande, dat geen lid wordt geschorst of de mogelijkheid heeft zich terug te trekken en dat geen uitkering aan leden wordt gedaan, behalve die, welke in deze afdeling zijn geregeld.  

(b) Er wordt geen uitkering aan de leden verricht uit hoofde van hun inschrijving op het aandelenkapitaal van de Maatschappij voordat aan alle verplichtingen tegenover de crediteuren is voldaan of voorzieningen daartoe zijn getroffen en voordat de Raad van Bestuur bij besluit van de meerderheid van de Bestuurders, die een meerderheid van het totale stemrecht uitoefenen, besloten heeft tot een zodanige uitkering over te gaan.  

(c) Met inachtneming van het voorafgaande, keert de Maatschappij de activa van de Maatschappij aan de leden pro rata uit in verhouding tot een ieders aandeel in het kapitaal, onder voorwaarde van voorafgaande vereffening van alle uitstaande vorderingen van de Maatschappij op ieder lid. Een zodanige uitkering wordt verricht op zodanige tijdstippen, in zodanige valuta's, en hetzij in contanten hetzij in andere bezittingen, op de wijze zoals de Maatschappij billijk en redelijk oordeelt. De vermogensbestanddelen welke aan de verschillende leden worden uitgekeerd behoeven niet noodzakelijkerwijze gelijk te zijn, wat betreft het soort bezittingen welke worden uitgekeerd of de soort valuta waarin deze zijn uitgedrukt.  

(d) Ieder lid dat activa ontvangt welke door de Maatschappij krachtens deze afdeling worden verdeeld, geniet ten aanzien van deze activa dezelfde rechten als de Maatschappij vóór hun verdeling genoot.
