####International Convention relating to intervention on the high seas in cases of oil pollution casualties

The States Parties to the present Convention, Conscious of the need to protect the interests of their peoples against the grave consequences of a maritime casualty resulting in danger of oil pollution of sea and coastlines, Convinced that under these circumstances measures of an exceptional character to protect such interests might be necessary on the high seas and that these measures do not affect the principle of freedom of the high seas,   Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  I  

1.  Parties to the present Convention may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by oil, following upon a maritime casualty or acts related to such a casualty, which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences.   
2.  However, no measures shall be taken under the present Convention against any warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.   

### Article  II

(b) the coastal State shall notify without delay the proposed measures to any persons physical or corporate known to the coastal State, or made known to it during the consultations, to have interests which can reasonably be expected to be affected by those measures. The coastal State shall take into account any views they may submit;  

(c) before any measure is taken, the coastal State may proceed to a consultation with independent experts, whose names shall be chosen from a list maintained by the Organization;  

(d) in cases of extreme urgency requiring measures to be taken immediately, the coastal State may take measures rendered necessary by the urgency of the situation, without prior notification or consultation or without continuing consultations already begun;  

(e) a coastal State shall, before taking such measures and during their course, use its best endeavours to avoid any risk to human life, and to afford persons in distress any assistance of which they may stand in need, and in appropriate cases to facilitate the repatriation of ships' crews, and to raise no obstacle thereto;

2.  Nominations to the list may be made by Member States of the Organization and by Parties to this Convention. The experts shall be paid on the basis of services rendered by the States utilizing those services.   

### Article  V  

1.  Measures taken by the coastal State in accordance with Article I shall be proportionate to the damage actual or threatened to it.   
2.  Such measures shall not go beyond what is reasonably necessary to achieve the end mentioned in Article I and shall cease as soon as that end has been achieved; they shall not unnecessarily interfere with the rights and interests of the flag State, third States and of any persons, physical or corporate, concerned.   
3.  In considering whether the measures are proportionate to the damage, account shall be taken of: 

(a) the extent and probability of imminent damage if those measures are not taken; and  

(b) the likelihood of those measures being effective; and  

(c) the extent of the damage which may be caused by such measures.     

### Article  VI

If a procedure has been initiated between two Parties, any other Party the nationals or property of which have been affected by the same measures, or which is a coastal State having taken similar measures, may join in the conciliation procedure by giving written notice to the Parties which have originally initiated the procedure unless either of the latter Parties object to such joinder.   

### Article  3

### Article  15  

1.  If, at the end of a period of 60 days from the nomination of the second Arbitrator, the Chairman of the Tribunal shall not have been nominated, the Secretary-General of the Organization upon request of either Party shall within a further period of 60 days proceed to such nomination, selecting from a list of qualified persons previously drawn up in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 above. This list shall be separate from the list of experts prescribed in Article IV of the Convention and from the list of Conciliators prescribed in Article 4 of the present Annex; the name of the same person may, however, appear both on the list of Conciliators and on the list of Arbitrators. A person who has acted as Conciliator in a dispute may not, however, be chosen to act as Arbitrator in the same matter.

####Internationaal Verdrag inzake optreden in volle zee bij ongevallen die verontreiniging door olie kunnen veroorzaken

De Staten, Partijen bij dit Verdrag, Zich bewust van de noodzaak de belangen van hun volken te beschermen tegen de ernstige gevolgen van een ongeval op zee dat het gevaar schept van verontreiniging door olie van zee en kusten, Overtuigd dat in deze omstandigheden maatregelen van buitengewone aard ter bescherming van die belangen nodig zouden kunnen zijn in volle zee en dat deze maatregelen geen inbreuk maken op het beginsel van de vrije zee,   zijn overeengekomen als volgt:    

### Artikel  I  

1.  De Partijen bij dit Verdrag kunnen in volle zee de maatregelen nemen die noodzakelijk zijn ter voorkoming, vermindering of opheffing van ernstig en dreigend gevaar voor hun kust of daarmede samenhangende belangen door verontreiniging of dreigende verontreiniging van de zee door olie, na een ongeval op zee of na met zulk een ongeval verband houdende handelingen waarvan redelijkerwijs kan worden aangenomen dat zij zeer ernstige schade tot gevolg zullen hebben.   
2.  Er worden evenwel ingevolge dit Verdrag geen maatregelen genomen tegen oorlogsschepen of andere schepen die eigendom zijn van of geëxploiteerd worden door een Staat en die te dien tijde slechts worden gebruikt in dienst van de overheid voor andere dan handelsdoeleinden.   

### Artikel  II  

Voor de toepassing van dit Verdrag: 

1. wordt onder „ongeval op zee” verstaan een aanvaring, stranding of een ander ongeval bij de navigatie of een ander voorval aan boord van een schip of daarbuiten dat materiële schade of dreigend gevaar van materiële schade aan een schip of zijn lading tot gevolg heeft;

(a) maritieme bedrijvigheid op of voor de kust, in een haven of zeearm, met inbegrip van de visserij, die een hoofdmiddel van bestaan vormt voor de betrokken personen;  

(b) toeristische attracties in het betrokken gebied;  

(c) de gezondheid van de kustbevolking en het welzijn van het betrokken gebied, met inbegrip van het behoud van de levende rijkdommen van de zee en van de in het wild levende dieren;    

5. wordt onder „Organisatie” verstaan de Intergouvernementele Maritieme Consultatieve Organisatie.    

### Artikel  III  

Wanneer een kuststaat het recht tot het nemen van maatregelen overeenkomstig artikel I uitoefent, zijn de volgende bepalingen van toepassing: 

(a) alvorens maatregelen te nemen pleegt de kuststaat overleg met de andere door het ongeval op zee getroffen Staten, in het bijzonder met de vlaggestaat of -staten;  

(b) geeft de kuststaat onverwijld kennis van de maatregelen die hij zich voorstelt te nemen aan alle natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen waarvan het de kuststaat bekend is, of met betrekking waartoe de kuststaat tijdens het overleg is medegedeeld dat zij belangen hebben waarvan redelijkerwijs kan worden verwacht dat zij door deze maatregelen worden getroffen. De kuststaat houdt rekening met de door hen naar voren gebrachte zienswijze;  

(c) alvorens maatregelen te nemen kan de kuststaat overleg plegen met onafhankelijke deskundigen die worden gekozen uit een door de Organisatie bijgehouden lijst;  

(d) in uiterst dringende gevallen die onmiddellijk ingrijpen noodzakelijk maken kan de kuststaat de maatregelen nemen die door de urgentie van de situatie zijn geboden, zonder voorafgaande kennisgeving of overleg of zonder een reeds aangevangen overleg voort te zetten;  

(e) alvorens zodanige maatregelen te nemen en bij hun uitvoering zal een kuststaat naar beste vermogen alle gevaar voor mensenlevens vermijden en personen in nood alle hulp bieden die zij mochten behoeven en in daarvoor in aanmerking komende gevallen de repatriëring van de bemanning van schepen vergemakkelijken en deze niet belemmeren;  

(f) maatregelen, genomen ingevolge artikel I, worden onverwijld ter kennis gebracht van de Staten en van de betrokken natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen welke bekend zijn, alsmede van de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie.    

### Artikel  IV  

1.  Onder toezicht van de Organisatie wordt een lijst opgesteld en bijgehouden van deskundigen als bedoeld in artikel III van dit Verdrag. De Organisatie vaardigt de nodige voorschriften uit, met inbegrip van de vaststelling van de vereiste bekwaamheden.   
2.  Lid-Staten van de Organisatie en Partijen bij dit Verdrag kunnen voordrachten doen voor die lijst. De deskundigen worden op basis van verleende diensten betaald door de Staten die van deze diensten gebruik maken.   

### Artikel  V  

1.  Maatregelen die door de kuststaat worden genomen ingevolge artikel I moeten evenredig zijn aan de hem toegebrachte of bedreigende schade.   
2.  Deze maatregelen mogen niet verder gaan dan wat redelijkerwijze nodig is om het in artikel I genoemde doel te bereiken en moeten worden beëindigd zodra dit doel is bereikt; zij mogen niet onnodig de rechten en belangen van de vlaggestaat, van derde Staten en van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die erbij zijn betrokken, aantasten.   
3.  Bij de overweging of de maatregelen evenredig zijn aan de schade wordt rekening gehouden met: 

(a) de omvang en de waarschijnlijkheid van de dreigende schade, indien deze maatregelen niet worden genomen; en  

(b) de vermoedelijke doeltreffendheid van deze maatregelen; en  

(c) de omvang van de schade die door deze maatregelen kan worden veroorzaakt.     

### Artikel  VI  

Iedere Partij die in strijd met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag maatregelen heeft genomen die anderen schade berokkenen, is verplicht een vergoeding te betalen ter grootte van de schade veroorzaakt door maatregelen die verder gaan dan wat redelijkerwijze noodzakelijk is om het in artikel I genoemde doel te bereiken.  

### Artikel  VII  

Behalve voor zover uitdrukkelijk is bepaald, maakt niets in dit Verdrag inbreuk op elders geregelde rechten, verplichtingen, voorrechten of immuniteiten of ontneemt het een der Partijen of een betrokken natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon een rechtsmiddel waarvan hij anders gebruik zou kunnen maken.  

### Artikel  VIII  

1.  Alle geschillen tussen de Partijen omtrent de vraag of maatregelen, genomen ingevolge artikel I, in strijd zijn met de bepalingen van dit Verdrag, dan wel omtrent de verplichting tot het betalen van vergoeding ingevolge artikel VI en over het bedrag van een zodanige vergoeding worden, indien het niet mogelijk is geweest door onderhandelingen een regeling te treffen tussen de betrokken Partijen of tussen de Partij die de maatregelen heeft genomen en de natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die schadevergoeding verlangen en indien de Partijen niet anders overeenkomen, op verzoek van een der betrokken Partijen, onderworpen aan een procedure tot verzoening, of, indien geen verzoening tot stand komt, aan arbitrage zoals nader omschreven in de Bijlage bij dit Verdrag.   
2.  De Partij die de maatregelen heeft genomen, is niet gerechtigd een verzoek om verzoening of arbitrage ingevolge de bepalingen van het voorgaande lid af te wijzen op de enkele grond dat niet alle rechtsmiddelen die hij volgens zijn wet voor zijn eigen gerechten zou kunnen inroepen, zijn uitgeput.

### Bijlage  

### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Verzoening

### Artikel  1  

Tenzij de betrokken Partijen anders besluiten, wordt de verzoeningsprocedure gevoerd met inachtneming van de bepalingen vervat in dit Hoofdstuk.  

### Artikel  2  

1.  Op het door een Partij, overeenkomstig artikel VIII van het Verdrag, aan de andere Partij gerichte verzoek, wordt een Verzoeningscommissie ingesteld.   
2.  Het verzoek om verzoening ingediend door een Partij bevat een voordracht van de zaak en gaat vergezeld van schriftelijke bewijsstukken ter ondersteuning.   
3.  Indien tussen twee Partijen een procedure is aangevangen, kan elke andere Partij wier onderdanen of eigendommen door dezelfde maatregelen zijn getroffen of die, als kuststaat, dergelijke maatregelen heeft genomen, zich voegen in de verzoeningsprocedure, door schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Partijen die de procedure oorspronkelijk zijn aangevangen, tenzij een van die Partijen zich daartegen verzet.   

### Artikel  3  

1.  De Verzoeningscommissie bestaat uit drie leden: een lid benoemd door de kuststaat die de maatregelen nam, een lid benoemd door de Staat wiens onderdanen of eigendommen door die maatregelen werden getroffen en een derde die de Commissie voorzit en die in onderlinge overeenstemming tussen de twee oorspronkelijke leden wordt benoemd.   
2.  De leden van de Verzoeningscommissie worden gekozen uit een vooraf opgestelde lijst overeenkomstig de procedure vervat in artikel 4 hieronder.   
3.  Indien binnen een termijn van 60 dagen na de datum van ontvangst van het verzoek om verzoening de Partij tot wie dat verzoek is gericht de andere Partij bij het geschil niet in kennis heeft gesteld van de benoeming van het lid voor wiens keuze zij verantwoordelijk is of indien, binnen een tijdvak van 30 dagen na de datum van benoeming van het tweede lid van de Commissie dat door de Partijen moet worden aangewezen, de beide eerste leden niet in staat zijn geweest in onderlinge overeenstemming de Voorzitter van de Commissie aan te wijzen, gaat de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie op verzoek van een der Partijen binnen een termijn van 30 dagen over tot de vereiste benoeming. De aldus benoemde leden van de Commissie worden gekozen uit de in het voorgaande lid bedoelde lijst.   
4.  In geen geval mag de Voorzitter van de Commissie een onderdaan zijn of een onderdaan geweest zijn van een van de Partijen die de procedure zijn aangevangen, ongeacht de wijze van benoeming.   

### Artikel  4  

1.  De hiervoor in artikel 3 bedoelde lijst bestaat uit door de Partijen aangewezen personen van de vereiste hoedanigheid en wordt bijgehouden door de Organisatie. Elke Partij kan voor opneming in de lijst vier personen aanwijzen, die niet noodzakelijkerwijze haar onderdanen behoeven te zijn. Deze aanwijzingen geschieden voor een termijn van zes jaar en kunnen telkens worden vernieuwd.   
2.  In geval van overlijden of ontslag van een persoon wiens naam op de lijst voorkomt, kan de Partij die deze persoon aanwees voor het resterende deel van de ambtstermijn een vervanger aanwijzen.   

### Artikel  5  

1.  Tenzij de Partijen anders overeenkomen, stelt de Verzoeningscommissie haar eigen procedureregels vast, welke er in elk geval in moeten voorzien dat beide Partijen worden gehoord. Wat het getuigenverhoor betreft, zal de Commissie, tenzij zij met eenparigheid van stemmen anders beslist, de bepalingen in acht nemen van Hoofdstuk III van het Verdrag van 's-Gravenhage voor de vreedzame beslechting van internationale geschillen van 18 oktober 1907.   
2.  De Partijen worden voor de Verzoeningscommissie vertegenwoordigd door agenten wier taak het is als tussenpersoon tussen de Partijen en de Commissie op te treden. Elk van de Partijen kan ook de bijstand vragen van raadslieden en deskundigen, die door haar te dien einde worden benoemd en kan verzoeken alle personen wier getuigenis haar nuttig voorkomt, te doen horen.   
3.  De Commissie heeft het recht uiteenzettingen te vragen aan agenten, raadslieden en deskundigen van de Partijen, evenals aan alle personen waarvan zij het nuttig acht dat zij, met toestemming van hun Regeringen, worden opgeroepen.   

### Artikel  6  

Tenzij de Partijen anders overeenkomen, worden de beslissingen van de Commissie genomen met meerderheid van stemmen en de Commissie doet geen uitspraak met betrekking tot het geschil zelf, tenzij al haar leden aanwezig zijn.  

### Artikel  7  

De Partijen vergemakkelijken het werk van de Verzoeningscommissie en in het bijzonder, overeenkomstig hun wetgeving en met gebruikmaking van alle hun ten dienste staande middelen: 

(a) verschaffen zij de Commissie de nodige stukken en inlichtingen;  

(b) stellen zij de Commissie in staat hun grondgebied te betreden, getuigen of deskundigen te horen en de situatie ter plaatse in ogenschouw te nemen.    

### Artikel  8  

De Verzoeningscommissie heeft tot taak de geschilpunten op te helderen, te dien einde alle nodige inlichtingen door middel van getuigenverhoor of andere middelen te verzamelen, en te trachten de Partijen te verzoenen. Na onderzoek van de zaak doet de Commissie de Partijen een aanbeveling die haar passend voorkomt en bepaalt zij een tijdvak van niet langer dan 90 dagen binnen hetwelk de Partijen moeten verklaren of zij de aanbeveling al of niet aanvaarden.  

### Artikel  9  

De aanbeveling dient met redenen te zijn omkleed. Indien de aanbeveling niet geheel of gedeeltelijk het eenstemmig oordeel van de Commissie weergeeft, is elk lid gerechtigd afzonderlijk zijn oordeel te doen kennen.  

### Artikel  10  

Een verzoening wordt geacht te zijn mislukt indien, 90 dagen nadat de aanbeveling aan de Partijen is medegedeeld, een der Partijen de andere Partij niet heeft medegedeeld dat zij de aanbeveling heeft aanvaard. De verzoening wordt eveneens geacht te zijn mislukt, indien de Commissie niet binnen de in het derde lid van artikel 3 bedoelde termijn is ingesteld of, tenzij de Partijen anders zijn overeengekomen, indien de Commissie haar aanbeveling niet heeft gedaan binnen een jaar te rekenen van de datum van benoeming van de Voorzitter.  

### Artikel  11  

1.  Elk lid van de Commissie ontvangt een bezoldiging voor zijn werk; deze bezoldiging wordt vastgesteld bij overeenstemming tussen de Partijen, die elk een gelijk deel daartoe bijdragen.   
2.  De algemene kosten die voortvloeien uit de werkzaamheden van de Commissie, zullen op dezelfde wijze worden verdeeld.   

### Artikel  12  

De Partijen bij het geschil kunnen te allen tijde gedurende de verzoeningsprocedure in onderlinge overeenstemming besluiten gebruik te maken van een andere procedure voor de regeling van geschillen.  

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Arbitrage

### Artikel  13  

1.  Tenzij de Partijen anders besluiten, zal de scheidsrechterlijke procedure worden gevoerd met inachtneming van de bepalingen van dit Hoofdstuk.   
2.  Wanneer de verzoening is mislukt, kan een verzoek tot arbitrage slechts worden ingediend binnen een termijn van 180 dagen na de mislukking van de verzoening.   

### Artikel  14  

Het Scheidsgerecht bestaat uit drie leden: een scheidsman benoemd door de kuststaat die de maatregelen heeft genomen, een scheidsman benoemd door de Staat wiens onderdanen of eigendommen door die maatregelen werden getroffen en een derde scheidsman die wordt benoemd bij overeenstemming tussen de eerstgenoemde scheidslieden en die optreedt als Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht.  

### Artikel  15  

1.  Indien na het verstrijken van een termijn van 60 dagen na de benoeming van de tweede scheidsman de Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht niet is benoemd, gaat de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie op verzoek van een der Partijen binnen een termijn van nogmaals 60 dagen over tot de benoeming; hij doet daarbij een keuze uit de lijst van personen van de vereiste hoedanigheid die van tevoren is opgesteld overeenkomstig het bepaalde in artikel 4. Deze lijst is een andere dan de lijst van deskundigen voorgeschreven in artikel IV van het Verdrag en dan de lijst van leden van de Verzoeningscommissie voorgeschreven in artikel 4 van deze Bijlage; dezelfde persoon kan evenwel voorkomen zowel op de lijst van leden van de Verzoeningscommissie als op de lijst van scheidslieden. Een persoon die in een geschil is opgetreden als lid van de Verzoeningscommissie kan evenwel niet worden gekozen om op te treden als scheidsman in dezelfde zaak.   
2.  Indien binnen een termijn van 60 dagen na de ontvangst van het verzoek een van de Partijen het lid van het Scheidsgerecht voor wiens aanwijzing zij verantwoordelijk is niet heeft benoemd, kan de andere Partij de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie hiervan rechtstreeks in kennis stellen. Deze wijst de Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht aan binnen een termijn van 60 dagen; hij kiest deze uit de lijst bedoeld in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  De Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht verzoekt na te zijn aangewezen de Partij die geen scheidsman heeft gesteld, dit te doen volgens dezelfde regels en op dezelfde voorwaarden. Indien de Partij de vereiste aanwijzing niet verricht, verzoekt de Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht de Secretaris-Generaal van de Organisatie de aanwijzing te verrichten op de wijze en volgens de regels bedoeld in het voorgaande lid.   
4.  De Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht die met inachtneming van het bepaalde in dit artikel is aangewezen, mag geen onderdaan zijn of geen onderdaan zijn geweest van een van de betrokken Partijen, tenzij de andere Partij of Partijen verklaren daartegen geen bezwaar te hebben.   
5.  In geval van overlijden of in gebreke blijven van een scheidsman voor wiens aanwijzing een van de Partijen verantwoordelijk is, wijst die Partij een vervanger aan binnen een termijn van 60 dagen te rekenen van de datum van overlijden of in gebreke blijven. Indien deze Partij de aanwijzing niet verricht wordt de arbitrage voortgezet door de overblijvende scheidslieden. In geval van overlijden of in gebreke blijven van de Voorzitter van het Scheidsgerecht wordt een vervanger aangewezen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van artikel 14, of, bij gebreke van overeenstemming tussen de leden van het Scheidsgerecht, binnen een termijn van 60 dagen te rekenen van het overlijden of in gebreke blijven, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel.   

### Artikel  16  

Indien tussen twee Partijen een procedure is aangevangen, kan elke andere Partij wier onderdanen of eigendommen door dezelfde maatregelen zijn getroffen of die, als kuststaat, dergelijke maatregelen heeft genomen, zich voegen in de arbitrageprocedure door schriftelijke kennisgeving aan de Partijen die de procedure zijn aangevangen, tenzij een van die Partijen zich daartegen verzet.  

### Artikel  17  

Een ingevolge de bepalingen van deze Bijlage ingesteld Scheidsgerecht stelt zelf zijn procedureregels vast.  

### Artikel  18  

1.  Het Scheidsgerecht beslist, zowel wat betreft de procedure als de plaats waar het vergadert, als wat betreft elk daaraan voorgelegd geschil met meerderheid van stemmen; de omstandigheid dat een van de leden van het Scheidsgerecht voor wiens benoeming de Partijen verantwoordelijk waren afwezig is of zich van stemming onthoudt, verhindert niet dat het Scheidsgerecht een beslissing neemt. Bij staking van stemmen geeft de stem van de Voorzitter de doorslag.   
2.  De Partijen vergemakkelijken het werk van de Verzoeningscommissie en in het bijzonder, overeenkomstig hun wetgeving en met gebruikmaking van alle hun ten dienste staande middelen: 

(a) verschaffen zij de Commissie de nodige stukken en inlichtingen;  

(b) stellen zij de Commissie in staat hun grondgebied te betreden, getuigen of deskundigen te horen en de situatie ter plaatse in ogenschouw te nemen.     
3.  Afwezigheid of in gebreke blijven van een Partij belemmert de voortgang van de procedure niet.   

### Artikel  19  

1.  De uitspraak van het Scheidsgerecht is met redenen omkleed. Zij is definitief en er staat geen beroep tegen open. De Partijen voldoen onverwijld aan de uitspraak.   
2.  Alle geschillen die zich tussen de Partijen kunnen voordoen ten aanzien van de uitlegging en uitvoering van de uitspraak, kunnen door een Partij ter beslechting worden voorgelegd aan het Scheidsgerecht dat de uitspraak heeft gedaan of, indien dit niet beschikbaar is, aan een ander voor dit doel ingesteld Scheidsgerecht, dat is ingesteld op dezelfde wijze als het eerste Scheidsgerecht.
