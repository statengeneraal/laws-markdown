####Regionale Overeenkomst inzake de erkenning van studies en diploma's op het gebied van het hoger onderwijs in Latijns-Amerika en in het Caraïbische gebied

De Staten van Latijns-Amerika en het Caraïbische gebied, die Partij zijn bij deze Overeenkomst, Overwegend de nauwe banden van saamhorigheid die hen verbinden en die op cultureel gebied tot uitdrukking komen in de vele bilaterale, sub-regionale of regionale overeenkomsten die zij met elkaar hebben gesloten; Verlangend hun samenwerking op het gebied van het onderwijs en op dat van het gebruik van de menselijke hulpbronnen te verstevigen en uit te breiden en, met het doel de optimale integratie van het gebied te bevorderen, de toeneming van kennis te stimuleren en de culturele identiteit van hun volken te beschermen, alsmede voortdurend en geleidelijk de kwaliteit van het onderwijs te verbeteren en deel te nemen aan de vastberaden pogingen die worden ondernomen om de economische, sociale en culturele ontwikkeling en de volledige werkgelegenheid in elk land van de regio afzonderlijk en in de regio in haar geheel te bevorderen; Overtuigd dat, als onderdeel van deze samenwerking, de internationale erkenning van studies en diploma's, waardoor een grotere mobiliteit zal worden bereikt van studenten en van personen die een hoger beroep binnen de regio uitoefenen, niet alleen nuttig doch ook hoogst belangrijk is voor het bespoedigen van de ontwikkeling van de regio, daar dit inhoudt dat een toenemend aantal wetenschapsmensen, technici en deskundigen wordt opgeleid en dat van hun diensten ten volle gebruik wordt gemaakt; Opnieuw bevestigend de beginselen die zijn nedergelegd in overeenkomsten voor culturele samenwerking welke reeds tussen hen zijn gesloten, en vastbesloten deze doelmatiger toe te passen op regionaal niveau en rekening te houden met de invoering van de nieuwe beginselen die tot uitdrukking zijn gebracht in de aanbevelingen en besluiten welke te dien aanzien door de bevoegde organen van de Organisatie van de Verenigde Naties voor Onderwijs, Wetenschap en Cultuur zijn aangenomen, in het bijzonder inzake alles wat betrekking heeft op het stimuleren van de permanente educatie, de democratisering van het onderwijs, de aanvaarding en toepassing van een onderwijsbeleid dat is afgestemd op de ontwikkelingen op structureel, economisch en technisch gebied en op de veranderingen op sociaal en politiek gebied, alsmede op wat de regio op het culturele vlak samenbindt; Ervan overtuigd dat, om aan de behoeften van hun landen op voortvarende en duurzame wijze te kunnen voldoen, de onderwijsstelsels nauw verbonden dienen te zijn met de plannen voor economische en sociale ontwikkeling; Zich bewust van de noodzaak niet alleen de diploma's, getuigschriften of academische graden die dé desbetreffende persoon heeft behaald, te laten gelden maar eveneens de kennis en ervaring die hij heeft opgedaan, mee te laten tellen bij het aanleggen van maatstaven voor de beoordeling van zijn geschiktheid voor toelating tot hoger onderwijs of tot de hogere beroepen; Beseffend dat erkenning door alle Overeenkomstsluitende Staten van voltooide studies en van diploma's, getuigschriften en academische graden die zijn behaald in een van de desbetreffende landen een doeltreffend middel is om: 

(a) optimaal gebruik te maken van de voorzieningen op onderwijsgebied in de regio,  

(b) de grootst mogelijke mobiliteit te verzekeren van docenten, studenten, wetenschappelijke onderzoekers en beoefenaars van de hogere beroepen binnen de regio,  

(c) de moeilijkheden uit de weg te ruimen die men ondervindt bij terugkeer naar zijn geboorteland, nadat men in het buitenland een opleiding heeft gevolgd,  

(d) het beste en doelmatigste gebruik te maken van de menselijke hulpbronnen van de regio met het oog op het verzekeren van volige werkgelegenheid, en het voorkomen van de vlucht van het intellect naar hooggeïndustraliseerde landen;   Vastbesloten hun toekomstige samenwerking dienaangaande te regelen en te verstevigen door middel van een regionale Overeenkomst als eerste stap op de weg naar een voortvarende aanpak van alle vraagstukken op dit gebied, hetgeen hoofdzakelijk de taak zal zijn van nationale en regionale lichamen die speciaal voor dit doel zijn ingesteld,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### I  

####BEGRIPSBEPALINGEN

### Artikel  1  

Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst: 

(a) wordt verstaan onder erkenning van een buitenlands diploma, getuigschrift of een buitenlandse academische graad, de aanvaarding daarvan door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een Overeenkomstsluitende Staat en het toekennen aan de bezitters van dergelijke diploma's, getuigschriften of academische graden van dezelfde rechten die bezitters van vergelijkbare nationale diploma's, getuigschriften of academische graden genieten. Dergelijke rechten hebben betrekking op voortzetting van de studie en op uitoefening van een beroep; 

i) erkenning van een diploma, getuigschrift of academische graad met het oog op het aanvangen of voortzetten van een studie op een hoger niveau stelt de desbetreffende diplomahouder in staat, te worden toegelaten tot de instellingen voor hoger onderwijs van de Staat die dergelijke diploma's erkent, op dezelfde voorwaarden als van toepassing zijn op houders van nationale diploma's, getuigschriften of academische graden;  

ii) erkenning met betrekking tot beroepsuitoefening betekent aanvaarding van de technische bekwaamheid van de houder van het diploma, getuigschrift of de academische graad; dit kent hem dezelfde rechten en plichten toe welke nodig zijn om het desbetreffende beroep uit te mogen oefenen, als de nationale houders van diploma's, getuigschriften of academische graden. Een dergelijke erkenning ontheft een houder van een buitenlands diploma, getuigschrift of buitenlandse academische graad echter niet van de verplichting zich te houden aan andere eventuele voorwaarden die voor de uitoefening van dit beroep zijn vereist krachtens de nationale wetgeving alsmede door de bevoegde overheidsinstanties of de voor dit beroep bevoegde instanties.    

(b) wordt verstaan onder voortgezet of secundair onderwijs dat stadium in een opleiding dat volgt op het primaire of elementaire onderwijs of op het basisonderwijs en dat onder meer het stadium kan vormen dat voorafgaat aan het hoger onderwijs;  

(c) wordt verstaan onder hoger onderwijs iedere vorm van opleiding of onderzoek volgend op het voortgezet onderwijs. Dit onderwijs staat open voor een ieder die de hiervoor vereiste geschiktheid bezit, hetzij op grond van het door hem of haar behaalde diploma of getuigschrift van een voortgezette opleiding, hetzij op grond van het feit dat hij of zij voldoende scholing of kennis bezit overeenkomstig de voorwaarden die door de desbetreffende Staat voor dit doel zijn vastgesteld;  

(d) wordt verstaan onder gedeeltelijk hoger onderwijs alle opleidingen die, volgens de bij de instelling waar het onderwijs is genoten geldende normen, onvoltooid zijn wat betreft tijdsduur of de vereiste leerstof. Erkenning door een van de Overeenkomstsluitende Staten van een gedeeltelijke opleiding welke is gevolgd aan een instelling op het grondgebied van een andere Overeenkomstsluitende Staat of is gevolgd aan een instelling onder het gezag van die Staat wordt gegeven op grond van het niveau van opleiding dat de desbetreffende persoon volgens de Staat die de erkenning geeft, heeft bereikt.

iv) het aanleggen, bij het evalueren van gedeeltelijke studies, van soepele maatstaven, veeleer gebaseerd op het tot het desbetreffende tijdstip bereikte opleidingsniveau dan op de verwerkte leerstof, waarbij het interdisciplinaire karakter van hoger onderwijs niet uit het oog mag worden verloren;  

v) het onmiddellijk erkennen van studies, diploma's, academische graden en getuigschriften voor universitaire doeleinden en voor de uitoefening van een hoger beroep;
