####Verdrag inzake de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie

De Staten die partij zijn bij dit Verdrag richten hierbij op de Intergouvernementele Maritieme Consultatieve Organisatie, welke verder zal worden aangeduid met „de Organisatie”.     
### HOOFDSTUK  I  

####Doeleinden van de Organisatie

### Artikel  1  

De doeleinden van de Organisatie zijn: 

a) Het verschaffen van een gelegenheid tot samenwerking tussen Regeringen op het gebied van overheidsmaatregelen en -gebruiken die betrekking hebben op technische aangelegenheden van iedere soort betreffende de internationale koopvaardij; het aanmoedigen en vergemakkelijken van de algemene aanvaarding van de hoogst bereikbare maatstaven ten aanzien van de veiligheid ter zee, de doeltreffendheid van de navigatie en de voorkoming en bestrijding van de verontreiniging van de zee door schepen alsmede het behandelen van bestuurlijke en juridische aangelegenheden, die verband houden met de doeleinden die in dit artikel zijn gesteld;  

b) het aanmoedigen van de opheffing van discriminatoire maatregelen en onnodige beperkingen vanwege Regeringen met betrekking tot de internationale koopvaardij, teneinde de beschikbaarheid zonder discriminatie van scheepvaartdiensten voor de wereldhandel te bevorderen; steun en aanmoediging door een Regering verleend voor de ontwikkeling van haar nationale koopvaardij en ten behoeve van haar nationale veiligheid betekenen op zichzelf geen discriminatie, mits dergelijke steun en aanmoediging niet hun grond vinden in maatregelen die beogen de vrijheid van de scheepvaart van alle vlaggen om deel te nemen aan het internationale verkeer te beperken;  

c) het in overweging nemen door de Organisatie van aangelegenheden betreffende deloyale belemmerende praktijken van scheepvaart-ondernemingen in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in Hoofdstuk II;  

d) Het in overweging nemen door de Organisatie van iedere aangelegenheid betreffende de scheepvaart en de gevolgen van de scheepvaart voor het mariene milieu, die aan haar door enig orgaan of gespecialiseerde organisatie van de Verenigde Naties wordt voorgelegd;  

e) het uitwisselen van gegevens tussen Regeringen omtrent door de Organisatie in overweging genomen aangelegenheden.    

### HOOFDSTUK  II  

####Functies

### Artikel  2  

Ten einde haar doeleinden, omschreven in Hoofdstuk I, te bereiken dient de Organisatie: 

(a) met inachtneming van het bepaalde in artikel 3, aangelegenheden te bestuderen die zich voordoen ingevolge artikel 1, letters (a), (b) en (c), en die zijn verwezen naar de Organisatie door de Leden, door enig orgaan of gespecialiseerde organisatie van de Verenigde Naties of door enige andere intergouvernementele organisatie, ofwel aangelegenheden verwezen naar de Organisatie ingevolge artikel 1, letter (d), en hierover aanbevelingen te doen;  

(b) verdragen, overeenkomsten of andere passende regelingen te ontwerpen, deze aan Regeringen en intergouvernementele organisaties aan te bevelen alsmede de noodzakelijk geachte conferenties bijeen te roepen;  

(c) gelegenheid te verschaffen voor onderling overleg tussen de Leden en voor de uitwisseling van gegevens tussen de Regeringen;  

(d) de taken te vervullen die voortvloeien uit de letters (a), (b) en (c) van dit artikel, in het bijzonder die welke haar zijn opgedragen door of krachtens de internationale regelingen die betrekking hebben op maritieme aangelegenheden en de gevolgen van de scheepvaart voor het mariene milieu;  

(e) waar nodig, en overeenkomstig de bepalingen van Hoofdstuk X, de technische samenwerking binnen het werkterrein van de Organisatie te bevorderen.    

### Artikel  3  

Ten aanzien van aangelegenheden, welke de Organisatie vatbaar voorkomen om te worden geregeld op de in het internationale scheepvaartbedrijf normale wijze zal de Organisatie in die zin een aanbeveling doen. Indien naar het oordeel van de Organisatie enige aangelegenheid betrekking hebbende op deloyale belemmerende handelswijzen van scheepvaartondernemingen niet vatbaar is voor regeling op de in het internationale scheepvaartbedrijf normale wijze, of zulks in feite bewezen is en mits het vraagstuk te voren het onderwerp is geweest van rechtstreekse onderhandelingen tussen de betrokken Leden, neemt de Organisatie op verzoek van een dezer Leden de aangelegenheid in overweging.
