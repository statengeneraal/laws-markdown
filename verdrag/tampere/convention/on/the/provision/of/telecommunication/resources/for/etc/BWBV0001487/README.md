####Verdrag van Tampere inzake de levering van telecommunicatievoorzieningen voor rampenmitigatie en noodhulpoperaties

De Staten die Partij zijn bij dit Verdrag, In het besef dat de omvang, de complexiteit, de frequentie en de gevolgen van rampen sterk toenemen en in ontwikkelingslanden buitengewoon ernstige consequenties hebben, In herinnering brengend dat humanitaire hulpverleningsorganisaties betrouwbare en flexibele telecommunicatievoorzieningen nodig hebben voor de uitvoering van hun vitale taken, Voorts in herinnering brengend de essentiële rol van telecommunicatievoorzieningen bij het faciliteren van de veiligheid van het personeel dat de humanitaire noodhulp en bijstand verleent, Voorts in herinnering brengend de vitale rol van radio-uitzendingen bij het verspreiden van nauwkeurige informatie over rampen onder in gevaar verkerende bevolkingsgroepen, Ervan overtuigd dat de doelmatige en tijdige inzet van telecommunicatievoorzieningen en de snelle en efficiënte uitwisseling van nauwkeurige en betrouwbare informatie van wezenlijk belang zijn om het verlies aan mensenlevens, het menselijk lijden en de schade aan eigendommen en leefomgeving als gevolg van rampen te beperken, Bezorgd over de gevolgen van rampen voor communicatiefaciliteiten en informatiestromen, Zich bewust van de bijzondere behoefte aan technische bijstand van de minst ontwikkelde, rampgevoelige landen, teneinde telecommunicatievoorzieningen te ontwikkelen voor rampenmitigatie en noodhulpoperaties, Opnieuw bevestigend de absolute prioriteit die wordt toegekend aan levensreddende communicatie in noodsituaties in meer dan vijftig internationale regelgevende kaders, waaronder het Statuut van de Internationale Telecommunicatie Unie, Gelet op de geschiedenis van de internationale samenwerking en coördinatie bij rampenmitigatie en noodhulp, met inbegrip van de aangetoonde levensreddende rol van de tijdige inzet en het gebruik van telecommunicatievoorzieningen, Voorts gelet op het verslag van de Internationale Conferentie over communicatie bij rampen (Genève, 1990) betreffende de mogelijkheden van telecommunicatiesystemen bij de reactie op en het herstel na rampen, Voorts gelet op de dringende roep in de Verklaring van Tampere inzake communicatie bij rampen (Tampere, 1991) om betrouwbare telecommunicatiesystemen voor rampenmitigatie en noodhulpoperaties, en om een internationaal verdrag inzake communicatie bij rampen teneinde deze systemen te bevorderen, Voorts gelet op Resolutie 44/236 van de Algemene Vergadering van de Verenigde Naties, die het tijdvak 1990–2000 uitroept tot Internationaal Decennium voor de beperking van natuurrampen, en Resolutie 46/182, waarin wordt opgeroepen tot versterking van de coördinatie van humanitaire noodhulp, Voorts gelet op de prominente rol die wordt toegekend aan communicatievoorzieningen in de strategie en het actieplan van Yokohama voor een veiliger wereld, aangenomen door de Wereldconferentie inzake het beperken van natuurrampen (Yokohama, 1994), Voorts gelet op Resolutie 7 van de Wereldconferentie inzake de ontwikkeling van telecommunicatie (Buenos Aires, 1994), bekrachtigd bij Resolutie 36 van de Conferentie van gevolmachtigden van de Internationale Telecommunicatie Unie (Kyoto, 1994), die regeringen aanspoort alle praktische maatregelen te nemen om de snelle ingebruikneming en het doelmatige gebruik van telecommunicatie-apparatuur voor rampenmitigatie en noodhulpoperaties te vergemakkelijken door reglementaire belemmeringen te beperken en waar mogelijk weg te nemen en de samenwerking tussen Staten te intensiveren, Voorts gelet op Resolutie 644 van de Wereld Radiocommunicatie Conferentie

Indien een geschil tussen twee Staten die Partij zijn niet kan worden beslecht binnen zes (6) maanden na de datum waarop de schriftelijke verklaring aan een Staat die Partij is en partij is bij het geschil is overhandigd, kunnen de Staten die Partij zijn en partij zijn bij het geschil verzoeken om de goede diensten van elke andere Staat die Partij is, elke Staat, elk orgaan anders dan een Staat of elke intergouvernementele organisatie teneinde de beslechting van het geschil te vergemakkelijken.   
3.  Indien geen van de Staten die Partij zijn verzoekt om de goede diensten van een andere Staat die Partij is, een Staat, een orgaan anders dan een Staat of een intergouvernementele organisatie, of indien de verlening van de goede diensten niet binnen zes (6) maanden na indiening van het verzoek om de goede diensten leidt tot vergemakkelijking van de beslechting van een geschil, kan elk der Staten die Partij zijn en partij zijn bij het geschil: 

a. verzoeken om onderwerping van het geschil aan bindende arbitrage; of  

b. het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof, mits beide Staten die Partij zijn en partij zijn bij het geschil op het tijdstip van ondertekening of bekrachtiging van, of toetreding tot, dit Verdrag, of op enig tijdstip daarna, hebben ingestemd met de bevoegdheid van het Internationale Gerechtshof ten aanzien van dergelijke geschillen.     
4.  Ingeval de respectieve Staten die Partij zijn en partij zijn bij het geschil verzoeken om onderwerping van het geschil aan bindende arbitrage, en het geschil ter beslissing voorleggen aan het Internationale Gerechtshof, heeft voorlegging aan het Internationale Gerechtshof voorrang.   
5.  In geval van een geschil betreffende de verlening van bijstand op het gebied van telecommunicatie ingevolge artikel 4, dat rijst tussen een Staat die Partij is die verzoekt om bijstand op het gebied van telecommunicatie en een orgaan anders dan een Staat of een intergouvernementele organisatie waarvan de zetel of de vestiging is gelegen buiten het grondgebied van de desbetreffende Staat die Partij is, kan de vordering van het orgaan anders dan een Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie rechtstreeks worden gesteund door de Staat die Partij is waarin de zetel of de vestiging van het orgaan anders dan een Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie is gelegen, als zijnde een vordering van een Staat tegen een Staat ingevolge dit artikel, mits die steun niet onverenigbaar is met enige andere overeenkomst tussen de Staat die Partij is en het orgaan anders dan een Staat of de intergouvernementele organisatie die zijn betrokken bij het geschil.   
6.  Op het tijdstip van ondertekening, bekrachtiging, aanvaarding of goedkeuring van, of toetreding tot, dit Verdrag kan een Staat verklaren zich niet gebonden te achten aan één of beide procedures voor beslechting van geschillen, als bedoeld in het derde lid. De andere Staten die Partij zijn zijn niet gebonden aan een procedure voor beslechting van geschillen, als bedoeld in het derde lid, ten opzichte van een Staat die Partij is waarvoor een dergelijke verklaring geldt.
